"He’s actually got some pitches to hit," the manager said. "Those first five or six games, they really pitched him tough. Fastballs off the plate and if they were called a strike, it was a steady stream of offspeed stuff. Really nothing in the heart. The one ball that he hit off of (Cole) Hamels, ball that was left on the plate. Like anybody, if you get a mistake, you have to do damage on it. I think Ike is starting to do that. I think he’s seeing the ball better, feeling better about it."
"It’s pretty simple," added Rangers right wing Marian Gaborik, who has a four-game point streak. "The games are very tight, there aren’t a lot of odd-man rushes and everybody’s backchecking.

Still, there is fascination in hearing CEOs talk about their jobs—a fascination that Adam Bryant captures neatly in "The Corner Office." Running large, complex organizations is one of the most difficult tasks in modern society. When done well, it may even be worth the outsize compensation that it brings.

December is mostly holiday related activities: parties, school progams, concerts, shopping, gift-giving. June is full of major life events: graduations, graduations and more graduations in this school-dense area of the city, plus weddings and home moves.

Over the past 10 years, cigarette smoking has dropped by 32 percent in Maryland (double the national average) largely because of our three increases in the state cigarette tax. That has saved the lives of more than 70,000 Marylanders from early, preventable tobacco-caused death.

Then there's my brother -- only a brother can still get under your skin about a sports team after all this time. I believe, at times, he thinks less of me as a person because I have not clung to the love for a team from a state I haven't lived in since I was 10.

Rather, he further poisoned the atmosphere. If anyone thought that in his news conference Obama would offer a fresh approach, they were mistaken. Among other things, he said it was time to whack the oil companies and the rich  the oldest chestnuts in the Democrats' rhetorical grab bag. He falsely framed the issue as a choice between tax breaks for corporate jet owners and scholarships for kids.

Appraisers look at the grade of construction -- whether a house has a cookie-cutter layout with inexpensive siding or is a custom design built of brick. They look at the year a house is built, the type of neighborhood.
In 2009, Forte played through an MCL sprain. But this could be a different injury, the extent of which won't be fully known until doctors see the MRI results. One of the keys will be determining how much inflammation there is.

He also notes the hardball tactics Rubio's media handlers use to guard his image, including a well-publicized skirmish with Univision when it started to report about an old criminal arrest of Rubio's brother-in-law. Rubio's team argued that the network was going after a private citizen and said Univision offered to spike the story if Rubio agreed to an interview with their star anchor, Jorge Ramos. Univision denies that.
And the owners and players will be laughing on the way to their banks and to the penthouse suites in Las Vegas.

Occasionally viewed as a guy who does little more than a score a lot (27.8 ppg), Durant also acts as calming influence on a young team many favor to come out of the West. He never shies from the game’s biggest shots, and his ability to drain them remains underrated. Without him, the Thunder would be the Rockets, who were eliminated from playoff contention Sunday night. Without LeBron, the Heat would still be pretty darn good. Rookie of the Year: Kyrie Irving, PG, Cavaliers

I commandeer the stove, all six burners, for simmering kettles of fat and meat, and the oven for slow-cooking terrines. The counter becomes charcuterie central, loaded with brick-topped pates, platters of freshly stuffed sausages, and baking sheets covered with crepinettes wrapped in lacy caul fat. The refrigerator is the repository of pate de campagne, parsleyed ham, rillettes, pheasant crepinettes and chicken liver mousse.

While it's fun to dress up your little one for a special picture, Anne Geddes said that for natural-looking photographs it's best not to overthink the shot. "Try to keep your images as simple as possible – don't have cluttered backgrounds or overdress your baby – their little bodies are beautiful just as they are. Go in as close as possible and get down to your child's level; it will help you to see their world from their vantage point, and the camera relates well to that."

How about the move by Ware on a 10-yard gain in the second quarter to turn a second-and-20 into a third-and-10? He juked DB Adams right out of his cleats. In watching the play again, it looked like Ware didn’t follow his initial blocking but certainly made up for it with some moves. Ware looked pretty good out there.

"I have no knowledge of any parishioner of St. Mary's sending such a letter or audio/video tape to you," Rowe wrote to Braxton last week.
And, as we know, our criminal justice system is still deeply scarred by racial bias. A disproportionate number of those with criminal records come from low-income communities of color. African Americans and Latinos are more likely to be arrested than whites, more likely to be charged once arrested, and more likely to be convicted and incarcerated when charged. For minority job-seekers, as the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law noted in written testimony to the EEOC in 2011, old arrests and minor convictions can turn into life sentences of joblessness.

In 1985 through 1987, the presentation stated that a tax appeal with Coastal resulted in a $5 million ruling against the township. It noted that ruling demonstrates that sale of a refinery will be a strong factor in the court’s determination of value, that assessment on a CoGen facility located on Eagle Point is vulnerable to drastic reduction and that the 2011 assessment is difficult to defend because of the closure of the refinery.

"Both teams are in a similar situation in this game," said USA head coach Kevin Boyle (Montverde Academy, Fla.). "The World Team also will have just a handful of practices to come together. Some of our players have played together and played international basketball and some have not. We are going to try and develop our chemistry and our rotation quickly and get our guys to understand their roles. It's not an all-star game, and we will be playing to win. Not everyone will have the same amount of shots or minutes. It will be whoever is most deserving based on practices and preparation."

This quirk in the record books has benefited buildings like Chicago's recently opened Trump International Hotel and Tower. It is routinely listed as being between 119 to 139 feet taller than the Empire State Building, thanks to the antenna-like mast that sits on its roof, even though the average person, looking at the two buildings side by side, would probably judge the New York skyscraper to be taller.

Our top pick for the spring, this extravaganza at the fabled Merriweather Post Pavilion, between Washington, DC and Baltimore, understands perfectly how to put together a lineup that will attract all those cool kids that simultaneously like electronic dance music, rap and indie rock. Avicii (who will kick off his all-arena tour on May 17), Kid Cudi and the Shins are the biggest names on a bill that also includes Explosions in the Sky and Fitz and the Tantrums. And the food options are excellent as well: The festival is working with Serious Eats to bring in vendors like Jose Andres’ Pepe Truck, Toki Underground and New York’s Shake Shack, Roberta’s and Momofuku Milk Bar. $75 general admission, $125 VIP, sweetlifefestival.com
The menu refers to the salmon as "fresh" and "artfully seasoned." But the color and flavor suggested the salmon was nothing exceptional. As for artful, perhaps a sous chef stood on a ladder and flung the salt and pepper at the fish à la Jackson Pollock. The dish was passable but hardly suitable for framing.

Papa’s Tomato Pies, 804 Chambers St., Trenton; (609) 392-0359. Owner Nick Azzaro shook up the pizza world this summer when he proclaimed that Papa’s, which opened in 1912, is the nation’s oldest pizzeria; Lombardi’s in New York City, which started selling pizza in 1905 but shut down for 10 years, has long claimed the honor. There’s no dispute about this: Papa’s makes great pizza — thin, crispy, tomatoey.

My gut tells me they're in the bottom three. And that means Jordan is in trouble. Frankly, she just confuses me. She comes off so sexy in her solos. In fact, she does sexy better then anyone else on the show this season. But there's an immaturity about her during her partner work that I just cant quite put my finger on. On the other hand, Tadd had quietly positioned himself as the top male dancer on the show. No one has come further this season.
The fieldstone extends to the lower level, where Dean punched out circles within the stone, creating little caves for the grandkids to climb into. He also built a bunkhouse and playroom down there.
Owendoff was a regular on OregonLive, posting more than 200 comments since last June.

My friend's Rambler was a noisy, boxy clunker. The seats were shredded; the steering was nearly metaphysical. And then there was oil. It burned oil. It dripped oil. Lots of it. We would drive out to the ranch leaving a blue cloud of smoke legal only in Texas. The cloud swelled in a huge belch every time the engine slowed. This was a huge, threatening offshore fog of blue unburnt oil mist that could have been used to control tsetse infestations in Buganda. The fault was obviously that the engine was poorly made, of cheap alloys and assembled to tolerances of "looks OK to me," the standard at American Motors. As a consequence, the plugs fouled and the car started only with a four-man push or a roll down a steep hill, of which there were none in old El Paso.
coverage for workers and through which people who need individual insurance plans can shop for them. The idea is to create a marketplace similar to that enjoyed by large employers, ones with broader and stabler risk pools, lower administrative and transactional costs, increased competition among insurance carriers and greater choice for consumers.

At the end of the letter, she writes "P.S. and I only went to high school." I guess she is implying I wasted my money on college.

This was her second marriage, and she had five children with her first husband, from whom she is divorced.
Commissioners do have a chance to discuss items publicly before the board acts on them — if only a couple of hours before. This occurs during meetings of the board’s committees on the morning of the full board’s monthly gathering that afternoon. Typically, finance, construction, planning and other committee meetings involve staff presentations on projects or initiatives, with an opportunity for commissioners on each committee to raise questions or concerns before the committee recommends that the full board approve the item.

"It was an awful accident," Seper said.
Note that Parini omits the definite article in anointing these tomes. His subtitle is not "the thirteen books that changed America." In fact, he appends a catalog of "One Hundred More Books" that altered our collective consciousness. Not to worry, we still have plenty to debate. Where, for instance, is Herbert Croly's "The Promise of American Life" (1909), which merely redefined American liberalism into its modern meaning of using "Hamiltonian means to achieve Jeffersonian ends"?
Peña, Ben Zobrist and Elliot Johnson homered as Tampa Bay rallied to bail out Jeremy Hellickson after an ineffective start. But the Rays fell to 13-2 at home and failed in their bid to become the first major-league team to reach 20 wins this season.

&hellip The people here seemed in a very different mood from those in my part of town. They were seated on their stoops , disheveled and hatless, half dressed and excited. We felt a short, jerky, ugly shock. The people all screamed and jumped. An automobile, a horse started to run. I hurried home in the center of the street. Men cried out: "Lady, be careful of electric wires overhead." It was all very disagreeable and I was glad to get home.
The trip will be the former Massachusetts governor's third to Ohio in three weeks and will mark the second time he has followed Obama to this ever-important swing state during that same period.

In 2002, voters implicitly vetoed Mr. Glendening's attempt to kill the InterCounty Connector (ICC) when they elected Gov.Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.to replace him. But the bureaucrats ultimately fooled everyone when massive toll increases throughout the state became necessary to pay for it. Then they sold us a billion dollar "express toll" lane plan for I-95, which will not attract sufficient users to cover its costs for decades, if ever.
Women may be better able to cope with sleep deprivation than are men, probably because they get more deep sleep, recent research suggests. A small study, presented at the American Academy of Sleep Medicine's annual meeting, aimed to mimic the common practice of people not getting enough sleep during the work week and then trying to make up for it on the weekends. Both men's and women's performance on a 10-minute computer task that measured reaction time and speed, among other variables, deteriorated after five nights of only six hours of sleep.

Nonetheless, McCarthy said police on the street Tuesday did a good job of carrying out their recent training.
I'm not naive enough to think that maintaining the state parks in hard times is an easy choice. Other priorities are competing for limited resources. In the past, the popular beaches and parks subsidized important but less-visited spots. Now, a kind of state park Darwinism is in vogue, with the strong and profitable surviving and the others padlocked or sold off. There are even those, including my newspaper's editorial page, who think there should be no extensive public system of state parks at all.

After five levy defeats, no new operating money since 1992 and a drastic loss of local revenue because of foreclosures and delinquencies, the Garfield Heights schools have hit that proverbial spot between the rock and a hard place: To restore full classes, the schools need a bunch more money, but with 65 percent poverty among students, how many residents can afford to pay hundreds of dollars a year more? This gap between haves and have-nots in education funding in Ohio is egregious, but it's also unacceptable that Garfield Heights teachers and administrators continue to get step-up pay increases.

That includes Christian Moueix of Dominus Estate. An empty field in front of his Yountville property, where Merlot once grew, is clear evidence of his decision that Napa's loamy and gravelly benchland isn't Merlot country. You can question the proprietor of Chateau Petrus about many things, but this grape - the raw material for the world's most expensive Bordeaux - is not one of them. And he's not alone.
German, Belgian and American brewers each impart their own twists to wheat-beer recipes. German-style hefeweizens are brewed with yeasts that produce aromas and flavors reminiscent of bananas, bubble gum and cloves. Belgian-style witbiers are often spiced with coriander and orange peel. And American wheat ales - my favorite of the bunch - showcase clean, refreshing qualities by letting their malted grains stand out more so than yeasts or spices.

Legal scholars aren’t sure what would happen if Christie ignores a court order to pump additional money into public schools. Could Christie, a lawyer by trade, be disbarred?

The evolution of Patagonia into a clothing company began in the 1970s, when Chouinard—then a world-class mountain climber and a designer of mountaineering equipment—started importing durable rugby shirts and corduroy knickers for his climber pals to wear. Soon enough, Patagonia was designing its own line of clothes. Soon after that, sales of the clothes far outstripped sales of the climbing gear. This is how Yvon Chouinard became an accidental apparel mogul. This truly hit home when fashion models in New York City started wearing Patagonia fleece vests. He had no idea why, and didn't really care. But he realized his life had changed.

Universities have speakers' budgets, which can offset the cost of travel, but because publishers' publicity departments and academic committees work on vastly different schedules, they haven't collaborated much.

About a third of the inmates sent to the mansion were returned to prison because of rules violations or infractions, but most worked there successfully during my terms. All but one of these mansion trusties had been convicted of murder.

However, we rarely read or hear about anyone going to prison for fraud. Could it be that their actions are/were legal? That the regulators looked the other way or perhaps there were no regulations? In today's world, where honesty and integrity are words found only in an old and obsolete dictionary, what is the incentive for the banks or any lending institution, to conduct business honestly if there are no personal penalties? If the only 'penalty' that the bank or lender has to worry about is writing a check, then all they need worry about is a 'paper' loss.

St. Louis Rams: They ended up with five of the top 65 choices, and all of them (DT Michael Brockers, WR Brian Quick, CB Janoris Jenkins, RB Isaiah Pead, CB Trumaine Johnson) could develop into core players, and yet each has serious questions too. We would've liked to have seen a better mix of apparent "can't-miss" talent (Claiborne or WR Justin Blackmon) coupled with the projects. But all that aside, kudos to the Rams for the pre-draft trade out of the No. 2 slot, one that still leaves them holding two future first rounders courtesy of Washington.

"Whoaa," said a bespectacled boy as we approached rye bread loaves covered with greenish-blue mold — penicillium Roqueforti — which occurs naturally in the caves.
