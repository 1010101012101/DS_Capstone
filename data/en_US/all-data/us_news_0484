We all have times in our lives when we are truly not on the right path, when we need to choose to turn around or turn away and realign ourselves with God's greater purpose for us. And there are also times in our lives when we see that someone else is heading the wrong way, a way that will surely lead to heartbreak and disaster, and we need to stop looking away, stop avoiding and pretending and looking around hoping that someone else will step in, and we need to be the one to say something, to do something, to offer a word of warning and direction. It's not easy being that person, either the one giving the warning or the one receiving it. It's not easy, but it is part of what it means to be a member of a community, including the community of the church.

As a suction-dredge gold miner, I strongly disagree with the April 11 opinion column, "Ending in-stream mining: We have the chance to protect the Chetco River." The authors tell how government plans to close off much of the Chetco River to mineral exploration, but they ignore scientific studies.

I live in the Pigtown neighborhood of Baltimore. When my suburban friends come visit, they hold their kids close, and they look askance at some of my more "unusual" neighbors. Some of them are only too happy to hop back in their cars and scurry back to the counties.

There are a few dolphin studies out there, but they don't add up to much, says Lori Marino, a neuroscience and behavioral biology researcher at Emory University in Atlanta. Japanese researchers published a small study in 2001 suggesting that dolphin therapy can somehow treat eczema, but that finding stretches credulity, Marino says. Another study that year from Australian researchers concluded that swimming with dolphins could improve feelings of well-being while reducing anxiety, but the findings were based on questionnaires given to 168 healthy people who had paid for their adventures, which predisposed them to see the investment as worthwhile. A more plausible study published in the British Medical Journal in 2005 found that dolphin therapy relieved depression symptoms for a group of 13 adults. Marino critiqued these and other studies in a review article published in 2007 in the journal Anthrozoos.

A: The role that I personally play and that the institute plays in giving back is rooted in a passion to find cures for those suffering from illness. It is embodied in our slogan: "The power to cure." Certainly, many of us try to give back in other ways. I'm pretty involved with the International Bipolar Foundation, which my wife started. We have a son with bipolar disorder, so that's something we have become very passionate about as well as removing the stigma from mental illness. Also, we offer internships in our laboratory as auction items at fundraising events for organizations such as the American Cancer Society or the Princess Margaret School. It's a way of not only raising money, but also giving a young, bright student an opportunity to get exposed to the world of medical research. I'm also on the board for a couple nonprofits that are very much involved in entrepreneurship and in helping to increase opportunities to create new companies and foster job growth in San Diego, such as BIOCOM, CONNECT and the California Healthcare Institute.

This island specialty lives in the same family as iced coffee but is way more delectable than anything by the same name served at Starbucks.

That Penn State police were aware of a report of abuse by Sandusky in 1998. The matter was referred to the district attorney, who declined to prosecute. Four years later, McQueary reported what he saw in the showers to the vice president in charge of campus police -- a man who was in the loop on the claim just four years before. McQueary's report should have sounded the alarm bells and led to a full investigation. It didn't. Instead, six more years passed, and it wasn't an adult who sounded the alarm. It was a young man who reported being victimized.

History suggests that teams who select a quarterback No. 1 overall tend to follow up with receivers, offensive linemen and running backs -- toys for the quarterback. In Bill Polian's first Colts draft, he chose Manning, wide receiver Jerome Pathon, wide receiver E.G. Green and guard Steve McKinney. Grigson, though, said there's no template for him. If the best available player is a wide receiver, he'll take him. If he's a linebacker, he'll take him.

The only statistics that you quoted were from the Violence Policy Center, an anti-gun group. Those statistics, nationwide — 11 law enforcement officers killed and 30 murder-suicides — in a two-year period by people permitted to carry concealed guns should have embarrassed you. Was a crime being committed when the law enforcement officers were killed? Did all these events take place on the streets with a concealed weapon?

The sharpest chapter is on Los Angeles: It explores how fires and mudslides visit more frequently than do destructive temblors, and how a confluence of such events in the early 1990s was seized on by detractors as proof of nature's wrath. But then the economy rebounded, the jitters of memory ceased and people headed back to the sunny southland. Because we don't ignore danger; we just fold it into the equation of what and where we want to be.
In building the health insurance plans, Treasury officials anticipate using a new federal Employee Group Waiver plan to save around $90 million in the state’s obligation for retiree prescriptions.

3. Riding in large groups: This doesn't apply to the increasingly popular bicycle pub crawls or tweed rides, which are generally low-speed affairs. But riding in large groups at full speed when you don't make your living that way is a recipe for disaster. Commenting on the 190-rider pack during the Stage 5 on the cable network Versus, Phil Liggett said, "One mistake by one rider and everyone is sliding 100 meters on the floor." Group riding is part of cycling at the highest levels, and drafting is the art and science of going faster while conserving energy. But riding in large groups can lead to mishaps  merely touching your front wheel to the rear wheel of the rider in front of you is enough to make you hit the deck. What's more, in the real world large groups are unwieldy. They stress out motorists and make it difficult to pass. Smaller, more manageable groups work better and show courtesy to others.

Motherhood may be the world's most complicated job, but when a child has autism and a host of other developmental disorders, the challenges are even tougher. With "Next Stop" (Putnam/Aimy Einhorn Books, 288 pages, $25.95), Glen Finland has written a memoir of wonderful insight and emotional honesty about her fearsome love for her autistic son, David, who seeks to move from adolescence into adulthood in a world that doesn't always understand the differently abled.

Unquestionably, George Zimmerman could not have been granted a permit by the Maryland State Police and would not be permitted legally to carry a weapon on our streets. In Maryland, Trayvon Martin would be alive today. Under our handgun statute in effect for 40 years, Mr. Zimmerman's prior brushes with the law would disqualify him from receiving a permit, as exhibiting a "propensity to violence and instability." And his participation in a neighborhood watch program would not in Maryland constitute a "good and substantial reason to wear, carry or transport" a weapon outside his home.

Another chunk went to replacing floors warped by a flooded toilet. The family also put wood floors in the garage in an ill-fated attempt to convert it to a playroom. The Okvaths discovered later there was no way to install the additional AC needed because they had maxed out the home's electrical capacity.
* The third one is a plank. The body is supported on the forearms and the toes, and you should try to keep the hips and the shoulders at the same height.

Do these about two to three times and hold for about 15 seconds. To modify this, drop down to your knees, but watch the hip position and avoid bending the body at the hips. You should still feel the extension in the hip flexors.
