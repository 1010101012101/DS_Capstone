How quickly a carefully constructed life can unravel! Henry, at 58, is neat, polite, consistent and self-contained. He has just retired from the company that bears his name. He lives alone in London in the house he shared with his ex-wife, Nessa, who left him for a British soap star. (Henry would not take her back when the affair crumbled.) His estranged son reenters his life when it becomes clear that Nessa is dying of cancer. And then, one lonely New Year's Eve, Henry is attacked by a violent man. Once a leader, once in control of his life, Henry becomes a victim. He's also stalked, harassed and humiliated in a café when he is caught eyeing a young woman. All these events threaten to drag our basically likable protagonist into permanent despair, or worse. David Abbott weaves new characters into the plot so that a reader isn't sure who will deliver the next blow to Henry's integrity. And then comes a truly crushing blow: Henry's responsibility for his beloved grandson's death. It is a dizzying downward spiral; Abbott has peered over the edge to write this gripping novel, a reminder of how little control we have over our lives.

The dead man was dressed in sweatpants, a tight-fitting thermal sweater and socks, but no shoes. Mazranni had seen the photographs of the men still missing and believed he’d found Fuzzy’s brother, Bernie. Using ropes, the divers pulled the body from the wreck and, while still underwater, placed it in a body bag, then lifted it to the surface.

This "Bohème" is a semi-staged production. (Segerstrom Concert Hall was designed without the theatrical apparatus necessary for a full production, which would be costly, at any rate.)

KTRS management predicted the move would vault the station, which was 16th in St. Louis market share the spring before it got baseball, to No. 1. But although KTRS improved significantly in the first spring it had baseball, it reached only No. 5 as KMOX remained at the top in the Arbitron survey. KTRS' under-performance was underscored in that fall's ratings period. Even though the Cards won the World Series in their first year at KTRS, which carried all the postseason games, KMOX had more than twice the market share of KTRS that fall.
"I feel like I'll adjust to help the team win," Roy said. "If the adjustment is going inside and playing off that, then I'm perfectly fine with that. My goal has always been to help this team win. I'm going to do whatever I can to help this team win."
Finally, the justice makes the case that some prisoners were sentenced to the death penalty before life without parole was available, and that if the life-without-parole sentence had been available, they might not have been given the death penalty. These prisoners were sentenced in accordance with the law in effect on the day they committed their offenses. That is the law under which they took the risk. But even if we wished to address this issue, Justice Pfeifer doesn't offer an alternative, other than to simply abolish the death penalty across the board. He appears to be in such a rush to get rid of the death penalty that he doesn't even pause to consider whether there might be another way to address this issue.

The two finalists were 1840s Ballroom and American Visionary Arts Museum. Both stunning in their own right but also innately different. As the name conveys, 1840s Ballroom is plush with old school charm, rich color palates and massive chandelier-clad ceilings. In addition to having our pick of three very distinct ballrooms, we were giving the option of using either of their two courtyards. AVAM, on the other hand, offers a more contemporary atmosphere surrounded by an array of the most inimitable artwork you have ever seen.

But even with this injury history, Oden's combination of power, athleticism and raw potential -- in a fearsome 7-foot, 275-pound body -- make him a rare and highly coveted player in a league that lacks a surplus of talented centers. And during the brief spells in which he has been healthy, Oden has revealed hints of dominance. In the second-to-last game he played for the Blazers against Miami, Oden finished with 13 points, 20 rebounds and four blocks; he also had a 24-point, 12-rebound performance against Chicago that same season.

TUESDAY IS another of those pesky half-holidays, with some things open, other things closed and everybody confused and/or uninterested. Now it's called Veterans Day, but when Nov. 11 was Armistice Day, it had meaning and poignancy - parades at slow time, muffled drums, black armbands, gold stars in the front windows of grieving mothers. The Civil War was a horror, but World War I was the real thing, dragging this coltish young nation into the international arena. It was all so innocent that those of our generation cannot hear "My Buddy" or "Over There" without a lump in the throat. I won't say "Happy Veterans Day" because the phrase makes no sense.

Of course, Mr. Mooney believes he's simply going where the science leads. Consider that one of the more famous studies was conducted by liberal researchers at University of California-Los Angeles and New York University and published in Nature Neuroscience. Subjects were asked to spot the letters M or W on a screen for a fraction of a second. It turns out that self-described liberals did somewhat better on the test than the conservatives.

I like to use peanut butter because it can be frozen. A Kong filled with frozen peanut butter will keep most dogs busy for up to an hour, sometimes more.

Bullet trains fit into at least two of those categories aside from high-speed rail itself -- traffic reduction and passenger rail. So the money for repaying the bonds is already there if future Legislatures and governors choose to spend it on this.

Here's what's different between Ohio and Pennsylvania, at least philosophically: State officials in Pennsylvania aren't actively seeking companies to drill on public land, as will soon be the case in Ohio. In Pennsylvania, the state doesn't own the mineral rights below much of its parkland and so it may not legally be able to keep drillers out.

My steak, a 26-ounce bone-in rib-eye dry-aged for 36 days ($58) was a rare exception to my complaint about oversalting.

Mahilum, a 50-year-old petite Philippine native with a big laugh and a stylish flair, is cancer-free. But life for the Bloomfield resident still isn’t really normal.

Next, I shall surprise you by citing as a favorable factor the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, which with various affiliated organizations pretty much controls the commercial development of the region. It seems to me that the economic situation out here has forced it, perhaps unconsciously, to acquire a profounder notion of its responsibilities than you will find in most organizations of its kind. The average American chamber of commerce, in my experience with it, is a noisy, tiresome, and exceedingly childish booster affair, with no maturer idea of its function than to bring as many factories'to town as possible, in order that merchants will have more customers, realtors more prospects for their lots, and property more benefit from the unearned increment. That, and a running wrangle with the Interstate Commerce Commission, carried on by the traffic department, over some freight differential enjoyed by a nearby city, is about the extent of its activity. As to whether the factories are desirable, as to whether abolishment of the differential would throw several railroads into bankruptcy, they seldom give a thought; and sometimes, as when one Eastern city proudly announced the advent of a soap factory that had stunk so badly it was run out of another city, you wonder whether they are quite bright.

At the state level, Norquistism has not been quite as successful, but much effort has gone into constitutional initiatives designed to require super-majorities for tax increases. The fruits of these are seen in California's fiscal crisis, which finds its roots in the repudiation by "liberals" and "conservatives" alike of both respect for localism and respect for majority rule. As Professor William Fischel of Dartmouth has demonstrated, the great "liberal" victory in Serrano v. Priest, mandating equal educational spending, led inexorably to Proposition 13's restrictions on local taxes, the depletion of the state fisc with the aid of tax limitations, and the ruin of California's once-distinguished school and college systems

On the other main issue remaining, giving schools chief Eric Gordon broad powers to change failing schools and their staffs, the Partnership and union polls had different slants on the question and show very different results.

These first years of the millennium have been extraordinarily trying, especially for a nation that had passed a quarter century in relative peace. Then came terror. Then came wars. Then came economic meltdown.

From such bubble gum-snapping we bounce to patches of coolly direct prose, such as in his measured retelling of his time on a road cleanup crew, a fine piece of writing. Or to insightful music criticism, like this on Roxy Music's "More Than This": "I've loved this song since the first moment I heard it, yet I really have no idea who the girl is he's singing to or what she's like. I guess this is a song about desire so complete, it doesn't even need an actual girl in it. He is beyond such details. If she won't accept his love, he'll have to adore it himself. The end of the song is just Bryan Ferry murmuring the words 'more than this' and 'nothing,' so that every time, they describe a new shade of blue. Gatsby would have understood."

At a more significant level, on most trips, your best opportunity to pay less and still retain the experience is when you arrange hotel accommodations. Hotel prices in many big U.S. and foreign cities these days range from outrageous to out of sight. As I've often noted, the best way to fight high hotel prices is to book through an opaque site. Travelocity and Quikbook have joined Hotwire and Priceline, the two originators of the concept. Lately, I almost always book that way, and I've never encountered a problem. Also, for really upscale properties, sign up for such "private sale" operations as Sniqueaway (www.sniqueaway.com) and JetSetter (www.jetsetter.com).

While not as robust as last year’s count, which was a biannual survey required by the federal government, the "point-in-time" look at the state’s homeless population will offer a snapshot of how the poorest among us are living.
