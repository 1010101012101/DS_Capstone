What happened on that awful date was a bomb attack targeted at Karachi's annual Shia procession, a locus of friction for the city's, and Pakistan's, ongoing sectarian religious conflicts.

Hey, Tom: Anthony Davis is the clear No. 1 pick in this year's draft class. If the Cavs were to luck into the first pick again, how do you see them incorporating him into the lineup? Do they play him at the 4 and keep Thompson as an eternal backup, or do they try to play him at the 3? Would they trade Thompson if they got that pick? Would they look to trade back slightly and pick up a player/extra pick? -- J Smith, Rocky River

Depends on whether they think the big contracts Hendry gave out are outweighed by the development of kids like Castro and Barney, and, for a while, Cashner and Colvin. I can't read the Rickettses' minds, but I do know they respect and like Hendry. It'll be interesting to see what happens if they don't at least get over .500. I still think the Cubs can be competitive, since they usually beat themselves and are rarely blown out of games. This will be a big homestand for them.

It's more instinctive now."

Artist's Drive near sunset expands my Death Valley color wheel to a surprising wealth of pastels, especially around Artist's Palette. The drive along the one-way, nine-mile loop through this area of extreme volcanic activity flows like an amusement-park ride with dips, dives and S-shaped curves. I take advantage of numerous pullouts to stop and aim my camera at ravines and rock formations where volcanic deposits light up into an array of muted pink, lavender and turquoise.
I'm not suggesting this was entirely your fault. Online booking systems can be confusing. It's easy to select the wrong date on most websites. The pull-down menus don't behave in exactly the same way from Web browser to Web browser, so you can think you've selected December when, in fact, you've clicked September.

This career allows me to do meaningful work. I find it so rewarding to watch children - my specialty is kindergarten through fifth graders - grow into their own understanding of their learning differences at an age appropriate level. I love teaching them how to advocate for themselves and giving them the tools needed to overcome their learning difficulties; I have the privilege of watching them evolve from a defeatist attitude to believing in themselves and their abilities.

Just make sure your white-meat burgers are made from skinless breast meat. For instance, if the label just says "ground turkey," it probably includes dark meat and skin.

Second, I want to make it clear that this was not an easy Report to write, and it will not be easy to discuss today. Both Mr. Egelhof and I have spent a considerable amount of time during our careers working with state, federal and local law enforcement officers. I worked with law enforcement officers on a daily basis for 7 years as a federal prosecutor in New York and Minnesota, and I was always proud to be associated with the extraordinary public servants I worked beside during my time in the US Attorney’s office. And Mr. Egelhof spent over two decades working for the F.B.I. and believes in the mission of law enforcement. We both have the greatest respect for the work that law enforcement officers do. And we admire the risks they take every day for the benefit of all of us. Moreover, both Mr. Egelhof and I understand the need for aggressive law enforcement action and we have experienced first hand how properly conducted aggressive investigations can save lives and benefit the public.
The chow: Sandwich options include a riff on a Philly cheesesteak sandwich ($5.50) made of homemade seitan (a high-protein meat substitute made of wheat gluten) that's grilled with onions and green peppers, then stuffed into a hoagie roll with either Tillamook cheddar or vegan cheese. There's also an insanely large "chicken" salad sub, made of soy curls, celery and diced red onions. For the traditionalist who has given up eating beef, there's the terrific burger ($4), made with a homemade veggie patty that's topped with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pickles on a toasted bun. To really dress it up, add vegan cheese and tempeh bacon for a $1.75 add-on.

And this game was a good one because, with Harvard coming in, the crowd was a near-capacity of 7,000. I got there about 45 minutes early to pick up our tickets (I went with Bob Ramsey and Earl Austin Jr.) and the line had about 20 people in it. By the time Bob and Earl got there about 10 minutes before the game, the line stretched for a block. For the first half, we sat in our assigned seats, which were in a corner about 8 rows up in the second level, amid Penn students. Most of the seating at the Palestra is bleachers, so people get wedged in tight. For the second, we decided to move higher in the stands to one of the few unoccupied sections where we had a wide view of the court and more room to stretch out and talk. Again, it was a great experience, and I'm glad I went.
Christie does leave New Jersey as his political luck seems to have stalled, however. As Christie is traipsing around the United States, Democrats back home continue pounding away at the loss of $400 million in federal education aid caused by a mistake on an application filed by the Christie admininstration. In the wake of the blunder, the governor fired his education commissioner and is now contending with public hearings and investigations led by his opponents in the Democratic Party, who control the Legislature.

During the last decade, each evolution in the understanding of the best process for harvesting premium grapes for Napa's sought-after wines has meant more workers in the field and more hands gently moving the fruit from the vine to the fermenter.

Some will argue that Iran is more dangerous than North Korea. While in some ways that's true, Iran is arguably more calculating. North Korea has made several unprovoked attacks on South Korea, such as the strike against the frigate Cheonan in 2010. Yet because of agreed international policies, Pyongyang still does not have enough fissile material to test adequately whether its nuclear-armed warheads could survive missile flight and atmospheric re-entry.

She has found a kindred spirit in her boyfriend, Patrick Crowley. The last time Mr. Crowley bought a new phone five years ago, he told the salesman, "I want a phone that you could drop-kick into a lake and go get it and still be able to make a call." Mr. Crowley, 32, a hydrologist and co-founder of Chapul Inc., a health-food start-up, got a Casio G'zOne, then replaced it with an old, used model off Craigslist two years ago. He uses it only to make calls—and occasionally as a flashlight. When he comes home, he and Erica "don't want to be looking at our phones," he says. "We want to be cooking together and having face-to-face conversations."

The elixir from the world's only known edible orchid, probably first cultivated by the Totonaca in neighboring Veracruz state, had become a common flavoring for the Maya's chocolate drinks by the 1500s. Vanilla, too, was adopted by the Aztecs, who introduced it to Cortés. Spanish and Portuguese explorers who brought it to Africa and Asia in the 16th century named it vainilla, or "little pod." Southern Mexico's jungle is still the only place the Vanilla planifolia orchid grows wild, pollinated by native, non-stinging bees that produce Maya honey. Today's prized Tahitian vanilla, which came from Mexican stock, requires hand-pollination.

Both pies have the same dual-personality dough: a perfect, flaky golden outside with a mushy inside.

#8 Say no to the insurance con. Rental car insurance is a weak spot for most travelers. Even those who’ve been very smart airline-wise and hotel-wise often cave in and buy the over-the-counter insurance that rental car companies aggressively push on customers. A simple rule — check your existing policy and your credit card policies and make sure that you’re covered. If there’s any potential for trouble, get an American Express card (if you don’t already have one) and sign up for their Premium Car Rental Protection service. The cost is $24.95 per rental period — less than it costs to get the daily insurance bundle in many states — and it gives you a heap of coverage it should be mentioned) with no deductibles. Essentially, this is the perfect product for a car insurance-less New Yorker. (Note: Liability not included.)

I think he'll be the Cards' best closer since Jason Isringhausen.

Alternative libations: If none of the cocktails on the menu appeals to you, ask your friendly mixologist whether he has created a brew of his own. Andrew Parrish, for instance, dreamed up the "Lava Lamp" for all those looking for a little psychedelic trip. Parrish combines raspberry vodka, triple sec, a splash of orange juice and fresh raspberries, then shakes up the beverage so hard that the floating raspberries resemble the pulsing lava. Eric Wong's "Wong Island" has freshly muddled raspberries with a mix of Absolut Mandarin and Malibu rum, orange juice and pineapple juice, with a splash of Sprite.

Where things went seriously off the rails was with a floor amendment adopted on Wednesday that would create a new super-bracket for those who make more than $500,000 a year. The original plan would have raised the rate for that bracket to 5.75 percent. But the amendment called for that rate to apply to a taxpayer's entire income, not just earnings above that amount.

2007 Inniskillin Gold Niagara Peninsula Vidal Icewine ($65/375 ml, 10%): Inniskillin has made a name for Canadian wine in the most unlikely way - with the hybrid Vidal grape hanging well into Ontario's frigid winter until the grapes dehydrate from freezing. (This was harvested in January 2008.) The oak-aged Gold '07 is steely up front, with Vidal's slightly wild aromas on display. Unique key lime aromas round out roasted walnut, caramel and peach cobbler. The syrup-like texture is matched by almost outrageous acidity. Ready for 15 years or more of improvement.

Washington's offense found its rhythm late in the second quarter, as quarterback Keith Price guided the Huskies on a 12-play, 49-yard march that ate up 5 minutes and 50 seconds.

50. Kellen Winslow, Jr., TE, 2004, 1/6, Miami (Fla.), 2004-08. Missed 36 of 80 games, many due to the after-effects of his motorcyle accident after the 2005 season. His passion was often offset by his complaining. Brilliant pass-catcher but blocking was affected by four knee surgeries. Made 2007 Pro Bowl team. Winslow's talent level enabled the Browns to acquire second- and fifth-round picks for him in a trade with Tampa Bay.

Wrapup: Best shooter? Matt "auto-Matt-ic" Jones, a 6-4 junior guard from Texas has a funny looking stroke, but there is no denying it is going in . . . On the Block? Below the rim, no question it's Indiana's 6-11 Mitch McGary. He won't wow you with dunks, but everything else he can do. Above the rim? That's 7-1 Willie Cauley from Kansas. Best all-around? That's 6-11 Daniel Ochefu from Pennsylvania. Gets more than his share of dunks, but nice post-ups and defensively intimidates. Floor general? Spindly Marcus Paige from Iowa will need to bulk up considerably when he gets to North Carolina, but no question he's a playmaker on the court.
Motorists in a right-turning lane -- curb or otherwise -- can go on red unless a sign prohibits the move, according to the Ohio Department of Transportation. Since no don't-do-it notice exists at the I-271 exit onto Wilson Mills, it's OK to do it. (Road Rant checked with the Highland Heights police, too, and they gave their blessing.)
They've supposedly been negotiating with former Indians' infielder Brandon Phillips longer and less successfully than they negotiated Votto's deal. Votto, for good reason, took precedence.

Moses is the hip-hop artist Christina is trying to groom into an all-around entertainer. Supposedly, he came up with the choreography for his Kanye West "Stronger" and "Power" medley. Although this was a good performance, particularly the distracting dancers who were flipping like Chris Brown was calling them back to the Grammys stage, I don't share Christina's fervent belief that Moses can do it all, unless by "all" she means making a Kanye song unrecognizable. Music may have kept this former crack user off the street but I predict that music, if made like this, will put him back there looking for work.

Gov. Chris Christie has said judges traditionally have paid the least amount of money into their pension program yet they receive some of the highest payouts. Case law allows judges in New Jersey to hear cases that affect them when there is no other court that has jurisdiction over the matter. The case hasn’t gone to federal court because DePascale’s allegations involve the state — not federal — constitution.
We arrived at the hotel in the early evening and opted to sit at the bar. I was surprised by the tiny, L-shaped bar, capable of seating six people at most. The majority of seating indoors is in the form of restaurant tables, and there's a large courtyard out front with a view of Beach Drive, as well as another to the side, which features a fireplace on cooler nights. A second bar and large, separate courtyard are occasionally open for private parties or busy nights.

Every game is important. To get one of the top four seeds, the Blues will have to win the vast majority of their remaining games. Given the nature of the schedule – lots of road games, lots of games against the NHL elite – that won't be easy. Momentum is a great thing this time of year. Teams that lose it can suddenly feel the wear and tear of the 82-game marathon in their legs. The Blues are especially vulnerable to a lull given all their injuries and the relative inexperience of many of their key players.
She also noted that the council at her recommendation did retain paying unlimited utility tax rebates to senior citizens "who really need it" - those meeting a low-income standard.

Iran would then use the Indian currency to buy goods from India.

Siebert doesn't keep up with politics, but he doesn't need to read government documents to know his home isn't what it used to be.
