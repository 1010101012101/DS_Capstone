Now retired, Stokes said he decided to speak about Jackson's plan after hearing the mayor talk recently and being impressed with his sincerity about wanting to improve the schools.
But not so fast. Details of the symbiotic relationship between TABOR and the 1982 statewide Gallagher Amendment must be considered. Gallagher mandates a ratio of 55 percent commercial property tax to 45 percent residential. When TABOR passed in 1992, unintended consequences erupted. TABOR sets strict limits on how much revenue taxing authorities can keep without voter approval. Revenue in excess of inflation plus population growth must be refunded. Because Denver has not de-Bruced property tax, 6.2 mills per year are refunded to every taxpayer.
In another setback for the job market, new unemployment claims unexpectedly jumped last week, the government reported early Thursday.

For those eager to travel the musical landscape elsewhere, consider this a bucket list, a go-and-do of highlights in the U.S. and around the world:
A great eye shadow can turn a sweet, soft look into a sexy, sultry one, and Iman knocked this task out of the park! I tested the colors Vixen and Wicked, and found them to be easy to apply, long-lasting, eye-defining powders that burst with color and add a subtle glow to any finished look. Although Iman offers only a limited variety of color choices, each are neutral enough to match any skin color to create and complete a great look. Without a doubt, I'm the newest and biggest fan!
A former NFL quarterback, Harbaugh worked wonders with Alex Smith in a matter of months for the NFC West champions, and now all signs point to the 49ers being a serious player in the Manning sweepstakes. Smith, who had a three-year offer on the table to return, traveled to Miami on Sunday to meet with the Dolphins.
Williams' theme song has been part of "MNF" since 1989. The song was a version of his hit "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight" that he altered to match each week's game. He owns the song and all the rights to it, so ESPN will not be able to use it in any way.
1. There is no substitute for independent judgment. This is something my husband always says, and boy did it ring true in this experience. I was shocked by the amount of double mastectomy peer pressure I received! It seemed like every woman I know who has been through this, and even some of my doctors, were telling me to "just get rid of both of them."
The break allows AIG to count its past net operating losses against future taxes. That amounts to a "stealth bailout" of a company that received about $125 billion in taxpayer money, said the former appointees to the Congressional Oversight Panel for the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program.
Then there is Gingrich, the former U.S. House speaker who, despite being far back in recent polls, is paying just enough attention to Ohio to cut into the conservative vote Santorum would prefer to have to himself. Gingrich spent all week campaigning elsewhere, mainly Georgia, one of his home states and the state awarding the most delegates on Super Tuesday. Polls show Gingrich ahead there, but a loss would be embarrassing and most certainly force him from the race.
His schedule will remain busy.
But all the fuss and fundraising is really about economic grit: Supporting small businesses within the market's walls, spurring more growth in a quick-changing neighborhood, and finding the right strategy - and funding sources - to sustain a cultural and culinary hub.

D Geoff Cameron, Houston Dynamo: With L.A's Omar Gonzalez sidelined, the 26-year-old very well may be the best American central defender in MLS. He's imposing, good with the ball and has caught U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann's eye.
And that's the fundamental flaw in Robert Lepage's staging of Wagner's "Ring" cycle, which is closing out the Metropolitan Opera's season with three complete performances.

After the Rangers held an optional practice before hopping a train to Washington for Games 3 and 4 of the series, Tortorella was asked why he takes an adversarial approach with reporters who continue to prod him for information.
This time, the total came to $3,213.
Perhaps the move by the 49ers has something to do with their heartbreaking 20-17 overtime loss to New York in the NFC championship game. After all, they went out and snatched Manningham, who had a 17-yard touchdown reception in that game. Subtract those six points from one side and add them to the other and you've got another team representing the NFC at the Super Bowl.
BEST MOMENT: The battle on the ships. I liked this part the best because it was an old-fashioned, action-packed, sword-fighting scene.

Notes: Oregon coach Vin Lananna said the Ducks will send a 10-athlete contingent to Seattle Saturday for the UW Final Qualifier to attempt to qualify for next week’s NCAA Indoor Championships. Among the Ducks competing will be long jumper Jamesha Youngblood and sprinter Mike Berry. Lananna said the UO coaches caught Berry’s 400-meter split in Oregon’s distance medley relay last week in 46.0 seconds. .¤.¤. It sounds as if the Ducks are putting together an assault on the collegiate record in the 4xmile relay, possibly at the Oregon Twilight on May 6 at Hayward Field. The Ducks set the record of 16:03.24 in 2009 with a team of Matthew Centrowitz, Andrew Wheating, Shadrack Biwott and Rupp. Salazar said Wednesday he and discussed the possibility of entering an Oregon Project 4xmile team to make it a race. .¤.¤.

In other words, while investment bank and professional forecasters are predicting a slow and steady depreciation of the dollar over the next year, a sharp move in the dollar might push the system over a tipping point so that a much more discontinuous decline occurs. If market participants are myopic, that provides yet another scenario for a big drop. On the other hand, this precarious balancing act of the dollar has proven far more durable than many observers had believed possible, and so may survive this challenge.
Four years ago I placed a dog that had some severe fear and anxiety issues with a wonderful family. They saw him online and decided he was the dog for them. I made them jump through quite a few hoops to ensure they were right for one another (although not mentioned in the poll story, many rescue groups' insistence that people go through some type of vetting process before adopting may be a reason some shy away from adoption), and they did so, gladly. Today Frosty has the best home with the best people. He has come a long way from the dog we had to coax from the bushes where we found him.
Bing did a lot more talking Wednesday night about what he has done and what he will do to put Detroit on a right path.

Kuti, who performs Wednesday at UC San Diego's Price Center Ballroom, was indeed great. Exuding the same charisma as his legendary musician father, the late Fela Kuti, he and his band laid down a series of syncopated grooves that had the appreciative audience gyrating from start to finish. He easily lived up to the name of one of his songs, "Giant of Africa," while also providing listeners with a welcome opportunity to experience some of the music that helped lay the foundation for American funk and hip-hop.
This continued a trend from Saturday's postgame, when Thomas was more quotable than usual, telling us "there ain't no competition at my position." I asked Darron today if he's amused or puzzled by some of the media and fan base writing and talking about a quarterback controversy and he nodded emphatically.

He and Chiampou have little sympathy for the sob stories about seniors who will no longer receive visits from Meals on Wheels, or cuts to preschool programs that could force some working mothers onto welfare.

A more striking 400-foot tower with an observation deck could be added to the existing memorial, making it more visible from a distance, especially with special lighting at night. Perhaps an architect could offer some pro bono work on design and costs and the community could create a better monument for our soldiers.

The unfortunate thing is that Braxton Miller was better than he had ever been until he was hurt. But even at that, his carelessness with the ball started Nebraka's comeback when he was stripped at his own 23 in the third quarter, with Ohio State ahead, 27-6.

Still, spread out over a 24-hour period, ODOT traffic analyst Simon Eng said he doesn't see how commuters would notice such a "statistically insignificant" increase.
“I think we’re playing tough in our own way," Elias responded. "We don’t give them much room or much pace. We have guys coming back. We’re trying to outnumber them defensively.

Kim D. is trying to reign in Teresa, and Ashley seizes the moment. As Kim G. tries to escort Danielle to the car, Ashley sashays over and yanks some of Danielle's hair extensions out. "Who do you think you are?" Ashley says, delivering her lines with the bare minimum of emotion. (She should hire Gia's acting coach.) As Jacqueline pulls her away, Ashley yells, "Love and light. Stay in the positive, bitch." The bodyguard scoops up Danielle and takes her Kim G.'s Bentley. Jacqueline is upset when she hears that Ashley pulled Danielle's hair: "Oh, great. Why did it have to get to this point." BECAUSE YOU'RE ON A REALITY SHOW, IDIOT WOMAN.

This is a lovely, lush, tasty monster of a kitten for the Pinot lover. 88 points.
Brown also lets us know that at 5-foot-6 he's a textbook over-compensator: He married Diana (Synnove Macody Lund), a classic Nordic blond who towers over him, and to keep her happy he needs more money than he can easily make.

In the eastern Canadian Arctic, the narwhal's future is just as uncertain. Long a source of fascination, Europeans once thought that the creature's long spiral tooth protruding from the front of its head was like the horn of the unicorn. Instead, scientists discovered that the tooth is an extraordinary sensor for temperature, salinity and other ocean conditions and may help with navigation and feeding. Today, up to 60,000 narwhal, or 85 percent of the world's population, migrate in summer through Lancaster Sound, at the eastern entrance to the Northwest Passage. They spend winters feeding on Greenland halibut more than a kilometer below the surface of Baffin Bay.

My younger son Ian is 8 and the idea of him in handcuffs, sitting in a jail cell somewhere, makes me sick to my stomach. But the idea of him threatening someone’s life by saying he’s going to hold their head underwater and forcing a classmate onto some railroad tracks makes me equally if not more upset. I’d want him to learn a lesson he soon wouldn’t forget, because a lecture from mom and dad can only be so effective. However, it would have to be a coordinated effort between myself, school administrators, and local law enforcement.

Our favorite selection was an appetizer, dice-size chunks of mahi-mahi served in "lettuce cups." ($6.99). The fish was mixed with mango and avocado and other vegetables in a tropical fish salsa, with the greens of the lettuce adding a frame of color and texture for a vivid presentation. The term "cups" was a bit misdirected, as we needed a fork: They weren't really the kind of thing you could pick up and eat like a wrap.

Adding a third shift was a leap of faith that paid off for GM. That shift let the plant produce more than 26,000 vehicles in March, April, May and June. With the Chevy Cobalt, the Cruze's predecessor, the Lordstown plant rarely produced more than 20,000 vehicles a month. Last year, the plant had about 3,300 workers and it averaged fewer than 14,000 vehicles per month.

Hmmm ... I think Phillip could and should have sung "The Letter" more raunchier and down and dirtier. He certainly is capable of doing so. He rallied back with "Time of the Season" and did a very decent job. Is it his singing or his sex appeal to women that is keeping him alive on "Idol"? He won me over as a fan when he was among the top 13, but he's lost my interest and he's fallen into the valley of the mundane. Unlike some of the contestants who sometimes motivate some of my fellow judges to get the urge to get up off their seats to sing and dance along, Phillip's apoplectic facial and body contortions as he strains to reach high notes (face red, vein in his forehead bulging and eyes popping and looking askance) motivates me with a different kind of urge to get up off my seat and run to the bathroom. His attempt last week at trying to be different and artsy fartsy failed miserably. But he nevertheless helped my constipation.
Regarding the petition drive to suspend the law granting in-state tuition to illegal immigrants: At least the immigrants are trying to better themselves by getting an education that will lead to jobs so they can become self-supporting members of society.

If the accumulation of UV light is the chief risk factor for melanoma, how does this explain melanoma in a 10-year-old boy? Why does melanoma appear in areas that are rarely exposed to the sun? Why does melanoma appear as a black mole in one person and as a pink bump in another? The answer may lie in the genetic differences that can be shared and inherited among family members as well as genetic and molecular changes within the melanomas themselves that initiate and lead to their growth.
Her political fortunes dropped when she clashed with another of Mexico's most powerful women, Elba Esther Gordillo, a Calderon ally who controls a key voting bloc as head of the national teachers union. Calderon demanded Vazquez Mota's resign in 2009, a firing seen as humiliating.

Though the Anderson's dowdy in-fill house was in solid condition, it fell short of serving the family's active lifestyle and matching the neighborhood's early-20th century charm. So, the Andersons hired Larson and his wife and business partner, Jean Rehkamp Larson, to help answer a familiar, but increasingly perplexing question: Remodel or start shopping for a new house?

Year of the Quarterback in the NFL … not to mention the Year of the Tight End and the Year of the Next Generation at wide receiver. Of the 12 teams that made the playoffs, seven finished in the top 10 in total yards and points scored this season. But both the Raiders and Colts apparently have decided to buck the trend toward offense. Oakland, reportedly, is on the verge of hiring Denver defensive coordinator Dennis Allen as its head coach; the Colts have a Thursday news conference scheduled to announce the hiring of Ravens defensive coordinator Chuck Pagano. Maybe this is the influence of old-school Jim Harbaugh having so much success in his first year at San Francisco. Maybe it's the realization by a pair of franchises that they don't have the firepower to hang with the Packers and Patriots of the world. Whatever the reasoning behind Oakland and Indianapolis' moves, it's a clear signal that defense is far from dead in the NFL."

Originally, the printmakers used only India ink, but by the mid-19th century, prints were multicolored and often quite vibrant. Printmakers would sometimes dip the blocks in ink several times to bring out a fully saturated color. Those colors, intricate details and use of perspective give the small prints, which tend to be only about 9 inches by 16 inches, a great sense of depth.

Zach Randolph couldn't sleep, so he watched himself miss an easy layup late in Sunday night's 99-98 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on tape. He feels he had the worst playoff game of his career with six points and the memory of a badly missed short jumper where the ball sailed over the basket, never coming close.

Gridlock means that "their taxes aren't going to be raised," he said, and that "government programs aren't going to be expanded. Certainly most Americans would love to see real job creation, but to the extent that that takes federal dollars, there's very little appetite for it."

A GPS race tracking system indicated the Aegean disappeared about 1:30 a.m. PDT (4:30 a.m. EDT) Saturday, said Rich Roberts, a spokesman for the race organizer. Race organizers weren't closely monitoring the race at that hour but a disappearing signal is no cause for alarm because receivers occasionally suffer glitches, he said.
Nguyen said he is not bothered by the fits and starts, noting that Lala started as a CD-trading company before becoming an online music company. That service took several years to gain traction before attracting millions of users and eventually selling to Cupertino-based Apple.
As he builds strength and regains velocity, Wainwright has not been able to consistently get extension on his pitches, and that cost him on both pitches that resulted in homers Thursday. He stressed that he recognizes his stuff may be limited by his recovery, but not his ability to find another way to win.
Henry Abbott: Nicolas Batum is great, and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise. But is he the golden child? He has been treated as such ... he's the player the Blazers refused to put into trades. He's every GM's "guy they have their eye on." He's the one the team traded up for so the other smart teams, namely the Spurs, couldn't nab him. He's a long defender with some offensive spice and just the right amount of mean streak. (Remember when he helpfully reminded Pau Gasol how many times he had dunked on him?) With his length and ability, he has the potential to be a starter on an NBA championship team. But that would mean playoff series shutting down an elite scorer. That would mean great production on offense from few touches -- which is tough when you're making only 35 percent of your 3s. That would mean being the most intense player on the floor. And for my taste, he is too often the opposite. I love his potential, but can't wait to get past that phase, and into the part of his career with his about high PER and killer defensive highlights. He's valuable as hell, but still nowhere near what he could be.

Surrounded and inspired by nature, Sorich, 62, lives with his wife, Lisa Hedstrom, a textile artist, in a house the couple built high in the Los Altos hills, near Skylonda. The house and expansive workshop, like much of Sorich's art, make liberal use of recycled materials, and power is generated in part through solar panels and a windmill. Given the seclusion of the rustic property, it's no surprise that animals are a recurring motif in Sorich's whimsical fire pits and barbecues.

Because of the limited tax base, both communities function on shoestring budgets. Neale quotes her annual budget at $75,000, whereas Roskos says Timberlake's is around $450,000. Still, Lakeline's 226 residents and Timberlake's population of just over 750 require services similar to larger area cities. Both villages have developed creative solutions to deal with tight budgets.

But the latest downturn was too big to overcome. Weiss said he lost bank financing that allowed him to purchase merchandize to stock his stores. Over the past year, he was able to get loans from private lenders to keep the business going, but sales were dropping off too quickly. With high unemployment, fewer people are springing for expensive designer winter coats and accessories, Weiss said.

The bone fragment ended up in a box in the department's evidence room where it sat until earlier this year when another investigator reminded Wright about it. DNA testing on a bone that could have even belonged to an ancient inhabitant of the area would have been hugely expensive for his small department, a costly fishing expedition.

The idea for a trip began as the wistful thinking of a grieving mother. But a hospice social worker whispered it to the Elves of Christmas Present. Maybe the grassroots, volunteer group could provide some gas money and perhaps a hotel stay? Nothing too big, just a trip to see the ocean, she asked.
With Luck and Griffin at the top of the board, Denver Post draft insider Jeff Legwold sifted through video, interviewed general managers, coaches and scouts, and attended the Senior Bowl and the scouting combine to put together the top 100 players of this year's draft, regardless of position. Players are ranked not only on the basis of their college production but on their pro potential.
I found that the owners of Grayl's Hotel, located in a historic building dating back to the 1920s, had decided to take a cue from the site's past and open an exclusive, and expensive, Prohibition Club harkening back to the Roaring Twenties, with multiple bars and lounges — including a themed speakeasy and rooftop "lookout" bar — a cigar and wine bar, a library and a dance floor among the list of amenities for members. Unfortunately, the economy took a dive, and most of the elaborate plans were nixed. Gatsby's Restaurant and Packard's Bar were the two projects that remained.

After an international conference on Afghanistan in The Hague this week, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton explained clearly why the country's progress cannot be separated from that of its women. "You cannot expect a country to develop if half its population are underfed, undereducated, under-cared for, oppressed and left on the sidelines," she said. "And we believe strongly that that's not in the interest of Afghanistan or any country."

The capacity of wind farms connected to the BPA's transmission network has ballooned from 250 megawatts in 2005 to more than 3,500 today and is expected to double again in the next two years. That outstrips demand growth in the region and is being driven in large part by California utilities, which are required to meet a third of their customers' electricity needs with renewables by 2020.
And then last fall, Young approached the Port of Portland, a quasi-public agency that had just approved a strategic plan to buy and develop more industrial land. She asked if it would consider LSI's property.
Three years ago, the school district proposed reassigning parts of Talega to a different San Clemente campus to ease crowding at Vista del Mar, especially at the elementary level. Furious Talega residents packed into district board meetings by the hundreds, insisting they all wanted to stay at Vista del Mar and that the campus was central to their community's identity. The school board heard those pleas – Talega was kept whole, even as other attendance boundaries in San Clemente were shifted.
Only taxes due as of last May are eligible, Testa said, because officials feared that since this program had to be approved last year by the General Assembly, then some people might not pay taxes due later last year or this year.

It’s a safe bet that KC’s downtown area has more live theater than you’re used to.
Notes: OSU was able to win going away despite being penalized 14 times for 120 yards. “We really put ourselves into some positions, didn’t we?’’ said Riley. … tailback Jordan Jenkins – who caught a 31-yard touchdown pass against the Cougars – may miss practice time this week because of concussion symptoms. … tight end Joe Halahuni tweaked an ankle but should be ready to practice on Tuesday, but center Grant Johnson (ankle) and outside linebacker Rueben Robinson (shin contusion) may miss time. … Riley is hopeful injured starting linebackers Feti Unga and Cameron Collins can play this week. “Right now, Cam is closer than Feti is,’’ said Riley of their recovery time. … tailback Jovan Stevenson (knee) is still questionable. Stevenson didn’t make the trip to Seattle, but OSU got good news on the tailback front when freshman Malcolm Agnew was able to gain 103 yards on 23 carries without re-injuring his hamstring. … Mannion has moved to to No. 2 in the conference, averaging 26 completions per game. He is right behind Arizona’s Nick Foles and ahead of USC’s Matt Barkley, Arizona State’s Brock Osweiler, and Stanford’s Andrew Luck. … Mannion, who has thrown for 1,964 yards and nine touchdowns, is on pace to throw for 3,364 yards. That would be the third-highest total in school history. The record is 3,615 yards in 2004 by Derek Anderson. … Utah has won three of its last four meetings with OSU, including an improbable 31-28 win at Salt Lake City in 2008. The Utes, down 28-20, scored 11 points in 90 seconds and won the game on Louie Sakoda’s 37-yard field goal as time expired. … Utah was helpless offensively at Cal, gaining just two first downs in the first half. Quarterback Jon Hayes threw three interceptions and fumbled once, and normally-reliable running back John White was limited to 39 yards on 15 carries a week after rushing for 171 yards in Utah’s win at Pitt. ... a noted BCS buster before it joined the Pac-12 this season, Utah hasn't lost four conference games in a row since 2002.

The poor are Appalachian coal miners who work without adequate safety protections. They are veterans who return victorious from wartime battlefields to face defeat in economic crossfires. The poor tend our children, mow our lawns. They clean up the hotel rooms that Romney and Gingrich sleep in. But the poor can't afford adequate health care, stable housing, or to send their kids to college.

But not every committee member was on board with raising athletic fees. School board member Barry Albertson suggested that the amount the district would save by cutting tennis, golf and water polo -- an estimated $36,000 -- is small enough that the district could find the funds from within to cover it.
Her personal story is no less compelling than her fierce competitiveness as a coach. Summitt learned to play basketball in a barn on the family farm in Henrietta, Tenn., a small town about 30 minutes from Nashville. She delighted in telling visitors she grew up in a house built by the outlaw Jesse James and related stories about milking cows, pitching hay and working the tobacco fields  among the family's assorted businesses during her childhood.

Politics as usual.
It's also a war in which a principal tactic is accusing the other side of fighting a class war while denying that you're fighting one yourself. Meanwhile, everybody claims to be on the same side: the side of the people, against the aristocratic elitist snobs who … where did I park my tumbrel?

Slate said "the proposed health care reform does not take over the system in any sense." In a New York Times economics blog, Princeton University professor Uwe Reinhardt, an expert in health care economics, said, "Yes, there would be a substantial government-mandated reorganization of this relatively small corner of the private health insurance market (that serves people who have been buying individual policies). But that hardly constitutes a government takeover of American health care."

Hope runs high that flights could start by spring. And even if it fails, Mike Jones said, it still represents the kind of big-picture economic development project the region ought to try more often.

Sometimes the best part of vacation is having time to follow a whim. Halfway through a tour of Wales, I saw an advertisement for an art exhibition in a town I hadn't planned to visit. On a whim, I packed my bags and went there.
Brent crude fell $2.84, or 2.5 percent, to $110.83 per barrel on the ICE Futures exchange.
Who's in: Joe Southwick has only two seasons remaining to make his mark in Boise, which means all he could do to truly compete with Moore is win a national title. Then again, Southwick might not start at all. Remember the name of true freshman Nick Patti, who moved across the country from Orlando to enroll a semester early in Chris Petersen's program. Patti is even smaller than Moore but much faster, and there isn't a thing wrong with his throwing arm.
As part of the redesign, the district also said it would strengthen its lowest-achieving elementary and middle schools. They would get a longer school day and school year, stronger principals if needed, and would no longer have to hire teachers unloaded by other schools.

I believe marriage is a commitment between two people who love each other and want to spend the rest of their lives with each other. I also believe if a marriage doesn’t work out divorce is a viable option. But I’m curious about open marriages. Why even get married if you’re going to stray anyway? Is there something missing in that relationship? It seems like an arrangement. Enlighten me! — Sandy

We needn't have worried. "Puss in Boots" is a surprisingly delightful adventure romp, with the Antonio Banderas-voiced cat a fugitive from justice, who tries -- with Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and his old friend Humpty-Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) -- to wrest magical beans from the evil Jack and Jill (played as lowlife trash by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris) in an effort to swipe the goose that laid the golden egg. It involves all manner of schemes, plotting and backstabbing, but best of all it brings back the smart humor of the first "Shrek."
