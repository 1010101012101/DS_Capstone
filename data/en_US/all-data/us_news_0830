But you wonder: By the time he plunked Tulowitzki, had Jimenez already thrown away the promise of his career? Far more disconcerting than losing control of his fastball is losing a grip on his fragile emotions.
"I voted 'no' on the ban based on the facts that it is not sound public policy, and it also only increases costs and regulations on the 1.5 million residents and the businesses residing in the county's unincorporated areas — and not the county's 88 cities," Antonovich wrote in a statement about the ban.

Santorum drew sharp criticism after saying in 2003 that he believed states had the right to ban gay sex or other private behaviors "antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family." He brought up a pending Supreme Court case over a Texas sodomy law and said, "If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery."
Another student pulled Prado from the deep end, and McKee began CPR.
Among the attributes I most envy in a public man (or woman) is the ability to lie. If that ability is coupled with no sense of humor, you have the sort of man who can be a successful football coach, a CEO or, when you come right down to it, a presidential candidate. Such a man is Mitt Romney.
In February, Linger Longer Chairman Mercer Reynolds told members the banks were demanding repayment of $45 million by April. He and his cousin had put up an additional $60 million in land as collateral.

Support for the new bailout deal has cost the major parties heavily. Until recently, New Democracy hoped to win outright, but now has the backing of only around 25% of voters, polls suggest. Pasok, which won a landslide victory in 2009, has slumped to 15% or lower.
But you feel comfortable going into the season with those guys?
During periodic breaks in the storm, the woodland birds reappeared as if by magic. Black-capped chickadees approached practically at arm's length either out of curiosity or seeking a handout of sunflower seeds. Tufted titmice, white-breasted nuthatches and downy woodpeckers gleaned the bark of towering oak trees, and a red-bellied woodpecker called unseen from the treetops.

The message?
On Saturday, the matchup is a Wisconsin team dreaming about a possible national championship vs an embarrassed OSU team trying to forget what happened in Week 1. ... football coaches like to say teams make their biggest improvement from Week 1 to Week 2, so maybe Oregon State has a puncher's chance if its offense is cooking. ... of course, we are not 100 percent sure right now which quarterback will be running that OSU offense, Ryan Katz or Sean Mannion or a combination of the two.

Now, they will pack their bags for the second round. They went 2-1 against the Celtics this season.
I have no real strong feelings on the Whitecaps either positively or negatively. They are generally pretty nice guys, in a nice town, which makes for fun trips. They are rivals more by dint of geography than antagonism. I think the Sounders are a pretty good benchmark of everything I hope the Timbers never become. They all look the same, sound the same, are even led to the stadium like cattle the same.
After intermission, the Symphonic Fragments from Roussel's ballet "The Spider's Feast" proved equally arresting, with plenty of narrative detail and an evocative solo from principal flutist Tim Day. And the Stravinsky sounded at once reflective and theatrically vivid, from the ominous murmurings of the opening through the explosive "Infernal Dance" to the sunny conclusion, its dynamic shadings impeccably controlled.
"We are leaving this city in better shape than when we found it," Mayor Jack Hoffman said of his decision to support the agreement. "What I think is really important is that what we're doing is redeveloping a property that will add to downtown Lake Oswego and the quality of life in Lake Oswego."

Restaurants and bars can exist on either side of the Haimish Line. At some diners and family restaurants, people are more comfortable leaning back, laughing loud, interrupting more and sweeping one another up in a collective euphoria. They talk more to the servers, and even across tables. At nicer restaurants, the food is better, the atmosphere is more refined, but there is a tighter code about what is permissible.
"It's the perfect place to hold a street race," Hunter-Reay said. "The location is perfect. It's an amazing area, and I hope the race works. I also hope I like the track."

We relaxed with a glass of Chilean Malbec while a guide gave us a menu of excursions for the week and asked about our wish list and fitness levels. We'd had visions of climbing volcanoes and even brought heavy-duty boots and down parkas. But it was winter, and the guide told us that we'd need Everest-worthy gear — and training — to get to the top this time of year. We'd also need several days to acclimate to the altitude, which settled it.
Or try your luck at the bleachers. Tickets go on sale two hours before the first pitch. General bleachers admission for May games costs $42 to $58; August bleachers seats cost $72. Fans here tend to be younger and rowdier; think hard before bringing your 5-year-old in the Redbird jumper.

Maybe it was Harrison's desire to be anywhere else but in the bowels of Congress, or maybe it was his genuine outrage at what he calls the administration's "draconian violation of our First Amendment rights," but during his five-minute testimony Thursday, he was visibly angry. With his glasses, bushy mustache and the unyielding delivery of his statement, he brought to mind President Theodore Roosevelt.

Caballero said she doesn't know what would happen if the Coliseum were unable to pay its $1 million annual rent to the state.
He has rifled through 16 different lineups in 18 games, oddly choosing to search for offensive consistency by changing things on a daily basis. He has seemed to rein in the Angels' aggressive base running — only to have two runners caught stealing at the top of innings Wednesday. He has found little reliability in the bullpen — and yet, left Jason Isringhausen in long enough to walk four batters and force in a run in the eighth. That decision proved costly when the Angels scored an unearned run in the ninth.
"We cannot commit at this time to playing at a venue where some of our students' safety or liberty might be placed at risk because of state immigration law," Superintendent George Fornero said in a letter to parents.

"When Rip hit that shot, I was looking in our guys' eyes," Collins said. "Somehow, we fought back."
Were there heroes of Watergate? Surely many unknown ones, those who did their best to be constructive and not destructive, those who didn't think it was all about their beautiful careers. I'll give you a candidate for great man of the era: Chuck Colson. Colson functioned in the Nixon White House as a genuinely bad man, went to prison and emerged a genuinely good man. He told the truth about himself in "Born Again," a book not fully appreciated as the great Washington classic it is, and has devoted his life to helping prisoners and their families. He paid the price, told the truth, blamed no one but himself, and turned his shame into something helpful. Children aren't dead because of him. There are children who are alive because of him.
Here's a look at January's greatest hits.
"We're still moving toward the consensus of 71 votes on marriage equality," he said. "If it weren't to pass, I don't see this issue going away."

Barnett, a springy 6-foot-7 swingman, entered the McCluer rematch averaging 12.7 points, but he surpassed his scoring average in the first half. He scored seven points in the first quarter, as the Cadets raced to a 22-8 lead and had 15 by halftime as CBC held a 36-20 edge.
The Blues didn't beat San Jose as emphatically as they could have Monday night.
Randle didn’t test extremely well (4.55-second 40-yard dash) and neither did Nicks. But like Nicks, the Giants see Randle as a good route runner who plays fast on game days.

Neuhard's computer, logs and backup files were seized and preserved by staffers at the office, which represents indigent defendants in appellate cases, so they could be turned over to law enforcement.

The takeaway: The Fighting Irish have lost three of their past five games after a nine-game winning streak. Notre Dame has averaged just 56.2 points in those five games. The Fighting Irish ranks 41st nationally in scoring defense (61.5 ppg).

The camps have existed in one form or another since 1916 — they were the brainchild of Stephen Mather, the father of the National Park Service — yet they remain off the radar to many Yosemite visitors. Those in the know apply for openings through a lottery system each fall — last year 3,300 people competed for 850 slots — or work the busy cancellations market that typically opens up around Memorial Day.
A. We live in a cynical world, where the culture I come from thinks the more esoteric and alternative you are, the cooler you are. But there's something refreshing about the approach of country music. There is no cynicism. There is narrative storytelling. It's straight from the soul, and it's true. I appreciate that so much. I love the lack of irony, and the lack of the hipper-than thou stuff in it. I like that the more real you are, the better you are. It's cool to me. I'm taken with it.

For years, the A's were a model of stability and productivity at third base. Sal Bando, Carney Lansford and Eric Chavez each played nearly a decade at the position for Oakland, and decent players such as Wayne Gross and Scott Brosius bridged the gaps between those three standouts.
I was so glad to see that Ellisville is fighting this TIF giveaway for Manchester and Clarkson Road. It really doesn't do anything to help the citizens in the long run. I live in Richmond Heights, and I moved here before the Galleria was expanded to its current form. We were promised everything, a rose garden you might say, and everything under the sun. Next month it's been 28 years and I'm still waiting for sidewalks, streets, curbs, driveway aprons. Mine is not the only neighborhood. There are other areas that are the same way. So, city governments can say one thing and do another. It sounds like Ellisville is the place to live and the place to shop, where they really do look out for the benefit of their citizens.

76': Back and forth in the midfield they go. The U.S. is back in the game. Rapinoe gets the ball and moves it down the left flank, works toward the box, but the play is disrupted by the French defense.
Yet, in 2008, physicians and the American people won a great victory. Congress moved to allow the National Institutes of Health Public Access Policy to provide free access to the results of the approximately 90,000 governmentally funded studies published each year. This policy provides access to NIH-funded studies within one year of publication, providing at least reasonably new information upon which physicians can make their clinical decisions. However, not all scientific information is publicly accessible — and what is available has been the target of a recent industry-sponsored attack.

The relentless advance of technology is driven largely by the steadily increasing power of microprocessors. As that power increases, so do the capabilities of the researchers who are pushing the limits of artificial intelligence.

At a nightclub the first night, where some of its well-connected patrons might "help" on the pageant front, Laura gets caught in the crossfire of a gang shootout, with the terrified girl surviving but seeing too much and, worse, being seen. The filmmakers use Laura's desperate bid to survive to make Mexico's drug crises punishingly personal. Bit by bit, her confidence is eroded, her instincts questioned, beginning with the pageant director who snipes that her hands look like a maid's and ending again and again with the poisonous Lino (Noe Hernandez), the local drug honcho she keeps crossing.

tndoc3: Old fuddy duddy here Gail, I can't imagine television getting any stupider than it is now. When will the people that choose these show understand that we are not children that have to be treated like we are stupid. The shows are getting bolder and bolder with the language and the content as well as the recycling of older and better shows with modern spins. Doesn't anyone have an new thought or is this too much to ask these days? There are many shows on cable and other outlets that are well written and have some original thinking but really now and I am not a prude but when a show centers around things like tampons in the bathroom and such aren't we getting really more and more gross and stupid in our programming? I know the prime time and children's programming is just as bad. Our students and children aren't stupid or uneducated about the world but must we have it shoved down our throats on our programming? Don't get me started about the movies nowadays. It is just as bad. Thanks Gail. I have watched television since it was first on the air in the late 40's so I have some background in the media. I have been and extra in some movies and been an extra in some television series in the 1960's.

President Barack Obama, however, should proceed with great caution. It's still too early to gauge the effect of bin Laden's absence on the Taliban and on al-Qaida.

Neither a goalie coach,a trainer, nor even Halak himself could replicate the rigors that he experienced his first time as a No. 1 netminder - the mental fatigue, playing on back-to-back nights and shaking off sub-par performances.
