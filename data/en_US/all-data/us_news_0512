The city and its merchants have been proactive. Many have taken part in a "Rediscover Anoka" online campaign that asks customers to take the pledge "not to be afraid of orange cones, one-lane-only signs and plywood sidewalks" during the Main Street makeover.

There are plenty of fun inside stories, like when Noah Wyle of "ER" recalled being introduced to Rebecca De Mornay at a party for what he thought was the first time, only to be tartly informed by the actress that she had done six "ER" episodes and they had even shared a sex scene.

Those who are concerned about Romney’s Mormonism generally fall into two camps: those on the secular left, like my friend, who are a bit suspicious of any religion, except maybe Unitarianism; or those on the religious right who consider Mormonism to be a perversion of true Christianity. Those on the left are already in President Obama’s camp, so there would be no advantage in placating them with attacks on Romney’s faith. Those on the right? Well, they will hold their nose and vote for the Republican candidate because, for them, having a Mormon in the White House is not nearly as bad as giving that Muslim guy four more years to ruin the country.

Much of The Plain Dealer's coverage focused on the miniscule amount of money that the state receives for this information. State law only allows the government to recoup the funds used to provide the data, which means they may not charge these companies more. While it is outrageous that our privacy is sold for fractions of a cent, would it be less troubling if the state earned $5 for our most private information? How about $10?

In Sacramento Superior Court, we have lost almost 200 positions. In our family court, litigants have to wait as long as three hours just to have their child custody disputes heard. In neighboring San Joaquin, courtrooms in Lodi and Tracy were closed as 45 employees were laid off. That court had to get $1 million in emergency funding and a $916,000 loan just to avoid more layoffs and court closures. Statewide, 23 courts have shut their courtrooms.
We never saw my mom cry after that horrible day in Feb. of 1959. Mom never preached to us or talked down to us and she especially didn’t let us know how smart she was. She gave us as much freedom as we could handle. One night I casually strolled into her room to ask if she had $2000 so I could put on a rock & roll show. She asked me a few questions and in spite of the fact I had never done it before, she found the money. She had me sign a promissory note that guaranteed I would pay her back with interest. If she had said “no” that night, my life would have been different. Not a little different, but a whole lot different.

She had fallen in love with a man, and soon they would marry. He had a daughter from a previous relationship, and Brown had fallen in love with her, too -- she called her "an amazing gift."

Are their faces too dark for the world to care? Their eyes too deeply brown to see within their stare the glare of humanity that glistens like the constellations, even in a world darkened by cold depravity?

At Hidden Springs, beside a 27-stall barn they had built to match the white-stone and hunter-green-trimmed main barn, is a perfectly restored gasoline and kerosene truck like the one Bob's grandfather drove back in Missouri, where he was raised.

That attitude might not cut it this year. A new state law is requiring that any student athlete even suspected of having a concussion get an OK from a doctor before playing again.

Visa and MasterCard have been jacking up swipe fees for years. That has kept the banks happy and encouraged them to issue more cards. Meanwhile, the banks most efficient at processing transactions have profited the most from the fixed fees. Ordinarily, competitive pressure would force them to pass on some of their increased efficiency to consumers in the form of lower fees. The genius of the way the system is rigged, however, is that the banks don't set the fees and therefore don't have to compete with one another. They are insulated from competition by Visa and MasterCard, and they happily profit from it.

The whole evening is set on one small steam-powered riverboat as it carries a pack of troubled lovers down the Amazon River in the early 1900s. But the designers open it up, mostly with the help of giant moving images behind the singers. Waves ripple, clouds pass, a bird flies off, giant daisies bloom.

Well, if they can secure private financing to clean up the old barn and make it functional for a few more years, while bolstering their depleted team payroll and providing a decent product, they should go for it.

At first, a few industry observers complained that the non-degree school is really a way for the agency to get free labor. But the students don't walk away empty-handed: They've spent 13 months working for one of the best agencies in the world.

Nearly everyone else has secured creative employment across the country.
Still, it's not quite clear what all these planes would carry. The exports that move most through St. Louis - such as coal, grain and scrap metal - don't fly.

Despite the fee that some patients have to pay, they often end up saving money by switching from brand-name to generic drugs or dropping medication they no longer need. Others put an end to nausea, drowsiness and other side effects by changing drugs or taking them at different times.

Certainly "Crystal Skull," which hits theaters in the U.S. this Thursday, couldn't have had a more eager, not to say rabid, audience anywhere in the world than the one at the Cannes Film Festival for its pair of Sunday screenings. The chaos at the press entrance was remarkable at the first screening, with frantic cinephiles pushing, shoving, attempting to jump over barriers and engaging in fierce shouting matches with the guards. And inside the normally decorous Grand Theatre Lumiere, where the festival's closing ceremony is held, there was unprecedented cheering as the opening credits rolled.

A: Well, obviously we're in the lead-up to some kind of a discussion with the players' union about our future collective bargaining agreement, so I'm kind of constrained, I am constrained, about what I can say. I've been on record many times in the past about the challenge of being competitive with NBA teams in smaller markets. You're seeing that recently with what's happening with the Kings and before that with the Sonics, people looking for other places where they think they can be in a better financial situation. There are substantial challenges and as an owner you just hope for the health of the league and for teams in smaller markets that whatever new collective bargaining agreement we arrive at that those teams in those markets are in a better place. But it's true for all leagues. You see the same thing happening in the NFL and other leagues as well. The danger is if you don't do something to address that you end up with the higher revenue teams being the dominant teams in those leagues and that's not a good solution for, I don't think for leagues and for fans as a whole because there are always the same four, five, six, seven contenders and they're usually larger market teams and it's just sad for the owners, sorry, sad for the fans and tough for the owners of those teams in smaller markets. It's a very interesting time for collective bargaining with both the NFL and the NBA.

Understandably, early polling shows many voters undecided or knowing little about the three.

You know where they're going. You love where they're going. But wow, it's an interesting wait, sometimes. But that goes beyond Roy. That's an issue for a team that failed to get anything from Gerald Wallace and Wesley Matthews in what would have gone down as dismal first half had Roy and Co. not ripped off that 20-0 run in the paint to start the second half.
Knight gets his share of fair criticism. He's opinionated. He didn't build the bold Nike empire by tip-toeing around. But as the uniforms were unveiled on Tuesday, and the eyes darted from the Blazers and everything else on the planet to photographs of a Rose Bowl uniform, it was plainly obvious how wise the guy is.

After drawing the early tip time in Nashville, Texas appeared to sleepwalk through much of the first half. The Longhorns got their first basket off a jumper near the free-throw line by Lewis just over 2 minutes into the game.
The goals of the 2008 energy law may have seemed simple, but putting it into effect proved complicated. Utilities, renewable energy supporters and consumer groups fought for a year and a half over rules to implement Proposition C, never reaching consensus. The Public Service Commission finally approved a set of rules by a 3-2 vote. But a key provision was later struck down by a little-known legislative committee called the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules.
Stanton said the office will provide lawyers to represent the state, although Paul Senseman, spokesman for Gov. Jan Brewer, said Brewer is empowered to select someone if she doesn't like the office's appointment.
The game, he said, is slowing down for him. If true, it accelerates his progress. He did not trust his ability to read college coverages after he was thrown into the lineup as a starter in the fourth game. But he is not afraid of failure. He was beaten by a Penn State tackler on third-and-1 when he fumbled. It was almost a game-breaking touchdown. Penn State is on his list now, too.
The 12,561-square-foot home, which she bought in 1987 for $2.7 million, is described in its listing as modern, full of natural light, with three fireplaces, walk-in closets, a bar (uh-oh), floor-to-ceiling windows, and a four-car garage. The (quite frankly rather dated-looking, and we're not the only ones who think so) home has Frank Lloyd Wright-style stained glass in the entry, an enormous kitchen, and what appears to be a custom-made bed in the center of the master bedroom.
Eventually a new decade began, a more conservative culture took hold, and the trend sputtered out. Sean S. Cunningham, who had produced “Last House,” turned to the blood-on-white-bread horrors of the “Friday the 13th” series; Wes Craven, who had directed “Last House” (and “Hills”) moved on to the surreal psychology of “A Nightmare on Elm Street” and the self-mockery of “Scream.” The good-ol’-boy beasts seemed to come to a quiet end.

It’s been a whirlwind of a breakout season for Victor Cruz, complete with appearances and obligations he never expected. So after Sunday’s playoff victory over the Atlanta Falcons, he told his expecting girlfriend Elaina they should relax and spend a quiet night alone.
But if Mickey wasn't in the Ed Helms/John C. Reilly comedy, he is in Thin Ice. It's a darkly comic morality tale in which - if you ignore the upbeat, voice-overed prologue and epilogue - our hero finds himself trapped in a nightmarish scenario of larceny and murder. A nightmarish scenario of his own making.

And so he did, starting the odyssey of a ballplayer who left the Giants two weeks ago to go home to Florida, where he had a second panic attack one day later and, finally, after insisting to the team that he had a "family emergency," phoned trainers and described what really happened.
Warner Bros. is clearly proud of its new attraction. One of the creators' few regrets is that trains to Watford, which will carry many of the site's visitors, leave from London's Euston station, rather than nearby King's Cross, whose imaginary platform 9 3/4 was the terminus of the Hogwarts Express. Rearranging the railways is beyond even Harry Potter's powers.
SMARxT Disposal recommends that unused medicines, unless specified otherwise by the FDA, should be mixed with something that makes it unappealing to eat (such as cat litter or coffee grounds); sealed in an opaque container safely secure from children, pets and others; and discarded in household trash to be later incinerated or placed in a government approved solid waste landfill.

"One of the biggest frustrations about road construction projects is the lack of safe traffic control. As a driver approaches the construction area, a flagger waves a sign. From 500 feet away, it's hard to distinguish whether the sign reads stop or slow. Both signs have a similar shape and similar color. It's amazing that there aren't more accidents. Couldn't one sign be the color green?"

Is there a role for me? I’ll just have to wait.”
• Bob Condotta, Seattle Times: Getting bowl eligible key for Huskies: Oregon has won seven consecutive games against UW, all by 20 or more points, and opened as a 15-point favorite in the initial Las Vegas betting lines.

The country's recent building boom has left Madrid with a top-class transportation system, from gleaming subways to brand new highways and a vast new airport terminal.
Take the one painted a striking cobalt blue and canary yellow — the livery of San Francisco's trams of the 1940s. Or the Washington, D.C., tram of the same era, with its interlocking curved stripes of white, pale blue, teal and red. My favorite is the San Diego car painted a postwar pea green with cream and brown trimmings and the instruction to "RIDE & RELAX" in black lettering on the side.
First, they're not in. They are 20-5. They could be, in a worst-case scenario, 20-11 on March 6. That would not get them in. Now, is it likely they finish 20-11? No. So what does it take to get in? (Or, what would it take to get them out?)

Le Carr�'s book was also the basis of a popular BBC miniseries with Alec Guinness in the role of Smiley. Alfredson doesn't have that much time to tell the complex story, but it doesn't really matter. The details are murky, but they're meant to be. These guys aren't James Bond-type heroes. They exchange dribs and drabs of information in drab, depressing offices and apartments. They're watchers, a word Jim Prideaux (Strong) uses in another context, which makes the word all the more chilling.
Some local residents have come out behind Breakwater, saying a growing establishment would provide a much-needed alternative medicine for patients with diseases like cancer or multiple sclerosis.

_ ITALY: Silvio Berlusconi, the long-serving Teflon leader accused of everything from bedding escorts to serial corruption, finally bites the dust in November 2011. He resigns to cheers and jeers as investors lose confidence in his ability to spur economic growth and rein in debt. It's the end of a political era. Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner, is named to replace him and lead a technical government until elections in 2013.

There is really good food to be had at Harvest Kitchen and Lounge, and it has been noticed. On a previous Saturday night, the place was packed. Longo clearly cares about quality ingredients, and the menu is impressive. But when push comes to plate, it's all about execution.

Whether the "stimulus" package "worked" remains to be seen. That the philosophy behind it has put this country on an unsustainable path is crystal clear. Without a recognition of that fact, we will be the Greece of 2030. Keep the tea party protesters here; send writers like Paul Krugman and Mr. Schaller on the slow barge to Europe.
The proposed new rules would require a mandatory head-count and lower staff-child ratios on field trips. Swimming trips would require significantly reduced ratios - as low as a one child per staff member for very young children.

Many of the six candidates for Los Angeles County district attorney say they would seek out and prosecute corruption by elected officials, and it's no wonder.

Le Royal Monceau, meanwhile, occupies a building that has been a hotel since 1928 in the same distinguished neighborhood as Le Bristol but otherwise a world away.

Snapshot: One of the few hydrangeas native to North America, this pretty deciduous shrub offers both lovely white flowers in summer and gorgeous fall foliage. In October, the bright green leaves turn rich purple or bronze, making this bush stand out in the autumn garden. Unlike other hydrangeas, oakleafs (which get their name from their distinctive foliage) prefer dry soil with excellent drainage and can withstand more sun than their lace-cap cousins. The dwarf "Pee Wee" variety stays compact, making it ideal for smaller gardens. You can see specimens in the arboretum's gazebo garden on the UC Davis campus.
Medina, who lived in the house with her husband, Steven Nevarez, 31, and their sons, Steven, 4, and Sebastian, 7 months, said she was disappointed that firefighters could not save her house, but she understood that they were busy fighting other fires.

Mr. Dempsey's bill changes Missouri employment law to make it harder to prove discrimination. It caps damages juries can award if a worker sues for employment discrimination. The cap not only would limit employer costs, but it also might make it harder for a worker to find a lawyer to argue his case. The bill also makes it harder for whistleblowers to receive protection and caps awards in their cases.
Dogs would fortify such inspections. During Tuesday's demonstration at the Ramsey County compost site, Wicket found two small ash logs in a large pile of mixed tree waste, and Denali homed in on three bags of infested mulch that had been buried in the 5-foot-tall mulch pile. The dogs in training will begin more "real-life" situations in July, checking ash that's been freshly removed from public and private land and brought to waste sites, Hurt said.

Biracial Clover Love has lost her employment as managing director of mortgage-backed securities with the belly-up Lehman Brothers. Bisexual Addison Hunt is about to discover that the trust fund she and her husband have been living off has been drained by a reckless investment in a Madoff feeder fund. Mia Mandlebaum Zane, former actress, now a full-time mom of four married to Jonathan  a Hollywood director of romantic comedies  has dangerously over-spent the couple's income on household embellishments.

The deacon clearly did not like me. She was a retired teacher from a not-respected college, teaching in a not-respected curriculum, where she claimed she had great power. She insisted that only she and the senior cleric could read the gospel. Even though the senior guy had for three years allowed the youth to read the gospel, the deacon was determined in every way possible to prevent the youth from reading.
For the first time, the Edgemont couple raised a possibility that she was drugged.

He certainly looked the part last year for first-year program Lake Nona. Sousa passed for 1,290 yards and eight touchdowns and rushed for another 859 yards and five scores in the first seven games, but injured his knee in the eighth game and was done for the season. Not too shabby for seven games.

The House of Representatives this week could pass bills limiting the consumer bureau's power, although any such measures will face difficulty in the Senate. Still, it takes 60 votes in the 100-member Senate to overcome hurdles to a confirmation, and 44 Republicans Senates have said already that they will not vote for any nominee, regardless of party affiliation, unless the bureau is given more transparency and accountability.
Between 2007 and 2010, Gerardi stated in the complaint, Taylor also wrote himself 44 checks from the local’s petty cash account, totaling $13,650.

Under Kasich's plan, Ohio would use a new formula assigning a grade of A, B, C, D, or F for each school and district, much like students currently receive in class. The districts would be graded in five areas: overall performance, student performance, individual student population performance (such as disabled children), academic growth, and whether gaps among various student groups are being closed.

Pat Forde, Yahoo! Sports: "We're not even to May yet, but Arkansas athletic director Jeff Long gets the early vote for Administrator of the Year in college football. Long did the right thing – even though it was the hard thing – when he fired super-successful coach Bobby Petrino. Long handled that difficult duty with enough fortitude and passion that it turned fan disappointment and anger into pride in the institution. Big-money donations immediately flowed in after Long deposed his duplicitous coach. Now Long has backed that up with a smart hire in John L. Smith as Petrino's short-term replacement. Not a sexy hire, but a smart one. The Arkansas fans wildly wishing for one of the Usual Untouchable Suspects – Jon Gruden, Steve Mariucci, the ghost of Bear Bryant – may not love it. The Arkansas fans wildly wishing for one of the Unusual Suspects – Sean Payton or a current head coach at a powerhouse program – will be disappointed. But the Arkansas fans who want what's best for both a very talented 2012 team and the future will indeed be happy with John L. He's the best available man for the job."

She blasted the prosecution for failing to bring the case to trial on time despite having “the benefit of an extensive investigation resulting in solid physical evidence” gathered during the Internal Affairs probe.
Adele performs with a small combo, but is fundamentally a solo artist. She doesn’t indulge in the sort of headline-grabbing shenanigans that derail pop careers; so far, at least, she seems refreshingly devoted to her music. She comes off as imperiled, and in need of protection and guidance — all of her songs are about heartbreak and men who have done her wrong, and a persistent vocal cord injury throws a shadow over her future. (To add to the drama, her performance tonight will be her first after months of recuperation.)

øAt least at the moment, the economy is showing signs of growth. "It's the most exposed to the improving economy," Heebner says.

As the economy picks up, hotel REITs should be the first to feel the improvement.

But other songwriters know how to mine Welch's multifaceted voice as well. James Ford, from the purist dance collective Simian Mobile Disco, collaborated with her on "Breaking Down," which sounds like the final missive of a stir-crazy ice princess from her frozen palace.

Coming out of WrestleMania, WWE presented a heck of a Raw. The show featured good in-ring action, particularly the Punk-Henry match; two re-debuts in Lord Tensai and Lesnar; and some strong storyline progression.

Despite the fact that top prospect Dylan Bundy was optioned to Class-A Delmarva on Sunday, it doesn't mean he will start the season in low Class-A, Showalter said. … Catcher Ronny Paulino, who missed the first three weeks of camp with visa issues, could start at DH Tuesday vs. the Rays. … Showalter said it was "obvious" that neither third baseman Josh Bell nor second baseman Ryan Adams — both of whom were cut Sunday — were going to make the club. The fact that both play just one position hurt them. … Right-hander Chris Tillman, who fared well Sunday vs. Boston, said coming into camp in better shape is helping him with his delivery. … Even though he was technically sent down to minor league camp Sunday, top prospect Manny Machado was back with the travel squad Monday and was a late sub. He has played in eight of nine games. He took a batted ball to the right leg during batting practice but was OK. … Showalter said several players who need work could participate in the minor league Class-A game on Monday, the team's only scheduled off day. … After Ryan Flaherty made his second error of the spring at shortstop Monday, Showalter said there's possibility he could also play some first base as well.

Life is full of contradictions, no more so than in the lives of birders.
The roller coaster of inflation followed by recession is out of control. In the last 12 years, leaders of both parties have tried in vain to slow its reckless course. At the same time, states compete with each other to extract more and more federal grants that are financed out of the deficits and not the productivity of the nation. It is, therefore, right that these same states join together to demand a constitutional amendment that will serve as the occasion for finally restraining the inflationary spending of the federal government. The nation, no less than the individual states, must eventually balance its books. The excuse that only annual deficits promote full employment is refuted by the continuing decline in productivity and investment which form the only true base of long term employment.

Your statement that the "normally routine move of raising the debt ceiling is being blocked by Republicans" is laughable. The situation is not normal, and the process should be anything but routine. It was "routine" actions on the debt ceiling over the last decade that helped get us into this mess, and the current Republican majority in the House is absolutely correct to refuse to allow more "routine" but irresponsible actions to proceed without demanding change. In case The Sun's editorial staff didn't notice, that's what the American people demanded in the 2010 mid-term elections. I think the members of your editorial board who are the ones living in Delta House and exhibiting "stupid and futile" ignorance of what the voters demanded in 2010.

To be as upbeat as possible about a fairly dismal movie year, there were, in fact, enough good feature films to fill a 10-best list. Another dozen or so American indies or foreign-language imports provided pleasure and offered promise for the future, but a future in which smaller, nonstudio films will increasingly be crowded out of movie theaters—that's happening now—and confined to an online existence as streaming video, or the digital equivalent of literary novels.
