We finished our lunch, I paid the bill, and we said our goodbyes. I told him that I wished I could do more for him. "Son, you did more for me today than anyone has ever done for me in all my years on the street," he said. "Most people just walk away when I ask them for help. Some look the other way and pretend not to notice me, others just shake their heads and walk on by. But you didn't walk away, and I thank you for that. I thank you for that." And with that, we went our separate ways.
The Navajo Nation court system is the largest and most established tribal legal system in the world. Since the landmark 1959 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Williams v. Lee that affirmed tribal court authority over reservation-based claims, the Navajo Nation has been at the vanguard of a far-reaching, transformative jurisprudential movement among Indian tribes in North America and indigenous peoples around the world to retrieve and use traditional values to address contemporary legal issues.

Saturday night, as Leo and I finished our final drinks and waited on our to-go food from the bar we hang out at now (Nick & Jake's on 135th, in case anyone is wondering. The bar scene there on a Saturday night is mildly ridiculous.), we talked about what movie we were gonna watch when we got home.

MARCH 1: Nathan Connally, 19, was shot about 2:30 a.m. near Dover and Soquel drives in Live Oak. He stumbled to an apartment at 2500 Soquel Drive and died there minutes later, according to sheriff’s deputies. Authorities released a surveillance video that showed Connally walking with another man before the shooting. That man, who has not been identified, is not a suspect in the case. Deputies have not said what motivated the shooting. No one has been arrested. Connally lived in Santa Cruz.
The first few minutes were incredibly awkward. I initially made a few remarks of censored indignation, for I had not been consulted in this decision, and I was counting on this evening to get caught up on workplace gossip. Instead, we made some stilted attempts at conversation about our families and our summer vacation plans. Pancho talked about ducks for approximately ten minutes.

While I have to admit that the alien race is given more attention to detail than one would expect, that doesn’t mean they make any more sense. Looking oddly human-esque, they have throw away powers, an incredibly poor weakness and the most bizarre rules of engagement I’ve ever seen. Despite proving that they’re clearly more capable at diminishing life expectancy than the humans within 5 minutes of their arrival, they spend a large portion of their time just waiting to be shot at. As in most wide audience blockbusters, science and reason take a brutal beating too. Interstellar communication is performed with giant lasers and obscene drifting techniques are performed with a ship larger than most small towns.

With the Lamb’s blood applied, we leave our captivity, our slavery to sin—the LORD brings us out with a strong hand. We need not forfeit our lives—we gain life everlasting because the Lamb forfeited his. We place our hope in Jesus’ sacrifice on our behalf. With haste, we then move out from our life of slavery and into the community of the saved—the church.

The final Golia thought from that day I remember was to the question: “Why do you live in Los Angeles?.” His response, simply, “Because it is close to Las Vegas and Los Alamos.” Now, for me, that response is the right mix of zany and smart to make me perk up and notice this small in stature but long in ideas Italian.

Inky blackness slowly warms into illuminated warehouse space,
At Halloween time at school, we always read Scottish poet Robbie Burn’s “Tam o’ Shanter”. It is a story of a man who stayed too long at the pub and what strange sights he sees on his way home. In a familiar situation, ladies’ man Tam had been warned by his wife to not stay out too late and not to drink too much. When he finally wanders home in the dark with his horse, Meg, he rides past the local kirk-yard (churchyard) only to spy a strange bonfire burning. There he sees a ghoulish collection of witches, warlocks, and the devil himself, dancing round the fire. Tam watches quietly until a beautiful, and scantily-clad, witch pursues him and gives him chase. Tam escapes, but the witches tear off Meg’s tail. Burns’ poem had a strong effect on me at the time, though the impact has lessened over time, especially the message of always listening to your wife’s directives.

I can't tell you how excited I am to begin another of Heather's courses. I learnt so much from 30 day vegan and this one will have so much more to offer as it's a 3 month course, I am so happy to be doing this with a friend as I'm sure at times I will find it a challenge and I know Rose will be there to listen and offer advice. Ummmm, you will be won't you Rose?
Otaku are a curious lot. The domestic, Japanese brand of zealousness is legendary, truly something marvelous and/or frightening to behold, as fervent devotion to favored idols, seiyuu, anime/manga characters, bands and other celebrities goes far beyond mere “fanaticism,” which is perhaps the closest Western analogue, although not nearly the same level of intensity. When scandal breaks, the otaku community erupts and the colossal outpouring of visceral response -be it bitterness; resentment; jealousy; or other form of discontent- can spread like a metastasizing, virulent contagion and the effects can linger long after things have technically “blown over.” They can be militantly hostile in defending an icon/franchise and are very outspoken if they feel industry professionals are not living up to perceived standards (Just ask Anno Hideaki).
Carrie Newcomer has incorporated spiritual themes, in the way most people use the term, into her songwriting for some time now. She has the gift of being able to frankly discuss this without ever getting preachy. These spiritual themes are even more in the foreground than usual on Newcomer’s new album, Everything is Everywhere. The album is the result of a trip to India Newcomer was able to make, and the chance to work with Indian musicians has made the music sound richer. Given all of this, I Believe, despite the title, might not be the most obvious choice. The song is largely a list of things in the mundane world. For me, that is exactly the point. The song is a wonderful expression of thankfulness for the every day miracles we all too easily overlook, and it is also a beautiful statement of humility in the face of this.
Because cloth diapers can last for years, you can almost always find gently used diapers for sale somewhere. Some of the most popular sites for used cloth diaper sales are diaperswappers, Spot's Corner and there are many facebook groups that focus only on buying, selling and trading (b/s/t) used diapers. Many cloth diaper stores also offer a gently used section. You can usually buy an entire stash of gently used cloth diapers at 50% or more off the retail price.
Lamb... not beef or kangaroo... is the true Australian meat. Try asking for a lamb sausage at Outback Steakhouse and see if they have it on the menu- you'll probably be disappointed.

It's difficult to be precise about how long each book takes. As I think I said, I quite often think about the ideas for several years before I actually start writing. Then, if all goes well, I suppose it takes around six months to a year to get a book finished. There are always some which don't work and have to broken up and started again, so Fever Crumb, for instance, took a couple of years.

Let me just say, I'm not such a great historian of boxing. I know about certain events, but I am not good with specific records, champions, etc. So I was talking to my grandpa about Floyd Mayweather and how my Grandpa sees Floyd as the second chapter of Muhammad Ali, amazing skills, loud mouth, and disrespectful everyone. So as we went through the history of boxing, he was giving me names of some greats from back in the day and I was looking them up. He didn't remember their numbers and was shocked that I could find them on the computer. lol. We've all heard the tales of Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, Joe Frazier, Lennox Lewis, Roy Jones, and so many others. But the fighters below are extremely overlooked and under appreciated for their massive impact on our sport. Some of these stats will blow your mind.

You state that it was the police and not the protest that stopped the forum. That is mere semantics as you are quoted as saying “I have negotiated with the Dang Wangi police to stop the forum at 9.30am or else we will act.” Now you expect us to believe that the police would have stopped the forum if your protest had not taken place? Do you think we were born yesterday? Stop twisting the truth. You have already threatened to “do it again” if the Bar Council attempted similar forums.

The police and Elizabeth assume it was a random attack. O’Brien thinks otherwise, and, as usual, his instincts prove correct. The attacker was after Molly, a college student and butterfly researcher. O’Brien quickly ascertains that the attempt must be in some way linked to Molly’s research in the Ocala National Forest.
His decision to sucker punch Steve Moore, resulted in a career ending injury. If you watch the video again, watch how barbaric hockey players become when the unexpected variable arrives.

Jordan is the greatest of all time. So great that Pat Riley of the Miami Heat retired Michael Jordan’s jersey. His legacy was so great that he believes nobody on the Heat deserve to wear that number. No LeBron didn’t just change his number he had too, and the whole change of scenery remark he made. Kobe changed his number from 8 to 24 to prove he is one better than Jordan. Like I said before that’s the only thing he has on him.

I’m enjoying an ice coffee while taking a break from working on one of my scripts. As promised, I at least want to write a blog 2-3 times a week. So at this point in the day, I will imagine for a moment or two that I am living in Prague, a beautiful place of the most awe aspiring architecture. I picture myself sitting near an open window. On this day, I mean early evening, I see people walk by, certainly not in any rush, but all seem to just stroll on by. Couples walking hand in hand, a child running along a few feet behind. A occasional car with its music escaping its windows, nothing ear shattering but a melody just right to accompany the sunset and the transformation from a workday into a beginning of the most tranquil of atmospheres, a warm nightlife.
I could have made it round, but I was following the pattern. The base is 6 1/2 inches. Then I crochet up for 7 inches, did the eyelet to get the leather bands through, and after that crochet another inch or so using a 4mm hook. I'm quite happy with it.
In 1976, Bukowski met Linda Lee Beighle, a health food restaurant owner, aspiring actress and devotee of Meher Baba, leader of an Indian religious society. Two years later Bukowski moved from the East Hollywood area, where he had lived for most of his life, to the harborside community of San Pedro, the southernmost district of the City of Los Angeles. Beighle followed him and they lived together intermittently over the next two years. They were eventually married by Manly Palmer Hall, a Canadian-born author and mystic, in 1985. Beighle is referred to as ‘Sara’ in Bukowski’s novels ‘Women and Hollywood.’

“Since the inception of the survey in 1940, only relatively minor changes have been made to the official definition of unemployment, despite numerous outside reviews and ongoing assessments by academicians, business and labor organizations and various interest groups. The official measure has withstood the test of time largely because of its objectivity,” John Bregger, former Assistant Commissioner for Current Employment Analysis wrote.
And those “dividends”? Now that I think about where they came from, I can’t believe I ever got excited about them. Since I only had a few late payments, nearly all of those “incentives” was coming from other suckers strung out on your line.

Otoliths are the ear bones of fishes used for balance and detecting vibrations. Much like a tree, otoliths exhibit growth rings. In temperate species these rings are annual, but in many tropical species rings are deposited daily. If there is a tight correlation between otolith size and fish size, then we can back-calculate an individual’s growth rate across its entire lifetime. To establish this correlation we studied two closely related species of wrasse, Thalassoma amblycephalum and T. bifasciatum. As a side project, we were interested in the degree of lateral symmetry between the otoliths on the right and left sides of an individual.

Also, the choppiness of dialogue sentences and whether the character speaks complete sentences may tell the character’s attitude or even education level. Consider how terse dialogue is spoken by a character who is combative, how sensitive phrases might be used by a caretaking character. Doing the reverse can be even more interesting. Consider how jokes from a bank robber make his/her character more interesting.

There is simply no way you can defeat this kind of thing short of disabling the phone or unplugging the landline. With a cell phone that means taking out the battery. With a landline, that means unplugging the phone from the wall.
When I say I have an eclectic range of friends and acquaintances I mean the people I mix with are incredibly diverse. There are those I choose to mix with even though I disagree with what they think. It gives me ammunition to have an ill-advised heated debate after a number of glasses of wine. Some I don’t choose to mix with but am required to by proximity. As an example, I have as someone who lives near me, the most appalling racist. I found this out after he had consumed the ‘judgement drink’. That’s the mouthful of alcohol you have when lose your power of good judgement and you cross the invisible line of feeling comfortable about saying out loud what you should keep to yourself. We have all taken this mouthful. For purposes of clarity it is about 3 glasses of alcohol after the ‘attractiveness drink’. That being the drink when you and those around you become more attractive than you or they where when the evening began.

The historical significance of the find is that it contains fresh detail that could finally restore the good name of the Duff Gordons, who were accused of urging, or even bribing, the crew of their boat to row away from the sinking ship and not to pick up survivors, even though the boat wasn’t full. Though they were cleared of all blame by the Board of Trade inquiry in May 1912, they were savagely cross-examined and remained tainted by suspicion that they had acted selfishly.

According to RTE, NAMA acquired the loans attached to the Maybourne Group “at a discount”. RTE doesn’t disclose its source but in its management reports NAMA has confirmed that a small number of loans were acquired with discounts of 0-10% which leaves open the possibility that NAMA acquired some loans without discounts. NAMA hasn’t revealed its profit on the loans, and judging by past history with the Montevetro transaction, the agency will remain tight-lipped about the profit or loss. Don’t worry though about the profit or loss; just feel the revenue – €800m!

She asks him if he can’t just be her friend like he was before. They’ve been friends for 20 years already. All this time, Seung Yeon has lived protecting Ji Woo and right now things are changing too quickly for her. He points out he wants to be more than just her friend, the person to protect her and her boyfriend and asks her if that’s wrong. She tells him no, it’s not wrong and before he can say more, Ji Woo continues.

In contrast, Chris is repressed and oppressed, unhappily married to a shrew (Rosalind Ivan) who he's never loved, who he married only out of a sense of desperate loneliness. When he's arguing with his wife about his paintings, he tells her, "I never saw a woman without any clothes," to which she huffily responds, "I should hope not," a perfect encapsulation of their sexless, miserable marriage. The film is full of moments like this; Dudley Nichols' screenplay crackles with clever dialogue and charged exchanges in which sex and violence are hidden within every line. The film is drenched in sex, its tension arising from the friction between the simmering repression of Chris and the over-ripe sensuality of Kitty. He asks to paint her and instead she reclines on the bed and sticks out her leg at him, stretching her foot out and telling him to paint her nails: "they'll be masterpieces." In another scene, Johnny wakes up after a drunken night and looks around the room, the camera panning over the scattered clothes and possessions of Kitty, strewn across the floor, the woman herself stepping out of an adjacent room in lingerie and an open robe.

Songbird and Big Shot had a fun conversation about Big Shot's high school cross country running career. Then, I believe, I was witness to the first ever over seventy year old black woman hitting on an over seventy year old white man who hasn't shaved in over 2 years and doesn't wear his teeth to a bar in the history of Kansas City. Yes I do consider myself lucky. When she asked him if he had ever been married he responded with a resounding "No, no never". Then, once again I'm speculating, made up a story on the spot about how he had a wedding ceremony in Thailand with a Thai girl and he loves her to this day. They're "divorced" now but he doesn't consider it a real marriage because the US didn't sanction it. I'll say it right now, I'm not going to vote for anyone for President who won't sanction the beautiful made up marriage of Big Shot and Ching Mai.

In Monster At Our Door, I cite what I thought was an absolutely model study, published in Science, about how breakneck urbanization in western Africa is occurring at the same time that European factory ships are coming in and scooping up all the fish protein. This has turned urban populations massively to bush meat – which was already a booming business because of construction crews logging out the last tropical forests in west Africa – and, presto: you get HIV, you get ebola, you get unknown plagues. I thought the article was an absolutely masterful description of inadvertent causal linkages, and the complex ecology – the environmental impact – that urbanization has. Likewise, with urbanization in China and southeast Asia, the industrialization of poultry seems to be one of the chief factors behind the threat of avian flu.

Eminem is subsequently referred to as Eminem Emin-Eminem. This sort of revelry in daftness gets me giggly, so as you might imagine, I had a lot of fun with the book.

All opponents of planning Israel’s evacuation are in their own ways correct. Recognizing this, for the interim America must reinforce the IDF and come to Israel’s defense in spite of the potentially devastating consequences there and even here at home. In fact fighting for the preservation of status quo Israel will be a key for maintaining American foreign policy legitimacy into the 21st century. Still, exponential developments in technology and its ceaseless proliferation to state sponsors like Iran mean that the rage of state sponsors of terrorism and the disenfranchised youth budge in Palestine and throughout the Mideast will come to threaten Israel’s physical existence very soon.

Back in 1989 when I was a somewhat awkward, repressed, geeky, closet-extrovert teen, me and a good mate of mine spent every Saturday evening for a month or two adlibbing comedy, songs and general testosterone fuelled mayhem onto C90 cassettes.

We are *so* not impressed with the designers. There were several of these. Silk, still with the tags. They didn't sell and were brought in and didn't sell at BJ's, either. So I'm supposed to see what I can do to it. I thought it would be just a matter of taking out the elastic--who THINKS of these things, putting this big hunk of thick, stiff elastic under the bust? It's just totally hideous on--when something makes even me look fat and bovine, you know something's wrong. Plus that zipper is unnecessary--I didn't even know it was there until after I had the dress on. So I thought I'd rip out the elastic and remove the zipper--it's too heavy and makes that side sag--but it turns out that the dress is actually three separate pieces: the bodice, that channel with elastic in it, and the skirt--all totally separate. I don't know if I'm up to it or not--it's a lot of work for something I would probably never wear (never fear: I have no plans to wear something like this as a dress--I am not one of those old women who, just because they're thin, think that means they can dress like a 20-year-old. Or a 30-year-old. I know some of those women, and I am not among their numbers. No, I would wear it, probably over a tank, as a tunic over cropped jeans. But the color doesn't grab me. I may do it, though, just because it's a challenge: I love trying to take something that was a horrible design and remake it into something that works. You know I do. I love those kinds of challenges.
Finally, begin now to make sure the worst never happens. Put together an action plan of exactly what you need to do to turn things around. By focusing on positive changes and implementing your action plan, your focus will shift to the positive outcomes and away from your fears. You will begin to feel better because now you can DO SOMETHING! Positive action is the only cure for fear and worry. Try this formula today and see if it will work for you. It has worked for me, if it hasn’t I wouldn’t be writing this blog. I would like to see people succeed and be the voice that I never had in my life, in your life to tell you that you can succeed, your dreams can come true, and through God all things are possible.

Oddly, as these two retrogrades are wrapping up, Venus is entering the sign where hers will take place in May and June. She rules what we value (money, possessions, our connections to others, traits and talents in ourselves), and she’s about to whip up a lot of talk and activity in that arena. About to, mind you. She moves on Tuesday into the communication and technology-happy sign of Gemini, but since that is ruled by Mercury — who is as good as motionless — her stay there will get off to a leisurely start.
Nepal’s score improved from 59 to 55 points thanks in part to better access to information and a decline in censorship. There were no journalists killed during the year, and fewer restrictions on the production and distribution of news.

I have never experienced anything as cold and dark as the inhabitants of Guernsey did during WW2. I've never suffered long term starvation, or feared for my life, once, let alone daily for five years. And I never had to make a decision about whether to send my child away for his own safety, and then having decided to do so (wisely in hindsight) lost contact with him (and the whole of the outside world) for five years. How must it have felt to not know how one's child is faring, if s/he is alive or dead, healthy or sick? Every day must have felt interminable and barely tenable. My reading was halted at that part by, not just tears, convulsions. I had to take several deep breaths before I could continue. Yet those people, mothers, fathers, grandparents, kept going and, mostly, survived; their children came home, and light returned. I felt much better after reading The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.

I think what I love most about Needful Things though is the originality of the story and the appeal of Gaunt's sadistically fun plan for people to plan pranks on others. I can just imagine Stephen King standing in front of a corkboard with push pins and strings - constructing the web of who's fighting with who and who plays the pranks that set them off. The supernatural element of the novel is somewhat downplayed, so that the story can focus more on the characters and the effect that Gaunt's tricks are having on them. Yes, Gaunt is a demon who steals souls, and seems to know just about everything about everybody in town, and has eyes that frequently change color, and is able to repulse anybody with just a touch, but that is the real extent of the supernatural that we get. It's the characters that are really at the forefront here, and what is brought out in them when their biggest fears are shoved in their faces, and I love the way that King chose to present that with this story. It's a highly original idea and it completely works with what King was trying to say. His writing style in this book is also what most people refer to as "vintage King" - like he's slightly sophisticated but still naughty and nasty at the same time.

We are reminded in Acts 3:1, that “Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer.” Of course, we now know that one can pray anywhere and at any time. But this was Jerusalem and this was early during the transition period. While in Jerusalem, the temple was the place to be for prayer, and there Paul was communicating with God.

The pack also came with a checklist or all 258 cards (206 players, 25 mascots, and 27 stadiums). A couple of questions. The checklist does not name every mascot (like Dinger, or Billy the Marlin). Was Topps not allowed to include the names of the Athletics, Blue Jays, Braves, Diamondbacks, Orioles, Royals, and White Sox mascots? And where is Lou Seal (the Giants mascot)? I know the Cubs, Angels, Dodgers, and Yankees don't have mascots, so I'm not worried about them. But where's Rosie Red's card?
Well, he called it. She passed away last night.

In the same vein if you asked an Indonesian "How are you?" they'd find it weird. It's a pretty intimate question if you think about it. Why would you casually ask about someone's mental state? It's a big can of worms if you attempt to answer it honestly.

Ahh, I can’t believe how lazy I have gotten in trying to keep up with this blog. I have a habit of just getting caught up in the moment of things; when I finally get home, I’m just tired and want to crawl in bed. However, I don’t have any real excuse for that.

I put the containers of meat and skin in the fridge and debated what to do next. The house still smelled pretty good -- the scent of braised pork in almost any form is a very nice thing, but even a fine-smelling, porky house does not make up for the fact that I knew I was sort of in the shitter on this one.

Two more decrees, issued by the Congregation of Sacred Rites on April 10, 1848, answered questions which had arisen. (1) The Mass of the Immaculate Conception, transferred to Sunday, has the Gloria and Credo and the Gospel of the Sunday at the end; and, if the Mass is sung, it has a commemoration only of the Sunday; if it is a private Mass, it has commemorations also of other feasts observed on that day. (2) The obligation of reciting the vespers of the divine office is satisfied by attendance at the vespers of the Immaculate Conception on the Sunday to which the feast is transferred.
As a sinner, my only hope for heaven lies in the full atonement made upon Calvary’s cross for the ungodly. I totally rely on this. There is no hope for me anywhere else. We are all in the same condition. We must all stand together at the foot of the cross, and trust our souls to the One who died for the guilty. Charles H. Spurgeon writes the following:

One thing that surprised me about blogging is all of the friends that I've made from all over the world. It's really incredible. A few months after I started, I discovered the Stats page and it blew my mind. I could never imagine that all of these people were reading my blog! I was perfectly happy when I thought that it was just my close friends and family reading it. I couldn't stop smiling after that discovery. It's hard to believe that I have readers from Australia, France, England, Japan, Russia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and so many other wonderful countries. I remember telling James one day that I have a reader from Latvia. That got me really excited because I didn't even know where Latvia was! (I promptly looked it up afterward lol) It's so fun to get to know someone who's half a world away and find out how similar we are :) I would love to get to know more of my readers so please join and leave comments!

Well, they were not lying. I stopped into Birds for a haircut this past Sunday. I was starting a new job on Tuesday and I needed to look sharp. This was my first time getting my mop cut at Birds.

It was October of 1990 when my friend Mary Ann was pictured chipping away at a portion of the wall. It had been almost a year since the Berlin Wall was opened, on November 9, 1989. But only a matter of weeks after Germany was officially reunited, on October 3, 1990. You could feel the change in the air, but also feel the chilly past of the cold war. It was still right over your shoulder.
If I were in a restaurant and a Cyclops-type system was shown next to each item on the menu - whether in the absence of a written description of each dish or in addition to it - I think I'd feel like the whole dining-out experience had been watered down just a little.

I want to give this chain a nod of approval for what they're trying to do. I'd also like to commemorate the fact that humane and sustainable practices are such selling point that they can make revenue climb from 1,835,922 to 2,269,548 between 2010 and 2011. But that any changes like this, no matter how incomplete or opaque, can make us excited enough to forget to ask further questions is a sad commentary on the way the fast food industry is currently being run.
More often than not, I write what I read. When I wrote my short story Take My Hand, I had been going through a medieval phase, devouring novels about knights and battles and grisly conflicts between the English and the Scots. One day I asked myself, “What if an Englishman and a Scotman became friends…and then were pitted against each other?” The idea just lodged in my brain and refused to leave until it became a full-fledged story.

And because of that, I can honestly say that the Blip Festival performances are some of the most energetic, most exciting, enthusiastic moments of chip music, because everyone is just so excited to be there.”

As expected, Mr. Kumar put forth the argument that MySpace was an ‘intermediary’ for the purposes of the IT Act, and hence could avail of the safe harbour provisions contained in S.79.

These modern times, we see how Capitalism drove economies to its height, providing affluence and at the same time poverty in extreme ends of society. This is the case, as investors so called capitalists play an important role in developing and forming new avenues of income for the lower class. Once businesses and factories are formed, the greed for profit is insatiable as debts from banks forces the entire systems to exploit the system and juice every single penny towards payment of interest which enriches the very few in the financial and investing circles all around the world. Their constant threat to the general populace and even to governments; we can close out and suffer the consequence of a dead economy. This scenario seems the status quo and business is usual as we don’t have an alternative system to go to or we’re just tired to change and better be enslaved to the system because at least we take joy in the crumbs that fall from our master taskmans’ table.

I usually hate mustard. I winch a little when I see someone eating a hot dog with a quart of mustard smothered all over it - even a little of that yellow-paste-of-the-devil on a hamburger bothers me. It's just not my thing. However, I always keep a bottle of dijon in the fridge for cooking. Adding a little bit of that crazy dijon to some recipes provides such a little, but lovely, zing to the flavor of the dish. Crazy, but true. I can still taste the dijon's actual 'mustardiness' but it's not enough to turn me away. And as we know, for me, it doesn't take much.
Last year, Mark Sterling and Jeremy Wyatt delivered the 2011 MWR Match of the year with the first ever 60 minute Iron Man Match during the MWR Years in January of 2011. When the 60 minutes expired and the bell rang, they were tied with no clear cut winner. The fans came to their feet chanting for more. 3XW’s Todd Contryman gave them what they wanted and the match continued. During an explosive 7 minutes of action it would be Mark Sterling who would have his hand raised in victory, thus earning the nickname “The Iron Man”

It's a seductive, addicting and fun game to play. I've won 400 dollars in one hand, and then other nights I've lost 160 dollars in one hand. I never let myself lose more than 160 which is 4 buy-ins at the level that I play at. But usually I'll only buy in twice, meaning I'll only lose 80.

I will let you do the detective work out what day that was last week! LOL. I made the tag shape too, cutting out her name and layering an off-cut from the dps (well, I don't like waste when it can be put to good use), from the front of the card placing it behind the cut-work so that it would peep through for a bit of added interest. I have written who the card is from (as if she didn't know!! LOL), on the reverse of the tag before slipping it into the pocket. The ribbon was from my stash.

Pace is also vital in both short stories and novels, according to Cally, 'With a short story you’ve got a limited number of words in which to tell your story. You can’t spend ages on the beginning and rush the middle and ending – they have to be evenly weighted. Short story writing taught me that description can slow a story whilst dialogue can speed it up. Using a mix of long and short sentences also helps vary pace. By writing short stories you learn to sense whether the pace is right, and when you’re writing a novel you can apply the same principles to scenes. If a scene seems to be dragging, it probably is!

If extended, this could lead to thousands in savings for the individual borrower. For example, depending on one’s tax bracket, every $10,000 in forgiven debt could incur as much as $1,500 to $3,500 in federal taxes. Thus, if $100,000 in mortgage debt is forgiven after a foreclosure, this could mean $15,000 to $35,000 in taxes owed for the borrower.

The human eye is a very complicated system consisting of the delicate conjunction of some 40 separate components. Let us consider just one of these components: for example, the lens. We do not usually realize it, but the thing that enables us to see things clearly is the constant automatic focusing of the lens. If you wish, you can carry out a small experiment on this subject: Hold your index finger up in the air. Then look at the tip of your finger, then at the wall behind it. Every time you look from your finger to the wall you will feel an adjustment.
When you peel that layer away, what you find underneath is that there are behaviours producing those results. Very often, they cannot be adequately expressed in conscious, linear, stepwise instructions — and that often fools people into thinking the skill is not teachable. (It's like you either have it or you don't. You might as well say, "it's magic".) And because these skills and behaviours are in the domain of unconscious competence, the performer might not even be conscious that they do them.

We thought we'd organised it brilliantly - we looked up the bus timetables online the day before, and I've used the 60-60 bus before. We decided to go early from Hay to give ourselves enough time to return by the bus that connected with the next to last Hay bus - we've done the nail-biting last minute journey where we were still at Libanus when we should have been in the bus station and we didn't know if we'd get the connection before, and we didn't want to do it again.

On its formation, the LeT joined the seven-year-old anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan, an armed insurgency directed and supervised by the ISI with funds and arms supplied by the CIA and the Saudis. Once the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989, the Army of the Pure turned its attention to a recently launched anti-Indian jihad in Indian-administered Kashmir and beyond. The terrorist attacks attributed to it range from the devastating multiple assaults in Mumbai in November 2008, which resulted in 166 deaths, including those six Americans, to a foiled attack on the Indian Parliament in New Delhi in December 2001, and a successful January 2010 attack on the airport in Kashmir’s capital Srinagar.

There’s also a wonderful picture of the lovely ladies of Sambhali working at the sewing centre sponsored by us. And our other lovely ladies Mina and Mala from our jewellery collection also make an appearance!
Recently I’ve been going over my priorities, and realizing I have not made the best decisions for myself. On a brighter note, it is not too late to change things. I will be doing what I love and being a better person.
I came away disappointed, I had looked forward to visiting an ancient manor house with lots of history and while there were a few features in some of the rooms, the overall restoration had too modern a feel and could have been handled more sympathetically in the kitchen/bathrooms particularly. The furniture was all supplied by the National Trust and some of it was more in keeping than the rest but overall I don't feel it had a lot to offer the person who loves history more than houses.
Created through a unique series of processes, Frost & Bjarnason’s initial sketches —improvised to the film— were fed through software designed to correct music which tried to turn their dense and distorted sonic input into a digital sequence of raw musical data. Working from data riddled with error and misunderstanding, a human score was orchestrated; the whole process deftly mirroring the core of the film’s own narrative of memory and loss, alien doppelgängers and emotional feedback loops. Brian Eno —who consulted closely in the creation of SÓLARIS— also used the same film to create a video accompaniment to this music in another strange loop of computer-generated distortion.

When starting my first novel, I couldn’t get more than a few pages into things before I’d freeze up and stop. I had no idea where things were going, so I couldn’t keep up the momentum. When that happened I felt like I wasn’t trying hard enough, like I was a quitter. But no matter what I did, I just couldn’t get the words on the page. How frustrating!
There’s been a little bit of an incarnation series going on here at A Better Possession. We started with a cheat sheet of theological terms to do with the incarnation here. Then we looked at the Incarnation and the Creed of Chalcedon here. Then we thought about the person and work of Christ here. And then we started a bit of a series within a series when we started looking at Kenosis.

Jayne Lewis from Mountain Goat shared her Rare Breed IPA after Kirrily had regaled us with tales of the original voyages to the Jewel in the Imperial Crown that first brought us this hoppy style. By now the audience was well refreshed and each brewer and her beer were welcomed warmly to the microphone. But the love for the Goat IPA was soon to be eclipsed by the Rock Star welcome reserved for Melbourne brewing identity and all-round-nice-girl, True South’s Sam Fuss.

So, as not to let them sit around unused on my computer I am sharing my files here. SInce I used PC's Carousel Lite cartridges I only have files for Design Studio and the Gypsy available here at this time. If you really like this idea but don't have either Design Studio, a Gypsy and/or the Carousel Cartridge, I am sure that you can google circus tent and find some clipart to use to create a .svg for use with Make the Cut (MTC) or with Sure Cuts A Lot (SCAL) or whatever software and/or cutter you might have. You can also easily create a "ticket" by cutting out a rectangle and using a small circle punch on each of the four corners (cut a half circle on each corner). I haven't had time to try to find another circus tent image and create either a .mtc or .svg file myself sorry!

I started with teeth. I found white vinyl upholstery fabric at my local JoAnns. I'm not sure why anyone would want vinyl upholstery, but the fabric is sturdy, doesn't fray, and seems perfect for making monster teeth. A bought a six-inch cut, which probably makes for a lifetime supply of crafty critter projects.
I came across an article on the Oratia Spinning and Craft Group
All those might, at last, perceive that they are rowing the same boat in stormy seas, its floatability depending on their harmonious cadence. Each faith can be permitted its own carry-on baggage, as long as it renounces claims that God’s truth is locked in its own satchel and no other. Each would have to admit humbly that it’s a blind man touching a different part of the same elephant. The theology and rituals of each should be respected by one and all, as long as the adherents acknowledge that theirs, just like their co-passengers’, is tinfoil wrapping a more solid but ineffable core, tied with a ribbon of tradition, warm remembrance of childhood, mother and father and a natural reluctance to take a sharp cognitive blade to warm and fuzzy parts of the self.
Sitting on such a desired prize, it makes one wonder at the African’s strange propensity to appear over grateful when a foreigner expresses interest in their country. They should indeed feel flattered but often appear submissive. One reason may be they feel they have little of value and believe themselves and their culture to be inferior. Whatever the reason they are hoping that the foreigner is going to help them.

My most special Christmas memory was the birth of our first child at 8:20 a.m. on Christmas morning. I was up late Christmas Eve playing gin rummy with my sister Sonya, and I had just been dealt a hand only a couple of cards shy of gin when Lynn announced that it was time. I wanted to finish that hand… but everyone else seemed to think that was a bad idea, so off to the hospital we went. With snow falling outside (the last white Christmas we've had, I think) and “Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer” playing on the radio (which Lynn was not enjoying), little Tressa came into our world to change it forever.

I really had a blast with this sketch and love to play with different items to have peeking over the circle panel. Today I chose to string balloons from the buttons to the top of the card - pretty fun! I picked up some Life of the Party paper by Basic Grey and matched it with Make a Wish from Taylored Expressions. The cake is stamped in Memento Tuxedo Black and colored in with Copics and then I cut it out and popped it up with dimensional tape. The balloons are cut out with the Make a Wish Balloons dies.
After recuperating and moving on, I continued to surf the web, peruse the stores, check out pins and even search on Craig’s List every once in a while. I actually thought Craig’s List would be my best bet since I was looking for style AND price and it turned out that I was right, but not exactly in the way I had thought. Instead of scoring a great deal on a used or new rustic table, I found someone to make me one. Ahhhhh!
I first enjoyed Lake Front’s Pumpkin Lager at a little Mexican restaurant on the west side of Denver almost a year ago exactly. The upside then was that they were having a special on this one and I originally recalled that it was on draft, but the more I think about it, the more I begin to recall that it was served in bottles. My brother-in-law was even coaxed into trying one and enjoyed it, I believe. I enjoyed it so much that when I returned from the Denver trip (last year’s Denver trip, not to be confused with this year’s Denver trip), I eagerly hunted the shelves of the local booze outlets hoping to find more, but to no avail.

So I agree with you, that the European and UK tests of photographic copyright are the same, and conform with that adopted in Painer. The critical question in any particular case is whether the subject matter leaves scope for “sufficient formative freedom” which the photographer exploits so as to leave his “mark” on the resulting work. This test seems better captured by the "author's own intellectual creation" formulation than the "skill and labour" one; though in fact UK courts have often expressed the common law originality standard in terms of "skill, labour and judgement", which is arguably not different from the European "author's own intellectual creation" test. And I personally doubt that the EU test requires creativity - it's almost identical to the Canadian test, which was formulated partly so as to underline that creativity is *not* required. (That at least is my memory.)
If we are ever to regain our lands, we need to stop playing the left-right game. Yes, Nationalisation conjures up images of Communism, just as Nationalism is seen as somehow Capitalistic. These labels have been used to divide us, but that is only because we allow ourselves to be divided.
Unlike our mishmash of big-hearted volunteers, the folks working for this group are fundraising professionals. They register their cause as a major sponsor in thousands of races a year, recruiting hordes of runners and volunteers from around the world. If one of its runners raises a certain amount of money, the charity picks up their tab not only for the race entry fee, but often hotel and travel costs. About a year before Thing 1’s juvenile dermatomyositis diagnosis, My Love ran a half marathon in Alaska on behalf of this group. In exchange for her raising $3,000 for their cause, the charity picked up about $1,500 in her expenses, meaning only half the money she raised really went to the cancer cause.

You may recall my field trip in September 2010 when I accompanied a Canada Post Letter Carrier on her 16km route in the Glebe neighborhood of Ottawa. It was a glorious, sunny, autumn day and aside from the fact that I was severely out of shape (making the 14 km walk that day a challenge), the experience was very positive and I thought how wonderful this job would be. The catch was that if I was willing to experience the route in the fall, I had to commit to coming back in the winter months to experience the harsher side of delivering mail.
At an event, be it an author, publisher, or blogger organised event, a blogger meets an author (not the author who's event it is) who's debut will be released in a fair few months time. Blogger and yet-to-be-published author, along with others that are at the event, chat books and everything to do with them. They may chat a little bit online after the event, on Twitter via reviewer & author blogs. As in Situation A, they know each other, they have conversations, and they get on, but aren't the bestest of buddies. When the book is close to being published, the blogger is sent a review copy.
Although I don't know if he exactly understands what it means, Major knows that there is a baby in Mommy's tummy. If you ask him where the baby is, he points to my tummy.

I would say I haven't felt like this since I was a seventeen except that I used to get 3 months off when I was in High School and 8 weeks off in primary. The British education system is a tad stingier with vacation time. Still I'm not going anywhere near this gift-horse's gob. I'm just pleased that my jammies and I can get reacquainted with the daylight hours.

That’s a slab of a tree which has been chopped down in order to study the rings inside, a study referred to as dendrochronology*. Each of these rings represents a specific period of time (oftentimes each ring an individual year), and though I have no idea how the hell to put specific numbers and dates with these rings, there are scientists who can do just that. To a tree, time is gathered in the rings as it grows outward, and I feel there is metaphorical significance which can be observed in this. The rings in the middle are the oldest, and each subsequent circle moving outward embodies a specific period of movement toward the future. The important difference in this illustration, however, is the smaller rings which represent the past are contained within each subsequent ring, so it turns into a series of pasts building upon each other, bleeding into one another, etc.

Actually I wasn’t and the more I thought about it, the more the ending made sense. The whole series was about a group of girls and their negative emotions, so a happy ending was definitely one way to go and the way it was executed was just fine. They all go back to be being normal, they establish solid friendships and carry on happily with their lives. At least there was some tragedy for the main character (the death of Strength), thus satisfying the condition for such a series not having a 100% happy ending where everyone gets to live happily ever after and since there was a lack of interdependence between the characters it was a good ending to resolve it. I might also add that I did find it rather interesting that at the end of a story where women are the one causing each other pain, they all have to simply show love for each other to take away that pain.

Learning from the lessons of the first and, as yet, untasted Lager brew, we used a Cascade tin kit with the addition of 500gm light malt extract and 500gm brewing sugar. Having slightly ( read DOUBLE ) underestimated the total batch volume of the brews we are now well into a feverish quest to provide enough empty bottles to take the second batch before it ferments out. Did I mention that as a result of the type of brew, the temperature and the fact that we added the right amount of sugar, the TWO BREW seems to be fermenting at twice the rate of the first ? Sympathise with us, won’t you, as we attempt to keep ahead of natural forces. Liquid lunches, breakfast beer and four for the road, that sort of thing.

Noticing the awkward optics, Gingrich aides and security personnel swarmed Dillard, trying to intimidate him into moving. One of Gingrich's security agents stepped in front of him. When Dillard didn't budge, the agent lifted his heeled shoe over Dillard's bare foot and dug the back of it into his skin, twisting it side-to-side like he was stomping out a cigarette. Shocked, Dillard kept his ground and took a picture of the agent with his phone, which was quickly knocked out of his hand. Dillard slipped off his flip-flop to pick up the phone with his foot, and a Gingrich supporter kicked the sandal away.

Art is hard work. It can be grueling. Unpleasant. Rewarding, yes, but no less hard than other human endeavors. Inspiration definitely helps us get through that work and make it seem more like fun, but there will be times when inspiration is just not forthcoming, but the project still lays unfinished. During those times we just have to keep plugging away at it, and know that the finished piece will be worth it. If nothing else, you’ll have a finished piece, and that in itself is an accomplishment worth being proud of. Some days I feel discouraged, like my writing is horrible and nothing good will come of it, and I have absolutely no inspiration to cheer me forward despite my efforts. But I know that the inspiration was once there, and that it will most likely be back, so I keep working. It will be worth it.

It’s this patchwork of state laws concerning documentation that hurts trans people everywhere and limits our opportunities to not only vote but to avoid discrimination when looking for a home or a job. What I find interesting about this type of voter suppression is that it’s obviously against everything we stand for as Americans and a society because it oppresses groups of marginalized Americans, telling us through these added barriers to vote, that our voices do not matter and that we do not have a say. It’s sad that the fundamental democratic right to vote and be heard is something trans people have to add to our laundry list of civic duties taken away from us simply because we choose to live our lives most authentically.

While 39% of the homes in the US have at least one dog, there are many more dogs that do not have homes. This book explains why there are too many pets, and what animal shelters, rescue groups, and individuals can do to help. Well-illustrated with heart breaking pictures of rescue dogs, this is a matter-of-fact description of a sad failing of our society. Different animal welfare groups and their work are profiled, and the adoption process is explained. Animal shelter policies, internet resources, and a bibliography are included. At 80 pages, this is just the right size for nonfiction. The downside-- it's hard to read this book without wanting to go to a shelter and bring home another dog, but I don't think that Sylvie would approve!

In this story I'm presented with people who not just have what at first appear to be paranormal abilities, but there are also scientific explanations behind them. Throw in some time travel for good measure and you get a harmonious combination of sci-fi and paranormal elements. There was a consistent level of mystery and suspense throughout the entire book as well as background information and important details being revealed at well-timed intervals so as to further the plot without making it drag. Also included were some excellent twists, a couple of which I saw coming, the thing with Cat, and a few others I so totally didn't, the thing with Jack and with Michael.

Also, there will be a free screening of the highly acclaimed Voices from the Shadows on 24th May at Cineworld Edinburgh (being organised by MESH). For those still in the dark about how appallingly severe this illness can be, this is a welcome wake-up call. It's almost impossible to imagine the hell faced by those at the most disabling end of the spectrum, sufferers - often young people and children - who have virtually no relief, day after day, year after year. My heart breaks for those who are trapped in this unrelenting prison, an invisible prison to many. I hope GPs from all over Lothian come to see this hugely important documentary. And I hope it can also be screened in Glasgow. I know this film will make me weep, but I shall be attending the screening, all being well.

But the magazine also made me deeply thankful that Jesus is in fact God, that he is in fact sinless, and he did take my place for me, not so that I can live happily and pain-free forever – like the Jehovah’s Witnesses like to advertise – but for something far greater and far more meaningful: to restore me to a right relationship with himself.

After World War II, our government did a masterful job at convincing foreign central banks they should have U.S. dollars as their reserves instead of gold bullion. Today, 70% of world central banks have adopted the U.S. dollar as their official reserve currency.

We talked for some time, and I will tell you it was a complete pleasure. Mr Hill is a very nice man. He was very concerned about what had happened. He asked that I tell him my story, which I did. He apologized for the situation, and assured me that it wasn't something that they (as a company) tolerated.

This is my little Italian great-nana's recipe. In standard Italian, it is called pasta e fagioli, which means "pasta and beans". Fasul is the Neopolitan Italian pronunciation.

Hulk Smash Avengers #2 (Marvel) Joe Casey and Max Fiumara, extremely aggressively colored by Jean-Francois Beaulieu, pit a 1970s squad of Avengers against The Hulk, only this time much of the story is devoted to who's joining the team, who's leaving the team, who they would like to join the team, why the people leaving are leaving, and government liaison Henry Gyrich generally grinding The Avengers' gears.

Water is Lesotho’s “white gold,” as Basothos fondly call it. Income from the sale of water from the Lesotho Highlands Water Project is expected to increase with the construction of Metolong Dam and its spin-offs. Under the water project, created in partnership with South Africa, Lesotho exports water to its neighbour’s Gauteng province through a series of dams and tunnels blasted through the mountains. Gauteng, the hub of South Africa’s economy, has little water of its own and therefore needs Lesotho to quench its thirst. As a double benefit, the multi-billion-dollar project also generates enough hydroelectric power to meet about 90 per cent of Lesotho’s energy needs.

All you need to do is leave me a link to your favorite angel pic in the comments below. At the end of the month I will use random.org to pick someone to win an e-copy from Amazon. Also please leave your email address so I have a way to contact you if you win. Following is not required this time, but it is always appreciated! So lets see those links so I can share the pics with everyone! (make sure you leave your comment with a link before 4/30)
And page proofs are double-edged swords. It’s exciting to see the formally laid-out pattern the words make on the page – the story is captured never to be undone – but at the same time this moment of absolute finality is terrifying. There’s not much more you can do about it – a comma might help, italics here and there, a word replaced with something that zings more. With a bit of luck one might even get way with a few inserted sentences – a sleight of hand that is made to appear just as a tweak, lest your editor gets too upset. But basically the novel is all there in print. No more ‘what if’s’.
Although the Rising had been quashed and their leaders executed, Michael Magee*, and many of those who returned to Ireland after their time in English prisons, would continue their work in the shadows until the time to fight the British Empire would once again be right. With the Irish War of Independence, it was time for the Irish to once again assert their right to freedom, and this time they would see victory.

I used Simplicity #2282, a crazy concoction of a dress pattern with some outlandish details to pick and choose from. I chose to make a version that included the peplum (in my opinion, the bestest part of this pattern) and the cap sleeves. Usually I’d be drawn to the puff sleeves, but something about the proportions of the rest of the dress and my fabric choice warned me off from fear of it looking too 1980’s.
After an extended break we bring you Episode 21 of our show, where we discuss Character Transplants. Have you ever wondered what would happen if Star Trek’s Q made a one-shot appearance in Stargate SG-1? That’s the kind of theoretical tomfoolery we are tossing about this time. Plus, Kosh watched Fringe, and we talk about the creepy pink parasite aliens from TNG’s “Conspiracy” and what the Expanded Universe novels did to explain what they really were.
There will be plenty of one-to-one chats and critique time, as well as great group activies and exercises.
Anyway, I will let you all know what the ultrasound shows tomorrow. Please keep those prayers coming.

People need and seek community. In sailing, like fly fishing, like painting, like cycling and so many other pursuits, a mostly independent activity is followed at the end of the day with getting together for drinks, or comparing notes on how the next person did, or building unlikely friendships that end up lasting a very long time based on a common interest. People who like solo activities are anything but loners.
Obedience will not last when the motivation is only the removal of our pain. Obedience only lasts when the motivation is loving devotion. Where are you in your obedience and what is the primary motivation? If it isn’t love, why not tell the Lord you love Him today and want to know Him for who He is and not for what He can do for you.
Please do not get me wrong, I am not going to moan about oil drilling. As with the neighbor running a shooting-parlor in his yard, it is a financial decision made by that neighbor. The neighbor never intended to harm himself or others, and I know this is the case with the oil steadily heading my way. What interests me is the attitude of grief that has fallen over most everyone I run into. Grief in its various stages and accompanied by various coping mechanisms is evident everywhere the talk turns to our Gulf.

RID Optimus Prime is a voyager size toy, now called a “Powerizer”. I think they called it that because of the clear plastic parts incorporated into the Powerizers arms and chests, like the power of energon is flowing through them. And to give them a little credit, it is not too bad an effect for Megatron, as in the cartoon he sometimes glows with dark energon. But for Prime, this does not work at all. The next gimmick is that the weapon included is a very oversize MechTech weapon. It looks completely ridiculous. Prime also comes with a sword, but it is not possible to have him hold it in a cartoon accurate fashion, and it does not look cartoon accurate anyway. If anyone from Hasbro is reading this: this is why those nasty third parties exist! Someone out there is going to make a cartoon accurate set of two swords and two blasters for this or FE Optimus Prime. And every collector will want such a set because Hasbro failed to put a few extra pieces of plastic in the box. Another thing collectors will want is for a Reprolabels set for RID Prime. The paint apps leave a lot to be desired. They have in all the RID releases so far. It is like Hasbro is actively supporting the existence of third parties. Anyway, on to the mold. Primes head is too small, and he has large, flat kibble on his back. Other than that, the toy is not bad. It has a good range of motion and playability, aside from no good weapons. The truck mode is much better. It has side view mirrors and generally looks cool. It is not quite cartoon accurate, but very close. I can’t quite get all the seems to fit together well, though. But with some added paint and/or sticker apps, RID truck mode Prime will look very nice on display.

Sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is an annual plant native to the Americas that possesses a large inflorescence (flowering head). The sunflower got its name from its huge, fiery blooms, whose shape and image is often used to depict the sun. The sunflower has a rough, hairy stem, broad, coarsely toothed, rough leaves and circular heads of flowers. The heads consist of 1,000-2,000 individual flowers joined together by a receptacle base.
The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) fears that we could be talking about the loss of as many as 12,000 jobs, the wholesale closure of countless ticket offices and the creation of hundreds of unmanned station around the fragmented network . Rather than putting their hands up and recognising that rail privatisation failed (New Labour also failed to do this) the Con Dems will try to reduce state involvement by enlarging the private sectors share.
A few Sunday nights ago, something happened in my personal life that really threw me for a loop. I suffered a loss, in a way. There was not a death or a divorce or anything that typically comes to mind at the mention of a loss... but I had to give up something very dear to me, and it tore out a piece of my heart. That is all I can really say about it publicly. The situation has mostly ameliorated itself since then, but at the time, it felt like something I would never be able to get over.
He’s built this whole series of stories apparently without the benefit of a 7th grade class on story structure. That’s impressive.

The concept of fairies is based on the fae of medieval Western European (Old French) folklore and romance. Fairies are often identified with a variety of beings of other mythologies. Even in folklore that uses the term "fairy," there are many definitions of what constitutes a fairy. Sometimes the term is used to describe any magical creature, including goblins or gnomes: at other times, the term only describes a specific type of more ethereal creature.
When The Spinners on Brownlow Way was completed in 1974 it was effectively a replacement for a number of pubs that had been swept away in slum clearances that saw row upon row of terraced houses demolished and new social housing built in their place.

As Greybeard and his wife Martha move down the Thames River from the ruins of Oxford in an attempt to reach the sea, they encounter not just the empty reminders of what was lost, but oddly enough, signs that perhaps there are still fertile humans. Yet this discovery does not enliven them with hope. No, rather it makes no difference to Greybeard's generation, other than these half-feral upstarts are a disturbance to them and a threat to the quiet dissolution that so many of them seek.

A wonderful dinner at a tiny Italian restaurant, walking around Times Square.. enjoying the craziness of the city, trying to maneuver through the subways, seeing the Yankees IN Yankee stadium.

I recently read the following quote by Pres. Thomas S. Monson on another blog of a family dealing with cancer too: “Time is a gift, a treasure not to be put aside for the future but to be used wisely in the present.” Ryan and I have discussed at length how to create more meaningful relationships and memories as a family. We want to make each day count. Taking the idea from this other blog, I planned a Family Home Evening lesson last week on this topic, Make Today Count. We discussed and listed many things we can do as a family each day to make the days better. Some things are daily activities such as family prayer and scripture study, speaking kindly, serving one another, saying “I love you” often, and giving lots of hugs. Other things are activities we want to increase like going to the beach, family bike rides, playing board games. Some things are easy and are already part of our regular routine, but others will take daily reminders. Our hope is to strengthen our family through this trial. We know good comes from adversity, but it’s not always immediate or automatic. All things worthwhile take hard work and patience. But at the end of each day, no matter how stressed we feel, how cranky the boys are, or how physically and emotionally exhausted we are, I hope we love each other a little more because we made today count.

The publishing world is a business and in all areas of business, there has to be a basic professionalism, a standard, and fair play for all, publisher as well as author. While an author might expect much of a publisher, the author must always be informed and not fall upon the sword of ignorance or naivety. Any publisher shown in anything but a fair and descent light is not good for them or the publishing business as a whole. We all have a right of reply, to be shown in a fair light, criticism accepted, but with balance. In being a business or offering a service, we also have a duty and obligation to strive for the highest standard we can in whatever field we choose to ply our service or trade.

If you have the guts, you tell your editors about this handicap/blessing, you gather your facts from as many sides as possible and your story takes shape.

No, not like I don't believe in eternity. I just no longer believe it starts when you die. There is this idea in the church and the Bible that Jesus came to give us eternal life. This means that when your heart stops pumping blood, your soul can keep on going in the presence of God. This idea is central to the Biblical narrative. However, what is not central is the idea that this begins at death. I think Jesus came to give us LIFE and life to the fullest. NOT only when one dies. But TODAY.

Iodine deficiency Fortification of salt with iodine occurred in 1924 when we were experiencing an epidemic of “goiters” or enlarged thyroid glands. Thyroids become enlarged in an effort to absorb more iodine from the bloodstream. Besides hypothyroidism and goiters, iodine deficiencies have been linked to mental retardation and neurodevelopmental disorders in children, mental and physical impairment in adults, increased risk of thyroid cancer, and some research suggests that there may be a link between iodine deficiency and fibrocystic breast disease.

Lately, I’ve noticed how much I love working with writers in the newsroom. With their writing in particular, and it suddenly struck me how jealous I was of our professor, Larry. He gets good, consistent pay (and tenure, eventually) to be the head of a newspaper with very little risk. As a student paper, we can get things wrong and just shrug and say “We learning!” and for him, all the blame falls on me as the student EIC, because it is my job to make sure the paper gets produced and his job to help us if we go to him for help and to guide us to the right answers. If he doesn’t know the answer, we figure it out together. I would LOOOOOOOVE to nurture journalism. Of course, there’s the pesky teaching of classes and all the things that come with teaching, like lesson plans, grading and the like…but that comes with the territory.

Even as I felt sorry for Lena, I was thankful my son was alive and nursing. He is such a joy. Lena’s grief must be affecting her mind, to make up such a story as she’s telling, that it was my child that was dead and I am now holding her child.
The Nick Fury subplot ends with Nick coming out of a meeting with the World Security Council. He gets dressed down a bit and Hill wants to know what happens next, and Fury says the Avengers will be there when the world needs them. Again, Hill absorbs the answer and walks back into the operations center of the Helicarrier bridge. Maybe she didn’t get the answer she wanted, but she got the only answer she needed, so while Fury gets one final pose to look cool, Hill goes back to work.

Apart from the stitch I got in my side (this is a side affect that I have noticed before, when I try to do physical activity without being properly hydrated), by the fourth running segment, I starting feeling a pain in my shins. I tried to shrug it off, no big deal, pains come and go all the time. But, as you can see from my times listed below, during the fifth shift of running, it was too bad to ignore. A pain unlike any I had felt before. It wasn’t muscle pain, or fatigue, but rather a dull ache right down in my bones. This pain was present in both legs. It was so bad that I had trouble driving home.
Midnight Beckoning offers a particular situation I have a soft spot for…love triangles. Temptation is a true test and when the chemistry is there as well as good intentions, it’s so much fun to see what fate decides for the hero and heroine.

There is an old Wall Street saying, “sell in May and go away”. Over the past two years this theory has worked VERY well. Had one sold on the first trading day in May and done nothing until September/October in both 2010 and 2011, one would have avoided some big market slides and a lot of volatility. So the big question is will “sell in May and go away” work for the third year in a row? Seems too predictable so I decided to go back to the beginning of the secular bear market in 2000 and see how well “sell in May and go away” has worked. What I found is that a better way to view things is that March/April seem to be a major turning point for the market every single year. Let me run through each year and you will understand where I am coming from. I will be using the S&P 500 as my barometer and one must take into account the cyclical trend heading into each year.
You have your FREE-WILL movements, RE-direct those and TAKE AWAY from the draining energy flow of AGAINST the salts or ways of another. Let them be! Take your beautious Life Force Energy in your movement and HELP and form together those that are upon your same stage of growth….or the very “cause” of what you move for or towards. Via may it be homelessness/hungar/unemployments….etc…we know the list here Chelas dont we? What I AM suggesting to you is to CHANGE your “thought/vibrational feelings and directional flows of that pure energy and apply it DIRECTLY to your “CAUSE” thru by doing of such you will more of an immediate see the “EFFECT” of that energy exchange within this group of cycled energies.
The Monster escapes from Frankenstein twice before he is ultimately destroyed by falling into a vat of acid. One has to wonder if it was the real monster, however, since Frankenstein murders his maid who wants her to marry him because she is carrying his child and threatens to go to the police an tell all about his experiments if he does not. It is for her murder he winds up in jail, set to be executed.

This photo was taken today as part of a MAC cosmetics promotion at Bloomindales, San Francisco. It was part of an impressive marketing event for a new Mac line of cosmetics called “Wonder Woman.” If I had to guess, I would say that MAC and possibly the entire cosmetics industry, is one of the few that has been spared in this economic crisis. Seriously, this event dripped of money. There were gorgeous highly produced environment graphics, multiple make up stations, glamorous models in wonder women costumes, and several i-phone camera opps.
I have decided I need a new camera. My old Fuji seems to have died after number of years of excellent service. It was ‘only’ 8megapixels, but I got loads of really good shots with it. I am most likely camping/beaching with my friends this summer, so I’ll need one by then.

Today, I woke up at noon. Something I never do, because I think sleeping away at least four hours of your life in the morning, when you could be doing something productive, is a waste. When you could just do that sleeping at night instead of staring into space and letting thoughts eat at your brain. But I guess that's hypocritical of me to say, because that's exactly what I do. Oh well.

According to branding expert Ron Strauss who with Bill Neal co-wrote the book Value Creation: The Power of Brand Equity and who recently spoke at the October Reno-Tahoe American Marketing Association luncheon, 83% of a company’s market value today is represented by their intangible assets (brands, quality processes, relationships, etc.) compared to 1975, when it stood at only 17%. Part of this shift in value from tangible to intangible can be traced to the information age: we’ve become less dependent on tangible, industrialized goods and more desirous of products and services that we can trust and that make us feel good. According to Strauss, building brand equity is the key component for driving sustainable and profitable growth:

I eyed the rubber gloves cautiously and then realized she/he was probably just going to check how well I’m hanging. Sure enough, she/he said to lower my drawers and turn my head to the side. Cool, I can handle it if she/he can; haha. But then I noticed she/he put a box of tissues on the exam table. I knew this was a legit doctors’ office and that happy endings are not part of the physical so this couldn’t be for that kind of cleanup.

If only they had done an award for the male and female in each age group Teal would have gotten an award!! This race brings a new PR for Beth! We are both so proud of how we did especially considering Beth’s previous PR and Teal’s PR was from an all out flat course. We definitely gave it our all and owned those hills instead of letting them own us! You should definitely consider signing up for this race next year! Just a fun atmosphere with everyone dressed up in their Superhero costumes! They had everything from Quail Man (who remembers him??) to generic superheroes to Wonder Woman. Lots of great costumes out there!

Cool and hot,
Born in Moneyglass, Co Antrim, Northern Ireland on May 4, 1974, 16-time champion A P (Tony) McCoy is the greatest jump jockey of his era and many would argue of all time. He is the son of Peadar McCoy, who bred the 1993 County Hurdle victor Thumbs Up. McCoy started out with Billy Rock, riding out from the age of 12, before trying his luck as a Flat jockey with Jim Bolger and rode his first winner on Legal Steps at Thurles on March 26, 1992. Since growing too heavy and turning to jump racing, he has not looked back. He partnered his first British winner, Chickabiddy, at Exeter on September 7, 1994 and was champion conditional rider in Britain in 1994/5 with a then record 74 winners when attached to Toby Balding’s Hampshire yard. He took his first senior title the following season with 174 wins. His domination has brought 16 consecutive jump jockey’s titles and he is currently well on course for number 17 this season. McCoy broke Peter Scudamore’s record of 221 wins in the 1997/8 season with 253 successes and broke his own record for the fastest 200 winners in the 1999/2000 season, ending up with 245 successes. In 2001/02 he beat by 20 the record of 269 winners in any season set by Flat jockey Sir Gordon Richards. He has passed the double century mark five times and reached the 3,000 winner mark at Plumpton in February, 2009. He had a fairytale 1997 Cheltenham Festival, recording a rare double on Make A Stand for his then boss Martin Pipe in the Champion Hurdle and Mr Mulligan in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. McCoy added a second Champion Hurdle when successful on Brave Inca in 2006 and a third in 2010 with Binocular. In total, he has partnered 27 winners at The Festival and won the Betfred Cheltenham Gold Cup for the second time in 2012 on Synchronised. In April, 2004, he left Martin Pipe’s stable after accepting a reportedly huge retainer from J P McManus and rides for the owner’s principal trainer in Britain, Jonjo O’Neill. He scored a long-awaited victory in the Grand National aboard Don’t Push It in 2010, his 15th ride in the race. That win helped towards him being crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year that December. McCoy also rides regularly for Nicky Henderson. His wife Chanelle gave birth to their daughter Eve late in 2007. McCoy was made an MBE in the 2003 Queen’s Birthday Honours List and his achievements were recognised with a reception at Stormont, the seat of government in Northern Ireland, in August, 2009. In the 2010 Birthday Honours List he was made an OBE. John Smith’s Grand National Record: 1995 Chatam (Fell 12th), 1996 Deep Bramble (PU bef 2 out); 1998 Challenger Du Luc (Fell 1st); 1999
Regardless, its great to see the Serbian government paying attention to this issue and ostensibly moving forward towards a solution.
The concept behind virtual reality is not new, of course. While most people trace its origins to Morton Heilig’s 1956 Sensorama machine (which combined video, audio, and sensory experiences such as smell and touch), others go back as far as the 1860s and 360 degree panoramic murals. Heilig though is clearly the progenitor of our modern conception of virtual reality, in 1962 patenting an idea for a device very similar to what we now call a Head Mounted Display (HMD). Virtual Reality’s origins come together in the pioneering work of the 1980s and 1990s.

So here is a list of essentials that you need to email yourself, hand over to your maid of honor and/or print out and keep in your wallet. It’s pretty basic and when you read them you may even think ‘well of course I’ll remember this’. But trust me, darlings, the tricky part will be making sure you remember them at a time when the soul sucking madness of your wedding is eating at your common sense, and panic, stress and nerves cloud over your otherwise rational brain cells. That’s when you will definitely need this list!

Goatvomit are an obscure black metal band from Greece that sing about destroying Christianity with nuclear missiles.

In March 2010 Global Financial Integrity (GFI), a Washington based anti corruption group published a report titled “Illicit Financial Flows from Africa: Hidden Resource for Development”. The report estimated that between 1970 and 2008 Africa lost about $854 billion through trade mispricing. The GFI report added that the figure of the illicit financial outflows could have gone as high as 1.8 trillion dollars if components such as mispricing of services and smuggling had been included.

The singleplayer campaign is short but sweet – clocking in at just over 8 and a half hours on medium. I found medium to be more than difficult enough for me but that’s down to personal preference.

I have to admit...yellow is not one of my favorite colors. GASP!! But I also have to admit that this layout is one of my favorites that I've ever made. And it wasn't even for me!

As per one of the variants of their collective memories, fire was created when God Puluga made the sun sit on a heap of sticks, after which he sent the sun back into the sky. ”The Andamanese could not make fire themselves but had to nurse it carefully in special containers they carried around with them on their frequent wanderings. If the fire was allowed to go out through carelessness or accident, a new flame had to be sought from a friendly neighbouring sect or a natural fire caused by lightning had to be awaited.” This reminds me of the nityagnihotram custom.

The theist has an easy time explaining the notion of our cognitive equipment’s functioning properly: our cognitive equipment functions properly when it functions in the way God designed it to function. The atheist evidential objector, however, owes us an account of this notion. What does he mean when he complains that the theist without evidence displays a cognitive defect of some sort? How does he understand the notion of cognitive malfunction?

Creative grandparents enjoy their grandchildren, not merely endure them. Creative grandparents look into the eyes of their grandchildren, connect with them, see the love in their eyes, and respond to that love with a greater love. Creative grandparents walk with them, hand in hand through life, in good times and in tough times. Creative grandparents experience the great joy of having their grandchildren look up at them and say, “I just love to be with you, Grandpa.” Creative grandparents thank God for their grandchildren and for their relationship with them each and every day, leading grandparents to wonder what they could possibly have done to be so privileged. Kornhaber and Woodward in Grandparents/ Grandchildren call this relationship “the vital connection . . . second only in emotional power to the parent-child bond.”

Ready Player One, however, rather than showing us the differences between real and virtual world in 2044, focuses on the gaming aspect of the OASIS. When James Halliday, the inventor of the OASIS died, he left the World with one final ultimate game: the search for Halliday’s Easter Egg within the OASIS. The person to find the Egg would inherit his entire fortune. This last will and testimony of the 1980s nut Halliday gave rise to a new generation of OASIS gamers, the ‘gunters’ whose sole mission in life is to find the Egg. Wade Watts, an orphan forced to live with an uncaring aunt, has devoted his entire life to learning about Halliday’s obsessions and finding this OASIS holy grail. To do this, ‘gunters’ have to find 3 Keys, which will unlock 3 Gates which, once proven your worth, will finally lead to the Egg… if all of this reads like a video game, then you’re right, because Ready Player One is basically the book version of playing a video game: going on a quest for the ultimate prize, proving your worth, fighting opponents, picking up prizes, forging alliances… it’s like a videogame Dungeons and Dragons but then with multibillions at stake.
Today I got my eyebrows and face waxed- so I look all pretty and girly. I already have my yellow ribbons to hang up outside. I need to get my nails did, drop the dogs off at their spa getaway, pick up balloons to tie up out front, pick up a few more groceries, finish laundry, finish wrapping welcome home/Christmas in June gifts, new sheets on the bed but I don't want to do that until the day of or day before, hanging all the decorations, oh, and making sure I get there on time!
A few days ago, on the morning following the big rain, I sat over my first cup of coffee at the old harvest table in our east facing kitchen thinking about bees and pussy willows and the riches of the farm. The field across the lane began to slowly reveal itself as daylight crept down the hill. Inch by inch, the first rays of sun ignited the billions of drops clinging to the tips of the new green grass. I took my coffee out onto the porch and slowly, decadently inhaled in the damp, cool, rain cleansed air. You could almost hear plants stretching and leaves unfolding. Three does suddenly hopped from the woods over the old stone wall half way up the field. Two were yearlings and the larger doe appeared to be heavy with this year’s fawns. As though enjoying the new wet earth, the young ones raced each other up the hill and back down over the glistening, spring green carpet, white tails erect with excitement and joy. C.S. Lewis wrote that “Joy is the serious business of heaven.” With the death of the dry spell and the new life of spring, I, too, felt Surprised by Joy.
If it weren't for Alera, I would Special Shelf this book. Cayla Kluver may take a while to tell her story, but what a story it is! That surprise twist in the latter half was fantastic. And the men.

Dear God–I really don’t think I have time for this today! I am supposed to be at the homeless shelter at 10:30. I think I have to call out because of the explosive poo. I think I am also supposed to have everyone ready by 5 pm to go out with MOH and some clients. Please God, let explosive poo be enough to get me out of that? Not that I don’t want to go, one less thing to MAKE happen, is still one less thing at this point. Especially NOW that we have a poo issue.

There was bare-minimum language, very little for a film completely in the soldier's world. Early on someone calls the outpost in Britain a sh-thole, and the rest of the language was mainly p-ss, which, considering the meaning of the word, was actually used appropriately and not as a swear word.

The visual feel for this one is sort of a blend between traditional comics (reminds me just a little of some of the '90s Sandman art) and a more informal, fun, cartoon-y, funny-papers style. Anyway, it works, and the extra covers and concept art at the end were enjoyable.

Next I finished up the rear Targa roof seal by installing the “rosettes” that secure the seal around the rear Targa pin locator, resulting in a cleaner, finished look. At the same time, I took advantage of the heat (soooo nice) and peeling the dash leather cover off. Over the years the sun had curled it up around the edges and causing it to be an eyesore. It came of relatively easy but then the real work came. Some one was “glue happy” (obviously smelling it a little too much before starting) and it took 2 hours of scraping, swearing and adhesive remover to clean the glue off. Now it is time to have a new one made…maybe something with a contrasting stitching?

Pours medium to pale caramel color with garnet highlights and displays a tan crown that dissipates quickly. Pleasantly sweet aroma of roasted nuttiness and a soft fruitiness. Rustic bread crust, roasted pecans, maple syrup, and light caramel along with balanced hop bitterness help round out the flavor profile. Not much carbonation and a medium bodied mouthfeel. An outstanding ale that is amazingly drinkable. When in Oxford, Mississippi, head to Murff’s and get a pint of this brew with a Muff Burger and fried egg.
"Ground us." Jashi's voice held steady despite the hundreds of feet of air between them and the ground. Technically, it was Pevan's call to bring the jumping to an end, but the Warder was right. If the Wildhawk didn't turn back towards Federas, there was nothing more they could do. She gritted her teeth as she turned them over for the descent again. Fat chance the Wilder would leave the town alone, but it wasn't worth risking the peace to pre-empt it.

Hi all, I bet you thought that I fell off the face of the earth...lol...(it kind of feels like it ),. but here I am. The big wedding was last weekend so I have been gone (off the computer for almost a week). I was the hostess this month for the calendar girls. I love to make cards but struggled with a theme...sigh...so here is what I came up with...Make a card showing an upcoming event that is happening this summer and explain it when posting the card...the "extra" was to send the card to either a service member or a shut in since June falls in between Memorial Day and 4th of July....Well as you will see shortly.... I struggled with my card as well...not only am I LATE...in posting but my card did not turn out like my pea brain had imagined it would...sigh...oh well at least I have it finally done and I promise to do better next month....
My son said bananas and edamame (not sure that soy beans are in the veggie category- but at least their green!) The doctor seemed pleased with the kids' eating habits, but still emphasized that they should limit the amount of sugary snacks and sweets they eat.
I learned loads about quilting on a large scale while making this quilt. Circles especially are far easier to stitch if you mark the outline first. It's very difficult to see your way around a 7 inch circle and be able to freehand stitch it, so for the largest circles I'd stop and quickly draw the outline before stitching it.
These kinds of 1930s musicals were designed to take people away from the dreariness of the real world going on outside the movie theater during the Great Depression, presenting them with gorgeous people moving gracefully through an elegant world, the cares of everyday life of no relevance to them. Unlike our modern audiences, which seek to wallow in misery when times are down, these were people who sought the blissful escape that entertainent could provide. And Top Hat gave it to them, in spades.

After much testing, the people of Momokawa felt that the water of Oregon most closely resembled the water they used in Japan. Many areas in Oregon, including Portland, are supposed to have very pure drinking water, which would help produce a better quality sake. In addition, the brewery's water goes through several filtration levels, to remove all unwanted materials, chemicals and microbes. It is said that sake is about 80% water so the quality of that water is extremely important.

I realize that I can strive for all of these things but if I miss some along the way, it doesn’t mean I’ve failed. I remember that my life is a collection of days and I will not be judged by one specific day. I understand that I can’t do everything for everyone every single day. I am just a person and no one expects me to be perfect. Or if they do, they’re going to be disappointed.

As I politely waited with my shopping basket for several indecisive ladies to decide which way to move in order to clear space for me to pass, I heard one old lady tell another (less observant or less mobile) lady, "we need to move to let her pass," giving me a smile. Yay! Maybe once I do go public I won't stand out as much as I fear I will. Who knows? Now, it is quite possible her eyesight was failing her, but even so, I don't consider my general blurry shape to be very feminine at all. I certainly have to hips, and even in a tight T-shirt I only barely have boobs, which this time were mostly covered by a shapeless oversized unisex fleece jacket anyway. In other words, in a situation where I had no reason whatsoever to be recognized as a "her", I was.

Things move slowly in Panama. Case in point: the air conditioner in the living room blew and my brother-in-law made arrangements to get it fixed last Saturday. Last Saturday the repairman called and said he'd be by this morning. He hasn't arrived yet. We all have air conditioning in our bedrooms so sleeping's no problem but boy it's hot in that room during the day! You might just as well spend your time on the balcony.

Last season The Vampire Diaries continued its trend of blowing my mind on a weekly basis. Evil vampire-werewolf hybrid Klaus wreaked havoc on Mystic Falls and closed out the season taking hero Stefan under his blood-guzzling, people-eating wing. We left off with one hell of a body count, with Jenna, Uncle/Daddy Jon, Isobel and Jeremy all shedding their mortal coils.

St. Patrick’s Day has taken the same road as Christmas. Many of the people who celebrate it aren’t Irish (although as one of my facebook friends pointed out, St. Patrick wasn’t even Irish). Christmas is a Christian holiday to celebrate the birth of our Savior. Many who celebrate it aren’t even Christian. During the Christmas season Christians and non-Christians alike spend lots of money on each other, visit family, spread seasonal cheer, watch parades and, of course, drink beer at parties. St. Patrick’s day is all of those as well – except maybe the first three.

Sinclair’s team starts dying out quickly so you don’t have to bother learning their names, and to the film’s credit, Sinclair is captured by the marauders in this first encounter. She’s taken to their stronghold, where Sol (Craig Conway) beats her up a bit and then tells her she’s their ticket out. Kane has told everyone that there’s nothing left alive in the outside world, but Sol doesn’t believe him. After he does his crazy man routine on Eden, he goes outside where they roast (literally) Dr. Talbot (Sean Pertwee) alive, and then carve him up like Sunday dinner and eat him.

Eliminate self-pity. Watch for responses such as “It’s not fair!” or “Why me?” when things don’t go well. Those reactions often reflect an attitude of entitlement that is common in our society. Consider instead that some of these situations are a gift, not a punishment.
Prof. Lindzen is well able to defend himself but I would like to note just one thing that throws all the Warmist criticisms into a cocked hat: The effect of clouds. It is undoubted that cloudiness correlates with warming but does that cause warming to accumulate or do clouds shelter the earth and hence lead to subsequent cooling? Do clouds provide a positive or a negative feedback? And answering that is absolutely crucial. Because it is only a postulated accumulation of warming from clouds that allows Warmists to claim that future warming will deviate from its present trivial trend.

Additionally, my aunt is continuing to recover very well. I appreciate all of your kind words over the weekend. As a blogger, it can be scary to open yourself up in such an honest way, particularly about something that is tough.

I couldn’t completely abandon the project, though, because Granota knew I was making it. Silly me, I had made a big deal about the yarn when I bought it because it was called “Cuddle Muffin,” which was her nickname as a baby. I tried to convince her that maybe a sweater would be nice to have instead of a jumper (pinafore, UK readers). No dice. She asks me everyday, “Are you done with my Cuddle Muffin dress yet?” And if she sees me crocheting anything else (which is merely for my own sanity’s sake), she demands to know, “Why aren’t you making my Cuddle Muffin dress?!” Tiny tyrant!

Yesterday was a very important day - not only will it go down in history as the day that Gwan kindly took me on the "Super Best Tour Ever of Tours", but it was also the day after the presidential elections in France. Riding the metro to Gare Montparnasse in the morning, I studied the faces of my fellow passengers, most of whom were reading newspaper articles about President-elect François Hollande, to determine how they felt about the results. If they looked pleased, I wondered if lived in the 20th arrondissement, where 71.83% of the residents voted for Hollande. If they appeared worried, I speculated that perhaps they were my neighbors in the 16th arrondissement, where Nicholas Sarkozy received 78.01% of the vote. Never had I felt myself to be more of an outsider in Paris.
By watching your negative/bad thoughts that arise in your mind, without judging yourself, the thoughts move away from you like a cloud. What remains after that is a shining goodness. You can be a great person performing good deeds and helping people and all that, but it is useless if there are bad thoughts in you that you haven’t let go. They grow in you, in the back of your mind, suppressed and one day when Ram is sleeping, they rise in you with all its powers and bring out the Ten headed monstrous Ravan from you. Ram is needed here in all his greatness to slay this suppressed Ravan.

Yes, "sharing" has changed quite a bit from what it was six years ago. Somebody else might post every "Prisoner" soundtrack album. Over here, and not in FLAC, is the fairly obscure original "Prisoner" theme. A "share" that's more like jaywalking than attempted murder.
Well if this is the case Mr Price seems to be extremely naive. I doubt if there is any advertisement in the world that uses real people. The actors unions would be up in arms.

I decided to use Martini Nikki as I haven't inked her up for a while.

Quick, in what year is this movie set? Hard isn’t it? Could be 1927, could be forty years later. It is 1959, Welton’s centennial. 1959 is an interesting choice; a few years earlier and the 1960s, which Keating some sort of harbinger of, would seem too far away. A few years later, and the boys’ initial conformity would seem unbelievably square. So really, this is a story that seems sort of out of time, but really it’s hard to imagine it happening in any other year.

At one time or another, I ran each of the dungeons featured. Borshak’s Lair, The Pharoah’s Tomb, Merlin’s Garden, etc. Actually, I ran most after the Dungeoneer Compendium came out and collected the dungeons of the first six issues. That great book not only contained all those dungeons, but also placed them all on the land map of Jaquays’ great Night of the Walking Wet setting. All those places, and more, were right there in the Castle Krake area, and I used that to my advantage.

We've also discussed how your character has an external struggle that she needs to overcome. But she should also have an internal conflict that needs to reconciled as well. As the story progresses and the challenges escalate, the consequences for not solving them should become more dire, which causes the reader to become more emotionally engaged.
You may also want to add a recipe card box or book to your registry and ask your mom, his and grandmothers to share their favorite recipes with you.

“An educated voter is the most dangerous person to any politician. Most Americans are lazy when it comes to being informed about issues that impact their daily lives. But, yet these same voters who claim they don’t have time to keep informed of the issues; know when Beyoncé has a baby or when Lady Gaga does something stupid like wears a dress made of meat! We have to be what we are looking for.”
The answer, of course, is her cat. The kitten is her familiar, the symbol of her love and fidelity (note how her pussy refuses to play with Holly Martins) which she subconsciously sends out into the night to nuzzle the feet of her lover, play with his shoelace (paging Doctor Freud!) and gaze up at him in wide-eyed adoration. Throughout her conversation with Martins in that scene, her cat is otherwise engaged. That there is, in reality, more than one kitten involved, only emphasises the singularity of her purpose; there may be a multiplicity of cats, but they are all performing in concert, acting out her wishes and desires, leading us to the man she loves.

After the doctors had left the room, Alex came close to me, and I cuddled Toby in my arms and gave him his first feed. He latched right on to the breast, and it was so cozy and intimate. I felt such overwhelming waves of love, and everything felt perfect and wonderful. The way our bodies work is so amazing; your body grows a baby (a baby!), delivers it and then feeds it with milk. I also have such great newfound respect for all mothers for bringing their babies into the world, and for babies for doing such a great job being alive.

Mr. Helm gave his drums a muffled, bottom-heavy sound that placed them in the foundation of the arrangements, and his tom-toms were tuned so that their pitch would bend downward as the tone faded. But his playing didn’t call attention to himself. Three bass-drum thumps at the beginning of one of the Band’s anthems, “The Weight,“ were all that he needed to establish the song’s gravity. His playing served the song. In “The Shape I’m In," he juxtaposed Memphis soul, New Orleans rumba and military tattoo. But though it was tersely responsive to the music, the drumming also had an improvisational feel.
Funny to think of it, until now people cannot get over the nora-vilma tandem when it comes to their field of being artists. As a result, the new move to proclaim someone as a national artist is obviously a move to retain the said tandem in a way. I am no Vilma fan, I’ve seen her movies and I don’t really give her claps. However, mother tells me that she appreciates Vilma’s acting, and that she’s one of the pillars of the Philippine entertainment industry.

As an opening episode went, it set everything up nicely for Smash. The characters aren't particularly well defined just yet (the gay characters in Tom and Ellis are walking cliches and Derek is nowhere near as intimidating as the show tries to imply) but there's potential and while being a Broadway based show will not be enough to stop people comparing it to Glee, I have to admit, I'll be sticking with the show for the time being and with a second season already commissioned, it's certainly going to have enough time to really stand out. At least worth giving a glance at. Not quite addictive but maybe, just maybe it might be someday. Oh and I'm linking two of the standout numbers from the first episode as well.
In my UK edition there was a short story, “Anger Management” set between Bite Club and Last Breath from Shane’s POV, detailing Shane’s mandatory counselling with Dr. Theo Goldman, where he’s challenged to refrain from becoming angry and use non-violent methods whenever possible for 24 hours. It’s not a necessary read but it was enjoyable, especially his encounter with Monica.
I took a drive to Chesapeake City today and snapped this photo of the bridge I traveled over for ten years when we lived ‘below the canal’ on the horse farm. The bridge is very high and traverses the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal (the C&D Canal), a shipping lane for cargo ships. The waterway is a shortcut from the Delaware River to the head of the Chesapeake Bay.

I was inspired by all the tucking I saw going on at Kayla's 21 Day Challenge, so I tried the half-tuck today.

She's so distracted, she can't even tuck in her shirt properly."

Wars seem to define decades more than anything. Sure a politician may have a lot to do with particular wars, such as George Bush in Iraq, but wars often do not stop with the transition of power. If you look down through the twentieth century, we see war after war, conflict after conflict, and if there’s very little conflict then there’s probably outright conquest. Stretching through the decades, wars and conflict have featured throughout and they define our decades with chapters in history books, each one an individual mark on our conscience for every time we forget and fail to learn from the mistakes society has made over and over again.

Well, now I know that I am driven, like tangible results and progress and financial independence… and don’t need a career to fulfil these things.

Fail One: Do we or do we not have a reservation? I arrived at 7:30 to meet some friends, and I was told that even though we had a reservation, we don't. Apparently, they don't take reservations for more than one party of six, and there was already one reservation for a party of six. I'm really confused at this point. My friend, Michelle, had made the reservation knowing that a typical wait would be two hours or more. Someone could have told her that there would not be a table for us even though there was a six top table set up and waiting (not for us though). The hostess did tell us that we would have the next table that was big enough for a party of six and pointed to two tables in the corner. We watched as the table was cleaned and pushed together. Then we watched as the hostess seated another party at that said table while the first six top table remained open. We were seated at a tiny, barely big enough for four table squished near the door at 8:05 pm. All the while, the original six top table remained open until 8:20pm. We were later told that the other reservation of six failed to show up so they gave the table away to a walk up.

In his St. George’s Day address of 1933 Churchill warned of the types who were then taking over our political and intellectual life: “The worst difficulties from which we suffer do not come from without. They come from within. They do not come from the cottages of the wage earners. They come from a peculiar type of brainy people always found in our country who, if they add something to the culture, take much from its strength. Our difficulties come from the mood of unwarrantable self-abasement into which we have been cast by a powerful section of our own intellectuals. They come from the acceptance of defeatist doctrines by a large portion of our politicians. But what have they to offer but a vague internationalism, a squalid materialism, and the promise of impossible utopias?" A tribute to the Royal Marines in 1936 showed his piety to our history: “Those who do not think of the future are unworthy of their ancestors” .
I love not being sick. One of life's simple pleasure's. Felt so good today I went on a walk with the kids.

Just to please you, some hints: it will feature a bookshop where not everything is as it at first seems. It will have a leading lady that suffers from an over-exuberant family. There will probably be some romantic elements. There will be some laughs and lots of surprises. And I really cannot tell you more. Why?

Let's look at Batman as an example of effective short-form promotion. (Doesn't everyone?) When the movie The Dark Knight was about to come out, the studio knew they had a bundle of Hollywood hotness on their hands, and even before the trailers they had to get that across in the simplest of teasers: still images on posters, in print, and on the web. Hence the "Why so serious?" campaign.

At second Vespers the antiphons Ego plantavi etc are sung again with the psalms from Second Vespers of Apostles (Pss. 109, 112, 115, 125 & 138). The hymn is Egregie Doctor, Paule. After the collect of the feast commemorations are sung first of St. Peter and then of the following Office of St. Polycarp. At Compline the Sunday psalms are sung.
There’s a history behind this. Certain atheists in the mid-twentieth century were promoting the so-called “presumption of atheism.” At face value, this would appear to be the claim that in the absence of evidence for the existence of God, we should presume that God does not exist. Atheism is a sort of default position, and the theist bears a special burden of proof with regard to his belief that God exists.

Some details: I frosted the cupcakes using a Wilton 6B decorating tip and a large coupler. I got the cute cupcake liners from this online Esty shop. The liners were said to be greaseproof, but maybe 1 1/2 cups of oil was too much for even greaseproof liners.

Best part about this recipe? The frozen berries. We almost always have a bag of Trader Joe’s frozen berries in our freezer. Blueberries, blackberries, raspberries. In the past, I’ve tried using frozen berries instead of fresh berries in baking… not good. I guess the trick is not defrosting them. When you mix the berries in, the batter turns into this weird, purple-gray color. Not the most appetizing, but that color disappears once you bake them. (That yucky color is the reason I didn’t take any photos.)

This might be another more classy outfit but as I was posting the pictures of my walk in Mayfair yesterday, I thought about going for a similar one again. Well, maybe similar just in the fashion"genre" of my choice but then again different (see how essay-meets-uni-anti-/un-/non-creativity is taking over my creative head - a real drama). Black and white? Always the right choice. Whenever, wherever you are! Houndstooth? A pattern as timeless as checks and something that always fits.
Paul Harrison – Catch Me When You Can
Usually, when I style for a client, I do all the shopping and returns. I schlep everything to my client's home and schlep everything back that doesn't end up getting used. I had the luxury of sending Rachel on her own shopping excursion. She sent me photos of the spaces she wanted to get photos of, and I directed her to specific items in specific styles and colors. It was a little difficult to give up shopping control, because a lot of times I just don't know what will work until I see it. But Rachel did a great job. And I was not sad to miss out on making returns (my most un-favorite part of styling gigs.)

There’s no reasonable way that this is a good development for a free society. There is no realistic vision of the future in which this will not lead to appalling mischief. Like my aunt and uncle, the people who trust in the democratizing effect of the Internet are not evil or stupid. They sincerely believe that the web has given us more control. They sincerely believe the consumer is in charge.

You get to go leave and hit on other people and convince yourself you are awesome. You don’t have to see that. You get older and you don’t think this way, people’s lives and hearts mean more to you. That said, HUNGER GAMES BITCH.
People thought of me as arrogant and often told me so in high-school, but honestly I never knew what my problem was, and it has taken me a lifetime to even recover a little social perspective, and what I should do about my social problems. I don’t feel any hostility toward these people who never gave me any support; it was my own personal misbehavior which was driving it away. I have decades long friends who have similar problems.

The music keeps up the frenetic pace throughout the album, with only a few times where the band slows things down. Even those rare occurrences retain a dark and evil atmosphere. While the band is not really innovative, they understand their craft well enough that they produce a pretty decent overall album. People who are not already a fan of blackened thrash metal will still probably not care for this. It's a fun ride, it's just not something that hasn't been done before.

At StellaDella’s Girl Scout meeting this evening, we had a lady from Roots-n-Streams who sells handmade items from women and orphans in developing countries to help them become self-sufficient. She gave a presentation which included pictures from Rwanda and Uganda. Afterwards, the girls were able to roll their own paper beads from magazine pages. She had an array of items for sale as well. The craftsmanship of the baskets, bowls, paper jewelry and other items was impressive. I purchased a paper bead necklace & a bookmark made from tree bark for DQ, a paper bead bracelet & small stuffed animal for SD and a paper bead bracelet and this exquisitely made miniature basket ornament for myself.

And in the foreground I was working on some maddening shit. I wrote a very long short story/short novella over the holidays that now, on re-reading, seems deeply exasperating to me. All first drafts do, though. No, that's not true. I was fucking around with it for much of the weekend. At least writing's cheaper than going to therapy.

So I'm off from work all this week, mostly for gardening and yard work, which means I won't be around the interwebs that much.
If I do come back to work, what if I can't keep up with it all? What if I simply can’t do what I used to do before I had a child? Does this mean I’ll be shafted? Let’s face it. This is a business and I can’t expect them to carry me just because I have a child…right? Or can I?

how firmly some of our neighbors - even moderately well-educated ones - now cling to aphorisms, assertions and just-so stories in order to clutch a politically motivated view - or mis-view - of scientific data. Misinformation persists – and propagates – about the dangers of vaccinations, the hazards of nuclear energy, the credibility of creation vs. evolution, and the preponderance of data supporting global warming. In case after politically-redolent case, we find that evidence has a limited power to persuade on hot button issues where deep emotions are involved.

Current Taiji Mayor Kazutaka Sangen claims that the Japanese government and the Taiji fishermen are not willing to change their plans, and stated in an interview with The Associated Press that “we will pass down the history of our ancestors to the next generation, preserve it. We have a strong sense of pride about this”. Sangen also says that the cove is equivalent of a slaughterhouse anywhere else in the world, a naturally gory place that is usually closed off from public view. The major difference here is that most slaughterhouses around the world have laws regarding the treatment of animals. These laws require the animals to be stunned unconscious prior to the slaughtering so that they feel no pain. The dolphin drive hunts in Taiji are conducted with a complete disregard for animal welfare, and there are no restrictions on capture or killing methods, including time to death.

at the bottom of the lake. Melusine thrashed her tail in anger. Why couldn’t she turn human, even for a day? Grandmama had a year, her mother a month. They’d lived on two legs in the land of men, flaunting their wondrous beauty, catching kisses on red, red lips. But the curse became stronger as they got weaker living on tainted waters and broken dreams. By the time Melusine was born, her mother could no longer keep her human form.
She hesitated. “No I just told you that it wasn’t a date.” She took a sip of her water and ran her fingers through her light brown hair. She eyed him. He’d hit a hot button. He gave her a weak smile. “We planned to meet for dinner because we needed to discuss some patient cases we were working on.”
As the legions became faithful to the more powerful men in Rome, there began to become some strife among those men who collected power around themselves. One was obviously Marius, the dude who created the permanent legions. Another was a guy named Cornelius Sulla, who was a rival of Marius. Another was Marius' nephew, a fellow named Gaius Julius Caesar. The faithfulness of Caesar's soldiers allowed him to cross the Rubicon (a question on Final Jeopardy earlier this week) and, essentially, capture Rome. Since Rome was in a state of civil war, and the laws allowed for it, Caesar set himself up as dictator for life. This, in turn, allowed for his nephew (and adopted heir) Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus to seize power in the wake of Julius Caesar's murder on the Senate floor. Augustus, of course, would consolidate power, kill his two rivals, and become the first Roman Emperor.

I read a really inspiring article about people who devoted their lives to preserving nature on Ian Lawton’s lovely soulseeds.com blogsite. Wonderful stories showing that we do so much good when we try, and even more importantly, when we are open and able to admit we are wrong we can change and we can redress the balance and put the past behind us..
Our story begins with Sarah’s death, described in stark, bare terms. Given that she’s one of the matriarchs, and a figure of some significance in Judaic history, it’s kind of interesting that very few of the things attributed to her in the actual text are indicative of any sort of actual virtue. She’s rude to her slave and stepson, contemptuous of the pronouncements of visitors in her home, and apparently passive enough that she is siezed for remarriage under her husband’s nose twice without a peep. None of the female characters in the Torah are really portraits of strong characterization, but what few glimpses we’ve gotten of Sarah’s character, I’m afraid, have not been to her credit.

It looks like a Guardian conspiracy to stir up a controversy. Here's the ever-clever Zoe Williams commissioned to write an article claiming to have given up reading novels because it's irresponsible (or that's the impression given by the sub-editors of the print and online versions respectively) when the political and economic facts of the world need our attention and understanding. And there's Viv Groskop on Twitter disagreeing and claiming that it's in fiction you find the truth. Still, if it focuses attention on the issues, so much the better.

By this time my mama was back and she gave me my helmet and then also reminded me I hadn't braided Daisy's mane. CRAP! So I quickly determined that I should just head on down to the arena and attempt to braid it there if I had time. I grabbed a few rubber bands and headed back down there. And thankfully I did have time to hurriedly get it up. Theres a bit of it in the picture. It wasn't as nice as the day before but I got all of it in there with time to spare!

There was a lack of good stories targeted at teens when I was growing up and also a lack of novels with girls as the main character, overcoming the odds. Recently a mother of a 16 year old girl told me that there are still not enough challenging books with a girl as the hero and she feels that HIDDEN helps to plug that gap. I remember reading the Just William books and loving them as well as the Famous Five, but girls just didn’t do anything interesting. When I was eleven I was very influenced by reading The Lord of the Flies by William Golding. Fantastic adventure story, pushing the boundaries of society as we know it. But not a girl in sight! I really envy the young people today as they have such a wide choice of books to read.
I also wanted to share a couple of other things with you..... like my new fun burner covers. Again.. it's my obsession with "Chalkboard" spray paint. These burner covers were already black.. and getting kind of scratched..so I prayed them with Chalkboard spray paint. Now I can right all kinds of messages. ummm.. like "not cooking tonight". :) No really .. think of all the fun things you could write for different times of the year. ( simple fun)
The place is ginormous and spread out across three exits off I-90 (exits 52, 53, and 54). I'm glad I went with one of my shipmates who had been there before and led us directly to the Nordic center to rent snowshoes, because I never would have found it otherwise. Well, I suppose if I was going by myself, I probably would have done more research on their website before driving up there. The website clearly gives directions telling you which exit to use for which part of the resort you want to visit, and they have interactive maps of the place (click here for the maps).
That's what happened to me last night. About 3:00 a.m. I awoke out of the blue with an idea... and boy, am I glad I did. Of course, I was so excited I couldn't go back to sleep.... so since I'm sleep deprived today, it might not be as good an idea as I thought... Let's see what you think...

About all the antihero shares with the hero is that his character must develop somehow by the story’s end. In either case, typically that character development is toward some illumination or personal growth. But in Touch of Evil, as in many noir films, the trajectory is all downward. Even here Welles avoids cliché. The much-yearned-for release of a bad guy’s repentance or conversion to the good side is never experienced. Instead of building Quinlan’s demise up to a fever pitch with the required climax in the final reel, Welles has him dissolve before us in pathetic degrees. The audience is denied the satisfaction of seeing a bad guy punished for his sins. We almost pity Quinlan rather than shake our fists at him. No wonder the studio executives couldn’t keep their gloves off the final edit.

This past weekend while I was in my training for Body Pump, I made sure to pack myself lunch and adequate snacks. While I was eating one of my snacks, some of the girls that I had made friends with asked what I was eating. I told them what this tasty little morsel was and rattled off the ingredient list without really thinking anything of it. Both of their eyes lit up, and they asked where I got the recipe. “I made it up!” was the answer, and instantly a light bulb clicked in my head that I should make them a batch of this little treat and share the recipe with them.

Regarding the submission info, perhaps there's been some miscommunication? Ask again, insistently but nicely. If she steadfastly refuses to give you any information about submissions, then... I'm sorry. You can't make her give it to you. Perhaps she never sent it out at all. But perhaps if she understood that you want that info because you are leaving her, she would understand why you need it, now.

Kanthari chilli, is commonly known as Thai pepper or Bird’s Eye Chilli. It is smaller than other kinds of peppers but much spicier. And it’s usually used in Thai dishes, so most Thai food tastes spicy.
The last couple of weeks at the shop have been manic, and I mean MANIC! I suppose when you sell four times as much beer in a week as you normally do that's to be expected though. That's my excuse for the lack of posts out of the way, but while I've had time away from the writing, it's still been very fun to read about what others have been getting up to during the holiday period. It was also very nice to see all the local Bloggers and beer lovers in the shop over the past couple of weeks, it made me feel a little inadequate when I saw shopping baskets full to the brim of glorious beer. I clearly didn't drink enough this Christmas. I even spied Tandleman at one point paroosing our specialist beers and we had a decent chat. (He even nearly went away with a Brewdog Badge!)
But when she woke up in Zumi's, our local fair trade coffee shop, she babbled "happy" again and again. I think we both feel better. Walks and January thaws (and a decaf caramel cloud latte for me:) definitely make us both "happy". Perhaps when she wakes up from her nap we'll go to the beach!

So I guess the question is in the end, where is the line? How far do you go to try to make your non-human creatures sympathetic? Is it okay to defy logic if it really will help the general audiences of your story (who I doubt would have even considered the blood, since no one else in the room when I watched it did, and I had a biology/science communication major and a physicist amongst others in there with me) sympathise with your characters?
For my project, I combined a bit of embroidery with some basic stitching to create a drawstring pocket pouch made from burlap and muslin.

Are you aware of World Book Day? April 23 was established by UNESCO as World Book Day in 1995 to promote reading, publishing and copyright. Why April 23rd*? Because in 1616, Cervantes, Shakespeare and Inca Garcilaso de la Vega all died. April 23rd is also the date of birth or death of other authors such as Maurice Druon, Halldor Laxness, Vladimir Nabokov, Josep Pla and Manuel Mejía Vallejo. And, while she may not be in the same class as these luminaries, the Australian creator of Mary Poppins, P.L. Travers died on April 23 (in 1996).

Natalie pulled into the small parking lot next to the other cars, grabbed her duffel bag from the backseat, and pushed open the door to the office. "Hello?" she inquired. "Is anyone here?" The front desk was littered with yellowing papers and chewed-up pencils. A rusty bell sat on a ledge over the desk. Responding to her shake, the sound reverberated jarringly through the quiet of the room, like she had disturbed something meant to stay untouched.

There is a polar shift taking place, but not the kind you're thinking of. The west has withdrawn from South Africa and the East has been moving in. Rather than fight it, the west chose to run and leave the New SA to the Chinese. While South Africa used to be part of the west, it is now fast becoming part of the east, the polar shift. While the west may be run by various groupings of sinister old men controlling the banks, the east, China in particular, has its own agenda, far removed from the ideals of the control-freaks of the west. The west may think they are in control, but they're only in control of themselves, to an extent, because the agenda of the east is far superior to that of the west. The economies of the west had fallen to the cheap production costs of the east.

And here I shall begin the endless babble of boys. I have had a couple of run-ins with some guys recently. For instance, there’s this one guy who I see as I’m walking back to my dorm after class sometimes who has a smile that makes me want to melt into the ground every time I see it. Then there was this guy in the DC the other day with the most gorgeous eyes ever! The weird part was that he kept looking at me as I sat there eating my cereal. I was sitting alone, people watching, and texting a few friends. Anyways this guy, gets his phone out like he’s sending a text, but what it looked like to me was that he was trying to discretely take a picture. For the sake of everything, I hope he was just sending a text. Awkward.

It's narrated by Mac McCorkle, an American who owns a bar, Mac's Place, in Bonn, West Germany (this is during the Cold War, remember, when Germany was two nations). His business partner is one Mike Padillo, who is also an occasional and increasingly reluctant secret agent – and perhaps even an assassin – for the US government. McCorkle drinks too much, carouses too much, but he isn't a young man anymore, while Padillo, for his part, has had enough of the double life he leads. For his latest mission Padillo is tasked with carrying out an exchange of spies in Berlin, but there's a twist, and inevitably things go somewhat sour.

The 36th were in operation in World War II for 366 days, including 132 days of consecutive combat, which is a record in modern military history. The 36th was also the first American Division to land on continentally-occupied European soil, in Salerno, almost a year before the Normandy landings. The strange thing about the Salerno landing is that the 36th managed on its first day to push up to the ancient city of Paestum, only to be pushed back to the sea by the German counter-attack. After a few days of savage fighting, the Allies secured the beach head and the Germans, instead of staying on an annihilating the Allies, pulled back and left to fight another day. But Salerno proved very instructive–it taught the Allies how the Germans handled coastal invasions, and helped the Allies plan their D-Day strategy.

The movie and the doctors in it are advocating for complete plant and whole food diets. Throughout the movie, they follow a few different "clients" (people who moved to the plant based diet) as well as some mouse testing :-/ The tests done comparing diets with high animal-protein diets vs low animal-protein (not no animal-protein). I guess you could say that the movie was an introduction to a vegan diet...Maybe I can convince my carnivore of a husband...we will see... :-) The results were amazing...watch the movie!

I'll tell you know that I knew enough to know that there was NO POINT in trying to to detailed beer reviews. With maybe a couple dozen stands of different beers, I'll just hit the highlights.

Call centre conversations are immensely frustrating, but is this because one of those involved isn’t really listening? How are you helping, others you are beholden to help, and yourself?
What can be extracted from his story to draw Guillotin as he would be now, if he'd continued to live? Well, he took credit for inventing something he only appropriated and improved, so that suggests a certain degree of self-importance, selfishness, opportunism, even arrogance. He has turned his not-inconsiderable intellect to the task of working out how to kill people with minimum pain. Though the aim is compassionate, the task is gruesome. Perhaps it takes a certain amount of detachment to tackle this problem? Perhaps it takes so much detachment that this character is rather lacking in empathy. And from this, I developed Ignace as he is now, two hundred years later.
The photo shoot began at Liz’s house, moved to the craft store, took a turn toward the bakery, drove through Vancouver, settled at home for a moment, bundled up for a cold walk to the coffee shop, and ended with a warm beverage and my favorite shot of the day. A perfect “extra” day! See you again in 4!
So in case you missed it, Monday was FourSquare Day. A day of celebration for social media geeks who document their whereabouts on a regular basis and share their experiences, thoughts and tips with the rest of the internet world.
Politicians whom I don't agree with are one thing; politicians who are incredibly stupid, as this lot are, are an insult to our intelligence. There are many more reasons to despise this budget, but I've kept within the remit of my blog here. Please sign the beer tax escalator petition to the right if you haven't done so already.
We do not choose to be born. We do not choose our parents. We do not choose our historical epoch, or the country of our birth, or the immediate circumstances of our upbringing. We do not, most of us, choose to die; nor do we choose the time or conditions of our death. But within all this realm of choicelessness, we do choose how we shall live: with purpose or adrift, with joy or with joylessness, with hope or with despair, with humor or with sadness, with a positive outlook or a negative outlook, with pride or with shame, with inspiration or with defeat and with honor or with dishonor. We decide that what makes us significant or insignificant. We decide to be creative or to be indifferent. No matter how indifferent the universe may be to our choices and decisions, these choices and decisions are ours to make. We decide. We choose. In the end, the meaning of our own life is decided by what we choose to do or what we refuse to do. And as we decide and choose, so are our destinies formed.
Gone, gone, the damage done.
The findings of the commission, which are to be released two years from now, will allow their families not only to know the fate of their loved ones but also to bring closure to their lives.

than it ever was in my corporate world, and Saturday night application
Seventy-five years ago, UI was probably the most important, the most important, and legally and politically the most difficult piece of FDR’s agenda that the Committee on Economic Security (CES) wrestled with. The sheer burden of the task was daunting – twenty million Americans were living on Federal relief, so demand for UI would be high, but unemployment was still at 14% and wages had been badly hammered so where would the funds come from to establish a reserve? Politically, the right thundered against creeping socialism and an un-American dole and the left visions of plenty if we “shared the wealth. Legally, the Supreme Court had set its face like thunder against the New Deal and all its works. And the progressive movement was split.

Such things were written in the Scriptures long ago to teach us. And the Scriptures give us hope and encouragement as we wait patiently for God’s promises to be fulfilled. Romans 15:4, NLT
I opened my eyes groggily and pullingthe sheet off my head sat up. A maid bustled past the doorway and there were voices in the street outside, of merchants, slave dealers and children. I fell back against the pillows again, and studied the ceiling. Had it all been a dream? It was so real though, the shudder of the earth, the sparks, the cold of the stone floor. My little brother Acanthus rushed in pulling a wooden horse on heels behind him. He held it up to my face and attempted to make horse noises. I smiled and picked him up " Good morning Acan'" I said tickling his chubby tummy "Cassia!" he gurgled through ticklish laughs. He seemed to only be able to pronounce people's names so far.

Meet our main protagonist, Lee Everett.
- ava took her first steps a week or two ago. I actually can't remember exactly thanks to our mini-trip to san diego. I'm not really ready for two toddlers and I've loved how ava has been so relaxed and has taken everything slow. emerie was the exact opposite, with her first steps at 9 months. it was insane and I'm really happy not to be repeating that. I still think ava could hold off a little longer and I'd be happy. her doctor pointed out to me that it was hilarious to see how small ava was - and she was just standing and walking around.
The three witches that reminded me of blue cheese salad dressing looked fantastic, but the scene didn't carry the same weight for me this time around.
