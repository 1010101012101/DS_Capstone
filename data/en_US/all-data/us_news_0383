The Browns will need to wrestle with this draft reality: Beyond Claiborne, cornerbacks with exceptional cover skills are few. Many have the physical tools but remain raw in the technical aspects of the position. Opting for Johnson early in the second round constitutes a reach, but he's intriguing enough to be worthy of consideration early in the third. A mid-round potential value pick is Virginia's Chase Minnifield, son of former Browns standout Frank.

Earthquakes tend to be seen as apocalyptic one-off events. The earth shakes, the sky burns and life grinds to a halt. Call special effects! But in history's larger context -- geological forces rumbling through time -- the tumult isn't nearly so profound. A tectonic plate shoves against its neighbor as tension builds. Something snaps. Pressure is released, and the process begins anew.

So is Girl and the Goat worthy of the buzz and long waits? Absolutely. Our meal was one to remember, starting with freshly baked beet bread and goat cheese butter. I devoured the kohlrabi salad; my husband loved the escargot ravioli.

If not, your ignorance is understandable. As Brian Holden, one of the founding members, told Variety, "Our marketing team is Twitter and teenage girls telling their friends." On the other hand, StarKid's unwillingness to settle on a traditional media model has been confusing — when I asked the StarKids what they were, I got everything from "comedy troupe" to "online repertory theater company." Even Criss, speaking by phone from Los Angeles, said, "I am always explaining StarKid. 'We're under the radar but not really,' or, 'If you're online, then you get us.' Having to explain it is a nightmare in Los Angeles. People are like, 'Wait, you did this in school?' I'm like, 'Yeah, but it's online.' It's so convoluted it always comes down to a pat on my head and this feeling that there is no way at the moment for us to prove our success if you're outside the circle."

John Cooper, a Tennessee native, had been the coach at Tulsa and Arizona State and was hired largely because he had beaten Ohio States archrival, Michigan, in a Rose Bowl. But people never considered his Southern drawl all that charming and they truly despised that he was 2-10-1 against Michigan and just 3-8 in bowl games. He is considered Exhibit A why its bad karma for Ohio State to think outside the box ... or even think outside the states borders.

Residents such as Bahr are organizing cleanup campaigns in neighborhoods where trash can be swept into the harbor. Activists have pushed state and federal governments to the verge of ordering the city to halt the torrent of trash that washes into the harbor — two to three tons in a single day after a heavy rain. They've documented how bad the water is — with "shockingly high" bacteria counts in places such as are more typically found in an unflushed toilet.
If the Dirty Tricks Scandal were merely a matter of one politician's tossing mud pies at another, it would indeed have been small beer.

SECOND TEAM OFFENSE
What makes the memory amusing, of course, is that the '60s and '70s are now themselves long ago and covered with dust. Time, you see, does not stop its relentless march to watch your generation preen in self-satisfaction. This is a truth each generation learns in turn. The child who comes of age now will find it hard to imagine a someday world in which iPads, cloud computing and Lady Gaga are just some memory with which she bores her kids.
Meeting with TV critics in Los Angeles, HBO shared a long list of classy and ambitious projects, including series, specials and movies. The network didn't even take time for executive boasts. Instead, it put its talent on display, beginning with a late-evening screening of 15 minutes of its much-anticipated fantasy series "Game of Thrones," clips that even author George R.R. Martin hadn't seen.

Remaining independent has allowed Van Noten to evolve at his own pace. Take, for instance, the fabrics he chooses for his collections, most of which are made exclusively for him up to a year in advance. This fall, he used a high-tech fabric from Japan that looks like tapestry. Two years ago, he had village women in remote Uzbekistan weave fabric that was carried by mule for a day and a half to the local DHL office to be shipped to his studio in Antwerp.
Best player matchup: Baylor’s Pierre Jackson vs. Xavier’s Tu Holloway, South Region. Back when he was a sophomore, Holloway scored 26 points in an epic Sweet 16 matchup between Xavier and Kansas State. Jordan Crawford was the star for that Musketeers team, but that game announced Holloway as the next big thing. In Xavier’s tournament-opening win against No. 7 seed Notre Dame on Friday, Holloway scored 25 points and knocked home the go-ahead running bank shot with 12 seconds left. On a team with multiple NBA big men—Perry Jones III, Quincy Miller and Quincy Acy—it’s the 5-foot-10 point guard, Jackson, who has emerged as the team’s leader on the court. He had 18 points on 6-for-11 shooting in the opener against South Dakota State, then had 15 points, 10 assists and five steals as Baylor beat Colorado to advance to the Sweet 16.

Now, as second-generation reality royalty, the former assistant has invited cameras along as he tries to build his own roster of A-list clientele. The result is pretty much the sum of its interchangeable reality TV parts: photo shoots, foreign travel, domestic banter (the other key player in the series is Goreski's longtime boyfriend,"Family Guy"writer Gary Janetti), workplace stress and tears — lots and lots of tears. Goreski is an inveterate weeper, and the waterworks flow with such regularity on the show one ends up wondering if all those bow ties and velvet blazers have been given a proper coating of Scotchgard.

Expect that message to continue as he faces new rounds of questions about his business career and continued reluctance to provide more than two years of tax returns.
The Answer: I certainly hoped I would. I started with the company almost right out of college and just loved it right away. I started in that customer service dispatch area. So very quickly I realized this is really a unique service. It is absolutely a high-end service, something that I would want to be associated with, the people here are excellent, and I always thought, "Gosh, I would like to run it at some point in time." I worked my way up the ladder, and when we were acquired by FedEx in 1998, I knew for sure I wanted to stay with the company.

Nobody stands to win if nothing meaningful comes out of these deliberations (as much as both sides would inevitably claim some kind of Pyrrhic victory by standing pat). But the voters will know the score — a gridlocked, do-nothing Congress retreats to form, and the national interest is left high and dry again. That's a year-old stage of grief the public knows all too well.

"At the end of the day, reality has to set in," Williams said. "We've got a talented team, but it doesn't matter how talented you are, if you haven't jelled as a team, it'll show. I'm like the worst at it. I've got all four players on the court, and get them in their spots, and think how I want it, and I forget I have a lane or a shot. That'll go away, and we'll start reading and reacting, and we'll all start playing better."

Director Gabriel Barre stages this Pippin more elaborately than I remember it - and more imaginatively. There's a lot going on, and it all makes sense, from the cast's amusing portrayal of animals on the farm where Pippin's life is saved (or possibly squelched into normalcy), to the way supporting players come and go in different personas. But for all Barre's inventiveness, the tour has irritants.

This expansive corner of Scotland is known simply as Cawdor. It is an 80-square-mile estate that has belonged to the Thanes of Cawdor and their family since the 13th century. Today, the property is in the nurturing hands of the seventh Earl of Cawdor and 25th Thane, Colin, and his wife, Isabella, who moved into the valley shortly after they married in 1994. Since then, they have transformed what was once a lonely and slightly neglected place into a magical and lively spot—and also one of the best partridge shoots in the country.

The Supreme Court usually takes around 90 days to decide whether it will hear a case. If it agrees to hear this case -- as seems likely since there are conflicting rulings from different federal appellate districts -- a decision would come by the end of June 2012 when presidential candidates are gearing up in earnest for the general election. The Affordable Care Act was a key election issue in 2010, with many victorious Republicans promising to strive for its repeal.

In his nine years as president, Farahi has constantly battled with union members who claim he does not put education first and has buried the school in debt. But the 63-year-old president said he is steadfast in his belief that he has made the right decisions in leading the 16,000-student public university, pointing to the school’s rise in enrollment and its pristine campus. Farahi acknowledged, however, his reform efforts have not endeared himself to professors, whom he asked to work harder, hold more office hours and submit time sheets.

Even last fall, however, there were doubts that the occupy movement would have a lasting influence on American politics and economics. It wasn’t just obtuse commentators from Fox News and CNN with their jokes about pot-smoking hippies who were skeptical; it was also serious political thinkers. Liberal icon Barney Frank, the gay, lefty congressman from Massachusetts, said at the time that unless the occupiers organized to have a direct effect on electoral politics, all their earnest idealism would do little to change the corrupt symbiosis between Wall Street and Congress.
I just finished a pretty good book by Colin Woodard called "American Nations." He found 11, four of them meeting in Colorado: Far West, El Norte, Midlands and Appalachia. Of relevance here is the Deep South. There, little has changed in four centuries, even if its oligarchs are now Republicans instead of Democrats. They want "a compliant, poorly educated, low-wage workforce with as few labor, workplace safety, health care, and environmental regulations as possible."
But its heavy focus on up-and-coming consumer products is a promising sign for early-stage manufacturers, which are often viewed as too risky for traditional lenders.

Scheduling at least one FCS school has become the way of life in big-time college football. Occasionally, the little school can play David to the big school's Goliath, and give us an upset very early in the college football season.

Speaking of undrafted free agents, two potential signings definitely worth keeping an eye on are defensive tackles Nicolas Jean-Baptiste out of Baylor, and Ishmaa’ily Kitchen of Kent State. Both are 335-pound guys who can clog the middle and be factors in the run game.

The sordid and delectable crowd together just as they do in the border city itself. In one piece, a woman stands with her arms raised overhead. A skeleton is traced atop her form like white icing.

Racy? Sure. Entertaining? You bet. But all the sex and the flash, and even the backing of über-producer Brian Grazer, can't make up for what this look at 1972's porn phenom, "Deep Throat," lacks: questions.For the uninitiated, "Deep Throat" stars Harry Reems as a wacky doctor and Linda Lovelace as his wide-eyed and -jawed patient whose clitoris is lodged in her throat.The film, Bailey and Barbato assert, cost $25,000 to make and grossed $600 million, but the math is fuzzy since the production's financial backerthe mobwasn't exactly a slave to the books. The Mafia's attachment to what became mainstream entertainment is only touched on briefly in the doc, probably because everyone knows that the mix of Hollywood and the mob is a total snoozefest.
