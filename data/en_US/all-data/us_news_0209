Republicans devoted their weekly address to spotlighting steps being taken by the new GOP House majority, including trimming House members' operating budgets and, more importantly, moving to repeal Obama's signature health care law.

Maicon Santos. Imagine the bewildered looks in North Texas as FC Dallas partisans contemplate Maicon Santos' six goals, the fourth-highest total in MLS. FCD let the journeyman Brazilian leave for nothing after he managed just two goals in 11 games for the club last year. Signed as a free agent by D.C.

Santos beat the normally resolute Dynamo back four twice on Saturday and has four goals in his past four games.

Kristie: One of our earliest posts came out of a need to explain our choice in name to the scientific community. The term "bug" refers to a very specific type of insect, but we use it as a catch-all for arthropods; animals that have exoskeletons, jointed limbs, bilateral symmetry and segmented bodies. Some hardcore science types probably think this is a bad idea. However, most people on the street who have never taken an entomology course use the term "bug" to describe anything wriggly, or creepy-crawly. Our goal is to connect with the people who DON'T know about insects and spiders, so we use their language, and turn our name into a teachable moment. We did not come to our name lightly, so we decided to be upfront about it in a blog post. It's not necessarily the deepest or the funniest but it was a special moment as bloggers when we stepped out with an opinion, instead of just reporting facts or telling people what we're up to. In the end, this post helped us to solidify our mission, and to realize that we are translators of science.

In October 2006, Yankee pitcher Cory Lidle was killed with his flying instructor after taking off from Teterboro for a Manhattan sightseeing trip. After flying south down the Hudson, and around the Statue of Liberty, Lidle's single-engine plane failed to negotiate a turn over the East River and crashed into an apartment building at 72nd St. Under exiting regulations they flew the whole route without advance permission, required only to stay over the river and below 1,100 feet. Days later, however, the FAA changed the rules for fixed-wing aircraft, requiring they ask permission before flying along the East River.
I casted to a spot where I knew the water was 7-8 feet deep. When the bobber didn't move in a couple of minutes, I reeled in and slid the float another 2 feet up the line. This time the bait was about 6 feet deep, and it was less than 30 seconds before something took the bobber down hard, a good indication that the fish (or at least those in a feeding mood) were hanging out near the bottom rather than suspending in midwater.

Felton played his best game in over a month: 14 points, eight assists, two turnovers on 6-of-11 shooting. Smith looked both capable and culpable during his stint, both justifying McMillan's decision to use him but also showing why he wasn't rushed into duty. And Batum continued to flourish in his starting role with 22 points. Also, a motivational ploy by McMillan to light a fire under Matthews is working, as Matthews had 13 points and two steals.

The funding crisis operates at all levels. Because of the level of local poverty, the Garfield Heights district gets about half its revenue from the state, not from local property owners. But those dollars are dropping precipitously. In the 2008-2009 school year, Garfield schools got $5,339 in state money per pupil; that plummeted last school year to $4,662, a 13 percent drop in just one year, as enrollment stayed about the same. Local dollars also fell by 14 percent year-over-year, as tax delinquencies climbed. The difference was made up by a 79 percent increase in federal revenue, but most of that was one-time money. And still, per-pupil spending had to be reduced 7 percent.

I'm not saying to never say "no" to your dog, but try to reward him for what he does right, or steer him to a desired activity, far more often than you tell him "no." Dogs are creatures of habit, and the habits you teach him during the first few days of this program will last a lifetime. "No" usually just lasts until your back is turned.

In this era of David Lynch nightmares, Charles Gounod's "Faust" is a problematic opera. For modern sensibilities, its treatment of a desperate man's deal with the devil can seem frivolous and dated. Yes, Gounod could shape a melody, which is probably why this opera remains a staple of the repertory after 150-plus years. But "Faust" is a risk, because its supposed devilishness can so easily turn musty and dull.

Novitzky quibbled over slippery terms like "personal knowledge" and "distribution" until Hardin had to ask the question properly.

But this British fireplug can carry a film, as evidenced by "HandMade Films Collection: Bob Hoskins."

Regardless of the source, the human body treats lead as a poison linked especially in children to lost intelligence, ADHD and other health problems.
The poor economy has some looking for alternatives. The U.S. military saw its highest proportion of Asian recruits in 2009.

We also reached out to Strike Force employees and people who interacted with the Strike Force to determine whether individuals at the Strike Force engaged in misconduct. Our review of the documents, the evidence at the Strike Force offices, and the evidence that is missing from the offices, and the statements of witnesses, led us to the conclusion that egregious misconduct took place at the Strike Force. I want to make clear that, in reaching this conclusion, we did not rely on rumor, hearsay, or biased accounts provided by individuals with their own agenda. Unless we were able to confirm an allegation by two or more sources, we did not include the allegation in our Report.

For example, students were asked this question: "A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?" The intuitive answer — 10 cents — would be wrong. A little math on the fly reveals that the correct answer would be 5 cents.

Some breeds, such as poodles, require a full-blown grooming extravaganza. But for many, a $16 pet pit stop at a place like U-Shampooch Self Serve Dog Wash (7474 E. 29th Ave.; 303-321-5353) works just fine. If washing at home, U-Shampooch's Catlin Galligan recommends commercial dog shampoo over homemade versions or sharing human shampoo with your pet.

The congresswoman in question is Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., a grandmother first elected to the House in 2004 when she was 61. The chairwoman of the House subcommittee on higher education and a former president of a community college, she is proud that she worked her way through college without borrowing a dime. It took her seven years. And here is what Foxx actually said on Gordon Liddy's talk show earlier this month:
Understandably, the wait time was too long for the games with guns, so we took Stacy's advice and tried Typhoon. You sit in a reclining chair that resembles the cockpit of a jet fighter and enjoy a simulated ride without having to do anything.

Obama's budget proposals have urged Congress to reconsider many of the preferences in the tax code. The proposed Buffett rule, however, is a shortcut that skips the debate over the policy intricacies.

Dolphin Adventure at the Indianapolis Zoo is the only place in the Midwest with a dolphin interaction program open to the public. About 35 minutes of the 90-minute program takes place in the water.

It wasn't all testy. Perry drew laughter as well as applause when he said that federal bureaucrats would experience pain as a result of his plans to cut spending, especially those in the departments of education, commerce and energy.

Robinson is an anti-modernist or pre-modernist writer, though not a reactionary one: She engages with the contemporary world rather turning her back on it. She is old-fashioned in her emphasis on continuity with the past rather than disruption, and she celebrates collective achievement as opposed to the alienated and transgressive individual genius. She sees religion as a stimulus to creative thought rather than a suppressant.

Projections on a back screen call our attention to key words and images. Snatches of music establish the mood of a scene, just as music does in movies. The furniture in the St. Louis apartment that's home to the Wingfield family isn't much, even by their standards of genteel poverty.

The two started the night off with a Tony & Melanie Paso Doble. And I must warn you, this was not Season 6's Paso from Brandon & Jeanine. It was, in a word, whatever. It started out fast and fierce but quickly tapered off as they broke apart. Sasha is still, physically, the strongest female dancer in the competition and it shows. The real surprise was Alex. I've been critical of his lack of emotion this year and that actually helped in a style where the men are to remain stoic and fierce. Mary summed it up quite nicely telling him, "I still think Sash was a little bit stronger, but you hung in there brother."

Because without a director in place, the consumer watchdog agency that we've set up doesn't have all the tools it needs to protect consumers against dishonest mortgage brokers or payday lenders and debt collectors who are taking advantage of consumers.
