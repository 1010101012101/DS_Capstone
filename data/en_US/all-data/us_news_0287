There's a nuanced flavor running through Autumn Martin's s'mores cookies. Is that bacon? Not quite. In order to replicate the char of marshmallows roasted over a campfire, the Seattle-based pastry pro smokes chocolate chips with alder wood and adds them to her batter. The former overseer of Theo Chocolate's kitchen has been mastering this maneuver for the past five years. Now, with her new company, Hot Cakes—purveyor of decadent jarred desserts, over-the-top salted caramels and cookies—she has found other ways to apply the technique. Ms. Martin sells the chips separately so that adventurous sweet-crafters can experiment at will. Suggested applications include incorporating the smoky nibs into a ganache, which can then be blended into a Scotch milkshake, grinding them into savory meat rubs, using them for a mousse or simply melting them into a drizzle-on for buttered toast. $9 for three cookies, $14 per 8-ounce bag of chips, getyourhotcakes.com

Honestly, were there any groundbreaking revelations? Of course it was disappointing that the Rangers marched into Comerica Park and took three out of four from the Tigers. But anybody who thinks four games in April will have any impact at all on what happens in October has clearly never watched any baseball before.

That hardcore country twang of hers felt right at home on a song by another "American Idol" country gal, Kellie Pickler, as Skylar accompanied herself on acoustic guitar while singing the words to this heartbreaking ballad as though she was living them. It was a perfect fit, of course. As Randy Jackson told her, "You could have a hit with a song like that."

Last season's race came down to two kids singing country and Skylar's voice is way more country than Lauren Alaina's or Scotty McCreery's. In fact, she was so good, I briefly stopped thinking about how dumb it was to surround her with those stupid flaming trash cans and just listened.

The current discussion about Guthrie diversity and the April 20 Letter of the Day about the sliding quality of its productions are simply off the mark.

But single pane windows can create convection currents within the house even if they are not leaking warm air outside, Gunn says. In cold weather, single pane glass will get more chilled than the interior side of a double-pane window. Even though that has little effect on the temperature of the room, the single pane glass chills the air right next to it, causing the air to drop down and other air to move in. A person standing or sitting near the chilled glass will also lose body heat that radiates toward the glass.

His nascent campaign - using the slogan "A Conservative for Missouri" - has focused so far on one key theme: job growth. Spence believes his unconventional candidacy - he derides "lifetime politicians" - will be a selling point, even if his wealth might make him hard-pressed to meet most people's idea of an average Joe.

Such global exposure has made the work a target. London bookies have offered 20/1 odds on this work getting stolen before the auction. Two other versions of "The Scream" were stolen from Oslo museums. In 1994, thieves brought a ladder to a window at the National Gallery on the first day of the Olympics in Lillehammer and took the work, leaving a note in its place thanking the museum for its lousy security. A decade later, masked gunmen entered the Munch Museum and nabbed "The Scream" and another Munch work. (Mars Inc., which used "The Scream" in advertising for dark-chocolate M&Ms, offered two million M&Ms for the work's return, though that candy reward has not yet been delivered per instructions by Norwegian authorities, according to the company.) Both works were eventually recovered.

There's no doubting Jenkins' football skill. A Parade All-American in high school, Jenkins was an immediate starter as a true freshman at Florida, and started 34 games over three seasons with the Gators. He more than held his own during that time with some of the best wideouts in the Southeastern Conference, including 2011 first-round draft picks A.J. Green and Julio Jones.

Doctors are concerned about side effects associated with testosterone. Potential problems include the worsening of sleep apnea, enlargement of the prostate and overproduction of red blood cells, which can cause a stroke if the levels climb too high. And because the treatment can raise blood levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the marker screened for in prostate cancer tests, it may lead to detection of very slow-growing cancers that would never have presented problems to the patient. This can lead to unnecessary treatments with potential for side effects such as incontinence or impotence.

It’s rarely smooth sledding. She’s not here to make it easy, and she tells you so. The triple (!) album begins with a restless Newsom in bed with a boyfriend and ends in domestic apocalypse. In between come the harrowing dreams and hallucinatory visions, the stories of spiders, stolen horses and stillborn babies, and endless cascades of harp notes. Putting this one back in the rack is an entirely sane decision. Or you could take a deep breath and plunge in.
"Today it was poinsettias going to Providence, R.I.," the Lucas Greenhouses delivery driver said Thursday while stopped at Vince Lombardi Service Area in Ridgefield during his return trip. "It’s been those all week, and in the spring it’ll be loads of pansies."

Supervisor training has started. It's to bring all the supervisors together so that they understand how to recognize issues that employees are having and then how to get the services to them. The officers said they very much would like a system in which they can access services, and do it quickly, but not be more afraid of the discipline than they are of the help and assistance. If I said I think I have a drinking problem, I'd like to be able to come in and get assistance but not believe that just because I asked for that help it means my career is over, that I can't get promoted, I can't get to a specialized unit. So we've developed a way to be able to do it.

RHP Aaron Cook remains in limbo. If the Red Sox don't recall Cook from Class AAA Pawtucket by Wednesday, the veteran sinkerballer can activate an opt-out clause in his minor league contract. Even then, though, the Red Sox would have 48 hours to either release Cook or call him up. Given the success Cook has had at Pawtucket, his track record over the past 10 seasons with the Colorado Rockies and the lack of pitching depth across the majors, it's unlikely the Red Sox would allow him to become a free agent. However, they also don't have a spot for Cook in the rotation. Although he has expressed a willingness to pitch out of the bullpen, he undoubtedly would prefer to start, a role for which he would be better suited. Cook likely would have several suitors if he reached the open market.

When the dinner plates are cleared, Ventura sits with Fuentes and explains how much sugar her kids may be getting. She places seven teaspoons of sugar into a cup -- the equivalent of what's in a glassful of fruit punch -- and Fuentes is shocked. She thought the punch was a smart choice. "Wow," she says. "That's already a lot of sugar. I just figured, they're kids, and it's juice." She's also surprised at the amount of sugar -- 60 grams, or about 14 teaspoons -- in 16 ounces of Jaylen's favorite pre-made chocolate milk.
She's created a menu where the most expensive item one night was $23 for slow-roasted beef, a manicured chunk of fork-tender meat on winter greens, their bitterness quelled by cream, all on a bed of rough-edged grits smoothed with ricotta.

Tom Coughlin didn’t mince words when he assessed his team’s performance immediately after the Giants’ Sunday night loss against the Philadelphia Eagles. The fiery coach was particularly incensed with his offensive line’s play, and it was hard not to be, given how ineffective the run game was (29 yards on 17 carries, or 1.7 yards per carry) and the constant duress Eli Manning was under all night (16 pressures, 3 sacks).

Q: I have a question regarding the identity theft that's been in the news lately with people fraudulently e-filing a federal tax return using someone else's identity in order to obtain a refund. Even with another person's Social Security number, how can this scheme work without a W-2 form? The W-2 form indicates a person's taxable income and verifies the income tax they paid during the year. I would think that the IRS would definitely not process one's taxes without the W-2 information.

At the other table North passed originally and East became declarer at three no trump after West opened with a strong one club and made no effort to locate a major-suit fit after East's positive one no trump response. South led a diamond, won in the closed hand. Declarer led a spade to the knave, cashed the ace and conceded a spade to the king. South decided to set up some diamond tricks so continued with the ace of diamonds and another. That meant 10 tricks for East-West for a score of 630 and a gain of 14 IMPs on the deal. (04/26/12)

He served in the Air Force for six years, piloting small planes as a forward air controller in Vietnam ("the worst job in the country — we flew at 1,500 feet, and the enemy could practically hit you with a rock.") After his discharge he piloted jets for American Airlines for 32 years.
Hotel Sol y Luna, $48-$65. This pretty, vaguely Colonial, vaguely Victorian, and thoroughly contemporary boutique hotel stands at the corner of Parque Las Palapas, Cancún's de facto central square. Rooms are simple but individually decorated with bold colors and themed artwork, and each has a small balcony. Perfectly located for exploring downtown, it includes certain luxurious touches (magnifying mirrors, hair dryers, mini fridges). A tapas and wine bar occupies the first floor.

Most schools don't just buy beef as a bulk commodity. They make purchases from distributors who put together meals, or components of meals.

Little of that psychological complexity survives in Andy Graham and Roger Parsley's 1998 English stage adaptation - now receiving its American premiere at New Conservatory Theatre Center - as it doesn't in the 1987 Merchant Ivory film version either.

Side orders of amarillos (fried yellow plantains, $2.50) or tostones (fried green plantains $2), arroz con gandules (rice with pigeon peas, $3.50) are worth a try, but I’d go for the carne frita ($3.50, small; $5.50, large), tender and juicy pieces of fried pork. The pork and chicken ($1.25 per piece) are beautifully seasoned. I’d be proud to serve the chicken, roasted or skillet-fried to guests. Don’t miss the pernil (roasted pork) or the fried pork chops, sautéed pork chops with onions, and beef or chicken stew. They all come as daily specials, as does bistec ($7, small platter; $9, large). Platters come in take-out containers with rice and beans, tostones and amarillos. It’s a big meal for a little price.

* The Republican Party is at an important juncture in its history. Not only did the Republicans lose the presidency, but for the second election in a row they lost seats in the House and the Senate, many in red states. The party can move in one of two directions. First, it can retreat into a rigid ideological bubble and blame the defeat on the liberal media (even though they won in 2000 and 2004 despite the liberal media) or on McCain. This is the path of the California Republican Party, pre- Arnold Schwarzenegger. Or Republicans can loosen the coalition, tame the Palinistas and libertarians and try to win back more of the middle class and emerging minority voters. The failure to take the second path could have long-lasting consequences: The Republicans cannot concede a whole new generation of voters and the nonwhite population to the Democratic Party, or they will be shivering in the political cold for a very long time.

So, the bad news is you can't install iTunes or your favorite Windows or Mac accounting suite on a Chromebook.

The Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association opposes state Issue 1 because there is no compelling reason to abandon the current age threshold.

Kasich stressed that local governments should begin receiving casino money near the tail end of his two-year budget and that the communities will get tools to help them combat rising costs, such as the ability to share services across governmental lines.
All the rest of the movie involves a search for the missing dog. All of it. Three days of it. The three couples trek mountain trails and woodland glens, Bryan having hooked up with the gypsy psychic. She provides them with visions: She sees a red-haired woman and imagines the color blue, indeed, although when they meet the woman she knows nothing about the dog. They also appeal to the sheriff's department, tracking down Sheriff Morris (Sam Shepard) while he's fly-fishing on his day off. He has a kidney stone attack, which generates mighty big excitement. There's also an ominous confrontation with a threatening mountain man wearing a Harvard sweatshirt.
Robinson isn't the only former Oriole in attendance. Former O's outfielder Larry Sheets coaches the Gilman team, which features Ryan Ripken and Gavin Sheets.

The draw: Kailua's 2 1/2 -mile-long, powdery beach on the windward (eastern) side of Oahu offers excellent swimming and kayaking, but you can just take a stroll and watch windsurfers zip around . Or head southeast to Lanikai Beach, which locals say is one of the best swimming beaches in Hawaii. Located in an upscale residential area, it's hard to find. But its waters are shielded by an offshore reef. And twin bird sanctuary islands, about a mile off shore, add relief to the horizon.
But then, again, what was going on with Marty (Fred Koehler, perfectly cast), Natalie's smitten neighbor, who kept turning out to have connections with the string of victims? Not only was he timid as a mouse, he was a mouse creature, aka Mauhertz, known for scampering away from trouble and burrowing into a safe hiding place. What was his connection to the murders? The plot kept us guessing.
In 2008, a couple accused an intoxicated Bales of grabbing a woman's hand and thrusting it toward his crotch before kicking and punching the woman's boyfriend, according to a police report. Prosecutors declined to pursue that case.

But Romney's role in forging a Massachusetts health care plan could be. The law requires virtually everyone in the state to have medical insurance, a government mandate that served as a model for the law Obama and the Democrats enacted last year. Repealing or outlawing "Obamacare" is a priority for Republicans and for Romney, who criticizes it on states-rights grounds, even as he defends the Massachusetts law as a success.

The aggrieved writer rightly contends that a 400-word limit allows space for more letters to be published. Fair enough. However, I find many letters on the local editorial page are imported from a sister newspaper. The reality appears to be, not too much, but not enough local text. Perhaps more, not less, local text is needed.

Upside: Was one of the fastest players in college football and plays the ball well with at least six pass break-ups in three of his seasons. Active player who had 52 tackles from the secondary in 2010 to go with 49 tackles in 2008. High enough character that he was named a team captain this past season despite the fact he was out for the year. Can also play in the return game.

The writing section of the SAT and ACT can serve as a style comparison as well. Colleges can request copies of the essay if the student submits the scores to that college. Some colleges like to have the test essays. Others don't. It depends on their philosophy.
5. Fife Symington fraud conviction: Fife Symington served as governor from 1991 to 1997. He resigned in 1997 after being convicted by a federal jury of bank and wire fraud. His conviction was overturned on appeal in 1999, and President Bill Clinton pardoned him in 2001.
Experts at the running injury clinic at a local university did a full work-up, including a treadmill gait analysis. The verdict: Insufficient hip strength was causing my ankles to bend inward upon landing. It wasn't the distances that had done me in, it was the speed, which causes a significantly higher impact. Speed kills.

"It changes games. It can win games," Molina said. "Any time you see a catcher throw to first base, you've got to second guess and be careful how you take the lead and be more careful taking another base. If it's Albert here or not, I'm trying to be that same guy."

When asked what he did if the ticker-tape machine broke, Ernie replies that sometimes he'd make up a distraction, like a dog running on the field. And he'd have that dog racing back and forth, eluding escape, until the machine was fixed.
Hey P.: I think the Browns would be more likely to move up and take RG3 at No. 2 then to draft Blackmon at No. 4. If the Browns didn't draft Julio Jones at No. 6 last season, I doubt they'd pick Blackmon at No. 4. Besides, I expect Tannehill's stock to climb and he'll likely be gone by No. 22.

The proposed Cove Point facility will rely on increased fracking in the Marcellus shale, a gas-rich geologic formation under parts of Maryland, Ohio, New York, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Intensifying interest in this shale is particularly bad news for Pennsylvania, where already-weak safeguards to protect people's air, water and health just became even less sturdy. A new law forced through the state legislature by pro-drilling lawmakers and industry lobbyists takes away local municipalities' authority to protect their residents and allows drilling companies to start fracking just a football field's length away from their children's schools, the local hospital, or people's backyards.
Most of us came from Southern California and toil in cubicles for a living, but now we were cowboys. We headed out on a five-mile ride along the John Muir Trail to our campsite near Purple Lake.

“We’d love to do that and we’re going to have to do it against the best team in the NHL over the course of the regular season, so it’s going to be a tough hurdle for us, but we like the challenge. This time of year you’re going to have to play everyone if you want to get to where you want to be. I think it starts with a group of players and, obviously, leadership above, as well as the coaching staff.”
But that's an issue that doesn't faze Cruz.
"We've had a lot of hours where we've spent with investigators. When we're not working with the investigators or the investigation directly, it's working with all the people in the community, all the volunteers, thanking as many people as we can, focusing on efforts to get his face out. That's where our focus has been," Kaine Horman said. "It's just not given us a lot of time to put a lot of thought into statements to the public."
Griffis notes, “If you get to a point where you have a species of trout that depend on cold water, but the temperature is going to rise enough to where the stream won’t be able to sustain it, what actions should be taken?

Police responded and filed a report.
The key to changing habits is not to avoid the cues or to change the rewards, most research shows. Rather, it involves changing the routine that leads from cue to habit. Duhigg notes that he was gaining weight, at least in part, because every afternoon at 3:30 he would break and go get a chocolate chip cookie. A series of experiments, such as having tea instead, chatting with colleagues or taking a brisk walk, indicated that what he really wanted was a break from work and interaction with colleagues. Instead of getting a cookie, he started taking 10 minutes to chat and found that he got the same reward from the activity. The cue stayed the same and the reward was similar, but the routine was markedly different.

He was sober for six years. We got married three years into his sobriety. We have two children. His drinking made him lose his job last summer and now he does odd jobs. He is still in total denial about his drinking and simply tells me he is a loser.
If Oden somehow actually gets declared "100%" before next season, and wants to be respected amongst fans, he would come back to Portland for a very modest salary to redeem his reputation and career. It is the perfect line-up for him to contribute to, and after a few good games Blazer fans would be chanting his name (again).

But they also taught me to love and to care for others. They taught me to see Jesus in everyone I meet.

Cornelius leaders knew 15 years ago that the roads needed upgrades. The town of 11,000 has the highest rate of low-income and Latino residents in the county -- two groups likely to include more walkers because of cultural or financial reasons.
