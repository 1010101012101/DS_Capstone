On our last morning in town, we grabbed breakfast at the Kootenay Bakery Café (vegetarian), then watched as the real firefighters of Nelson — an entirely competent-looking bunch, noses unremarkable — fanned out from their truck, shut down Baker Street and sent a man skyward on the ladder. His task: to string up a banner for an upcoming event.

The Grammys, which took place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, attracted 39 million viewers — the second largest audience in its history. (Only the 1984 ceremony was watched more widely). Undoubtedly, the number was boosted by curiosity about how Whitney Houston, who died on Saturday, would be honored and how Adele, who has been battling voice problems in recent months, would sound.
Though Manchester United currently has no single player on the star level of Jordan, its rich history, global branding and 19 league titles have created a following that, like those Bulls teams, cuts across racial and economic lines. The shrieks from fans standing -- sometimes in the rain -- outside the club's luxury hotel in downtown Seattle sounded eerily similar to some of those I heard in the late 1990s for the Bulls.
Portman, shot mostly in close-up and mid-range, appears to be doing much of the dance work herself, and ably. Members of the Pennsylvania Ballet lend verisimilitude and artistry to the proceedings, and the staging of "Swan Lake's" climactic scenes, truly a transcendent fusion of music, dance, and cinema, is thrilling to behold.
Testifying outside the presence of the jury, Davis cited the Innocence Project study's finding that false confessions were taken in a sizable chunk of 300 or so cases where DNA evidence exonerated wrongly accused defendants.

Epilepsy, which affects 1% of the U.S. population, is a seizure disorder involving a surge of electricity in the brain. Its cause often isn't known, but in children the condition may be congenital or the result of a head injury. When medications can't control seizures, alternative treatments may be attempted, including surgery, strict diets and brain-stimulation techniques. But these have had limited success, according to the Epilepsy Foundation, a patient-advocacy group.

Given that Kidd's NBA career has led him into the playoffs for 16 straight seasons, the notion of joining the Warriors always seemed absurd - until now. Kidd's Dallas Mavericks are about to be blown out of the playoffs by Oklahoma City, which leads the first-round series 3-0. The Mavericks will spend the summer on a desperate mission to lure Deron Williams away from Brooklyn (formerly New Jersey).

The Cowboys have maintained that Romo suffered only a bruised right hand when it nailed Jason Babin’s helmet on his second throw in the loss a week ago yesteray against the Eagles. But the hand was badly swollen, and Romo didn’t return to the game — though it turned out to be meaningless anyway — and it could very well be worse than the Cowboys are letting on. Either way, the injury should have an impact tonight in what will be a chilly night in the Meadowlands. Romo was limited in practice all week and wore a black glove for much of it, though he said he won’t wear a glove tonight. He’ll try to gut through what is sure to be discomfort on every throw, but don’t expect him to air it out like he did against the Giants three weeks ago in Dallas.

"The toughest game. Probably right at the top. I can’t think of another team that really played us this well on both sides of the ball. The Charger game was close, but we really had a good rhythm. I think that the Giants defense did a really good job of getting us out of some stuff and hitting me a number of times. But we just made enough plays at the end to get the job done."

"Why should Lady Thatcher have any interest in meeting Palin? Even if the Iron Lady were not in such rusty health, what would be the point or purpose of any such encounter? What possible interest could she have in meeting a two-bit, half-term governor of Alaska? To ask the question is to make the answer so clear that even Palin's most deluded admirers might be able to understand it. What, assuming the former prime minister were in the habit of receiving guests (which she is not), could they possibly talk about? One is a giant figure; the other, politically speaking, a carnival pygmy better suited to life on a second-rate reality television show," - Alex Massie
It's not like we don't already have a local blueprint for this sort of effort, albeit on a more contained scale.

For Republicans, that impulse to relive the past could have serious implications for 2012, as they seek a compelling contrast to Obama. Consider what happened after the election of Clinton, the first boomer president. Similarly energized then as they are now, and eager to exploit the same kind of cultural friction, Republicans in 1996 nominated the former senator Bob Dole, who, at 73, was an icon of the World War II generation.

By the end of 1776, after a string of defeats on Long Island, Manhattan, and in New Jersey, Washington's troops were in full retreat across New Jersey. That's when Captain Jones, Daniel Bray and members of the Hunterdon militia rounded up boats for Washington's escape across the Delaware. About the same time, early December 1776, John Vought and his father Christopher rode in the other direction with about 75 Hunterdon County loyalists to join the King's forces and fight with the New Jersey Volunteers. Those who joined the British army had their property confiscated by the patriot government. The Hunterdon County commissioners confiscated the Vought homestead in 1779 and auctioned it off –at Jones’ Tavern– to help pay for the war.

The open ceiling gives the place a warehouse-type feel, with exposed wooden beams and even a couple of skylights. Paesanos, simply put, is a blend of midtown.

"Civil unions" and "domestic partnerships" for same-sex couples savor strongly of the injustices of "separate but equal"- have we learned nothing from our past? DOMA serves no purpose other than to perpetuate cycles of dominance and oppression while the Respect for Marriage Act aims to do just the opposite: to proliferate freedom and justice and to sustain the pursuit of happiness for millions. What could be more American than that?

A bonus of our supermarkets tuning in to the desire for local food is that they carry excellent varieties in the cool confines of a produce department for longer storage. A few days at room temperature usually allows superb ripening.

He goes on to note that "Some of us grew up dealing with racial profiling, but this law (SB 1070) takes it to a whole new low. If other states follow the direction of the Arizona government, we could be headed towards a pre-civil rights era reality. This unjust law was set into motion by the same Arizona government that refused to acknowledge Martin Luther King Jr. day as a national holiday. When Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat, they arrested her. As a result, people got together and said we are not going to ride the bus until they change the law. It was this courageous action that sparked the Montgomery bus boycott. What if we got together, signed a collective letter saying, 'We're not going to ride the bus?' "

Few things are more important than educating children, yet we accept this current system the way Soviet citizens accepted long bread lines. No doubt, auditors in that system issued reports discussing ways to shorten the lines.

A: Hey, Joe: The move to expand to Jacksonville and Charlotte was driven by former Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. It was one of the worst decisions he made. I think it had to do more with expanding the NFL brand to virgin markets than saving Baltimore and St. Louis for other owners. I agree that the Colts' history should have been returned to Baltimore and Indianapolis should have been rebooted. But that's easy for anyone other than Irsay to say. There were reports, yes, that he wanted a ransom to give up the Colts' legacy, and I don't blame him. As for your rooting interest, I'm not sure if you meant you were a fan of the Baltimore Colts or the Cleveland Browns. In either case, I would move on and follow your heart. Life's too short.
Brady? We have no idea what kind of candidate he'll be.

Prosecutors scoffed, saying he deserved to go to prison. Federal sentencing guidelines recommend a prison term of as much as six months, but prosecutors said Phillips-Olivier deserved more because he held a position of trust. They also urged Lioi to send a message that lying to federal agents will mean a serious consequence. They said Phillips-Olivier lied when he worked for the Chicago Housing Authority, as he denied to investigators that housing employees had worked at his home.
But if so, it seems surprising that Dayton has been able to reverse the state's decline in just 11 months -- and merely by compromising with the Republican Legislature on another tough, no-tax-hike budget, a budget Dayton himself deplored.

Indonesia accounts for just 1.4% of U.S. beef exports, and the broader reaction has been muted. The top four U.S. beef buyers—Canada, Mexico, Japan and South Korea—haven't moved to curb imports, thanks in part to a rapid response by the federal government and beef-industry groups to assure foreign governments that U.S. beef is safe.

Studies in prestigious journals, such as the New England Journal of Medicine, have documented that media coverage of adolescent suicides increases the rates of such suicides within the readership or viewing area.

Jon Sarkin was torn, from childhood, between a career in medicine, like his father, and the life of an artist. He chose medicine and became a chiropractor. One day in 1988, when Sarkin was 35, golfing with a friend, he felt a sudden twinge in his brain like a switch had flipped. In fact, it had. A blood vessel had shifted, touching his eighth cranial nerve. He was dizzy and disoriented. After months of excruciating tinnitus and unsatisfactory visits to various specialists, Sarkin had deep brain surgery, which brought on a stroke. He emerged from the stroke like a blank canvas, and slowly a new self emerged — the soul of an artist. Sarkin painted obsessively and now, decades later, is an acclaimed artist. (Tom Cruise has purchased the rights to his story.) Amy Ellis Nutt, a journalist, interweaves Sarkin's astonishing story with similar stories of brain trauma and broken identity throughout history. She brings us into the ever-changing world of neurobiology and the slower world of exploration into the nature of self and the soul. Nutt gives us so much to think about — the nature and sources of creativity, the soul and destiny, the strange identities we sometimes wrongly cling to.

But filling out the 100-plus questions on the application for federal student aid can be incredibly challenging or sometimes misleading. One classic FAFSA mistake is listing your primary residence (the home you own and live in) as an asset. Colleges are not supposed to figure home equity into the financial aid equation.

As I started my second try, I was anxiously rehearsing how I would tell my editor this macaron story might not happen - unless she wanted a humor piece. Still, I had a few more tricks up my sleeve.

Dining among the stars is both a heady and enlightening experience. Chefs of this caliber are creative and are constantly seeking new ways to approach food. Each is unique, but in my back-to-back visits to 13 of the Bay Area's top-rated places, I discovered some broad trends. We're likely to see these at more and more restaurants as other chefs experiment with what the elite group has mastered.

Young saw a hand specialist Monday, and Fisher said team doctors recommended the surgery to repair a torn tendon in Young's right thumb, an injury he suffered Sunday.

Worst horror film: Here’s one good reason for a remake: No one saw the original. Here’s another good reason: You’ve got a completely different take on the material.

Strahan gets paid to make controversial statements, and such talk always has come naturally to Owens. What the two are expressing, however, is a widely held belief that it's only a matter of time before Cutler makes a dumb throw that will cost his team.

Former Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer leads the pack of declared candidates but still hasn't qualified for the caucus process. Texas Rep. Ron Paul, a Republican presidential candidate, is the leader among candidates supporters hope to draft; he has been dismissive of a third-party bid.
Larry and Eva Dolan, lawyers both, led dinner-table discussions about politics and government. In games of 20 Questions, Larry Dolan often would pick a historical figure. "My dad was very much into teaching us how our country was formed," said Matt Dolan.

Critics argue sales tax holidays merely shift purchases that would have occurred at another time into one weekend. Moreover, they contend, shoppers frequently don't save money because retailers either don't offer discounts they otherwise would have or even raise prices.
Passengers ride in a row of four people on a so-called enchanted bench (really, a broomstick wouldn't be very comfortable or secure, would it?) An over-shoulder harness lowers to secure them for a twisting journey on a robotic arm that throws riders from side to side, through surging, forward-moving maneuvers and eventually completely on their backs — although never completely upside down.
PAULSBORO — Council members here have moved a bit closer to revamping the Paulsboro Plaza.

The Petersons' attorney admitted their actions weren't "orderly... or approved by the court" but he said the expenses were justified. District Judge David Ten Eyck later ruled that the posthumous check writing created "fraud and accountability concerns."
Despite potential delays associated with playing back digital recordings, they provide the best form of evidence available to juries, Rabner wrote. Though affirming Miller’s conviction, the court ordered a resentencing because Judge Ryan failed to adequately explain his reasons for imposing consecutive 14-year prison terms on the defendant, instead of running them concurrently.

Kaneoka gets an 'A': Harness racing driver Rachel Kaneoka has graduated at Northfield Park. After posting 11 wins and almost $25,000 in earnings, the reinswoman was upgraded from a provisional license to an "A" license. Presiding Judge Bud Teeters said she is only the second woman he has upgraded to "A" status in the 12 years he's been a race judge.
What are the key attractions in Hocking Hills State Park? Here are five:
And the fact that Baltimore leaders' concerns tend toward the parochial doesn't make them altogether invalid. University of Maryland-Baltimore leaders have historically played a major role in Baltimore civic affairs, particularly in the efforts to redevelop the city's west side. If the president of a combined institution was in College Park — a safe bet — he or she wouldn't have the same on-the-ground view of the community around the Baltimore campus and wouldn't likely be invested in the same way in its success.
"I don't know how to put it into words," he said. "I guess you could say it was epic. I mean, I'm very happy for him. We actually have a picture of him hitting it and it's exactly what you want a hitter to look like when he hits the ball."

He said he's worked with psychologists at Harvard and the University of Chicago, talking through the things he can expect, like nightmares.
"You Belong to Me," out Tuesday, is Rose's 12th novel. It's the first in a series set in and around Baltimore, including, in this case, a fictitious village on the Eastern Shore filled with brutal macho boys (and men) and dysfunctional families. It pivots on a psychopath who starts killing for revenge and instantly discovers that he likes it.
The story, by Post-Gazette writer Karamagi Rujumba, is worth a read. I know the story already has caught the attention of at least one possible contender for Cuyahoga executive. A tip of the hat to former Cuyahoga Commissioner Tim McCormack, who alerted county reporter Laura Johnston and me to the article. McCormack has not decided if he will seek the job but his name has been mentioned frequently as a potential candidate.
"It may be higher than some of those of these other cities, but then that doesn't mean they're right" said Mary Furrow, a task force member who also chairs the West Linn-Wilsonville school board. "I think it would be the wrong message to peel it back."
It's too bad so many people - myself included - have little time these days to make the real deals: red sauce that sings of just-picked tomatoes, chicken soup with matzo balls, paellas that are treasure hunts as well as meals (look, here's another scallop!) or fragrant udons filled with fanciful combinations of seafood, mushrooms, Asian greens and fresh-cut noodles.
It was only much later that I learned that there were far more sinister ways to interpret the death of Christ. Through European and church history classes I started to learn about anti-Judaism and anti-Semitism, the religious and secular sides of the same coin of prejudice. I learned that early Christians, at least some of them, pinned the blame for Christ's death on the Jews, not on the Romans, and that this blame had become a source for much of the bigotry and violence against the Jewish people that had followed. It was a horrifying revelation, although I was naïve enough to think that it was a thing of the past.
Amsterdam was even more beautiful than I had imagined, more like a small kingdom than a city, with so much outdoor life, from the cafes to the markets to the boats to the bikes. The tour took us through the Centrum, along the canals that ring the city center. In the warm July sun with the canals glittering under shady green trees, it seemed impossible that anyone would ever want to go indoors.
The home's L-shape allowed firefighters to quickly contain the incident because there was not one continuous attic space, he said. The fire reportedly caused damage to utility areas of the home, but not to living spaces such as the kitchen and bedrooms.
"It was a lot of work," said Henry, who earned the third doubles state title of her career. "It took work from everybody, not just our No. 1 singles or our No. 1 doubles."
In a message addressed to his top lieutenant, bin Laden urged his network to pursue ways to kill Obama with an attack on the presidential aircraft, Air Force One -- a scheme that U.S. intelligence officials said was well beyond the reach of al-Qaida's decimated ranks.

"He comes down and puts the puck through a hole no bigger than the size of a coffee cup," Thomas said. "There's nothing (the goalie) can do. To see him thread the puck into a hole no bigger than the puck itself is just amazing. We've seen him do it all year."
The leader of Britain's coalition government has repeatedly blamed domestic economic problems on weakness in the euro zone, the U.K.'s biggest export market.
But the deadline deal that brought left-handers Tom Gorzelanny and John Grabow from Pittsburgh has paid early dividends.
The duo laugh at comments about their anthology that suppose "the collapse of civilization is near," Ross says. While each "poem" is free for anyone to dissect with a close reading, the book's intention is clearly satire.
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress Thursday that the fragile economy needs government stimulus spending to strengthen the recovery and help reduce unemployment.
Any lengthy absence for Harden could be an even bigger problem for Oklahoma City, which will be seeded ahead of Los Angeles and could meet the Lakers in the second round. The Thunder have designs on a championship run, and the heavily bearded Harden is their most important reserve.
The Rochelle Park resident pleaded guilty to theft of more than $75,000, and official misconduct, before Hudson County Superior Court Judge Mary Costello in December.
Not to miss: Pastas are outstanding -- as is a succulent and smoky rotisserie chicken slathered with walnut aioli. If Whims does a Roman dish, order it. I recently had a marvelous stewed lamb with an artichoke that fell apart in the sauce and could be blissfully consumed in its entirety.
Oregon State will hold a press conference in the Gill Coliseum media room at a to-be-announced time Thursday. There will be no media availability Wednesday night.

But that doesn't satisfy members of the Monroe County Economic Council. They hope a soon-to-be completed economic development plan will build on the area's strong points to speed economic growth and bring more jobs to the county.
The researchers could not, of course, get direct evidence that there was dendrite shrinkage in the med students that was subsequently reversed. But they inferred that this happened, since the results of every other aspect of the studies were so parallel, says study lead author Dr. Conor Liston, a research fellow in the department of psychology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York.

There are many obvious challenges for parents and teachers in this situation, but for the sake of conversation, let's start with clothing: How do adults get kids out of their short shorts, their sweat pants with words stretched across the backside, their low-slung tank tops and the bad T-shirts so they are presentable to members of Congress, White House staffers and the broader population?

A. I never really had a favorite; my favorite was always whichever one I was working on. But no, they all seemed to catch on. Daredevil was one of the weakest for awhile, but it sold enough that we kept going with it until it worked. The X-Men started well, then Jack (Kirby) left and I got a new artist and interest waned — but then I got another good artist, and it picked up. They all go up and down a little bit, depending on who’s writing the stories, who’s drawing the stories.
Wednesday, the crowd that gathered in Newark to celebrate the unveiling of a bronze statue honoring Gibson was considerably smaller. Huddled under a tent in Branch Brook Park to avoid a sudden afternoon rain shower, were about 150 people, including Gov. Chris Christie and other state and local officials, as well as tennis legend Billie Jean King.
The "feeble" result of the Drake prosecution does not bode well for the other cases, although in some of those the government has stronger arguments at its disposal, said University of Maryland law professor Michael Greenberger. He was critical of the government for applying the "overly broad and vague" Espionage Act, which is generally used against spies like Aldrich Ames, to someone who had exposed problems with NSA programs.
A.Evidently, the direction of the train has an effect on the signal timing.
At age 25, the Mt. Vernon, Wash., native is no longer the fresh-faced kid your grandma wants to hug. He is firmly entrenched as a tenured Blue, one of the regular hands.

Taking over the space could have been a turnkey operation, but the Tusks had other ideas. They gutted the dining room and dropped an elegant coved-ceiling box into the middle of the space, creating a lounge in front, a bar on one side and additional seating in back. They also enclosed the open kitchen, which can now be viewed through large plate-glass windows from the sidewalk on Pacific.
The congressional men in those families, Schroeder said she believes, are personally threatened by women in power. Their wives have supported them by hosting receptions, sending holiday cards and smiling at political rallies, and that's the role they see for women.

Echoing what other parents have said, Dewitt insisted the closures would affect property values. Dewitt also questioned whether the district had looked at more hidden costs, such as busing and the general loss of resources.
This is terrible news for the Chargers — bad enough Eli spurned them on Draft Day eight years ago — Raiders and Chiefs, and bad news for the Jets, whether Woody Johnson can continue to insist with a straight Gang Green passed on Peyton face because Mark Sanchez is the Sanshise. It is terrible news for the 49ers, who may now be stuck with unproven Colin Kaepernick and Josh Johnson at quarterback if Alex Smith takes his pedestrian talents elsewhere. It is terrible news for Titans owner Bud Adams, who wanted to build Peyton a wing at the Grand Ole Opry and make Peyton as big as Elvis.

We'll win because: We feel that our band has a real shot at winning the Tri-C High School Rock-Off. We bring a different flavor of music to the stage and when we show the audience that we have dedicated ourselves to (the band) for the page for months, (so) anything can happen. We prefer to write our own songs, but when we cover previous songs, we incorporate our own modifications that change their genre altogether. The fans' votes will prove that we can match any high school band around, no matter their age or experience. We appreciate any supporters and hope to make listeners stop and appreciate our flair.

Now, the foundation to any great pizza is the crust, so the next step was developing the dough. A good crust has to set up and bake quickly in a hot oven, it should be crisp on the outside but tender and slightly chewy on the inside. And it has to carry good flavor without drawing too much attention to itself. The best pizza crusts are the ones you notice only after you're done eating.

It's an ensemble cast, but the clear leader is wiry, manic Blake Bashoff as the sensitive and troubled Moritz.

The Boilermakers (20-5) will be the visiting team and bat first in the neutral-site contest.
"Dralion" follows the same basic framework of the original tent production, which played six sold-out weeks here in 2002. A quartet of performers representing the elements of Earth, Air, Fire and Water act as silent ringmasters to a cavalcade of primarily Asian acrobatic acts, interspersed with a trio of avant-garde clowns, who mess with audience members and bring a twisted sensibility to the otherwise regal proceedings. But many of the acts and almost all of the performers are new to Portland audiences, and the show seems more fresh and tight now.

By the time the film hit, Taylor had already married — and divorced — hotel heir Conrad “Nicky” Hilton. (She would wed six more men — one of them twice — before she died.) She was now, clearly, an adult. Yet MGM didn’t know what to do with her, assigning her leads in nothing-much movies (“Love Is Better Than Ever”) or supporting parts in costume epics (“Ivanhoe”).

This battle round amply demonstrated what a liability it is to be in Team Blake --- he chose a Billy Ocean song to sing. Really, Blake? You're gonna be THAT stuck in the '80s, are you? Jermaine, already a successful back-up singer for Alicia Keys, was polished enough that advisor Kelly Clarkson invited him to sing on her own tour if he didn't win "The Voice."

Wes Bunting, National Football Post: "The Rams needed to upgrade their level of talent at the DT position and Brockers has what it takes to mature into one of the league's best. He's a former 4-start, 255-pound SLB prospect out of high school who has since gained over 70-pounds and developed into one of the SEC's top linemen. He needs to mature as a pass rusher, but he has the skill set to do so and should be able to anchor the run at a high level early on."
