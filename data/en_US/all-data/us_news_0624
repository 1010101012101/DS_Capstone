But then she grows up. Chiyo is renamed Sayuri (Ziyi Zhang) and comes under the tutelage of a benevolent older geisha, played by Michelle Yeoh, and the rest of the movie traces Sayuri's emergence as a geisha, her tribulations and her never-ending longing for the Chairman. The movie becomes bloated, giving us a crash course in geisha artistry and customs, as well as a tour through the history of Japan in the 1930s and 194os as seen through a geisha's eyes.

Do you think Martz is finally getting it? To lead two offensives -- Rams and Bears -- differently from each other will actually enhance his reputation and not harm it. It seemed last year he was trying to recreate the famed Rams offense and corrected himself just in time and then at the start of the year he tried to recreate the Rams offense again until finally realizing these Bears are different. Why not be known as a great offensive coordinator leading two offensives differently? To me, that would be very satisfying and probably garner a lot of respect around the league, resulting in Martz being known as the offensive genius he seems to want to be known as. -- David Phillips, Orlando, Fla.

Huffington is sort of right -- the Obama ad is pretty despicable -- but not for the reasons she suggests. In an appearance on "CBS This Morning," Huffington compared the spot to Hillary Rodham Clinton's "3 a.m. phone call" ad from the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination contest, which implied that we could all sleep safer knowing that if the White House phone rang at 3 a.m. with some kind of crisis, Clinton (rather than Obama) would be the one to pick it up. "There is no way to know whether Romney would have been as decisive," Huffington huffed. "And to actually speculate that he wouldn't be is, to me, not the way to run campaigns on either side."

With “The Hunger Games” getting the theatrical treatment this weekend (you may have read about it), it seems only fitting that a game would be next to follow. Where there hasn’t been a console or PC title announced for “The Hunger Games,” it seems almost inevitable. In the meantime fans can satiate themselves with "The Hunger Games: Girl on Fire" for iOS. This free running game has Katniss dashing through the forest, tossing arrows in to tracker jackers and, as one might expect in a “Hunger Games” product, trying not to die. I’m so horrible at this game. If I were a real tribute, the game makers would’ve given me a 1 out of 12. Give it a try and see if the odds are in your favor.

As for the tower, the futuristic shell hides an old-fashioned desire to link people with their environment. It is sited in such a way as to allow in a generous amount of natural light, which explains the perforated panels of stainless steel (some of which will open and close) that will cloak the southern face to keep direct sunlight from overheating the interior. And the narrow width means windows can be opened and closed to let natural air circulate through the offices.

We went back and forth as to what was going on. They understand it’s a business just like I understand it’s a business. If anything happens, in the event that I am traded or released, it’s not going to be bad. They would probably be doing it for my own good, in actuality, so I’ll be happy with anything that happens.”

The bill before the House is the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, known as CISPA. It has the best of intentions, to bolster the nation's defense against the very real threat of cyberattacks. But Democrat Lofgren is right when she argues it gives the government far too much access to the online data of every American Internet user. Paul's criticism goes even further, saying it makes "government spies" of companies such as Google and Facebook. He says it would allow them to share all kinds of information with the government, including members' emails, the websites they visit and the medical, educational and financial records they may have online.
Jurors told reporters afterward that their deliberations were thorough and cordial, and that Jennifer Hudson's celebrity didn't influence them. They said it took time to piece everything together, and that a key was cellphone records showing Balfour was in the area when the killings happened.

Slatkin led a strongly focused performance Friday, maintaining tension from start to finish.

* An alarming drop in walk rate. As Cardinals fans know, Pujols was a walking machine. But that began to change in 2011, and it's been even more pronounced so far in 2012. Pujols walked on 16.4 percent of his plate appearances in 2009, 14.7 percent in 2010, only 9.4 percent in 2011, and the walk rate is 6.1 this season. That's more than a 50 percent drop from 2009. That can't be dismissed. Pujols' strikeout rate is 14.3 percent this season. That would be the highest of his career. His walk/K ratio of 0.43 is easily the worst of his career to this point.

I can't remember the count, but Boudreau hit a bouncer up the middle that just barely eluded shortstop Snuffy Stirnweiss racing to his left. When the ball went through, the noise was so loud the stadium started to vibrate as if an earthquake had hit. Fans were crying and shouting and stamping their feet. The roar went on for at least five minutes, and play was suspended because the Yankees were standing and looking at the crowd in disbelief, I think. I can still "feel" the stands vibrating as I write this.

Maybe that's a stretch since whatever Carter is talking about doesn't sound as systematic as what apparently happened in New Orleans. But if the Carter-era Vikings -- who certainly could have reached the Super Bowl any of the three years from 1998-2000 -- were doing it, too, it's interesting to at least think about for an ESPN minute.

Woody's Waterfront: We can thank the hurricane of 1928 for Woody's Waterfront outdoor restaurant. It dates nearly as far, to 1946, when it was just a tiny bait house for anglers doing their thing along Blind Pass, a rocky little inlet carved out by that ferocious storm. Back then it was burgers and dogs. It's still burgers and dogs, and on an average weekend, the place is packed. Servers hustle through the patio, tight-set with high-gloss picnic tables and turquoise sun umbrellas, no one making it look easy as beers are dispensed, orders taken. Meanwhile, Tom Davis or another regular slides through a repertoire of familiar sing-alongs (live music six nights a week, usually a single guy who manages to sound like a whole band), and regulars settle in for a casual, waterside good time amid the condos.

"Understand" is a convincing trip into the mind of an untrammeled genius; it's also the funniest story in the book. Leon's old friends ask if he wants to see a movie, but his preference is for a spot of rarefied theater, a "monologue in verse" that "alternates between four different meters." Later, he tries his hand at his own brand of supersaturated poetry, "employing six modern and four ancient languages……Each line of the poem contains neologisms, born by extruding words through the declensions of another language." And then it comes time for him to develop an entirely "new language," as all the human ones are too paltry to serve as viable forms of expression. The description of awesome mental superiority veers tantalizingly close to a portrait of insanity:

Las Vegas Events is a private, not-for-profit organization that serves as the exclusive major special events agency for the city. Founded in 1983, LVE is funded by hotel room tax.

Since 1991, Las Vegas Events has produced, presented or supported more than 600 events.
It's very dangerous, probably foolhardy, to think the addition of one or two veterans is going to bring a team to the Super Bowl -- especially if the player is one who is not counted on to touch the ball more than five or six times a game. If you look at the history of veteran free agency, you could safely say only two additions have had a direct impact on a team winning a Super Bowl. Reggie White signed with the Packers in 1993, and they won it all three years later. And Drew Brees helped bring a Super Bowl to New Orleans in 2009 after signing in 2006. If any team wins a Super Bowl as the result of a 2012 addition, though, it will be the Broncos.
Thirteen faces grace this photo: 11 sons and daughters plus mom and dad, each and every one a restaurateur. The parents had a restaurant in Thailand; of the children, some have restaurants in England, some in Manhattan, some in Jersey. Mom’s cooking, says Petom, inspired everyone; many of the recipes are hers. (Petom, by the way, is a shortened version of his actual first name, which is too long to fit on a credit card.)

As an aside: I once served a church as a youth minister. The kids told me that the previous pastor had promised to eat a gold fish if they got 100 kids or more to youth group. I told them I preferred my fish broiled with a side of lemon. Anyway, once he managed to get 100 kids to youth group, he soon left the church for other pastures. By the time I got there, many of the kids were gone, too.

We've seen this script play out before. Under the notorious government COINTELPRO program of the 1960s and '70s, police and FBI operatives would infiltrate civil rights and anti-war organizations and, finding nothing that could justify surveillance let alone repression, would invent or actively encourage violence and other illegal actions.
"There could be a number of different outcome possibilities," Philpot said. "The very best would be that every symptom or phenotype of Angelman syndrome goes away, except perhaps the smiling, which I hope all of these individuals keep forever."

Why they could win it: In a field where everyone else was at full strength, it stood to reason that SU couldn’t get by without key shot-blocker and rebounder Fab Melo. Now?

2000 ... OF SHAUN BOYD (13th overall): The Cardinals viewed Boyd as a potential leadoff type, who had experience at second base but projected better at center field. He was the first high school position player taken by the Cardinals since 1991, and right from the start his progress was halting. Boyd topped out at Triple-A, when forced there. He appeared at the level again with Philadelphia before fading into independent baseball, where he hit .343/.439/.545 in 38 games with Camden in 2008. Two picks after the Cardinals took Boyd, the Phillies selected Chase Utley. Though the draft did produce a major-league starting pitcher in Chris Narveson (second round). Boyd is believed to be out of baseball. Grade: F.

For the Russian plan, the search engine results varied widely, from $5,199 on Kayak to $1,373 on Vayama. Then I contacted Bella's Travel (212-730-1010) in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn's Russian enclave. The receptionist asked "Do you have a visa?" I hadn't thought of that, and it turns out they are tricky to get -- but Bella's could help, for $70 in addition to the visa fee. She then sent me over to a very pleasant agent named Alla, who conjured up a $1,301 fare. Total time spent: 15 minutes, much less than I spent online.

Here is what you need to know about Tice’s offensive history: The Vikings employed a fullback only one of the four seasons he was the head coach there. Tice was largely responsible for Jim Kleinsasser making the transition from fullback to tight end (or H-back) and the club primarily used him as a lead blocker when needed. Tice had a true fullback in 2003: Charles Stackhouse. In 2002, 2004 and 2005 the Vikings did not have a fullback on the roster, according to profootballreference.com. That is a decent indicator of what vision Tice has for the Bears.

"Disguised as a deficit reduction plan, it's really an attempt to impose a radical vision on our country," Obama will say at an Associated Press luncheon, according to excerpts of his remarks released by the White House.
