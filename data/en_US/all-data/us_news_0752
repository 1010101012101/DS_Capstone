Earthquakes arise from the collision of massive sections of the earth's crust, called tectonic plates. From Northern California to British Columbia, an ocean-spanning slab called the Juan de Fuca Plate is plunging beneath the North American plate.

Fair warning: This is not the place to come if carbs have been banned from your diet. It would be almost impossible to resist ordering a pizza as they sail by practically under your nose, wafting the good smells of tomato and garlic and fresh-baked bread. Samson is no newcomer to pizza. He developed the pizzas at David Myers' Pizzeria Ortica in Costa Mesa, which were, under his tenure, hands down, the best in the county and certainly the most authentic. Pollack put in some time there too, and with that experience behind them, Sotto's pizzas show off what the two have learned about dough and working with a wood-fired oven.
In its summary of what storm survey crews found, the Weather Service notes that "remarkably, there were no fatalities with this event. This can be attributed to the 34 minutes of tornado warning lead time, wall-to-wall media coverage, and the actions of those in the direct path of the tornado."
"I'm sort of hiding under my desk when the calls come in," said Ashner, noting he still wanted to learn more about the contenders. "I don't see a dynamic candidate out there yet. A number of them have interesting credentials, but they just strike me as a little lackluster."

The free event, open to the public, is titled "Fishing for Words: the Pacifica Pier Poetry Walk." It is a poet-within awakening project created by Bay Area author and San Francisco State University creative writing professor, and Pacifican, Toni Mirosevich, in a partnership with Pacifica's Environmental Family, to "celebrate the iconic--and sometimes ironic--Pacifica Pier." While participating poets stroll the Pier, Pacifica's-own Seaside Singers will add an ocean of melody to the day from their satchel of nautical songs.

Those were the things Elvin Harris couldn't do because of cataracts in both eyes. Already suffering from astigmatism, Harris says he could barely see three feet ahead of him. Instinct is how he pursued his on-again, off-again job as a landscaper.
Traditionally, these characteristics of rye are dealt with in a few ways. Rye is lightened with a bit of wheat flour, to lend some gluten. Or it's baked into unrisen crispbread or dense, thinly sliced canapé loaves, where the lack of loft is an asset. Alternately, rye is leavened with a sourdough, whose acidic properties deactivate the amylases before they can break things down (while also extending freshness and encouraging digestibility).

Teague missed an open 3 for the Hawks, giving Pierce a look at the go-ahead shot. But his 18-foot jumper with Johnson in his face barely touched the bottom of the net, falling harmlessly out of bounds while Pierce looked around in disbelief, believing he must have been fouled.
Hey, I do this for a living, so even though "snafu" suggested something horrible, I was going to eat whatever came out of the kitchen. For aspiring restaurateurs or would-be wordsmiths out there, however, it's probably best not to suggest that your customers will be risking their lives by ordering your food. I might have gone with "scheduling mix-up" over "snafu" because it turns out the chef was a no-show.

This cast, a mix of out-of-towners and Kansas City-based performers, gets the most out of the material. Cordes is unaffected but driven by some sort of inner motor that always keeps him in the moment. Kalahurka is appealing and fun to watch as Logainne. Long plays it straight, more or less, as Olive and delivers a nice performance grounded in reality. Coffman demonstrates adept timing and an amusing depiction of a kid overwhelmed by the sudden impulses of puberty. And Morris is a crisp, controlled but touching Marcy.
Maritana Grill: Since its completion in 1928, the Don CeSar — that big, Pepto Bismol-pink beachside confection — has been a special-occasion dining destination. The King Charles used to be the big-deal dining room at the hotel. These days it's for private functions and the lavish Sunday brunch, the Maritana Grill downstairs having been transformed into the fine-dining digs in 1994. Its assets: It's an intimate, clubby room sporting big fish tanks in case the conversation flags. In other words, it's not a strangulating-necktie, which-spoon-do-I-use fussy hotel dining room. Servers follow suit, pairing good knowledge of the menu and meal pacing with a casual chattiness.

Last season: A year after looking like team headed in right direction under Raheem Morris, Bucs did an about-face in 2011, going from 10 wins and narrowly missing playoffs to 4-12 record that included 10 consecutive losses to end last season.

Consumers who might have shrugged off a denied deal in the past are now more inclined to need the discount on a necessity or to justify a night-out. And, to be sure, plenty of retailers have fallen short of marketing promises and forced consumers seeking satisfaction to "escalate" problems -- often inch by painful inch -- up the management flagpole.

But the practical applications of Krav Maga are secondary, in my mind. All I could think about while taking Sarah Fox's surprisingly well-attended morning fitness class at Fight Fit in Middleburg Heights -- one of many offerings including kickboxing and self-defense -- was how effectively it served as exercise.

This year, it sought an extra $4.1 million to hire more lawyers and $8 million for 206 support workers. That would have provided one secretary, investigator and legal assistant for every three attorneys. Currently, there is an investigator for every 6.7, a legal assistant for every 10.84 and a secretary for every five. Lawmakers responded with no more for lawyers and $250,000 more to expand the support staff.

Chris Christie’s proposed $29.4 billion budget, and the hearing became contentious when Senate Majority Leader Barbara Buono asked about tax-incentive legislation aimed at spurring job growth proposed by Democrats. Sidamon-Eristoff likened the Democrats’ approach to "a cruise ship all-you-can-eat buffet" and said Christie would not sign their bills.

The worst part for me is that, because there is already a theological and chronological association between Passover and Easter, the holiest time of the year became the most dangerous time for Jews. Passover was when these supposed crimes took place, and also Holy Week was when it was easiest to foment hatred against Jews-you simply had to get people to believe that "they" were the ones shouting, "Crucify him!"

In fact, park biologist Skip Snow, who discovered the python-gator standoff, brought along a big black box to Thursday's Everglades tour.

These months aren't slow for the 56-year-old Yost. He hunts most mornings and solves problems most afternoons. The problem on this day, two weeks before Yost reports to Surprise, Ariz., for his third season as manager, is that raccoons have been eating the eggs of wild turkeys. In Yost's faraway world, this is a big deal. If there are no eggs, there are no turkeys, and if there are no turkeys, he and his friends cannot shoot them.

With more than 110,000 people awaiting the gift of an organ in the United States, health professionals know they can ill afford to squander the chance that a grieving family will say "yes" to organ donation.

The main issue may be a big backlog of cases, said Dr. Doug Rollins, professor of pharmacology and toxicology at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City: “Funding to most of these labs has been decreased,” he said, “so they don’t have the staff to handle that large of a caseload.”

The surveys of voters in Maryland's and Wisconsin's GOP presidential primaries were conducted for AP and the television networks by Edison Research. They included preliminary results among 1,153 voters interviewed today as they left polling places at 25 randomly selected sites in Maryland, and among 1,063 Wisconsin voters as they left 35 polling places across that state. Results from both states had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
This is the second of two laws designed to keep local agencies from banning the contracts that set standards for wages, local hiring and health coverage for workers on a project - which usually lead to use of union labor. This bill prevents all charter cities - including those three local municipalities - from receiving state funds for projects if they ban the contracts in any way.
"There are certain things that were going bad that are improving, but the bad news is I still haven't gotten rid of the E. coli," he said. "It's not spreading, that's good. I'm just not rid of it, which means it's probably stuck in the prostate. It's very hard to get rid of an infection in the prostate."
Only New York and California did worse than Illinois in the eighth annual survey of the Best and Worst States in which to do business, which asked 650 business leaders to grade states in a variety of areas including taxes, workforce and environment.

Some people living near well sites have complained that their well water has been contaminated by fracking. The industry asserts that tiny amounts of chemicals are used in fracking and that the water problems are unrelated to the procedure.
Student anger has simmered as lawmakers have repeatedly cut funding for higher education in their struggle to balance the state's books, and as the universities have responded by raising tuition and fees. The Cal Grants program, which awards state funds to qualifying students at public and private universities, has also been targeted. Thousands marched on the Capitol last week in one of the largest student demonstrations there in recent years, and dozens were later arrested for trespassing.

Coulthard "has a vision for where the agency must go" and has made significant progress, said Robert Wilson of Sacramento Child Advocates, a nonprofit legal group that represents foster children. "It goes without saying that additional cuts to CPS will result in an increased danger to children and in the deaths of children who did not have to die."
The “relatively mundane facts” of the case — the man was a suspect in a minor-injury hit-and-run traffic crash — “belie the magnitude of the constitutional right and the significance of the constitutional issue,” the court wrote.

About two hours after the birth, a nearby resident spotted the towel - and what she thought were abandoned puppies wrapped inside - and called police. The baby is now in custody of the Department of Social Services and is expected to be adopted.
More taxes might be on the way. The Obama administration's deficit reduction plan includes increasing the passenger security fee, now between $5 and $10 per flight, to $15, with the possibility of future increases. Of the $24.9 billion the fee would raise over the next decade, $15 billion would be funneled toward reducing the national debt.

Day 1 also featured my first go at the weight machines. Siebert did her best to be patient as I dragged from station to station. I made her late for a meeting because I was so slow. The initial "workout'' was as hard as anything I've ever done fitness-wise. For most people in the gym that day, it probably would have been easy.

Upgrades at Bedford and Richmond cost a total of $65,000 and can be seen in every ER room -- 12 in each facility -- so all patients, regardless of age, can benefit. The rooms have soft lighting, pressure-reducing mattresses, high-back chairs for better support, larger signage, big clocks, and nonskid floors and handrails to prevent falls. Senior patients in the rooms will have ready access to devices that amplify hearing and magnify printed materials.

Money, no surprise, is a problem. Gov. John Kitzhaber's initial 2011-13 budget proposal cuts Oregon State University's network of farm and forest research stations and extension services by about $20 million, nearly a 19 percent reduction. The Legislature may reduce the cut, or find some money to add back, but nothing is certain.
The report also found lax oversight by the rig's flag state, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, a Pacific nation where Transocean registered the Deepwater Horizon in 2005. It said the Coast Guard should ramp up its inspections of such foreign-flagged drilling rigs.

"It is certainly one of the most restrictive and misguided policies that I have seen," Shibley said. He said the policy is so broad that it could restrict professors from participating in interviews about their research, for example.

"I want (tech companies) to start here in San Francisco, and I want them to stay and to grow," Lee said while being interviewed onstage at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference last September.

"Was I wrong by pulling her hair? ABSOLUTELY. Did I have good intentions behind my actions? YES, I was defending my mother. Danielle is very calculated, and she has a way of bringing out THE ABSOLUTE WORST in people. Was it all Danielle that night? Of course not, at the end of the night, it was MY decision to lay a hand on her. I acted without thinking. I paid my dues, and I learned my lesson." Notice that she doesn't say she's sorry. She also admits she was disrespectful to her parents when they tried to talk to her about her actions. "Keep in mind this was filmed months ago, and since then I have grown a lot, and I'm still growing. I'm only 19, I have time to correct my flaws. I am not proud of this episode at all. I am not happy with the way I looked at all. I have definitely learned a lesson from all of this. You learn and grow with each choice you make."

In 1999, a charter jet crash killed pro golfer Payne Stewart and four others and flew halfway across the country on autopilot before crashing in a pasture in South Dakota. Everyone on board had apparently lost consciousness for lack of oxygen after a loss of cabin pressure, and the plane crashed after it ran out of fuel, investigators said.

"Bluehour" evokes a moment, the time when the afternoon darkens and the evening comes on, and feelings shift into a more sensual mood. Over its 10 years, Bluehour has steadily produced magical moments, from watching the evening fall on outside cocktail tables to a bar area where the crowds and the cocktail shakers get livelier as the evening gets later.
Whether the interests are biking or running, softball or soccer, local college sports experts warn that a rush to regain fitness in time for warmer months can be too much, too soon.

Nearby neighbor Carol Payne, for example, said this: "I'm just pleased that Dennis is trying to preserve some kind of history. � My husband and I are all for it." At the same time, Payne said, most residents are "anti-boat" when it comes to the Shawnee.
Park View is facing a Dec. 31 deadline imposed by its regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision. It would seem unlikely the capital will be in hand by that date, but a concrete plan and the filing of documents to sell the stock would be the next-best thing.
The statement, in part, declares: "HBO Studio heads decided they would generate more profit by inventing facts and scenes for the purpose of fictionalizing a history written by people with no personal knowledge of the situations they attempt to depict."
Merida also hosts smaller siblings of Merida en Domingo every night of the week. "I love to go to big-band night in Santiago Park on Tuesday or to Santa Lucia on Thursday (for live music and dance, with some poetry) and watch the locals dancing and enjoying themselves," says Suzan Haskins, a writer for International Living magazine.
Medicare Part B, on the other hand, which covers outpatient care, will cost you a monthly premium. If your employer has 20 or more employees, you can delay signing up without incurring a penalty. Many working seniors choose not to pay for Medicare Part B (as well as Part D, for prescription drugs) coverage because it duplicates their employer's plan.
The study examined the heart rate of workers at a suburban office outside of Boston. Some of the workers were asked to go about their email-filled days as usual, others were asked to step away from email for a full five-day workweek. The researchers fitted both groups with wearable heart rate monitors capable of taking heart rate measurements second by second.
Maybe your success is due to something you got from the government, like a broadcast license, or a new freeway through your property, or a special tax break. Maybe it's due to having been educated at a public university, or having had your education financed through federal student loans. Maybe it's just because you're an American. The average American baker earns more than twice what a baker earns in Poland and five times what a baker earns in China (and I imagine the bread and the working conditions are better too). What's true for bakers is true for bankers: Operating in a rich country is more lucrative than operating in a poor one. And this is for reasons having nothing to do with admirable personal characteristics.
Prince Fielder seems likely to depart Milwaukee as a free agent. And his MVP cohort, Ryan Braun, is facing a 50-game suspension after testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug.
øDebt settlement might require you to put money into a dedicated bank account that's administered by a third party. Some charge a percentage of the total debt - such as 15% or 18% - while others charge a percentage of the debt savings or a flat monthly fee. Debt settlement can cost more than hiring a lawyer to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, says a recent report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.

Compared with the ex-mayor, Mel Katz is a background presence in his son's book. He is depicted as leading by example, the way he's done for generations of art patrons and for students at Portland State University. Vera Katz's career took place in the middle of the public arena; her ex-husband worked in the artistic edges. As much as she was a pioneer for women in politics, he was a leader in bringing art and culture to a city that didn't have much of either when the Katzes arrived in 1964. He started teaching at the Museum Art School (now the Pacific Northwest College of Art) and moved to PSU for a teaching career that ended in 1998. He's never retired from art and continues to find beauty through hard work.

One key to deficit reduction is a realistic baseline to determine a common starting point for revenue. I was impressed by the work of the Simpson-Bowles commission and by the work of the so-called Gang of Six in the Senate because they realistically assumed that some expiring tax provisions will be extended — but not all of them. This baseline also assumes that we have to bring in additional revenues.

But your neighbors don't get to use your bathrooms. They do benefit from your trees. Donovan's study (PDF) found the average street tree increases the value of adjacent homes -- those within about 100 feet of the tree -- by a total of roughly $13,000. "What it means is, because you have someone bearing all the costs but not getting all of the benefits, you have too few trees from a community perspective," Donovan says.
Let's just hope our politicians keep expanding the group of people they want to serve. Rather than embracing Christian as the magic word of politics, we can move on to the truly magical word: American. And maybe we can even go a step further and make the magic word "humanity."
Down the coast at Bay City, the winds as of 1:30 a.m. Dec. 3 barreled unhindered across Tillamook Bay, slamming into the Bay City firehouse where firefighters -- as the building threatened to splinter apart -- wrote down the peak wind gust: 129 mph.
"We submitted a new policy long ago, but it has gone nowhere. We suggested that, if the number of problem bear incidents, the "Category One" bear cases, don’t go down, we’d have a hunt. But the Corzine administration and the DEP does not want a hunt," said Len Wolgast, a game council member and former wildlife biology professor at Rutgers University.

He never checks a watch or wonders what might be in the news; he cleans his knife, milks his goat and cleans his son's bottom by dipping him in a burbling stream. Yet with his world in conflagrations and a newborn in his care, he'll have to adapt. When he encounters a shopwoman in town it's tense: Will she show him kindness? In fact, he falls — or is steered by the angel — into the hands of several women who can offer him assistance. But when that same shopwoman comes face to face with the Colonel, who has both a powerful malevolence and a silver tongue, it's not clear that anyone will be able to protect Bright from him.
A Eurocontrol volcanic ash map on Tuesday listed the airspace between Iceland, Britain and Ireland as a no-fly zone, along with much of the area around the Baltic Sea. The ash cloud also spread westward from Iceland, toward Greenland and Canada's eastern coastline.
Ameren sought to make up the loss in part by entering into a 100-megawatt, 15-month contract with American Electric Power Service Corp. and a 150-megawatt, 18-month contract with Wabash Valley Power Association Inc. The agreements ran through May through November 2010, respectively.
The shooting occurred about 11:20 p.m. as the truck driver and victim were helping to clean up after the fundraiser. The gun, a Cobra Derringer, was in the truck driver's coat pocket. The man picked up his coat as he prepared to leave the church. The gun fell out of his pocket, hit the floor and fired. The bullet struck the victim, seated at the next table, in the back and exited through his chest.

Springsteen, who brought his band to the Garden State for the first time on his current Wrecking Ball Tour — and for the first time since the death of saxophonist Clarence Clemons — draws strength from the Jersey swamps. He fishes poetry out of their marshes and finds the weary dignity in the facilities that squat there. He was there to christen the opening of the Izod Center (then the Brendan Byrne Arena) with six shows in 1981; more than 30 years later, he’s still the arena’s most reliable draw.

But research by the non-partisan Public Policy Institute of California has shown that relatively few jobs move into or out of the state in any given year. Although numbers are not available for the most recent years, data for 1992 through 2006 showed that about 16,000 jobs per year moved into California from elsewhere while 25,000 moved out. That's a net decline of about 9,000 jobs per year, a tiny fraction of the state's base of more than 15 million jobs overall.

Detroit elections have always been tricky. The city elections department must plan for hundreds of thousands of residents to vote when sometimes only tens of thousands do. But the low voter turnout doesn't mean the staff can plan for a smaller election.
Steve Serby, New York Post: "Even if Tebow sells a few thousand PSLs, even if he gets the Jets the coveted Back Page every now and then in a town where the Super Bowl Giants reside, even if he is able to add toughness and leadership and class to a locker room sorely lacking them, was it worth bringing in a Wildcat quarterback/special teamer/jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none who will draw media crowds worthy of a rock star everywhere he walks (on water)? No. Will quarterbacks coach Matt Cavanaugh be able to transform Tebow into a quarterback who could play the position the way it was meant to be played instead of one who throws ducks and completes 46 percent of his passes? Doubtful. Will Tebow operating Tony Sparano's Wildcat keep Bill Belichick up at night? Hardly. But it undoubtedly will keep Sanchez up at night, and playing with the fragile psyche of your young franchise quarterback is risky and treacherous business."

Amid all the grim economic news from Europe, it's worth noting that there are also some success stories. Well, of course, you say: Germany. OK.

Trade-ups also might be necessary to fend off a team that covets Alabama running back Trent Richardson, Oklahoma State receiver Justin Blackmon or LSU cornerback Morris Claiborne -- and that team fears Cleveland wants their player, as well.
Sales taxes can have an outsize effect on lower-income people. "After they buy basic necessities, they typically won't have a lot of money left over to save or invest," says Mr. Wamhoff.

There were moments off the train that gave me pause, such as when a native in the old silver mining town of Batopilas remarked, "Here, we see nothing, we hear nothing and we say nothing if we want to wake up alive each morning." In that same town, where the drug-fighting military keep a high profile, I took pictures of attractive colonial-style building facades before realizing that at least two of them bore more than a dozen deep holes that could have been rendered only by the bullets of a high-powered weapon, the kind favored by Mexican drug traffickers.

But we’re going to stick to the plan. So stay tuned for much more on the above, including the term the Giants’ players and coaches use for Brady’s flinching. Plus, which other quarterback did the same against them recently?

While there's strong demand in science, education and health fields, arts and humanities flounder. Median wages for those with bachelor's degrees are down from 2000, hit by technological changes that are eliminating midlevel jobs.

They don't cook much. What they do cook is good: When they rustle up one of their standard meals — organic chicken in a Maggi-based sauce; broccolini sautéed in garlic, salt and pepper; and organic brown rice — Gibson gives it an A+ for nutrition and declares it delicious. But they need to broaden their repertoire. For anyone in the same boat, Gibson recommends Cooking Light and epicurious.com for a vast array of healthful, easy-to-toss-together meals.
• "Bambi II" Special Edition (Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, rated G, DVD $29.99; Blu-ray Combo $39.99). Speaking of "Bambi": It took the Disney folks some 64 years to come up with a sequel, of sorts, to the original classic. Some of the background work and the character animation is equal to the task, but the story for this direct-to-video release never amounts to more than your standard father-son drama with a romantic rivalry subplot tossed in. Cute, but no king of the forest.

The Boston Celtics' days near the top are dwindling. Yes, you've heard that before. They are, after all, the Hyman Roths of the NBA, dying of the same heart attack for years. But there simply isn't much life left in Doc Rivers' club. The New York Knicks, who have no stomach for slow rebuilds, socked all their money into Carmelo Anthony, Amar'e Stoudemire and Tyson Chandler and bought a lovely sixth-place team for years to come.
The Giants' bread and butter, though, remains the same.

So it all goes away for Stanford: the conference championship, the winning streak (snapped at 17), a shot at the BCS title game, perhaps even the Heisman Trophy for Luck. He'll be a most deserving winner if it comes his way, but Oklahoma State (10-0) now has the inside track to a BCS showdown against LSU, and the Cowboys' quarterback, Brandon Weeden, threw for 423 yards and five touchdowns Saturday in a 66-6 thrashing of Texas Tech.

Modern to postmodern reigns here, with five different museums. I started at Kunsthalle Wien, the edgy contemporary art center. Inside I found "Power Up," a show devoted to 1960s-70s female pop artists. Even edgier than Kunsthalle Wien is its Kunsthalle Wien Project Space, offering a hip terrace cafe and shows with titles often unprintable in family publications.

I trained different muscles of my body, like my shoulder muscles and back muscles, for long periods of time. I had to thrash the weapons around like I knew what I was doing, and it was pretty difficult to get my muscles to memorize and acclimate to the different maneuvers.

Said Delany, "We thought it might be long. Because we are talking about understanding fiscal sanity, academic sanity, competitive mix and need the best possible understanding because if we expand, it's for the next 50 or 100 years. It's not a bowl game or TV arrangement for six years."
"The Beginner's Goodbye," Tyler's 19th novel, features all of these things and more -- there is a ghost -- and less. Just over 200 pages, it is, both in literal weight and narrative complexity, lighter than most of the Tyler canon. Which should not be construed as less, at least not in the pejorative sense of the word.
The play in question came with 6.0 seconds left in fourth quarter and the Blazers leading 103-101. After a timeout, Durant collected a pass on the wing and drove the lane for the game-winning shot, breezing past a screen and defensive switch toward the rim. As he elevated for a layup, however, LaMarcus Aldridge blocked the ball from behind and it bounced off the glass.

Bales was on his fourth overseas deployment when he purportedly went on a homicidal rampage. No one at this point can say definitively to what extent, if any, his alleged actions were influenced by his combat record. But there is no denying reports that he was dismayed at having to go to Afghanistan after he'd already done three tours in Iraq.
State eyes Multnomah County’s governor vote: The race for guv remains too close to call. But it seems to be trending for Kitzhaber. The Oregonian’s political team has been crunching the numbers. Multnomah County, a sea of blue, is the key. Jeff Mapes summarized the numbers late last night. Here’s my back of the envelope look this morning. Dudley leads by 15,411 votes right now, according to Oregonlive. Multnomah County had counted 215,071 ballots as of about 8 a.m. The county reported receiving 280,101 ballots. A few of those will be tossed because they lack signatures. That leaves, say, 278,000 ballots total and roughly 62,929 ballots yet to be counted. Kitzhaber is collecting about 69 percent of all Multnomah County votes and Dudley 28 percent. If things continue at that rate, Kitzhaber would pass Dudley and lead him by about 11,000 votes. There are votes yet to count from other counties, but Dudley would probably have to score huge, huge victories in those counties to pull it out. But that’s just some quick math. Follow Jeff Mapes and Oregonlive for the latest updates today. I’m biased, but we’ve got the best staff in the state pulling data from all corners of the state. Here's the latest from The Oregonian.
Buchanich hopes her full-court press for more participants May 8-10 will change a few minds, but it is looking likely the study will end with far fewer subjects than she had hoped.
Rag & Bone designers Marcus Wainwright and David Neville are also proving to be a formidable force on the New York fashion scene. Their fall collection was English countryside-meets-the-Raj, with layers upon layers of rich-looking pieces, including motorcycle jacket-tailcoat hybrids, jersey dhoti pants, tweed wrap skirts and coppery Lurex knit sweaters, plus all the must-have accessories (such as herringbone platform riding boots) that keep fans coming back to the brand.
In November 2011, Hawkins fired officer Hector Rosado after he used the N-word — a derogatory term for African-Americans — on his personal Twitter account while off-duty. An arbitrator decided Rosado’s use of the term was not prejudiced and suggested a 10-day suspension, but Hawkins fired him.
Another great Olympic-sized 50-meter pool, although it is short course most of the time. Good flags for backstroke! And well-designed gutters. This spot also has an eight-lane warm-up pool separate from the racing pool. This is a community that takes its swimming seriously. Can't beat the price. Showers and bathrooms? Serviceable. Soviet-era concrete aesthetic. Lots of easy parking.

Wendell Maxey: Much like the Blazers themselves, the line with Greg is continuously, "wait until next year." Come to think of it that really depends if the big fella is in Portland next season. Imagine Oden getting a second start elsewhere in the league, actually staying healthy for a season, and putting up a double-double anchoring the middle. Scary thought. It's almost as frightening as Portland bringing him back and watching Oden endure yet more rehab, or worse yet, sustain another injury. Keeping Greg Oden: that's a tough decision for any GM to make, let alone for a team without a permanent GM.

Front Range fans certainly hope the Buffs and Rams make some noise in their first trips to the NCAA Tournament since 2003. But being seeded No. 11 is never a harbinger for a long run.

I guess hard times require hard-core escapism. The opening of “The Best One Yet (The Boy)” sums up the Black Eyed Peas’ appeal, in a nutshell: “Right now is the right time for the good things in life, let’s celebrate/Let’s bring upon the better times and let the sadder time dissipate.”
Dohner, meanwhile, used a network he claimed had 1,000 to 2,000 people in the U.S. and abroad to help drive up the volume and price of the shares. The inflated stock was sold before it collapsed, leaving outside investors with shares worth a few pennies each, prosecutors said.

One reason is something unionizing adjuncts won't change. I calculate that AU takes in at least $25,000 in tuition for my course -- after a heavy discount for student aid. AU pays a teacher like me $4,000 to $5,000 for it -- way more than the $2,500 national average. Most other costs are fixed. Adjuncts contribute a lot to the school's bottom line. Even a whopping salary increase wouldn't change that.

Maybe the NBA should just have the Lakers, Mavericks and Thunder meet the Blazers, Grizzlies and Nuggets at a neutral site for the first round and draw straws. I fear, however, that the Grizzlies would send center Hamed Haddadi as its representative. Maybe not. He's probably resting, too. I mean, Haddadi entered Tuesday's game averaging 4.7 minutes per contest, and Hollins played the guy 20 minutes against the Blazers.
