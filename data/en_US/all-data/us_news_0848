Donna Crawford statement in court:
Gore Vidal's 1982 senatorial campaign existed at a level of thoughtfulness now as dodo-dead as it was leagues beyond the expected campaign yuck and yack. His was one of those gaudily effervescent liberal crusades, reminiscent of Adlai Stevenson's runs for the presidency, Gene McCarthy's 1968 "flower-power" presidential campaign and indeed his own unsuccessful 1960 run for Congress from Dutchess County, N.Y. In that race, the titular head of the campaign was his friend and mentor, Eleanor Roosevelt. It was Mrs. R. who instilled in Gore the upper-crusty, good-government notion that "one speaks to the people to educate them."

Although it may be hard to imagine, is it possible that a politician may choose to do what is right regardless of the political consequences? Whatever may be said about him, President Obama is not stupid. He was warned of the consequences before this policy was made public and knew what was to follow.

The canal network has been in place for 2,000 years, with residents continually keeping up the system, said Giovanni Fontana-Antonelli, a local UNESCO official.

The fact that this never occurs ought to be a clue: This is not serious legislation but rather a piece of political theater that would achieve nothing more than puffing up the councilman's reputation among the anti-immigrant crowd. It amounts to a wholly unnecessary, mean-spirited swipe at Hispanic residents that will intimidate people regardless of whether they're in the country legally or not. And it will do nothing to improve county governance or to alter the already existing federal and state guidelines requiring government documents to be written in additional languages.

#4 TOKYO IS OPENING UP -- BIG TIME. If you get there and start to feel like you're back in Brooklyn, or San Francisco or London or Cape Town, it's not just you. It's Tokyo, too.

LB Keith Bulluck. Mr. Monday Night struck again. “You know what, I totally forgot it was Monday night,” he said. Must have been all the traveling that threw him off. Anyway, on his interception, he did a great job of dropping into the flat as soon as he recognized pass. For some reason, I decided to key on him while watching that play live. As soon as I saw his excellent pass drop and the fact he was looking at Tarvaris Jackson, who was looking for WR Sidney Rice the whole time, it was obvious what was coming. “That was my zone,” Bulluck said. “From the snap of the ball my initial look was out to No. 1 to see what was happening. I saw him breaking down to run a comeback route, so I just ran under it. This defense isn’t too different from the one I’ve been in for years. So that’s a play I’ve made before.”

It could be argued from hindsight that a far-sighted city government might well have anticipated these kinds of growth spurts that require relocation. One strategy could have been to make sure there is an "industrial reserve" of land dedicated to highly desirable industries. It could have been accomplished through zoning laws.

"I am going to have to support some element of what is being put on the table," said Assembly Speaker Sheila Y. Oliver (D-Essex), who was briefed on the proposal Thursday. But "to have unemployed people, quote, ‘share the burden’ of dealing with our fiscal (problem), it’s like adding insult to injury to devastated New Jerseyans."

The long-time face of Northfield Park, where he was the track handicapper and part-time publicist, holding court trackside most nights, Gisser is debuting a new race selections column with the U.S. Trotting Association. The "Smoking with the Giss" column is now appearing on the ustrotting.com Web site.
Buhawe has no right to benefits under the Defense Base Act because she and Salazar were not married. Their son, John Mark, now 4, is eligible for a one-time payment of about $14,000, based on his father's wages. But Buhawe was unaware that civilians employed in the war zone were covered by insurance and never filed a claim.
I couldn't find the term "gris de gris" in any of my wine books, but I did come across references to "vin gris," which is French for gray wine. Thank goodness, these wines aren't really gray. Instead, they are pale rosés made through a process known as saignée. In this method, red grapes are pressed, and a certain amount of juice is immediately "bled" out of the tank or vat to make the rosé.
She said she has eliminated the breadbasket from the table except for the occasional piece of multigrain.

Corey Mehaffy, president of the Moberly Area Economic Development Corp., told the committee Tuesday that the emails were not brought to the city's attention until this month.
I think back to my own college days. I went to a couple of private universities--Stanford and Columbia--but I did have a little help along the way. My dad, who died when I was 4, fortunately left me an insurance policy that just paid the cost of tuition at Stanford. I got through graduate school at Columbia with the aid of the GI Bill of Rights.
There's no sense fighting car culture, so you may as well embrace the boulevard. It carries the Valley's commercial lifeblood, and without it, the stars from up the hill would have no place to take their dry cleaning or get their poodles permed. Start at its southeast end in Studio City, perhaps with breakfast at Jerry’s Famous Deli (12655 Ventura Blvd., Studio City; www.jerryfamousdeli.com) and head toward Tarzana, an upscale hillside community that began with the arrival in 1919 of Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs. Check out the big digits at Hand Car Wash (11514 Ventura Blvd., Studio City; www.studiocityhandcarwash.com); the spate of sushi restaurants between Vineland Avenue and Laurel Canyon Boulevard; the 24-hour Du-par's coffee shop (12036 Ventura Blvd., Studio City; www.du-pars.com); the 24-hour Twain's coffee shop (12905 Ventura Blvd., Studio City). Or skip the foregoing and start with lunch at Sweet Butter Kitchen, Café & Market (13824 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks; www.sweetbutterkitchen.com), then check out the highly walkable stretches near Vantage, Whitsett and Cedros avenues; and the fountain at the Sherman Oaks Galleria (15301 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks; www.shermanoaksgalleria.com). The Galleria has been so thoroughly updated that it looks nothing like it did in the early '80s, when Frank and Moon Unit Zappa drew inspiration for their song "Valley Girl," but it has Arclight Cinemas, a gym, a spa and a bevy of national-chain restaurants and snack stops. You'll also pass Van Nuys Boulevard, which was a big-time teen cruising scene in the '60s and '70s before police put a stop to it. (Classic-car enthusiasts have been trying to revive summer cruising nights on the second Wednesday of every month.) To top off the journey, tip your cap at the humble offices of Edgar Rice Burroughs Inc. (18354 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana). It was here, under a walnut tree, that the author's family scattered his ashes in 1950. (A Burroughs office staffer notes, "We have had a lot of landscaping done in the meantime.")
"Everyone loves seasonals and can't wait to get them," says John Najeway, owner of the Akron brewery. "It looks like another great year for seasonals."
On Friday, Burroughs' character will hit the big screen in "John Carter," the first live-action film from director Andrew Stanton, the Pixar wizard who won an Oscar for "WALL-E." The new film stars Taylor Kitsch in the title role as a Civil War soldier who mysteriously wanders into a time warp and finds himself on Mars with super-powers caused by the change in gravity. He lands in the middle of another civil war on a dying planet, where he chooses sides with a beautiful warrior princess, played by Lynn Collins.
Virginia and Ohio are expected to be key swing states in next year's presidential election.
Knopp says he decided to take on Telfer because he saw too little action by the Legislature to boost jobs. He cites missed opportunities to eliminate estate taxes, to withdraw more water from the Columbia River for farmers and to lower income taxes on low- and middle-income earners.

Parent Kim Gonzales said Parks' courses and programs remind her in many ways of a high school. At the same time, the school keeps its middle school identity by continuing to nurture the young adolescents, Gonzales said.
‘HUGE SUBSIDY’
The smell of fresh-baked croissants, combined with the enticing window displays featuring all manner of luscious-looking treats, rendered us helpless. Over the course of a few days, we consumed a muffin made with pistachio and cherries; a croissant aux amandes topped with crystallized sugar and smoky-flavored toasted almonds; and a tarte Tatin, whose crunchy pastry with honey, butter and caramelized sugar overtones left me speechless.
Even with Kidd's uncanny performance, the game wasn't decided until the fourth quarter, when Dallas went to the free throw line 19 times, making 18, while Portland attempted two free throws, making one.

A cabaret show - "Ben, Ron & Jack: Together Again for the First Time" - starred Stages executive producer Jack Lane, managing director Ron Gibbs and one of its favorite performers, Ben Nordstrom. (He plays a dancing gangster in its current mainstage production, "The Drowsy Chaperone," and directed its current family show, "Alice in Wonderland.") All three guys have plenty of stage experience - though Lane pointed out that his isn't especially recent! But he did a fine job with a selection of ballads, and Gibbs proved himself still quite the dancer. And Nordstrom? Nordstrom - singing falsetto and doing splits and flirting with women in the front row (while his pretty wife, Kristen, laughed near the back of the house) - was absolutely shameless.
One of those attending the center's twice-a-week aerobics class is Vincent Sciamone, 83. He moved to Lakeville to live with his daughter after his wife died more than a year ago. After having a bite at the center last week, Sciamone said he likes the recently added current-events group that meets monthly to hear and discuss lectures. Sciamone also joined the Single Seniors club, and spoke excitedly about a recent day trip to the National Eagle Center in Wabasha.
Season 2 will run 10 episodes, the same as Season 1, Lombardo said. Doing more would mean either "diluting the quality" or making viewers wait more than a year for new episodes.
"The global economy will pay the price for sanctioning Iran's oil," Seyed Shamsedin Hosseini, Iran's finance minister and the government's spokesperson for economy, said on Tuesday. "The consequences of this embargo will disrupt the oil market, not Iran. We can always find other buyers."
Which means we need a drill; we need to sound the alarms! We need to rise up and be the voices for our special needs communities. We need to demand accountability from our schools, our districts, our states and our federal government. We need to be the voice for the voiceless, because if they could, I’m sure they’d have plenty to say. Just look into the eyes of those who have been mercilessly abused at the hands of someone they once trusted and you can SEE and HEAR and FEEL just a tiny fraction of the pain and suffering they have endured.

It started as an occasional movie under the stars in Tower Grove Park, but now, the civic-minded folks at Frontyard Features present hundreds of free outdoor screenings in urban neighborhoods and small towns throughout Missouri and Illinois, from late spring through Indian Summer. The movies, both old and new, are often pegged to the particular community that sponsors the event; so you might see "Meet Me In St. Louis" near Forest Park, "The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery" near the Southwest Bank where Steve McQueen re-enacted the true story or "Weird Science" near the Planetarium. The idea is to bring neighbors together for a free evening of

“That’s just the way it is,'' Van Gundy said. "Again, I’ve been dealing with that all year. It’s not anything real bothersome. You go out and do your job.”
For one former player, McInerney's arrest brought back experiences he'd just as soon forget. The player, now an adult, spoke to authorities after McInerney was charged in November. His statements form the basis for one of the nine counts filed against McInerney last month.
Stan Musial was a poor boy from a Pittsburgh suburb called Donora, best known for producing a murderer's row of hitters — Ken Griffey Sr. and Jr. also were born there — and for a killer smog in 1948 caused by smoke trapped by an inversion layer that claimed dozens of lives. (And you thought L.A.'s air wasn;t fresh.) Using a unique batting stance that twisted his torso into a question mark, Musial got two hits in his first game, two in his last. He was so consistent, he got 1,815 hits on the road, 1,815 at home. He weighed 170 pounds, yet once walloped five home runs on the same day in a doubleheader. He struck out 696 times. (Reggie Jackson's total was 2,597.) What a man the Man was.

NOTES: Chicago's Tom Thibodeau didn't have much reaction to finishing second in the NBA Coach of the Year voting. However, he did have plenty of praise for the winner, San Antonio's Gregg Popovich. "The thing about Pop is he's a great example for our profession," Thibodeau said before the game. "I'm happy for him that he's had a great season." Popovich received 77 first-place votes, while Thibodeau got 27. Thibodeau could have become the first coach in league history to win the award two years in a row. ...

The Bulls are 30-2 all-time in playoff series when they have home-court advantage, and 31-4 when they win Game 1. Last year in the Eastern Conference finals, they had the home-court edge and won Game 1 vs. Miami, then lost the series in five games.

That is what happened to Goerne. He simply vanished. He changed, before our eyes and ears, from beefy baritone to a ghost. He sang the cycle's 20 songs not to beguile us with Schubert's incomparable lyricism, but to unnerve us with their poetic sentiment. After nearly 80 minutes, he left the audience in a moment of stunned silence.

“No, I think if you look at it in stages, his preseason was okay. The start of the season, exactly where he fit, was another question. And then I think he just got an opportunity to play, got a taste of it, he knew he had a lot to learn, but was willing — and he had the ability — to put himself in positions where he could take full advantage of that. And then it just started to grow and develop.”

Commercials are the latest arena in which TV and movie stars are crowding out voice-over professionals. Most major documentaries use big-screen or TV talent -- think Morgan Freeman in the hit film "March of the Penguins." Big parts in animated movies go almost exclusively to recognizable actors -- Tom Hanks in "Toy Story" or Mike Myers in "Shrek" -- in part because the stars can market the movie in ways an unknown can't.

I and my siblings learned the hard way. It was the last holiday that we were kowtowed by our father's wounds. From then on, we invited them both to everything and let the cards fall where they may. And guess what? He kept attending things! He wasn't happy, but he didn't want to miss out. (What we couldn't see earlier was how much of his rhetoric was bluster and power play.)

The cost to athletes and their organizations is enormous, at times debilitating. And good luck finding a retired athlete who doesn't suffer from hip, knee or foot ailments. Further, recent studies continue to substantiate what common sense has long suggested  that concussions are particularly problematic.

All along, Brown has argued for the taxes that were increased as part of the 2009 budget deal to be extended for five years. But if they expire as they are set to do Friday - and if he gets the election he wants - he will have to persuade voters to raise taxes instead of extend taxes.
His win in New York was by only a neck over a hard-charging Alpha, but he rallied after being caught, a sign of a strong and competitive horse. Gemologist also didn't appear to be extended.
Eyewitness accounts in such places as the tribal areas must be regarded with great skepticism; playing up alleged U.S. atrocities is a common recruiting strategy for terrorist groups. But claims of secondary drone strikes are so frequent that they call for further investigation. Meanwhile, Washington Post reporter Joby Warrick, in his recent book, "The Triple Agent," describes a 2009 drone attack at the funeral of a Taliban operative that was aimed at a senior commander; he escaped, but dozens of civilians, including children, were reportedly killed in the strike. Are funerals appropriate targets, even when they provide an opportunity to lure dangerous terrorists out of hiding?

Mr. Obama's Afghan withdrawal plan is unraveling, his efforts to reset relations with Russia so far have been a total failure, his dismantling of our nuclear weapons capability is foolish, and he sold our European allies out to Russia by canceling a Bush-era plan to establish anti-missile defenses in Poland and the Czech Republic.

High gas prices continued to fuel small car sales, as they have done all year. But prices appear to have peaked and have fallen 12 cents a gallon in the past month to $3.81. That helped boost truck sales last month, which will mean higher profits for companies. Full-size pickups rose to 10 percent of the market from 8 percent last year, Ford U.S. sales analyst Erich Merkle said.

And the field position, too. On the game's first drive, the Bulldogs decided to go for it on fourth-and-inches from their own 35-yard line. Lemasters was stopped short of the first down by West sophomore defensive lineman Ryan Rockow (6-2, 230). After that, the Warriors started many drives in Bulldogs' territory or near midfield.

I've been doing this league for 20 years. I've watched this transistion. It used to be such an emphasis on the running game and defense. It's become more and more all about the quaorterbacks.

1. Market share. There are many things that make Baltimore a bit different from the others. One of the most striking examples: the city's thriving neighborhood market halls, a throwback to a time before gigantic suburban supermarkets. Locals pack into Nick's Oyster Bar at the Cross Street Market, a focal point for the dynamic Federal Hill neighborhood; crab cakes at Faidley's — where muskrat and raccoon, both local delicacies, are still sold — remain a must at downtown's Lexington Market, which has been going strong on this very same spot since the 1700s. These days, there's a good bit of buzz on the newly-refurbished Belvedere Market, a small but vibrant part of the Belvedere Square shopping district on the city's north side. Here, it's all about local and artisanal; stop in for a slice of cheesecake or a hearty meat pie at Atwater's.

Calcium — It is necessary for healthy bone development. Inadequate calcium intake during childhood can affect current growth and might contribute to the development of weakened and porous bones later in life. Low-fat milk, cheese, yogurt and sardines are excellent sources of calcium. Some vegetables, such as broccoli and spinach, also contain modest amounts of calcium. Some fruit juices are now fortified and provide a good source of calcium. 

Band hazing case
It should be an interesting season in the American League, with the Yankees supposedly upgrading their pitching and the Red Sox doing virtually nothing. The clear winners in the offseason were the Detroit Tigers and the Angels. With the Tigers and Angels signing Prince Fielder and Albert Pujols, their offenses just got a lot stronger. But the Tigers will have defensive problems and the Angels could have pitching problems, even with signing C.J. Wilson. Both are still strong enough to easily win their divisions.

Chamberlain burst onto the scene memorably in 2007, entering games for Joe Torre with some of the most electric stuff Yankees fans had ever seen. Mid-90s fastball. Undetectable slider. Back then, general manager Brian Cashman used to talk about protecting Chamberlain’s arm by limiting his innings, the so-called “Joba Rules.” This was part of the plan for Chamberlain to become a front of the rotation starter. Those plans are history now. When you mention Chamberlain now, it’s all about the bullpen. If this is indeed the final season for Rivera, it’s not out of the question to think Chamberlain could be the man to replace him as the Yankees closer. It all depends on how he responds.

LOS ANGELES — For generations of women, it's been an ingrained medical ritual: Get a Pap test every year. Now two influential groups of medical experts say that having cervical cancer screening once a year is not necessary and, in fact, should be discouraged.
"Femme Fatale," Spears' latest album, is poised to make its debut tomorrow atop the Billboard charts. It will be Spears' sixth chart-topping set in seven tries. "Till the World Ends," co-written by Ke$ha, is the newest single by Spears, and it looks destined to reach the top of the charts, too -- maybe not this week, but it'll be there soon enough. Like much of "Femme Fatale," "Till the World Ends" is an upbeat, slightly frosty club track with heavily processed vocals. This kickoff cut sets the tone for the rest of the ballad-free album: it's a late-night cruise through abandoned city streets in a top-dollar precision automobile. The windows are tinted (of course) and the driver might just be a little lost. But she's not taking her foot off of the accelerator.

The first "parent trigger" petition in California, which sought to allow a charter organization to take over a Compton elementary school, ultimately failed amid bitter charges on both sides that parents had been harassed and lied to. The state Board of Education had a chance to make the process less chaotic by requiring open meetings at which both reformers and opponents would lay out their arguments, enabling parents to make an informed decision. But the board adopted regulations that fell short, so no one should be surprised that the state's second trigger petition, this time in Adelanto, resulted in similar confusion and rancor.

Whether tearful or defiant, Copts said they worried that the loss of 88-year-old Shenouda, who died Saturday after a long illness, leaves space for extremists to widen a devastating sectarian campaign that's persisted for years but worsened since the revolt that unseated President Hosni Mubarak a year ago.
These program changes again illustrate the fundamental way in which frequent flyer programs have changed in recent years. Yes, they're still "loyalty" programs, but the loyalty element now focuses on elite status. The miles you get matter, but the only miles that really matter are those you earn by flying -- the ones that determine your elite status. The primary loyalty rewards are no longer "free" trips you buy with miles, they're upgrades, access to economy plus, and waived baggage fees. Moreover, the new schedules make it clear that access to rewards will depend on your elite level. The focus is fully on coddling the very best customers -- certainly an understandable policy. But upgrades and award seats are definitely a zero-sum game: The better it gets for elites, the worse it gets for ordinary travelers.

It's the ninth year for the festival. What goes into deciding what acts will be brought in as headliners? The buck stops here. Every year I look at who's out there and has not been here.

In a signature swipe at the nation's growing income gap, Obama called for a new minimum tax rate of at least 30 percent on anyone making over $1 million.

For as long as I can remember, my grandmother has cooked for every family gathering. My fondest holiday memories involve her standing at her kitchen stove.

Suspect signatures on the paperwork include 290 signed by Bryan Bly and 155 by Crystal Moore. In the mortgage investigations last fall, both admitted signing their names to mortgage documents without having read them. Neither was charged with a crime.
Now, Biel said, people look at the Titanic sinking and other man-made disasters as technological hubris, the misbegotten belief that something could be too good to fail. The space shuttles were portrayed as such until Challenger exploded in 1986.

Ask yourself this question: If the proposed library is so good for Gladstone, why don't they want us to vote on it? They would be making all their impassioned pleas if we were actually voting on the library. We are voting on the right to vote. The City Council should have put it on the ballot and let the supporters garner enough votes for it to pass and get built. If 3-394 and 3-395 pass, they should do exactly that. What is so wrong with allowing the taxpayers to vote?

"The Netherlands Lives With Water" is one of 11 stories in Shepard's new collection, "You Think That's Bad," and it's a stunner: a look at a future Holland in which climate change has created a flood crisis so extreme that it's no longer certain how or whether the country will survive. "It's the catastrophe for which the Dutch have been planning for fifty years," Shepard tells us. "Or, really, for as long as we've existed. We had cooperative water management before we had a state." What such a story really traces, however, is the point at which cooperation, management, all the tools of civilization may no longer be enough.
"Sometimes when you are in certain areas that don't have a lot of black young men around, people might watch you a little more and it can be uncomfortable," he said. "It makes me feel like I don't belong there. Not necessarily scared, but it makes me feel out of place."

"I can't imagine there's enough wiggle room to make any substantial change in the unemployment rate, but it's symbolic," Healy said. Still, he added, "it's not the way the system is supposed to work. Congress is supposed to make the laws, with the participation of the president."

"Schools that are using AP in a very deliberate way to change the culture, there's something very powerful there," said Senior Vice President Trevor Packer.

Hey, Paul: On a serious note, I understand the fans' passion is so feverish that they care about uniform style and color. I get that. When I first started answering uniform questions, I heard from so many people that disagreed with my opinions, or my answers, that it became a waste of time to field them anymore. When I'd point out the all-white look was the traditional style preferred by Paul Brown, they would quibble with the width of the stripes, the color of the facemask, etc. Thus, my moratorium on all uniform questions, with very few exceptions.

Protesters and police at first interacted in good humor Saturday as they negotiated taking down the big blue "Tent of Dreams," which protesters had unfurled over a Civil War statue Monday. But relations grew tense as the day wore on and police began clearing the park of several truckloads of bedding and trash.

"Young Adult Friction," a typically fetching track from the first album, is about every bookish college kid's most persistent fantasy: sex in the library stacks. This gives Berman the opportunity to use "microfiche" in a rhyme, and to make a silly pun about "checking me out" with a straight face. (The video honors long-standing Belle and Sebastian tradition: synth player Peggy Wang reads a book as she plays.) Later on the set, Berman sings about a liaison with a professor. Sounds like he had more fun in college than I did.

We may not be in danger of running out of water, but the problem is the uneven distribution and availability of clean water. For example, India, with 17 percent of the world's population, has only 4 percent of the usable fresh water. Coupled with rapid economic growth and urbanization, the demand-supply gap is widening. Among countries facing increased scarcity, Bangladesh, already suffering a shortage of nearly 40 percent during the dry season, is a prime example. Its surface and groundwaters are contaminated and its rivers are dying because of industrial and human waste, causing a number of diseases.
Bloomberg weathered criticism after a Dec. 26 storm dumped nearly two feet of snow that seemed to catch officials by surprise.
