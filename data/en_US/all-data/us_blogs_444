In an effort to provide the missing answer, on April 24, the Center for Security Policy is making available via the Internet a new, free ten-part video course called “The Muslim Brotherhood in America: The Enemy Within.” This course connects the proverbial dots, drawing on a wealth of publicly available data and first-hand accounts to present a picture that has, for over a decade, been obscured, denied and suppressed:

Please don’t get me wrong. I understand that cancer is hard and that it is a struggle to deal with all of the consequences and treatment is often harder than the disease and believe me, NO ONE wants to be well more than I do. But that is a whole lot of pressure to put on me. I will not quit. I will not stop. I will not give up. But with all the other stuff that I am going to have to do, don’t ask me to fight, too. You fight. You fight for me. You get down on our knees when I don’t have the strength. You pick up my babies when I can’t climb the stairs to tuck them in at night. You feed my family when I am too broken or too sick or too tired to do it. You fight for me.
Although I've never been inclined to add condiments to my food, I made this mayo with the intention of eating it with the black bean burgers, as well as for the sake of being open to trying previously-disliked food items. I turns out that the burgers didn't really benefit from the addition of the mayo, which boasted little flavor. That may be dependent on the amount of flavor in the avocado itself. In any case, I ended up adding more seasoning, primarily in the form of additional hot sauce, just to get myself to accept the use of this mayo as a condiment.

As a child, whenever I felt a storm of sorrow moving in, I strung intricate beaded necklaces, or scribbled in my sketch book, or played some music on a little record player in my room. And I read the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen. The main characters lived happily ever after, and I believed that someday I could be happy too. If a plain brown nightingale could bring joy to an emperor by its singing, I could also bring inspiration and joy to someone.
The research comes from the Highway Loss Data Institute, a firm run by insurance companies to find ways of reducing crashes and deaths. Using five years’ worth of insurance claims from 2005 to 2010, the HLDI compared the collision rates between adults drivers between 35 and 60 years old and teen drivers between the ages of 16 and 19.

Cosmopolis has released a first full trailer on the same day it was announced as part of the Cannes film festival. Directed by David Cronenberg, Robert Pattinson stars as Eric Packer, a young billionaire who discovers he’s lost his entire fortune whilst on a limo journey across New York. The movie is adapted from the novel by Don DeLillo and featuring support from the likes of Paul Giamatti, Juliette Binoche, Samantha Morton and Jay Baruchel.
As you travel further into Little Wildhorse from the north the canyon gets narrower and narrower and becomes an incredible slot canyon. There is a reason for this canyon’s popularity. It is easy to get to, it is non technical and mostly flat, and it is a classic slot. We were pretty stoked that we only came across a small handful of people on the entire trip back down.

Reds (especially reclaimed reds from window glass) can act really strange when fired in a kiln... but this red did not. In fact, we thought the red was even more attractive after firing. So we decided to create a bracelet that did not match but would coordinate well with the Glass Charm Necklace.
Yet whatever we’ll hear at Kilkenny or on forthcoming releases is bound to be intrinsically connected to their homeland – intricately romantic, rapturous, dreamy, dramatic and not a little bit unusual.

It is difficult to market a self-published book, I have learned this during the past few months. You have to really push yourself and to an extent, boast about your achievements, which I personally find hard to do. Making announcements is something one has to do as second nature; selling yourself becomes a way of life. I have thought about contacting a PR consultant but up to now, I’ve persevered by myself.

The elementary school does a Lip Sync Competition for the 4th and 5th graders in March. It gives a chance for the kids to be creative and express themselves on stage. Annika and her friends performed a Selena Gomez song. She and her two best friends worked on the routine since January. The other moms and I chose to take a back seat on this and let the girls drive it. It was only in the last few weeks that we began to panic and tried to arrange more practices and help with their costumes (one mom bought chain necklaces and I made headbands). During the show, we were quite surprised to see the quality of the acts. Some where like ours (earnest effort by kids), while others had been choreographed, well-staged, and coordinated costumes. Next year, we all told ourselves.

As I may have mentioned in previous posts, my father had a lot of anxiety through out his life and our childhood. At least that’s how I see it now. As a child, we feared him. He was an unreasonable ogre who required constant busyness from us. Living in the country, there was no lack of work to be done or created to keep us occupied. It seemed he could not tolerate idle children nor could he stand the sound of children laughing or playing. Even the stillness of homework or reading was a cue to him that a chore needed to be assigned. He didn’t dwell much on good grades but he did emphasis the importance of a clean house, manicured grounds and freshly chopped and stacked firewood.

The Planning Commission’s September 27, 2006 letter has no direct references to superblocking. There is potentially an oblique one: The letter mentions in passing that the Design Guidelines for the open space “require generous entrances to the open space along Atlantic Avenue that are aligned with the street grid to the north, to emphasize connections between Fort Green and Prospect Heights, and will contain ample seating and planting to promote their use.” The reference to how seating and planting might promote the connection of the neighborhoods is what is offered in lieu of actual streets.

All over this article there are tales of harassment, death threats, home vandalism, even rape by a boyfriend Kiki met online. I teared up reading some of the stories. Throughout it all, Kiki’s parents looked on, helplessly. They saw the hate mail: “I know where you live and I’m gonna kill your fucking cat.” They saw the death threats: “I’ll fucking murder you little girl.” They allowed her boyfriend to stay in their home, despite his strange actions as his relationship with their daughter progressed because they “couldn’t figure out how to kick him out.” They watched their daughter dwindle to 72 pounds, and through it all, they never stepped in, they never took her off the internet.

Yes – but not much. I’m quite squeamish about discussing it, because I’m still at the first draft stage, and things are still developing. So, I hope it doesn’t sound too mealy-mouthed to give you the briefest of brief pitches (an elevator pitch, if the elevator was going up one floor, for a very lazy passenger): the next novel is about a very ordinary woman who has a midlife crisis, and does something absolutely extraordinary in response to it.

“There’s an element when you’re interviewing somebody that you have to present the version of yourself to them that you think they will respond to. Which is really bad if you talk to somebody for so long that you start falling into their cadences of speech. One of the many things you do when you’re interviewing someone is that you’re constantly monitoring their responses, thinking Can I push them further? I need to get a quote from them on this subject. It’s incredibly difficult nowadays when you’re interviewing celebrities and there’s a PR handler and they’re aware they want to give you the blandest interview possible but they want to get a huge plug for the film.

First you cook the chicken and put it off to the side... (I wipe out the pan and start again with the oil!) I put all the veggies except the cabbage in the wok and continue to stir it until they become tender (NOT mushy) then I add the cabbage as it wilts pretty fast... I throw in the cooked chicken... and then I add some soy sauce (also depends on the amount of veggies I have!) Stir that around a bit then move the veggies to the outside edge of the wok and add some cornstarch mixed with water to the boiling liquid in the center to thicken the sauce a bit.
The final point I need to make is that the challenge of leaning innovation within a large organization is a unique one. There is a wonderful quote attributed to Stephen King that goes : “Artistic talent is far more common than the talent to nurture artistic talent. Any parent with a hard hand can crush it, but to nurture it is much more difficult.“
A good couple of books to start this post are two Damon Runyon collections. As I wrote previously, Runyon was “best known for his short stories celebrating the world of Broadway in New York City that grew out of the Prohibition era. To New Yorkers of his generation, a "Damon Runyon character" evoked a distinctive social type from the Brooklyn or Midtown demi-monde.”

And mutually exclusive they are. But the claim that experience is the only thing we know, or the claim that there are no values in the physical world studied by science and that therefore they must come from somewhere else, are metaphysical and epistemological claims. All philosophy is about metaphysics and epistemology, as unfashionable as it may be to say so these days. And Hume (about whom I will have a good deal more to say in Chapter Three) points out the curious fact that no amount of discussion of physical experience produces any account of programmatic duty, while Kant is moved by his sense of the amorality of the physical world to make the radical claim that the phenomenal world is not, could not be, all that there is. The penultimate difference between Hume and Kant is a difference about the nature of the human mind; like all of the best philosophers their views on both ethics and psychology are systematically motivated by more central positions on epistemology and metaphysics. So if there is a persuasive argument that mind is a heterogeneous concept that argument will extend to the claim that ethics is a heterogeneous concept.

Summary: Recent events, such as the Greek election and the speeches of GOP congressmen, suggest it was premature to declare the “end of history”. As the post-WWII era ends, each day brings forth new developments from the basement of humanity’s collective mind and soul. We must wait to judge, but such political developments suggest that so far what’s emerged are monsters.

In other news, I am now way behind on Devil in the White City and am going to have to do a lot of catching up before Sunday. It's beautifully written, but the serial killer freaks me all the way out. I know he's been dead for a long time, but still: MAJOR CREEPY. So far on the architecture side it's mostly been meetings, which while important are not particularly riveting.

I kneaded the dough again and set it aside to proof a second time and settled down with a big pot of tea to study. An hour later, the dough was in the oven and sending a gorgeous smell throughout the house. It was time to shepherd the chickens back into their coop. I was sure they would put themselves away by dark to roost, but I didn’t want to risk the fact that they wouldn’t, and Id be chasing chooks in the cold and dark! Chickadee came quietly, a quick pounce and I carried her in. Delorus had to be herded like a sheep, with me running behind her like a lanky eedjit. Fortunately she went looking for ChickadeeTommy for safety in the coop, and despite looking ridiculous, it was fairly painless. Before I went back in for the night, I laid waste to a large overgrown rosemary in the backyard and hung bushels of rosemary around the kitchen to dry for my next recipe!

Many tend to make a couple of bad mistakes upon realizing they need to cut down or completely eliminate sugar and high fructose corn syrup from their diet. The first is to use artificial sweeteners such as aspartame and Splenda (sucralose).

After a couple of days though, I packed up my backpack and started my move down the Pacific Coast. I came across a small town called Playa Flamingo, the sand was brown and the beach not all that exciting given there were fishing boats about. What was wonderful though, was that you could walk in either direction north or south and find more beaches. Playa Conchal was likely one of the most beautiful I found in Costa Rica, and definitely the most unique. Rather than sand, it was made up of crushed sea shells that had been made so incredibly smooth by the passing tide, you wouldn’t believe it. Every shell reflecting the sun like no sand ever could. Excuse my poor quality pictures, this was three cameras back for me, and I wish I had invested in something better before going.

The play is about two sets of next door neighbours and some news that’s about to rock both families, but not necessarily in a way you would expect. Good comedy has to be laced with a heavy tinge of sadness and tragedy in order to give it weight and Pauline McLynn succeeded in this endeavour by giving her character the sadness and depth that propelled the comedic moments, right down to her very poignant final line. Deirdre O’Kane delivered her lines in her fabulously effortless style. She is naturally funny and convincing. You really do believe in the friendship between the two women, as you do in the friendship of the hubbies: Lorcan Cranitch’s lovable character, who just wants to keep the missus happy and the sometimes suited friend, played very well by Declan Conlon. The differences between the two characters were superbly drawn, but they had a credible friendship, which served to make the twists and turns more palpable, when Conlon’s seeming affability is called into question.

“Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’” – Matthew 6:25-33

So I was worrying about this necklace, agonizing over how I was going to force myself to work on it. I had been making all sorts of promises (and threats) to myself - just do an inch, come on now - just an inch a day! But I just couldn't. And since I had vowed not to start anything else, I have had the most unproductive 8 days of my beading life - I have gotten nothing done, creatively. I have balanced the books, vacuumed, dusted, cleaned the bathroom, played on the computer (Pinterest, I'm looking at you!) - but no jewelry design! I even had to tackle a huge pile of do-over jewelry (repairs) one day last week, and I actually got up and moved to a whole other table, with a brand spanking clean bead mat, bringing all my tools with me, since there was no room on my own workbench! Sad.
Now believe me, it would be a piece of cake for me from here on to just sit back on the regular daily 12-18,000 hits The Slog gets, keep on observing the blindingly obvious, take lots of ads on the site, and sell books to the readers called things like The Wit & Wisdom of The Slog. (All of which I may well do, because I need to amortise some costs here).
I got a text from my hubby yesterday telling me his parents have invited us to Easter lunch at one of their places they like to eat (they don't eat at home...ever) and I was shocked because we've never done another holiday before.

Even though I have boys, much of what Kessler wrote about her middle schooler daughter applies to my son of the same age. The book's premise is shocking at first- Kessler shadows her daughter (with permission, but still...) at school, online, in the wrestling ring and on the athletic field. It sounds horrifying! Like she's one of those overparenting, helicopter "smothers" who lack boundaries and is completely controlling. Only Kessler pulls it off for the most part.

Right now there is a gold rush going on in terms of digital content. A lot of writers who have no business letting their work see the light of day are publishing willy-nilly, hoping to cash in. This does not dismay me: far from it. Those readers who have read terrible self-published hack-work have a greater appreciation for self-published work of a professional standard. I try very hard to only present the best work I'm capable of, and take pains to make sure it's as error-free as I can make it. And when I do catch an error and dread the thought of having to re-upload a corrected copy, I remind myself how infuriating it is that my ebook published by Random House - one of the largest publishers in the world - doesn't even get my name right. They mis-capitalized it. The lesson: Only you can make sure it's done the way you want it.

repointing the mortar on the privy, and will soon move on to the main house. Repointing is the process by which we replace failing mortar with new historically accurate mortar. This protects the historic bricks by facilitating the flow of water away from the brick wall instead of allowing it to rest in the cavities left by crumbling mortar. Historic bricks behave like sponges; if water is allowed to rest on them for even a short period of time they will absorb it rapidly. What’s more, the water can carry harmful chemicals into the bricks, hastening their deterioration.

If you want unschooling to work the way you would "prefer" it to work, you won't be able to keep that inside for long. Your preconceived preferences will come out in the questions you ask, in the words you use, and in the way you react to what your children are doing. You will be unable to resist applying your own judgment about what they are learning and how they are learning it; and your children will understand that and, frequently adapt either what they are learning to please you or continue to do what they're doing but tell you what you want to hear. Not so good, really.

One of the orientalists said: “When the Muslims turned away from their religious teachings and became ignorant of its wisdom and its laws, and deviated towards the contradictory (manmade) laws taken from the opinions of men, there spread in them immorality of character, falsehood, hypocrisy, illwill and hatefulness increased in them. Their unity disintegrated and they became ignorant of their present and future state and became unaware of what will harm them or will benefit them. They have become contented with the life in which they eat, drink, sleep and compete not with others, in superiority.” AII this is a visible fact, which every true believer feels, and which every enthusiastic person (about his religion) palpates in every community (nation) that gives up Al-Jihad and dips itself; (1) in a luxurious life, (2) in the worshipping of wealth and (3) in the love of this world.

The models looked stunning and walked with confidence, helped in part to their gravity-defying ‘dos from Artizan, and while most of the lingerie featured was out of my budget, if it came with a washboard stomach and curves in all the right places, I’d definitely be buying! : ) The vintage dresses included a mix of short 60s shift dresses and longer numbers, like the white 70s Grecian feather dress that floated down the catwalk.

This is my first day of the new working week as we enjoyed a long weekend here in Belgium! Unfortunately the weekend started with some bad weather, it was rather chilly and it rained a lot! We had planned to work in our garden for a few days and although the weather wasn’t excellent, Jan and Anthony started planting boxwood.

In the midst of all this chaos, I had a conference to attend. Not at all what I needed, but I'd paid for it and had to go. I arranged for my sis-in-law to stay with my son while I was away. I'd not been away anywhere in years, so although the timing was not good, in a way I looked forward to the change of scenery as I was going to Cancun. Treated myself to some new clothes which I'd also not done in years. Got home from buying my clothes and my girlfriend was there as well as my sis-in-law. I excitedly showed them everything, my girlfriend loved the stuff, but my sis-in-law was annoyed. She felt I should not be spending money on myself when I owed her Mom. My sis-in-law mentioned this to my girlfriend, who in turn told me and it sure dashed my moment of excitement, made me mad, hurt and guilty and really put a dampener on my mood. I finished packing and let it go.

So I hop onto the plane half reminiscing, half anticipating. The plane started to take off, and I settled into a shallow slumber. About an hour later, a gentle tap on my shoulder woke me up, asking me if I needed anything. I looked up to find dashing ERNEST DE CASTRO’s smiling face staring down at me. As we talk, I found out that he had been a steward for quite some time and has been traveling immensely, enjoying the experience but never forgetting where he truly belongs.

Most of the time it's easy enough to just not think about it much - just go along with life, do what we can, be extremely disciplined about medicines and treatments. And persevere. And pray. Please join us in praying for our boy's continued wellness. And most of all for a cure, which still looks promising, and quite possibly could happen in his lifetime.

Don't worry, this is going somewhere. So we decided as a family to buy Lukey, I mean Zachie, his own little boat this year.

So a friend helped us score a sweet deal and here we have her.
Hundreds of such documents, many addressed to President Wilson himself, made their way to the Paris headquarters of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace at the Hotel Crillon, but most got no further than the president’s private secretary, Gilbert Close. The president read only a small fraction of them, and he acted on fewer still. The complex and contentious issues of the European settlement were foremost on his mind during his months in Paris, and relations with the major imperial powers — Britain, France, Japan—loomed larger in the scheme of U.S. interests as Wilson saw them than did the aspirations of colonized groups or weak states. Though the dispensation of territories that belonged to the defunct empires — German colonies in Africa and the Pacific, Ottoman possessions in the Arab Middle East — was an important topic in the peace negotiations, the leading peacemakers had no intention of entertaining the claims for self-determination of dependent peoples elsewhere, least of all those that ran against their own interests. To himself and to others, Wilson explained this lapse by asserting that the peace conference already had enough on its plate and that the League of Nations would take up such claims in due time.

Also, I still have to find a way to feed Finnigan until I can get his pellet. I ended up deciding to go by the homeless shelter, and offer to pick up duck chow for them as a donation since I felt bad about not volunteering this week. We took Saint with us, because he needed to be reaffirmed that he is the FAVORITE. He absolutely HATES the van, almost every ride he has made with us ended in vomit. We went a half an hour out of our way for special pellet for Finnigan. It’s because he is a Giant, he needs more protein. I have decided to call him ‘Finnigan of the ticklish tum.’ I also got a bale of hay because it would appear that everybody around here needs some roughage. No sooner had we parked than Saint lost his mid morning snack. He is just too predictable.
But I am fortunate to have quite a few friends and former colleagues who visit me.
“Ok then.” I said and pointed at her, ”You just go right back in there with that little air compressor thingy of yours, flip the switch to Suck instead of Blow and get the poots out yourself.” I pretended to wipe my hands clean. “Problem solved. TaDa.” I smiled. She didn’t.
In past years, I’ve just escalated feed in the last 30 days of pregnancy, leading up to the first day lambs are due. This time, I started ramping them up on grain ten weeks prior to lambing, bringing them up to 1.5 lbs. per head per day over three weeks. So they had seven full weeks of high grain before the onset of lambing (and more if they lambed later than the first day). I used a “dry” rolled corn-barley mix (no molasses), which is only about 10% protein, same as my hay. So, it’s not a “hot” feed like soybean meal (which is about 50% protein). Rather, it is just something to give them extra calories as they are able to take in less feed volume when their bellies are full of lambs.

I also see such occasions as opportunities to grow. Often what hits me is nothing new. It may regard something that I can’t escape. I want to grow in it, in my response to it.

Nevertheless, the US census began allowing mixed-race children to check more than one box for race in 2000. A somewhat snarky line in the New York Times article attributes this change to “years of complaints and lobbying, mostly by the white mothers of biracial children.” This ignores the contributions of adult mixed-race people such as psychology researcher Maria Root, whose work was considered by the government in their decision to change the census format.
The night arrived, and we prepared ourselves chemically for the big event. To say that our performance that night achieved "trashiness" is a gross understatement. OMG, this time we were way, way beyond trashy, although there were moments of extreme musical weirdness which somehow transcended awfulness and approached some kind of horrible genius, if I don't say so myself. "I remember being really stoned," recalled Jeff later, "and giving birth to an ET doll on the stage of the Temple of Music and Art with a strobe light going.

I was also impressed that the packaging was unique for each one. It featured a picture of the truck that was included within. Normally, they would just have a generic packaging that would be used for all of the toys in a particular promotion so this was a bit of a step up.

Blyleven, let's be honest, has been a bane to Morris supporters for years. When Morris first came on the ballot in 2000, Morris fans simply took it for granted that he was a better pitcher than Blyleven. Come on: That wasn't even worth talking about. It was no contest. Jack Morris was, well, he was JACK MORRIS, ace, warrior, Ruler of the Mound, Patron Saint of Game 7, Pitcher To The Score. And Bert Blyleven was, eh, he was Bert Blyleven. Morris popped on the ballot and got more than 22% of the vote right off the bat. Blyleven, who had been on the ballot for two years already, received fewer than 18%.

Oh wait a minute, I forgot. Georgetown covered up its cross to accommodate the President of the United States when he decided to grace them with his presence. The reason: They didn't want to offend anyone, and wanted to be "inclusive". Then why did he pick a "Catholic" institution to do his speech? Or how about Notre Dame's shameful honorary degree given to the same President, who came on T.V. and scolded America about not coming to a "common ground", when it pertains to abortion. I have heard others using these two examples of "Catholic" universities as being more flexible and reasonable when it comes to being inclusive of everyone.

It would seem that LOLA went at a little overboard while trying to withdraw a small fraction of the 3345 BTU's she was putting out there. It's at this point we meet Mr. Watson (Alfred Topes), the self-described visionary who invented LOLA, and Joanna (Jackie Wray), a freshly permed secretary who is "weary of progress." Discussing how LOLA works, the two exchange a largish slab of expository dialogue, then Mr. Watson relinquishes his post, leaving LOLA in charge.

It was cold on my flight from London to Glasgow. I know it was cold because the air-stewardess - not breathtakingly gorgeous on RyanAir, it would blow the budget - decided to use it as break the ice small talk. I have a horrible nightmare that 1ne day I'm going to be on a budget airline that gets the passengers involved in some sort of mid flight game...duck duck goose or something horrendous. The head stewardess is fierce of face, a sort of older, broken in head stewardess, ground down by routine and constant RyanAir flights hither and tither. She's terse, her tea pouring skills generally slapdash. I felt bad staring at her and waiting for outbursts. My own at work demeanour could do with a touch up probably, and I don't even make tea for Little Englanders slapping the front of their Suns and speaking proudly of their hopes for David Cameron. I said to my friend when I left Melbourne how odd it was that Virgin Blue play Kate Miller Heidkes "Last Day On Earth" just as the plane takes off in a rather disturbing juxtaposition of song title and potential disaster, but here, I'm sitting on my own, and any whimsical observation about the James Nesbitt voice over that pipes through the plane 6ix times a flight would be lost on the Little Englanders sitting next to me. The wife is a sort of Pat Butcher from Eastenders blonde bouffant headbutt (yeah! yeah!...no one gets that...) clinging old woman with a botox forehead, her husband a living breathing Jeremy Kyle visiting caricature of a man who says what he likes and likes what he says. Mid flight, she pretends to fall asleep. I know she's pretending because she keeps turning away from him and looking at me, but any time he presses her on the shoulder, her eyes clasp tight. Her husband instead engages the man in the row next to him in political debate, and she looks at me like the weariest woman in the world. I am, as it happens, no help to her. Not politically minded, and not particularly awake to offer a re-assuring glance. I read my Bill Walsh book from cover to cover and didn't even tell her she'd soon land at an airport with tartan "bunnets" painted on the toilet doors, the phrase Pure Dead Brilliant painted in a purple mantra across the walls, and some of the most incomprehensible wee men doddering about an airport you could ever hope to find...

I bought my first shoe trees just over 2 years ago, in year 3 of my 5-year project. I had long been an admirer of shoe trees, which I had often seen used in high street shops like Clarks to display their more expensive shoes. I discovered that cedar is the wood of choice because of its natural deodorising properties and its propensity for absorbing moisture. However, I had no idea where one might go to purchase shoe trees. I did some internet research and discovered that cedar shoe trees aren’t cheap, but developed a better idea of what type of shoe tree I was interested in.

With Fire with Fire, the narrative kept changing. At first I thought we were in a firefighting movie (it’s called Fire with Fire, it’s about a firefighter, and the first scene is a fire). Then it becomes a witness relocation movie. Then it becomes a revenge film. Then it turns into a gang war film. I’m not saying you can’t change directions in a script. We were just talking yesterday about doing this at the midpoint. But if you keep doing it, the reader starts becoming confused. I know I was. “What kind of movie is this exactly?” I kept asking. You really have to be a great writer to pull this off and while O’Connor is a very good writer, I would’ve loved to have seen more focus in this area.

Book donation programs should reflect a partnership between institutions in Africa and the US with a liaison contact from each institution.

Community based, grassroot project involvement with benefit to broad, non-sectarian populations are encouraged.
If there is no such construction of meaning, then, the state’s intervention in the public sphere will be exposed as an exercise in the defense of specific interests and naked power, triggering a legitimation crisis... That is, the state will be seen as an instrument of domination rather than an institution of representation. There is no legitimation without consent based on shared meaning....

Located in the Renaissance Indianapolis hotel on North Meridian, Grille 39 may be ignored because it is a hotel restaurant. Usually, if you live in the area, you don’t visit hotels thus ignoring the restaurants within. As someone who travels for work, I have no problem with many hotel restaurants. In this case, I was looking forward to the atmosphere that blended well with the Renaissance feel of earthly elements. Together, the two fit nicely, and I was impressed with the overall experience of the restaurant that evening.

9) Well, I love reading, writing, photography, and fashion! TBA is a great way for me to incorporate all of those things together. Right now I'm actually working on a novel that someday I'd like to get published. I recently started a Bucket List as well, hoping to add on more things soon. I've always wanted to model, and have had opportunites to but my parents don't want me to because they think that it'd make me compromise my standards too much.

They walked me to suite 2, a nice big birthing room, hooked up my IV, and told me to walk the halls to try to get the contractions and dilation going. My parents arrived and the four (5) of us started walking. I took a couple of breaks to sit on the birthing ball, played Bananagrams, and then my contractions started to pick up a little bit around 11:00 or 12:00. At 11:30 I was still only 2cm and since it had been almost 6 hours since my water broke, we started a low dose of pitocin. At 1:30 the contractions were getting a lot worse, so I got an epidural. At 2:00 I was already 5cm dilated. I was really shaky after the epidural and really anxious, so the next couple of hours weren't the most fun. At 4:15 I was 7cm and they upped the pitocin a bit, telling me I'd probably be ready to push in about an hour. Then I started to feel the contractions again, even with the epidural. I had to breathe through them and asked for a bump up in my epidural meds. I wish I hadn't because it just made my legs completely numb but I could still feel major contractions in my stomach. At 5:20 I was 9cm and they told me to let them know when I felt pressure and needed to push. My contractions were coming with only a 30 second or so break in between. Sometime between then and 5:45 I felt the sensation of pressure and asked to be checked, I was 10cm and ready to push. He was face down, unlike my daughter, who was face up and it took me three hours to push her out. They called for my MFM while the resident and nurse prepped the room. It was SO hard not to push and to breathe through these intense contractions. I had to breathe through them for about 5 minutes waiting for my doctor and I was worried he would just pop right out! Once she got there I put my legs up in the stirrups and pushed with the next contraction, they could see his head, my husband peeked, I asked if he had hair and he said he did. Another contraction and some more pushing, they said I was doing great. I remember being worried that I couldn't hear him on the fetal monitor anymore, so I was determined to push effectively and get him here as fast as I could. It was only a total of 5 or 6 contractions, my husband said "here he comes!" and I felt him slide out, he cried within seconds and it was the most beautiful sound in the world. After my doctor cut the cord (my husband had zero interest in doing that with either of our children), they put him on my chest and I couldn't take my eyes off of him. I was oblivious to the world around me where they were busy delivering the placenta and stitching up a second degree tear (I tore where I did with my daughter). His Apgars were 9 and 9. He weighed 7lbs. 8.8oz., 19.5" long and born at 6:11PM on May 3, 2012. He and my daughter are the most amazing, awe inspiring, loves of my life. I feel so blessed to be given these treasures and I will spend every day of the rest of my life loving them always and forever.
I sure hope all this rain and mild winter means a better growing season this year. Lord knows we need one.

This morning was a perfect example. I was thinking of all the “what ifs” and “why me” when I opened my daily devotional from Proverbs 31 Ministries. Immediately, this jumped off the screen at me.

BrewDog have had an almost unbelievable rise to the forefront of British brewing since their inception in 2007 to become the biggest independent brewer in Scotland. At first I was curious and bought a couple of their bottles that was available from the supermarkets at the time.I found them tasty and welcomed them as an alternative to other bottled beers that I regularly bought. More recently though I have started to tire of the BrewDog shock tactic marketing machine. The End of History beers which were housed inside dead stoats and squirrels seemed to me to be in very bad taste and a cheap way of getting mass media coverage, not to mention hiring a dwarf to stand with a placard outside the Houses of Parliament for a week to campaign for selling beer in smaller measures.
that happiness was the moment when you found salary have been banked in! But, overnight, your paycheck will need to cover debt from credit cards, insurance, utilities, petrol, rental, investment and many expenses. That's the reason I said the joy only last for 24 hours.

Down the cave they descended into the underworld. Suddenly they were stopped by a pit filled with scorpions and snakes. They descended into the pit. The snakes bit them and scorpions stung. But they just walked over and crossed over to the other side for they were immune to all forms of poisons. Next they had to cross a river of pus and blood. The river looked so gory that any normal human would have fainted at its very sight. But here were the earth’s two most powerful wizards. They coolly swam through the blood and the pus. Their success in crossing these obstacles emboldened them. Their initial fear was now gone. Was this all the Lords had? They felt confident about facing the underworld Lords.
Another chapter explores alternates to hops, malt, and yeast. Wormwood wit whiskey, anyone? Chamomile wheat whiskey? How about an elderflower Bohemian pilsner whiskey, barley sochu, mint-chocolate milk stout whiskey, or cannabis moonshine? I’ve yet to taste a yeast-free whiskey, but Bell lays out how to make a soured barley example fermented with the bacteria Brettanomyces lambicus, so familiar to lovers of Belgian lambic beers.

Anyway, just to be completely clear; even if a working cure was developed today, it would probably be a decade before it passed enough clinical trials to be approved for general use.
After we'd all piled in the car and were headed home Raine nearly unhinged my jaw with the comment, 'Next time we need to go on a train with a steam engine.' Dave piped in with, 'Go on the steam train like the choo-choo!' (I'm not sure I could translate that, but it sounded like he agreed) So it seems that not only was I wasting guilt, I completely missed the opportunity to bask in some well deserved glory. I hate when that happens. My father used to say (and might still) that 'The sun will even smile on a dog's ass someday.' Well, I am that dog's ass, and that day I was just basking in the rays. Now excuse me, I have to go talk to a man about a steam train.
I don't have any chocolate in the house to test out the pairing capabilities, but to be honest, this beer is sweet enough as it is. Give it a try, I advise, at your neighborhood craft bar.

7) In 1953, the old house landed in the hands of renown Broadway stage designer Oliver Smith, responsible for the original scenery from great American musicals like Oklahoma!, Guys and Dolls and West Side Story. In his lifetime, he was nominated for 25 Tony Awards. With some of his earnings from the musical On The Town, Smith bought 70 Willow Street and lived here until he died in 1994.
doing a general check around Argyle Dam, Grant radioed in a pack of wild dogs he had spotted on the tar road on his way back to Motswari. I rushed in their direction, the problem being they were heading south and I was trying to catch up with them from further north. Luckily we met them just before Ntsiri airstrip. It was a great sighting and then suddenly, further up the road, a leopard popped out. It got the fright of it’s life on seeing the pack of dogs, and dogs being dogs, could not resist a cat chase. The pack flew off after the leopard and disappeared into the bush. The cat was too quick for the dogs that soon lost interest and returned to the tar road for another good view before taking

I adopted this policy in a spirit of both self-interest and altruism. In the blogosphere links are like capital. By offering links to others, others would be more inclined to offer links to me. But I am also very grateful to those who helped me out by throwing a link my way or adding me to their blogroll when I was just starting out. Now that I am a Large Mammal, according the Truth Laid Bear Ecosystem, I have tried to return the favor by helping out those further down the food chain. And I also think linking to others who have linked to me is the polite thing to do. While I don't think my blogroll policy is enough to qualify me for a Nobel Peace Prize like Al Gore or Rush Limbaugh, I do hope that my efforts to spread a little love around the blogosphere makes cyberspace a little safer for democracy. I believe it was those great conservative rockers the Beatles who said, "The love you make is equal to the love you take."

8. Winds Of Death (Angel Of Light) (new song)
night or day
The Orthodox dogma of our redemption—which includes the doctrines concerning Christ’s incarnation, death and Resurrection—is the chief dogma of our Faith, together with the dogma of the Holy Trinity. I have been especially contemplating and reading Patristic writings on this subject for a few years now. It is a vast subject. In this lecture I will try to outline its main points in a linear and chronological fashion. I will speak about the state of man before the Fall and after the Fall, and then speak about how Christ saved us from the consequences of the Fall through His incarnation, death and Resurrection. Finally, I will summarize all the present and future accomplishments of Christ’s redemptive work.
It was such an amazing project, and we treasure working with kids. Kids mean a lot to use, but I guess that is obvious! Winegard Elementary really needed some help, and it made us so happy to give those kids some inspiration and the materials to make music, and in vibrant, stimulating surroundings. The principal of the school was a true rockstar, and we were privileged to work with her.
I don't know about you - but life is definitely hectic here and I'm still wrapping last minute gifts and buying food and trying to stay calm!! :) This will be my last post before Christmas, so I want to wish you all a truly Merry Christmas, full of love, joy and peace! (And hopefully a couple of special goodies under the tree!!) :)
“Yes, child,” the stick replied with a sigh. “But, I think we are quite past that by now. Have you not heard me? You have been Chosen.”
I had to buy it. Discovering that the two-slice package cost just one pound, I had to buy two. I told the butcher that my husband has been threatening for years to make haggis. The butcher laughed, “That’s quite a threat.” He sold me the haggis, assuring me that it would be fine for the flight home. And it was. I…..um…..did not declare it when I went through customs. (It was hermetically sealed. It was fine.) Come to find out, though, that until 2010 haggis was not permitted to come into the country. It may have had something to do with mad cow disease, or perhaps U.S. Customs decided that we just have certain aesthetic standards to uphold.

She gave it to him, then walked stiffly down the pompous staircase, head up and one hand on the broad marble balustrade, the other hand trailing the perhaps-bag. The boys in leather jackets watched her all the way down to the hall. And Landau, while he popped the card into his top pocket with the half-dozen others he'd collected in the last two hours, saw them watch her and gave the boys a wink. And the boys after due reflection winked back at him, because this was a new season of openness when a pair of good Russian hips could be acknowledged for what they were, even to a foreigner.
Me? I’m knitting. Trying to get Christmas knitting finished. I have 3 gifts completed and I’m working on a fourth. The fifth is already planned, so I’ve got plenty to keep me occupied. (Rugrats via Netflix is pretty popular around here these days!)
Many of these studies, which often go on to praise the gentleness and tolerance of black men, are written by so called feminists, for whom the protection of women was clearly not a priority. To protect oneself, one has first to be in possession of the true facts, however, any woman believing such writing would be as safe as if she were sent on safari in the belief that zebra were dangerous but that lions were harmless and could generally be petted.
At the BBC website today, Stephanie Flanders (who is no slouch) has been analysing German behaviour over the EFSF in particular and the debt crisis in general. Her conclusion is a very pro-German one – ‘they’re doing it to bring democracy back to the EU’ being the Sun-conclusion.
Most fans tell me they read it in two days.
Unfortunately I can’t explain all the trends because that will take too long. The main thing about this presentation was that we have to think about how Google effects Amsterdam. Google has a huge impact on image building because so many people start their search through this search engine. The first results that are shown may create a wrong image of the city. We also have to think about how our future campaigns have to found through Google. What will be the first shown results? And what kind of effect will they have?
Never.

5.) Now that you've done that, painted your nails, replied to all of your emails, and whatever else you can accomplish is 2 and 1/2 hours, you can check on your beans. When they are perfect, it won't be huge effort to chew one and they will be easily mashable with a fork. At that time, you can add in your "sofrito", as well as some canned or fresh diced tomatoes (1/2 cup per cup of beans is good, but add more for saucier beans), and some cumin. I also add in cayenne pepper at this point, and a pinch of paprika. Beans eat up spices so you need not be stingy, and feel free to be creative. (Like if you are one of those cilantro types.)
The mixture for this had to be quite thick, I guess to suspend the blueberries and create a nice sturdy sponge too. It works really well. My new tin was also great! - no greasing this baby before cooking, and the cooked cake sprung out like a dream!

MOONLIGHT YOUNG PALE ALE is an orange-tinged, very hoppy pale ale. It’s spicy as all get out. You ever tried THREE FLOYDS ALPHA KING before? It’s that kind of pale ale – the one that’s really a strong, intense India Pale ale hiding behind the “American pale ale” category. Malts were interacting with spices interacting with big-ass hops – wow. This is the best beer I’ve had from Moonlight in a couple of years, and I even had my all-time fave pilsner REALITY CZECH just the other evening. I hope this one turns up in more locales in 2010 because you’re gonna want this one. 8.5/10.
Most of the time I eat the same thing each day for breakfast and lunch, with small variations. But supper time is when I change it up and try to find new things to eat. I have a few options I haven't tried yet but are on my list. They involve huge portabella mushroom caps. I'm loving me some mushrooms lately.
Told by diary entries, newspaper articles, and letters, the novel gets going a little slowly, but eventually enthralls. Kingsolver does a great job of creating colorful and believable characters from the lives of real, historic people, something that is not simple, and completely involves readers in the events of their lives.
Found this entry in my Penzu account, written during a trying time for the members of my beloved college org. I was already an alumna by this time, but I couldn’t help the outpouring of emotions. Note: I had to delete some of the lines containing particulars from the application process.

Chance Encounters is a quick read. Caroline is a likable character, even as she struggles so fiercely in the midst of this "love triangle." Rather than just blindly following passion, Caroline really does try to figure out how to do things right -- it just takes her a while to figure out what "right" is. While I've never been in her situation, I was able to understand her. And Bailey is awesome! As are Tommy and Alex (you'll have to read it yourself to find out who and why). I'd definitely recommend this as a quick read for when you want something fun but not fluffy.
The demi-fey are brutally murders and arranged after a picture in a children’s story book. And Merry is called in because of her knowledge of the fey and who could have done it. Merry decides to warn the other demi-fey about the murders and in doing so they discover a witness to these murders. They start to question her. But the fairy godmother gets wind of this and swoops in to the rescue of bittersweet, the witness.

There are many women out there who are emotional fuckwittages, and lately we've had to deal with one in particular. It always surprises me when people just aren't willing to admit they got something wrong, or that they're taking their emotions (read irritation and frustration) out on people who have nothing to do with it. And refuse to acknowledge that they are doing something wrong, and refuse to apologise for it later. And even think that the other person should be the one apologising.
Hello everyone i actually have quite a few things to share but for today i will share with you my doll i made with Shelagh Folgates online smashee class. This was our January's class and was called hubble bubble. I decided to call mine Gisella as i looked up the name and it says it means promise . I will have her sit in my small studio with me and she can be a reminder of a promise i made to myself to be more creative this year and try some new things which up to date i have been doing ( will share some of the stuff i have been doing very soon ) .

At the very back of this picture you can see Mt. Ogden where the downhill races were held in the 2002 Olympics. One can still ski the downhill course but it has a very narrow and steep entry designed to give the contestants a fast start. The rest of us have to scrub speed on it and the result is a narrow and difficult mogul field that has nothing to do with down hill racing. But it is still fun.
Perhaps the gang leader wanted to play D&D for the same reason I played; and why I read 20,000 Leagues under the Sea…and the Hobbit…and all the Choose Your Own Adventure books by Edward Packard and R.A. Montgomery…to escape. As atypical as my “at-risk” life was, it was still an “at-risk” life and I sought to escape it – and indeed, this world in which I, and my people, have suffered so much – and, for a while at least, explore brighter horizons.
She followed it up with "Alentejo Blue" in 2006, a much quieter book than her first, set among a multi-ethnic community in a Polish small town. A significant departure from her first, widely appreciated book, "Alentejo Blue" received at best lukewarm reviews.
You’re going to act like an idiot in a relationship. You’re going to accuse your partner of cheating on you IN A DREAM! Realize that in your true relationship – the one you’re supposed to be in – you’ll re-enact every good and bad co-dependent/ non-healthy thing that happened to you as a child with your parents. All of these weird tics and foibles will slide into the forefront in your intimate relationships. Realize that, though they should be noted, they are in your past and not your present. When you act like a crazy person, admit it, and laugh at yourself.
Politicians of all colours find it difficult to hold rallies or approach the people – they are often verbally attacked and in some cases physically attacked with water bottles. So far the only injury has been to the politicians’pride but Greek society is steadily poisoned by this lack of values and seriousness.

As the pair of Chinese troops worked themselves deeper into the swamp, the lone American picked up their trail. They moved like men much more accustomed to marching in formation than navigating difficult terrain. As they cast back and forth for sign, they followed a rigid zig-zag pattern virtually oblivious to the natural flow of the swamp and its terrain.

FORDA had prepared a draft document, which the workshop discussed in detail. The draft stated that the vision of the strategy was ‘agroforestry mainstreamed into forestry development in Indonesia and widely adopted by the community as a forestry and land-use system to meet sustainable forest management goals for improving people’s livelihoods and sustaining natural resources’.
You know though- everyone changes. I still would be a different person than I was last year regardless if I was dancing my rear off every day. I guess I'm just really happy to be where I am right now- my life is sorta awesome.
Must get on with my other blog as well before my brain goes !! I have been finding it quite easy to remember my childhood and all the people and places but I daresay that one day things will not be so clear.

Ramune is a modern symbol of summer in Japan and is often enjoyed by all ages all over Asia. The drink is commonly associated with hot summer nights and is frequently drunk during summer festivals. The drink was first introduced in Kobe, Japan, in 1884 by the Scottish entrepreneur Alexander Cameron Sim who first advertised it to the local populous as a preventative for Cholera, since then the drink has gone on to become ingrained into Japanese culture, even a bottle makes its way into ‘My Neighbour Totoro’!

Overall I felt very good and strong. I was able to stay with the pace leader until about mile 17 or so when I started to ride the pain train. My legs were beginning to feel pretty tight around mile 20 and I knew that a 3:30 was out of reach. At that point, I focused on 3:40 or better. I figured all I had to do was not get passed by the 3:40 pace leader and I would be alright.
Ya think Magee? I gave birth to her. She counts on me for everything but her breath and her heartbeat. I'm pretty sure she knows I'm not someone who just walked up. And she is not 4 months old. She can't use her body. Her brain is intact.
Here is a shot of the finished card. I only colored 2 flowers because I knew I would be cutting them off and wanted to waste as little as possible. The thing I like best about watercoloring is it leaves room for imperfections, and being the perfectionist that I am I need a medium that can be forgiving of my mistakes at times. It's also easy to add and take away color with watercolor which is a nice feature as well (more wiggle room for correcting mistakes).
I think about my travels in life, from misadventures to deployments in the Army to now regular vacation trips, and this bears out the truth of my philosophy above. What mostly comes to mind is the little mishaps and obstacles getting there, not so the being there. Traveling one time from eastern Romania to Atlanta, Georgia to meet a friend flying in from Fairbanks, Alaska, the most memorable part of the trip was a ten-seat airport bar counter in Aviano Italy where I ended up staying the night because I got pick-pocketed by a chickpea that I had spurned earlier. Luckily I still had my American Armed Forces ID card and an expired US Passport in my coat pocket, just no money until my grandparents could overnight mail a bank card from my credit union in Texas to the hotel in Atlanta. Luckily I had enough cash in my front pocket, a traveler's trick against pick-pockets, to cover my tab and just had to wait for the flight out at 6:15am. My credit card company would get me a new card by the end of the month at my address in Germany. How exactly was I going to get from the airport in Atlanta to the hotel? Well, it wouldn't be the first time I had to panhandle for subway change. It would actually be the second. Boy, bar stools were not designed for sleeping on but they're better than boarding area benches.

The only possible threat that may justify the introduction of preventive law is international terrorism, for which we must have a precise definition for “terrorism” — unlike the wide ranging and non-defined offences included in the Bill — so as to eliminate abuse of the law. For such guidance, we can look to the existing conventions of the United Nations, which is in tune with universally accepted values.
The No Rules Handbook for Writers felt a little suffocated by its own fixed structure, its own narrative. A book about breaking the rules should break some itself, and in the end I felt that the format of the book was trapping some of the thoughts within it.

- Shift your focus off of self-contempt. If we’re focused on hating ourselves, realize that we’re focused on ourselves and not on him. Self-contempt is a subtle form of self-centeredness, which is the opposite of Christ-centeredness. Unless our self-contempt makes us look more at the righteousness of Christ and the cross of Christ and less at ourselves, the whole endeavor leads to death. Let our sin break our hearts but not our hope in the gospel.
In the not-too-distant future, an independent contractor named Jack Holloway working for megacorporation ZaraCorp finds a vein of rare sunstone that is worth billions. Shortly thereafter, he finds an adorable race of bipedal cat-like creatures that may be sentient, which would void ZaraCorp’s contract to strip the planet of resources and thus cause a lot of very wealthy people to miss out on becoming exponentially moreso. Although Holloway has no problem with manipulating people around him to fuel his own selfish needs, the little creatures he calls fuzzies start to warm this very Han Solo-like character’s heart.
The resort has a restaurant aboard the Clear Lake Queen, but on our first night there we went about 100 feet down the road and found excellent food at Zino’s. It’s a small, unimpressive-looking place from the outside, but the owner, who is also the host and server, was very gracious and the lake view was excellent. My meal was fine (I had the leftovers for lunch the next day), but what I really loved was the soup.

Fifteen years ago on this very day...I married my best friend! The man the Lord picked out for me, in good times and in bad (and we've had our share of both) to journey not only through life with, but more importantly through our walk with the Lord.

The boys and I had traveled to the Wisconsin Parents Association conference, an annual event that that refreshes, recharges and re-energizes me. I'd agreed to present three sessions at the conference: Homeschooling Boys, Let's Make Paper Airplanes and Boundless Energy: Dealing with Boy Energy. The first two were sessions I'd done before. Boundless Energy was a new one for me, created as a direct response to comments and questions from participants who attended my Homeschooling Boys session last year.

So, after T tells me that he is quite lovely and she would love to get her hands on him (figuratively, she has too many hip problems to actually ride anymore), I slowly walked him back to the barn. I was completely and totally disappointed. Damn it. I already have a lame, retired horse....I want one I can ride! *tears*

This track is pretty flat, so in order to work my leg muscles a bit harder I also use the treadmill to do hill repeats. Initially I planned to go to the You Yangs and climb up to Flinders peak, but the track is closed for renovations until later in the year.
He jumped off the bed and stuck his finger in her face “How could you do this to me! You promised me that you would be there after dad died! Do you know how much it kills me to have to come here? I hate it and I hate you for this! You can remember every goddamn Christmas carol but you can’t even remember your own son? Look at me. Look at my face. I’m your son, mom! Do you think I like coming here; having to explain to you over and over again that I’m your child? It tears me up that I feel this way about you, mom because I love you so much. You’ve made me into something I never wanted to be. I don’t want to be this person but I can’t pretend that I’m happy. I can’t explain this to my wife or my family. Every time you ask me who I am, you cut away at another part of the person I used to be. I don’t have it left to give to you. I can’t keep coming here and doing this to myself. I wish you would just wake up and be who you were before but I know that’s not going to happen. I’m not going to force myself to watch you fade away!”

Denzel Washington is once again playing another great role here as Jake. This is one of the first roles that shows Denzel in a very subdued and laid-back feel rather than being that hero type and going all-over-the-place with his emotions and it’s also one of those rich performances that gives you the kind of comfort that you should feel whenever he’s on-screen. The character he’s playing may be a guy that is obviously effed up in the head, but he is also a guy that you know is good and only wants to do the right thing which is what makes this character so much richer and better, especially because he’s being played by the man himself.

Working at a Foxconn factory is difficult. The Fair Labor Association (FLA) recently published its year long, 3 factory, audit of Foxconn facilities in China. There is no way to sugar- coat the findings. “All three factories violated the FLA code standard of 60 working hours per week as well as the Chinese legal limits of 40 working hours per week and 36 hours maximum of overtime per month. it found that during peak production season, the average hours worked per week exceeded 60 hours per worker. In addition, there were periods in which some employees worked more than seven days in a row without the required 24 hours off (FLA)”. Not only were hours long, but compensation was minimal. In its iEconomy series, the New York Times calculated that the average Foxconn factory worker makes between $1.50 and $2.20 an hour. This equates to approximately $17 a day for most employees (iEconomy, Economix Editors). Finally there are horror stories of terrible working conditions in the plants. On May 20th of 2011, there was an explosion that required dozens of fire trucks to extinguish. Two workers were found dead while a dozen others were injured (Foxconn Explosion, Diaz). Additionally, some employees say that they have stood for so long that their legs swelled up and they were no longer able to walk. Some reports have cited multiple deaths due to exhaustion (Another Foxconn Employee, China Labor Watch). Foxconn has also been accused of improperly disposing of toxic chemicals. Two employees in 2011 were injured after being ordered to use hazardous chemicals to clean iPhone screens. Finally, there have been reports of underage workers at the facilities. These infractions all amount to what are improper and unacceptable standards for those who live and work at Foxconn. An individual should not have to fear for his safety in order to properly assemble a product like the ones made in these facilities.
.....can I please be 18 already? I mean, don't think I'm ungrateful for making it 15 years, but...... that script contest won't accept submissions from people under 18...... dang......
We did a little more shopping and then went to a traditional Chinese restaurant with our guide and the other AAC family. We asked her to order for us but I said, "Maybe keep it to beef, pork, or chicken." She said, "Ok, so no snake?" ;) She chose well and we enjoyed a yummy lunch. I have to say that most of the food we've tried has been really good but that first mom & pop shop we ate at was sooo good and cheaper than the other places we've eaten.
The most oft sited is Leviticus 18:22: Don't have sex with another guy.
I first met Guilt when I was 7 years old, at a party thrown by Irish nuns in the basement of Sacred Heart Cathedral. The theme for this little soiree was ‘Preparation for the Sacrament of Reconciliation.’ There was no wine (which frankly, I found odd), but there were definitely streamers. And talk of white veils and shiny shoes, so I was totally in.
September 25, 2008- There are two things that make my writing just flow so fast that my hand has trouble keeping up with my thoughts: inspiration and motivation.
- To replace the broken wall and add an embankment to it - or possibly even build a wall and embankment closer to my house and the BAPMAF premises. Even though I will lose my garden this will keep the building premises intact - so that in the future and the government demolishes obstacles to the water course, stops the saw-miller dumping saw dust in rivers and get the Highways Authority to build a storm drain alongside the Achimota-Ofankor Highway --I could at least use the BAPMAF premises again.
Mine was made for my mother by her uncle in Australia, and the hidden treasure it contains is not a minature library but something with its own story to tell; a piece of coral from the Great Barrier Reef.
About 33% of dropouts will collect food stamps, twice the share of graduates, and fewer than half will own a home. And such bleak figures tend to be passed down to their children.
Being twenty-five and enthusiastic, as well as being less likely to chew matches because I might get a splinter and, you know, mouth ulcers are ever so, ever so sore, I proceeded to give him a demonstration about why it wasn't good to be too scared of rats, because they were everywhere in a place like this. I thumped the corrugated iron cladding on the side of the barn wall in which we were standing, and was rewarded with a huge amount of scuttling and running as the hordes of rats behind scrambled for deeper hiding places.

Day 17: time - maybe a split shot of the time entered and time leaving IKEA. I think we spent nearly two hours there and managed to only buy 1 thing not on our shopping list - some tealight candles. Walked out with some curtains for the living room and a new light for the mudroom. That's a miracle!
I think we all feel compelled to be good friends… to everyone… even to people we barely know. To these new friends-of-friends who we don’t really click with. To old friends who are too needy or too demanding. We even feel compelled to befriend or remain friends with people whom we really don’t like. But one of the freedoms of getting older should be not feeling badly when things don’t work out. To bid adieu and move on. Even before things have properly started.
Happy now, C.A.T.? What? You want me to…? Oh all right…

I agree with all of these priorities. Shall we examine Harper’s contributions thus far?
Jeff: In general, any sort of advice that presumes to apply to all writers is suspect. Everyone is different, everyone has a different style and approach. One thing I used to hear a lot that definitely isn’t true is that you have to write everyday in order to be a good writer. I think it’s more important to live a courageous and interesting life everyday in order to be a good writer.
The Governor’s Mansion originally consisted of that four rooms and a hallway plan, with the first floor consisting of two parlors to the north of the hall and a library and dining room to the south, and four bedrooms upstairs. The kitchen was put in a separate building to the west of the house for reasons of fire safety. Within a year, though, the service ell was attached to the house and a second story was added to that wing for servants.
But then again i guess you’re not going to get ahead in life by writing blogs either…
My cycle didn't seem normal (but what is normal with PCOS?) for the next couple months and I was having a lot of problems with pain. I ended up with a D & C after all, along with a polyp-ectomy surgery. Now I am two full cycles past my surgery and wondering if I should "let nature take its course" and "forgetting about trying to conceive" or do we go for more medical intervention?
Anyway, I really like the song, its quite good to run to and its got that synth heavy 80s sound that I’m a fan of. Its a fairly simple, but cool pop track, and includes the fantastic lyric:
On Sunday
How we struggle to trust God with our children. Our finances. Our emotional well-being. We worry. We fret. And wonder why we have no peace.
Senta, meanwhile, grows up to be Orla Boylan - except that she doesn't. She's still living that fairy tale, her emotional world twisted into an alternative reality by the lack of emotional substance around her. She works in a factory making ships in bottles - the set (designed by Paul Brown) is magnificent, with a vast window and plenty of wood suggesting past glories for this Norwegian one-ghost suburb. Her refuge is the image of the Dutchman: her own longing, her own clinging to belief in the redemptive power of love and compassion. There's none of that in her real world. Even Erik (sung by Stuart Skelton, who is an absolute knockout of a Heldentenor) is no answer. He's a security guard at the factory and there's a hint of violence, born of frustration, in his treatment of her; this big guy doesn't know his own strength. And the other girls pick on her: she's the mildly deranged fat lump in the pink dress (Primark?) who pooh-poohs their sluttishness.
For me, it's time to renew my love of play and pleasure, knowing Life is not forever, and that this really does apply to me. Voilá - the mid-life crisis! Sometimes, it's OK to live a cliché...take up flamenco dancing, and fall in love with a car.
Louisville got hit last night with a few, one of which came damn close to us. I thought for a while that we wouldn't have to pay to have our backyard tree brought down after all. It was a nail biter. A few horse barns were demolished on the backside of Churchill Downs. The horse owners arrived to find horses wandering around like nothing happened. If you believed the news we had five tornados briefly touch down, all F1's and F-2's.

Now I knew from studying the route beforehand that the direct line to Porthcawl took us just to the west of Pen-y-Fan, so as we drifted south of Brecon I realised that we could use the Beacons to make some significant progress crosswind, unless of course we found a boomer that took us right over them in the meantime.

Why this works for me: sure, it might seem best to knock out all of your homework before dinner. The problem is, overtime, this can really take a toll on your motivation. If you allow the time you spend doing homework to be associated with watching fifteen minutes of Glee, it makes the whole process feel less like a chore, making you more efficient in the long run.
None of the passing vehicles (not that there were that many) had any extra gas – and in fact most of them were diesel. Dusk was approaching, and because of the situation in the region at that time, it was not recommended for anyone – let alone a foreigner – to walk the 5km to the nearest gas station.
“The news!” he exclaims. “I’ll tell you what the fucking news is! The students have been rioting! Swarms of them took to the streets, defacing monuments and hurling flower pots. Can you imagine wasting good flower pots like that? It’s a good thing it’s not summer, or the streets would be stinking with their horrible fucking body odour!”
“Friar, unfortunately, your position boils down to: criticize ‘the pope’ but don’t dare do so to the SSPX, thereby effectively attributing infallibility to the Society, and judging ‘the pope.’” – Rob, a Sedevacantist
In 1957 he starred in The king of New York where he was the first film-maker to dare to expose, through satire and ridicule, the paranoia and political intolerance which overtook the United States in the Cold War period. It would be another 16 years untill it was actually screened in America, such was its daring. He stareed as the deposed kink of Estovia who flees to America where he is tormentd by a McCarthy style investigation.

In 1874 when Mercer Association missionary Reverend J. D. Evans came to Ray’s Mill, Thomas M. Ray was deeply moved by the baptist’s message. Thomas M. Ray must have attended the church meetings in the old log school house and the big revivals that were held in May and July, for he became instrumental in the formation of a Baptist Church at Ray’s Mill (see Men at Beaver Dam Baptist Church.) On September 20, 1874 a small group of followers met with Reverend J. D. Evans at the home of Thomas and Mary Ray to organize the church. Thomas M. Ray. and D. J. McGee were elected to represent the new church to the Mercer Baptist Association and were sent as messengers to the Valdosta Church. The Reverend J. D. Evans wrote a petitionary letter which they carried to the association. In November 1874 Thomas M. Ray was appointed to a church building committee along with James M. Baskin and D. J. McGee. He served on the committed that selected and procured the site for the construction of the church building. He continued to serve on the building committee until his death.

My soul thirsts for you my Lord. I feel my heart broken and I want to close it tight and protect myself from all that hurts me. But then I close my heart to You, oh, Lord. So let it remain broken, and open. Then You can see inside me and come inside to heal. I remember better times when Your glory shined so brilliantly that I shouted out joy and praise. But now, in the darkness of my shame and insecurity, is it all just a dream? My soul thirsts for you my Lord. Your heavenly cup flows over me gently and my broken heart aches for You. Restore me. Let me come to rest upon You. You never leave me.
(6) Behind the written story (of Abram and Sarai) is doubtless an oral tradition of considerable age, a tradition that might have been mainly directed to the celebration of the beauty of Sarai, which would have made her desirable to others (notice that it is kings who desire her) and of course put her marriage to Abram in jeopardy. In any case the author of the second version, in chapter 20, retold the story with some basic changes, presumably to substitute the author’s own emphases; the author of the third version did the same thing in chapter 26. The final redactor who wove all three into the texture of the Genesis narrative may well have understood their meaning no better than we do, but since he could have retarded them all as history, he did not have to feel obliged to figure them out.

As writers it is important to stretch ourselves beyond what we normally write. This is something I learned in a great critique group in Omaha NE, where we would always start our meetings with a short class on some form of writing. This is where I was encouraged to write poetry, although that is not my medium of choice, and I learned how to write with more conciseness.

In January, when discussing the Iowa Caucus, Mitchell said that the rap on Iowa was that it didn’t represent the rest of the country because it was “Too White, Too Evangelical, Too Rural.” More recently she suggested, without any verifiable proof, that Romney’s family entered the country illegally from Mexico.

BabyE is a cruising. She actually started crawling navy seal style at 7 ½ months, but since 8 ½ months she’s found her fast flight knees and now she is a lightning bolt crawler. Her fast flight knees seem to take her everywhere, especially from the scene of a crime, like after pulling down mommy’s CDs. It’s so amazing to watch her discover her feet, but I’m secretly dreading her first steps. There will be more falls, some bruises (I hope not too many) some running away when mommy calls and even more independence *roll eyes*. Before, I could hold her in my arms and she’s go where I go, without ever complaining; now that she is about to break out on her own, it’s a little bit scary.

All you need is a packet or tub of good quality anchovies – you could use those jars of little hairy ones but it won’t be anywhere near as ‘WIN’ as the soft marinated ones, a tin of tomato paste, freshly grated parmesan, bread sliced about 1/2cm thick and some freshly torn basil leaves. Simply spread a sparing layer of tomato paste onto the bread slices, top with parmesan, half an anchovy and some basil leaves then place under grill until parmesan begins to melt.
Good morning, Dear Readers, and happy Monday. Today, at the urging of some of my lovely Twitter friends and followers, I intend to tackle a controversial topic.

I made a Homemaking Binder about 3 months ago, maybe less. I’ve been wanting to do a post on it because I LOVE this idea and it has helped me out a lot, but it has gotten so big that I rarely pull it out anymore and so that is another reason I want to do this challenge. I want to perfect my Homemaking binder idea and make it more workable for me and my family. Here are some examples of what I use to plan my weekly and daily schedules. I often ignore them, but like I said, I’m still perfecting this process.

“Broken windows” has assumed almost talismanic status among many policymakers. Politicians have embraced Wilson’s ideas, especially at the municipal level, leading to zero tolerance programs that crack down on graffiti, drug use, and other nonviolent offenses. Even before Rudy Giuliani rode into New York to declare war on artists, the homeless, street vendors and other public menaces, Ed Koch spent millions to scrub the subways of spraypaint and fight the young artists who tagged the city’s train yards. (This, as hip-hop historian Jeff Chang points out, at a time when NYC still struggled financially, and justified cuts to social services due to a chronic shortage of funds.)

Boxing has been a feature of the modern Olympics for over 100 years, with some of the sport’s biggest names coming to prominence during the Games.

The doctor’s name is Billimoria, but Dad’s names for him make me laugh, so I call him Bubbalongname, too.
Megan Roberts is a young, prolific North Carolina writer who has that one quality that all writers covet: she is able to genre-hop between fiction and poetry effortlessly. While her MFA is in fiction writing, her poems have appeared in several literary journals and won awards.

When my husband is home with the children, he tends to get them to behave, clean the house to its sparkling finest, and be relatively calm upon my return. I want things to go well in my absence, but not TOO well.

In matters of creating life or avoiding death, I have no answers. It is a mystery and always will be. My husband and I have had a difficult path. I am certainly struggling with and grieving over our recent failed attempts to add to our family. There's an emptiness that remains after the drugs and doctor's appointments stop, after the fight is over and all that is left is the sad reality. The reality is that in creating a life, there is only so much one can do. I am not sure where our journey will lead us now. Many of the tears I shed these past couple of weeks have been in gratitude for my daughter. I can’t explain why she is here any better than I can explain why the Chilean miners are alive today. But I promise to cherish my daughter and never take her life for granted.
Not long ago, when Bountygate first broke, I gave my thoughts on the situation and shared what I felt should have happened to Gregg Williams. The suspensions that were handed down are sufficient at best, but to think that this type of thing will end with the Saints and Williams is to be naïve. The league has a major problem on its hands. This might scare teams from these types of incentives for a little while, but it hasn’t been flushed out by any means.

I got some lovely yarns to make a heavy wrap for winters around here and some new needles. My Mom got enough yarn to make a small top and some new needles as well. However, aside from knitty business I also was able to come away with a very fine Turkish rug (photo later). They were brought over by the shop owners (legally and authentically) and I got the last small one they had! It was good that we were able to keep things under control and finish up with just one visit... The shop was only three blocks down the street from our hotel!
One of my favourite new discoveries this year is the VeganYANerds blog.

I have to say, though, that the fear mongering has had an impact; the steady drumbeat of impending disaster has had an effect. Gallup polls over the past six decades have consistently shown that some 70% of the public strongly supports Social Security. But increasing numbers of young folks are becoming convinced that the system will not be there for them when they retire and so - and this has been part of the plan all along - their commitment to the program is weakened, making it easier to dismantle it entirely.
This slim volume, along with Ottoline's reflections on Cresswell's fellow New Zealander, the poet Kathryn Mansfield, friend to both, offers us another look into Ottoline's penchant for mentoring artists. Our Lady Bountiful supplied Cresswell with his longing for news from literary England after his return to New Zealand during the depths of the Depression in 1932. She sent him books & papers too costly for the poet. The pair shared a craving for Art, Beauty & companionship-
Virtually all the "art" in our kitchen has some sort of special meaning or purpose.... a picnic basket from a yard sale still fully functional, cake stands for entertaining, decorative plates from my childhood in Europe, a grinder like my mom & grandma used to make Grandma's cookies at Christmas, and then the LETTERs. Yes my husband has a LOVE of typography (as do I) so I thought I would incorporate that love into our kitchen.

Whilst escaping again they cross into German lines and are captured. The Doctor tries to persuade the German Lieutenant that they are not spies, and even demonstrates the Sonic Screwdriver by removing and replacing a screw from his revolver. In exactly the same way Smythe did, the German Major Von Weich uses a monocle to brainwash his Lieutenant. They manage to escape once more and head for the centre of the map, wherein we discover the next layer of this elaborate plot.

If you happen to have an obsessive love for chickens, there are many farm animal sanctuaries that rescue hens from poor environments. Sometimes those chickens lose their feathers and for many other reasons I probably don’t understand, sometimes they need sweaters. Really! I’m not making it up! So here is a link to a crochet hen sweater pattern. They keep mentioning this place called Little Hen Rescue, but I can’t really find that link anywhere and I don’t think it’s in the USA anyway. I’m sure, though, that if you’re a chicken enthusiast it won’t take you any time at all to hunt down a sanctuary near you that wouldn’t laugh in your face if you mentioned you can crochet and would they like some hen sweaters! Here in Kentucky I found a place called Home At Last Animal Sanctuary that says it’s a place that rescues farm animals

In all seriousness though I am a convert to the world of scam emails.

To be frank, Lew, I am rarely in the mood these days for a boozy or remotely heavy beer. I'd rather be able to have a "session" without feeling loaded or tired. Furthermore, there is something very special and sophisticated about a well made session beer, which is not an easy task for a brewer! I'm on a mini-mission to expose to people the beauty of a low abv, drinkable ale or lager. Bigger is not always better. I hope the american craft beer scene understands this in years to come and the philosophy of 'whiskey barrel aged 10% triple hopped continuously for 6 weeks and then aged in another barrel and wet hopped' is better" soon comes to a close and there is more emphasis put on balance and refinement! Hence good session beers. Yup. Sounds right to me.

When I saw the Tartan Boucle Blazer in the Anthropologie catalog last fall, I think my small fear of plaid was cured a little. I realized that plaid can be totally cute if worn the right way. I was able to score this cute blazer when it hit sale in December and I have to say, I love it! I have only worn it twice now but see it being a staple dress-up piece in my closet for years to come. I mean look how plaid has stood the test of time...all the way back from my high school days (and long before) to now. Timeless!
but is that because we just aren't looking for something new?

Anyway, I'll try to cut a long story short here; the surgeon examined Amy's ankle, called in another surgeon to scrutinise the XRays and they both concluded that there is no fracture but significant soft tissue damage. We then went to the plaster room where a large plaster-cast was applied, in a lovely purple colour as chosen by Amy, that will have to stay on for 2 weeks until we go back and have it looked at again. If the surgeon is happy that the tissue damage is healing then she will have the cast off and the injury will then be treated as a sprain.
it’s a shame.

The apartment she moves into in New York, while nice-looking, does not seem spacious in the way that commercial fantasies about "life in New York" often do; nor - if I recall - are there any guarantees that she even lives in Manhattan. (Imagine a happy professional woman living in - gasp! - an outer borough! One of the many execrable things about, say, Julie & Julia is how its contemporary scenes present Queens as a hellhole. For a movie about the magic of cooking, one would hope against hope that a movie would recognize the culinary miracle Queens represents. But I digress...) There's a tough scene in Morning Glory between Becky and her mother where the latter explains that this dream of "making it" in broadcasting was adorable at age ten, inspiring at age eighteen, and embarrassing at age twenty-eight. "Stop before it becomes heartbreaking."

So how did all this affect my own work? Well, in my early career I did several re-tellings of fairy tales, including Look Out, he’s Behind You! (Frances Lincoln, brilliantly illustrated by the excellent Margaret Chamberlain) a lift-the-flap- version of Little Red Riding Hood with the wolf hiding behind the flaps inside. It was first published in 1987, and has been one of my bestsellers. I still read it (or rather, I perform it!) on school visits. Kids love looking for the comical wolf who gets his comeuppance – although not before I drag the ending out, telling them that the Big Bad Wolf might jump out of the book and eat... a teacher or two. They know I’m joking, but there are always some nervous expressions in the room – and not just from the children, either.

Some people absolutely love asparagus. My best friend is one of them: upon starting a new diet she was super excited to learn that those woody little stems are on the approved (even encouraged) foods list, and she started cooking them up in nearly every dish she could think of. I however, am…not a fan. Hahaha. But so many people love this flavorful little vegetable, and this is the absolute perfect time of the year to get great, freshly-grown asparagus. It’s why May is National Asparagus Month!
My grandma's marinated cucumbers and onions were a summer staple through my childhood. The recipe is so good that it has become a time-honored tradition. My family is still eating them today. A July trip home to the farm just wouldn't seem right if I couldn't take a bite of this crunchy cucumber concoction. I have a whole list of foods in that represent summertime in my mind. Just off of the top of my head: strawberry shortcake, corn on the cob, rhubarb cream pie, fresh green beans with potatoes and bacon, caprese salad, and Kentucky Grilled Chicken are all foods that I look forward to each and every summer.

Many years ago, before marriage and children had blessed our lives and the lives of our many friends, we created a rather large ersatz family. A dozen or more of us twenty-somethings would gather together frequently to share meals, celebrate birthdays, and, usually with the accompaniment of copious amounts of beer, mark the passage of time while enjoying each others' company.

By most measures, we spend about a third of our time daydreaming, yet our brain is unusually active during these seemingly idle moments.

Moreover, it appears to be the only time these areas work in unison.

When we read Proverbs 31, we need to remember to jump ahead to the New Testament. Jesus - not a list of rules – makes a woman into a Proverbs 31 woman. He takes a controlling woman and teaches her to put others before themselves. He indwells the lazy woman and provides her with purpose and perseverance. He gives her the mind of Christ and instills wisdom in her over time. He breathes warmth into her cold heart and helps her become compassionate. He gives her strength in her weakness. He gives her dignity in her shame. The real Proverbs 31 woman is simply a Jesus woman.

The first thing I did was take off all the doors, glass inserts, drawers, and hardware. That took a surprisingly long time because there were at least 100 screws holding everything together, including magnetic door closure mechanisms, etc. Then, I gave everything a rough sanding with fine grit sandpaper. The goal wasn't to remove all of the finish, but just to rough up the surfaces so that the primer would adhere well.

I remember at the beginning of the 2011 season, Jack asked me if I thought you would break the save record in 2011. I told him that I thought it would probably take two years, perhaps early in the 2012 season. But you had another remarkable year and by the end of August it was becoming clear that you would break the record this year. On August 29, Jack and I went to Baltimore to watch the Yankees play the Orioles. The Yankees won 3-2, and you got the save. Jack wore his Mariano Rivera shirt that night, and we basked in the Yankees victory and the opportunity to witness history as you closed in on the record. After the game, Jack and I talked about what a remarkable player you are—not just in terms of talent and what you have accomplished on the field—but also in terms of how you play the game. We talked about your interviews, and how you always acknowledge God and your teammates. You are a picture of humility in a profession that often promotes just the opposite. I thank you for that.

Housing prices have been out of line in certain markets (L.A., Vegas, Phoenix, south Florida) for a long time. C'mon; if you're paying $1MM for a 1000 square foot home on a zero lot and think that you're making a good investment, you're an idiot. Add in that you entered into that mortgage with no money down and took an ARM loan that states pretty clearly that your interest rate could rise as much as 2% per year...you're now just gambling. It didn't matter when this correction happened, you were going to have a significant number of same said idiots that were going to get burned.

This means a lot of people I know are thinking about New Year resolutions, meaning they’re going to try to achieve a goal during the next year, or are going to change a habit or give up smoking or whatever. In all honesty this can be done at any time of the year, but I suppose it seems more significant to do it at the beginning of the new year, to start over (although it would almost make more sense for Americans at least to start over on the first day of spring, because that seems to be more symbolic of renewal and starting over, at least more so than January 1st, in the dead of winter). Really, I can’t knock this tradition too much, because I’m getting sucked in by the calendar and have a couple resolutions myself, resolutions that I hopefully don’t give up on too early:

In a weird way, the facts that I’m going to miss this place and that I’m sad/feel weird about leaving here make me happy. Those are things that I hoped I’d feel when I started out – because it seemed to me that those would be signs that the semester was worth it. Signs that I had had an excellent time. They are also things that I didn’t feel right away and got upset with myself for not feeling. I have some perspective now and a new way of thought and I don’t get caught up in not feeling how I should feel because maybe there isn’t a right way to feel. And maybe the people who tell me that there IS a right way to feel are wrong. But whatever’s right and whatever’s wrong, this is how I feel and this is what I know: I’m completely conflicted.

3. Write when you would normally write – If you’ve been writing for a long time, then you will probably not even think about when you write, it’s just something you do. Keep it that way! Don’t fall into the trap of thinking you should be doing it every day if you don’t want to. Some people need breathers in between writing sessions, while they think up the next scene. Similarly if you can’t stay awake late but are fresh as a daisy in the morning then follow your instinct. We have to be careful not to let laziness creep in when using words like `write when you feel like it’.
My daughter is constantly losing her bows, and if you have purchased them before, you know they are not cheap! I am always trying to keep track of all of her hair accessories, because the last thing I want to do is have to replace them. So, on my search to find a bow holder that she could actually use, I found super expensive ones, but were flimsy and didn't match her room. She was very specific in what she wanted, and the boutiques were charging upwards of $25 to $45 per holder. So I figured...why not just make one myself!

Thankfully, one does not have to be an Audi race car driver to experience technology derived from racing.

And with this new technology Audi has ventured into with its racing program, we can only imagine what the technology of a TDI AWD Quattro system will transfer like from track to street.

The AG smelling the 2-year anniversary coming up too and the coalition need legitimate things to celebrate…because how it go look that since The Keith bring that Motion of No Confidence that they in a constant tailspin….credit cards, Cheryl Miller, police brutality, escalating murder rate, crimes against women and children, 21st century non-policing, Vidwattie….Vidwattie….Anand hiring his nephew….Marlene Coudray….Vidwattie…Devant hiring Dookeran cousin….Jack winning internal elections….Vidwattie…Kamla carrying her nephew and niece to India and possibly the public paid for that too….nationwide protests in villages….Vidwattie…..TCL strike…..did I mention Kamla’s sister Vidwattie Newton having access to public funds without being an employee of the state?
I defy anyone to look at a fallen fig like this: its heart shape and juice spilled like blood across the stone and not think Gothic thoughts... There's something very sensuous about figs, with their blatant sexual connotations, and the sweet, blowsy scent as they grow on the branch. Others lie on the grass under the tree, newly split open on impact and ripe for destruction by thirsty insects.

I spoke to a woman yesterday whose teenage daughter attempted suicide this past year... had her sense of worth cut down so severely by bullies that she was driven to a desire to end her own life. Beautiful girl with a gentle spirit. Any action that intentionally attempts to bring another soul to despair is wicked.

When we begin learning to see and hear Christ in our brothers and sisters, then real transformation (discipleship) will flow. Let’s get this straight. The image of God is Christ (Col. 1:15). This Christ is corporate. He is the Head and the Body (I Cor. 12:12). He is the Vine and the Branches (John 15:5). He is the Bridegroom and the Bride (John 3:29, 20). He is the foundation and the stones of the house (I Pet. 2:4-7). This corporate Christ is the perfect visible image of the invisible Godhead. We are being transformed into that image from one degree of glory to another!
The following year, he was Harry Jones (more commonly known as Indiana Jones). We found the leather jacket at a garage sale, and the rest was history.
For awhile I really thought Savage Worlds would be "it". It is a solid system and initially had a lot of enthusiasm going for it. While it is still going strong, it seems to have fallen away from the spotlight. Material is still being produced but without much of the fanfare as in the past. Maybe this has something to do with the fact not many products actually hit the shelves; most is print-on-demand or pdfs. Thus if you aren't looking for them specifically, you will not know they are out there.

The prosecutor’s motivation for doing that was never revealed to me. Even though I grew up and ended up working at the sheriff’s office at the courthouse (oh the irony for someone with my family background), I never got to meet him. Whatever the reason for blessing our family that year, he truly was a blessing, giving us three little girls such extravagant gifts.
Racism, sexism, homophobia, anti-elitism — these are but one aspect of the issue. I mentioned decency earlier, and I believe that’s the common delusion about southern hospitality. It’s not unconditional; you get it unless and until who you are is something different from what they (the majority) have deemed “normal,” and therefore acceptable.
A woman in our congregation, who happens to be an artist, did a painting during one of the songs. The painting was related to a scripture from Revelation 22 1:7. This scripture refers to the river of life and the tree of life.

I also found the square silver one at an estate sale. I want to put one of my Paris prints in the small frame, but right now it’s resting there until I trim it. Both frames have nice detail work which adds some interest.
Designed for maximum practicality for daily commuting, the Z.E. seats five in comfort, without any reduction in the cabin space as compared to the standard Fluence. It does this by simply integrating the battery pack to the boot area of the car. Although this is no contender in the luxury segment, the interior are adequately plush, with a nicely bolstered leather rear bench and even air-conditioning outlets for the rear occupants.

According to what I read in the study helps, it would either be unusual to see a man carrying water, as this was normally woman's work, or else this man was likely a servant. He could have been given some extra tasks since it was likely his master was setting up a room to rent out to travelers who would be seeking a place to celebrate the Passover. Not only does Jesus speak prophetically here, but He once again uses humble and unlikely people to accomplish His purposes. In our attempts to serve the Lord we may look for certain physical requirements to think somebody or something can lead us into God's plan. Maybe we would never expect God would use the cashier at check out to give us a word of encouragement for the day. Maybe we are surprised that God would speak to us through reading Bible stories to our children. Maybe we think someone is either too important or too lost to benefit from our attempts to share the Good News of Jesus. Maybe we would rather work with a different age group in Sunday school who we think are more worthy of our instruction.

﻿ THAT'S RIGHT! About a week ago, an Etsy Admin member contacted me about a possible feature on the Huffington Post's Valentine's Day Gifts for Men, from Etsy guide. I kind of half believed it was a hoax, but seeing as how they didn't ask me for my social security number and weren't claiming to be one of my long lost cousins from Nigeria (which wouldn't really have worked on me, seeing as how I've actually spent time with good amount of my family in Nigeria) I responded to the email and provided the information they ask for, and told myself that nothing would come of it. I'm a pessimist in that way, tragic I know.

After an especially long and tiring uphill I came upon a little temple right on top. Temples are good places to put up since they generally have water and walls. This one had neither. While I was chewing on a bun, contemplating staying there anyway since it did have a good view and clean stone slabs, I saw this man get off his scooter and watch the sun set. He’d not stopped to pee or something, actually just watch the sun set over the town sprawling in an arc below us, hugging the sea. I promptly went over and struck up a conversation. As I’d expected, he lived in the town that we were looking down upon (literally for now, but soon, metaphorically as well) and was just heading home. So far so good. Now if I could only get an invitation out of him. Are there places to stay there? Like maybe schools or post-offices, I asked him, what’s the beach like? No no, he said, this is not a good place, it’s a fishing town with all sorts of people, not safe at all; you better head for Karwar. And that was that.

There are those moments that we doubt, the moments when we are low, our self-esteem is low, our moods are low and we lose our confidence of who we are in Christ and who Christ is. Yes, it happens and happens often. He knows and understands because He was tempted as we have been; He was tested as you are.
I was kind of disappointed that the ex didn’t text. We spent three years together. Last year I was graduating and he bought my pearls and we went and spent the weekend alone at my parent’s cabin and went to Rock City Gardens. It was probably my best birthday ever. And this year, nothing. I know he remembered it was my birthday. He remembers numbers like nobody else- like will remember a social after seeing it once and it’s committed to memory.
Sometimes, I don’t live up to my potential. I fall down, as the imperfect being that I am. I stumble and give way to the instinctual “flight or fight” responses that every living, sentient species has within them. I can be angry, and depressed, and occasionally petty or small-minded.
The language is highly descriptive in a sensual way – surroundings, weather and locations are described with lavish, poetic vigour in Humbert’s long-winded manor. The vastness of America is also captured as Humbert describes the hundreds of locations he and Lolita visit in their long, sordid road trips.
I’ve been quite keen on the previous two trailers, but Warner’s reveal this week of the third trailer for The Dark Knight Rises has not excited me as much as the previous two. Potentially this is due to the major street combat scenes that are given a fair chunk of time in the trailer.
This was the picture in front of our house a week ago. The storm had passed and Sunday morning presented us with a bright blue sky. The sun glistened off the ice on the trees and the new-fallen snow was clean and white. We don’t often get a scene like this in Tennessee, so it certainly qualifies as scenic to us.

My evangelism M.O. has been – since the bullhorns of yesterday have deafened the spiritual ears of those who need to consider their eternal destinations – to befriend people and live my life in a way that they’ll see my Christian integrity and care for them so that when they have questions they’ll come to me to direct them to the Answer. In our church plant we regularly did the random acts of kindness things like giving out pop at traffic lights and mowing lawns for neighbors. We had great results.

Still, there's just no getting around the fact that I found long stretches of Habibi downright unpleasant, and there are parts that are nearly impossible to fathom, such as the mad man who clings to a sunny disposition on life, which would be fine were he not convinced that the objects he pulls out of a sewage-choked river are treasures.
In response to questions from Sen.

I've always wondered about this. Why do people blog? What are your motivations for starting and maintaining a blog? There are many different reasons why people choose to blog. Commercial? Professional? Passion for a subject that you want to share with other like-minded people? If I look at my first blog post I wanted this blog to be a series of observations and opinions about a number of topics, particularly life as a law student. A means of getting things off my mind...Now, nothing much has changed. Though, I have tried to steer the blog away from angsty posts about pining for a guy called Leo and now just moan about my lack of a legal job!
So I got into Toronto around 10PM at the Strathacona hotel. Lovely hotel. Kind of one of the classic old style hotels in downtown that everybody likes so much. Those hotels are like the best place for a tourist visit to a new city, yet it's cheap enough for a one night stand.

I own an end grain cutting board set in a check pattern that is as much a part of my wife’s decorating scheme as a useful part of my kitchen. Granted, some cutting boards are pretty plain looking, but even these can quickly become a beautiful part of your kitchen that you will not hide away like other cutting boards.
Notice that, insofar as I know, earthquakes don't benefit from their destruction, nor do tornadoes or floods. They just are...with no thought of winning or achieving anything. They aren't motivated by greed or lust or ambition or hunger or fear or acquisition. They occur and then recede, they don't look around to see their results and repeat themselves if they aren't satisfied. "They" aren't a they in the sense of an agent.

Anyway, as winter turned into spring, people started to wonder what was going on with Pride. A reporter from the Western Star contact me, of all people, to inquire about the state of affairs of CB Pride.

Ethnomusicologist Louise Meintjes undertook a fieldwork of sorts when she listened in on the rehearsals, attended the recording sessions and interviewed at length the members of the all-female mbaqanga group Isigqi Sesimanjemanje in the early 1990s. The relationship between those who were hoping to share their talents and reap the rewards from a potential overseas audience and those who had the power to make or break the act is a formidable one, particularly during that particular time period in South Africa. The other major factor was the presence of white engineers in the production of what was regularly termed "black music", or more coarsely, "black stuff". It is these relationships that Meintjes explored in her 2003 book Sound of Africa!: Making Music Zulu in a South African Studio when recounting Isigqi's preparation for their next album release Lomculo Unzima (This music is heavy).

As I said earlier, I haven’t really trusted anyone properly with anything (apart from the exception I told you all of), because I didn’t want to get hurt like I did the times before. I was worried about making this blog public. But then I considered the kinds of lives others blog about and decided that if they could do it, if they could trust other people with information about their thoughts and lives then so could I. Maybe I could trust other people.

I want to leave you this week with a verse Heather shares:
What this episode proves is that sex will never rival football as a spectator sport. People who roar ecstatically when a goal is scored just don’t feel the same elation when they watch strangers copulate. A ball thudding into the back of a net is a far more powerful image than all the cum-shots, cum-faces and cream-pies one could muster in craziest orgy known to pornographic science. Don’t ask me whether that’s a good thing – my job is to observe, not judge.

Much has already been written about Sean Penn’s amazing transformation into Harvey Milk, but I’ve got to admit – it’s all true. There are points when you can completely forget that it’s Penn you’re watching; he embodies the character so completely. Surrounding him are strong performances by James Franco as Milk’s long-suffering boyfriend, Scott Smith, and Emile Hirsch as newly-hatched activist Cleve Jones. (Hirsch is particularly good, though he so strongly resembles Jo Lo Truglio in Wet Hot American Summer that I couldn’t help but giggle at first.) Josh Brolin serves well as Dan White, though it’s nearly an impossible role, particularly with all of the film’s implications that White was a closeted homosexual himself, and Diego Luna flails a bit as Milk’s boy-toy, Jack Lira. No matter – it’s really Penn’s show here, and no one crowds around enough to detract attention.

The next morning I woke up at 4:00 to get ready and head over to the airport. I parked my Toyota Camry in the long term parking and nervously headed to my gate. My good friend SanDee gave me the advice to just follow the signs if I felt like I was getting lost in an airport. I wasn't worried so much about the Boise airport or even the Lexington airport. It was my next TWO stops before Lexington I was worried about: the Denver airport and Chicago O'Hare Airport, the latter being one of the biggest airports in the world. Gahh!! The flight to Chicago was a long one. I sat between two guys and the one by the window kept trying to talk to me. I was exhausted and just wanted to sleep. I ended up going through all of the airports with ease. In Chicago there was a lot of walking, but I found myself loving the fact that I was walking down the same halls the McAllister family walked through in the "Home Alone" movies. My layovers were all at least 2 hours in each airport. It was a long day.

The title of this review was excerpted from a longer passage worthy of inclusion now. Paul Schoemaker observes, “The great virtue of mistakes, whether they occur accidentally or by design, is their ability to enlarge our range of experience, shrink our ego, and thereby increase the chance of discovery. If you accept that humans are myopic and largely unaware of their own bounded rationality, then some degree of mistake-making is appropriate and welcome. This is especially hard in organizations but leaders can start by instituting awards like the Golden Egg.” That is, view mistakes as (potentially) valuable assets, not as “failures.”
Too often names bandied about are the result of reading the back pages and with scant regard to the realities. For example, Eden Hazard is often named but where will he fit in with Podolski, Miyachi, Oxlade-Chamberlain and (possibly although doubtfully) the loanees Arshavin returning and/or Benayoun staying? That is overloading the squad before considering the impact of these signings on competition regulations. Vertonghen’s versatility offers a basis for his purchase but these are just two of the names. I suspect that it will be some time before another signing is made given that there are a significant number of players on loan who must return to the club if their current employers are not minded to make an acceptable offer for their services.

A little more than a year later, I would again put myself in a vulnerable position in front of my chapter. After serving as president for almost 18 months I was getting worn down. There was a lot of frustration and negativity within my chapter - after the last recruitment it had become difficult to communicate with one another, we became to large that sisters were feeling disconnected. The feeling of disconnection was present and apparent, and none of us knew what to do - including me. It was recommended to me by a Panhellenic sister that I write a letter about my experiences to read at our next chapter meeting - I wasn't acting like myself and the negative turn had begun to effect me. As our chapter meeting was coming to a close, I opened the letter and started to read. I got as far as "Dear Sisters," before I began to cry. I was ashamed and embarrassed that I wasn't able to make my sisters as happy as they wanted. I was upset and frustrated that I couldn't solve our problems - at least not alone. The feelings I was about to share made me feel humiliated, as if by admitting them, I had let my sisters down. Then again, as my eyes began to tear up and my voice began to shake, I found myself letter in one hand, and the hand of a sister in the other. And again, the taking of my hand said that it was all alright, that I didn't have to feel any of those things around my sisters, that it was okay that I was upset and that I didn't have to deal with all of this alone. Just as a sister held my hand through the excited time, they too would be there to hold my hand when times were trying and difficult.
-On Wednesday night I was watching a friend's 2 girls, while her and Eric were at a meeting for church...all was going well, we had a snack, we played at the park, we were walking home from the park, Molly takes off running and BAM! Face first into the ground. I was behind her about 10 feet with the stroller, and at first like most moms, I was like "you are fine! Get up!" Oh she got up, turned around and blood everywhere. I mean like Halloween horror film, blood everywhere. I had no idea where all the blood was coming from, plus I had 3 other little girls with me to care for, too. So we start walking home. I had nothing, like not even one tissue with me to give to Molly. Thank the Lord we live 6 houses away from the park, but it was still a painful walk home for Molly. She was bleeding from her mouth, elbow, and knee. There's a nice trail of blood on the sidewalk from her, you are welcome lovely neighbors :)

Heckert – “John is a guy, whether he comes in and starts, we obviously have two really good players playing defensive tackle. Anytime, especially on the defensive line, you need three or four guys that can rotate. We talked about this last year where our defensive line was playing a lot of snaps last year. I don’t know if we want that, necessarily, so now we have a couple extra guys at the end position and now at tackle that we can do a nice rotation.”

On Sunday I spent a lovely day out in the sunshine with Wes...at Goodwood Festival of Speed! Oh yes, I thought that my willingness to accompany my love to such a blokey bore-fest meant that I must be the best girlfriend in the entire world, only to be horrified to find that there were wives and girlfriends absolutely everywhere. And I think some of the women there weren't even wives or girlfriends at all, but had just mosied along of their own accord! Not a bad move if they're single.
“Do you know where this girl lives? I will go straighten her out. Come on, you and me! We’ll show her what it’s like to have someone bullying you.” Yeah, it was me that said it. I was threatening to go shake down a preschooler. I wasn’t really going to.
Immediately, a simple wooden door appeared right in front of me. That seemed rather too easy, but I reached out and opened the door and moved (by intention, not with my feet exactly) through the doorway. Just on the other side, someone was waiting for me. It was a very lovely young native woman with long and straight black hair, dressed in tribal clothing. She was looking at me with a very slight smile, then she motioned for me to come with her.

Amazon this weekend has begun its bid to make very clear to Kindle eBook customers that it had no hand or part to play in the newly introduced agency model now adopted by the five large publishing houses who were instrumental in seeing it as the primary distribution price model.
On the rare occasions that I get polishes early, I try to get them swatched and up as quickly as possible, usually within the same day. I got these last week. Yeah. I had issues with my swatches. Too much reflection (glitters can be a bitch to photograph), too much shadow, poor colour... a polish nightmare. On top of that I can't wrap my head around the names. I usually have a knack for remembering the name to shade connection, but these? I have notes all over the place so I know which photo goes with which polish. All that said, please forgive my awful swatches. This collection just doesn't like me, and to be truthful, I'm not too sure I like it all that much either.

In a mortar, sprinkle garlic cloves with salt and pound with a pestle until smooth. Add malunggay leaves, a large handful at a time, and mash into the garlic, until all leaves are used and a thick paste is formed. Add olive oil and half of the cheese, then mash; add half of the nuts and mash again. Repeat with remaining cheese and nuts, pounding all the ingredients together until well-mixed into a paste. At this point, the pesto may be quite thick and clumpy - just set aside until pasta is cooked.
So what, you ask, does this have to do with a rubber chicken?

"The whole individualist what-you-can-do-to-save-the-earth guilt trip is a myth. We, as individuals, are not creating the crises, and we can't solve them. Take our crazy energy consumption. For the past 15 years the story has been the same every year: individual consumption--residential, by private car, and so on--is never more than about a quarter of all consumption; the vast majority is commercial, industrial, corporate, by agribusiness and government. So, even if we all took up cycling and wood stoves it would have a negligible impact on energy use,global warming and atmospheric pollution. I mean, sure, go ahead and live a responsible environmental life; recycle, compost, ride a push-bike; but do it because it is the right, moral thing to do--not because it's going to save the planet.

The Fatal Shore: The Epic Of Australia's Founding by Robert Hughes
After the first application of Roundup, maybe 90% of all the pigweed is gone. This still leaves about 10,000 individuals who were exposed to the herbicide but had slight genetic differences that allowed them to survive. In order for those genetic adaptations to be passed on they must show up in the sex cells of the individual. Assuming even that only half of the 10,000 have genetic advantage that can be passed on, that's still 5,000 individuals who survived with the advantage that can be passed on. A very VERY conservative estimate for plant species is a doubling of viable population. This original generation of plants that survived to reproduce is called the "parent" generation in genetics.

Some friends have arrived from Canada recently, and I have been showing them the ropes. Since this is my third time here, I have given some training to a few newbies. I find it funny how people will not believe you when they ask a question on how to do something, you give the answer on how it is, and they don´t believe you and say "But in 'fill in the blank here with the appropriate 1st world country' you can do it this way." and then I say "This isn´t 'fill in the blank here with the appropriate 1st world country' this is Argentina. Welcome to Argentina my friend!
I've been a fan of Barley Creek brewpub in the Poconos, often in the face of negative reviews. Well, hell, folks, most of the negative reviews were about the food or service, and I've never had a problem. The food changed, but that's just evolution. The beer? Honestly, the last time I was in, I liked the beer just fine...but that was over two years ago. So when owner Trip Ruvane invited me to stop in and meet his new brewer, Joe Percoco, I thought it was, well, you know...my duty to drive up to the Poconos and spend an hour tasting new beers. Heavy burden and all, right?

But he struggled for winners over the next two years before a more productive 2004/05 campaign persuaded Lynch to turn professional at the end of July, 2005. He recorded a first Grade One success when scoring on the Jim Dreaper-trained Notre Pere in the Knight Frank Ganly Walters Novice Chase at Leopardstown in December, 2007. He posted a first big-race success in Britain in March, 2006, when he partnered the Ado McGuinness-trained Victram to success in the Imperial Cup at Sandown and he was also on board Notre Pere when he triumphed in the 2008 Welsh National at Chepstow. Lynch has enjoyed a pair of wins at the Cheltenham Festival in both 2010 and 2011, including the superb victories of Sizing Europe in the Arkle Trophy Chase and the sportingbet.com Queen Mother Champion Chase. Lynch is also bidding to complete a notable Derby-Grand National double, having won the amateur Derby on Tender Falcon at Epsom Downs in August, 2004.

A lot of us are reeling from the recent Supreme Court decision to allow corporations unrestricted influence on our political elections. Reeling not from surprise, but from our single-malt coping mechanisms. We’re really not that surprised. Corporations already run things. Those of us blessed with intelligence and cursed with shreds of conscience have seen this, and bemoaned this, and have, as a result, been putting generous doses of scotch in our morning coffee for years. But to paraphrase Lilly Tomlin, no matter how cynical I become, I just can’t keep up.

Each morning I drive to work, I pack a bag: clothing, rain coat, work out clothing, a hairbrush, extra shoes, a book, some toiletries, and make-up. Each morning, I wonder if the car will start. Each day after my shift, I wonder even more, if I will be able to drive it home. I feel like one of Louisa May Alcott’s character’s from Little House on the Prairie. I ready my belongings for the journey to town, complete with a shopping list (musn’t forget the groceries or I shall surely starve otherwise! Thank heavens the summer is coming, I shall be able to plant the crops again.), good and sturdy walking boots, food for the horses, and I mentally note all the errands that need to be run (perhaps I’ll buy some ribbons for mother and yarn for sister). For you see, once parked in town, Herbert cannot be driven for another hour. I park at my last destination, and venture into town to run my errands. I make up things to do to pass and hour’s worth of time. To be safe, I usually stay away from the ignition for an hour and a half.
To my knowledge no one has any actual, undisputed playbook which unequivocally states how life began, when life begins, whether it was all a big bang, or a big bust of a paradisaical garden called Eden…. Whether humans created god, or a god created humans… If and why a god created good berries, poison berries, the stock market, mosquitoes, the Grand Canyon, terrorists, HIV, nuclear warheads, herpes, aspirin, happiness… If free will is what god determined as a way to test us on earth, or a convenient way to give a pass to bad things that happen in the world, or just verbal hubbub that people like to spew as why people do bad things…

The Knicks will go up against the Boston Celtics. This is a bit of a crossroads season for the Celtics. Their window of opportunity is closing rapidly and this will most likely be their last season to compete for anything substantial. The Celtics big three is aging fast as Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, and Kevin Garnett are all in their mid thirties and there does not seem to be a crop of young Celtics waiting in the wings to take over. Their best young assets are Rajon Rondo and Jeff Green. Green is dealing with a heart condition which has ended his 2011-2012 season and the team attempted to trade Rondo in an attempt to acquire Chris Paul.

They asked Nzvere why he had shared all these treasures with his sons only. They said, “This is our treasure which was left by our fathers. Why have you forgotten us?” They told Nzvere to take back all the treasure which he had given to his sons. Nzvere told his sons to bring back all the treasure. They brought all the treasures and the women. Madzivanyika, Charumbira, Chingoma, Mafusire, Nyava, Madzima and shared these treasures with the sons of Nzvere.

I would have given anything to see the modern buildings again. Anything recognisable. The city beside the river lay degraded and twisted, ruined.

So at least two contemporary Jewish extra Biblical sources confirm that Jews use “day and night” as an idiomatic expression of a “day unit” including any part of a day or night. Additionally, the book of Esther uses specifically “three days and three nights” as a non 72-hour period of time (see Esther 4:15-16 & 5:1; 5:4-6; also cf. Gen. 42:17-18 “after three days” = “on the third day”).

Meanwhile, suspicions persist about Kweku Adoboli’s real role in a UBS ‘rogue’ trading episode, especially considering the general opinion that the Swiss bank was already faltering badly. These may be overtaken about fears for the institution itself in the coming days. Said an insider yesterday, “This is the very last thing we needed or wanted. Our people have been through enough.” The FT felt that the discovery of fraud ‘could rip through the bank’s fragile customer base, dealing a another heavy blow to a group whose reputation among corporate and private banking clients had only just begun to recover’. But others remain sceptical about whether Adoboli really acted alone:

This is somewhat similar to the hippie parenting of the 60’s. You remember that child who grew up on a commune, which often doubled as a nudist colony? He ran around dirty and naked suckling on whichever breast was jammed in his face, but damn it, he was happy. He also later became a voting member of the Green Party. Gayby Group Parenting is like this in its free thinking, but different in that it involves more clothes and usually only 4 breasts and 2-4 balls.

I've fought being a romance author. Silly, isn't it? Romance book sell far more than any other paperback or ebook out there, and they're so fun to write. So why do, I find myself pausing when it comes time for me to say I write romance. Why? What's wrong with romance? Over the summer I had a book signing in San Diego at a writing conference. When a woman came up to my table and and with a smile asked me what romance author inspired me to write my book. Though my novel is considered a romance, the authors that popped into my head weren't romance writers. I thought of my two current favorites, King and JA Jance.
I'm here to tell you that an image colored with copics can survive a half a bottle of diamond glaze being dumped all over the image. Miss Brilliant here had just opened a new bottle, clipped the spout open and thought I had put the top cap back on. So when I twisted the cap to remove it, it was actually the bottom cap I twisted off and proceeded to fill not only her glasses, but the entire image with diamond glaze! After a few choice words, a baby wipe cleaned her right up...well at least to the point, I didn't have to start all over.

Several times a year I'm completely consumed by a book this way. Nothing exists but me, the characters and their world.

Take a moment to write down some of the beliefs you have about reality. What do you believe to be true about your health, career, relationships, finances, spirituality, etc? Then go over the eight criteria above to see how they measure up. If you don’t like what you see, craft more effective beliefs to replace the old ones. Remember that your beliefs are not mere observations of reality — they shape and create your reality as well. Many of the thoughts you hold most sacred may reveal their hidden falsehoods once you take the opportunity to test one or two alternatives.
