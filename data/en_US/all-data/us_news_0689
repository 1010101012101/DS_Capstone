Secretary of the Interio rKen Salazar has pulled off the near impossible: At a time when the known gas and oil reserves of the United Stateson public lands have soared, he has cut back on federal leasing of them to just about 2 percent of available offshore lands and 6 percent of onshore. Meanwhile, huge new amounts of oil are now found on private lands despite, not because of, the Interior Department. When he was a U.S. senator, Salazar claimed that even $10-a-gallon gas would not change his mind about voting to increase offshore drilling. And although he controls the leases of the richest oil and gas reserves in the Western world, he just recently shrugged that no one knew whether gas would hit$9a gallon.

Has good length and should have no issues getting his shot off at the NBA level. Vesely is an explosive athlete and very smooth running the court. On defense, he needs to have strong defenders around him for protection. Vesely could still play overseas another season or two and come over and make an impact right away.

The Watchdog reported in a March 16, 2011, article that Anderson was one of the 20th highest paid public officials in the state in 2009. What they failed to report was that out of the 20 employees identified, seven, including Anderson, are administrators of district and public hospitals. Hospital administrators are compensated for the expertise they provide in overseeing highly complex major medical institutions and all of the financial, legal, compliance and regulatory issues they are responsible for managing. There are some 55 federal, state and local agencies they are ultimately responsible to, reporting to or taking oversight from. Ultimately, they are responsible for human lives and patient outcomes. While these CEOs are employed by districts, their responsibilities are commensurate with those of private and not-for-profit hospitals. In fact, the truth is that Anderson is the lowest paid, not the highest paid, of the CEOs of the large district hospitals in the state. His peers at Palomar Pomerado Health System, Salinas Valley Memorial Health, Washington Township, Kaweah Delta Health System, Marin Health, and Antelope Valley Hospital all make more than Anderson in both base pay and benefits. Additionally, all of these compensation packages were determined by publicly elected boards exercising their duties of care, loyalty and obedience to their constituents, communities and patients.

Brady: I certainly think the city has a role in providing bridge financing for cultural institutions. The city provides that or you get started on finding private partners that can do that. The arts are not run by the city but they're city assets, like libraries. They're that revered and significant and there's a public responsibility. There are all sorts of terms to put together for that situation. One thing you'll get with me as mayor is a real focus on financing and capitalization of our large institutions and small programs. I'm not an artist myself but I'm a believer that arts education has to be a top priority. Where my expertise is the financing part of the equation. How do we create a stable financial situation? How do we get stable public-private financing?
Both Deion and Pilar Sanders already face simple assault charges, also misdemeanors.
It's true that Ms. Rawlings-Blake's bottle tax would not be a comprehensive solution to the city schools' facilities crisis. But it could be an important start in the effort to amass the cash flow that will be necessary to support hundreds of millions, and perhaps billions, of dollars in bond issues for school construction and renovation. By itself, the measure would contribute $10 million a year, and in combination with a re-dedication of $12 million in other school funds plus 10 percent of the city's proceeds from its as-yet unbuilt casino, the mayor estimates she could support $300 million in borrowing. Put another way, the bottle tax, by itself, could be enough to build 10 new elementary schools.

The first of more-rigorous audits ordered by Ryan was performed at Kingman in November 2010, three months after MTC's public promise to tackle security flaws. MTC had installed new alarms, but they weren't working properly and went off so often that staff ignored them, auditors said. Problems with security lights and the control panels continued.

Doors were left unsecured and unmonitored; searches still weren't being conducted properly.

Intellectuals are often the last to learn things, so John Kenneth Galbraith, Harvard's celebrity economist and one of liberalism's pinups in the 1950s and 1960s, argued in his 1958 book "The Affluent Society" that modern marketing -- advertising and other supposedly dark arts -- is so powerful that big corporations could manufacture demand for whatever they manufactured. In 1958, Ford put all its marketing muscle behind the Edsel.

"I really understand I'll never be up here again. I really want to think all my colleagues, my friends. I look out here and I see my life before my eyes, my old friends, my new friends. Really, this is such a great honor but the think that counts the most with me is the friendship and the love and the sheer job we've shared making moves together."
The left despised President George W. Bush for his intransigent allegiance to certain ideologies (supply-side economics, evangelical Christianity, neoconservative foreign policy), an allegiance that compelled him to take controversial, stubborn, sometimes disastrous policy positions. To paraphrase Stephen Colbert, "W" was not one to let facts undermine his convictions. Early on, Mr. Obama's pragmatism seemed a refreshing change from all that. The Democrats don't find the president's brand of pragmatism refreshing anymore. Consider the mounting indignities.
Myers, who was hired as Colorado Springs chief in 2007, was lauded by Pete Tomitsch, past president of the Colorado Springs Police Protective Association, for improving trust between police administration and rank-and-file officers.

For dessert, order the house-made cannoli, if only because it's crammed with dark chocolate bits. Servers, though accommodating, try too hard to please. No need to rush back to the table to ask about each dish. This chef gets it. -- David Farkas, Special to The Plain Dealer

With any meat, you get a sauceboat of chimichurri sauce, basically roughly cut parsley, garlic, olive oil and lemon — and highly addictive. On request, they'll bring you one generously spiked with hot red peppers. You also get home-style mashed potatoes colored with a little pumpkin to give them a pale orange-gold tinge. For me, they're a little pasty. The carrots and broccoli aren't particularly inspiring either.

Why he’s not a first-rounder: Actually, Hill could go in the first round. The 49ers might have an eye on him at No. 30. The Jaguars won’t take Hill at No. 7, but if they trade down, Hill could be a target. If Hill doesn’t go in the first round, it’s because his skills are raw, and he only caught 28 passes last season. It may take him a year or two to feel comfortable in the NFL.

There are plenty of shows for family audiences to enjoy together. Stage versions of fairy tales are always welcome, from "Puss 'N' Boots" (Piwacket) and "Jack and the Beanstalk" (Piwacket) to "Sleeping Beauty" (COCA) to an African version of Cinderella, "Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters" (COCA). "Alice in Wonderland" (COCA) has marvelous adventures in a magic place, but the "Tomato Plant Girl" (Metro Theater Company) finds magic in everyday life. Of course, children are interested in families - and families can take all kinds of shapes. Just consider the multicultural "Portrait of My People" (Avalon Theatre).

10. Cool hotels. Not long ago, your choices were spartan hotels, staid business hotels or plush and pricey inns in historic buildings. Over the past decade, the DF has spawned a raft of hip boutique hotels and a wave of much-imitated stylish hostelries. Hotel Hábita in Polanco set the trend, converting a 1950s apartment building into 36 elegantly modern rooms wrapped in a glass envelope more reminiscent of a spa than a hotel. Within the walls of a 1928 mansion, retro-chic Condesa DF sports flat-screen TVs, DVDs, iPods and a rooftop terrace with views of Chapultapec Castle. The W Mexico City is Latin America's only W hotel, skewing more passionate and youthful than its sister properties, with spare lines, bold Kahlo-Rivera colors, native Mexican materials, hammocks in beer-hall-sized bathrooms, a seductive terrace with fireplaces and a temazcal (pre-Hispanic adobe sweat lodge).

Landolfi deals mostly with glioblastomas. It’s a cancer of the glial (gluey), or supportive, tissue of the brain and is the most frequently diagnosed form of brain cancer. It is also the deadliest.

Mr. Obama has also sometimes failed to project resolve, despite his strong decision-making on the war. His policies have been firmer than his words. In announcing his decision to increase troops a second time at West Point on Dec. 1, 2009, Mr. Obama also pledged to begin removing U.S. forces from Afghanistan by July 2011. By itself, a plan to make any additional foreign military buildup in Afghanistan temporary should not have raised too many eyebrows; after all, President George W. Bush did much the same thing with the surge in Iraq. But Mr. Obama seemed to be promising a fairly rapid end to the war overall — and that seemed to be the message he wanted Congress and the American people, especially the anti-war base of his own party, to hear. Well aware of the nation's war fatigue, well aware of the analogies drawn between his war effort in Afghanistan and Lyndon Johnson's in Vietnam, Mr. Obama tried to have it all: being muscular enough to create a chance to succeed while hedging his bets and trying to keep the country's political left supportive at the same time. He took a similar approach last June, in announcing a faster initial troop drawdown than Gen. David Petraeus had favored. This somewhat mixed effort, even if useful for handling domestic criticism of the war at home, has probably contributed unhelpfully to hedging behavior among many Afghans and Pakistanis.

Portland interim head coach Kaleb Canales has said on multiple occasions since taking reigns of the team he wants the Trail Blazers' identity to be on the defensive end. Asked Monday after practice about the Blazers' 90-87 win over Golden State the night before -- in which Portland held its ground on the final play in a come-from-behind win over the Warriors -- Canales said that's exactly how he prefers to win a game: on a defensive possession rather than an offensive possession.

Hey, Tony: If Peyton Hillis truly is allowed to walk, do you see the Browns making a run at Michael Bush similar to the Falcons with Michael Turner? I believe he is a free agent after this season and normally I don't agree with spending in free agency, but he's a proven threat and would allow us to focus our draft on WR and OL. Thoughts? -- Vince Ross, Fort Myers, Fla.

MSU doesn't crack Winn's top 16, but he gives an explanation for the Spartans (whom he has 18th). "While Draymond Green will be the most-missed player in the country next season -- I don't have Michigan State in the top 16 because I think his do-everything game and leadership skills will be so hard to replace that it'll create a UConn post-Kemba Walker type of situation -- Memphis' Will Barton could be a close second."

Meanwhile, those of us who envision a future with more local food production, more job opportunities and economic development through sustainable farming, healthier school lunches and cleaner water and air should make our priorities known to the supercommittee.

These calls for service are answered by highly trained men and women who are prepared to sacrifice themselves for members of our community they have never met. While it is true there have been some highly publicized missteps, the overwhelming majority of these people are honest, hardworking and extremely dedicated to what they do, the community they serve, and to doing the right thing. These people have also been distressed. Major mergers, significant shifts in strategies, staffing shortages, funding shortfalls, ill-conceived experiments and even a reported lack of toilet paper do not constitute a happy or productive workforce. These organizations are not at all opposed to change, but they are opposed to change that produces unfair outcomes, diminishes safety and demeans others, as has been the case in recent years.

What a way for both trends to end.
Californians pay some of the highest personal income taxes, sales taxes and car taxes in the nation. But following Brown's lead, most news organizations routinely focus on extending taxes as a solution to the current shortfall, Kobylt says, not as the plague upon the middle class that he sees. "Why isn't our top tax rate a boilerplate part of every story?" Kobylt wonders.
"Obviously, we have a lot of work yet to do," Susan Castillo, state superintendent of schools, said Wednesday.

Yet it matters that pension payouts be open to public scrutiny  especially during tough economic times.

Waterbar is expensive, but the restaurant defies the idea that you can't get great views and terrific food under one roof. With a handsome dining room featuring two floor-to-ceiling fish tanks and windows overlooking the Bay Bridge, there's something aquatic to look at no matter where you sit. The menu is a la carte, but here's a real bargain: Each night chef Parke Ulrich prepares a four-course, fixed-price menu ($55). It might start with a salad, followed by seared prawns and risotto, pan-roasted petrale sole with duck confit ravioli, and citrus cheesecake. The food is always creative, and Emily Luchetti's desserts make you want to skip to the end of the menu.

Many Asian elderly immigrants heavily rely on in-home services or on care provided by their children, Phillips said. Those communities place a high value on family and hold a stigma against putting elderly people in nursing homes, she said.

But in only 44% of such cases did the doctor make a formal diagnosis of major depression or anxiety disorder. A visit to a medical specialist who was not a psychiatrist (say, a cardiologist or an endocrinologist) was less likely to result in an antidepressant prescription (3.6% of visits did so). But these specialists were even less likely than were primary care doctors to diagnose a mental disorder justifying the prescription (they did so in only 12.8% of such visits), the study showed.
