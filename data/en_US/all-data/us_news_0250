Exactly the sort of earnest work George C. Wolfe satirized as a "mama on the couch play" in "The Colored Museum," Lee's drama studies post-World War II African-Americans trying to forge a better future while struggling with their long heritage of suffering and exploitation.

Among Mr. Gingrich's failings as a politician is his fascination with "big ideas," an obsession that tends to lead him hither and thither into unproductive policy debates (see moon colonies). Among his successes as a politician is nonetheless his ability—when he lands on a policy issue that matters—to develop it, frame it, and use it to great purpose.
For now, both goals are hampered by a lack of funding. Mataric says take-home Bandits could be a reality within five years if a venture capitalist would step up, but so far she isn't exactly swamped with offers.

I grew up around kit airplanes. Chris Heintz, my father, has had his own kit manufacturing business in Canada since 1972. Educated as an aeronautical engineer, he designed and built his own plane in the early 1970s, handcrafting each part himself. Interest grew in what he had created, and people began purchasing the blueprints, and then began asking him to make parts. His business was one of the earliest full kit manufacturing businesses. We license the designs from him.

It was written for the tall, slim and sexy Mattila and her big, steely voice, and it's hard to imagine anyone else performing it; the stage persona and Mattila's expressive, charismatic physical side are as much a part of the performance as the vocalism and delivery. Even her dress -- a slim black creation with diagonal lines of sequins -- and shawl were a part of the performance: the soprano started chastely covered and then gradually revealed more as the music did, giving the shawl a workout.
The iPhone 4 is sleeker and more advanced than the original iPhone that came out in 2007. Like the iPhone 3GS, it comes in black or white, though it has a more angular look. Its front and back are covered with glass, and it is rimmed with stainless steel that acts as part of the phone's antenna.

In the third quarter of last year, Wal-Mart reversed nine straight quarters of sales declines at stores open at least a year in its namesake U.S. business. That's an indicator of a retailer's health because it excludes results from stores recently opened or closed. In the fourth quarter, Wal-Mart continued the trend. Still, there's a lot more room for improvement. For the year, the measure rose 0.9 percent compared with a 1.1 percent dip in the previous year.
About 13 percent of PERS benefits paid last year went to retirees who lived out of state. Eliminating the adjustment for those members (actually, just the adjustment on benefits earned before 1995) would not amount to huge savings, but proponents say it's real money and, they say, one of the safest changes for legislators leery of the political fallout from tampering with the system.

Let me start by trying to simplify the matter. It's extremely common for players to win small or lose big when holding big pocket pairs such as AA. Often, after you raise preflop or make a strong bet on the flop, everyone else folds, and you earn a small victory. Other times, you get connected to your aces and stay in all the way, only to run into two pair or better.

In their quest for perfection, some winemakers are now searching beyond the parameters of the origins and seasoning of oak to explore the effects of the shape and volume of the barrel. For example, French barrel maker Taransaud has developed a 2,000-liter, egg-shaped fermentation vessel known as the "Ovum." It was designed using the principles of the golden ratio, which throughout history has been acknowledged as one that is particularly attractive to the human eye. This is where winemaking meets "The Da Vinci Code."

Sometimes, I wonder if some of us really understand what that means. With the L.A. riots now 20 years behind us and the Martin case before us, it is a good time to consider those words afresh, consider them in light of our noble ideals and too-frequent failings, consider them as if it were you, looking for recourse after justice failed you - again.

Obviously I was a co-founder of the company and I have an affiliation there, but it's not the same thing and I try to point this out, it's very different than being on the front lines where you're trying to make product decisions or decide what's going to be in the next version of Windows. It's just, it's very different than that. I'm not on the board anymore, either. Steve Ballmer, I think, has one of the toughest jobs in the world. I talk about it in the book. I call them the Hellhounds. He's fighting against some of the toughest, most aggressive technology companies out there that have a lot of momentum going their way. I certainly encourage Steve and the other guys as best I can.

By raising its severance tax to 5 percent on all natural gas reserves to match the rate in Michigan and West Virginia, Ohio could generate $1.7 billion in new revenue over the next decade, according to a report from the left-leaning think tank Innovation Ohio.

Bush called a war on terror, a heightened concern for a foreign "axis of evil," and eventually the invasion of Iraq and considerable changes in U.S. national security and intelligence policies.

I believe he's headed there if nothing changes. I hear the frustration from fans. I see the season-ticket renewal deadline looming late in the season. And I wonder if the fear that the Blazers will get slammed by a protest of their season-ticket holders will be the reason they decide to start over again.
The only sure thing is that the Coyotes, kept in Phoenix by Commissioner Gary Bettman despite widespread public indifference and Jim Balsillie's lucrative offer to buy and move the team, will be too distracted by the legal fight over their ownership to benefit as much as they should from new Coach Dave Tippett.

But these days, Congress isn't accomplishing much at all, much less in a bipartisan fashion. So with the support of governors of both parties across the country, Mr. Duncan has decided to give states the ability to develop their own accountability standards. He will grant each of them a waiver from meeting the expectations of No Child Left Behind.
As news of a draft list of regional transportation projects worked its way through the 10-county metro Atlanta region, everyone had their own ideas about what should have been on the list.
Campbell said he did not know the driver's injuries.

Reading some of his comments is painful. A 23-year-old should not be feeling that boxed in, not with so many good things happening in his life. He has been given talents that few people possess. If only that were enough for the masses. But of course it isn't. There are obligations that go with those skills. Fans want more of him. Reporters want to talk with him everywhere he goes. If he's not signing this, he's signing that.

Maryland had to beat out just North Carolina State and Northwestern for Logan, but several analysts agreed that the four-star prospect was an under-recruited player – probably because he comes from an area (Boston) with hardly any football recruiting tradition. CBS Sports Network recruiting expert Tom Lemming called Logan “the sleeper of all sleepers. … He’s a linebacker who can run. As a junior, I went to Boston and missed him. I got film on him this fall and really liked him. He can run and he can hit. He’ll probably wind up playing strongside or inside linebacker.” Shurburtt, meanwhile, said that if Logan were from Atlanta, he’d have offers from "most of the SEC and probably all of the ACC.”

For many reasons, the film is rarely exhibited — the most celebrated American showing was of a four-hour version at Radio City Music Hall in 1981. Beyond the commercial challenge of finding an audience for such a lengthy picture, there are the technical demands of screening it. In the final 20 minutes, the screen expands to a curved 85 feet, three times its normal width, and presents either a trio of related images or one enormous, eye-widening panorama. Gance, a cinematic innovator, masterminded this bravura conclusion. He called it Polyvision, and it delivered.

They found that Mr. Buffett referred slightly more positively to Mr. Jain than he did to any other Berkshire manager. However, Tad Montross, CEO of General Re, scored a close second for overall positivity and nudged out Mr. Jain in the proportion of financially positive words Mr. Buffett used. (For example, in his 2002 letter, Mr. Buffett wrote of "enormous progress" under Mr. Montross.) Not far behind were CEOs Brad Kinstler, of See's candy; Greg Abel, of MidAmerican Energy; Don Wurster, of National Indemnity; Mr. Nicely; and Kevin Clayton, of Clayton Homes.

Newman's self-mocking, whimsical humor can be seen in his biography in the Westport program for "Our Town": "Paul Newman is probably best known for his spectacularly successful food conglomerate. In addition to giving the profits to charity he also ran Frank Sinatra out of the spaghetti sauce business. On the downside, the spaghetti sauce is outgrossing his films. He did graduate from Kenyon College magna cum lager and in the process begat a laundry business which was the only student-run enterprise on Main Street. Yale University later awarded him an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters for unknown reasons. He has won four Sports Car of America National Championships and is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest driver (70) to win a professionally sanctioned race (24 hours of Daytona, 1995). He is married to the best actress on the planet, was number 19 on Nixon's enemy list, and purely by accident has done 51 films and four Broadway plays. He is generally considered by professionals to be the worst fisherman on the east coast."

WASHINGTON - The Obama administration on Thursday condemned a suicide attack in Syria's capital that killed 55 people and expressed concern that al-Qaida may be increasingly taking advantage of the country's prolonged instability.
Timothy J. McGinty, 60, is probably the front-runner after decades as a top deputy to Corrigan and a Common Pleas judge. He knows the system intimately and has the drive to make change; he also has a history of being so sure of himself that he alienates potential allies. His decision to invite the current prosecutor's staff to a fundraiser -- albeit as his guests -- shows a blind spot to the need to insulate the office from politics. James J. McDonnell, 55, is a respected defense attorney and former prosecutor who promises to lead by example, even trying tough cases himself. But McDonnell lost us when he said he'd expect his staff to stay out of politics "from 8 to 6." That's just not the impermeable wall this county needs right now.

Well, I would definitely qualify that as a little bit of a problem. The way I see it, you have two options: You can either man-up and learn to love cats because she loves cats. Or, you ask her to get rid of them. And, honestly, I don’t advise you go with option No. 2. It would be different if you were engaged, because you’d be committed to each other for the long run. But what if she got rid of the cats for you and you two broke up? I bet you’d feel worse than she would!

I have no doubt that elected officials go to Washington with great intentions. Yet the effects of fundraising and partisanship have long been clear in our nation's headlines. Rather than politicians who promise support to political parties or to the special interests that help raise campaign cash, we need politicians who focus, as members of the military do, on their allegiance to the U.S. Constitution and the people of this nation.
The gown was one of many Elizabeth Taylor items up for auction at Christie's and Luis is a big fan of the late movie goddess. Elizabeth wore this dress most memorably at the 1984 Golden Globes, when she received the Cecile B. DeMille Award.

If I were king I would declare that the strategic interest of the United States extends to the northern Western Hemisphere and no further.

In addition, under Quarles' tutelage, former Gamecock Chelsea Hammond became the first multi-event student-athlete in South Carolina history to qualify for the Olympic Games. Coached by Quarles from 2002 to 2005, Hammond competed for Jamaica at the 2008 Olympic Games in the long jump. Quarles has coached 10 of the 14 school record holders in the events for which she is responsible at South Carolina.
Also inaccurate is the nursing home staff's assertion that your aunt is not allowed to leave, says Eric Carlson, directing attorney with the Los Angeles office of the National Senior Citizens Law Center.

8. Dick Schafrath, T, 1959, 2/23, Ohio State, 1959-71. Replaced Hall of Famer Lou Groza at left tackle in 1960, after Groza retired after starting at the position since the Browns' inception in 1946. Groza ended his one-year retirement to resume his legendary place-kicking career in 1961. Schafrath made first-team all-pro four times and played in six Pro Bowls. Missed just two games. A strong case can be made that he should be in the Hall of Fame.

Pro-mandate partisans also say that cost-sharing hits poor patients hardest, pointing to a 2010 study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that does indeed show that low-income people would forego preventive care if they were saddled with co-pays.
Ruiz said Superintendent Janine Caffrey, who has since been placed on administrative leave, notified his department several months ago about the alcohol allegations. The chief said the issue was handled internally and there was insufficient evidence for a police investigation.
I've had a repetitive dream where I'm either walking or jogging. But as soon as I begin, I can't keep pace. I don't have the ability to walk properly or put one foot in front of the other. My knees lock and it takes great effort to make each step. I cannot get where I'm going but I never stop trying. Please sort out what this all means. Kim Rodriguez, New York

The first hit of realization came in April 2007, when she got out of yet another weeklong jail stint for a drug bust and went to a meth den to score, she said. Her head clear from being forced to get momentarily clean behind bars, she looked around at all the junkies and thought of her baby son - and the prospect of him living through what his older sister had endured.
On top of that, cost can be an issue.
However, a name is just a name, Frankel said. "The name change alone doesn't mean anything. A brand is about building trust," he said, stressing that consumers will take a "show-me" attitude.

A spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch declined to discuss the developments. Two weeks ago, McCulloch said his office was reviewing the Highway Patrol investigative report,
His Royal Highness made no speech but participated in the planting of a maple tree in celebration of Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee. He obligingly scooped shovelfuls of dirt around the tree and then obligingly pretended to get a stomach cramp from the exertion, which everyone applauded, and you thought: Now I get it. He really is astoundingly good at this royal thing. He really has mastered the art of standing, smiling, nodding, as if he didn't have anything better to do than chat.
But instructors and participants say the ultimate appeal of these classic martial arts disciplines is the ability to engage the entire body in a workout that can't be replicated in a health club.
Baltimore orioles, which winter in Central America, are insect eaters but also feed on wild fruits and sometimes probe flowers for nectar. The flame-orange and black, with a solid black head, of the male makes it very conspicuous as it searches for food. These colors must have caught the attention of early European settlers in Maryland because the bird was named in honor of George Calvert, Lord Baltimore, an early colonizer there, who had chosen orange and black as his family colors. Females are pale orange-yellow and brown.
Sacramento State begins the season at Oregon State on Sept. 3 and plays its home opener Sept. 24 against Montana.
"Didn't they have any other colors?"
He filled his mornings with treatment for his second oblique strain in six months and as many swings as that oblique strain would allow. Even when he played in extended spring games, his day at the ballpark was done by lunch time. That meant killing hours downloading and watching ESPN's "30 in 30" documentaries on Ricky Williams or Len Bias. When he did start his rehab assignment, he expected twice as many at-bats as he got.

Jackson's signing prevented the Browns from having to use the franchise tag on him, keeping it available for another player. Two possible candidates are kicker Phil Dawson or running back Peyton Hillis. It's doubtful the Browns will tag either, but Dawson would probably be the more likely because the franchise number for running backs in 2012 is high -- expected to be about $8 million.
My boyfriend, Peter, and I had arrived in the Atacama after a two-hour flight from Santiago to Calama, an industrial town in a huge copper mining region in the north of Chile. The ride to San Pedro revealed a desolate landscape — why the heck did we come all the way here? — with wide Saharan landscapes interrupted only by mining equipment and workers' houses.

"We have a deep respect for (Lutheran coach) Mike Holtmeier and his program," Whitfield coach Harold Barker said. "We knew today it would be us and them and we already had that penciled into our minds. Being the tournament host, we had more course knowledge and that probably helped us out today."
Earlier this year, Bella was also hospitalized with pneumonia, prompting Santorum to leave the campaign trail before the Florida primary. Santorum frequently mentions his daughter while speaking to voters, thanking them for their prayers and telling supporters how well she is doing.
Arda: This is an unfortunate matchup to me because I don't like either guy as Intercontinental champion. The Big Show and Great Khali seem like a good tag team that should remain a team, especially after dismantling the tag champs Epico and Primo a couple weeks ago on Raw. I think Cody Rhodes has outgrown "secondary title" status and, like Dolph Ziggler, can truly begin his slow-but-steady climb to main-event status. Let's see Show retain and move on, losing the title to someone else soon after.
The average weekly unemployment payout is $393, according to the New Jersey Department of Labor. The trade group’s members process checks for about 60,000 people, McClain said. That translates to $521,118 each week in fees collected by the check cashers.

The last time Chicago won the NFL title, Walter Payton, Jim McMahon and Mike Singletary did the "Super Bowl Shuffle" all over their opponents. That was 25 years ago, and to compare these Bears with the wild bunch that won Chicago's only Super Bowl is a stretch.

Like the Fort Collins brewery, the Asheville facility will be open to the public for tours and tasting.
Flour bills itself as a "rustic Italian kitchen." Yet apart from a few dishes, it's hard to figure out what's so rustic about the place, which opened last year. The menu, design and location strike me, respectively, as polished, sophisticated and urbane. So let that go, and enjoy Flour for what it succeeds at being: a starkly modern eatery (zinc-topped tables, cement floor, gray walls) emphasizing a variety of flavors and textures. The guns are certainly in place to achieve it. The back of the house is helmed by executive chef Chris DiLisi, a Western Culinary Institute graduate who ran the kitchen at the estimable Baricelli Inn before it closed. Baricelli Inn's former owner, chef Paul Minnillo, now owns Flour. Their menu is suffused with brio, which translates to dishes such as caponata-topped bruschetta or lightly battered calamari dressed with basil mayo and scattered with preserved lemon rind. Both are good choices.

Akvany collects about $900 a month in benefits. Her rent and utilities take $800 of that. She and her 8-year-old daughter eat on the other $100, or a little more than $3 a day. Better than South Sudan but not by much.
"Obviously he had no control. He was wobbling. He went upside down and then he headed straight for us, straight at the grandstand."
No. 1 and No. 2 don't easily go together. How can a team that must pay for progress in so many places put so much money into one position? And for a man who has not only spent so much time lately in the company of medical specialists, but turns 36 in two weeks?
KPMG said that even though MetroHealth is not required to use a formal public bidding process under the Ohio Revised Code, the hospital might see better prices by "more systematically" using competition.

I asked Priceline to look into this, and it sent me the same answer: no. It said you were told that only airfare would be refunded. I found this disappointing.

McCain will headline a fund-raising lunch for McSweeney on March 12.
Don't lift too fast. Whether on a machine or with dumbbells, your movements should be slow and controlled, Williford says. "General guidelines say you should take two seconds to raise the weight and two seconds to lower it. This also allows you to make sure you're breathing throughout rather than holding your breath." Lifting slowly also gives you time to concentrate on correct form and technique.

For the second year in a row, Fox Sports Midwest is apologizing for a snafu in its coverage of the pregame festivities at the Cardinals' home opener.
First, I microwave boneless, skinless chicken thighs until cooked through. Microwaving the chicken first means it doesn't need to sit in the oil for nearly as long. Next, I dunk them in egg white, then dredge them through a blend of whole-wheat flour and cornmeal. After that, the frying takes just 12 seconds. Traditional methods call for 10 to 15 minutes.
Needham said the ensuing confusion led to his missing a deadline for submitting a candidate's statement to the Voters' Pamphlet.

Now, as our minivan approached the town's glittering Buddhist temples on a hot April afternoon, I saw sagging pickups shuttling revelers around and blasting bass-heavy Laotian pop music. People danced and shimmied through the streets, throwing colored powder and splashing one another with all types of water weapons. It was a far cry from the image that many Americans no doubt have of Laos, a poor Southeast Asian country ravaged by U.S. bombing during the Vietnam War.
A: That wasn't the idea behind it. The people who have film references, they find something in it, of course. But the idea was to make a crowd-pleaser for all walks of life, to tell a love story, to amuse people, to distract them and to have fun with them because the audience participates even more than in a talkie.
Becky Pruitt-Lukovic, who lives in the Lakes of Hazel Dell subdivision at 126th and Hazel Dell, said last year's race caused problems because both entrances to her neighborhood were shut down.

"But you know, it's something that is going to happen," Roy said. "The good thing about it is, it's not really painful now. A couple of weeks ago, it would linger a little bit longer, whereas now, it just kind of bothers me a little bit. Hopefully, it will be better tomorrow."
A spider web of intensely flavored ham hock emulsion blankets the lentils surrounding a succulent quail ($13). He also encases a fillet of Tai snapper ($25) in a crisp potato crust, neatly arranging it on savory cabbage with silken lobster bacon butter.

As the season comes to a close tonight, I'd say the answer is definitely yes. In its first season, "Portlandia" was finding its way. The show grew out of a series of online videos Armisen and Brownstein made for the fun of it. Now they had a cable channel platform and the big-name support of executive producer Lorne Michaels, Armisen's "Saturday Night Live" boss.

The BCS title game pits the nation's top two teams based on poll and computer rankings.

Referring to the president, Mr. Dorrien wrote: "He helped to inspire, and adeptly responded to, a wave of democratic revolutions in the Arab world."
Of course, in a county that overwhelmingly voted for Barack Obama, its possible that change has come to more than just politics: Attitudes about identity have shifted, and L.A. bands are borrowing and sampling elements from all over the city, often in the same song. The bottom line is that music belongs to every­one once again. The result is what Mitchell Frank, the owner of club Spaceland, describes as indie roots mishmash. That is, if you can name it at all.
On Saturday, Browns President Mike Holmgren said, “The one thing we’ve been able to do prior to the lockout and during the lockout . . . Tom Heckert and personnel people . . . we’ve been in endless meetings, so that when they actually lift the curtain, we’ll hit the ground running.”
