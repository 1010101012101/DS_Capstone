Perhaps Mugaritz is the restaurant equivalent of a $200 California Cabernet: It makes a statement odd enough and bold enough that it stands out among dozens of examples of its type, and it still resonates on the palate weeks later; a meal meant to stun you in retrospect as much as it is to satisfy you at the time you eat it.

Thankfully, a band of fiscal hawks in Congress is at long last embracing the GAO's repeated recommendations to make this common-sense change. Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, Republican Sens. Mike Enzi of Wyoming, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and John McCain of Arizona, and Rep. David Schweikert, an Arizona Republican, recently introduced the bipartisan COINS Act to eliminate the $1 bill and move fully to a $1 coin. These legislators are true leaders who are unafraid to take on a reluctant bureaucracy and entrenched special interests to find a creative way to reduce the deficit. Now, it's time for more of our leaders to get on board.

Day of show, back at the workroom. It's time for styling, and Mondo wants the makeup artist to draw a pencil-thin moustache on his model. Which is jaunty, if not particularly flattering. Casanova is dubious about the second dress Michael C. whipped up, saying every girl in Puerto Rico has that dress.

2009 Rhys Family Farm Vineyard San Mateo County Pinot Noir ($59, 13.3%): Kevin Harvey's project turned out a spectacular set of '09s, including this approachable, soon-to-be-released specimen from just outside the appellation boundary.

In typical Rhys fashion, it won't show its full potential for years. Or wait for Rhys' transcendent 2009 Horseshoe Vineyard ($59, 13.3%) coming later this year.

“The Mailman” was in the early stages of his Hall of Fame career in 1988, just 25 years old and playing his fourth season. He decided it was time to reveal his psychic powers on Nov. 16, 1988, because, well, let’s get back to Kahn’s story in The Oregonian:

It's hard to imagine anyone more in tune with the history and culture of that part of the country. Rash's books, particularly his last two novels, "Serena" (2008) and the new "The Cove," are set in a time and place only recently past but worlds away. The lives of his characters are those of our grandparents, recognizable to us not for what they did, making their own clothes and butter, but in their hard work and human frailty.

Turning point. Pomeranz leaving after three innings didn't affect the outcome as much as the week. The Rockies can't continue on this path — where the bullpen carries a bigger workload than the rotation.

Pomeranz could have his next start pushed back if his right quad doesn't heal quickly.

It is telling that the media description of the alleged victim in the Strauss-Kahn case highlights her religious devotion and life struggles -- factors that in many people's eyes would make her a more credible witness.

Second, almost $20 trillion of the $45.8 trillion of spending involves three programs -- Social Security, Medicare (health insurance for those 65 and over) and Medicaid (health insurance for the poor -- two-thirds goes to the elderly and disabled).

This is a wonderful sweet-tart marinade for grilled or broiled pork, lamb chops, quail or chicken, or pork, lamb or poultry kebabs. Use just enough to coat the meat or poultry, and marinate for 2 to 8 hours. Brush with a bit more during cooking. It caramelizes beautifully, providing sweet, smoky char. The pomegranate sauce also can be used as a basting sauce if you didn't have time to marinate the meat.

As one NFL scout said, many underclassmen who aren't ready for the league fall prey to the lure of instant money and following their friends. That's the word from some on Barner. He's not ready. He would be a tough sell to NFL decision makers. There are simply too many other more qualified, more accomplished and larger running backs than the 5-11, 195-pound Barner.

The song through which a lot of people discovered Gauthier (pronounced "Go-shay") was "I Drink," from her second album, Drag Queens in Limousines. Reprised on Mercy Now, with a new, simpatico production approach by alt-country veteran Gurf Morlix, "I Drink" is a simply stated tale of hand-me-down addiction. The opening verse chronicles Gauthier's dad coming home after work, fixing his drink and picking a fight with mama. It ends with the observation, "I got my daddy's blood inside me," before the chorus lists these matter-of-fact observations: "Fish swim / Birds fly / Daddies yell / Mamas cry / Old men / Sit and think / I drink."

In the plot, clean-cut Jack (Rogers) dreams of flying, but tinkers with a hot rod in the meantime. David (Arlen) is the only son of the richest family in town. They're both hot for Sylvia (Jobyna Ralston), though unbeknownst to Jack, Sylvia has pledged her heart to David. Girl-next-door Mary (Bow) loves Jack, but he barely knows she exists. This teen soap opera is rudely interrupted by World War I. Jack and David eagerly enlist, with both training to become pilots for the Army. (This was prior to the establishment of the Air Force.)

The two-game homestand was unforgettable. The anticipation leading to the games, the crowd's roar when Jorge Perlaza scored Jeld-Wen's first MLS goal, all of it. It was magical. In the second game, the unthinkable repeated itself. After taking a commanding 3-0 lead against FC Dallas, the Timbers and its fans went into cruise control. When Dallas scored the second of two quick goals with 10 minutes left to play, I wondered how the crowd would respond. At first it was silent, a temporary moment of shock. Then the crowd -- all of it -- rose to its feet and got to business. The place went nuts, willing the Timbers to their second win. At that moment, I knew it. If I wasn't all in before, I am now.

Okay, very funny, ha ha. But is the contempt really necessary? Does the commenter really think the Episcopal Church is ordaining inanimate objects (which, I say with a deep sigh, of course it is not), or does s/he just delight in the chance to put quotation marks around "Church" in order to make it clear that in his or her exalted opinion we don't qualify?

Obviously I can't speak for what happens in every Episcopal church pulpit, but I know that I strive to do nothing more or less than preach Christ crucified and resurrected, and to explicate the basic tenets of our faith (tenets we share with most if not all other Christians) in such a way that my congregation will feel both strengthened and challenged to go out and live their faith in the world.

For her American debut, British director Selina Cartmell manages to put by-now familiar devices to striking use.

In recent years, the Springsteen has been all over the place stylistically. His 17th album, the new "Wrecking Ball," weaves those adventures into a tour de force, complete with hip-hop beats and gospel choirs. While the lyrical throughline focuses on social justice, the music ranges from the grandeur of “Land of Hope and Dreams” to the Celtic stomp of “Death to My Hometown” to the down-home balladry of “We Are Alive.” The title track (inspired by the demolition of Giants Stadium) is a standout, too, with the late Clarence Clemons wailing away on sax.

My mom would squirrel the bonds away, and every now and then my older brother and I would peek at them to see how much "money" we had. But then the inevitable financial crisis would hit our family, and my brothers and I would give our bonds to our parents. I never regretted that, or even thought much about it, until my senior year of high school, when college costs loomed. Those $25 savings bonds might not have put a huge dent in my college costs, but it would have been that much less student-loan debt to carry.

They loved the parts of his stump speech that are well worn – our rights come from God and cannot be taken away by government – and a new attack on Obama spun off the day’s news – the president’s refusal to approve the Keystone oil pipeline is stupidly driving Canada into the arms of China.

As repulsive a human being as Noah is, at least he’s amusing. Aaron David Kapner neatly exudes the cockiness of the Manhattan resident who must constantly remind the Hoboken residents how much he’s slumming.
