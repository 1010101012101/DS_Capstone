Notes: Crystal City won the District 4 championship by knocking off Bayless 66-49 at Crystal City. Eli Sample (6-3, sr., G) leads CC at 19 points per game and hits on over 60 percent of his 2-pointers, 39 percent of his 3-pointers and 74 percent of his free throws. A mid-range jump shot is the biggest weapon in his arsenal. Stacey Thornton (5-8, sr., G) is at six assists and three steals per game.

øThe front-drive base version, called S, comes with a manual shift, but mileage ratings on the stick shift are 1 to 4 mpg worse than on the same machine with the automatic. And the manual's not available with 4Motion, VW's designation for all-wheel drive. It does provide a low-price model for the ads: $22,840 (before $820 shipping), which is $880 less than last year's S model Tiguan. The S with automatic is $480 less. But other models are the same as last year or slightly more.

I don't think it will have much of an effect as a result of the availability of the franchise tag. The Bears' ability to hit Forte with a tag for $7.7 million is a game changer in negotiations. Lynch's deal averages a little more than $7.7 a year. It's possible the Bears would go for a similar deal, but I'm not so sure that would satisfy Forte.

Laid back and soft-spoken off the field, Kenneth is drawn to the physical nature of the game. Even running with the ball, Kenneth sees himself as an attacker, not a target. His technique and footwork are raw, but coaches are drawn to his powerful running style and athleticism.
A loss would not only call into question Romneys ability to connect with more conservative voters, it would smash any air of inevitability about Romneys campaign. In Florida a month ago, after losing in South Carolina, he won decisively, hitting hard at Gingrich, his chief rival at the time. If Romney lost in Michigan, it would appear that his campaign organization wasnt as powerful as originally believed  though it still has more money and depth than the others, promising a long nomination fight.

The Princeton, N.J.-based company said in a May 2 regulatory filing that closing the facility would help it reach a goal of saving $20 million a year in its early development segment.
The threat of a major injury the biggest risk with any young pitcher. In parting with top prospect Jesus Montero, the Yankees gave up a lot for Pineda. Now, it appears more and more they will get zero return on that investment in its first year. I still think it was a bold trade by general manager Brian Cashman to make the play for Pineda, whose fastball last year sat in the mid-90s. But that boldness comes with major risk. We should find out today what tests have revealed about Pineda.

Bechard and Howard are now concerned with expansion. The couple spent a month of 17-hour days building a bar space for Thistle this winter and plan to open a European-style breakfast spot on Third Street later this year ("Grand Central meets Bunk sandwiches," with Stumptown espresso Fed-Exed in, Bechard says). And they're also expanding what's on Thistle's chalkboard menu: Bechard recently tried to persuade a farmer to start raising snails for escargot, and he grins devilishly when talking about the possibility of serving nut-fed squirrel.

"I'm not going to walk in and wipe everything clean," Leezer said. "We won't discount their knowledge. They've done great things. We've been successful not because of one person. David Rosenwasser was a great leader, but as talented as he is, he couldn't do all the sales, marketing and networking.

Cigarettes are often the first step for teens who go on to experiment with alcohol and other drugs. Many recovering alcoholics and recovering drug addicts struggle for years to stop smoking — without success — even though they've kicked their other dependencies.

It's fascinating to note how much these nominally real combat operations look like classic movie operations, or, conversely, how well the movies have been able to mimic combat reality. The genuine SEAL sharpshooter who never misses looks and acts exactly like the movie snipers we've all seen. Do these actual SEALs, who likely went to the movies before they went to war, feel like they are living in a 24/7 motion picture when they are in combat?

It's definitely a relief when Tenley and Kiptyn, in dressy costume, do their fox trot, which is charming, even if they fall down at the end. The guest judges -- Melissa, Jake, and Trista, back from the ancient mists of "Bachelor"/"Bachelorette" time -- give 'em 26 points. Kovacs and manipulative Elizabeth are terrible, and David and Natalie aren't much better. Tenley and Kiptyn win, which lets them choose which couple they'll compete with for the prize money.

Heidi is a lost child who doesn't realize she's lost, at least at first. After a violent falling-out with her mother, she leaves home and heads for an Australian ski town because a man who supposedly lives there once gave her a parka and told her to call. Men come off badly in "Somersault." So does the heroine; her judgment is dreadful, and her neediness is acute. What we're watching, though, is an ego structure finding its proper form, and that's not a prettified sight. After many predictable misadventures -- predictable to us, never to Heidi -- her defenses crumble, along with ours, and the make-believe woman is once again a child. That's a very moving sight.

We must all speak up. Only then will our children be free to express themselves and, dare I say, celebrate differences. This goes beyond race, gender, sexuality, social class or education.

Who no doubt said the same thing when they were fantasizing about hitting the ultimate jackpot.
The largely positive ad is the largest yet from Obama's campaign in terms of states targeted. And its factual claims are true, as far as they go. The economic meltdown largely began under President George W. Bush, and under Obama, the economy has created more than 4.2 million jobs. But millions remain out of work and the unemployment rate is at 8.1 percent, a historically high level. Obama supported bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler and both companies have dramatically improved their standing. The president ordered a U.S. military raid that killed bin Laden and American troops have left Iraq.

Part of what makes Stages, Sights and Sounds so popular is that the events are all kid-friendly. No, there isn't an age restriction on the full-on Humanities Festival events, but it's pretty hard to get a kid to sit still through a scientist or philosopher talking about his latest project and how it ties in to the Humanities Fest theme. Puppeteers with scissors or young performers climbing a wall is something else altogether. Here's a list of shows we'd make a beeline for:

"Reading isn't a one-size-fits-all activity," said Dr. Elizabeth Sugarbaker, a pediatrician at Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center and director of Reach Out and Read at Cardinal Glennon.

The Fire Authority submitted a detailed proposal. It believes it could save the city about $6.6 million over five years. The city took a look at it and thinks it can save perhaps as much as $15 million. Significantly, it will depend on firefighters agreeing to reduce some minimum manning – from 29 on duty at all times to 23 – but the Fire Authority was proposing the same. The city simply thinks it can get by with significantly less overhead.

Proponents of advanced statistics in baseball tended to laugh at Ivan Nova's "winning streak." After all, a pitcher's win-loss record does not demonstrate how he actually performed. Just look at Nova this year: In his first four starts of the season, he compiled a 3-0 record—and a 5.18 ERA.

Riding the first single, "In My Arms," the new album is doing well in England. But Thompson admits to being "slightly disenchanted" with the record business in the U.S. "I feel like it's a bit of a waste of time sometimes, touring and working in America, because you can feel like you're beating your head against a wall, touring around this huge country and feeling like you're not making an impact.

You can be a singer-songwriter without having to be so Americana or so indie-sounding, the boundaries are bit more blurred. I feel slightly less misunderstood there."

Sandusky coached the defense in Penn State's 1982 and 1986 national title seasons, and was at one point considered a likely successor to Paterno.

I like to wander around Stinky Bklyn, the Cobble Hill cheese shop, just to marvel at all the gourmet treats I can't afford: $80 bottles of olive oil, organic white truffle honey, Intelligentsia coffee. But recently, as I passed the cash register, my gastronomic reverie ground to a halt. There, alongside the $8 Mast Brothers Almonds & Sea Salt bars and Nunu chocolates, was a big, honking carton of Snickers bars.
Reigning NFL Coach of the Year Jim Harbaugh got into the action Thursday, too, still wearing his standard uniform of khaki slacks with a black fleece sweatshirt. He didn't get to lead any of the offseason workouts last spring as a first-year coach because of the lockout — and clearly had a little fun with his veterans during the optional session.

That's the set-up for "Safe House," a pulse-pounding secret-agent variation on the "everybody's out to get you" thriller formula. Well-cast, well-acted and brilliantly shot and edited, it's a thoroughly entertaining peek into spycraft and the spies who practice it.

The reporter, as in previous similar articles, finds one or more legal residents who are willing to say that the whole of the Hispanic population feels oppression from the police force when it is merely carrying out its normal job. Citing some innocent friend or relative as merely looking for honest work in this country does not help the situation but merely increases the complexity of the problem for the lawful authorities. If the legal immigrant does not uphold the law then that person may well be led into harboring a less innocent person and one, who in turn, may well prey upon their innocence and false sense of loyalty.
"We appreciate all these women being here. It is, it is a great country, and it’s exciting to see what women can do," she said to applause. "Yes! We know! We know what women can do. And how wonderful is the world, and how women actually do make the world go ’round."
Adding new lanes and rebuilding interchanges on nearly 200 miles of I-70 between St. Louis and Kansas City, one of the oldest segments of interstate in the country, is a priority. But with a price tag of $2 billion to $4 billion, it's also something Missouri can't afford.

The hall should begin with a mea culpa. Eric B. and Rakim are arguably the most important figures in the history of the form, and no serious discussion of hip-hop history can take place without including them. Deejay Eric B.’s aggressive sampling of James Brown and ’70s funk made rap music harder, denser and groovier, and powerful echoes of his stylistic innovations can still be heard all over Hot 97 today. Rapper Rakim substituted dense wordplay and extended metaphors for straightforward rhymes, defied conventional rhythmic barriers and forever altered the way emcees approached verse-writing.
It wasn't hard for Lindsey to find the wrong path. It was all around him.
The NYPD spying operations began after the 2001 terror attacks with unusual help from a CIA officer. The agency's inspector general recently found that relationship problematic but said no laws were broken. Shortly after that report, the CIA decided to cut short the yearlong tour of an operative who was recently assigned to the NYPD.
These conditions have not been met in Syria. This is not a war of necessity for the United States; our vital national interests are not in danger. To justify American involvement — limited or otherwise — policymakers have yet to answer a number of questions. Have all diplomatic alternatives been exhausted? Can Russia and China be won over? What is the objective, the strategy, the end game?

A note on the producer: Tony D, aka Harvey Wallbanger, who did most of the "Holy Intellect" album, was the main Trenton rap impresario of the early '90s. He kicked the first verse on the first track on "Holy Intellect" -- the clumsy but oh-so-memorable "Can I Start This?" -- and rhymed "esophagus" with "get off of this." Well, I was sold for life right then and there, and I went out of my way to pick up his other productions, even the crummy ones. By the late part of the decade, he'd disappeared, and eventually I forgot about him. Until last year, when I got the news that Tony D had died in a car crash. A piece of Mercer County musical history went with him; a meaningful one. This was the NJ.COM report of the accident; no mention of the victim's role in shaping the sound of Jersey rap. He did, you know. Keep the name alive: Anthony Depula. Wise Intelligent would want you to.

Friends of Mr. Chen said his escape from his home in the village of Dongshigu in Shandong province on April 22 was carefully planned.

Like the Brewhouse, the Everglades BBQ Smokehouse is one of the more popular destinations at the Trop. The Smokehouse is a new addition, replacing the Batter's Eye Restaurant on the second level in centerfield. This is a sit-down restaurant featuring barbecue and a large salad bar, but a small full-liquor bar near the entrance provides the same panoramic view of centerfield that diners are afforded. The Smokehouse also is where broadcaster Rich Herrera holds his pre- and post-game radio shows, complete with a kitschy "On Air" sign that lights up during the show.
The coverage plan was designed to blend the strengths of both the paper and online versions of the newsroom.
We have cloudy mental images about November of ’56, but it was a heady time. It was the month Soviet tanks smashed Budapest to quell the Hungarian Revolution. It was the month Britain and France bombed Egypt to force the reopening of the Suez Canal to their oil tankers. It was the month Fidel Castro and Che Guevera — six weeks out of Veracruz — could now see the coastline of the Cuban island they would soon take by revolution. It was the month that the Montgomery Bus Boycott, spawned by the courage of a tiny woman from Tuskegee named Rosa Parks, neared the end of its historic 381-day triumph against segregation.
Overlapping coverage: The Cleveland and Akron airports are 53 miles apart. Even if the new Southwest makes money at both airports, it may make a tactical decision against flying out of two nearby places. When Southwest has served close cities, it's usually been on the densely populated coasts.

The RingSide Fish House sets out an appealing range of vibrantly fresh seafood offerings. In a city that has had a curious difficulty, considering its location, in opening and maintaining serious seafood restaurants, it's a useful addition. If the menu could use another serving of imagination, maybe it just takes time to adapt from steak to sturgeon.

Like most of Hellman's public statements about her political activities, this was a lie. It is because of her political activism that Hellman, whose literary output was of variable quality, has been the subject of countless biographies and academic studies. In "A Difficult Woman," Alice Kessler-Harris, a professor of history at Columbia University, returns to this well-tilled soil, offering an "empathetic view of Hellman and her politics."

What a wonderful opportunity for the University of Michigan to open its football season in the new Cowboys Stadium in Texas. However, there seems to be a half-hearted effort to show the full U-M experience. It seems the world-famous University of Michigan marching band is being told it cannot go on this trip, even though the university will make millions off this game and Alabama is bringing its band.
New Blazers Gerald Wallace and Wesley Matthews topped the voting at 98 percent each.

Manning writes: "This is an incredibly common condition," but only about 20% of those affected seek help, says Daniel Sklare, a program director at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. Cost is a factor (hearing aids can run $1,600 to $3,000 each or more) as well as the "stigma" of wearing them, he says.

Rauschenberg's voracious appetite for experimentation characterized his working method, which employed new techniques and unusual materials. In 1954, a decade before his Venice triumph, he began to make a new kind of art that combined traditional elements of painting and sculpture, together with collage and printing. He dubbed these works "combine paintings." Two of the most famous are "Bed" (1955) and "Monogram" (1955-1959). For "Bed," he scribbled pencil marks and smeared paint on a well-worn pillow, sheets and a quilt, which hang on the wall like a traditional painting. "Monogram" is a floor piece featuring a stuffed Angora goat with a used automobile tire around its middle; the goat is mounted atop a low platform covered with painted and collaged images.

The president would reduce the current 35 percent corporate tax, which is the highest in the world after Japan but which many corporations avoid by taking advantage of deductions, credits and exemptions.

This is getting thin quickly. There was no true No. 3 receiver this year, and leading receiver and team MVP Dane Sanzenbacher is a senior. Take out Posey, and the top receivers returning next year are current freshmen Corey Brown (seven catches, 92 yards) and redshirt freshman Chris Fields (three catches, 22 yards) from Painesville Harvey.

That leaves current first-year receivers T.Y. Williams and James Louis, second-year player James Jackson and incoming freshmen Evan Spencer and Devin Smith to enter the fray, with the Buckeyes desperate for some go-to guys to emerge, with Brown the most likely candidate.

5. Steve Stricker, United States -- Stricker had a chance to record his second victory of the season last week, but he ran out of steam on the back nine Sunday while closing with a 2-under-par 70 to finish solo sixth in the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. It was his fourth top-10 result of the season on the PGA Tour and his best result since he captured the season-opening Hyundai Tournament of Champions. ... Stricker is taking another week off ahead of the Players Championship and is skipping the Wells Fargo Championship, which he has not played since 2008. He has played at Quail Hollow three times, missing the cut in 2003 and 2008 but finishing solo second in 2007. He played the weekend that year in 66-69, his only two rounds in the 60s on the course in eight tries, and finished two strokes behind Tiger Woods. ... Stricker played brilliant golf for 3 1/2 rounds last week at TPC Louisiana, posting rounds of 66-68-69 before playing the front nine in a flawless 3-under-par 33 on Sunday. However, he could manage only eight pars and a bogey, at No. 15, on the final nine to wind up four shots out of the playoff in which Jason Dufner beat Ernie Els. The back nine was his problem all week -- he played the front in a cumulative 15-under while struggling to a total of even par on the last nine holes. His putter was not as good as it usually is. After taking only 26 putts in the first round, he needed 29 on each of the last three days.

Sean Meagher: Following the end of the season Nate McMillan mentioned roster imbalance, saying, among other things, the Blazers have two starters at the small forward position in Gerald Wallace and Nic Batum. While Batum has started more games than not, he appears to be the perfect first man off the bench for Portland as long as Wallace is here. Dallas has Jason Terry, a guy who could easily start, as its sixth man. And the same is true for Lamar Odom, the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year, in Los Angeles. I don't see why with a little increased consistency and intensity Batum, who is just 22, couldn't fill the same role for the Blazers. As they say, it doesn't matter how you start but how you finish.

Kaminsky and Ravine contrast sharply in the first act. The former is thin and straight-backed in her conservative 1930s clothing (unobtrusively designed by costumer Jeff Cone), slightly pinched in the face, proper and businesslike. Ravine's shackled prisoner, worry tightening her features, is a large presence despite her bondage. She shows her stiff acquaintance how to undulate her body in one of her songs, and for a moment these very different beings become closer, although Pearl doesn't trust Susannah's ambitious plans for a music tour ("When you sneeze, it's a hurricane for me," she points out).

Her intentions are sterling -- to show the horror of the conflict visited upon all sides involved -- and her direction is sure. On the other hand, the story feels forced at times, its tone oddly mismatched at others. Still, Jolie has chosen a complex subject for her feature debut as a writer and director, and although not perfect, it's not for lack of trying.
Get ready to dive deep into your closet, and your psyche. Baumgartner, a psychologist and wardrobe consultant, diagnoses nine shopping/fashion problems -- such as overspending, failing to dress your age and being a slave to labels -- then offers a treatment plan from both stylistic and psychological perspectives. While the book can get a little wordy at times (a photo here and there would've been great), it's fascinating to read how much what we wear on the outside reflects who we are on the inside.

After swimming circles around the clueless carp czar John Goss and his wishy-washy White House handwringers, the fiendish filter-feeders have lucked upon this even more insidious offensive, one that eschews the waterways for the highways.
Sim is happy, too, but not completely satisfied just yet. While he's enjoyed Oregon's conference run so far, the lack of NCAA Tournament play in his career has nagged at him. As far as Sim's concerned, the Ducks are more than capable of playing in the postseason; sure, the College Basketball Invitational is nice, but he'd prefer the real March Madness this year. And while the Beavers' snub still pushes him, he's not concerned about his individual performance.
And when they do, the outcome is nearly always bad for the cyclist.

Hayward's early attempts to shift blame to the rig operator, Transocean, failed to take the heat off BP. Later remarks that the amount of oil pouring into the Gulf was "tiny" compared to its volume of water and Hayward's whining that he would "like my life back" made him an object of scorn. That emotion turned to fury when Gulf residents heard that Hayward spent a day at a fancy English sailing race in which his yacht was competing at the height of the disaster.

A: We are not finished yet, but this is a huge day for the city of Atlanta. What giving us the additional time is going to do is, it's going to allow us...to be more thoughtful, to make sure we're not making mistakes. It gives us some flexibility.

Any pea decorated in that coloration, in whatever design, suggests to me what my family used to call the Hereford pea, I suppose because it came close to sharing the colors of that breed of cattle. Or maybe not. For all I know, we called them Herefords because we got the seed from a neighbor with that name.

The modern dress works well. What might have been a stunt emphasizes the military aspects of the play—those automatic weapons don't exclude mano a mano combat with knives—and intensifies the domestic drama that might have seemed more remote had it been cloaked in gowns and togas. That's not to suggest that the film is instantly accessible. It takes a while, assuming a willingness to invest the effort, before you can tune into the marvelous language, then get beyond it to concentrate on revelations of character.

California wasn't always so reliant on the rich. In the 1970s, the sales tax, not the income tax, was the state's top source of revenue. Unlike the income tax, which is progressive, meaning it hits the wealthy hardest, the sales tax is regressive –it has the biggest relative impact on the lower and middle class, who spend a larger share of their incomes on taxable goods.

Wildlife artist Grainger McKoy has been fascinated with the craft of carving and with the subject of birds since he was a boy. After graduation from Clemson, McKoy began an apprenticeship under experienced bird sculptor Gilbert Maggioni, who encouraged McKoy to pursue his art. In his South Carolina studio, McKoy creates lifelike sculptures of birds feeding, flocking, fleeing danger -- or fighting. As part of his attention to detail, McKoy inserts individual wood feathers, rather than carving them from an existing block. McKoy’s realistic bird art may be out of reach for some, but his 2012 calendar is not. The 12-month wall calendar includes 16 wildlife images.

Evangelicals have had four years to reflect on our community's response to Mitt Romney's candidacy in 2008. I think many of us have recognized that anti-Mormon prejudice colored our initial responses to Mr. Romney's candidacy in 2008, that it should not have then, and that it should not now. That doesn't mean I support the man's candidacy — or, for that matter, that I don't. But it does mean that I look at the candidate, not the sacred book under his arm.

Power-alley one is that Art of Animation is getting to the point where we're leveraging stories and the equity of our products. The second is this whole family-suite issue; the world has changed around us, and we're seeing a lot more multigenerational families traveling and celebrating together, whether it's reunions or special events or what have you. And we're seeing the fact that they're wanting to play together at Disney and but also stay together in our hotels.

No, these four nice power-pop guys from Halifax aren’t betraying anybody. The title refers to the Roman numeral for 20 — that’s how many years they’ve hung together. Firm believers in the Beatlesque pop-rock tradition, Sloan is a band that never has feared longevity. They are often seen as something of a music factory, but there is far more variety in their catalog than they’re given credit for. “The Double Cross,” their 10th album, steps back from the protracted suite-style grandeur of “Never Hear the End of It” and the uneven hard-rock ambitions of “Parallel Play,” its immediate predecessors. Instead, they’ve fallen back on their core skill: writing sharp, backward-looking, irresistibly catchy pop songs. The twinkling “Green Gardens, Cold Montreal” and the bubbly “Beverly Terrace” could have been on any of Sloan’s excellent early sets, and the resemblance of “Your Daddy Will Do” to “Don’t You Believe a Word” (from their 1999 album “Between the Bridges”) seems intentional. In fact, “The Double Cross” feels very much like the underrated “Bridges” — not a grand statement but a collection of fine, winning singalong tracks from a group that long ago mastered the art of writing them.
