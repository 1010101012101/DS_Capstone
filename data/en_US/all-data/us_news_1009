That's a notable thing about Joshua Tree National Park and the towns around it. While legions of Californians keep their faces to the beach, no matter the season, a certain stripe of traveler is powerless to resist the desert, especially in cooler months. They come for the wide-open spaces and quirky lodgings you see in the park-adjacent towns of Joshua Tree and 29 Palms. They come for the bands at Pappy & Harriet's, for the steaming pools of lithium-rich water at Desert Hot Springs or maybe for a sound bath (to be explained soon) at the Integratron in Landers.

"The insurgency has been beaten back to a considerable extent. This summer offers them an opportunity to not only repulse Taliban attacks like the one in Kabul last month, but also to expand their safe zones and reduce internal (insurgent) sanctuaries, which in turn will - in theory - give the (Afghan forces) and the government an opportunity to set in a little bit more deeply."

The factors that have separated the teams have been minimal, namely the Blues' power play (or, depending how you view things, San Jose's penalty-killing) and their goaltending. Brian Elliott stopped 24 of 25 shots in Game 4, some spectacularly, while the Blues have scored on six of 16 power plays. It will behoove San Jose not to take any silly penalties. Meanwhile, the Sharks have scored on two of 15 power plays.

Tarantino, who has since apologized for the incident, is heard on the tape using vulgar language to describe parents, other board members and the Democratic Party.

With that majority, comes the right to award pricey contracts to politically connected professionals.

Greg Couch, FoxSports.com: "The Self image has more than evolved in the past few years, it has transformed. Bill Self used to be a TV-ready salesman with a nice smile, a warm handshake and a friendly little drawl. If he meets you today, he will remember two years later what you were wearing, and ask about specific family members. He could land great recruits, but then couldn't win big with them. It was a classic coaching category: Great recruiter, can't coach. Now, he is a coaching guru, a genius. Did Self change, or was it just his image? Is it just the way we label coaches and athletes, everything so black and white? This is fact: Self has lost early in the NCAA tournament with great teams. The title he won? Five of his players were selected in the next NBA Draft. Who can't win a college title with a pro team? Whatever, this much is also true: This Kansas team is not loaded. The one time Self's recruiting let him down, he has had to rely on his own wits and skills."

Some will be uncomfortable with the idea of a "living truth" because it accepts flexibility according to time, place, and circumstance in a nasty world of change. But those who are observant have witnessed again and again that when absolutist offenders of ethics and the law get caught, their first line of defense is to argue they should be excused because of time, place or circumstance. They suddenly become poster board displays of situational ethics.

Holding meetings standing up isn't new. Some military leaders did it during World War I, according to Allen Bluedorn, a business professor at the University of Missouri.

Dear Margo: I work for a small company on a team of four women in their late 20s. There's a problem with one of my colleagues that might strike you as odd. "Mary" suffers from severe PMS. Several days before the onset of her menses, she turns into a nightmare. Moreover, she gets a leave of absence for a couple of days each month because she feels ill when she has her period. I'm not a freak who makes another lady's cycle her business, but after working so closely for two years, you just notice such things. In the first months of working together, I sympathized, but it's getting to be too much now.

I gently suggested she consult a doctor. Her answer boils down to "no use seeing a doctor, that's the way I was born." I brought this up to our boss, who told me he is aware of the behavior but is reluctant to let her go because of her knowledge of our company, which is true. Also, he is reluctant to deal with the whole subject. Should I start looking for another job? Should I start nagging our boss? — Feeling Stuck

In Luke chapter 8, we have the Parable of the Sower recorded (verses 4-8). Later in this chapter after Christ is asked about the parable, He explains it (verses 11-18). What is important is that Christ said the 'seed" is God's word. You see, even when we think we have failed as a Christian spouse, parent, teacher or leader of a congregation, as long as we live the faith, teach the faith and abide in the faith, we have planted the seed: the word of God (Luke 8:11-18; Gal 2:20; John 15:10; James 1:22-27).

But it would've been more wrong to have evidence that a judge viewed an attorney appearing in her court on a capital case as "Amos and Andy" -- to use one example -- and do nothing about it.
As NFL offenses have evolved, the role of the fullback -- Jim Brown's position, for heaven's sake -- has been relegated to pure blocker. A series of rules changes since 1974 have made it harder for defensive backs to cover receivers while also providing more protection for quarterbacks.

-- Riley was also happy with the growth of the linebackers, and said that when D.J. Welch is healthy (he sat out the last few days with a hamstring issue) he has shown tremendous promise. The same can be said for Michael Doctor and Feti Unga, though Unga will need to prove it in games. Riley said he thinks Unga was "a good playmaker" in spring ... Doctor was mentioned by a handful of people during April has someone with the killer instinct OSU has seemed to lack the last few seasons.

On the outskirts of the city, Tommy and Andy are the first team to discover the next Detour, which is divided into "Grass Fed" or Rice "Field." In Rice Field, teams have to deliver lunch to a group of rice farmers and then plant 300 rice shoots in the mud. The Grass Fed challenge requires teams to fill two bags with grass, collect two lambs and then fill a trough with six buckets of water. Like most restaurants these days, the teams are heavily about Grass Fed, even though it may actually be the harder challenge, what with the sheep herding. As Tommy and Andy collect their grass and walk their sheep, Laurence and Zac, the father-and-son adventurers, soon catch up. However, Laurence and Zac fail to read their clue closely and inadvertently bend the rules using four buckets, when the clue indicates only two per team. Tommy (or Andy, it's hard to tell them apart) warns them to read their clue closely, but they ignore the advice.

His loose take on “pepper pot” was also intriguing, focused on a soft hunk of slow-braised short rib. But the dish was so sweet, both from too many bell peppers and the odd addition of currant jelly, that it strayed too far from the old-school source.

Some of these "subsidiaries" are nothing more than postal boxes. In fact, there is a single building in the Cayman Islands that is home to 18,857 registered corporations. Companies that make profits in America benefit from our roads, education system and security. They should therefore pay taxes to support those benefits like the rest of us, plain and simple.

But in the last few years, pledges from the congregation haven't covered the annual budget. The church dipped into the endowment to meet operating expenses.
