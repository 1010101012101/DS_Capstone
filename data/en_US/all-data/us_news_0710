Favorite weekend away: San Francisco. For a while, 2010 was a bit of a golden age for travel between Orange County and San Francisco.

The Galaxy took a 1-0 lead off a free kick last week that a furious Rapids goalkeeper Matt Pickens blamed on teammates being too slow in setting up the wall.

That's just me, being patriotic. Your priorities may lie elsewhere. And yes, hybrid haters, you're being teased.

Peter King, SI.com: "Throw away the draft trade value chart. It's meaningless when there's a player creating the buzz of (Robert) Griffin. Same thing with Ryan Leaf 14 years ago. Forget what Leaf became; he and Peyton Manning, at one point after the college football season, were 1 and 1a on draft boards for any quarterback-needy teams. San Diego was picking third that year and Arizona second. The Cards put the pick up for auction. To move one spot, San Diego sent two first-round picks, a second- and three-time Pro Bowl running back/returner Eric Metcalf. The Rams will drive a hard bargain. Cleveland (fourth overall pick), Washington (sixth) and Miami (eighth) will be in the derby to move up; Seattle (12) and a couple of mystery teams could be too. Add the fact that the money involved (four years, about $22 million) is likely to be less than the money paid to the top (current) free agent Matt Flynn, and the market for Griffin will be hopping."

3. Help scale up domestic production of 21st-century technologies, and export American-made products around the world. For too long, American researchers have developed ideas only to see them produced in countries like China and Germany. For example, while many clean-energy technologies were invented in the United States, more than 70 percent of components are produced overseas. China is on track to make half of the world's wind turbines and solar panels -- with plans to sell most of them here.

The truth about healing is that heal is a television word. Someone close to you dies? You will never heal. What will happen is, for the first few days, the people around you will touch your shoulder and this will startle you and remind you to breathe. You will feel as though you will soon be dead from natural causes; the weight of the grief will be physical and very nearly unbearable.

2010 ... 3B ZACK COX (25th overall): On draft day, Cox went 2-for-4 with a run scored. He beat Miller to Class AA, and he started his career on the 40-man roster, something the other nine picks mentioned did not. Cox is hitting .317/.374/.418 overall this season, which he started at High-A Palm Beach. In 12 games at Double-A, Cox is hitting .250/.353/.341 with 10 runs, one homer and five RBIs. He was leading the organization in batting average at the time of his promotion. The Texas League offers him a better chance to show how his power is developing, and while the Cardinals expect him to remain at third base the possibility of a move to second base exists. The addition of Wong could make the Cardinals more reluctant to make that move unless it's the only way to fit Cox onto the major-league team in the comings years. As a member of the 40-man roster, Cox had to be optioned to the minors this season, so his clock is ticking. Grade: Earned a B+ on his first-quarter exam.
Why go through this process, when you could just sit down at the kitchen table and draw up a loan document? Burke emphasizes that the IRS rules say the borrower can deduct the mortgage interest only if the loan is properly registered on the title and secured as a mortgage. That's what makes the $599 fee for creating the mortgage document worth it. Plus, having a servicing record of on-time payments will make it easier to refinance. Most important, this documentation assures there will never be any misunderstanding between family members - or the IRS - about who owes what and when it must be paid. That's the Savage Truth.

The sliding tax that is proposed in Gov.Martin O'Malley's legislation will help to promote water conservation. Those that use less, pay less.

_ Money-market funds: A net $22 billion was withdrawn from these funds in April, about one-third of the $69 billion total that flowed out in March. Money-market funds are designed to be safe harbors where investors can temporarily park cash and quickly access it when needed. However, their appeal has been reduced because returns have been barely above zero — they're now averaging 0.03 percent — for about three years. Money fund returns are closely tied to interest rates. Prospects of higher returns dimmed in January when the Federal Reserve said it doesn't expect to raise its benchmark rate until late 2014, at the earliest, because the economic recovery remains fragile.

He's not alone in that. In sports and entertainment there is a slightly twisted view of respect. If you're not willing to pay me what I think I'm worth then you don't respect me. Maybe we can't blame him for that, since we all have a little of that in us, but we can hold him accountable for his own words.

The trouble with battling yourself is that nobody can lose but you. Kanye West learns everything the hard way, yes, but he spins gold from his misfortune. Hater, can you say the same? We know how carefully he selects beats; this time he’s been judicious with his word choices, too. Deep within this glittering pleasure dome, dichotomies emerge: light versus dark, rulership versus servitude, the pain of exposure versus the pain of anonymity. I still believe West’s 2008 album "808s and Heartbreak" will eventually be recognized as his crowning achievement, but every time I play "Fantasy," I become a little less sure.

Which is what made St. Joseph's scoring a pair of goals within the blink of an eye to tie that district title game at 2 such a stunner.
On the Republican side, the fresh numbers captured the ever-changing dynamics of a battle in which Romney only recently his cemented his front-runner status.

Both have been restrained by their legislative bodies not quite eager enough to go to the limit for the executive branches. Obama most recently failed to persuade the Senate, where his party holds a solid majority, to adopt his "Buffet Rule" to extract extra taxes from millionaires. And Brown has had to resort to a ballot initiative because of the inability to get added taxes through the Legislature, despite both houses being firmly held by Democratic majorities.

It's clear from Saturday's antics that the military tribunal, which is not expected to begin until May 2013, will be a circus. Defense attorneys don't have much of a claim to the clients' innocence. In 2007, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed issued a statement in which he proclaimed that he was the mastermind of 9/11, "from A to Z." In 2008, KSM and his co-defendants told a military court that they were guilty and wanted to be martyred.

The equally just-for-show Buffett Rule, nicely pitting the 99 percent versus the 1 percent, is a clever bit of class warfare designed to let Democrats play tribune of the middle class.
B.o.B: Working with Dr. Luke is good, but sometimes you may run into disagreements, certain things that may rub an artist a certain way. For example, when I recorded "Both of Us" (featuring Taylor Swift), I recorded my vocals on the hook, but when it was time to turn the masters in, he snatched my vocals right when it was time to turn in the masters. And so, as an artist it kind of makes you feel like, "I guess it's his song." I don't know. He's a talented dude, but sometimes when you work with a producer, sometimes their ego may get in the way into really making it a completely mutual project.

At a conservative conference Saturday in Milwaukee, Santorum continued the scathing assault on Romney that he launched in Louisiana.
General Motors opted not to place warnings on its conventional vehicles' gas caps, but that's not a sign of support for E15.

Less enticing: The ballpark -- at least for now -- is an island surrounded by cotton fields and vacant land. Initial plans called for the development of a unique 240-acre "Ballpark Village" around the stadium, including hotels, a conference center and shopping. But those plans have been delayed because of a nasty legal battle between the family who owns the land and the (now former) developer. The Wood family, longtime cotton farmers in the West Valley, is seeking another developer for the project.
Obama campaign advisor David Axelrod later tweeted, "What VP said-that all married couples should have exactly the same legal rights-is precisely POTUS's position."
Doctors can speak into a microphone and the notes will appear electronically in the file. "Some doctors are apprehensive and want to remain in the comfort zone of their charts, but this will improve office productivity," said Nebb, who attended the conference.
Now, I don't like "Mercy." Whether you do or don't doesn't matter; neither is the point whether anyone really wants to reflect on the miserable end to the Cardinals' season. The point is that KSDK has a monopoly on NBC programming in St. Louis. Just as it has a contract with NBC, the station has an unwritten contract with viewers, to show NBC programs as scheduled, three hours a night in prime time. If the station doesn't do that, shouldn't we be allowed to watch NBC on a different station from a different city?
White's attorney contended that only those who presented band officials with a class schedule at the start of the fall semester were given a Marching 100 uniform. Chuck Hobbs, however, said it was not up to the Department of Music to verify the enrollment.
Boyle debuted his first solo dress collection Saturday night, an unexpected pairing of easy-flowing, gorgeously draped Grecian tunics over tightly laced corsets. The dresses were deceptively simple. A long, draped column in greige, modestly, artfully fell over one shoulder as the model walked forward on the runway, only to reveal her bare back, tightly laced into a corset of silken chocolate brown -- sexy sophistication indeed.
"The X Factor": Simon Cowell predicted his talent competition would take America by storm, but that turned out to be a blast of hot air. The singing show has earned good ratings, but not the blockbuster numbers Mr. Ego promised. In any case, Season 1 of the U.S. edition ends tonight, and the winner is announced. (8 p.m., Fox/12)
Bye-bye, Ubaldo. I think Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki is a class act. However, I would have loved to see him thump Cleveland pitcher Ubaldo Jimenez after getting beaned. Tulo's career is continuing to take off, and Ubaldo's is plummeting. So glad the Rockies dumped Jimenez when they did.
