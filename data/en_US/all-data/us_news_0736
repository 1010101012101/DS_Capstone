Cities differ markedly in how tightly their borders are drawn around their inner core, and how much of outlying areas are included within city limits can have a big effect on crime levels. The rankings are based only on reported crime, and reporting rates vary, criminologists say. Also, personal safety varies tremendously depending on lifestyle, income and neighborhood.
Remember that the "Magic/Bird" target audience wasn't the typical Broadway regular. This wasn't the show for someone looking for singing anthropomorphized kitties based on T.S. Eliot poems.

The question is, should you have to pay for a brand-new ticket? I don't think so, but airline rules say otherwise.

And stick around until the end of the festival, Kowal said, for a very special group hug. ...

This was the final nail in Lindsey’s coffin for me. A cursory glance at Twitter indicates much of the American public enjoyed her sanitized, stilted cover of the “Skinny Love,” and if that’s the case, America is dumb as a rock. “I love this song,” Christina said. “People connect with this song; it’s a special thing, and people see you as a special thing.” It is a special song.

That's because only 10 offensive linemen will be in camp when spring practice begins today, which as Tressel pointed out, leaves the Buckeyes one sprained ankle away from being unable to fill out two full lines. That's an issue for the spring, for sure, but is also something to keep in mind for the fall, when the Buckeyes will add three other freshmen but will still be without much wiggle room.

He missed the cut two years ago in the Wells Fargo Championship with the highest 36-hole score of his career, a surprise but not entirely unexpected because it was only his second tournament since his return from the downfall in his personal life. Friday was more stunning, not only because he missed a 4-foot birdie putt on his 17th hole that would have allowed him to make the cut, but it came just more than a month after he won at Bay Hill.

Butchers will generally pound or slice meat for you, but if you find yourself with a thick piece of meat at home, no worries. Simply sandwich it between two pieces of plastic wrap, get out your heaviest skillet or pan, and start whacking. Take care to be even - i.e. move around with each smack - lest you tear clear through the meat, and stop when it's a quarter-inch thick.

Although the first season boasted what remains the quintessential "Portlandia" bit -- the "Dream of the '90s" music video -- it was apparent that the creative team was finding its voice and figuring out what the show was.

The best thing Maddow does is resist portraying the drift to unfettered war power as a conspiracy concocted by an evil cabal. These choices were made by intelligent men and women who seemed to truly believe they had the best interests of the country in mind. These very smart, patriotic people promoted really foolish policies because they were guided by poor information, blinded by ideology or driven by political expediency. With rare exceptions, they were not motivated by actual wickedness. (For pure wickedness, check out Maddow's chapters covering the misdeeds and greed of private contractors in the Balkans and Iraq.)

Mr. Frederick states that children will lead a more normal life if they are raised by heterosexual couples. Unfortunately, that's not always the case. Being raised by unhappy couples does not always lead to happy memories of one's childhood. Although I do not approve of same-sex marriages, I do know that there are many of these partners who have chosen to adopt, use a surrogate or any other means to become parents and are proud of their decisions and are giving those children more love and devotion than they would have received otherwise.

U.S. officials believed the unrest earlier this month sparked by U.S. troops inadvertently burning copies of the Koran had had begun to die down as a result of extraordinary apologies the president and U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta delivered to President Karzai. Last year, Afghans were outraged by reports that a rogue Army unit that killed several Afghan for sport, then covered up the crimes by claiming the victims were insurgents, and by photographs showing another unit urinating on the corpses of Taliban fighters they had killed. The outrage sparked by all three incidents threatened to derail Mr. Obama's carefully calibrated timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops.

Helping that light to shine has been on my mind during as 2011 comes to a close. The day after Christmas, my 13-year old son and I headed downtown.

They had a story to him, and had become persons who also journey in the light of Christmas faith. We both became aware of the ways we are called to help that light shine.

Talking to "Dream" creator/writer/director Roger Bean at the champagne cast party following the show I found that the musical has been playing in Los Angeles for a year and has won multiple Ovation Awards, LA Drama Critics Circle Awards and LA Weekly Awards. I also found out that before "Dream," Bean and producer David Elzer had collaborated on The Marvelous Wonderettes, a feel-good musical about a late '50s close-harmony girls group, which ran for two years at the El Portal Theatre in North Hollywood and had a brisk run at the Laguna Playhouse in the summer of 2008 before playing successfully off-Broadway. "Jukebox musicals have gotten a new respect with the likes of Rock of Ages, Smokey Joe's Café, and Jersey Boys, Bean said, "so I think we can compete with the best of 'em." The "Dream" production is still running in Los Angeles, so the two shows are running simultaneously. However, the Laguna Playhouse cast are the five original cast members. "They'd gone their separate ways," Bean said, "but came back to do the show." Elzer indicated a Broadway run was in the offing. Hear! Hear!

The great equalizer in college basketball is the three-point shot. Should KU get hot from beyond the arc, they can score lots of points in a hurry. Such shooting would allow them to play with pace and maybe, just maybe, get Kentucky a bit out of sorts.

"This (Stag) closure is not surprising to me. The likelihood of this came up in conversation when I was in London in November. InBev has been consolidating the breweries it purchased years ago from what was then Whitbread and Bass. The UK beer market is in really rough shape with significant sales declines. The remaining international brewers producing in the UK, Heineken, A-B Inbev and Carlsberg will continue to consolidate production and sell off valuable land for development. The two breweries I worked at in the UK, S&N's (now Heineken) Fountain Brewery in Edinburgh and Young's are both closed. Like so many others they were located in prime property sites. So many breweries have been closed in the UK in the past 20 years and there are more to come as Heineken closes the former Courage Berkshire Brewery at Reading (on the M4 just west of Heathrow airport) and Carlsberg closes the famous Tetley Brewery in Leeds. These like the Stag Brewery site in Mortlake will become houses, apartments, offices and shops. In fact Fullers in Chiswick will be the only large-scale brewery left in London and while it is relatively large at about 500,000 bbls it is small compared to the big guys. There are new 'craft' brewers in the UK and hopefully many will grow to take the place of the older independents that have closed."

The Vatican said the LCWR defended itself in part by arguing that the group "does not knowingly invite speakers who take a stand against a teaching of the church'when it has been declared as authoritative teaching.'" The LCWR also said that assertions made by speakers at LCWR conferences are not necessarily their own. The Vatican called that response "inadequate" and unsupported by the facts.

Ms. Ambrose has the potential to pair the enthusiasm these and other fresh faces have brought to the state GOP with her experience of what it takes to get things done on the campaign trail and her contacts in the national party. It may take some time to ease the bruised feelings from her race against Ms. Scott, and in any case, the path to success won't be easy for Maryland Republicans. But her win provides some hope that the generational shift now underway in the state GOP could help make the party more viable and provide voters with more and better choices in the years ahead.

Derek and Chantal have three little children. She's a former model who has most of the child-rearing responsibilities. In addition to thinking Derek doesn't appreciate how much work it takes to raise three kids, she still feels wistful resentment that he never actually proposed to her when they got married or gave her an engagement ring. For his part, he thinks she's making too much out of the whole engagement ring thing and ought to just be the "hot mama" she was during the four years before they got married.

Lastly, although it may sound crass, the enormous loss of workers whose lives were cut very short by wars wreaked tremendous damage to the system. From a purely analytical view, many of those men and women would have paid into the system for 30 to 45 years before collecting. Many would never have collected and many others would have collected little before passing on. I'm not an actuary but I believe that would have made quite a difference in the state of Social Security today. Mr. Morici's solution — to raise the retirement age — hopefully, in stages so as not to disenfranchise those between 65 and 70, may help, but it isn't enough unless the entire system is reworked. But that is a job for an accredited economist such as Mr. Morici, perhaps.
The Wellmont is booked by New York-based promoters Bowery Presents.

Oregon doesn't wind up richer that way. In fact, the state might get poorer if gamblers simply shift their loyalties to the casino from the Oregon Lottery games in local bars and restaurants. (Those bars and other retailers get about 25 percent of the lottery take, which helps them hire employees. State government gets the rest to pay for schools, parks and economic development. That's a better deal than Wood Village.)

Alexandra LoBianco is that rarity, a soprano with the velvet-covered steel in her voice to take on the big Verdi and Puccini roles.

The stories of abuse include workers in Missouri being injured on the job and going without adequate medical treatment because their employers didn’t buy workers’ compensation insurance; employers requiring workers in Alabama to rent crowded apartments so shabby that they resembled “pig sties” while the trafficking schemes’ leaders lived in a $700,000 home with an air-conditioned doghouse; and women illegally working in a Tennessee motel paid so little that they were “dying of hunger.”

Of course, a lot of those tangents are funny and enjoyable. We get to see Fassler, a charming and understated actor, do some of Rudner's best jokes as a standup comedian. She contrasts nicely with Abrams, who makes Ursula's sweetness and goodness of heart seem like unshakeable traits, even when she's relentlessly climbing Hollywood's ladder.
The draw kept the Timbers (7-7-7, 28 points) in a tie with the Stars (7-9-7, 28 points) for third place in the USL Conference. The Timbers got a point, but the tie extended Portland's winless streak to four games.

Best new-wave revival act: Yes, everybody's still doing it. I expected to hear more heavy rock, or funk rock, or roots rock, but at the hippest parties, it was all "I Melt With You" rewrites with a little "Red Skies at Night" thrown in. Zola Jesus was no exception, and at her well-received set at Club DeVille, she was moving forward using all her breath, too, if you know what I mean. But Zola Jesus also had a strong, tough, deep pop voice that didn't really sound like anybody else's at the festival, and she frequently seemed to be resisting the ambient tendencies of her band. I could be wrong, but I got the strong impression that, deep down, she'd rather be Lady Gaga than Siouxsie Sioux.

It was a magical and serendipitous moment to reconnect with Paul after all those years.
While there have been tensions in the past with the frats lining the rest of the block, they currently get along well with the neighbors, Lehnen said. There does seems to be a flow of harmonious energy winding its way up and down and around the 100-year-old house. You might even call it groovy. But only three bathrooms for 29 young adults? Really?

The sweetness in the corn masa, plus the raisins, call for choices with a bit of sugar, no surprise considering that one traditional accompaniment for tamales is the sweet masa-based drink called atole. And fat in both the meat and the masa requires plenty of acid in the wine. German Kabinett or other off-dry Rieslings work quite well on both accounts. But red grapes bring weight to the dish, so consider a rosé (dry or off-dry). Even better, sweet fizzy Italian reds like Brachetto d'Acqui, Sangue di Giuda and some Lambruscos offer heady berry and plum fruit along with sugar to offset the masa, plus a lift from the bubbles. Check our Wine Selections (page F4) for recommendations. Champagne is a solid alternative, too, preferably a fruitier brut style with more Pinot Noir and a higher dosage, such as Deutz, Lanson or Billecart-Salmon.

So that was the main idea -- ramen is really comfort food -- but it is a concept that also had room for growth.

The crowning moment comes when the waiter wheels over a cart lined with rows of chocolates, bite-size pastries, wrapped candies and beautiful jewel- toned lollipops in flavors such as pineapple and watermelon. Even the subdued business executives who pepper the restaurant act like children at a candy counter as they try to figure out which to choose.

Yes, bringing the dog on vacation may have been kinder than leaving him in the kennel. But allowing him to ride inside the car would probably have been kinder than sticking him on the roof.

When I write about the mandate, I get complaints from liberals that the mandate originated with the Heritage Foundation and that it and conservatives turned on the mandate only after Obama and Democrats embraced it in the Affordable Care Act. I asked Robert Alt of Heritage's Center for Legal and Judicial Studies about that. Years ago, Heritage did advocate for the mandate, but for catastrophic coverage, not the platinum insurance plan in Obamacare. By 2006, Heritage had abandoned it as failing to provide universal coverage while being bad policy as an infringement on liberty. "It's a strange concept of liberty when government can force you to buy a product just because you're alive," Alt observed.

Last year as the state legislature debated same-sex marriage legislation, gay and lesbian couples and their supporters attacked opponents as extremists and bigots (as in The Sun's Feb. 20 article "Some Catholics support gay marriage," and Julian Bond's letter to the editor of Feb. 22). As the legislature begins to renew the debate, recent attacks on opponents were softened to "cowards." Articles on same-sex marriage frequently stir emotions and incorrectly portray the debate as either a religious or a discrimination issue. It is neither. The debate is one of challenging Webster's New World Dictionary definition of marriage as being the "relation between a man and a woman who have become husband and wife." Societies, nations, and ethnic groups throughout the world and over periods of centuries have essentially followed that definition. I am not aware of any society in the history of the world that survived by advocating same-sex marriages while demeaning traditional marriages.
