"In pink slime, we are looking at a product that is unsavory, but not unsafe -- we don't have any evidence to suggest the ammonia treatment is dangerous," says Sarah Klein, a lawyer with CSPI. "But the public outcry over this has illustrated a couple things: consumers want to know what's in their food, and the USDA needs to take a much closer look at labeling -- not just of ground beef, but of all labeling.

A strolling violinist provides acoustic effects at Restaurant Europa while orange-hued walls and copper-topped tables accent the decor. A frigid room devoted solely to drinking shots of vodka suggests a party atmosphere. The menu, meanwhile, features many Old World dishes that are likely to be familiar to native Eastern Europeans. Yet I'd venture to guess that the flavor and style of such fare will appeal to others in the county, no matter their heritage. The Russian salad, served cold, is an excellent example. A small mound of diced eggs, pickles and chicken is studded with peas and bound together with well-seasoned mayo. Pickled eggplant plays the starring role in another delicious salad served very cold and featuring tomatoes and carrots in a thick, sweet dressing. Borscht, a soup of beets and cabbage, is another fine way to launch a meal at Restaurant Europa. Stewed tomatoes and sliced carrots play supporting roles in several dishes I sampled, including the excellent stuffed cabbage. The robust dish also features good minced beef and rice encased in tender cabbage leaves. Carb-laden dishes extend to desserts, the best among them is blini -- fried bread that's stuffed with filling and rolled up in the manner of a crepe or blintz. Service is friendly and knowledgeable.-- David Farkas, Special to The Plain Dealer

Such games have grown richer and more puzzling as Johns' art has continued. The wonderful series "The Seasons: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter" (1987) marks a high point of accessibility in Johns' mature work, at least in the sense that we can put a name to almost every detail we see in them. But as the most recent work shows, the flirtation with autobiography and confession in "The Seasons" appears to have been another diversion.

But Westbrook had plenty of help. Kevin Durant was, well, Kevin Durant, swishing three-pointers, finishing fast-break dunks and wreaking havoc all over the arena floor en route to 25 points and six rebounds. And Serge Ibaka was a headache on defense, accumulating 12 rebounds and six blocked shots.

The only bitter pill the Yankees had to swallow was losing Jesus Montero, the 22-year-old catcher who has been the Yankees’ best hitting prospect for some time. In his first 61 big-league at-bats, Montero hit .328 with four home runs and a .590 slugging percentage. Scouts seem to be in complete agreement that Montero is going to be a special hitter. “He’s got lightning in his bat,” the scout said. “He could be another Miguel Cabrera.”

"I feel like these pain clinics that are able to keep doing this are no different than Doctor Kevorkian. These doctors are killing our young people for money -- that's it," she said tearfully in a small conference room at the Portsmouth health department.

Timothy Cavanagh, a partner at Cavanagh Law Group, suggests that the matter remains contentious because it is a political issue as well as a legal one. “You hear a lot of rhetoric from politicians and the chamber of commerce,” he says, “but we live in a country where the rule of law stands.”
Flip through the issues that Whedon has written or overseen, and his familiar, slangy sound comes through: Buffy, preparing to battle demons, marshals her troops. But first: "Did you bring any lip gloss? I'm all cracky." Or, Buffy, fighting her fears: "It's good. It's good. I'm spine." Or, Buffy facing down a "Big Bad," as Whedon's villains are called: "This isn't about demons at all, is it?...It's about power and it's about women and you just hate those two words in the same sentence, don't you?"

"I think there's an under-appreciation of the seismic hazard in Orange County," Grant Ludwig said. "There is a general perception in Orange County that we don't have as much earthquake hazard" — in part because the county has not suffered a major, destructive quake since 1933, when the area was sparsely populated.

More specifically, it has been awarded to a goaltender 15 times, more than any position. There is a principle reason for that. Blues coach Ken Hitchcock knows the logic well. Where success in the playoff is concerned, a "good" goalie isn't good enough. At some point, "great" has to enter the equation.

However, an Iranian bomb is not just a threat to Israel. It could destabilize the entire region and lead to a new arms race, and that's not in the best interests of the United States, Europe, Russia, China or anyone else. On this point, there's no daylight between the Obama and Netanyahu governments, nor is there any disagreement that it is unlikely that a nuclear-armed Iran could be contained through a traditional policy of deterrence.

Check for carp: Lake Erie boaters are complaining about being checked, while Ohio's U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown is complaining that U.S. Customs and Border Protection is not checking trucks for illegal loads of live U.S.-raised Asian carp destined for Canadian markets.

While the association can impose various forms of discipline on its members, there are limits to our authority. If you believe you are owed damages from the Realtor you are complaining about, that is a matter for the court system. The association does not have the authority to award damages. Also, real estate agents receive their licenses from the state through the Missouri Real Estate Commission. While the association can revoke or suspend a Realtor's membership in our organization, we do not have the authority to revoke anyone's license to do business. The real estate commission has its own disciplinary process that can result in a licensee losing their right to do business if they violate the commission's rules and regulations.

The next step?
Biggest head-scratcher: Gino Gradkowski. In hindsight, it doesn’t appear the Ravens wanted Wisconsin center Peter Konz as much as we all thought that they did. They passed on him twice and didn’t move up to select him later in the second round. Instead, they selected their potential center of the future early in the fourth. The Ravens had Gradkowski, who played center and guard at Delaware, in for a pre-draft visit, but most of Baltimore let out a collective “Who?!?” when his name was called. This looked like a reach at first, but it has been reported that other teams also thought highly of Gradkowski.
"And then doing the things to tailor my game to each surface. For example, on grass, I need to get lower because the ball doesn't bounce as high, it skids. On grass you want to be aggressive, you don't want to play long, drawn-out points. The attacking player usually wins."
For Brianna, the program's link to Cecarelli is crucial. "I don't know what I'd do without her," she said, recalling how once she spent 3½ hours on hold for a VA help line.

It really is just for a soundbite and political expediency."
Of course, there are many, many more and bigger things to be thankful for. So as long as we're on the subject, where should we start? Somebody once told me that a happy life includes "The three Fs" - family, friends and faith - and those are biggies, but I'd also add fun and food. Staying with the alliterative motif, maybe it's fried food or fast food.

Prosecuting a war against a non-uniformed, multinational terrorist organization is phenomenally complex, and we certainly understand the administration's conundrum. In a situation in which a terrorist leader poses a truly imminent threat, there may not be time to seek judicial review of a kill order. And yet Holder's definition of "imminent threat" is extremely vague, and we're not at all sure how it applies to, say, Anwar Awlaki, a U.S. citizen who was killed in a drone strike last year in Yemen. The government claims to have secret evidence tying Awlaki to past operations, but did it really have information that showed him to be an "imminent danger" in the future? At the very least, the administration should release the Justice Department memo that lays out the legal case for such killings.
The current release of the GMA, from the 2008 harvest, was made with 33 percent grenache, 33 percent mourvèdre and 34 percent alicante bouschet, yielding a wine as plush, varied and comforting as a Victorian parlor. (Two years ago, the 2007 version of the wine was named Best Red Rhône Blend at the California State Fair commercial wine competition.)
"I find Shiraz's abandonment of extremist values particularly interesting," says Niroumand, the junior from England. "It struck me as remarkable that he could totally abandon his actively jihadist lifestyle and transform into an outspoken advocate of democracy and a levelheaded critic of jihadist organizations."
"While being deposed, I described a memorial that I had helped Kruger to construct and place," Seaver said. "He wanted to put it where people couldn't bother it, but somewhere he could see every day."

Igers, The. Bob and Christine own Iger and Associates a Newport Beach lobbying firm. While a lot of people who lobby hate being called "lobbyists," they insist on being called lobbyists, one of the many reasons I like them. They also respect the fine tradition of "cocktail hour," which is another reason. Bob and I sometimes go fishing in the desert. Really. Primary dependent (besides me): Bravo, a labradoodle.
The former 'Will and Grace' star and her producer husband Daniel Zelman announced their 11-year marriage was over last December, bringing an end to a relationship that began in 1990 when they met at college.

"This governor spends a lot of time bragging about his ability to shake up government," Hester said, "so it’s time for him to back his talk and prove his worth at the bargaining table, where health insurance matters have traditionally been decided."
Dave Glenn can appreciate the change. Four years ago, in his final season of a 42-year stint as Minnehaha Academy head coach, he was hit in the face while throwing batting practice. It was the perfect storm: his best and biggest hitter, swinging the most potent bat. His broken jaw was a reminder he didn't have time to react.
The technology, which includes a programming language, is a widely used foundation for many software products.
Dear Friendship: There's a lot of room between those two choices you offer, because they represent the extremes -- refuse to get involved or get overinvolved in her choices. They also have one important thing in common: Both "forget about her" and "confront her" are punitive responses to the choices she made.

Fan Bingbing makes a brief appearance as a vengeful Chinese prisoner, but otherwise this is a strictly testosterone-pumped affair. While Odagiri's largely one-note performance is dictated by the script, Jang's lack of range negates any emotional attachment. Side characters are introduced and quickly killed off to generate sympathy, and oddly, everyone seems to understand all foreign languages except German.
My New Year's bet: Even if former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney places second, he's a victor. He's already won the resource battle. Romney is like the Southern generals in the Civil War, holding off the opposition until it runs out of ammunition. Until the Newt Gingrich surge, Romney held his fire in Iowa and focused on must-win New Hampshire. In recent days his campaign and friendly political action committees have poured millions into negative campaign ads that imploded Gingrich's rising star.

Berggruen insists that's not the case. "I've been very upfront with Michael. I've been very, very transparent. I want this to end up with LACMA, but LACMA should not be one person's efforts; there should be four or five people who really contribute to give it the depth and critical mass and texture it needs to be really vibrant. If that happens, my donation makes sense. If it never gets there, it won't," he calmly explained that day at LACMA.
"The initiative's proponents say we'll empty out our jails, but I don't have a jail full of people arrested for marijuana," Hutchens said. "It would require more, not less, law enforcement. It would create a new set of problems – more use, rival gangs, the hold up of shops."

The Chamber of Commerce is very aware of the challenges facing our city in these tough economic times. Pacific's economy, in our opinion, could remain soft for the next five or six years. Our city services will need to continue through this trough and every nickel will have to be accounted for and allocated strategically.

As former student of a number of very fine nuns, it grieves me to see members of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious treated by bishops as if they were their property.
Unfortunately, this loyalty to style also means the interior controls are there to look good first and function second. The navigation screen rises out of the dash like a carbon-fiber-topped monolith, but the Garmin system it houses is worthy of a Kmart Blue Light Special. It feeling like an afterthought is only exacerbated by the fact that none of the car's other functions (including those for the excellent 1,000-watt Bang & Olufsen sound system) can be accessed via that screen. You have to use a different outdated (and tiny) screen in the dashboard for that.
"These were the most inspirational Games I have ever seen," Romney told a few hundred people gathered in a restored historic train station lobby. He called out various teams that worked on providing food, decorating the city, finding entertainment and doing the other work that made the Games a financial and sporting success.
At a time when neither party wants to be blamed for letting students' grow larger in the middle of a congressional and presidential election year, the concerns about cost have to come to fruition. The Congressional Budget Offices estimates it will cost $6 billion to extend the rate for a single year, but both President Obama and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney have said they supporting keeping the rates low.

Masullo’s oils are usually small — some measure 20-by-30 inches; most are 10-by-8 inches — but they are all strong, bright and defy categorization. Some are stripes, some are cubist wedges, some resemble tears on the canvas or Hans Arp-y bioforms. But they have a kind of joy that only primary colors can convey and share an inventive abandon you usually see only in graphic work. The biennial continues through May 12. The Whitney Museum is at 945 Madison Ave. at 75th Street, New York City.

I'm not as interested in whether this rental car amounts to an extra benefit by NCAA rules as I am in figuring out whether Harris can save his college career. He's self-destructing in a way that tells me he's learned nothing from the mistakes of Jeremiah Masoli and Kiko Alonso.

Since then, Aloha Week has morphed into the month-long celebration of Hawaiian culture known as Aloha Festivals, which this year start Sept. 1 and include a giant block party Ho'olaulea on Sept. 17 and the equestrian Floral Parade on Sept. 24, both along Waikiki's Kalakaua Avenue. Although the Royal Court wears ancient Polynesian and Victorian-era dress, you'll note aloha fabrics in the cowboy shirts worn by the male riders in the parade, and spot a number of aloha shirts in the crowds as well.

Looking over that list, it's clear that there are few consensus players who emerge as the clear choice for any defensive awards. Buehrle, the St. Charles native, is one. Gardner sure appears like he should get some run as the best defensive left fielder -- which is a little like saying the left fielder who should be playing center. Jackson stands out as perhaps the best center fielder in the majors. (Aside: Bourjos was second in the majors to Jackson with a plus-24.)
But there are older artists here, too. Red Krayola, the Texas rock band (founded in 1966, thank you very much) is performing, and one gallery is actually devoted to a dead artist, Forrest Bess, who died in 1977. Bess was a regular at the Betty Parsons gallery from 1949-67, but his day job was bait fishing off the Gulf coast of Texas; he’d met Parsons in ’48 and charmed her with his art, paintings, mostly, with some collage. Bess had some unusual ideas about sexuality that he thought his paintings illustrated, but Parsons would never let him explain those theories in wall texts. So the Biennial has given Los Angeles artist Robert Gober (he of the realistic clothed human leg sticking straight out of the wall) an entire room to finally give Bess his full due.

Without Allen there to say so, we are left to infer that Allen fired Cho because he considers himself to be the actual general manager of the Blazers, with Cho or Pritchard or whoever else holds the title doing his bidding. Or, we are left infer that Allen simply wants a buddy with whom to bond over basketball, to share constant text messages with (as Allen used to with Pritchard).
Now, Oregon will tell you that it believes it has the greatest talent pool around. But the Ducks -- who haven't had a first-round selection since Jonathan Stewart in 2008 -- don't. And what we've learned in the past three seasons by watching the success on the field fail to translate into high-caliber NFL picks is that Kelly doesn't need all the best players to win big. He doesn't even need a half dozen of them. He just needs some pretty good football players, and maybe, a small number of guys who have a chance to play in the NFL someday.
Though, perhaps it is easier to explain what this is about by explaining what it is not about.
"There's different guys on our team - (tight end) Randy McMichael comes to mind, who played with him in Miami - who might be a lot closer to him.

The country is only 110 miles wide at its average width, but stretches 2,700 miles long, more than half the length of South America. It is surrounded by natural barriers: the ocean to the west, the Atacama Desert to the north (the world's driest desert), the Andes Mountains to the east, and the Patagonian Ice Fields to the south that claim a part of Antarctica. Soils and topography are deep and diverse. The barriers make Chile virtually free of pests.

The project is in an area where state and federal scientists are studying elevated wintertime air pollution, which has at times increased ozone levels to nearly double the limit considered safe by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Now Cleveland voters have a chance to continue the momentum for reform by turning out another deeply flawed jurist with a golden name: Municipal Court Judge Angela R. Stokes.

That's why all four Judge4Yourself groups rated her unqualified.

Several states, including Florida, rewrote unemployment laws to tighten eligibility and make it easier for businesses to challenge an employee's right to jobless benefits.
Back when shakes cost 15 cents, Biff-Burgers dotted the Southeast. It stood for Best in Fast Food. They had drive-in service and walk-up windows, they had "roto-broiled" burgers topped with a closely guarded secret-sauce concoction. Now, it appears, there's only one Best left. Burger King may be responsible for the near-extinction of Biff-Burger, but St. Petersburg's George Musser stayed strong. His location still has the original Biff-Burger neon sign; the menu runs to barbecue sandwiches, burger baskets and soft serve; and on Friday nights the parking lot fills with hot rods and their devotees.

I flew from Tokyo to Frankfurt on Feb. 3 and could feel the Dreamliner differences. My contact lenses didn't dry out as much as they usually do on long flights; same for my nose. I only slept an hour, partly because a nearby infant wailed several times during the night, even though the Dreamliner is supposed to lessen air-pressure pain in babies. Still, I wasn't dragging as much as I usually am after sleepless overnight trips.

SHOPLIFTING, NORTH COURT: An Akron woman was arrested April 17 for shoplifting items from three different North Court Street stores. Police arrested the woman at Kmart for allegedly stealing shoes and bras, worth $36.97, from the store. She admitted to the theft and said she had a ride to the store.

Remember, the Bobcats traded Gerald Wallace to the Blazers (when Cho was still Portland's GM) for three players no longer with them, and they traded Stephen Jackson on draft day. So their two best players from 2010-11 -- when they had a chance at a playoff berth before the Wallace deal -- are gone.

Q: The government deficit in Greece is 12.7 percent of the nation's annual economic output. That's not much bigger than the U.S. deficit compared with our own gross domestic product. So why are investors so much more worried about Greece's fiscal health?
When you are stationed in the Pacific, you can't help but become so aware of the role of the Navy and the Coast Guard in World War II, with the attack of Pearl Harbor and all that followed and the significant contribution the Coast Guard made with the landings on the islands in the Pacific.

Jerry Sandusky, 67, faces criminal accusations from 10 young men who claim he molested them when they were boys in his home, on Penn State property and elsewhere.

Pools on the road to Hana: As you can see from this list, I prefer the lush, rainy, green parts of Hawaii. The twisting, slow road to Hana on the eastern end of Maui passes by several pools fed by waterfalls. It’s an idyllic swimming hole for the adventurous able to withstand the cold. The pools come with their own dangers – slippery rocks (my wrist once took a whacking), waterborne illness and sudden flash floods that can turn a gentle waterfall into a thundering torrent. At least look, even if you don’t touch.

Start by removing the front of the unit, unscrewing the sides as needed. The first step is to clean the thin spongy filter. Remove the filter. Wash it in warm, soapy water and set aside to dry. Now move to the exterior fins on the exterior of the unit. These need to be cleaned at least once per year. Dirt gets in fins and doesn't allow the heat from inside the house to escape. Use a clean paint brush to loosen and remove any debris. If the fins appear dirty and greasy, your local home improvement center or hardware store sells a foaming cleaner that can be sprayed upon the fins and coils. The blast of cleaner will reach your coils, and the detergent will remove buildup. Make sure the unit is off. Spray the fins with the cleaner. The detergent does not need to be rinsed.
As the clock ticks down on November's elections, lawmakers realize that if they don't reach agreement on extending soon-to-expire Bush-era tax cuts, nearly all their constituents back home will get big tax increases.

But Spoden noted that assessing a drought is largely subjective, with difficult-to-pinpoint origins and varying effects. Had the recent dry spell occurred during a growing season, he said, it "would have been mentioned among the great droughts in history." Instead, because much of it happened during winter, local governments were pleased by how much money they weren't spending on snow removal.
State law says police can use deadly force to protect themselves or others from what they "reasonably believe" to be an imminent threat of death or serious physical injury. No Multnomah County grand jury in recent memory has indicted an officer in a fatal shooting. How reasonableness is interpreted is based on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Graham v. Connor, which held that the reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged "from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight."
That woman's case has been referred to police in Shaker Heights, which is where that accusation occurred.
* I asked Fisher if the free-agent miss means the Rams are more inclined to grab Oklahoma State wide receiver Justin Blackmon. Fisher said the Rams have been doing their work on Blackmon, and called Blackmon an impressive prospect. But Fisher downplayed the Rams' interest, which is understandable. No one knows if Blackmon will fall to the Rams' spot at No. 6 overall. And if the Rams are inclined to trade up to get Blackmon, it would be silly for Fisher to drive up the price in advance by raving about Blackmon in media interviews.

Like many places these days, Avalon, long a seaside favorite of the well-to-do, isn't seeing a a lot of home sales, period. But those that have occurred have been high enough in value to push the median price up 321 percent since 2005, an Econsult Corp. analysis of transactions in 13 Shore zip codes in Atlantic and Cape May Counties from April 1, 2005, through June 30, 2011, shows.
Most of the defensive line will be back. Co-defensive coordinator Derek Mason can't wait to get high-powered end Kevin Anderson (out of Palo Alto High) onto the field, and fellow freshmen Lance Callihan and Anthony Hayes will compete for playing time with several veterans. The problem could be the secondary without safeties Delano Howell and Michael Thomas. The coaches love freshmen Lyons, Ronnie Harris and Jordan Richards, and safety Ed Reynolds will be back after missing the year with an injury.
Houses with dreary urban facades covered in polka dots. A traveling dollhouse made from the remnants of abandoned homes. A dilapidated residence covered in ice.
Shocking? Maybe. But eventually, scouting and style of play catch up with everyone in the NBA, and coach Monty Williams and the Hornets got the game to their preferred snail-like pace, and Lin had to contend with a bigger point guard in the 6-foot-6 Greivis Vasquez, who had 15 points and 11 assists. Also, despite having the worst record in the West, the Hornets are starting to play well -- the win was their third in three games.

We’ll save the why and focus on the how, beginning with rookie Jacquian Williams’ trying for an interception instead of making a tackle on what wound up being a 24-yard catch-and-run for Jermichael Finley. Jordy Nelson then caught a 27-yard pass to the Giants’ 29 on a double move past former Packer Will Blackmon and Jennings caught a quick out for 18 to set up Crosby’s field goal.
Authorities said Patrick Smith of Hackensack, N.J., was driving south on the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx around 3:45 a.m. today when he was hit by a car going northbound in the southbound lanes. The 42-year-old was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.

It is not a student's fault if he or she is being shuttled from one parent or grandparent to another, has no time or place to do homework or is never encouraged to read. But it is not the teacher's fault either. The very best teacher who can jump through hoops while tap dancing through a lesson will never inspire a child whose home does not value education.
Since 2001, Tinariwen has been one of Africa’s top exports, earning such famous fans as Robert Plant and U2 guitarist The Edge. A collective of Touareg musicians from the Sahara in northern Mali, Tinariwen plays a raw, hypnotic “desert blues,” an organic 21st-century hybrid driven by electric guitars that connects nomadic Africa with the West. A protest band at heart, the group hasn’t bent its native vision to pop interests. But Tinariwen’s fourth album on the World Village label — produced with grit and beauty by Frenchman Jean-Paul Romann, an original intimate — boasts an array of textures, from bone-deep electric grooves and moon-lit acoustic reveries to ecstatic, ululated chants and the U2-like grandeur of “Ere Tasfata Adounia.” The CD comes with a bonus DVD featuring a wonderfully atmospheric half-hour documentary on the Saharan sessions.

Just over five minutes into the game, Chris Stewart had an open net in which to deposit the puck. But in a moment that typifies Stewart's snake-bit season, he knocked the puck toward the empty net only to have Columbus defender James Wisiniewski clear the disc away at the last possible instant. Television replays showed the puck was maddeningly close to being across the line when intercepted by Wisniewski's stick blade.

When the dog disappeared one day, about four years ago, no one hurt more than Willey's eldest, Alex, who was about 14 at the time. He had gotten close to the dog, taking him on long walks through Baltimore.

When it comes to the wine-chocolate interaction, "Some people don't like the bittersweet, the yin and the yang; it's too much for them. Other people love it." This sensation is heightened with milk chocolate, which is much sweeter and thus considerably mellower than dark chocolate. Minimizing that contrast and balancing the sweetness levels is what ultimately makes a pairing work, says Burke Owens, Copia's associate director of wine.
