The second is to find a phrase that deflects people gently. "It's a long story (smile)" works on many levels: It's true, apparently; it's a cliche, thus a proven, innocuous way of saying "Get out of my face" to people with any social acuity; and it sets up your next deflection of tone-deaf people who keep pressing (''I'd rather not tell the story, thanks").

It is extraordinarily difficult for people to think beyond the dimensions of the everyday; synonyms for minute are inconsequential, insignificant and trivial. This clouds thinking.

Hill, who oversees the menu at Picco as well as at Bix in San Francisco, adds elements of finger food kitsch to both menus. Picco's mini truffled cheese burger is hands-down the top seller on the small plates menu. Hill says Americans just love burgers and fries, so it's definitely a sentimental offering.

The 36-year-old model is also asking the judge in his custody war with the Golden Globe Award-winning actress for $500,000 in attorney's fees.
A topic like motherhood is at once totally universal (most women eventually become mothers; even those who don’t have had a mother at some point) and totally individualized (no two people feel quite the same way about the institution). As a result, it’s spring-loaded for maximum controversy. In any case, I wrote not so much about motherhood but about the nature of the rhetoric that surrounds it. As for readers who suggested this was a subject on which only mothers were entitled to an opinion, well, they’re entitled to their opinions.

A: Hey, David: I agree with your last statement. I've been fortunate to hold this job for 27 NFL seasons and it never gets old (except the losing). My game days typically are 12-hour days, from about 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. for 1 p.m. games. I usually file a pregame blog an hour before kickoff after visiting with Browns officials and those with the visiting team, and checking in with visiting scribes. During a game, I blog after every quarter. After that, it's down to the locker room for interviews with the coach and players. Then I'm back up in the press box to write a game story and analysis, followed by a video recap with colleague Mary Kay Cabot. Depending on deadlines and the city, sometimes a road game is followed by a mad dash to an airport. NFL travel is ideal. Usually we arrive in the city of the game on Saturday afternoon and return Monday morning. When I first started, I usually got out of town Sunday night, but those flights now are largely unavailable.

Tying the loin is best done with two people. Cut 8 pieces of kitchen string, each about 18 inches long. Fold one half of the loin over the other, holding it tightly together. Tie the loin snugly with string every inch or so. Tuck the remaining sprigs of sage under the string. If you have a loin with skin, score the skin every inch or so, cutting through the skin but not into the fat. If your loin is skinless, place it fat side up (there will be a little fat on all roasts) and drape the bacon or pancetta over it, tucking the edges underneath the roast. Place the loin on a rack in a roasting pan with skin or fat side up.
Webster's sentencing has been scheduled for July 26. Prosecutors are seeking a maximum of eight years in prison.
It was becoming a pretty expensive restaurant to sustain. We kept having to bring up the prices, and I was more excited about working with a small restaurant than running a big restaurant as a chef-owner. With a small restaurant you're more in touch with your clientele, you know more about what your guests want and appreciate and what they don't want. So it was more attractive for me to go back to that.

The spread of the mussels in Europe has been linked to the importation and commercial cultivation of Asian fish.

Edward Kennedy was fired by the AP in 1945 after he became the first journalist to send a firsthand account of the surrender in Reims, France, that he and 16 other journalists witnessed. As a condition of seeing it, they made a pledge to keep it secret for a time, as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Harry Truman had agreed to suppress news of the capitulation for a day. That was to allow Russian dictator Josef Stalin to stage a second surrender ceremony in Berlin.

The core ingredients of a Veloute are flour and butter in equal amounts, with a proportionate amount of liquid (broth, milk or cream, even wine). But keeping the lumps out always has been the problem. This mix assures that no lumps form because the butter and flour are already incorporated. Works like magic every time! Make it ahead and keep it in the refrigerator - in mine, it is simply labeled MAGIC and draws curiosity when anyone happens upon it tucked in the back corner waiting for a recipe that needs a basic white sauce, as many do.

Plan at least a day to explore Sossusvlei; many travelers come halfway across the world just to see these dunes. Hot-air ballooning is a pricey but memorable way to capture their magnificent geometry from on high, or you can take an airplane flight to see not only the dunes but also the historic shipwrecks along the Skeleton Coast.
-- The European region list contains a surprising and disproportionate number of entries for the quaint British seaside resorts of Torquay and Llandudno, along with quite a few in Eastern Europe, Greece and Turkey.

Some of the miscalculations date back at least 15 years.
That's an interesting argument, but it's irrelevant. The Supreme Court ruled long ago that companies can't fix prices just because they're worried they can't survive otherwise. If the Justice Department has evidence that Apple and the five publishers — Macmillan, Simon & Schuster, HarperCollins, Hachette and Pearson — colluded on a plan to raise the price of ebooks, it's right to seek a remedy.

“It’s a very complicated medical issue,” Irsay said. “I think there are a lot of things that get lost in the shuffle in terms of really looking at the situation. And one of the things is just you haven’t seen this in an NFL quarterback at all. And when you try to consult doctors literally worldwide in terms of what are the expectations, what are the dangers, the risks, the aspects of coming back from it. No one can give a definitive answer because it’s one of those things I know where even some of the doctors said that if this ever came up again then it’s going to be something people are going to rely on as trying to have some sort of historic reference medically to look back on.”

The key witness for the prosecution is former Edwards aide Andrew Young, who detailed the illicit sexual relationship in "The Politician." He has testified about an elaborate scheme to move money to Hunter. For example, according to the Los Angeles Times, an heiress wrote checks to her interior designer — in one case, for $100,000 with a note on the check saying it was for an antique table. The interior designer endorsed the checks over to Young's wife, Cheri, who signed the checks with her maiden name and deposited them in their personal account. Money was then diverted to Hunter.

My idea would be to have Roger Goodell dressed in aerodynamic Under Armour gear and launching himself out of sprinter's blocks to make his announcements.

Researchers have yet to collect enough data to come to any conclusions, but the experience of French beekeepers casts doubt on the theory. France banned the most commonly used neonicotinoid in 1999 after complaints from beekeepers that it was killing their colonies. French hives, however, are doing no better now, experts said.
On the Big Ten teleconference, Meyer denied that the "Circle of Trust" even existed. "There are things like Circle of Trust that … once again, I don't know the intent," Meyer said of The Sporting News story.

"There will be no easy off-ramps on this one. We need to keep the pressure up to compromise, not turn off the pressure," he said. "The only way these spending cuts will not take place is if Congress gets back to work and agrees on a balanced plan to reduce the deficit by at least $1.2 trillion. . . . They've still got a year to figure it out."

Obama’s only expanded that.”

The song may begin with a man "walking all alone in the Southern rain," but, Costner said, the key line comes when the angels "left no one and placed no blame. The Civil War was about placing blame, and pointing fingers, and revenge, and you see that going on today all over the world," whether in the Middle East or Central and Eastern Europe.

"We came up with approximately 50 different design ideas and then quickly narrowed the list down to 10," says Douglas Wahl, one of the students. "Some would have been too difficult to construct, and others proved not to be workable."
"When I was younger I would have paddled right out and gotten smashed up, but when you get older you get wiser," says Craig Zabransky, a travel writer who seeks out surf spots everywhere he goes but counts himself as no more than an intermediate.

"Everything about this is a home run, especially the freshness of the ingredients," Bruce said. Agreed.
Now, unless I misread those articles over the last six years about the so-called preparations of Afghans to take on the Taliban, Afghan nationals have neither the will nor the courage to resist them. That would be the same Taliban, the Islamic hard-liners, in whose dictatorial hands that nation remained mired in medieval thinking and "justice" when NATO forces went in 10 years ago. And now the U.S. engages in talks with them, disingenuously stating its belief that the Taliban will become civilized enough, or at least law-abiding enough by Afghan standards, that they can live in peace and harmony with their more moderate countrymen. Fat chance.

She transferred to the Jr. League of Summit, joined Calvary Episcopal Church and took theatre trips to NYC with the Fortnightly Club. At 93, she moved to a retirement community in Manchester, NH where she lived for six years before residing with her daughter, Rosemary in nearby Hollis.
But things seriously drag after intermission. It seems Taylor, despite her fantastic feat, was a “humorless bore,” something LaChiusa depicts all too realistically. “Must it take so long?” she complains from her deathbed -- a sentiment sure to be shared by the audience.
"I don't know if we're quite prepared for the attention we're going to get," Baginski said. "I think people are interested in seeing where he eats, seeing where he gets his hair cut."

Meanwhile, Oxbow Carbon, a major coal and petroleum supplier that gave Restore Our Future $750,000 last year, now says its contracts to sell fuel to the federal government are through a sister company that is a separate legal entity — an arrangement that allows it to skirt the prohibition on federal contractors making political expenditures.
Much of that gas will be produced through "unconventional" methods, including hydraulic fracturing or fracking -- the pumping of tons of water and chemicals into the ground to break open rock formations and extract the gas.

WXOS surged to a huge listenership lead in sports-talk radio's target group, men ages 25-54.

Worst of all, the grand statehood initiative is likely to produce nothing tangible for average Palestinians, other than the loss of their jobs. There will be no Israeli withdrawal, no stop even to the expansion of West Bank Jewish settlements. No wonder that resistance to the Abbas plan has been steadily growing: Not just the Obama administration but the Jordanian government, Hamas and Abbas' own prime minister have made it clear that they regard his initiative as foolhardy.

• Although the problems weren't all on display on Sunday, both the Knicks and the Heat have obstacles that need to be addressed before the playoffs, Ken Berger of CBSSports.com wrote: "There's plenty to worry about between now and then, for both of these teams. The Heat, because of who they are and the target they adorned themselves with when James and Chris Bosh joined Wade two summers ago, have more problems than a 42-17 team should. They started the game with no true center (Ronny Turiaf, shocking as it may sound, was hurt) and are still in the infant stages of utilizing a lineup that features no true point guard for long stretches. Despite their record and talent, Miami just doesn't carry itself like a team with any confidence -- which happens when your two best players, two of the most unguardable open-court players in the league, do little else besides launch low-percentage jump shots... The Knicks? There's no telling. This was the third time the Heat have faced them this season, and it was quite literally the third entirely different Knicks team they've faced. The last time the old '90s rivalry was resurrected, it turned out that New York was in the dying breaths of Linsanity. The Knicks got clobbered 102-88 in Miami on Feb. 23 and won only a single time in the next seven games before coach Mike D'Antoni resigned because he couldn't get through to Anthony."

I spoke at length with the girl's family, and I don't believe they thought the inserted text was intentional. I can also say I've never seen any other evidence of immature goofing around with copy in The Star's sports department. People are too busy for that kind of thing  and again, it was correct in the version that printed first. But it was definitely one of the more unfortunate errors I can recall in my years on the job. I sent the family a nice full-color printout of the page with the proper text as a keepsake.

Over the past four months, the Rams have made great strides in improving their pathetic public image from the Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight to a franchise that people can believe in. Everywhere around them, they see organizations getting it right. The Cardinals winning a World Series; the Blues returning to the playoffs; Missouri making a big splash into the SEC; and St. Louis U. basketball becoming a legitimate topic of our athletic conversations.

There, more than a 100 residents came out to the council meeting, creating a kind of town hall-like meeting that strayed from normal council meeting protocol. That fact, combined with feeling as though Wallace did not give the council enough notice of her presentation, caused some frustration from council members. When Wallace was adamant the presentation was just part of her report, accusations of playing politics came from both sides of the aisle.
But while K-pop has a lively Internet presence, America lacks a dominant media hub for first encountering K-pop culture. If one emerges, it might the Culver City-based Mnet. Its cable channel, a division of CJ Entertainment, is heavily focused on K-pop and broadcasts a mix of video countdown shows like "M! Countdown," "Jjang!" (a celebrity gossip show) and "Hello Pop!" (a social-media-themed show whose 21-year-old host, Chrissa Villanueva, is L.A.-raised and Filipina).

Stewart said the situation could be a repeat of the early 1980s, when the city laid off much of its police force only to see dramatic increases in crime.
Anyway, I thought the noise was louder on the West side than the East side – but don't tell anyone. After about 10 minutes on each side watching men intensely gazing up at the morning sky with cardboard triangles/Verticalometers in hand, it hit me. I was the only women at either location. Geez, were my girlfriends right? Was this a waste of makeup and just a "guy" thing?
"Certainly as a young black American boy who had grown up in the church, the arts were connected to my family," he said.

Animosity toward the U.S. is on the rise because of the heavy U.S. presence in Iraq. Our projects in Iraq function to serve our interests, such as building and training security forces to keep the Iraqis in check (building the infrastructure for the promotion of democracy has taken a back seat). We have made sure that Iraq, for the foreseeable future, will depend on us for security equipment and spare parts, heavy industrial machinery, and banking. We built Iraq's security forces but made sure it has no air force. And the half-hearted democracy we built is a shambles; graft and corruption are still rampant.

This same boy hasn’t whiskers on his face yet, but he thinks now that he made a mistake — this barely four years after. He surely did, for he is overgrown, and he would be ashamed to pick up the threads of school work again with those younger and smaller than himself, and the chances are that he does not possess force and persistence to take the studies up himself.

The symbolism would be too depressing — state history in hock — and the mansions do retain some practical value. Foreign business visitors were always wowed by the stateliness of his Harrisburg residence, said Edward Rendell, former governor of Pennsylvania, who happily lived there during his tenure. Thanks to dinners he hosted there, he closed a couple of business deals a year, he estimated, recouping the house's operating costs and then some.

The backdrop of armored troop carriers matched Obama’s message of praise for U.S. forces who fought and died in Afghanistan, but it was an odd fit for what followed — a direct appeal to American optimism and self-interest in an election year.
"It's a little like asking, 'Which writer today best sums up the African American experience?'" he wrote in an email to the AP. "There is no such thing as a monolithic African American experience and I don't think there's a monolithic American mood regarding 9/11. And even if there were one today, it's not the same as the mood in 2002."

Sarah Sayeed, who lives in the Bronx, said that for a long time, she hesitated before going out on the anniversary.

Maria Menounos' year: 1988. She was 10 years old. Her parents, Greek immigrants, were janitors cleaning nightclubs in Boston and took Maria along so they wouldn't have to pay a babysitter, said Menounos, starting to cry, and recalling how hard her parents worked. Her rumba to a slowed-down Material Girl with pro Derek Hough was oozing with sensuality. At one point, Maria and Derek were horizontal on the ballroom floor. Did they kiss? They sure came close! After the dance, Bruno praised Maria. Carrie Ann called her an "exquisite dancer." And Len said it was "a mix of the ballroom with a touch of the bedroom," and liked her technique.

As a result of this quest, Japan has become the most culturally cosmopolitan country on Earth, a place where you can lunch at a bistro that serves 22 types of delicious and thoroughly Gallic terrines, shop for Ivy League–style menswear at a store that puts to shame the old-school shops of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and spend the evening sipping rare single malts in a serene space that boasts a collection of 12,000 jazz, blues and soul albums. The best of everything can be found here, and is now often made here: American-style fashion, haute French cuisine, classic cocktails, modern luxury hotels.

Grant is from Virginia, an area that Buckeyes don't often draw players from, but Fickell hopes Grant will help change that. He said players of Grant's ability without any connections to Ohio State may only choose the Buckeyes one out of 10 times, but that ratio is worth the effort.

Evans ties all this together with verve and understated passion. The tone of this work is factual and precise, but the enormous horrors break out through the adroit use of powerful phrases. This three-volume masterpiece will, alongside Ian Kershaw's two-volume biography of "Hitler," serve as superb accounts of this dreadful part of history.
Or it may stem from a hodgepodge of past practices. After all, the quaint remnant of the "table wine" designation - once meant for wines between 11 and 14 percent alcohol - lives on. Most European wines were shipped with labels that indicated them simply as "table wine," enough that Josh Jensen of Calera chose to emulate language from his favorite Burgundies in his inaugural 1975 vintage. Even then, the term was losing its meaning.

Ridley-Thomas, by contrast, would be far more likely (than Burke as well as Parks) to require business to heed community concerns and keep up its end of the social contract.
Named in part for its near-West location at 2800 Clinton Ave., the address should sound familiar. For decades, this snug brick building housed Traci's Italian restaurant, followed by Halite, of blessed memory. Most recently, Ilona Simon's Budapest Blue presided here briefly. There's a lovely souvenir of her occupancy in the deeply saturated indigo walls of the restaurant. Now, with the blue walls, the glamorous glow of the vintage Art Deco bar and the genial Mr. and Mrs. Lynn -- who work the barely 50-seat room like old-fashioned impresarios -- it's an intimate club environment with live music.

"He could run a 4.6 and change in high school. People laugh when I say he was a wide receiver, but he was a difficult match-up for cornerbacks. He didn't become a defensive end until his senior year. We had played him as a strongside outside linebacker on a 4-4 defense."
A question: Had the situation been reversed - had it been the mayor's nephew lying at death's door - would the Chicago Police have put the investigation on hold for more than two weeks?

This Porsche feels more stable and predictable than an older 911, with grip easier to find. Some will see this as a loss, as indeed this 911's polish comes at the expense of older versions' more raw and kinetic predilections. I'm fine with the trade-off; seek out Porsche's Cayman R if you want a truly raw experience.

The USSF, in the hope of resolving the dispute, gave the two sides seven days to find common ground.

"People feel like in today's game you can insert a running back into the game and he can run for 200 yards without even knowing what to do," he says. "They think if you tell some of these guys 'Just go that way,' that's all it takes for them to produce. But I was never that guy. In high school, I had to learn a lot in a hurry. I never played defense and my coach asks me to play defensive back. Now he's asking me to play running back, kicking, punting, I had to learn more than anyone else. So once you start something, that's all you know.
It was classy of Phil Mickelson to go out early and watch Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player tee off to start the Masters. In 2002, our splendid golf writer, Tod Leonard, and I went out there to watch Sam Snead (who would die a month later) tee off. The Slammer's slice slammed a patron right between the eyes, but it didn't faze Augusta's green jackets, who paid no attention to the fallen man and rushed to shake Sammy's hand. Classic …

"Hi, my name is Sandra Fluke and I am a Georgetown University law school student. I testified before Congress that sexually-active young people were suffering financial harm without a federally-enforced insurance mandate that would compel religous institutions to pay for birth control for students. I was shocked and stunned when I heard about those ugly remarks from conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh and shame on him. Fortunately the President recognized the severity of his attack and called to offer encouragement and support. He thanked me for speaking out about the concerns of American women. These attacks are unacceptable and no woman should go through what I have."
Bring towels, plastic bags and rags. These are great for the camera treks around waterfalls and rivers. When the falls are roaring in spring, everything gets wet, including your camera gear. Some cameras and lenses are sealed better than others against moisture, but none are totally waterproof.

Unfortunately, the heat is not a welcome subject with wines. Questions about summer storage have been coming up from readers in the past few weeks. In short, because wines seriously dislike heat, light and "power," it would seem that Arizona is the worst possible environment in which to store them. Yes, it is, but there is a way.

Lee's co-conspirator, Edariel "Riddic" Melendez went to trial and was convicted in both killings. In 2010 Melendez was sentenced to 94 years in prison for the two murders and other counts and will be 102 years old before he is eligible for parole.

-- Regardless of the date, the inaugural New York-London 707 trip would have been an overnight flight. I'm not sure when daytime eastbound transatlantic flights started, but they surely were not the first. Still, call that lapse "dramatic license."

Last year the 41-year-old shelved his well-paying technology job to start Cafe Velo, a business predicated on Portlanders' infatuation with made-to-order coffee, farmers markets and cool bikes. He bought a $6,000 bakfiet, a heavy-duty three-wheeler made in the Netherlands, and rigged the freight box for easy conversion to a coffee counter with a couple of workhorse camp stoves and a smart black awning. Customers responded enthusiastically to Velo's pour-over, single-origin Stumptown coffee (six to eight varieties typically are offered) and to the company's green ethos.

You can't help but feel for the people impacted by the tornadoes that recently struck parts of the midwest, Raleigh, and here at home in Pulaski. I've heard some people say it is a sign that the world is about to end. While covering the aftermath in Pulaski, I interviewed a woman from a local church who believes the scriptures indicate the end is near. There are also billboards around the Roanoke Valley saying Judgment Day is coming May 21st.
Navitat Canopy Tours, where I was, opened in July in Wrightwood, about 11/2 hours northeast of Los Angeles, joining a handful of other zip-line courses in Southern California. It offers a 31/2-hour airborne tour of the forest. The course, designed and installed by Bonsai Design Inc., looks like something out of a "Berenstain Bears" book. Curved tree branches form neat stepladders that give way to pristine rope and wood bridges. I half expected to see a bird alight on someone's shoulder and begin chirping out a Disney melody.

The Totonacs, endowed with an abundance of water and fertile land, grew a wide variety of crops. One of the most important was cotton, which they used to make armor. After their conquest by the Aztecs in 1480, the Totonacs were forced to pay tributes of cloth, fruit, vegetables, honey and even slaves. Cortez' great good luck was to encounter the Totonacs first of all Mexico's native people; they were only too glad to mobilize their considerable forces to help the Spaniards defeat the Aztecs and establish North America's first European city at today's port of Veracruz.

To give you a sense of scale, the price Google was rumored to be offering Groupon last week before it was turned down was more than 50 times that of FeedBurner, the last Chicago-based tech company to be acquired by Google ($100 million in 2007).

That means streamlining the traditional methods of triage and reserving beds for only the sickest patients, abandoning the longstanding rule that every patient gets a bed. It also means staffing the ER with less-costly providers such as nurse practitioners and physician's assistants, so more expensive ER doctors can focus on care and not on paperwork, test ordering and discharge plans.

The legislation died in an odd procedural way. The bill's Senate supporters withdrew a bill previously passed by the House _ against which Schaaf had erected a blockade _ then brought up a similar Senate version and capitulated to Schaaf's demand to attach a referendum clause that would have let voters decide on the prescription database in the November election. Senators also approved various other changes to the bill, reducing the types of drugs that would be tracked and the length of time the information would be kept in the database.

"Voyage" focuses on Michael Bakunin, well before he became the fiery prophet of anarchism.

The parody of militant anti-whatever-it-may-be-ers is made funnier by the parents' target for banning -- an album by Mike and the Mechanics. Another, equally full-of-himself parent stands up to tell Fred and Carrie how wrong they are, and to defend Mike and the Mechanics as a "prime example of mid-80s pop." The debate isn't about whether it's right or wrong to ban something, it's about whose musical tastes are better. When the preschool teacher tries to join in by saying she likes the Clash, Fred, Carrie and the Mike and the Mechanics defender unite in turning on her for the artistic crime of only knowing the Clash's poppier hits, not their early, punky stuff.

"As we have said numerous times, the Kings' long-standing position has been that the team would be a tenant in an arena owned by the city and managed by AEG," said Kings spokesman Eric Rose.

But civilians who had nothing to do with the Taliban or Al Qaeda also die in these strikes. Calculations of how many vary widely, from fewer than 30 since 2008 to more than 700 just last year. The Pakistani government restricts access to the tribal areas and has only nominal control there. Militants seal off attack sites, and victims are buried quickly, according to Islamic tradition.

You didn't have to own a single share to feel the pain. That is because Apple, the largest public company in the U.S., now makes up more than 4% of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and almost 18% of the Nasdaq-100. On some trading days, Apple alone can determine whether broad stock indexes are up or down. On Monday, for instance, the Nasdaq fell 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which doesn't include Apple, rose 0.6%. On Friday, Apple fell 2.5%, sending the Nasdaq down 0.4% even as the Dow rose 0.5%.

All of this talk about originality and quality is partly a studio response to the closing over the last two years of art-house divisions like Paramount Vantage and Miramax.

(The organization also runs Skin Deep, www.ewg.org/skindeep, a website that showcases data on various cosmetic and personal-care products.)

I don’t think this has anything to do with altered crowd response, either. Some people tweeted me throughout Smackdown last week saying the crowd reactions they heard on TV during Daniel Bryan’s breakup with AJ were very different from being live in Orlando.

The gimmick - a good one - at EdgeWild is positioning Andy Kohn as an American version of a negociant, the middleman in Burgundy who buys grapes or juice and produces his own cuvées (blends). Kohn buys from producers in California, Oregon, Washington and Missouri and private-labels the wine, ostensibly allowing him to provide wine similar to some of the better names in America at much lower prices. I tried the Sonoma Coast Reserve Pinot Noir, which was more Burgundian in character than I expected, as opposed to fruit-forward, but was a decent value at $44. Nothing on EdgeWild's wine list is more than $46, and most are under $30. Guests who sign up (at no cost) for the restaurant's wine club get $5 off bottles.

THE BUSH FACTOR
Nearly every elected official in the country pays homage to small business and its importance to the economy. Unfortunately, government regulators seem to believe that small employers can never be trusted to do the right thing for their employees. This is unfortunate, both for the country and for those employed by small business.
I tweeted this earlier: former Bears offensive coordinator Ron Turner has shown an interest in getting his "foot in the door" in the Giants' search for a new QB coach to replace the "retired" Chris Palmer.

"That's a good hands-inside approach," said Holliday, who ranks among Molina's influences as a hitter. "The guy hangs a breaking ball a little bit and (Molina) catches it out front with good spin instead of being early and topping it. He caught it and was able to pull it without hitting it on the ground. That comes from how well he's hitting the ball the other way on fastballs. He's in a really good rhythm where he keeps his hands inside the ball. He's pulling pitches for power. Last year and this year he's been a very good hitter."

Throughout, nine dancers dressed in yoga pants, bright T-shirts and hoodies orbit around Jones, executing 60-second increments of choreography that invoke both balletic technique and uninhibited modernity. One minute, duets and trios of dancers bend and swing their arms, semaphore-style, parallel with their lunging legs. The next, a dancer stands on another's shoulders and falls backward into the ensemble's outstretched arms. Later, men rolling across the stage encounter a woman and man performing unabashedly naked. Pulled in 70 directions, Jones' finely trained, fully committed dancers move as one, matching each other's intensity and fluidity with beautiful consistency.

How times have changed.
Dampness and hunger finally overcame us all as we headed back to the cabin late in the afternoon. I cooked dinner and we sat next to the wood stove and watched a movie on the laptop. One can never be far from electronics of one kind or another these days. An orange glow – uncharacteristic of the day, which had been mostly gray – beamed through the window. The clouds and fog had parted slightly, just in time for sunset. My daughter and I quickly threw on our coats and made our way down to the beach, crossing the expanse of sand nearly a quarter of a mile wide due to the low tide, and watched as the glowing sun made a brief appearance just beneath the fog bank before slipping into the Pacific Ocean. A deep orange glow surrounded us as we walked back across the beach. It had been a perfect ending to our trip to the coast.

"By the time I shot 'Frozen River,' there was some forward momentum in this ol' career already," says Leo. " '21 Grams' made an enormous difference and people had started to hire me."

Thats what America is all about. When our assembly lines grind to a halt, we work together and we get them going again. Dont forget I got my start standing with working folks whod lost jobs and hope when nearby steel plants closed down, because I didnt like the idea that they didnt have anybody to fight for them.
