Once caffeinated, you're ready for your first detour, heading about two miles west to Carmel River State Beach, which is actually two gems in one setting. Birders will want to bring their binoculars to the north end, home to the Carmel River Lagoon and Wetlands Natural Preserve and great blue herons, among other species. Experienced divers head to the kelp forests at the southern end, known as Monastery Beach, but anywhere on the mile-long strand that's at a safe distance from the strong undercurrents is a sweet spot to soak in the views.

The Five-Year Engagement gets draggy here and there, and there's a tendency to veer into the land of cute (the flashbacks to Violet and Tom's costume-party first encounter are replayed, and replayed again).

I can't imagine that this measure has been properly thought through; I and most of my friends and family (who I questioned) re-use the plastic bags as trash bags; so how does it make sense to ban plastic grocery bags, when people like myself will just have to go to the grocery store and buy "plastic trash bags"; the same amount of plastic bags will still end up in landfills. – Darlene Ashley, Encinitas
Intel did not rely on new incentives included in a job bill signed this week by Gov. Jan Brewer when deciding to expand in Arizona, executives said.

The Oshman Family JCC looks like a fortress and sends a strong "keep out" message to folks on the outside. And the development on El Camino Real at the old Hyatt Rickey's is equally forbidding. These bare walls remind me of some of the housing in northern Germany, where I lived many years ago.

I think that the rail authority must be preserved, at least as a role model for the other government agencies. It must be given reasonable financing and some easily done duties, such as generating one new project a year. Of course, there is a risk that some hot head in the authority will try to start building a real railroad, but I am sure this person will be rendered harmless by the forces inside the rail authority. Nobody with good sense cuts the branch on which he sits. And until now, the rail authority has demonstrated an astonishing self-preservation instinct.

When Claiborne came out of high school, the schools that recruited him knew he had a learning disability. I don’t know much about his disability other than it has to do with reading. Everyone I have talked to tells me that Claiborne has great character and is a great kid.

In saying that, Claiborne’s test score was NOT a true indicator of his intelligence. He can and does learn.

“Well, I know Cory Booker understood that having the Nets in Newark was temporary, and I think the results were mixed — in large part because the team was not performing optimally on the court,’’ Silver said. “But Newark did everything it promised to do; it’s a fantastic arena, and while there’s no NBA team looking to relocate at the moment, I think Newark demonstrated that it has viability as a stand-alone market in the NBA.”

FBI Agent Michael Massie testified today that when the halfway house's county funding was on the chopping block, Kelley approached Dimora for help.
City Administrative Officer Mike Brown said the shortage of parking downtown has been a problem for years.
Barry Bonds always will be a Hall of Fame candidate. He surely is one of the 10 best players of his generation and probably several others. But will he be a Hall of Famer? That is a question I don't have to worry about answering for another three years or so, until he would become eligible. The biggest question of all, though, may be how would the Hall of Famers receive Bonds if he were elected?. My guess is not very well. American is a forgiving nation but Bonds, and for that matter, Roger Clemens, have shown very little if any contrition for their actions or suspected actions. That creates the sense that they feel they are bigger than the game. And they're not.
It looks as if Lozano -- who until recently played Téa Delgado on the soap "One Life to Live" -- couldn't make up her mind as to what to write about, or what tone to adopt. So she checked the "all of the above" box.

The Hillsboro nonprofit spends about $700,000 each year to run the 27-bed Monika's House Shelter, Washington County's only emergency shelter for those fleeing domestic violence; to operate a 24-hour crisis line that answers more than 2,000 calls a year; to help victims file for restraining orders and otherwise navigate the courts; and to run outreach and education programs in schools.
Bienville got in on the ground floor of this operation  he was as avaricious as he was ambitious  and in time rather arbitrarily chose the site in the crescent. There were difficulties galore  the chief one being the river itself, powerful and unstable, hard to enter at its mouth, harder still to navigate, because of its currents  and there were other prospective sites that may have been more feasible, but Bienville stood firm.

The third-youngest coach in major college football, older than only USC's Lane Kiffin and Northwestern's Pat Fitzgerald, Fickell may or may not be the long-term answer for Ohio State, but he was the clear answer for now when Jim Tressel resigned two weeks ago. OSU athletic director Gene Smith announced Monday that Fickell got a raise to $775,000, a little more than one-fifth of what Tressel was making.

For years, I wrote to the sound of tango music from the '20s and '30s — Don Barreto, Roberto Firpo, Ada Falcón and, of course, the king of them all, Carlos Gardel, who died in a plane crash in 1935. Not that I'd ever been to Argentina at that point: I just loved the music. And when I moved to L.A. and found a restaurant named for the singer near West Hollywood, I had to try it. That was 1996, just after the Bozoghlian family from Buenos Aires bought the place and turned it into one of the most welcoming, and festive, restaurants in town.
In a statement e-mailed to The Associated Press, Breitbart said: "We have no knowledge about or connection to any alleged acts and events involving James O'Keefe at Senator Mary Landrieu's office.

The Buccaneers haven't dropped 10 in a row in a season since opening the 1977 campaign under John McKay with 12 consecutive defeats. Guaranteed a few weeks ago to miss the postseason for a fourth straight year, the Tampa Bay players have only themselves to feel sorry for after gaining much hype following a 10-6 record in 2010. The Buccaneers have a solid nucleus of players to work with, and it just didn't come together for some reason this season.

Social Security expenditures exceeded the program's non-interest income in 2010 for the first time since 1983, and were projected to do so again in 2011. But reserves in the system's trust fund are projected to continue to grow through 2022, covering any annual cash deficits. After 2022, trust fund assets would be sufficient to cover full benefits until the reserves are exhausted in 2036, according to annual reports. Thereafter, tax income would be sufficient to pay only about three-quarters of scheduled benefits through 2085.

Though it's admirably focused on regional brands — Flying Dog, DuClaw, Brewer's Art — the beer list is stingy, with just five drafts, and three by the bottle.

The project will be completed in September, but it is not unusual for legislation on a medical issue under study to be introduced before the conclusion of a project, said Stephanie Clendenin, acting director of the department.

It is the unapologetic "older generation" here -­­ Joe's sharply defensive second wife, Vera (MaryAnn Thebus in crackling good form), and his now well-to-do best friend, Morty (Mike Nussbaum, beyond perfection, in what seems like a custom-made role), who easily steal the spotlight here. They explain that what seemed right at a time when it was Soviet soldiers in the forefront of the fight against Hitler and fascism, may look very different now.

"I feel like normally the way we talk about politics is very argumentative, like on 'Crossfire' — 'Oh, the war is good' or 'Oh, the war is bad,'" Johnson said. "I wanted to suspend that question, even though it's an important question.... What I hope for the movie is that it does something the expression of an opinion can't do, which is to ask you to feel certain ideas in a different register."
“We’re an attractive city and the staff we have in place is professional and top-notch,” she said. “But I fear that if things don’t change with the council we won’t be able to attract the caliber of city staff and participants in city government that we’ve all grown accustomed to.”
Under the McCain plan, companies could no longer deduct the cost of providing health benefits to their employees. Instead, everyone would get a tax credit -- $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families -- that could be used to purchase individual insurance policies.

Still, there are things to enjoy. Means (the son of Russell Means) overdoes it a little -- the whole film could be said to suffer from trying too hard, as with an odd sequence involving over-enthusiastic security guards -- but that's part of Buddy's personality. First-time actor Donathan Littlehair is entertaining as a somewhat-clueless WWFA chapter president. And Johnny Greybird is funny as the slightly cheesy master of ceremonies.

Athletic director Gene Smith has said Tressel never notified him, his Ohio State bosses or anyone in the university's compliance department.

Rarely will someone reply "What exactly do you mean by 'God?'" But research shows that more and more people are thinking about God, and changing their beliefs. One of my teachers told a story of being at a dinner party. When he was introduced as a rabbi, another guest said "Well you know, I don't believe in God." The rabbi replied, "That's OK, I don't believe in the same God you don't believe in."
Egypt's military ruler, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, has hinted in several public comments in recent weeks that the powerful military would not allow the Brotherhood to dominate the country, a response to what is widely seen as the group's hunger for power after 60 years operating illegally and subject to government crackdowns.

The The Spa of the Rockies offers pedicures as well as massages and baths that use the world-famous mineral waters that feed the hot springs pool. (Courtesy of Glenwood Hot Springs)Hotel Colorado (526 Pine St., 800-544-3998, hotelcolorado.com) has retained its old-timey feel (it was built in 1893), and its location puts it perfectly between an easy walk to downtown Glenwood or the hot springs. The rooms are spacious in a way that hotels rarely offer anymore, with plenty of walking-around room and furniture that's comfortable without being overly bulky, and they have "family" rooms with adjoining sleeping rooms that share a bath. The lobby is pretty and encourages sipping a latte from the in-house coffee shop, and be sure to have at least one nip at the little old bar tucked off to one side.

She is nervous about Max's surgery, because there are risks with any surgery. But she knows that if he should ever change his mind -- though she doesn't think he will -- it is reversible. And the only other path -- forcing Max to continue being a brutally unhappy Makenzie -- wasn't an option at all.

Asked about Gabriel’s penalty, Portland general manager and head coach Mike Johnston said: “I think Gabes when he went back for the puck was thinking Cheveldave was going to move left, so Gabes went right and he ran over him.

Perot became a caricature, thanks to his own erratic behavior and comedian Dana Carvey's devastating portrayal. So it's easy to forget that in May 1992, the Texan led both incumbent George H.W. Bush and Clinton in the polls.

Dan Greene, an attorney for one of the activists, said that while it's common for defense lawyers to file this type of motion when they believe such a violation has occurred it is highly unusual for judges to grant them.
It's what Allen's done to Pritchard here. And it's curious, considering all the regret the Blazers once blathered about when the organization gave up on a young Jermaine O'Neal.

Instead, an English-only bill is touted as the quickest way to help immigrants succeed. If that is the case why aren't the same good intentions a ringing endorsement of the Maryland Dream Act? Why wait and hope to see if any of these shiftless immigrants will wise up and learn English in Anne Arundel County out of brute necessity when the students who could benefit from the Dream Act have already demonstrated enough English proficiency and good conduct (i.e. paying taxes and applying for citizenship) in order to justify receiving a modest college tuition break?
The Vikings signed veteran quarterback Donovan McNabb last season. McNabb will no doubt go into the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame someday, but he was benched first by the Washington Redskins in 2010, then the Vikings last year.
