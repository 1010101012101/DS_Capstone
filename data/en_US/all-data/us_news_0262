Remember in New Jersey a couple’s assets (except for half of the joint assets up to $109,560, which the community spouse is permitted to retain) must be spent down prior to receiving Medicaid. However, this approach is sometimes faulted.

At the time, flamboyant uniforms modeled on the French Zouave units that served in North Africa were in style, with baggy trousers and fez hats.
What’s striking now about the finale is how, sadly, it’s not just classic but old-fashioned: the quaint idea of acting honorably, of putting duty before pleasure. And that’s what "Casablanca" is really about. It’s not just the story of a lover finding the woman he’d lost. It’s the story of a cynic rediscovering himself.

"The elite's fear and loathing of the tea party movement is rooted in the recognition that the real change is only now coming," writes Tony Blankley, the conservative commentator who exempts himself from the elite label even though he worked for the speaker of the House and now toils for a prominent PR firm. The Tea Party, he wrote, will "constrain the elite's economic and cultural hegemony."
It's been a labor of love. Miller coaches club water polo in the offseason too. He still gets in the pool on occasion and whips the ball around with the best of them.
OR … fill the cavity with quarters of onions, oranges and apples, plus fresh herbs (parsley, sage, thyme). Stubborn about stuffing? Bake it in a dish while the roasted turkey rests before carving.
In 1894, the section of land just south of the Winfield Scott property was bought by Rhode Island banker Albert G. Utley. He planned to subdivide the 40 acres on the northwestern corner of the property into a town site he planned to name Orangedale. It was changed to Scottsdale. -- The Arizona Republic ________________________________________________________________________

The Environmental Protection Agency announced that it will draft standards for fracking wastewater -- the briny, chemical-laced water that comes back out of the well -- that drillers would have to meet before sending it to treatment plants. The industry in recent months has been recycling much of the wastewater or injecting it deep underground, but some of it is sent to plants that are ill-equipped to remove the contaminants.
"They've happy in Venezuela," said Gomez.
The other study, of some 120,000 adults from two nationally representative surveys between 1972-2008, finds that parents were indeed less happy than non-parents in the decade 1985-95, but parents from 1995 to 2008 were happier. What's happened, suggests co-author Chris Herbst of Arizona State University, is that happiness among non-parents has declined, thus making parents happier in comparison.
However, companies developing solar-power projects worry that tariffs on inexpensive Chinese imports—whose low price helped fuel last year's record level of solar-energy installations in the U.S.—will lead to higher-priced equipment and choke growth.
—Police on the night of Aug. 5 allegedly found “a large amount of marijuana” in the backpack of a juvenile arrested in the area of South and Boulevard avenues.
Today's meeting, scheduled from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., is private. The reason for the secrecy, according to an e-mail from MetroHealth sent to The Plain Dealer, is that "trade secret matters" will be discussed. Ohio's Sunshine Law does allow county hospitals to meet in private when talking about trade secrets.
Legal experts had predicted prosecutors may file more serious charges like manslaughter and second-degree murder. The Champion family said they were disappointed.

MANSFIELD — A 19-year-old Washington man was arrested on warrants out of Mansfield Township and Washington Township totaling $1,650 on Monday, April 30, police said.
Yet you won't read much about who gave to whom, or how much, or be able to sort through the reports today. The Senate will not send them over to the Federal Election Commission, which makes them public, for days if not weeks. This may be the age of electronic transparency, but when it comes to disclosure, the Senate is a decade behind.
A lack of interpersonal harmony defines percussion-heavy tune "The Bad in Each Other." Life imitated art when Feist opened the stage to audience talent, only to have a self-absorbed piano player overstay his welcome.

The Cleveland School District was the first urban district in the Midwest to establish a universal breakfast and lunch program in 1999. Of the 52,000 students currently enrolled, 83 percent are eligible for free or reduced meals - meaning that, under federal standards, their family incomes are at or below 185 percent of the poverty level.

Officers do end up at times far from their cars. Quintero says he chased a guy on foot nearly two miles when the man bolted after causing an injury crash. Quintero's partner had to tend to the injured parties, so Quintero had to march the handcuffed suspect back to the car.
A trio of it's-hard-to-see-out-there e-mails arrived in Road Rant's inbox from the western 'burbs within a few days of each other earlier this month. What happened afterward is a bright spot in today's report.
Fincher has tightened up his pacing, and the reward is a thoroughly entertaining film. (It helps that Sorkin often packs three minutes of dialogue into a one-minute scene.)
A. No, you're going into the world of it. It's seeping into your pores. We were looking into the particular denial that is the benzene of high capitalism -- I'm driving into the curve here, but there's something deeply inhuman about all that wealth and the way in which it's predicated upon denial. You have that in the scenario and in the heart of it you put this depth charge of love. When Emma tells her husband she loves Antonio, he says to her, "You don't exist."

I'm not sure who created that clever little quote -- I heard it first from Charles Barkley -- but it does seem appropriate.
As we sat down in "the box," a small, closet-like room with a high director's chair looking out into the kitchen, I got my first glimpse of this world-renowned kitchen. I wouldn't be allowed inside until the next day, yet even behind glass, I sensed differences between this kitchen and other four-stars where I'd staged, or trained, previously.

To critics, KPMG, the auditing firm hired to conduct the investigation, also is ill-equipped to offer an unbiased perspective. The school district paid KPMG $1.7 million between 2002 and 2008, records show. Most recently, the firm audited the performance of the district’s public broadcasting operations.
Titanic’s “watertight” compartments in reality were no such thing — they were open at the top. So as the forward ones filled with water, they spilled over into more compartments, quickly hauling the vessel downward, nose-first. When the water level reached open hatches and portholes, the process accelerated — and with the stern of the ship still buoyant, gravity began to bend the hull in half.
It's dangerous but common. In St. Louis alone, police process dozens of warrants a day for the arrest of people wanted for anything from ignoring a court summons to murder. When the risk is considered high, the officers seek assistance from the U.S. marshals, who add expertise and firepower.

First, get the budget deficit under control. That includes increasing tax receipts, cutting government spending, reining in entitlements -- these are all going to be necessary first steps to redressing the profligacy of the last six years. Doing so will reduce aggregate demand and hence imports. It'll also reduce the necessity for issuing so much federal debt, and at the same time make us less vulnerable to the whims of the PBOC and other state actors in the international economy.
So far this year, five people have been blacklisted. Last year 19 people were excluded and nine were recommended for exclusion. Cases for those recommended are still pending. This year, 17 people have already been recommended.

A malfunctioning streetlight prevented drivers from spotting a curve in the road at Winslow's address, leading to tires on his turf, he said. Road Rant relayed Winslow's worries to the folks at FirstEnergy. The next day result? "The street is illuminated again," Wolfe e-mailed, and nobody is dropping in unannounced anymore.
State Sen. Shannon Jones, a Springfield Republican who was a panel co-chair, acknowledged that the budget study committee fell short of her hopes. She said, in retrospect, that perhaps her hopes were too high for an election-year panel tackling thorny budget issues.
Some city and state officials said they are hopeful the race would continue, citing ticket sales that exceeded initial projections. But they warned that the race organizers needed to balance their books — and quickly.

Rob Dauster, NBCSports.com: "On the one hand, the addition of Temple - which is being made immediately because the Big East needs to add another football member - helps the basketball side of a league that is losing Syracuse, Pitt and West Virginia in the very near future. Throw in the addition of Memphis, and Big East hoops may not drop as far as we initially thought. It is, however, a major blow to the Atlantic 10. Temple, along with Xavier, is probably the best basketball program in that conference right now. Losing the Owls will hurt a lot."
Valerie Stuart, Ian's mom: Valerie is still working two jobs, and her family's move to Rocky River has been both good and bad. Youngest daughter Margo is able to walk across the street to Rocky River High School, and Ian can take the bus to St. Edward. But a majority of friends of both children still live in their Old Brooklyn neighborhood, so Valerie finds herself shuttling them back and forth often. She's still hoping St. Ed will find more financial aid to help with expenses.
The task force itself also has had low turnout at meetings. The group of attorneys, community leaders and former police began in April with 45 members, but about 20 attended the latest meetings.
Do the performances portend good stretch runs for either player? Lets not over-analyze it. They each contributed to a big win and would love to get some meaningful minutes again Tuesday as the Cavs host the Toronto Raptors.
Of course, it's the hottest thing since Harry Potter, so I guess I'll have to go see the movie this weekend so that I can remain relevant for at least another few weeks. I'm guessing Project X is more my speed, since it would probably remind me of my troubled youth, but I have to admit that the title of this thing intrigues me.

Union chief executive officer Nick Sakiewicz said the team had no concerns that the Bimbo name could hamper jersey sales to women.
* See, Kroenke gets to have it both ways. He can maintain a strong NFL presence in London by having the Rams play a game there each season. And he gets to enjoy all the benefits without having to put up with all of the hassles of actually having a London-based team. The Rams can become "London's team" (sort of) without actually moving there. Kroenke gets to sell merchandise, possibly media rights, and market the Rams as a satellite London franchise ... and he gets to do it from a safe distance, largely removed from the complications. Does this mean I rule out a Rams' move to London? Not at all. Only an imbecile would rule anything out at this point.
In recent days, Policetti's case took a dramatic turn when an attorney for Policetti's alleged victim indicated to Cook County prosecutors that she was no longer willing to pursue charges — a decision that would effectively force prosecutors to dismiss the case and abandon the years-long extradition effort.

A report in the Detroit Free Press a week ago showed there are more than 3,000 structures near Denby that need to be razed. Some students said their classmates are scared to walk by houses that are abandoned because of the danger many pose such as being drug houses or places where crimes like rape may take place. Everyday it causes fear, Wilbourn said.

More and more visitors, surfers and landlubbers alike, are finding their way to Pleasure Point. It's a small, close-knit community where a goodly percentage of the population begin their days on the waves instead of the freeway. Nonsurfers get that Beach Boys vibe without (much of) the attitude surfing cliques are notorious for, along with plenty of low-key - dare I say mellow? - diversions to round out their days.
Union negotiations are considered the cornerstone of any plan to save the city from financial ruin.
The portrait painted of Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Facebook, is often scathing but also, at times, sympathetic. Despite Zuckerberg's misgivings, it is likely to do little harm to him or Facebook with its 500 million users and an estimated value of $23 billion. Indeed, it could make Zuckerberg something of a hero in a tech world where being brusque, dismissive and self-absorbed are not necessarily bad things.

With the clever format and careful food preparation at State Bird Provisions, you'd think the wine list would be equally well crafted. But it's as if the owners ran out of energy and simply amassed some wines and threw them on the list, misspellings and all.
Now, it's really fun for the Gazelle Group, the tournament organizers, who -- after three rounds of anticlimactic but largely entertaining basketball -- have the most appealing matchup:

Dye, who pleaded no contest last month, must serve two years’ probation after finishing her jail sentence.
Thus, even though the Mavericks don't have the most attractive package to land Dwight Howard, look for Cuban to somehow rope in other teams to land The Big D in The Big D. Cuban and Mavericks basketball chief Donnie Nelson did the right thing by letting Tyson Chandler walk and setting the Mavericks up for future moves. Most assumed those would be in free agency. But Cuban and the Mavericks also have been active in the trade market in the past. Look for Dallas to pull the upset.

"Anyone who is already behind on their mortgage payments, and is therefore much closer to actually losing their home, won't benefit," said Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.

And then he added: "What a way to go out."
the economy must generate at least 100,000 jobs each month just to keep up with population growth and prevent the unemployment rate from rising. And economists say the gains need to be at least double that total to drive down the rate.
The county approved a $382 million budget last month that had to plug a $36.5 million hole. The combined union efforts kept dozens of jobs off the chopping block and reduced the number of county workers laid off July 1 from an estimated 200 to about 60, helping avert what could have been the largest round of county layoffs in years.
Why it could stay open: Parma recently got new stamping equipment from a Michigan plant that closed, and its workers were among the first to approve union contracts that relaxed work rules.
Curators are understandably picky about what they'll take, and the museum's underwear interests tend toward the antique and the exotic - like 19th century corsets and inflatable brassieres. But they also are looking for good examples of more everyday items of more recent vintage - like padded panties, 1980s shoulder pads and a Wonderbra or two.
Friday the 13th seems to be a good day to write about the Titanic-- not just because we find the number 13 creepy but because the cruise was then underway, 100 years ago, with not a hint (at least, not to the passengers) of trouble in sight. It was the most luxurious ship of its day -- a fact that it certainly didn't try to hide. Indeed, some would say the boasting about the megaship -- remember, they said it was unsinkable -- may have tempted fate. Meanwhile, we'd like to tempt you to take this quiz and find out how much you really know about this maritime nightmare. There are 15 questions and a bonus. Bon voyage.
"Evita" received poor reviews when it opened on Broadway in 1979. Some critics lambasted it for glorifying the wife of a fascist Argentine dictator, Juan Perón. The show regained some critical currency when it later won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for best musical and seven Tony Awards, including best musical and one for its star, Patti LuPone. Rice now says of Eva Perón, "Some days I think she was a pretty nasty piece of work and, on the other hand, she had some pretty good points about her. It often depends on who's playing her."

I tried to go a few more times after that September visit, but whenever I logged on to Farmshop's site in the morning to see that evening's menu, it was beef. Or more beef. Or roasted chicken. The beef always sounded similar to what I'd already had. And how exciting could roasted chicken be? I kept trying, and then one day they added an à la carte menu. In addition to a half-dozen first courses and several main courses, anything on the prix-fixe menu is available à la carte. All right! It just became possible to bring those friends who don't want to be told what to eat.
When I was growing up, the go-to football party food was seven-layer dip. Which is basically the same thing as Frito pie -- layers of Fritos corn chips, chili, cheese and other toppings.

"He knows my character and what kind of person I am. I'm very excited about the opportunity to get out to Colorado and getting a fresh start. It was tough to get kicked out of school, but I'm going to finish up and then I can't wait to get out to Colorado and start that new chapter of my life. Hopefully, people won't judge me and will give me the same second chance coach Embree did. I'm not going to blow it again."

You can have it both ways  a solid savings plan and the ability to buy the things you want  in moderation. But first you need to pay yourself. Give yourself the peace of mind and the control of your financial life that only a solid savings plan can offer.
