I was meditating a while back and all the sudden saw very clearly that for many of us our house is not a home. For some our place of residence is more like a prison. And, I am not talking about the home that I bet you are thinking about. No, no I am talking about your body! Your body is the temporary home for your soul while here.
So I continue to push congressional leaders for the largest possible deal. And there’s going to be resistance. There is, frankly, resistance on my side to do anything on entitlements. There is strong resistance on the Republican side to do anything on revenues. But if each side takes a maximalist position, if each side wants 100 percent of what its ideological predispositions are, then we can’t get anything done. And I think the American people want to see something done. They feel a sense of urgency, both about the breakdown in our political process and also about the situation in our economy.
So I think I have to change the world. One stupid, fucking stereotype (read: one wrong impression) at a time, and for that I'm going to need a whole other platform, one that will involve a lot more preaching, a little less swearing, and a lot more love.

LUXURY LIFE
I did nothing more for, as best I can remember, about a fortnight. Now, I know a novel is not like a rare gemstone but I felt like I was poised to split a diamond and terrified that I was going to mishit the thing and it was going to shatter into a thousand unusable pieces; into diamond dust. "The tale is told of Joseph Asscher, the greatest cleaver of the day, that when he prepared to cleave the largest diamond ever known, the 3,106 carats (621g) Cullinan, he had a doctor and nurse standing by and when he finally struck the diamond and it broke perfectly in two, he fainted dead away."[1] It’s pure myth but that best describes how I felt: everything depended on what I was to write next.
I love, love, love that moment.
I think we were tired when we went to The Hill that day, but I can't really be sure. I just remember this brief moment in time, one that passed way too quickly, and now it feels so far away even though it was just a few weeks ago. Time is tricky like that.
Okay, I am a little indecisive. But it's not even about that. It's about the way I categorize books.

Forgive my play on words! I’m just a tad bit tired from a flurry of activity and lack of sleep. When I get tired, I tend to get somewhat silly, sometimes almost extremely so. Once, after a long 3 days of working double shifts as a cashier and hardly any sleep, I even did an Edith Ann impression and skit for a few of my customers. Yeah, I know. Some of you probably don’t have a clue who Edith Ann was. That’s ok. You can google just about anything these days, you know. LOL! Anyways, I promise not to go into my Edith Ann rendition here.
Hamlet reverses the usual spiritual practice of the memento mori; instead of the skull’s making him less materialistic, it makes him more so; it shows us that even gods among men such as Alexander and Caesar are just mud. He uses the skull as a symbol of the shallowness of even the most profound human matters. He makes a mockery of making a mockery of the pointlessness of human concerns. He uses the device of religion to arrive at the basest kind of crudity.

That could open the poll in the two constituencies in Tower Hamlets – Bethnal Green and Bow and Poplar and Limehouse – to massive postal voter fraud. Respect is in a bitter fight to retain the highly marginal Bethnal Green seat – vacated by Respect MP George Galloway, who is standing in neighbouring Poplar and Limehouse – and, in an unprecedented development in British politics, all the candidates of the main parties are Bangladeshi Muslims.

I am damned proud. I am proud that I took care of my mother as long as I could and as good as I could. I made a few mistakes, and I know I was criticized along the way by a few friends and family that felt I should have put her in a nursing home earlier.
That which has been feared the most, the cause of the most powerful suffering (lust to rule, sex, etc.), has been treated by men with the greatest amount of hostility and eliminated from the "true" world. Thus they have eliminated the affects one by one --posited God as the antithesis of evil, that is, placed reality in the negation of the desires and affects (i.e., in nothingness).

A career change caused me to move to another city; another time of adversity in our relationship. But we agreed it’d be in our best interest to relocate together, despite the distance it would create between him and his son, he assured me that he would adjust. After one month in our new-found town, the phone calls began again; this time to his phones as well as mine. She began to speak when she called, rather than hang up. This woman knew my name, where I worked and where I lived. She knew how many children that I had as well as the loss I’d experienced. She knew everything about me, and was determined to inform me of the stranger I was sleeping with.
The problem is, it’s only open Monday to Friday. So it took me awhile to get there.
This is not about Pink Floyd. Snow White ruined them for me a long time ago. I used to love Pink Floyd until Snow White told me they are bad luck to listen to on the radio. Upon further inquiry, I found out that she had no real good reason for this declaration which makes me believe in it even more. She is a spiritual person and I’m into karma so I just couldn’t mess with that. Which sucks because anytime Pink Floyd comes on the radio I Pavlovianly (that is a sweet new word right there) change the station. I used to love to bellow out, “We’re just two lost souls, swimming in a fish bowl, year after year.” But no more.
The incident occurred at a protest in solidarity with Palestinian political prisoners who are on a hunger strike. Khader Adnan, Hana Shalabi and several other Palestinian political prisoners undertook hunger strikes to highlight their unfair imprisonment by Israel (Israel's notorious "Administrative Detention" has often been compared to Apartheid South Africa's "Detention Without Trail")

Getting the Ron Paul is a lunatic on foreign policy point out of the way, I'd rather focus on Santorum and why I prefer him not only on foreign policy but on Constitutional and founding principles. For me, it comes down not only to the role of government but to the role of citizens in our Constitutional Republic. As such, I'm always uncomfortable with the libertarian (the near-anarchist version) view of a government so limited that heroine, prostitution, gay marriage, and who knows what else is legalized (as Paul states repeatedly, and with a nonchalant shrug, they should be).

But in case you think I am being hopelessly negative about eBooks I am not at all. I buy them and occasionally read them (in roughly the same sort of proportion as the percentage of print books I buy and then actually manage the time to read). My biggest reservation about the notion of eBook reselling as it is currently constructed in our industry is that it misses the whole point that eBooks are NOT print books and present a completely different range of opportunities to the publisher – most significantly for interaction and engagement with the customer. A possibility that is entirely lost under the eBook reselling model. (And this is why I think eBook reselling is just a first – and temporary – step for many publishers.) And in the last few minutes I’ll be looking at some examples of how publishers are exploiting these possibilities.

Ok well I have some Guatemalan Jokes and the sad part is, is that they are so true.... ¿ how many people can you fit into a bus?........ Always one more. story about that, we were traveling to Estansuela about 40 minutes away in a taxi van, and in the US you can fit 3 in a row and it’s a little squished but it is built for that, well following the joke "always one more" a bigger lady got on and the conductor tells me 4 in a row, so we all squeeze together and we muster up about a foot of space, and she is easily 3 feet wide(the hips are always wider) (I’m saying this all with respect, she was very nice) they have such faith here, I wanted to scream "are you crazy?" but following the phrase "always one more" so let’s just say that it was not a good experience it was a very long bus ride and it was hot....

To avoid public self-flagellation, I must consider that gratitude has been, at least, a fairly frequent acquaintance in my life; I have blogged as such in the past. I am very grateful for my beautiful spouse, beloved children, Mother Church, my career that provides for us all, my mind, my gifts…yet each day I receive their wonder anew. Why is not my gratitude so reflected? Why is my gratitude reserved for moments of magnanimous giving and absent in the mundane reality of existence? St. Augustine writes:
The almond powder is a pain in the a**. The ones we get here are coarse and so I had to sieve it a couple of times, then pulse it with the other mentioned ingredients and then sieve again a couple of times to get a somewhat fine consistency.

This is only the second or third time I’ve asked for audience participation in a post. The previous efforts were also met with the similar soundtrack of a solitary cricket chirping in an empty auditorium. When you’ve had several consecutive days with higher than usual number of hits on your blog as I have, it’s easy to get carried away and think that people are reading your stuff and getting you. Maybe they are getting me, but are so awestruck by the brilliance of my sarcasm that they dare not attempt a public exchange of ideas with me for fear of looking less than intelligent. I know when I comment on posts, I give careful consideration to my chosen words for just that reason. Sadly, on my award post, the response requested was basically true/false – so we can eliminate fear of ridicule as an option.
Whether you're running a race or just running around town, you should feel comfortable.
There’s nothing like a bit of leadership when your back’s against the wall. In truth, this sort of flim-flam dissembling simply irritates anyone with a brain, and makes everyone else wonder which way is up. But the most glaring thing one can extrapolate from the above is that this bloke is hopelessly out of touch with what’s happening, and what’s likely to happen: we are not going to return to anything even approaching normal within two years, and it isn’t going to be growth of a healthy kind. Our financial institutions and the lucky 7% are living in a fool’s paradise that chooses to ignore the obvious.

The real back-ground of perception is the Soul. Fleshy eyes are only external instruments for perception. Eye is not an organ of vision. The organ of vision is a center situated in the brain; so is the case with all senses. Mind is connected with the Senses, the Senses with the corresponding centers in brain and the centers, with the physical organs, to the external object. The mind presents the sensation to Intellect ; Intellect takes it to the Soul. Now, real perception takes place. Soul gives order to Intellect.

1. Traffic (both vehicular and pedestrian): Street trees make an enormous contribution to safer, more lively streets. They narrow sight lines and slow traffic down (reducing accidents and close calls), while simultaneous acting as a buffer between cars and pedestrians (as well as a buffer for traffic noise). Slower traffic and a sense of separation from it, along with the obvious benefits of shade and beauty, encourages pedestrian traffic, which in turn boosts local merchant revenues and makes streets safer (peopled streets are safe streets).
The new place, by contrast, feels bright, airy and clean; and I personally think the lack of a balcony is more than made up for by the presence of a structurally sound ceiling.

Then there's that 1997 account of the surgical removal of a candiru. In this incident, the victim (a 23-year-old man from Iticoatiara, Brazil, recorded only as 'FBC') claimed that a candiru 'jumped' from the water into his urethra as he urinated while thigh-deep in a river. After travelling to Manaus, the victim underwent a two-hour urological surgery by one Dr Anoar Samad to remove the fish from his body. In Samad's case report we read the following:
In between the women, Byron did manage some verses – Beppo, the first part of Don Juan and a part of the tragedy Marin Faliero. He also wrote quite a lot of letters talking about his poetry, and his women, including this one, dated January 19th, 1819, in which he tells his friend John Cam Hobhouse not to pay his long-suffering debtors with his publishing earnings:

I'm nearing the end of 2011, and life is less about writing sadly, and more focused on just day-to-day life. I seem to have less and less to say about writing and even the allotment is dying back for the year now, so a lot of my inspiration is hibernating.

This may or not be late news to the rest of you lucky cunts back in the States but goddammit, I just found out that a Bush interviewed a Clinton (actually, THE Clinton) about a Clinton marrying a Wall Street legacy and no one argued or called each other names or mentioned one fucking thing about how everyone involved in the story was either directly involved with causing the country's economic problems or with leading to the country's economic problems or, at the very least, related to the country's economics problems. No, wait, at the very least they could have mentioned how one party tried to ruin the other party through tenuous character assassination.

What I do know is that this young man needed something different than what he got. In the heat of the moment - whether that heat was real or merely contrived - his mother was unable or unwilling to step back, take a breath, and consider the needs of her child.
Which means that my marrying at 18 and being a mother at 19, that was qadr. I chose how I arrived there. That it involved giving up a schooling career and spending time in Daarul Uloom, that was my choice. Had I remained at school, I’d still have married at 18. Or does it?

She was so surprised, so that helped.

On first blush, this positive energy, rebirther thing has a lot going for it: it it means being conscious of your breathing, of your feelings, of your actions, your reactions and their source. Most people involved in this are all about taking personal responsibility for the things that happen to you and your reactions to it. It can be a great motivator for changing your own life. The snag comes in when the benefits of this perspective are discussed. Apparently, good health is all about having the right attitude and that any other factor is irrelevant. If you can "positive attitude" your way into good health, then any health problems you have are because you chose them.

It will also be completely unremarkable and that is a feature, not a bug.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a feeble woman who can't go anywhere without her husband! In fact anyone who knew me before I met the man of my dreams back in 2005 will laugh at the very idea. I was the most independent, single-minded woman alive who laughed at romantic couples, mocked people who referred to their "other half" and had no intention whatsoever of succumbing to what old Frank Sinatra referred to as "the tender trap". That was before I fell in love. Since then, Mr B and I spend every available moment together (given that he works very hard and very long hours during the week) and we've had some wonderful times travelling all over the country and abroad on Stonewylde events.

If I don't see it, I don't wear it. I decided to take a bunch of small nails, cover the inside closet walls and hang the necklaces from there.

Lastly, I think that the next chapter will focus on Raizel and company as well as the Union. I think that there will be a Union Elders meeting, and hopefully there will be a glimpse of the traitors who had bonded with the Union Elders. I also think that KSA will make some cameos, given that the agency will have to recuperate from the attack on them. I’m not sure if the enhanced couple will work with Raizel and company, though I think they should, given that they had become partners, in a way. And to round that chapter, there should be humor. ‘Nough said.
01. I Like the Look - Henry Mancini / 2:39
Red: In the light spectrum, red is the color that gives off the longest wave length. Because of this, it is the easiest color to see. It tends to raise people’s blood pressure, but it also increases one’s energy levels. When you use shades of red, people will tend to see you as strong-willed, impulsive, inhibited, easily bored, decisive, and somewhat over-indulgent. You may give off an air of being one to stir up action, of being a go-getter, or of having manic tendencies. This is a color to be used strategically and carefully.

Only five clubs have been operating within the 60% limit generally advocated as good practice. These include three of the so-called ‘big four’ of English football (Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United, but not Chelsea), who have the highest wages and revenues, thus skewing the average for the whole league. Just over half the clubs have wages. revenues ratios of over 70%, with worst practice at Wigan Athletic, with a five-seasons ratio of 87.5%. Among the data are some particularly worrying examples of ratios above 100% – Wigan with 100.3% in season 2006/07, Stoke with 105.9% in 2007/08, Portsmouth with 108.8% in 2008/09, Hull with 129.0% in 2007/08, and Wigan again with an amazing 208.3% in 2004/05.

Egypt's transitional regime also helped broker the odious exchange of more than 1,000 convicted terrorists held by Israel for a single soldier kidnapped and held hostage for five years by Hamas. Upon their release, the convicts with Jewish blood on their hands received heroes' welcomes even as they affirmed their desire to destroy Israel and called for the seizure of still more Israelis to spring their comrades still behind bars. This does not augur well for either the Jewish state or for our interests.

I’ve mentioned before how different we are and that it is important to find the right exercise for you. We are (fortunately?!) not all the same, so our bodies react differently to things, including exercise. So even if you are not in ‘super-responder’ category, don’t despair, just put some effort into finding out what really works for you and minimise effort on the things which don’t work! There is no point wasting valuable time with something that isn’t right for you…(a lesson for all areas of life…)
Also the only way that the 24 elders would be referring to themselves in the third person is by presupposing that the pronoun US was not there and that PERSONS was the actual original rendering. If US was there, which the preponderance of the evidence shows, then they weren’t referring to themselves in the third person, so unless you are thinking of another example, this third person argument would be contingent upon proving that US wasn’t there and PERSONS was, wouldn’t it?

In the third year of the war, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation. It freed over three million black men, women, and children and called for black men to join the Union army." Below this is a quote from Lincoln:
17 “The LORD your God is the God of gods and Lord of lords. He is the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality and takes no bribes. 18He gives justice to orphans and widows. He shows love to the foreigners living among you and gives them food and clothing. 19You, too, must show love to foreigners, for you yourselves were once foreigners in the land of Egypt. 20 You must fear the LORD your God and worship him and cling to him. Your oaths must be in his name alone. 21 He is your God, the one who is worthy of your praise, the one who has done mighty miracles that you yourselves have seen. 22 When your ancestors went down into Egypt, there were only seventy of them. But now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky!

In the Preface to the 1611 edition, the translators of the Authorised Version stated that it was not their purpose "to make a new translation... but to make good ones better." They recorded their debt to the earlier works of William Tyndale and other Reformers and Bible translators. The New King James Version seeks to be faithful to the original text and to retain the King James Version style and idiom, while keeping abreast of changes in English speech.

One of our missionary couples wrote about the situation in the African nation where they are working. One of the poorest on earth, its situation has been worsened by the long, bloody civil war there. The missionaries recently drove to this desperate country in a truck with a group of Christians from a neighboring country. They were delivering a load of supplies and were scheduled to attend a meeting that night across the border. About five miles from the border, their truck started slowing down. The driver floored the pedal, but the truck’s speed kept dropping. The team was dejected as they watched the car in front of them pull away into the distance.

Just suppose a bill is proposed in Westminster, which would 'ban the veil', would it be so narrow that it fails to preclude alternative attire that can conceal the face, for example a balaclava? I don't think it would be. Firstly, because some Muslim women would simply wear such clothing instead of the burqa, and secondly because it would be seen as discriminatory. Therefore any legislation would be broad and would essentially criminalise the covering of one's face in public, and of course that would mean that the authorities would find it far easier to identify and monitor people using CCTV. It's my belief that this is simply another step towards a surveillance state.

Yes unfortunately. I often use the example of De La Soul “2 feet High & Rising” I was 14 in 1989 when it was released on Tommy Boy. I remember that all the kids were listening to this album, it was really mainstream. 20 years after it would be simply impossible to clear an album like that, it would be underground like Edan or Madlib. So yes I really believe that those restrictions have killed a lot creativity. Personally I’ve had only once the problem with a sample but I work a bit differently using more samples like texture that I replay.
However, every time I tried, the pain almost brought me to the ground. I could walk, but I could not run. So walk I did. Until the last 1/2 mile, when I could see the finish line. I was determined to RUN across that line. Clenching my teeth, holding back the tears, I sucked in the pain and ran.
If dad and the boys were working in a field closer to home I was sent out at ten and at three with tea and a treat.

In other Rylee news, she is officially the proud owner of three, soon to be four, adult teeth. She has had her front two bottom adult teeth for a few months now and one of her top front teeth is just about completely in (look at the above pic, no more trademark Rylee gap!). The other front baby tooth is hanging by a thread while the adult tooth grows in behind it. It's only about 1/4 of the way in but I can see it's going to be crooked as it tries to maneuver itself around the remaining baby tooth. Kev and I keep trying to bribe Rylee into letting us rip her tooth out but so far, no dice. Looks like orthodontia is in the future of at least two of the Kraft kiddos!

Once that pudding is ready, spread it directly over the cake. Gently press it over the holes to help it get down inside of the cake. (This is what makes it super yummy when you serve it!) Spread it evenly over the cake and let it sit out on the counter, uncovered, to cool down. Cover it up and chill it in the fridge till you need it. I made this a little over 24 hours in advance and it stayed really well. Sprinkle the crushed up Oreo pieces over the entire cake just before serving. Serve chilled.
We also sometimes have people get unhappy with us who have written to ask us if an agent or publisher they've queried is legitimate. When we reply back with info that reflects the data we've gathered on that agent or publisher, and the info we provide is negative, they climb aboard a reed boat and push off into that big river in Northern Africa, "De Nile." "Does this mean I shouldn't sign their publishing/agenting contract?" is a response we receive all too often, I'm afraid. Even worse, they'll say, "Does this mean I shouldn't have signed that contract and paid them X amount?"

Does Barack Obama hope to be re-elected? Of course. Is he campaigning? Of course. But he is also about our business at home and abroad. The man is simply doing his job; the job a strong majority of us elected him to do. And, he is doing it very well. Those prejudiced against him may find that too much to bear. They would, if they could, deprive those of us who support President Obama of our pride in him.

And there is a risk that communal bigotry will be fueled by two further factors. First, rampant politicisation of the state machinery means that the government wants to hire/promote rank AL-ers. The thing is, a generation ago, hardcore AL-ers had a disproportionate number of Hindus — student councils of major institutions were dominated by anti-AL factions in the 1980s. This means, politicisation may be leading to a communal backlash. Second, the (long overdue) expected repel of Vested Property Act may be creating apprehension in the mofussil areas. The fear is that once the act is repelled, local AL-ers will use a Hindu front to grab prime land.
After walking around looking at huge, non-elegant jewelery and fending off the Rolex sellers, we headed to the Fish and Vegetable market. The odour just outside the fish market had me gaging, but it was OK when you got inside. There were fishes of all sorts there, small, big and huge!! We saw baby tuna, full grown tuna, sharks and eels. The vegetable stalls had practically everything you could want, except Gem Squash. We bought a box of the softest, freshest dates I have ever tasted, and headed back to the creek to grab a taxi. On our way out we came across Hammerhead sharks lying on a half wall outside. They were huge!!

‘Home’ by Yann Arthus-Bertrand
The consecutive chapters follow a similar pattern describing the grody, ambi-sexual, cheap-thrill chasing Evangelistic coprophiliacs involved in variable imbroglios, and occasionally each other’s lives. Mazelike narratives and enigmatic exchanges reign supreme, and can be as ambiguous as Morse code would for one with impaired auscultation; but add an invaluable dimension to the mockery and debunking of cultural stereotypes, pharisaical belief systems and herd-like consensual submission to the values of pseudo-democratic liberalism. The next character concerns Ginger’s mother, Francine Kafka, former drug peddler and high-priestess of half-wits. Enthused only about what speaks to the hypocrisy of her “Amurica Profundant values”, she keeps Ginger’s brother and “mommy’s number one bitch”, Rusty, in his bedroom with benighted widows, which he dare not scratch for fear of being “spanked with a shovel”, while his dormant homosexuality is evaluated by the school psychiatrist. Francine’s wrath explodes in an uproarious monologue when she admonishes Rusty by saying: “What the hell you thinkin’, that some smelly brown rectum’s your idea of paradise? Maybe I’m jumpin’ the gun, but I sure hope you is gonna make use of condoms and enemas in your adult life; there’s a fearful amount of disease associated with the ass. And even then, one can’t go round indiscriminately offerin’ one’s backside lovehole to every stranger as if him were the Royal Blue Prince.” Sound advice courtesy of mamma Kafka, indeed. Then there’s Djzheemi Sparks, a “closeted monster drag queen clown” who does his slap in the dark because it makes “more sense to him to get it wrong”. Djzheemi is a victim of a ghoulish childhood with a “paw” who spent most of his time at the “shit doctor” having his rectum examined “for cancer bumps,” and a maladjusted Queen of Shit Mountain mother. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Djzheemi is undergoing some sort of psycho-traumatic prostration and finds himself in a “subterranean chamber leading to the dressing room of Fraulein Baykalskaya’s nightclub, K Hole Slut Rehab,” where he is prepared for his impending sexual lobotomy.

Dr Martin Harris (played by Liam Neeson) is a world renowned scientist. We meet him as he arrives in Berlin with his wife Liz (by January Jones), ready to make a keynote presentation at an international conference on biotechnology. Due to a series of circumstances, he and Liz are separated when they arrive at their hotel, then Martin is seriously injured in a car accident and in a coma for four days. When he awakens, he has lost his memory and has no identification, so tries to piece his life and wereabouts back together. As he remembers details of his life and sets out to join his wife, Martin discovers that things he previously trusted are not real and someone else has taken his place - he starts to question his own identity and even his sanity. A series of dangerous incidents ensue and it becomes clear that Martin is involved in an international plot to assasinate a key conference member who is also an Arab funder of important but controversial research. Martin starts to unravel the mystery, with the help of Gretchen (by Eva Lobau) a nurse at the hospital, Gina (by Diane Kruger) the taxi driver involved in his accident and Ernst Jurgen (by Bruno Ganz) a retired secret agent - but is he who he thinks he is? Has his memory totally deserted him? What is really going on?

On top of it all I had a revelation this week that having a two year old and a four year old is mentally exhausting.

If anything, the Shirtboards are a playful ribbing of Albers. Rauschenberg was famously frustrated with Albers discipline and his rigorous formal exercises. The Shirtboards recall one such activity. Albers would have students do was arrange shapes cut from construction paper into visual experiments, so the students could push abstract forms as far as they could to understand their possibilities. In Morroco and North Africa, Rauschenberg took on these activities, turing them into vehicles for the hodge podge of life.

After finally becoming fed up with how things were in my life, I realized that if I wanted something to change, I had to change it. (Duh!) Things were staying the same because I wasn’t doing anything differently to change them. What a concept! I really felt silly after this struck me but some of us learn the hard way (and by “some of us”, I mean me). So, I began to study successful people, happy people, men and women, rich and not so rich. The one thing they ALL have in common is how they think. They are all narrow minded. They will only allow themselves to focus on the positive and see the good (or potential good) in any given circumstance. They refuse to worry about what they cannot change and with the things they can change, they don’t worry, they take action. By continuously turning their thoughts and attention on what they want rather than the things they could worry about, they effectively steer their lives exactly where they want to go.

There’s also Chef Seth Bixby Daugherty from Minnesota who has worked with -- yes, let’s give him a hand --(applause) -- who has worked with several schools across the country to design easy, healthy recipes that taste good and can be made with the equipment that schools already have.
“Claiming Western-style Democracy was unsuitable for Indonesia, he called for a system of guided democracy. The Indonesian way of deciding important questions, he argued, was by way of prolonged deliberation designed to achieve a consensus. This was the way problems were solved at the village level, and Sukarno argued it should be the model for the entire nation. He proposed a government based not only on political parties but on “functional groups” composed of the nation’s basic elements, which would together form a National Council, through which a national consensus could express itself under presidential guidance.”
All in all, I have surpassed many of the goals I had set by a long way. The only thing that has been more difficult than planned is the withdrawal process. This massive challenge I have had to face has also halted my physical recovery somewhat as, when I am struggling through the symptoms, my energy levels are no where near enough to be up and about and building my stamina and fitness back up.
It's a sweet little movie with no surprises.

So, how to do this? There are so many ways, ranging from seminars that cost thousands of dollars to webinars that are completely free. The good news is that you can write these expenses off at the end of the year, so you’ll likely get a good part of that money back. Joining professional associations such as the American Society of Media Professionals, or National Press Photographers Association is one of the best ways to start. These organizations are designed to bolster and maintain the health of the industry, and year round they organize regional meet ups, workshops, happy hours and peer review sessions geared toward helping media professionals continue to develop. Most associations offer discounted rates for young professionals and students, which makes this option even more affordable, but if you don’t have the budget to join, even checking out their websites is extremely useful. Both ASMP and NPPA offer a wealth of free resources designed to help you better run your business. So if you haven’t checked them out, take five minutes to browse their websites, I guarantee you will learn something new.

I promised you a VERY SPECIAL post today, didn't I? Here it is!
There are many different things that a person can be addicted to, but food addiction has to be one of the toughest addictions to break. Food is necessary to survival, so you can’t give it up like you can with other things such as drugs, alcohol, or tobacco. Are you addicted to food? It seems like it wouldn’t technically be possible, but research has shown that some people actually have an addictive personality when it comes to eating food.

She was beautiful and frail, very childlike but on the brink of feminist womanhood. She could be sweet and affectionate or violent and aggressive, often without warning.
Next up is to figure out the alignment for your clever cutlass. This is perticuarly important as a person can only wield one with the same alignment as themselves or they take damage every turn they hold it depending on how big the difference is. While the alignment is determined randomly there is a 70% chance of it ending up lawful, 20% neutral, and thus only 1 in ten will be chaotic so most parties will be able to use one when they find it.
It all started with replacing the toilet and sink in the hall half bath. If we were going to take the toilet and sink out we might as well take the wall and floor tile out. That meant replacing the flooring. And because we wanted the wood flooring to continue down the hall and into the bathroom maybe it was time to replace the very worn hall and dining room wood flooring.
well yeahs ok so this is my version x333 hope you like it ^^
Those at Yale who wish to indulge in uninformed cultural imperialism should bear in mind that it is not just the Republic that stands to benefit from this union, but America as well, as it takes a leaf out of Singapore’s book in the realisation that perhaps we, too, are doing something right that is worthy of emulation.

Then with my last boyfriend I was actually going to make a huge payment on some tools he’d bought. Of course, we broke up (thankfully right before I was going to pay) and I used the money to make a lot of waffles and supplies that would later leave a hole in the ground and a huge paint stain on my friend’s explorer… This past week I once again learned that if I like a guy I should never buy him a gift.
The native levy system was one which helped us conquer the Empire, the regiments so formed then going on to form the core of the post-colonial forces. And the best examples currently are the Pakistani and Indian Armies, living testament to our past military skills.

I like to set goals. I never really stick to them, but I like the feeling I get when I determine that I'm going to DO something. I feel like, yeah! This is going to happen this time! And if only for a little while, I have something to work towards. So New Year's is a fun time for me. A fresh start, a new year, a new day.
You might be wondering what these many people are doing, crowding each other to suffocation. There is entertainment arranged for everyone in the from of the famous Panchavadyam ( music from 5 instruments ) at the Elanjithara ( the foot of the Elanji tree )which gets the adrenaline pumping from the crowd. The people who play the instruments stand in front of the elephants and the accustomed pachyderms also sway gently to the vibrant beats.

And then there's the bag. Which bag you ask? The Vacation Teacher Bag(s). (Insert people clutching their hearts and screaming here...most likely these people are former teachers who are all too familiar with the scoliosis inducing wonder and horror that is The Vacation Teacher Bag.) For those of you less familiar with this phenomenon, The Vacation Teacher Bag is similar to the regular Teacher Bag that teachers all over the country routinely drag to and from their classrooms laden with assorted papers, books and educational whatnot. (The whatnot could include everything from old water bottles to abandoned paper clips, old receipts to misplaced markers, but that's another post for another day.) However, the vacation version of the Teacher Bag is MUCH MORE FULL of both To Dos and Guilt.
Yesterday we published an article titled in Greek “They cut social benefits and in England!” And the English title “#thegameagainstEngland ?”.
Still, the decision by the New York Court of Appeals was a welcome sign for defense lawyers and innocence advocates who have argued that police interrogation tactics can lead people to admit to crimes they did not commit. About a quarter of the convicts exonerated by DNA evidence nationwide gave false confessions, made self-incriminating statements or pleaded guilty, according to the Innocence Project. “That the phenomenon of false confessions is genuine has moved from the realm of startling hypothesis into that of common knowledge, if not conventional wisdom,” Judge Susan P. Read wrote in the majority opinion. An Albany Law School professor called the ruling “a big step.”
This line of attack by Obama is being criticized by Obama's former auto czar, Steven Rattner, who seems to agree that the attack against Romney is an attack against capitalism and calling it an "unfair" attack.
Betsie is absolutely the sweetest baby girl I’ve ever known. She lives and breathes to be loved, and even when she is getting into stuff, she looks up at us with her sweet little expression, begging to be adored and praised. She is incredibly tender and even the tiniest bump on the head just breaks her heart.
My longest swim was 2000 m. My most disappointing swimming moment was arriving at the pool today, only to realize that the pool was shut down for contamination. Boo!

Seven minutes with sneezing and three minutes with searching and forgetting, and it still adds up to ten minutes, which the last I saw, was a mere 1/6th of an hour, and not very much time at all.
At the very least, you should learn all you can about the registry and its operation before attempting to do anything with it. Make sure you understand the concepts. And make sure you perform a backup so you can restore your system if you should do something wrong.

I kind of lied yesterday when I said that nothing super exciting happened to me last week when I was on vacation. I actually hit a bit of a milestone. The week before vacation I put on one of my usual pairs of jeans and came to the realization that they just didn’t fit anymore. Not only that, they looked down right funny. I’m not a girl who has ever liked to wear tight pants, we learned this lesson in the Jeggings post (and for those of you keeping track, I did wear the jegging on New Years and rocked them) so my jeans are never really tight. In fact, some might say that I’ve spent most of my life running around in jeans that don’t fit. Which is probably true because of my little buns and lack of hips. It’s also true because if I wore jeans that fit, then people might actually realize that I have body under all this clothing. So yes, my jeans run on the loose side. Not the sloppy side, just the loose side.
Oh, how I love Christmas and all the super, wonderful things that go with it. I love the season, the festivities, and most of all the Reason ... my Lord Jesus Christ. :) So, today, I have a Christmas project for you. It's a gift tag. It's large, but I think it's really cool for a special gift.
Rally boosters claimed 20,000 people attended (some particularly over-enthusiastic atheists claimed 40,000 godless minions descended on Washington for the event) but the generally sober atheist Ed Brayton at Free Thought Blogs put the crowd somewhere between 8,000 and 10,000.

The only thing on my card that isn't like me is that I am actually blonde, not a brunette! I'm afraid I went for what would look better with my lovely papers, rather than how I actually look in real life! In addition, my legs are unfortunately 4 times the size of this pretty little thing....!

I've been wrackin' my brain all day trying to think up something SPRINGY and FUN for this giveaway... something witty, maybe, or just.... SOMETHING. But I am well and truly sick, folks. My brain feels like it's stuffed with fluff and my throat is roaring while I periodically try to cough out my lungs for some fresh air. Delightful.
The 2010 edition is unique because, unlike previous batches, it is 100% barrel-aged. The length of aging time ranged from eight months to three years using a blend of first-use, second-use and third-use oak bourbon barrels. Because more barrels were combined to create this batch, the cherry tartness is slightly more pronounced than in prior years, contributing to a greater overall complexity and depth of flavor.Yummy!
In Oman, I visited the souk and bought traditional Omani men’s hats (kumma). While I was browsing the designs, a couple local men stopped by and browsed, too. So, I could see that it wasn’t just a tourist destination. But the place I felt more sure about, where I was helped by local women, and knew I was supporting locally made crafts, was the Omani Heritage Gallery.
I also sense that, though she was young and single motherhood could not have been easy, Jo Ann was not in total concord with the plan.
Nathan will work for praise- especially enthusiastic clapping. However, he is not opposed to you inputting a random mini-M&M into his mouth anymore. He used to let it sit until it drooled out; but three went in yesterday and I never found a chocolatey-drool mess anywhere. That's handy- because Peter seems to suffer from "learned helplessness" quite a bit. Thus, he spends a lot of time fussing and pitching a fit when he is asked to do something for himself that he would rather someone else do for him. However, when I turn my attention to little brother and dole out mini-M&M rewards, that changes things.
No beading this week-I just haven't had time. But I really feel like I'm getting somewhere with the PE preparation. I finished a whole book of practise problems that was put out by the same people who administer the test. Out of the 80 questions therein, I missed 16, but I have learned why I missed those 16, and can now correctly solve them. I'm also nearly halfway through another study guide, which had thousands of problems in it.
Yesterday, my strikingly attractive girlfriend and I went to a very lovely pub owned by St Austell's brewery. I will refrain from naming the venue, partly out of common decency but mostly because of an irrational fear of bloodthirsty reprisals. (I am still down here, after all).

The Unite health sector was the first to announce the 10 May date. As ever, the rhetoric is far more charged and bellicose than the actual fight. Despite the headline, this doesn't "step up" the dispute except with the proviso that doing nothing since November 30 was a step down and so they are returning to where they were. Workers are clearly itching for a fight, with a 94% vote for action, but despite talking tough this is just the second day of action for Unite members in over a year since pension attacks were announced.
ANC MP and committee chairperson Sindi Chikunga ascribed the losses to a "laissez-faire attitude" in the police, "because I know if I lose my weapon, I will get another one".
We all assumed, as did the commentators, that the referee didn’t see the incident, otherwise he’d have sent Balotelli off. That was clear, it was obvious. So why would the ref say he did see it, and took no action.

I will admit that I am skeptical about the existence of ghosts, but I like to maintain an open mind. Like Fox Mulder, I want to believe; unlike Fox Mulder, I don’t automatically assume. But when I throw myself into a passion, I pursue it as if I do believe. I want to understand the mind of someone who does. I want to understand any topic from the point of view of an adherent. I want to understand.
In terms of language, I received some pieces with Canadian spelling, some with American spelling, and for the most part, that's how they were left. Also, my proofreader flaked out on me partway through, so I'm blaming her for the typos I'm sure are there! ;-P

I know that we will have many days of trials and misfires until we figure out what foods make her sick. There are going to be mistakes and constant worry. Is this "just" prediabetes in an active, thin child or is this the beginning of Type 1? Either way it is scary and uncertain. This is the area where I really need to stop screwing up because I can't keep watching my big girl get sick.

Today Princess pushed the boundaries on rest time, major. She decided she wasn't interested in resting in her room...there was lots of crying and coming out of her room. We eventually caved and rest time was skipped for today. Everyday that passes we get deeper into the "terrible two's" and hopefully closer to the end of tantrums and defiance (I can hope, right?).

She dreamt about getting two gold bananas and the meaning about this is she would receive big treasure at young age. She thought about twins at first. It was likely to be lovely daughter or if it was boy he would be beautiful and pretty like woman. He/she would be musician or get jobs relating to art. He/she would be scared of lots of thing and good-looking for both male and female. (OMG sooooo true)
If I trust you, I will let you hold my baby. Foremost in my mind is that she is vulnerable. I don't want her hurt in any way. I don't let just anyone hold her. I have to trust that you will not hurt her.
I wanted to be able to jump into the action as soon as possible, without having to worry about fragility or spells, so I knew the Barbarian would be a great fit. I typically played a Paladin in Diablo II, and tend to favor melee classes in most computer games, and I wasn't about to change here.
On the Mother's Day page, "What does your mom always say?" Abby Kate: "Well, she's kind of like, mean." Nice. I'm so proud. What's sad is, lately, she may be right. She's been in trouble a little more than usual, so my mean voice has also been out a little too much. It was a good reminder that those little ears are listening to every word...and every tone. :)

Pink Tartan is always a fun to watch as I often pass by their clothes in The Bay. It was a very typical Pink Tartan show with tailored business pieces with a couple of feathered pieces and fur jackets. One thing I did hate were the furry boots/leg warmers. It just reminded me of gogo dancers...or Snooki.

She filled her days reading and writing, having several stories and poems published in magazines, but it was to be a meeting with her brother’s professor in October 1844 that would change two destinies. Auguste Comte was the teacher, a man who was working on a monumental thesis but was somewhat lacking in direction. The initial meeting was electric and the married Comte fell instantly in love. De Vaux rejected his approaches but a friendship developed and the two became regular correspondants.

Anyway, you know that I painted my bookshelves a couple of weeks ago, and after I painted them, I just kind of threw everything back up, in an effort to clear off the floor. I had planned to go back and make it look pretty again, and this weekend, I finally got around to it.

Israel challenged the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. They challenged the witness of the Holy Spirit of their Messiah. They not only doubted His authority but they completely rejected the will of God in His choice of Paul as the apostle of the Gentiles. If you don’t know the Lord, you certainly cannot know His will.
That breaks her and finally, she slaps him hard. Thank you! I’ve been itching to do that! She starts at him-Why is he so angry at her? Why does he think she left? Didn’t he get money from Jae Hyuk? Doesn’t that make it equal? His expression twists as if in pain but he tells her to get out if she has nothing more to say. Ga Young can’t help but cry and leaves. Outside, she gasps for breath after her outburst. Dejected, she heads back. At home, she takes to the sewing machine and sews while she remembers her past with Young Gul from their times in America to here in Korea and cries.
“The only reason this balanced approach isn’t on its way to becoming law right now is because a significant number of Republicans in Congress are insisting on a cuts-only approach – an approach that doesn’t ask the wealthiest Americans or biggest corporations to contribute anything at all,” Obama said in the East Room of the White House.In a response following the president’s statement, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said Republicans had fought to rein in the national debt, but that Obama had refused to compromise.

A few weeks ago I held a couple of cooking camps over Spring Break. Cooking camps are a great way to feed a kids interest in food and cooking. They get to spend a few hours making treats with other kids and having a great time. I like to sneak in a few healthy treats too! After spending a few hours at cookie camps, kids often want to cook more at home and are at least a bit more interested in what is going on in the kitchen.

But it's all part of our story, all a part of the fabric that is being knit together to form a beautiful tapestry of who we were and who we're becoming.
Every morning I take my coffee thermos out, no matter how chilly the spring air, and sit on our bench and stare at it all in wonder: "I did that," I say aloud. I dug it, Brian tilled it, I raked it all level. I planned it, bought the plants, got them in the ground, weeded and mulched it all. I excavated our buried brick pathway on my hands and knees all archaeologist-style with a garden trowel and a paintbrush. I did it. It's an imminently satisfying feeling - rather a lot like climbing that mountain when we first became a couple.

This is a ridiculous list to write, because every. single. newborn is completely different. In fact, you should go out and do the exact opposite of what I recommend here because chances are your newborn will not agree with my newborn. BABY FIGHT! However, I lived for lists when I was pregnant and took the advice of pretty much all of them, which means that I almost ended up with a lot of useless baby shit. Luckily I was all about keeping the receipts and returned things without prejudice regularly. The Target returns guy and I were total BFFs by the end of all this. So my number one piece of advice in terms of baby gear? Keep the receipts and tags and don't be afraid of returning things if you don't like them, they aren't your style, or they won't work for your family. If you are given something that's not on your registry, try to add it and mark it as fulfilled before returning the item. It's much easier.
You know, my mother met my stepfather at a funeral, so this isn’t exactly unchartered waters in my family. Our women apparently have a penchant for taking advantage of grieving men. It just so happened that my mom was married six months later. I think Mr. Zegna and I will take it slower than that. But then again, you never know. I’ll keep you posted.
I may be alone a lot, but I still don’t think writing has to be as solitary as many people say. In fact, I think the internet offers a wide open community for writers with many different options. Yes, it’s a virtual community, but community none the less. Lets you know you’re not alone in the world. Now before anyone thinks I’ve lost my mind, no I’m not advocating just staying home and never venturing forth into the world, but I’m saying there are many sources of support for writers online.
What I didn’t figure out was that my week old baby could have given three farts about all the blinking, singing, tacky toys I kept shaking in her face. I may as well have taken her to the movie on Fremont Street. Even so, Santa loaded our house with every light-up, blinking, singing toy Wal-Mart ever sold. Our living room did begin to resemble the Vegas strip after awhile.
I remember when I first moved to Paris and was really surprised at the late hours everyone kept. You were ultra conspicuous if you left the office before 7. And then when we pitched the Louis Vuitton relaunch and actually had crazy deadlines for the project (which, by the way, that web site is finally supposed to launch on October 16—finally, some of that work will see the light of day), sure, I worked weekends and long days.

Based on that story, he argues, the DA should have investigated the public representative implicated in it, rather than complain about the journalist. Its failure to do so reveals the party as hypocritical, he says. But does he apply that same logic to the DA's complaint? Of course not.

The end of September we went out the the Silicon Valley to visit our youngest son who is now working at Facebook. We stayed in Los Gatos which is a beautiful town and so pedestrian friendly. We walked each day before breakfast and after dinner. We spent a couple of days doing things with my son and his girlfriend and a couple of days toodling around on our own.

The Mayo case already has been to the Supreme Court once, but was remanded without a decision on the merits. The Federal Circuit originally reversed the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of Mayo, holding that the claims satisfied the then-dispositive “machine or transformation test.” Prometheus Labs., Inv. v. Mayo Collaborative Services, 581 F.3d 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2009). That decision was on appeal to the Supreme Court when the Court decided Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 3218 (2010), broadening the eligibility of method inventions. As a result, the Supreme Court remanded the Mayo case for reconsideration. The Federal Circuit decided once again that the claims were patent-eligible. Prometheus Labs., Inv. v. Mayo Collaborative Services, 628 F.3d 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010). The CAFC reasoned that Prometheus’ steps of “administering” and “determining” were transformative, because the thiopurine drug chemically reacted in the bloodstream to form the detectible metabolites. Thus, the claims did not cover the a naturally-occurring correlation per se, but a specific application of that phenomenon that resulted in drug dosage optimization.
It's time to remember.
Not all Hawkinson works have the effect or the depth of scope of the entrance hall piece. Each of the four commissions has its virtues. Bat, 2007 is craftsmanship par excellance, a night creature made of Radio Shack plastic bags and twist ties. However earnestly it means to convey different types of communication and hearing, the metaphor does not quite work, and the fact that you have to be told that the plastic is from Radio Shack sort of takes a bit of the fun away. It is, however, worth seeing. There is also Octopus, 2007, a photocollage of human body parts creating the sensation of a tentacle packing undersea dweller. Always riffing Ovid, Hawkinson creates a transformation of his own body into a beautiful if not creepy sea monster. We’ve seen this from Hawkinson before in Untitled, 2003, where his body became a sprouting spud, or in Fruit, 2004, a delightful if not slightly cheesy take on the Sistine Ceiling. As with those pieces, it is easy to like Octopus, but with an artist like Hawkinson, you do expect constant wonder and often end up just wondering.

We are all the cupbearer in this story. We have had our ups and downs. Sometimes we have been the king’s officer and sometimes we have been banished. Sometimes we have been in the prison of bad health, bad economics, bad thinking, or bad something else and we have found our way out of that prison back to health, back to wealth, back to power, back to life as we want it. Wherever we are, do we forget what got us there, do we forget what service or grace was given us by those who have helped us, by those who have saved us? Are we ungrateful?

When student loan interest rates were temporarily reduced from 6.8%to 3.4% a few years ago, it was to relieve those who had subsidized Stafford loans during tough economic times. The problem with giving temporary relief to group of individuals who are relatively new to creating personal budgets (recent college graduates) is that they rarely ever prepare for when the temporary relief ends. However, the idea of offering temporary relief in this case was that the economy was bad, so we’d make it easier on those with students loans to handle their debt Then when the economy rebounds and things look better for them, we can return interest rates to pre-relief levels.

A second criticism in Murray’s opinion is that the lack of a clear plan in which to express this wider unity of churches post-1966 “had regrettable consequences”.39 In this context, Murray sees that the question of “schism” was complex and somewhat difficult to relate to for Lloyd-Jones challenged “the adequacy”40 of an inter-denominational evangelical unity expressed through an organisation like the Evangelical Alliance. This, however, served to focus “attention upon the alternative…” envisaged with the ability to exclude or discipline those who were in error. Furthermore, Murray suggests that on the Doctor’s view of schism, those who stayed outside the BEC were thereby guilty of the charge. “Some damage might have been averted”, Murray thinks, “if the alternative unity presented…in 1967hadbeenunderstoodtobemorefluidandopen…”41 andiftheDoctor had been less “hurried than he would otherwise have been”.42

Cultural mores and traditions that inform the themes of films like Kairo or Ju-On are often re-contextualized for a Western audience in their remakes. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, though some critics would argue it results in a simplification of often complex films. Ju-On for instance becomes a haunted house story, losing the non-linear narrative utilized by Shimizu as it adapts to a more Western understanding of haunted spaces. The same is true of Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s Kairo, known stateside as “Pulse,” but whose title resonates more with the word “Circuit” Whereas Kairo is more about the fear of loneliness and an inability to connect, its remake is more about a threatening Other that seeks our destruction though the gateway of technology.
Obviously, I'm in favor of the movie Bully being shown as is, profanity and all, and it's good to see that it will be, MPAA be damned. Language is imperfect, but it's the best thing we have when it comes to communicating. Deciphering what's behind language - the things that go unsaid as well as said - is tricky, and difficult to learn, but if we remain hung up on the words themselves we'll only get so far. And bullying is too critical an issue to let language get in the way of finding solutions.

The age range at the concert appears to be from 16 to 65, and that absolutely tickles me.

However, Thomas has learned a new prayer (he calls it a "blessing prayer") at his Christian preschool that, obviously, has a more religious tone to it. Just recently, he asked if we could start saying his blessing prayer at meal time. Although I've grown quite accustomed to our simple & sweet blessing, how could I say "no" to a change in a blessing prayer? I have to admit, what I find heart warming (and a little funny) is that Thomas leads the prayer. He insists that everyone's hands should be together and our eyes must be closed as we recite after him:

I'd better leave the second foot, don't think it belongs to this lamb. Goodness! Triplets! Another long floppy black lamb arrived, was unceremoniously swung around in the dark (to clear the airways of mucus) and laid next to Michelle who was alternating between washing the new arrival and giving birth. And then the third. The raw brutality of birth, slime and gore and three floppy black lambs sprawled in the hay. Michelle worked hard, licking industriously..and at last a tinny baaaa from each lamb that melted us all. The slime turned to black curly wool....the enormous legs started the struggle to stand. Three new lambs.
Along with these new definitions of bodily maladies came also new definitions for standards of health and wellness, and a new more powerful medical regime whose ability to shape and define the character of disease also allowed it the capacity to shape and regulate the very way society was to come to define bodily characteristics as either normal and abnormal ( Cregan, 2006: 50). Through this capacity medicine became a harbinger of social and moral control via its capacity to interpret abnormality and illness (Cregan, 2006: 46).

Life-skills involve the synthesis of multiple skills practiced simultaneously.

When you face down hordes of the Undead, you will confront a multitude of the walking corpses in differing stages of decomposition. You’re even going to encounter different degrees of wounds and carnage. The social commentary that can be drawn from those simple inferences is dangerous when you really start to think about it…

This was the most powerful volcanic explosion in recorded history, and the ash was carried so far into the atmosphere that it screened the earth from the warmth of the sun. The next year, 1816, was so cold that it was known as the year without a summer. For several years crops failed and food became expensive. The poor became poorer, a situation exacerbated by the potato blight a few decades later. Everyone suffered, but the Welsh soon had special grievances in the form of English taxes imposed by English land lords and English clergy. There were numerous waves of protests, and Karl Marx noted that the Welsh were ripe for rebellion.

The end of last year saw the bullycide of Phoebe Prince in Massachusetts. In that case nine students at her school were arrested and brought up on charges, starting what looked to be a precedent setting case. The most interesting fact is that it was not physical bullying but both cyberbullying and verbal harassment. This year the case went to trial and in the end five teenagers faced harsh probation and records for their actions. While not a landslide case, it does set a precedent for others to follow.

I could see the NGOs on the truck preening themselves in the glow of this recognition and probably increased funding.”

Super doula Sazz (as I call her) came over on Wednesday to cheer me up after two weeks of being cooped up in the house, sick. She bought me a box of chocolates and we chilled out at home for a while, eating chocolate and talking about our favourite books. Then we decided to go for a walk to a bookstore.
Her parents aren’t crazy good looking, but even with his lisp, he seems alright, like he won’t get in your business and the worst you’d have to deal with is occasionally having to race him on horseback and carry him around like Caesar when you lose. Also, you’d have to deal with her weird make up issues, but maybe they fix that. The good news is she kind of looked hot in the horse helmet and I picture a weird fantasy suite thing where she’s got that on and has the whip and Ben repeats “there are moments where I can picture being with him”.

Some people speak of a problem of “grace and free will” – the Church’s answer to this dilemma of how grace and free will co-exist was largely formulated by St. Augustine, the “Doctor of Grace.” However, in the Scholastic period, the discussion entered a new phase – one which is far more profound. The real question is not so much about the relationship between grace and free will, but rather: How God can be the cause of all things (including the freedom of the human will) while man is still a truly free agent?

Today started off with a nice drive through rolling hills from Minneapolis. Actually, there wasn't one hill along the way until I hit Redwood Falls. It was a nice easy drive though. The Brau Brothers had a Group Brew day which I was lucky enough to get involved with. The Brau's put on a Homebrew contest each year where they take the winners recipe and brew up on their own equipment for distribution. This year the distribution of the winning American Black Ale, (CDA, Black IPA, etc) will primarily be distributed in South Dakota, with a few select locations in the Twin Cities receiving kegs, and 750 bottles. Dustin Brau lead the show, and encouraged all 20-30 of us to dough in, stir the mash, clean the lauter tun, and basically...if you wanted to participate in the brew day, you really could. It's a fantastic idea. You can only learn basic concepts from most brewery tours, but this hands on approach really helps you understand the intricate steps within the process demystifying a typical brew day! I can't say enough about the Brau Brothers family. They are just straight up, really good, story tellin, card playin, easy going brewers, just doing a really good job brewing quality beer. They are also growing hops, barley, and rye, and I'm sure some other things. There hops are on their 4th year of growth and they clearly are doing a good job as hop farmers because their Wet Hop Ale this year was frickin fantastic. If you haven't tried their 100 Yard Dash - fresh Hop, you may still be able to find a random 6er on the shelves of your local liquor store if you're lucky. It was extremely bitter, flavorful, and a slight aroma of locally grown hops. I will say that they could've been a little more heavy handed on the hops at the end of the boil on that one. Their Ringneck Braun Ale is my favorite Brown Ale brewed in Minnesota by far.

Those first two Alabama-Florida games in Birmingham would have been Alabama-Tennessee in 1992 and LSU-Florida in 1993 instead. LSU would have reached the championship game in ’93 with a 3-5 SEC record, in part because undefeated Auburn was ineligible for the postseason.
Yet it is so silent. Getting off the bus in downtown Oslo today was as if walking into a church. People are talking, but quietly. They are doing normal things, like walking, shopping, eating, but silently. And not only outside Oslo Cathedral. Oslo is taken back by its tourists and inhabitants, but we are all grieving, we are all still numb. It is a peaceful quietness. A friendly one.
Another thing that I didn't really like in this story was that the plot was a bit loose. From the summary, we get the idea that Brit wants something very essential for his family from Tori, and for that he seduces her. Now, should what he needed was indeed very important, I honestly wouldn't mind the way he treated Tori. But to seduce a woman, just for something like that, is unethical. Surely it's unethical on both accounts, but at least if it's a matter of life and death you can forgive someone the lengths he goes to succeed. But Brit, has no excuses. And I simply couldn't really like him after that. He kind of reminded me a spoiled kid who does anything to achieve whatever he wants.

Amit Bansal - Private sector needs to recognize the certified talent available in the market. If you look at the current situation, there is very limited “direct-benefit” that a student sees in making the investment in training and certification. The student needs an assurance that if s/he is trained and certified, the industry is going to absorb them. Otherwise, for the student the certificate is just another piece of paper! The current recruitment practices in the industry hardly provide any “visible-benefit” to the candidate. Of course, if the student is well trained, s/he will perform well in the interview and get a job. But, normally students do not have the maturity to see that and are looking at “direct-benefit” that is apparent and assured.

4. Since I was a young child, every time I drive by a cemetery, I look to see if it’s a place I want to be buried. When we lived in the NYC metropolitan area, I was always distressed at the way the graves were jammed up so close to each other, and that in some places the coffins were buried vertically, in order to make more room. I used to tell my parents not to bury me there, because I wanted a place with more “elbow room.” What was I thinking? I have since decided that I would prefer to be cremated. I was not morose about my plot-shopping. I just thought I was being practical. Plus I wanted to know where I should do some dancing before I die.)
In the mean time the new-dangled polling machines - Which as we SHOULD all know by now are just like standardized tests forms, was a little modern, a little archaic (do I really need that voter stand to make my selections?) couldn't I just sit on the floor off to the side and work it out?
That first Ardent 45 was a single by a Florida-based doo-wop band called Freddie Cadell & the Twirls, and it didn't take long for Fry's home studio to begin attracting talented young musicians from the local music scene such as Terry Manning and Jim Dickinson, who must have marveled at what they had stumbled onto: Fry's prodigious talent for production and engineering and his quickly growing collection of recording equipment. Fry: "You'd think most people would discourage their kids from getting into anything like this, but my parents just said, 'You can do whatever you want, but whatever it is, try to be good at it.' We were actually recording 45s and putting them out as well as doing rentals and service recording. It was pretty disruptive. Bands were coming to their house all the time, and all my parents ever said was, 'Who are all these people? Why do some of 'em have so much hair?'" The original incarnation of Ardent ended up releasing four singles, including a 45 by local Memphis favorites The Shades, before Fry, having just graduated from high school, decided to move to Pine Bluff, Arkansas to help a friend build a radio station. It was several years later in 1964 that Jim Dickinson, then known as James Luther Dickinson, floated the idea of reviving Ardent, as he was becoming increasingly interested in music production and had some new ideas that Fry, also aching to work in a recording studio again, found intriguing. For the revived label's first release, Fry and Dickinson teamed with another old friend, Terry Manning, by releasing a (Dickinson-penned) single by Lawson & Four More, a local band for whom Manning played organ. However, just a year later, Fry's idyllic home studio faced dismantling, as his parents had decided to sell their East Memphis house. John Fry: "I was at the age then that I needed to make a decision as to whether I wanted to forget about this and go get a grownup job or try to do recording as a profession. I decided to give it a shot, so we went out and rented a store building. It was a brand new building; it had never been occupied, so it was just open space."

Because all the numerous problems of the world come from one source, which is the human ego. Transcending the ego creates a pathway in consciousness that allows others to transcend their egos more easily. Through spiritual growth, your energy field radiates outward to all of humanity and blesses everybody just by your existence. The collective suffering and karma of mankind gets tremendously reduced through one’s own spiritual growth and enlightenment.

Scroll on a couple of years. I was lucky enough to have a stint as a Royal Literary fellow at Exeter University, where it was my role to help students with their essay skills. One of the students who came several times was a Greek postgraduate studying naval battles during a particular period of the Ottoman Empire. As I read his work, I felt that same slightly dizzying shift - or perhaps it could be described as suddenly finding myself on the opposite side of a wall that I hadn't even realised existed: here was a portion of history as full of characters, intrigue, tragedy and triumph, as the Tudors or Dark Age England. It was just that I knew nothing about it.
I began with the peppers and cheese, a most splendid starter. The red peppers (pimentos) had been roasted to perfection in olive oil (they were not out of a jar), and were served with a marinade and cheese. A really nice flavour, and medley of tastes.

I remember back in college when I took a writing class to try to fill in one of my elective credits. The photography class was full and I love writing so it seemed like a good idea. We were doing short stage plays and short stories in that class and honestly it was fun. But there was that one evening where my story was on the chopping block. I know, it happens, but I’m rather reserved. I can’t sit there and watch while people are reading my work…and I certainly can’t sit there and listen to somebody else read it out loud. There’s kind of this moment of “No! That’s now how she would say it; throw some heart into it woman!” What can I say; I attach to my characters.

We celebrated the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe on Monday, Dec. 12. Here is a wonderful article about a Sister of Life in NYC who reflects on Our Lady of Guadalupe. Also in the article, this prayer by Blessed John Paul II, said at the Basilica of Guadalupe in 1979:

7.) I get creeped out by some pretty weird stuff: soup skin, cloves stuck into an orange at christmas, really graphic medical drawings of lungs in science textbooks, bamboo shoots cut too close to the ground, the thought of eating a blackboard eraser, the sound of paper towel coming out of an old dispenser – THESE ALL GIVE ME THE HEEBIE JEEBIES.
As for good girls wanting bad boys? No such thing in either front. Peeps are pretty neutral. When a girl is too timid to do "bad things" she hires it out. She develops the behavior in her man, consciously or otherwise. He gets rewards for doing the things she wants to do but is afraid to do by her reactions to them. Been there, done that. Fun for a while but not a good long term thing. Bad boys often end up dead or seriously hurt from doing more than they can handle being a "bad boy", at which time she will move on to the next "nasty boy"... or... coddle him in his deteriorated health cage.
None of this is helped by the fact that, in preparation, I had to stop all medication which meant that I went slightly nuts for the first week or two until a temporary injection kicked in and restored the balance somewhat.

The 2012 National Cherry Blossom Festival is being celebrated from March 20 – April 27. The average peak bloom date is April 4. Due to warmer than usual weather this year, the peak bloom date is estimated to be March 20-23.

For me, writing a poem is the most sublime of literary experiences in miniature. Every word—where it goes, what it is next to—every comma and full stop and colon or the lack of them, matters to me, whether it is ‘fun’ poetry such as limericks and modern nursery rhymes, or something more serious and deep. But—and this is important—what matters to me as a poet is not necessarily what matters to my readers. When I was doing my MA at Edinburgh, we did something called ‘deconstruction’ as a form of literary criticism. This was supposed somehow to give students an insight into the mind of the poet and his or her meaning. Deconstructing John Donne ruined his poems for me for years (and I think that Jacques Derrida, the inventor of deconstruction, should be consigned to Purgatory, but that is another discussion!). In my opinion (and please feel free to disagree), the essence of a poem will be experienced differently by each and every reader. However the one thing that will be held in common if it is a good poem is that the heart or mind have been touched by some sort of recognition, some sort of ‘oh yes—I have felt/seen/done (or whatever) that’ moment. My own adult poetry writing is triggered by all sorts of things—a walk, emotions high and low, a heard word, the colour of grass, the lines on my mother’s hand to name but a few. I write it for me, because I simply have to get that particular part of me down on paper. I fiddle and wrestle and reformat and layer meanings one on the other until I feel it is perfect of its kind—whether triolet or sonnet or free form. I no longer have to make it rhyme—though I do sometimes. What matters is the baring of my soul, and very often these poems are private and never shown to anyone. They don’t necessarily need any audience except me. My children’s poetry is different. That’s what I have fun with, play with, and hopefully sell. But it’s just as important to me to get it as perfect as I can. This applies to all my writing of course—but because a poem is shorter by its nature, every word is weighed and balanced, every syllable must count or out it goes.

The misuse of prescription drugs is a problem that has been on the rise in America in recent years. Studies show that 6 million Americans begin abusing prescription drugs each year. What is even more startling, however, is that a large percentage of those addicted to prescription drugs are parents and that every time they pop a pill, they are affecting their loved ones, especially their children.

I was not home free yet because I still had to find the ferry terminal when I reached the shore. Upon arriving at the shore, we drove along it for a while until I spotted a sign, “Koh Samet Information” that looked familiar. It was the ferry terminal. I left the songtheuw , paid $2.50 for the ferry ride and was escorted to a small wooden, top-heavy, overloaded ferryboat standing a short way off the wharf. To get on to the ferry I had to climb onto the roof of another ferry that was tied directly to the wharf, climb part way down the other side and then leap about two or so feet onto the very overloaded ferry, no mean feat for an out of shape 70-year-old. But leap I did, and fortunately I was caught by a large australian man and two of his friends. They said, “Ere you go mate,” and “you aright mate,” and a lot of “mate” this and “mate” that. Actually, it sounded more like “might” this and “might” that, or it could have been “mite” which is what I felt like. Anyway, this “mite” was thankful for the “might” of my “mates.” I cannot believe I just wrote that. I shall sleep sounder this evening for it.

Most importantly, if you can’t think of a single original thing to say about the scene, don’t describe it at all. Why waste your time and your readers’ by telling them what they already know?
It's a huge score, full of marvels, embroidered with sizzling colours and layer upon layer of musical cause and effect; the inspired and beautiful choruses and the reflective arias for the Klinghoffers are perhaps its finest moments. The ENO chorus did the former proud and the orchestra ran, so to speak, a tight ship under the expert captaincy of Baldur Bronnimann. Rarely can it have been made so clear that "minimalist" is a misleading misnomer. The music is almost Wagnerian at times, in that the real action takes place in unfolding of the orchestral fabric, the singers floating over the top.

Fixing this is trickier than it sounds. Some games wait for onWindowFocusChanged() instead of onResume(), which works pretty well on Gingerbread. But on Honeycomb and higher, onWindowFocusChanged() is sent when certain foreground windows — like, ironically, the volume control display window — take focus. The result is that when the user changes the volume, all of the sound is muted. Not the developer’s original intent!

In addition to the writing myths that kept springing up, the dialogue was pretty terrible, which would have been unbearable if it hadn't given us more ammunition. A few examples: one of the characters described their mental state as "I guess I went a little nuts!" which I cannot imagine was early-to-mid 19th century jargon. Poe is also referred to as an alcoholic, when it's commonly thought the term wasn't used until 1849...the year he died. Of alcoholism! Or not...by then I'd lost all interest in the fate of Cusack-Poe. No interest in him. No interest in the heroine's fate. No interest in whodunnit. No interest in THE POOR WOMAN he was trying to save FROM THE CLUTCHES OF A MAD KILLER. Nope, I'm out. I'm just gonna steal more popcorn and stoically endure. C'mon, end credits!

James Wood, professor of the practice of literary criticism at Harvard and a regular reviewer in the New Yorker, is the critic I most admire, and I disagree with him on a great many points. We did, however, concur in our high estimation of Hilary Mantel's novels about Thomas Cromwell; even though the opening paragraph of his review seemed to be designed to make me bristle. Wood writes: "Both this new book and its predecessor, Wolf Hall, are mysteriously successful historical novels, a somewhat gimcrack genre not exactly jammed with greatness." My initial response was that the statement was pure phooey.

You know that saying, “take life one day at a time”? Yeah I did that, except to the extreme…right down to the minute. I literally took each task ahead of me, one minute at a time. When I crossed one off the list, I knew I was one task closer to being done. I just kept saying to myself, ‘you can do this. It won’t last forever. Just get through the next hour and you can move on’. This is also similar to my mantra when I run.

It is also instructive that, as has been the practice of the tobacco control lobby for many years, no industry repre­sentatives were allowed to attend or have a voice. Not just the likes of Diageo and Heineken, nobody. Even if you run the most low-carbon, organic, Fairtrade, recycling-friendly micro brewery in the world, as far as the anti-drink lobby are concerned you’re still engaged in a “toxic trade” and they’re not interested in any kind of dialogue or accommodation with you.

I've enjoyed my retail job right now but have been recently hired to teach a few classes in fall - woohoo! I'm super excited/nervous. It's what I've taught before, so I actually have a teensy bit of experience under my belt. It's not exactly a high paying job (at all) but I think it is a "foot in the door job" and will hopefully be a longer term place for me. I'll still be working at my small business and teaching, aka balancing two different trays and I hope I can do it without too many "STRESSED out" melt-downs. My husband is also considering a back to school/graduate degree - not soon, but perhaps in the next few years, which I fully support. So, we've been discussing future plans and such.

Little by little, word spread that you could visit Fuerteventura and enjoy some amazing yoga and Pilates.

Today the general perception among the public is that the murdered Hermanus Potgieter was a scoundrel who had no regard for the law. The Boers who attacked the poor souls hiding in the cave at Makapansgat were all villains. Piet Potgieter, who was shot dead when he tried to peer into the cave entrance, was a reckless fool. Mokopane, was made out to be the real hero in the saga, -- just like ol’ modern-day Nelson Mandela! Despite the controversy over the exact name of this savage the town of Potgietersrus was renamed Mokopane. There is so much space in this country for development that it boggles my mind to think why they have not built a new town yet and called it whatever they wanted! No – it’s much easier to steal the Whiteman’s legacy and rename an exiting town!
Which leads me to another thing. Right now, the only place I write is in my (often dark and cold) bedroom, on my desktop computer. That's it.

It's amazing how quickly you can get out of the habit of doing something that previously seemed second nature. Like, weighing yourself every week. Keeping a check of your bank balance (casts guilty look at Husband working away at the other end of the table). Or writing regular blog posts.
I am looking forward to engaging with these fantastic teachers once again and I can't wait to introduce our wonderful students to each other.
Well, last week, I decided I might be able to get her, now guilt inspiring questions to slow down if I went ahead and painted the wall.
Anyway, I always think that my heart and my humor comes from my mom, but my backbone and my spine comes from my dad. Dad has a persistence that is otherworldly and he is undoubtedly the reason that I can stick to anything like writing for example – even when it’s hard.
The other two books were just average: Starship Troopers by Robert Heinlein and Stephen King‘s latest, Full Dark, No Stars. I gave Troopers 3 stars because there really isn’t much plot to it; rather, it serves as a soapbox for Heinlein to espouse his sometimes questionable ideas about how the military, government and society should function. King’s collection of four horror novellas was just so-so, because I didn’t connect to the characters at all. But both are fast and entertaining reads, though, if that’s what you’re looking for.

But this happened all the time. My favourite was on day 9, some 20 hours into the game, when the same friend started talking about how he couldn’t play on for much longer. He said that if things didn’t resolve themselves soon he’d give up. He was so tired, he said.

A major factor in our muteness was simply shortage of time. The Moms were on the road this past weekend at a family wedding and didn't get settled back to home, hearth, and happy dog until late Sunday evening. The 9/11 anniversary was a focus of some conversation during the festivities, part of the way that long lost cousins reestablished bonds and a sense of what time and adulthood had made of folks once known primarily as fellow occupants of the kids' table at holiday gatherings. Still, most of the talk was happy, as suited the occasion: How's that brother of yours? . . . . I'd like you to meet my second husband. . . . . Holy crap, Mom's on the dance floor! . . . . Do come by for breakfast tomorrow before you take off, OK? We'd love to spend some more time with you. Oh, and there was a certain amount of commentary on Moose's weight loss and the girlie-girl ensemble she wore to the wedding. We'll give you just the smallest peek and trust you to imagine the rest:
After leaving the pub and returning to b+b, I had to share twin room with non other than Councillor Russell Green. At 5am I woke to the sound of what I thought was a low flying jumbo jet but soon realised it was Russell snoring! He even had the cheek to wear ear plugs in case I snored!!
Just before I finish, I’d like to consider two arguments that were put forward by another Elsevier representative, Alicia Wise. The first was that bundling protects some journals that would not otherwise get enough subscriptions to survive. To that I have two responses. One is that at least some of those journals are ones that shouldn’t survive — such as the notorious Chaos, Solitons and Fractals. I think her implication is that Elsevier is protecting the interests of journals in obscure but very worthwhile areas, but is it really those rather than bad journals in perfectly well-represented areas? I would need further evidence.
The word of God speaks volumes on the subject of our speech and what it reveals about us. The book of James gives us an excellent break down of the power of the tongue and the implications of it. Through this study we will learn what our words indicate and learn what God expects of us.
Not only will i be leaving behind a beloved friend (contact will NOT stop) but i’ll probably not see the people i’ve been around even more than my family for the past 5 years for a long time! It’s really quite sad! Then there are the 30 odd people that i have been in education with since i was 4! I’m now 16, so that’s 12 years of knowing them. The good news is that most live in the same place as me, so i daresay we’ll meet occasionally!
So we’re small talkin and he says he’d like to call me. Okay. I always give the okay cuz most guys don’t mean it. He calls. Turns out, he knows my best friend has the concert hook up and wanted to see Katy Perry (really?). I tell him we’re all goin and sure, we could hook him up as well. He’s happy. The night of the concert comes. I tell him to meet us at one of the parking lots at the concert hall, my ass at home doin my nails. He calls me at the parking lot wondering where me and my bff is. I tell him that we didn’t feel like goin but just go to the back door and ask for Usaka Lot. I hang up and laugh cuz there is no hook up. And I know his broke ass had to pay for the parking. I don’t answer the phone after that. I hope (not really) he enjoyed that Katy Perry from the parking lot.

Last Friday, I posted Leading The Charge: Leadership Lessons from the Battlefield to the Boardroom as the Video of the Week. The video featured General Anthony Zinni, retired four-star Marine Corps General and a former Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). If you haven’t seen that post yet, please take some time to view it. If you do not have the time to watch the video, I have provided a comprehensive summary of what General Zinni said in his lecture.

It’s so much easier to be the editor than to be the writer whose words are torn apart. As a writer, you become attached to your words. The way you arranged them on the page (or screen) was an incredible organic process. It’s the way they’re meant to be. So why doesn’t your editor understand that? While some editors use editing notation with the same fervor as a viking swung a broadsword back in the day, most make corrections to improve your piece rather than to split hairs and send you to the sanitarium. They mean well. Remember that.
It’s a well-known fact that exercise improves the circulation of immune cells in your blood. The job of these cells is to neutralize pathogens throughout your body. The better these cells circulate, the more efficient your immune system is at locating and defending against viruses and diseases trying to attack your body.
In spite of a multidecade international campaign to enforce the message that increasing amounts of the "pollutant" carbon dioxide will destroy civilization, large numbers of scientists, many very prominent, share the opinions of Dr. Giaever. And the number of scientific "heretics" is growing with each passing year. The reason is a collection of stubborn scientific facts.

Off in the far corner of Europe is Greece. Greece is covered in crumbling old things from History, with some nice islands and people. Greece is where you go on Holiday. The Greeks are currently not embracing the EU rules for fiscal discipline. The Germans want the Greeks to give up half their personal income to keep Bankers in a new Mercedes every year. The Greeks just want to go fishing or have a nap. This will be messy but ultimately the Greeks will get their country and their Drachma back. We can go back to lazy days in a Greek seaside bar drinking Ouzo and Retsina (and wondering why) while watching nice sunsets.

It rained a couple of times, which brought him to the burial site to make certain that nothing of his wife's could be seen.

The good news: In my opinion the price achieved by Treasury under the auspices of NAMA in the current marketplace is outstanding. And NAMA also did very well to generate a profit on the transaction despite firstly, commercial property values dropping 10%+ since November 2009 and secondly, NAMA paying a long term economic value premium. With a paucity of large transactions of similar buildings recently it is difficult to ascribe values but I note that the Department of Transport bought a more traditionally prestigious, though internally dated, building for €283 psf this month 500 metres away on Clare Street. Furthermore it is my opinion that the outlook for commercial prices is challenging for the next two years with a general oversupply, a difficult economy and the prospect of retrospective downward rent reviews. The sale to Google, one of the world’s great companies is most welcome to the economy now, both for the vote of confidence in the country’s future and for giving us one of the few major commercial transactions we are likely to see in 2010/2011. And our reputation as a technological hub for non-EU companies will be enhanced so in the years to come, we may well attract the EU operations of baidu , yandex or guriji.

Maybe our biggest fear of all is being abandoned and rejected. And if you add that fear with the threat of losing your entire existence, everything that you are used to, I venture to say that most people become very scared.
But without taking away from that, this comfort lulls you into a false sense of security. You extend your trust to cover everyone in the pub. You start behaving as if you are at home. I wasn't the only person to leave my bag unattended that night (I wasn't the only person whose bag was tossed). Every time I'm in this or other pubs, I see bags on backs of chairs with purses and valuables in them. I see phones left on tables when people go to the bar or toilet. I see jackets hanging with wallets in them.

Some people may advocate for one method over another, and say those who use only the other method, (whether education, direct action, baking, or anything in-between), the definition of Vegan does not tell us How, it just tells us Do.

So the trio of Darran Charles (vocals, guitar and keyboards), Steve Roberts (drums and vocals) and Brian Beller on bass, are doing something absolutely right. Vocally Godsticks remind me of Event, the American progressive metal band what a somewhat similar approach to music. After all, I think these guys don’t care about boundaries or styles, but just create music that feels good to them. And are damn good at it too. I can imagine reading these words does not shed any light as to what to expect from this disk. That is why I will end with just the simple advice to go out and buy this thing immediately. This is too good to ignore and belongs in every serious music lovers collection.

I think this is going to be a really good fight coming up in July. I think this could either be a fight that works as a stepping stone for Khan to get a much bigger fight such as Mayweather.

I think back to that very first day. D was three. She was and is such a smart little girl. I've everyday been amazed. She had only ever been at home with me, but I had been realizing that she would just blossom in a structured learning enviroment. I knew it would be good for her, too. It's not that she lacked interactions with other kids, but I knew that it would boost her social skills.

Importance of college education can be understood from the way it equips a person to meet competition head on. The past two decades has seen a stream of professionals from countries such as India, China, South America, Korea, etc. make a beeline for America in search of job opportunities. An average American has to compete with these highly educated, experienced, ambitious and hardworking people to get a job. In such a scenario, a college education will better equip him to compete with these professionals.

Firstly the Prime Minister must be castigated for having the cheek to claim that the RM1.5 billion is an insignificant amount relative to the EPF fund size. Regardless of whether it is RM1.5 million or RM1.5 billion or even RM15 billion, the EPF funds must be managed stringently and not be subjected to abuse. Similarly whether the amount is a RM100 or a RM1 million bribe, if its a crime, being the lesser amount provides absolutely no justification.

I know I’ve used the term before, but I’m beginning to regret it. The term found footage really gives the audience a set of expectations that really aren't fair to some movies put under this banner. Case in point is Skew, which was made before the explosion of the ‘found footage’ movies in 2005 but has found release last year. It is a shame as I can already see audience members being frustrated even though the movie is very clever in execution.

To me springtime is one of the best times to visit a farm; because it is when new life begins again with the fuzzy chicks, ducklings and goslings; and pet the piglets, ponies and goat kids. It is good for kids to be kids—run around the fields, interact with the animals, ride on a bale of hay or a pony.

You see, while Ilsa loves to torture people for the sake of national security, she also loves cock. You could say it's her one true weakness, that, and an inability to say no to creepy Obergruppenführers when they inevitably ask her to expel urine on them. Her insatiable need to have an erect penis immersed inside the pure, reasonably unsullied confines of Aryan vag on a semi-regular basis is actually what leads to her downfall. She acquirers her daily allocation of cock from the ranks of the camp workers, and if their cock doesn't meet with her high standards (i.e. hump heartily until she achieves orgasm), she will instruct her black clad minions to haul you down to the lab, where she will personally take away your junk.

I couldn’t help but be humbled by the attitudes of the farmers I met that day. Without receiving any outside help to tackle the problem of soil fertility near to their homes, they did what they had to do to provide for their families. Even though this entailed daily treks to the farms before hours of manual labour and backbreaking walks back with heavy loads, this was accepted with minimal complaints. These farmers would easily benefit from good agricultural practices that MoFA tries to promote, but they weren’t being provided with the extension due to poor planning and even poorer infrastructure. Although I was frustrated with the situation, the farmers of Monchani were accepting. Of course they would like help if it was provided, but they were determined to persevere despite it.

Whilst we are sitting in the breakfast circle on of our group, Claire is fiddling with a stick in the grass. One of the oldest boys notices and we have a conversation about sticks; 'stock' in German, a language game develops, pointing to our three sticks; "stock stock stick. Stock, stick stick. Stock, stick, stock." This develops into digging at the long grass with sticks, which then develops into a farming game, raking the dead grass like hay. The boy co-opts two of my colleagues into the game telling them when they can have a break and stop for coffee. Another boy in his peer age group comes over and is invited to join the 'work' a much smaller girl wants to join in too and us given a stick to work with. He spends the whole morning at this work and creates big pile of grass which he surrounds with sticks.

PreS-Gr 3--When Cora's Filipino family cooks together, she's always stuck doing the "kid jobs." Then one day when her older siblings are out and about, Cora gets her chance to bond with Mama in the kitchen. She even gets to choose her favorite dish, so the two of them make a large bowl of noodles, chicken, and vegetables called pancit. Clear expository prose explains how to perform kitchen tasks. For example, Mama tells Cora, "Open the package of rice noodles and put them in this bowl of water." Then she engages her daughter by asking her, "Do you know why we soak them?" These scenes effectively model how adults can introduce children to cooking. The simple, direct style also makes the book equally well suited as a read-aloud and for newly independent readers. The artwork nicely complements the text, as Valiant's warm hues of gold, red, and orange highlight the family's loving relationship. They also capture Cora's feelings through facial expressions. Wide eyes and smiles show the child's joy at cooking with her mother, while a downcast mouth and arched eyebrows illustrate her anxiety that her family won't like her pancit. Although this dish is unique to Cora's culture, children of all backgrounds will share her feelings at being allowed to help cook a meal for the first time. A solid choice for schools and public libraries, especially where family-based programming is popular.--Mary Landrum, Lexington Public Library, KY

Is there a more familiar meal to the average American family than one that includes some form of meat and potatoes? One of those hearty meals is definitely Meatloaf and it's usually accompanied by some form of potato side dish. Now, I know that meatloaf isn't necessarily just an "American" concept. It's origins date back to fancy meat terrines and pates that have been made in multiple cultures for centuries, but the one I'm posting today is the simple version that has graced the tables of American families for generations.

These days the term “climate change” is used as a substitute for “global warming”, but fewer of us are fooled by this. Al Gore is planning a last-ditch effort in September to revive the hoax, but that will fail.
People usually hate their stomachs because they have difficulty controlling their eating habits, they hate its appearance, or it gives them stomach aches; I hate mine for growling, nay, roaring. It can make any canine cower and whimper. It can make a thunderstorm appear mild in comparison. It can make a G6 sound like a G4 (Which means it is quiet. Almost like a TV channel nobody watches). I may not be as fly as a G6, but my stomach can be as loud as one.

And its still me. I'm the same person I always was.... and if people judge me? Fine. Let them. But I will always be me and no matter what the circumstances are, who I am inside is what really matters. And my flaws I have on the outside do not make me weak. They keep me fighting. And I choose to feel happy INside... in spite of these circumstances.
Whilst they fell out of favour in residences, refectory tables endured as library tables, common now in larger residences. The most high priced are inlaid with uncommon woods like burr walnut and rosewood, but easier Victorian styles can be discovered for acceptable price tag in antique retailers. As with refectory tables, they will need to be formed from two or three planks of tricky-putting on wood and exhibit a loaded patina with a good deal of signs of use.

I continue to be amazed that auto insurance companies–especially the “we’ll keep you legal for less” sort–will do absolutely anything in their power not to pay your claim.
We would sing and recite prayers in English and Zulu. But between the singing and praying, boys being boys would be pinching girls’ behinds. I don’t think God smiled approvingly at those scenes. In fact, I suspect that, angry with these pictures of disrespect, He turned His back on us.

The hardest part it not being able to browse the library. As soon as we walk in, I'm allowed a very limited amount of time to find something for myself. Five minutes tops. My kids make these faces the whole time as I look around for something interesting to read that say 'I'm so over this'. And on top of that, my youngest usually cries and whines until I take them all to the kids section. So yeah, library time is hard for a book lover with kids. Then I discovered something, online book reservations. This happened only recently (like a month ago) and I have no idea why I'm so late to the party. I can get onto my libraries website, browse various titles, and hold what I want. It's so easy. Instead of having to plan out every minute browsing, I can just go in and pick up what I want when it's available without all the hassle. And I can take my kids straight to their area and spend time with them there without feeling frustrated because I don't get time to pick out some titles for myself.

What was the purpose of this Foundation? It was set up to promote the political beliefs of the Jamaat al-Islami. What were its political beliefs? Primarily it was, and still is, to spread sharia law not only to all Muslims, but also to all non-Muslims, throughout the globe – hence the Global Jihad.
"Does your mother really think it is ideology that separates us? I couldn't care less about her political beliefs! She's the one who doesn't like what I think! But you and I don't agree and I'M MARRIED TO YOU. Obviously, political ideology is not as important to me as it is to her."

From Josh Harris’s blog in 2008: Today I got a letter in the mail that Louie and Shelley Giglio sent out to friends of Passion. It was a report of all that God has been doing through the Passion World Tour. It sounds like it’s been incredible. But then the letter ended with an announcement that completely shocked me: Louie is planting a church in Atlanta. Here’s what he wrote:

Sometimes life throws shit at you to test you. Running has made me realize that I'm a lot tougher than I thought I ever was. Seriously, your mind starts going crazy at the fortieth kilometre and your quads are screaming at you to stop, and it takes everything in your power to just keep going. Sometimes a little adversity is just the impetus that pushes you to achieve what you never thought you could, and what goes in your head transcends all.
The world’s robust new superpower, embodied in Beijing destroyed, is managing its own fate.

Going over the pros and cons of it, there are a few pros to it actually, even though overall it’s a step backward for the necessary Internet site.
My first piece of advice to someone who is serious about being a professional television or film actor is:move to Los Angeles.Moving to Los Angeles can be difficult but it is the only city that doesn’t put a ceiling on where you can go with your career.New York is the place to go if you want to do theater.But if you want to be in film and television, move to LA.
First, lets really define the word synergy: The interaction of two or more agents or forces so that their combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects. The moment my heart was fully aligned with my soul desire, I found this place I now live in on craigslist. My landlady being fully aligned to my energy, trusted me to come up with the money needed to move in and just handed me the key.
Last night she went out with her cousin Chelsea. As she was walking out the door, she said she'd either be home "later" or stay the night at the friend's they were headed to. I opened my mouth to request a rather more specific plan, and to go through my usual magical-thinking routine of questions designed to reassure me that she would be safe.

Please refer to last week’s post titled In the Thick of Things for point of reference. We experienced a similar day yesterday with one huge difference: everyone remained relatively upbeat and calm. Let’s explore some of the reasons why.
Writing is about rewriting. That’s the learning process. That’s the time to take the script/manuscript apart, see what’s working and what’s not and then put it back together. And then do it all over again and again. Be willing to cut out sections that don’t work, whether it’s an entire act or one sentence. Writers fear that if they make changes they won’t know any other way to make it better. It’s the fear of the unknown which we all experience. But I say you can make it better. I know this for a fact. Even though at the time you don’t see how it could be different you can do it. If you generated the first idea you can certainly create a superior idea. Give it time but it’s there in your head, you just haven’t tapped into it yet. That’s what your love affair with writing is all about: Being willing to give up what you have written but have faith you will find a better way to express it.
It's interesting to note that this is wheeled out as part of the manifesto rather than having acted on this decline over the last 13 years. The British Beer and Pub Association recently released figures to suggest that we are losing 28 pubs a week and has topped 58 per week at a peak. Naturally special interest groups shout from the pumps and beer cellars that we need to do something about this decline and link closures to this kind of political promise. But do we need to save pubs? Strange maybe for a pub blogger but I say broadly in towns and cities no we don't need to save them. A recession and harsher trading conditions are a great leveller for any service business. My rationale is that roughly speaking a bad business will fail and a well run one which is relevant to its customers - with good service, well kept beer and a sense of community will survive. These well run businesses may even prosper from the failure of less successful pubs. Yes, there are wider issues of the way the industry works but I think there is a certain truth in good businesses prosper, bad ones don't. We didn't save whole industries; the closure of which decimated whole towns, villages and regions so why start with saving pubs. Save the industries and you in turn save the pubs that serve the communities in which those industries are based. In smaller towns and villages where there may only be a handful of pubs, a declining population, property bought for weekend getaways, the argument is admittedly different and this is where Brown's measures could make a difference. The manifesto continues to claim that:

Lo! your Lord is Allah (Inna rabbakumu Allahu) Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days, then mounted He the Throne. He covereth the night with the day, which is in haste to follow it, and hath made the sun and the moon and the stars subservient by His command. His verily is all creation and commandment. Blessed be Allah, the Lord of the Worlds! S. 7:54 Pickthall; cf. 10:3

I keep having dreams about living in the same apartment building. The apartment building looks the same in every dream. It’s on the second floor, but at the end of the building where there’s like a pavement driveway thing that slopes upward to my apartment door. So the apartment windows aren’t on the ground, but my apartment door technically is because the pavement slopes up to my door. It’s on a corner; The building faces a fairly busy street, with a small side street intercepting it.

Unfortunately, the process of finding information – and particularly correct information – about Victorian offenders is not always as smooth as it might be. For a start most offenders in the past, as in fact now, often made a concerted effort to ensure that they left no incriminating evidence of, or record about their offending. When offenders were given no choice in the matter of having some evidence created (such as a court transcript, or a criminal record, or prison form), they could also seek to obscure real and relevant information being held for posterity. Quite simply, just because someone in authority asked a question of them, it did not guarantee a sensible of accurate answer.
Reports of male rape first appeared some three years ago, but the story only achieved widespread prominence after the police arrested sisters Sophie and Netsai Nhokwara and Rosemary Chakwizira, three prostitutes, last October, when they were found in possession of a bag of – ugh – used condoms. They were subsequently charged with the violation of seventeen men.

But the show itself? Rocked. Ignore the lame video screen and focus on the act itself, and you'll be pleased. The band looks essentially the same as they did in the 1970s and 80s-- two dudes with suits, hats, sunglasses, and the trademark long (if a bit grayer) beards, and the un-bearded drummer, Frank Beard. Three "Beards," one way or another.

The NASB and the NIV have undergone only one or two revisions in their much longer lifetimes. Why so many changes? Isn’t Crossway embarrassed by the fact that their colossal ESV Study Bible is now outdated with its inferior readings?
Without a strong government presence, journalists are increasingly forced to answer to the drug cartels rather than the laws of the country, hampering the freedom of the press. In Reynosa, a border town in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, the Committee to Protect Journalists reports that “[t]he Gulf cartel controls much of the local government… from law enforcement down to street vendor permitting…. That story has not been reported in the local news media, however, because the cartel also controls the press.”
One of the most challenging finishing hole in the desert, hole # 18 at the SilverRock Resort in La Quinta, CA. Just watch the video below and check out the decisions that you have to make playing here. Off the tee, you don’t want to hook your shot because there are lot of expensive cars sitting in the parking lot (including mine). More concern is the lake situated on the right hand side. It is very reachable playing from the white tees. The last time I played there, my ball came to rest just inches from the water’s edge. It’s better to be in the middle but my playing partner (with a single digit handicap) drew his ball so badly that he ended up left of the fairway.
I’m not naive, I know the system will fight back and hard. But I don’t like the world how it is, and this is not something I can simply ignore, because I’m reminded of it every single day, many times. So unless I try to change it, I don’t have the right to complain about it.

The fact that Beer Blending was set aside as a session for some pretty serious – and very-not-so-serious – people is both a credit and a delight. My only hope now is that by the time I write something in a few years time it will be about the fact that there is something like The Local Taphouse in every state. I’m starting to feel a little guilty that we and Sydneysiders have this all to ourselves. And you can blend that any way you like.

I'm dysphoric manic right now (I think that's the spelling). Meaning, I'm not euphoric, happy, hyper, running around with enthusiasm. I'm frozen. I'm irritable. I don't know what to do with myself. Normally when I'm manic (I've never been this kind before) I get a million things done. I write pages and pages and pages of stories and I'll work on 3-4 projects at once, writing a couple chapters on each in one sleepless night. I talk fast, I have to go out and I have to do things.

More specifically: it’s desperately short of assets and poorly organized. It’s therefore unable to keep up with scientific advances and poorly equipped to protect public health. – The preceding comments are straight out of the article. Over the past two decades, the agency’s responsibilities have soared but its appropriations have stayed the same. Think about it. You’re a hospital administrator in a small rural town – you’re hospital has 15 beds. Your hospital is not-for-profit, and therefore your entire budget is based upon a fixed tax base that isn’t changing or increasing in value. Over a 20 year period, you must admit and treat increasing numbers of patients, to the point where you must serve 3X as many patients today than you did in 1987. But the local government has allocated new tax dollars to other projects – a new water tower, a new fire district, a public park or two – and kept your tax levy the same. Therefore you have 1/3 of the resources per patient than you did 20 years ago. So you can’ t hire additional doctors, or buy new computers, or add new beds. Factor inflation into the mix and its probably more like 1/5 the resources. All because someone at the county political district decided money was needed for other projects…projects that got that board member elected. Sounds ridiculous doesn’t it? This is what’s happened to the FDA. This is what happens to all government-run agencies at some point. This is what happens when elected members of government, with layers of competing interests and political agendas, are in charge of something that didn’t get a lot of press before they campaigned. It doesn’t work, and it’s embarrassing that the FDA’s computers can’t recognize road salt from table salt.
