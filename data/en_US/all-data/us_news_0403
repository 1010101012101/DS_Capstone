That's because LaMarcus Aldridge (35 points, 10 rebounds) played one of his best games as a pro, scoring 20 points in the fourth, including a string of 10 straight. He did most of his damage inside, too, mixing pump fakes with duck unders and hook shots with nifty left-handed finishes.

During a taping, Escobedo, 18, was trying to persuade Sheindlin that he was not responsible for an accident in Houston that caused considerable damage to a car driven by 19-year-old Angelique Trump, who had filed a small claims suit against him. But the student's case was crumbling. Escobedo, who had no driver's license, testified that he had taken his father's car without permission and had switched places with his passenger after the collision, telling police he was not driving at the time of the crash. Still, he claimed, the accident was Trump's fault.

In addition to Dutch elm disease fungus, which is transmitted by a bark beetle, there's also Cephalosporium wilt, a different fungus spread to pre-existing wounds by wind, rain, insects and birds. Verticillium wilt is another potentially fatal fungus that is soil-borne and enters through the roots. Elm phloem necrosis is a mycoplasma (virus-like organism) that is even more deadly than Dutch elm disease and is typically passed from elm to elm via the elm leafhopper. In addition, there's a bacterial wetwood that mimics wilt diseases and also causes branch dieback, plus at least eight species of fungi that cause trunk and branch cankers and dieback. Need I mention a variety of wood borers that attack stressed elms, further weakening them?

Launch this year: Develop a public-private partnership that will make college affordable to every qualified high school graduate -- and make community colleges a key link in that partnership. Expand this community's nationally respected early childhood education programs.

Juarez said he believed the inmate was handcuffed because he never raised his hands to protect his face from the deputies' fists, instead shouting: "I am doing nothing wrong; please stop."

Goodell would hear the expected appeals. He did not reduce the suspensions of Saints head coach Sean Payton (2012 season), GM Mickey Loomis (8 games) and interim/assistant coach Joe Vitt (6 games) for their roles and cover-up of the program upon appeal last month.

Perhaps it's a matter of age. McLaughlin, who died 35 years ago at 77, was more than a generation older than the artists who created the first big wave of L.A. excitement in the 1960s. Those were gifted, exhilarating twenty- and thirtysomethings, who put the youthful city on the national art-map. McLaughlin was — and is — something else: He's the city's real Modern Old Master.

For the next 5 miles, the red dirt road narrowed, with some of the turns necessitating a "you first; no, you first," when meeting another vehicle.

B.o.B’s detractors decry his habits of cozying up to pop stars and welding huge stadium-rock choruses to deftly delivered hip-hop stanzas. Hardcore purists who had a hard time dealing with “Airplanes,” his duet with Hayley Williams of Paramore, should brace themselves for “Both of Us,” a Taylor Swift collaboration that will be taking over the radio at any moment now. But nobody ever says B.o.B can’t turn up the heat during a verse. When he makes giddy pop-rap — which, as his mixtapes prove, isn’t always — it’s because he really digs pop, understands and respects classic pop song architecture, and maintains an ear for melodies that exceed the usual confines of hip-hop choruses. In fact, he seems to get classic pop better than some of his producers do. The chart-topping Dr. Luke contributes three typically grabby productions to “Strange Clouds,” and while it would surprise no one if they were all huge hits, these streamlined compositions lack the richness typical of B.o.B’s songwriting. Better are the collaborations with OneRepublic’s Ryan Tedder (“So Good,” “Never Let You Go”), which preserve both B.o.B’s goofy-romantic personality and his handy way with a chord change.

Bobby Womack has been making records since the early '60s. But where Auerbach deferred to history, playing up the retro vibe for Dr. John on "Revolution," Damon Albarn and his co-producer, Richard Russell, find a home for Womack in the here and now with "Please Forgive My Heart." Womack memorably guested on Gorillaz' latest albums, "Plastic Beach" and "The Fall." But he sounds more at home here, his soulful wailing underscored by sparse piano, keyboard orchestration, a pulsating bass groove and skittering electronic beats. The end result should speak to fans of classic soul and James Blake in the same amazing breath (not counting purists).

In a wholly different vein was KT Nelson's "Red Tea," a poignant duet danced on Saturday night by Derek Sakakura and Rosselyn Ramirez. Grounded by an evocative score by Max Richter, the dancers searched and wandered through scenic designer Kim Turos' garden of greenery and silver cubes as if they were dipping into a pool of memories and longings. Sakakura traced undecipherable squiggles on the ground, then across the body of Ramirez, who shivered as though uncomfortable in her own skin. Quietly reflective and wistful at one moment and then suddenly ferocious at another, it was the kind of performance that called up emotions and memories that were hard to put a finger on or define, but which moved all the same.

The script: Wheaton led OSU with 73 catches for 986 yards (13.5 per catch) but only got into the end zone once for a touchdown-challenged offense. Given his ability to stretch the field, he should be in the end zone more often. Cooks, who oozes potential as a big-play receiver and kick returner, caught 31 passes for 391 yards (12.6 per catch) and had three touchdowns. In combination with quarterback Sean Mannion, assuming OSU gets production from the tight end position and can run the ball, this is potentially a dynamic offense with this group of wideouts. Wheaton and Cooks both hit the weight room hard in the off-season and gained some pounds. "I knew I had to get stronger,"said Cooks. They have also been building chemistry with Mannion. "I had a pretty good season last year," said Wheaton. "I just want to build on that.''

"She wept almost every day in the month before the marriage." Imagine this woman. At 30, no longer young, she's begging her father not to marry her off to the respectable widower. The place is Sardinia, 1943 — so many houses already bombed, the dark pine trees by the ocean, the rocky coast. And so she marries and moves into his house, "where there is light from the south and from the sea, which invades fiercely until sunset, and makes everything sparkle." Milena Agus' novel of a granddaughter telling her grandmother's story occurs in that sparkle of light, in the eyes of someone left behind, and is a cautionary tale. Unable to have children with her husband, the grandmother went to a spa, where she met a wounded soldier and fell in love. The novel takes on the feel of Marguerite Duras' powerful little book, "The Lover" — pure passion in an enclosed (emotional and physical) space. She becomes pregnant, returns to her widower, has a son and longs for the veteran. This longing takes shape: It lingers in the house after her death; it lives on in the notebooks, poems and letters saved. It is inherited by her granddaughter, who tells this story. It does not dilute with time and death. It gets stronger. After all, fiction plays by different rules.

Return the noodles to the colander and rinse under cold water until the water runs clear or the noodles are not as slippery. This will remove excess starch. Drain well.

The key question is how to pay for it. Maryland is running close to its self-imposed debt limit. The state has committed itself to issuing debt that amounts to no more than 4 percent of Marylanders' personal income or 8 percent of state revenues. Under current spending plans, the state has significant capacity under the personal income standard, even if the economic recovery stagnates, but not under the revenue standard. A recent report by the state Capital Debt Affordability Committee found that if the nation falls into a double-dip recession, Maryland will probably exceed the 8 percent cap even if it adds nothing to its current spending plans.

Washington closed to within a point in the early going but followed by making just one field goal during a 4 1/2-minute span, allowing Cleveland to pull away again.

What we had, and what so many of today's children lack, was a stable family and the idea that a good education was extremely important.

After all, the most accurate predictor of how well a child does in school is the educational level of his or her parents.

The middle class is struggling. The top 1 percent of the income gradient has gotten very rich indeed. And many people want to occupy Wall Street."

In an effort to gauge caffeine’s long-term, rather than its immediate effect, researchers waited two years after a woman’s last dietary report to begin inquiries about her mental health. At that time also, they asked about health and lifestyle behavior, such as alcohol consumption, tobacco use, exercise, marital status and involvement in social or community groups. Then, at least twice over the next four-year period, they would ask her whether she had been diagnosed with depression or had begun taking antidepressant medication on a regular basis in either of the previous two years.
What our country is experiencing is not unlike what we experienced in Joplin. We became vulnerable at 5:41 p.m. on May 22, 2011. The natural disaster we experienced has brought out the best in humankind. Our strength in character as a community came from our ability to support one another and to graciously accept the support and advice from people we had never met. We were faced with adversity unlike anything we had ever seen. It was our time to step up, and we did.

The House of Delegates' vote Friday night in favor of the Civil Marriage Protection Act was a tremendous step forward for equality and justice and for the rights of Maryland families. For many of the 72 delegates who supported same-sex marriage, the vote was a courageous one, coming in the face of promised retribution at the ballot box and, in at least one case, threats of physical violence. It followed two hours of passionate but civil debate and was the culmination of months of preparation by advocates on both sides of the issue. For those who believe in the transcendent right of equal protection under the law, it was a moment of well deserved celebration.

Grohl: I feel the same way about it as how I felt at this massive car show in Pomona last weekend that I entered my 1965 Ford Falcon van into. I've never entered a car show before, and I don't really know a lot about it, but we put the van into the competition. My friend Troy, who built the thing, said to me, "I think we're gonna win." I asked him, "Why's that?" He said, "Because there are no other vans here." I ended up winning first in class. It's kind of the same feeling.

Kaptur, who's also 65, can fill that role. Though ideologically similar to Kucinich -- they both, unfortunately, embrace protectionism on trade and wishful thinking on entitlement reform -- Kaptur is a Capitol Hill insider: the No. 2 Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, a powerful position that has consistently benefited her current constituents. Earmarks may be shunned in today's Washington, but the clout of an appropriator is not going out of style. Kaptur also has a proven knack for assembling coalitions at home, bringing together business, labor, university and government officials behind common goals, such as Toledo's promising solar energy industry. That ability differentiates her from Kucinich.

But then, that’s been the Libertarians’ pitch for a long time, and the party isn’t exactly setting the political world on fire. According to a rough tally in January by Ballot Access News, less than one-half of 1% of voters in the United States registered as Libertarians. Although the party’s ranks are gradually growing in California, it still counts only 93,300 registered members, or 0.55% of the state’s voters.
A sharp-eyed shopper quietly calls my attention to former ABBA member Benny Andersson, who went on to produce "Mama Mia!" the hit musical and movie with sugary renditions of ABBA's musical confections. Benny totes an ecologically sound string bag and shops for deli food, while fellow shoppers pretend not to notice him. There are, of course, also ABBA tours in Stockholm, the 1970s supergroup's hometown (see "If you go"), though no guarantees of star sightings.
“I don’t want to think about it,” said reliever David Robertson. “Because I don’t have to think about it. As far as any of us know, he’ll be back next year and the year after that. How will the fans react? I’m guessing they’ll react the way they always react. Loudly.”

Warmer memories
2007, Czech Republic, in Czech with English subtitles, 90 minutes. No, this isn't the Czech version of "Girls Gone Wild," but it does at first suggest an innocent teen flick in which three teenagers and the young brother of one of them decide to run away and find adventure. Some of what they find is threatening, but for one of the young girls, the trek marks a sexual awakening that is handled with stark honesty. Very nice performances by director Karin Babinská's young cast.
The deal, which once accounted for about 40% of Israel's natural gas, was plagued by violence and lack of security in the Sinai. Militants attacked or blew up gas pipelines at least 14 times over the last year, disrupting the flow to Israel and raising fears that Islamic extremism was taking hold. The Egyptian army twice dispatched soldiers to the region; Israel last week warned its citizens vacationing on the peninsula to leave because of possible terrorist threats.

Jim Yeager of Taylor, Ariz., escaped with Henninger and a handful of others after hiding under shocks of millet for a night. He said he'll never forget how the dying men called out for their mothers in the shooting spree.

Azi is the first K-9 dog Sherwood has had since 2006. A decade ago, Sherwood had two police dogs, but both were medically retired. The department didn't have money to replace them, but last spring, a resident donated money to restart the K-9 program. Capt. Mark Daniel, who is a former K-9 handler himself, viewed videos of four dogs and picked Azi immediately because he noted how Azi kept his nose to the ground.

BIG MAN OF THE FAMILY
Given the title, you already know this is going to feature a lot of sex, and it does, as it tells the story of a naive but hunky young man named Adam, looking for a break in Hollywood, not to mention true love, but getting snagged by the porn industry and hustling along the way. He's managing to balance things well enough until he falls in love with one of his clients, who is a famous TV star resolutely in the closet. In all, frothy fare but quite fun.

øIf you live in a high-tax state, then munis from your state can be exceptional. A nine-year California muni bond offered Thursday was yielding 2.68%. Let's say you were in California's maximum 10.3% tax bracket and the U.S. 35% tax bracket. To earn 2.68% after taxes, you'd need to find a bond yielding 4.9%.
Rains is planning more than a crepe stop this time around.

The American League Gold Glove award for center fielder went to Boston Red Sox outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury, who by many measures had an MVP-caliber season for the Sox. He did not, by a measure that I like, have the best season in center.

Both of the Milwaukee Brewers' center fielders, Nyjer Morgan and Carlos Gomez, had better plus/minus scores than Ellsbury, and in the American League two center fielders had significantly better years in center. Detroit's Austin Jackson was a plus-30 in center -- and what a center field he called home -- and LA Angels' Peter Bourjos was a plus-24 and spent most of the season widely regarded as the best at his position in the game.

Brown said he took community college courses and hoped to work as a police officer, but he said they didn’t want him and he found himself ill-equipped to fight a losing court battle. That’s when he set law school as a goal and tried unsuccessfully for township council and state Assembly.
"The presence of these thresholds and the corresponding rebate requirement have provided an incentive for insurers to seek lower premium increases than they would have otherwise," the report said. "This 'sentinel' effect on premiums has likely produced more savings for consumers and employers than the rebates themselves."

I compare that to the movie business. In the real world, Steven Spielberg can direct only one movie a year. But he's a man with a very active imagination and wants to do more, so he produces and writes and is involved in a lot of projects. It's the same for me. I'm not a factory, it's just that I have a lot of stories I want to get out there. I have a 5-inch-thick folder of (story outlines) I haven't gotten to yet.

Fourth Preseason Game
Gordon Edes, ESPN.com: "How much trust has Valentine lost in the Red Sox clubhouse, just 10 games into his first season as Boston's manager? And what can he do to get it back? The Red Sox's ability to compete this season might well depend on the answer to that question. Valentine was supposed to restore order to a clubhouse still reeling from this past September's collapse, and for all the brave talk about turning the page this spring, there still were wounds that had not fully healed."

Worse, the president's critique, and in particular the reference to "unelected" judges, buys into an unfortunate and largely unwarranted conservative critique of judicial power. We want our judges unelected. We want them to have the final constitutional say. The president should be arguing for a second term to prevent the court from tipping in an even more conservative direction, not channeling tired critiques from the right about activist judges legislating from the bench.

• Five things to take from Lakers' 107-96 loss to Portland Trail Blazers -- Mark Medina, L.A. Times: The Lakers collapsed in the third quarter. Trace everything surrounding the Lakers' 107-96 loss Thursday to the Portland Trail Blazers to the second half. They led, 56-52, at haltime, shot a sizzling 24 of 38 from the field (63.1%) and appeared very comfortable playing at an uncharacteristically fast pace. But that foundation soon fell apart. The Lakers (4-4) were outscored, 32-18. They shot five of 19 from the field. And they had no chance at stopping anyone in transition.
Scott said the young forward told him this was the first time he learned how to play basketball in a lot of different areas, "which I thought was interesting. But I also thought it was great because it meant myself and my staff did a really good job of teaching him how to play the game the right way. That's something for him to take home, learn from and grow from. We're real excited about him coming back. I think he has a lot of room to grow and I think he can still be a very good basketball player for us."

That same year, Bausch's Tanztheater Wuppertal opened the Olympic Arts Festival in Los Angeles. The troupe played regularly in New York, but, despite various efforts, never in Chicago. The harsh, hard-hitting portrayal of human reality — think of the images of painter Egon Schiele alive and on steroids — made her controversial. So did her aesthetic innovations. A onetime student of early 20th-century German expressionist Kurt Jooss, Bausch broke too many rules to count. Her mix of dance and theater often employed movement so everyday, so primal and pedestrian, that many, Croce included, questioned whether it was dancing at all.

In taking those actions, Goodell has argued he was acting to protect the players. But many of his critics noted that the commissioner's previous public support for an 18-game schedule undermines the very concept. And they worry if all the focus on the so-called illegal hits that result from bounty programs is designed to distract attention from the all-too-legal hits that are essential to the game — and the reason the league is facing dozens of lawsuits involving more than 1,500 former players contending it failed to address the dangers of head trauma for years.

The next course, from the a la carte menu, turned out to be my favorite: foie gras chawan mushi, a silken custard flavored with the duck liver and topped with slices of rare duck breast. Palate-cleansing seaweed tea comes next, with a flavor so rich and meaty that I would have sworn it was chicken broth. That paved the way for sushi - six kinds of pristine fish, including toro and snapper with the bright strip of coral skin still attached.

Nevertheless, horse racing's staunch devotion to its roots doesn't seem to be doing it many favors lately. Throughout the sport, there are concerns about track finances, attendance, declining purses and a general erosion of relevance. There are serious inquiries afoot into whether trainers take proper care of the animals and whether jockeys are adequately protected from injury. It's often forgotten that jockeys, who weigh an average of 115 pounds, could become human projectiles when the 1,200-pound beasts they're riding rear up or fall down at speeds near 35 miles per hour.
