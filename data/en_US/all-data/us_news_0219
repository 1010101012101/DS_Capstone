WASHINGTON -- All’s fair in love and war -- and the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. With Washington and media elite in attendance, along with a sprinkling of celebrities, President Obama wasted no time in taking aim at political rivals during his speech, making sure to save some barbs for himself.
At the time of the plea last May, the U.S. Attorney's Office declined to discuss the specifics of their plea agreement with Guarini, or the significant downgrading of charges. Within weeks of Guarini’s plea hearing, Dwek was jailed for lying to his FBI handlers in connection with a rental car that had been reported stolen — and many defense attorneys said at the time that Dwek no longer had much credibility as a witness for the government.
"For some reason, just winning that fourth high jump (title) first means the most to me," she said. "Even though I didn't get the six-foot, I had a record in high jump because of that. Not getting six-foot was really depressing. I would have much rather gotten today than at sectionals. But I guess I can still be happy that I got it."
The move is emblematic of a historic upsurge in Oregon entrepreneurship, with startups attracting outside investment and adding jobs at a pace the state hasn't enjoyed since the dot-com era.
"I wish you could have seen his face," Tammy said, reflexively using the male pronouns that are now commonplace in the family, even when describing these younger years.

Nutritive sweeteners are a source of energy (calories). Some are a natural part of the food we eat such as lactose in dairy foods and fructose in fruit, honey and agave. Some "added sugars" are derived from natural sources. For example, sucrose - half fructose and half glucose "table sugar" - is found in cane and sugar beets.

"Yeah, but they're not me," was Barson's comeback, followed by a momentary quiver of fear that he'd gone too far with the veteran star.
For those reasons, I'm appalled and pained at the exploitation of that good man's name and life in the renaming of 39th Avenue in Portland. The move's self-described Latino advocates and members of the City Council have redefined him in death to be what he never was in life. It's shameful, self-serving exploitation.
Borowski, who led the American League in saves last year with 45, pitched the ninth. He gave up a one-out homer to Jermaine Dye and walked A.J. Pierzynski with two out before retiring Crede for the save. Borowski is 24-for-26 in save situations against the AL Central in the past two years.

The hearing focused on a tiny portion of the $151 billion that Washington has used to prop up the two mortgage finance companies since taking them over as the housing market collapsed. Members of both parties are talking about scaling back or eliminating the two corporations, which have become symbols of squandered tax dollars at a time of mounting budget deficits.

The injury is commonly suffered during weightlifting (as Taylor's was) or when pushing large, heavy forces -- such as linemen on the football field (as Jackson's was). Salata called it a "freak thing" that simply happens when too much force is placed on the pectoral muscle or tendon attaching it to the bone.

My membership card for the Midnight Shopping Brigade is somewhere in the bottom of my purse. I earned "gold" status over the years my family was packing to come and I still had miles of aisles to shop before Thanksgiving dinner. Shopping under stress is no fun. Filling in the blanks early avoids tow-truck calls for jammed carts frozen next to the whipped topping. There is security in a full larder at home.
The economy is expanding, but at a weaker pace than in many previous recoveries. The Commerce Department said earlier this month that the nation's gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of economic output -- grew at a 3 percent annual rate in the January-to-March quarter. That was down from the 5.6 percent pace in the fourth quarter of 2009.

For all its success, The Oregonian has been beset by the same double-barreled dilemma facing nearly every daily newspaper in the country – declining circulation and revenue, the latter made worse by the economic downturn. The paper has downsized, cut salaries and benefits. After a series of buyouts and an expected layoff early next year, the newsroom staff will shrink to pre-1993 levels.
In the 1930s, the Legation Quarter "was Europe in miniature, with European road names and electric streetlights," home to a German hospital, a French jewelry shop and an English tailor, French wrote in his book.
King and others counter that O'Hare is too congested to absorb traffic that connects through Cleveland. Moreover, Continental's Newark hub, a prime entry to Europe, is also maxed out. That should preserve Cleveland's hub role in a United-Continental network, King said.

To learn the flashy stuff, she studied with Carl Chappell, a third-generation cowboy boot maker in St. Jo, Texas. Then she was off and running. She got some good equipment, a few clients and decided that selling $4,500 boots - the average price for a pair with exotic leather or intricate design and involved stitch work - out of her garage wasn't going to cut it.

"It's a government declaration that people are not welcome," said Kimberley Propeack, political director of the group CASA de Maryland, the state's largest immigrant advocacy organization.

Then there’s Bob Woodward, 52, of Morristown. He said he keeps a chart of every Pick 3 and Pick 4 ever played in the state. These days, he’s playing the numbers 5789 in the twice-daily Pick 4 drawing, because his research shows they have not been called since 2009.
But the neighbors didn't know who resided in the house, which sits back from the street behind a large tree. One person said a number of cars were usually parked outside the home. Others said the residents were renters.
New York had been attacked. The Pentagon just outside Washington D.C. had been attacked. Another plane had crashed a relatively short distance away in Pennsylvania. And there were other potential targets all around: the four pinch-point bridges across the Susquehanna River at Havre de Grace, Conowingo Dam, Aberdeen Proving Ground, the public water system, the many nearby nuclear power plants. By midday Sept. 11, 2001, a lot of things that seemed stalwart the day before seemed terribly vulnerable.
"For a district like Granite City, we have a lot of free-and-reduced families. You can't pass that along," said Briggs. "I don't believe you could charge enough to break even" by charging just the higher-income students for bus service.

WASHINGTON -- A determined Republican stall campaign in the Senate has sidetracked so many of the men and women nominated by President Barack Obama for judgeships that he has put fewer people on the bench than any president since Richard Nixon at a similar point in his first term 40 years ago.
ESPN's Corso has minor stroke
That has led to calls to return to the model of a so-called "traditional" marriage and family. Often the term "biblical" is slipped in there, too. I have come to realize that those two adjectives -- traditional and biblical -- mean a wide variety of things depending on the one speaking.
In one sense that's odd, given that without global warming, his energy policy goes from merely misguided to outright bonkers. After all, if you wanted to create non-exportable jobs, wean America off foreign oil or pursue energy independence from the Middle East, absent any concerns about climate change or releasing CO2 into the atmosphere, you would unleash America's massive energy reserves in coal, gas and oil. According to the Congressional Research Service, hardly a mouthpiece for Big Oil, the U.S. has the largest energy resources of any country, Saudi Arabia and Russia included.
I've used Weed & Feed on the lawn and Roundup in the non-lawn areas, trying to eliminate them. The Roundup worked somewhat, but the ones growing in the lawn were unaffected by the Weed & Feed.
The board approved a policy to more aggressively seek minority contractors for university projects. It also approved a University of Oregon project to lease 4.2 acres in Eugene's Riverfront Research Park to construct a 79,800-square-foot building for the Oregon Research Institute and the Educational Policy Center.
That policy doesn't seem to have much sway these days, considering the recent crackdowns by federal authorities on medical marijuana dispensaries in California and Colorado. But even if it were still in effect, the vagueness of state law and conflicting judicial interpretations make it well nigh impossible for anyone in California to be in clear and unambiguous compliance. That's because Proposition 215, the 1996 measure that decriminalized the medicinal use of marijuana, and SB 420, the 2003 law to clarify its provisions, left far too many loose ends.
Question: What does the legislation do for ordinary folk?

That's a term used by Taco Bell executives to describe the next generation. It picked up the term Gen Wii, executives say, in consultations with MTV.
James has said he played more out of anger and to silence criticism than anything else last season. So this season, his mindset changed, with him trying to revert to old ways, first as a superstar-in-waiting at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, then during his seven seasons with the Cavaliers.

"In the age of the Internet, there's no excuse for that," said Lisa McGiffert, director of Consumers Union's national Safe Patient Project. "The old reports should remain, and they should be marked by date."
The higher up the spinal cord damage, the more neurological functions a patient could potentially lose, Mroz said, explaining that the major nerves of the body branch off the spinal cord at each junction.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a high-profile critic of Obama administration border policies, acknowledged that the government buildup has had some positive results, but he said there remains more to be done to secure the border. Overall, the measures still have not "kept up with the escalation of violence on the other side of the border," which poses a threat to the United States, McCain said. Fencing and technology is still insufficient and a larger National Guard presence is needed at the border, he said.

The most evocative early image is David Gill's "The Great Comet of 1882," a famous skinny wedge of light smeared across a speckled sheet. The dramatic comet, especially visible in the Southern Hemisphere, was a night-sky event that captured the imagination over the course of many months. Gill photographed it from Cape Town, South Africa.

These rights and responsibilities are found in all faiths. In the Quran, Hazrat Yahya (John the Baptist) is mentioned as being "kind towards his parents, not tough and disobedient". Obedience does not mean mindless following of a parent's wishes or requests, but it does give the parent a right of deference to their opinion, as a parent has the wisdom of experience when it comes to guiding their children through the various decisions they will have to make.
Except, it turned out, he wasn’t. A studio release, “King of the Hill,” left audiences cold; a series of uncompromising independent films — “Kafka,” “The Underneath,” “Schizopolis,” “Gray’s Anatomy” — came and went without a ripple. And then he got an offer to direct a crime picture called “Out of Sight.”
The trial judge in the case of a mentally ill woman who is suing the Chicago Police Department said today a recent court ruling allowing the case to go forward may actually lead to more delays.
"Remember the Titans" (2000): There are other ways to be bad-ass than with a gun or your fists. Take Herman Boone, the real-life coach of a Virginia high school Washington plays here. With segregation ending in 1971, Boone coaches a team with White and Black players. It's a tall order, but he and, eventually, the team stand up to and overcome prejudice and injustice -- and he works the players' tails off, leading to great success.

One of his patients, Nadine Oswald, 53, has taken several food sensitivity tests over the years to see if dietary changes could help with chronic fatigue, sinus congestion and gastrointestinal problems. She said the last test she took, which Mullin ordered, looked at whether she was allergic to or intolerant of 157 foods. The company billed her more than $5,000 for the tests, and her insurance company has refused to approve the benefit.

The City remains committed to respecting free speech as well as maintaining the City's responsibility to protect public health and safety. Peaceful daytime assembly will continue to be allowed between 6 am and 10 pm daily, but no camping or overnight stays will be permitted. There may be some disruption to the Plaza during the time that it takes to clean it up and ensure that the Plaza poses no health and safety hazard from those choosing to protest. The City of Oakland's goal is to clean it up to facilitate free assembly in the Plaza as soon as practical.
Qwest is just 14 years old, born of the frenzied dot-com days and the overheated thirst for bandwidth capacity.
Solar companies covet private land for another reason. If a renewable energy project on public or private property compromises habitat for endangered species, the developer must buy biologically suitable private land to account for that loss. The Ivanpah Solar Project, for example, requires that Oakland-based developer BrightSource buy 7,000 acres to replace habitat for the threatened desert tortoise.
Hunt's political aide Adam Smith resigned Wednesday, saying he was responsible for the perception that News Corp. had "too close a relationship" with Hunt's office. Smith said he had acted without Hunt's authorization, but it was not clear how a special adviser could have acted so independently.
Springboard allowed the school to experiment with a new living model for students and develop programs to reduce attrition, she said.
Williams throws in some strange humor in the story mix as well. Take "The Struggle for Life," in which Brampton, on the hunt for a suspect with a tendency toward "cataleptic" fits, lodges at a tavern on the condition that he must spend the night sleeping next to a fresh corpse. Then there is the opening to "The Night of Peril," in which Brampton dryly explains in understated fashion that "[o]f course it is to be expected that in a life like mine I should often be exposed to danger of a personal character; it is the lot of all detective officers, and I have been no exception to the rule." And hey, even detective officers have to socialize, so why not include Herman Melville, fresh off of " Moby-Dick" and "Bartleby the Scrivener" as occasional host of Brampton and his "capital fellows" meeting on a weekly basis "relating adventures, telling stories and playing chess"? Unfortunately, Williams gets a little too carried away with his depiction of Brampton's pals, for after leaf 18, he turns the action away from the detective officer to the supporting players -- complete with epigraphs on their importance as submitted by J.B. It's all well and good to read about a random young lawyer's unusual first case in "My First Brief"; or learn in "The Story of a Pack of Cards" how that object ends up getting a young doctor married, but I'm left to wonder if Williams was told he didn't have enough material for a book with Brampton alone and felt the need to pad his wares.
Lucinda Jesson, the state Department of Human Services (DHS) commissioner, said that the incidents point to the need for new leadership in her agency's services division, where all of the employees involved worked. "We need to raise the bar on the level of care we provide for clients and make sure we have the highest value for taxpayers," she said.
CINCINNATI — The Cubs had only five save opportunities in the month of April, the second fewest in the majors behind the Padres' four chances.
ø"While it is undoubtedly true that al Qaeda was seeking to establish an offensive bioweapons program in 2001 , Task Force agents were unable to find any link between al Qaeda and the letter attacks in the United States, or even that, at the time of the attacks, any al Qaeda operatives had access to the type and quality of anthrax pathogen used in the 2001 attacks," says the FBI's investigative summary of the case.

The event at the Wolstein Center will be Obama's third trip to Cleveland State University. He debated Hillary Clinton there during the 2008 Democratic presidential primary and held a rally there before last November's election.
But by the time this story begins in earnest, the men in Ora's life have rendered her affections obsolete. Ilan has divorced her, taking her older son with him on a bachelors' romp through South America, and younger son Ofer is so loyal to the state (and ignorant of Ora's emotional ordeal) that he cancels a long-planned hiking trip with his mother — mere days after the conclusion of his official military service — to voluntarily reenlist for an emergency operation. Avram, who was captured and tortured by the Egyptians in 1973's Yom Kippur War, now registers as a spectral figure, distant and peripheral. But her bags are packed, and she won't go alone. In what registers as the Middle Eastern equivalent of a John Ford western, a feverish Ora forces Avram to follow her to their land's geographic and metaphysical borders, where our vulnerable, oversharing Scheherazade reconstructs the lives of her two sons — the ones Avram has never met — out of a patchwork of intimate remembrances.
Even a deal with Cadence, he said, could be problematic because it would leave the industry dominated by two companies that each control about 19 percent of the industry today.
White says he plans to unveil his own reform plan in response to The Mind Trust next week.

The decision came today, setting off the second major search of the month.
Abraham compared the front of the building to the falling blade of a guillotine, and indeed much of his work was suffused with a sense of foreboding. The building opened just months after the destruction of the World Trade Center towers, and perhaps more than any other piece of architecture of the period it seemed to capture the heavy, fragmented and fragile mood of New York City and fix it permanently in architectural space.
The story of "Saga" is not one of an all-out intergalactic war though, but instead one of many small proxy wars fought by many different people at the behest, and payment, of two specific groups. The people of the planet Wreath and its moon Landfall know they can't destroy the home of their enemy since it would mean their own destruction, but are more than happy to pay others to provide them with battlegrounds and troops far from their home worlds.

I will be honest. I'm not afraid to tell people how much work needs to be done on my body. I put the numbers out there and will continue to do so. And, if there is a day when I ignore the plan and eat a box of Oreo cookies, I will admit it. I'm fortunate to be busy with a family and job and other commitments, so I'm sure I won't be able to get everything in. That's good, in a sense, because I don't want readers to think I've got 24/7 to devote to this effort. I'm no different than a lot of people in that way.

Health problems, including a heart condition that required Paul to undergo a quintuple bypass in 1980, sidelined him again for several years until 1984, when he began a Monday night residency at the New York jazz club, Fat Tuesday's.

Iannucci says he wanted to avoid ridiculing his characters. "They're not goofy, they're not idiots. It's more the nature of the office that places them in that situation. In the end, the comedy is not about portraying these people as fools. They're just people. But why is it that the process has turned into something where whatever you do, it just comes out the wrong way? It looks bad. And then, you start with the fear of looking bad, so you're trying to cover up."
Like the service, the cuisine is also a little schizophrenic. Pasteur employs a Vietnamese chef, Amy's ex-husband and original Pasteur chef Dan Nguyen, and also a traditional French chef, Eric Aubriot (formerly Aubriot, Tournesol and a whole host of others).

However, at Pasteur, there is no gentle fusion of the two approaches, but rather a very distinct line of confusion.

And perched above the Chavon, one will stumble upon a lordly, 17th century Spanish Colonial town forged out of stone called Altos De Chavon (where a decidedly more modern 600-person club is opening soon). Yet. Altos De Chavon is not a 17th century Colonial town. It is an elaborate re-creation (although not really of any town in particular) built in the 1970s by Paramount executive Charles Bluhdorn — though it is certainly more ornate than anything one would find at Epcot Center. If you didn’t know any better, it could fool you into thinking it was real.

Bahama Breeze: You can't see the Caribbean from this spot on the causeway, but you can hear the islands and get a taste of them here. Lively music makes waits on the veranda more fun. Drinks are mixed with tropical spirits, and meats and fish are done up with fire and spice.

Hey, Marty: I think it's a rather underwhelming class. I could list one player at each position whom I like, but there's not one who stands above the rest, in my opinion.

I also love the mussels Mamie Tourenne ($9), named after Ouvrard's mother, where the steamed shells are tossed with bits of prosciutto, garlic, shallots, tiny crunchy croutons, butter and sherry vinegar to make a rich, dark sauce.

All are fighting to sell their wine in a tough market. Growth for methode champenoise domestic wines hovers around 3 to 5 percent per year, according to industry analyst Jon Fredrikson of Gomberg, Fredrikson & Associates. But that trails overall industry growth, and even with the weak dollar, it's only pacing growth in the market for French Champagne. Part of the problem is that sparkling wine remains a seasonal purchase, and demand has cooled since the Champagne houses began planning these projects in the 1970s.

The Indians opened their season by going 1-2 in a home series against the Toronto Blue Jays. Three early-season games mean little within the context of a 162-game major league season (actually, for the Indians-Blue Jays series, it was more like a four-game series when counting the eight extra innings). Thus, it doesn't mean much that Cleveland hitters had just 18 hits in 118 at bats for a .153 batting average against Toronto.

Given that Cuyahoga County taxpayers help support the land bank via penalties and interest on delinquent land taxes, it simply is unacceptable that the land bank board would try to insulate itself from outside oversight.

Still, even if U.S. diplomacy is a legitimate response to this peculiarly insidious form of propaganda, it clearly isn't a sufficient response. Far more significant, and surely more effective, would be a unified response from the rest of the world's Muslims, the vast majority of whom do not share Saudi views and occasionally say so. It would be useful, for us but especially for them, if they would say so more often and more loudly. The United States, of course, is not a Muslim nation, and Americans cannot by themselves orchestrate a meaningful Muslim response to Saudi extremism. But we do have a large Muslim population, we do have friends in the moderate Muslim world and we do have some money -- mostly wasted -- to spend on public diplomacy. ...Make sure that children in Iraq, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and in Islamic schools all around the world have decent fourth-grade textbooks. Help persuade the Muslim world to write and distribute them. It might save a lot of trouble a few years later on.

The Lakers executed that game plan, holding the Nuggets to 88 points on 35.6% shooting. That was due partly to the vast amount of preparation by Coach Mike Brown. The shortened NBA season hardly allowed that to happen beforehand. After Brown tried to squeeze in as much practice time as possible in the first two months of the season, players soon tired of the information overload as fatigue hit them. Meanwhile, it proved harder to grasp scouting information when there's less time to scout for it, teach it and execute it against multiple opponents.

A week ago, there were six candidates still standing in the GOP race. Now, though technically there are four, including former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, the Republican race is the two-person contest that many once anticipated.

Not to me. My affinity for brown suits started early, in high school, when I discovered two brown suits—one in light wool, another in linen—at a local thrift store. I dropped them at the dry cleaners and then made my acorn-hued debut at a pal's house party. Amidst the flock of preppie peacocks—'80s East Coast kids in pink Polo shirts with upturned collars and Kelly green wide wales—I stood out in the crowd, brawny in ballsy brown. The girls took notice. I was now the erudite adult in a room of pool-playing boys, a collective bag of Skittles.
When the car slid off the road - "like it was on ice," we heard later - it briefly went airborne and flew across a tree stump, which tore the transmission and gear box from the chassis.

The upside of Tebow running the Wildcat, which coach Rex Ryan also likes as an offensive weapon, could be significant.

The fate of the health care bill is in the hands of the Supreme Court with the focus directly on the funding of the bill; that is, the mandate that everyone buy in and participate in the program. The question, of course (in simplified terms), is whether the federal government can require the purchase of a specific product. If the Supreme Court decides the government does not have the authority to mandate participation, can the health care bill, or parts of it, survive, or will the removal of this one part of the bill decimate the entire program?

When Christmas morning came - surprise! It turned out that my husband had purchased everything on my list, and I had purchased everything on his. But how, when we had no money? Credit, of course!

The result is a depth of talent at this year's World Cup that makes winning all the more challenging.

My favorite is the Sarusa ($20), where the rice forms a perfect ring around poached shrimp, avocado and lemon zest. A Dungeness crab "salsa" with bits of herbs and tomato tops each of the eight pieces.

Last summer the medical journal The Lancet reported that if we don't blunt the fattening of America, half of all adults will be obese by 2030. Yet the government interventions that study suggested -- such as regulating the way unhealthy foods are marketed, taxing less-healthy food options such as sugary soda and salty snacks, and subsidizing fruits and vegetables to make them more affordable than bags of Cheetos -- are nowhere near becoming a reality because of those fearful of the nanny state and their corporate backers.

Before then, people figured a little extra weight might help withstand infectious diseases that vaccines and antibiotics later would tame. It also was a sign of prosperity.

Increasing prosperity meant easier access to food.

Even in Los Angeles, though, open space is not eternal. Neither are parking lots, however hardy some of them have proved as urban specimens in this city.

The friends and people that I've put into my life now, they know what happened to me. But before they learned about my past, they knew who I was. They had already fallen in love with me.

This brings us to the second number, 74—the longest lifespan enjoyed by a one-party regime in history, that of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1917-1991). One-party rule in Mexico had only a slightly shorter history, 71 years (1929-2000). In Taiwan, the Kuomintang maintained power for 73 years if we count its time as the ruler of the war-torn mainland before it fled to Taiwan in 1949.
Contrary to many published reports (and even some consolidators' websites), consolidators do not generally "buy in bulk" and resell tickets to the public. Instead, they contract for access to seats in special fare "buckets" and seat inventories designated specifically for consolidators. But they actually buy tickets, one at a time, only after their customers have paid. This is important because virtually all of the problems consumers have with consolidators arise because of glitches that occur between the time a retail agent takes the money and the time the consolidator actually buys the ticket.
Bar said the investigation had found "widespread and, in our judgment, inexcusable breakdowns in basic controls. The problems must be fixed."
On record, Screaming Females can convey a sui generis inventiveness that makes the group hard to place in a rock ’n’ roll context, but live, the roots of the band’s sound — surging surf-rock riffs, ’90s indie-rock soloing, pop tropes — come to the fore. On the new “Something Ugly,” Paternoster snarled “yeah, yeah, yeah” in a nuclear mutation of the Beatles, while the elegant melody that wrapped around the hook of “Rotten Apple” recalled Dinosaur Jr.’s J Mascis at his most tuneful.

Salvador is the former port of entry for Brazil's slaves, and 80 percent of Salvador's population is of African ancestry. I could hear it in the music, taste it in the palm-oil-seasoned food, and see it in the colorful costumes of the Bahianas - women street vendors who sell acarejé, or deep-fried bean cakes. But perhaps the most exotic African influence is in the religion, which twins Yoruban deities with Catholic saints. In New Orleans and Haiti, they call it Voodoo. In Salvador, it's Candomblé.
And the evening's top-billed attraction -- the Pleasure Seekers -- is still a go, despite the absence of Quatro, who will speak via prerecorded video.

Gil Mantera's Party Dream started living the rock-star life in Youngstown, Ohio, way back in 1998, fueled by a love of New Order and Devo and an unabashed appetite for Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. Brothers Gil Mantera and Ultimate Donny treated the whole thing as joke - at first - playing really bad retro '80s synth-pop, and compensating for their lack of musical talent by making jackasses of themselves onstage. This mostly involved stripping down to their skivvies and beating each other bloody.

øThis app's special appeal is that it teaches kids about emotions. Using adorable animated zoo animals in search-and-find games, kids learn to look for details about the 19 featured animals. In addition to the animals' names, kids will learn to look for visual cues that show if someone is angry, surprised, crying or happy, or whether they are waving, winking, sleeping and eating. This is a great conversation-started for parents and can lead to hilarious games about shaping your face into different emotions.

Kristie: My favorite question! Long story short: I have a degree in theater and had been on stage since the age of 5. When I graduated I felt a bit empty and gross, like I was stuck in someone else's life. Since I was little, my secret dream was to study animals in Africa like Jane Goodall. So at 22 I chucked acting and went to Kenya on a study-abroad trip. I had only taken one entomology course but the professor's enthusiasm changed the way I saw the world. He gave me my "small eyes" to see the tiny creatures. In Africa, the insects and arachnids blew my mind. I always say that insects and spiders chose me. I was open to the experience of learning and I never looked back. When I realized that I could combine my communication skills with my love of arthropods -- BAM! The Bug Chicks were born.

Because of his off-field persona that some might classify as lukewarm, Ward got into very little trouble when he was at FSU. Aside from poking fun at his interception totals - No. 17 had 17 his junior season - the presenters had very little they really could hold over his head. Each person who came to the podium admitted at some point, in some form or fashion, "I really don't know how to roast Charlie, because there's not much to roast him about."

A companion and I shared the big Chinois Chicken Salad ($10), a decently executed version of a dish popular at Puck's famous Chinois on Main in Santa Monica, Calif. I happened to have shared the salad there, back in the 1980s, and this local offering stands up handsomely. It plays well alongside bites of a thin-crust, stone-oven Wild Mushroom Pizza ($10) loaded with caramelized onions but with too few mushroom slices, glazed with fragrant melted Gruyere. Service was crisp and friendly. Stand in line, order, and your food is delivered to your table -- unless you prefer takeout.
