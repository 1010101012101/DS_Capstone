The Republicans will hope that, having given them control of at least one house of Congress, you will also give them all kinds of slack to "govern according to political realities."

Providence always has prided itself on being different. The city was founded in 1636 by Roger Williams, after he was booted from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. His crime? Radical thinking, if you consider the separation of church and state a radical idea. That dedication to religious freedom endures. Providence houses the first Baptist Church in America. The country's oldest Quaker meeting house and oldest synagogue are located in Newport, 30 minutes away. The city celebrates cultural diversity, too, with thriving Italian, Jewish, Portuguese and Irish neighborhoods.

That doesn't mean there aren't other trade-offs. Mostly to make room for a larger battery, the new iPad weighs about 8% more and is about 7% thicker than the prior model. That means the company can't claim to have the thinnest and lightest tablet, as it boasted last year with the iPad 2. (It's still thinner and lighter than the original iPad.)

"They've been able to stay above everything else," he said. "They've been able to stay above the fact that it's a game and team that has eluded us for a long time. They've been able to stay above the fact that it's Johns Hopkins. They've been able to stay above the emotion of playing a top-ranked opponent. To them, it's the next game on the schedule. So that's where I would start as a coach, and that's why we've continued to have success. They've prepared the same way week in and week out. They're not preparing for a jersey, but they're preparing for an opponent. Obviously for the university, it's a huge game. It's a sellout atmosphere here at Ridley and it's the reason we built this facility, to play games like this. It's going to be an exciting day."

This is one component of Issue 2 that should be rethought if the measure passes. Another is the ban on public-employee strikes -- already rare in Ohio -- that also would distort bargaining. Finally, the General Assembly would need to excise provisions -- notably a ban on collecting "fair share" dues from bargaining unit members who refuse to join the union, but reap the benefits of representation -- that organized labor views as a threat to its existence. Such a ban is needless -- and needlessly provocative.

Some yacht designers and brokers describe "A" as too futuristic and aggressive for the leisurely world of yachting. "Initially I was very skeptical," says Jonathan Beckett, chief executive of London-based Burgess, the yacht broker. "When you just see photos, it's a very strange-looking boat. But when I saw it cruising in the Caribbean this year, I have to say I was impressed. It's a very exciting boat to watch. It's simply unlike anything that's ever been done before."

Everything comes out of the two of us practicing and playing together, coming up with riffs and rhythms.”

Santa Monica College officials say that Cal Grants and private donations to a special fund will cover the added cost for low-income students, so that this would not become an option only for the affluent. But Cal Grants, which provide financial aid to low- and moderate-income California families, are based on the type of college the students attend. Students at community colleges receive a certain stipend, University of California students another, and so forth. There are some supplemental funds students can apply for, but it's not clear that Cal Grants would provide them for this purpose. The program can't cover students' expenses if every community college in the state starts quadrupling the price of its most popular classes. If private donors step forward, Santa Monica College should use their money to fund classes at the regular price.

Any analysis of the race's impact needs to be tempered with the knowledge that it is the first year of a five-year commitment. We can't expect it to be as successful in its first run as it is in its fifth, and the city's investment in money and hassle was heavily front-loaded. But we do need to avoid a repeat of the Washington Grand Prix, which went so badly that the city and race officials pulled the plug after the first year. The race doesn't need to be a "game changer" for Baltimore, as the mayor once suggested, in order to be considered a success. It just needs to bring in enough money to compensate the city for its expenses and residents for their inconvenience.

Yes, I typically do these mental calculations, at least in the back of my mind, for most things. A "$50" lunch at Morton's really costs $200. A "$5,000" trip to Bali: $20,000. And so on. It tends to cut down on the spending. I typically come back from the mall with no bags, gleefully clutching my future millions.

In populating such a richly rendered world, Edugyan allows a few details to slip through the cracks.

"If we have one shot, we don't find the rebound, we don't have second guy who goes to the net and tries to find the rebound. It's the kind of game when you have to score some dirty goals like from rebound or from a tip," said Ovechkin, who finished with seven shots in 22:34 of ice time.

The attack Sunday also raises questions about the administration's plan to begin a shift from leading the combat to undertaking an advisory mission this year.

Though the Blue Velvet consists of only three ingredients, its creamy blue tint and intoxicating, floral aroma is entirely unique. The drink uses Cold River Blueberry, a Maine potato vodka, as its "blue" base. Tart and fresh, it's the perfect complement to the candy-like liqueur.

"We're seeing a lot of winter boots with an open toe and towering high heels," Steele says.

Perhaps the most persuasive speaker is a man whose testimony was not allowed at the trial. That would be social psychologist Richard Ofshe, professor emeritus at UC Berkeley and an expert at the ways police psychologically influence confessions. To hear him calmly and persuasively walk us through the ways that intimidation works and then to see it unfold in front of us is eye-opening.

Huntington Beach Park, Lake Road, Bay Village, 216-351-6300: This lovely Bay Village beach just earned a top honor: It's the first beach along Lake Erie to receive the Blue Wave seal from the Clean Beaches Coalition of Washington D.C. The honor is given to beaches that are deemed to have superior water quality, accessibility, safety practices, habitat conservation, maintenance and proactive erosion management. But that's not all. Huntington Beach also has sprawling lawns, picnic areas and a breakwall for fishing, plus a Mitchell's Ice Cream stand and the Baycrafters gallery, just across the street, with its chic mix of local arts and crafts.

The IPAB is also likely to start lowering payment rates for drug plans under Medicare Advantage and Part D. Doing so would push out drug providers, leaving fewer treatment options for patients. Here in Maryland, 44 percent of Medicare recipients have Part D drug coverage. That means close to 400,000 local seniors could see their benefits drop as a result of the IPAB.

"Not only would a stronger bonding bill address economic needs at the present time, but currently, interest rates are low. This means that taxpayers would be getting more for their dollar. Looking to the future, we need to focus on passing a more extensive bonding bill that will create jobs and invest in our state’s infrastructure, providing vast opportunities for economic growth,” she said. She voted against the measure Saturday.

"One thing I feel with our players is you don't have to tell them. You don't have to motivate them," Bennett said. "They've tasted it. They've felt the sting of not winning. They've felt the joy and the pride of winning the league. They understand both ends of it. They're self-motivated and they want to be good. That solves a lot of problems in coaching."

It has a built-in wood-chip smoker box, retractable rotisserie, searing burner and lighted control knobs. "It's a beautiful thing," says Mrs. Pieczynski of Frankfort, Ill., who insists she'll be doing most of the grilling. "If you cook in your house all of your life, this isn't any different."

One potential selection -- Sen. Rob Portman -- might seem to contradict what Goldstein wrote about the myth. Portman is from Ohio, the quadrennial swing state in recent times. But Goldstein also notes that Portman, a veteran member of Congress and former White House budget director, is a heavyweight probably viewed as having White House mettle.
(This is the interactive portion of today's column where you get to say the Browns should wait until next year to grab USC's Matt Barkley -- as if that would be any easier than acquiring RGIII; and where I remind you that if they're bad enough through November to project at the top of the draft again next year, we should all hope the Mayans are right. If only so we can rebuild this mess from the ground up starting with single-cell organisms. What's another 10 million years or so when you've been waiting since 1964?)

I have chickadees and house finches, sparrows and woodpeckers, all performing their Olympic feats: swooping, landing and balancing on perches of the feeders. The mourning doves race across the garden bed for the choice sunflower seeds.

The players are on high alert around Goodell for legitimate reasons. But it's not just the players who think Goodell is heavy handed. Some NFL owners feel the same. Nonsensical decisions like this one invite criticism from both sides, not to mention hypothetical scenarios.

10. "Boardwalk Empire" (HBO): Still uneven in its second season, the Roaring '20s drama nonetheless remains an intoxicating brew about Prohibition and the price of power. Atlantic City kingpin Nucky Thompson (Steve Buscemi) regained control of the town and beat the legal rap against him, but it would be a stretch to suggest that all is right with his volatile world. The series certainly set itself challenges for the third season, killing off such popular characters as Angela (Aleksa Palladino), the Commodore (Dabney Coleman) and Jimmy (Michael Pitt).

The voices of the children playing provided a wonderful backdrop to what I really wanted to do: just wander around. At the Rivard Plaza, you can look one direction and see the RenCen, parking structures, etc., and know youre downtown.

Freighters go by. People are out fishing in smaller boats and from the shore. A school field trip departs on a boat tour. Pure Michigan is right here, where office workers can soak it up on their lunch hour and families can bring their kids to play anytime.

Devotees of man-on-the-spot military histories are wiling to accept the rough edges in presentation because the stories are so compelling. In "Joker One," though, the storytelling is smooth and professional. Campbell writes with precision where he can, with a brisk pace, with humor and with a deep understanding of the men he commanded. The book is full of character sketches that make his noncommissioned officers and some of his enlisted men real people, with distinctive, endearing and annoying qualities, rather than pawns on history's chessboard.

"Republicans in Congress were going so far as to say an employer should be able to have a say in the healthcare decisions of its female employees," Obama said. "I'm always puzzled by this -- this is a party that says it prides itself on being rabidly anti-regulation. These are folks who claim to believe in freedom from government interference and meddling.

There was too a spiritual dimension to this derring-do at the top of the world, a collision and mingling of cultures as the children of the Raj met mystical Tibet.

Much of the tumult an IPO creates has to do with the so-called "lockup period" that keeps company insiders from selling stock within the first six months after going public.

At the start of the last century, the landscape architect -- nephew and adopted son of the legendary Frederick Law Olmsted, designer of New York's Central Park -- mapped out Portland's parks system and suggested that the city buy a lush wooded stretch of the West Hills for future use and preservation.
