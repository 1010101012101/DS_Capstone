It's like pulling a blanket over you when you're cold, or getting into a warm bath. That feeling of security and peace. In times of trouble - no matter what it is, from turbulence on a plane to the London riots - this song always pops into my head and I must seek it out and hear it at once. And then I feel better.
Crispy treats are a very popular thing with kids. I don't have to say it twice, when I am offering crispy treats to the kids at my house, they both run at once :-)

We popped into Mothercare today, just as we happened to be around, and had fun browsing all their toys in the Early Learning Centre. I heard my other half call my name, and I turned round to see he had put a child’s dressing up cowboy hat on Henry’s head. He just looked too cute! It was a mixture of ‘aww’ and ‘haha’. We decided to get it for him, as the photos alone are worth the four pounds.
It was March in the Enduromat camp. The senior citizens of the camp had one and at most 2 more winters to endure. By the time the next winter came, some would have likely left to see the world. Like any community, there was a hierarchy here as well. That said, animals mixed freely with each other, and while they were in the camp, all natural enmities were forgotten. The polar bear did not try and eat the seals, the orcas left the narwhals alone and the elks were secure in the knowledge that they wouldn’t be chased by the other predators of the Tundra.
The witching houre is upon us, and we must make haste to the darkest shadowes of the place known as Low Life, there to make ceremony with the gather’d spirits of All Hallowes Eve. ’Tis verily a supermarket of the supernatural.

Now, I am fully aware that living on an island is not like vacationing on an island but when Cristina spoke the words, “You know we are hiring…” I had to work to resist the urge to test her sincerity. Sure, I do not speak Spanish, but I cannot think of a better way to learn! But sadly there is no Bikram yoga on Cozumel and its absence would have soon been felt. Even so, if it were not for my commitment to my job, a lease and a cat I may well have stayed a wee bit longer.
Ok there is more but I will save those for later, Happy Reading!!!
So, why Rwanda? Why now? Well, after what essentially works out as 18 years of working my arse off academically in one form or another, I couldn’t put it off any longer…it is time to get a job! But, on the advice of my parents I decided that taking one last trip while I still have the freedom to do so, was absolutely necessary. As my mum is so fond of saying “you’re at work a long time”. Rwanda has always held some fascination for me, I don’t really know why, but writing an assignment on the country just increased this. My dad knows a guy who went on a mountain biking trip there, and he put me in contact with a Rwandese business man. So, as of Thursday I will be spending 3 weeks working with him in his travel agency, and then 3 weeks travelling.

Next up, I made my way from the PFA in Berkeley to the Castro for TWIXT. Francis Ford Coppola has thrown his hat into the 3-D ring and returned to genre filmmaking (has it really been 20 years since his version of DRACULA?) As well as making an oddly personal film. Actually, he only uses 3D in two scenes, kind of a throwback to some of the classic 3D schlock pictures, and really I don't think the 3D was necessary at all, but it was fun. The movie itself is an immaculately crafted surreal tale of a moderately successful horror writer Hall Baltimore (Val Kilmer) and his strange dream-world adventures in Swan Valley, a fictional small town in Northern California (actually, I'm not sure if they establish where it was, but it was shot is NoCal and the fact they had In-N-Out there establishes it as somewhere in the west.) He's there for a book signing, but there's no bookstore so he signs at the hardware store. And he only signs one book--for the local sheriff/aspiring horror writer (Bruce Dern) who convinces him to stay and collaborate on a tru-ish story about a local serial killer with vampiric overtones. In fact, legend has it the whole town is haunted, and there's some pretty weird stuff. Motorcycle riding goth teens across the lake who might be evil. A seven-faced clock tower with no two faces telling the same time. Ghosts, a legend of a child-murderer, and Edgar Allan Poe as a guide. They might all be there, or they might all be a dream. Back in the real world he's got a wife nagging him to get and advance or she'll sell his rare copy of Leaves of Grass, and a publisher demanding a foolproof idea, complete with an outline and a dynamite ending. In tone, it veers from classic horror to melancholy to dark humor to very personal tragedy (there's a plot element that's eerily similar to Coppola's own son's death in a boating accident.) I'm not really convinced that it works as a pure genre piece. And I'm less convinced that it works as some dark satire or deconstruction of genre literature/filmmaking. But it does work simply as Coppola playing around, and if that seems indulgent, well Coppola has earned that.
Obama was an alleged constitutional law professor; he taught on the subject and he is so wrong on so many levels in the statement he made yesterday. We simply have got to take a long, hard look at his law school records to see just what kind of constitutional lawyer he says he is.
Callinan is an antipodean Johnny Marr in Patrick Wolf’s clothing, while Thom Moors plays the part of Morrissey, a poetic and self-assured frontman. The Smiths are but one reference point of Mercy Arms, an album that owes as much to Cohen’s Eighties alumni as it does to one of the greatest ever exponents of reverb, My Bloody Valentine.
Some rural communities with high amenity values have developed alternative economies as sites for tourism and retirement. For most communities, however, the decoupling from the larger economy has been an intractable socio-economic problem, and rural communities continue to lag behind urban areas.
Here's a photo of our little "Citrus Grove" (plus 1 additional Key Lime tree hiding off to the right side here.) These are dwarf trees and we bought 5 gallon sized trees 5 - yes FIVE - years ago. We've had a few Mandarin Oranges, several Meyer Lemons the last 3 years. The first year we had nothing, of course. When we bought them, the Nursery Man at OSH told us, "they'll do just fine in this area! And, they'll quickly grow to the 6' to 8' size we'd like to keep them at in no time at all." He fibbed just a little bit - well, actually he fibbed a BIG WHOPPER!! This guys pants caught on fire!! Citrus Trees don't do well in an area where we have so many nights that freeze - only low to mid 20's, and many, many nights under 32 degrees. So, not just frosts or quick freeze, but a hard freeze for these tender trees.
Not one to be deterred, Gaunty (as the rabid bigot is jauntily titled) went to the High Court in order to challenge the OFCOM ruling, perhaps rightly sniffing some sort of martyrdom status amongst the particularly thick and myopic individuals that make up his fan base.

The waiter was old and gruff. The menu was enormous. There were dishes that were vaguely German and dishes that were vaguely Spanish, and the usual gamut of Argentine meats and pastas.

It’s not clear if Hillsong would include dubstep among God’s tools, but Jon Bulack – a young producer from Philadelphia, USA who has done remixes of Hillsong tracks – definitely does. He’s known by many names, including THREE:SIXTEEN, DevoShun, and Poppin’ Jon (in his incarnation as a hip-hop dancer). His adoption of the name THREE:SIXTEEN is clearly a reference to John 3:16, perhaps the most frequently cited summary of the Christian faith: “For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life.” Jon comments prolifically on his YouTube channel and videos and makes it clear that his Christianity deeply inspires his artistic expression and his relations with other people, frequently warmly thanking positive commenters and saying “God bless you.” Some quotes that demonstrate how fundamental the union of dubstep and Christianity is for Jon include:
HENRY JAGLOM: Yep, I acted in a film he directed called, DRIVE, HE SAID. We made a deal prior, that we'd act in each others first movies. So by the time I got the opportunity to direct my first movie, A SAFE PLACE, Jack was the biggest star in the country. He was getting a million dollars a movie by this time. So I couldn't afford him, but we had a deal. So he did my first movie, for a color television that he really liked.
Perhaps Natcos' baby step in this regard may pave the way for a giant leap of sorts, where many more drug patents are subjected to this "stick" so as to help bring down what are by most standards, highly excessive prices for a country like India. In fact, given that more than 90% of MNC drugs are imported into India, this order may pave the way for wholesale compulsory licenses to be issued against a wide spectrum of drugs in the near future. This interpretation of "working" to mean "local working" (local manufacture within India) may in fact prove the most controversial part of the order and may perhaps attract a TRIPS challenge as well.
Indeed God has many reasons for the church, the body of Christ to be on earth for truly He is working in mysterious ways, working out the administration of His secret purpose.
This does Atonement teach, and demonstrates the Oneness of God’s Son is unassailed by his belief he knows not what he is. Today accept Atonement, not to change reality, but merely to accept the truth about yourself, and go your way rejoicing in the endless Love of God. It is but this that we are asked to do. It is but this that we will do today.
Fast forward to late this afternoon. The nurse calls me because the doctor signed off on everything. I have to go on some medication for the thyroid, get an u/s on it, and follow up with a endocrinologist. She looked back in my records and discovered that I had thryoid testing back in June of 2004, just 5 months before I got pregnant with my four year old son, Raleigh. And my thyroid levels were even higher then than they are now. I was never told about it or treated...it was basically forgotten. So now I'm angry and upset. I have no idea what to think, but I do know I am grateful for not beng pregnant right now. I know that His plan continues, and for whatever reason, this is all a part of it.

If Mr. Ellsworth had read my article more carefully, he would have observed that I, too, objected to current sensational attempts to blame the comic books for juvenile delinquency.

Mr. Ellsworth does not even attempt to answer this point.

When dispelling magics that are not recently created by another caster, the GM should apply situational DMs to a Magical Strength check depending upon the strength of the magic the character is attempting to dispel. A weak magic may have a DM of +2 while a powerful dweomer may have a -6 or even higher. Typical magics are considered +0 to dispel. Additionally, the dispelling character must spend additional Magical Strength points equal to the negative DM of the check if it is of above average difficulty. For example, a Very Difficult (-4) dispelling attempt requires the character spend an additional 4 points of Magical Strength when the dispel is completed. Only a single attempt to dispel can be made in this way - if failed, the character can never dispel the magic.

Answer: Of course, but so are the lives of thousands that got bombs dropped on their heads without ever taking up arms with intent to take American life. It’s my belief that life is precious regardless of nationality…it’s just my personal sympathy for the human condition. If we knew those innocent people that got killed, it would be a different story. But we don’t. It’s so easy to skate over Iraqi civilian deaths when you have no personal involvement. I want to be very clear that life is life and I do not believe in taking a life regardless of reason. I hope you’d agree.

Let’s look at the idea of America being a melting pot of different cultures. While that over-simplified metaphor will remain to be true on some level, a more accurate depiction would be a pot of chicken soup. Stick with me; each culture adds its own flavor to the mix while still remaining separate—however, all ingredients take on flavors from the other elements in the pot. For instance, a Hispanic family that moves to LA from Mexico will contribute parts of their heritage to their community, but they will also take on aspects of the community in which they live. This process will continue with each following generation. The family is at once, Mexican, but with hints of all the American cultures around them. Korean taco, anyone?

She’s manipulative and clearly very screwed up, bordering on evil, yet there was something about her that made me want to give her a huge hug and tell her that she’s not alone. Same with Jack, although he didn’t know that Susie was his daughter, he knew that he was committing a taboo by dating someone so young, especially given that he was married, which should make him an unlikeable character, yet it doesn’t.

Now do not get me wrong, I am as sadist-loving as the next person when it comes to watching death and destruction on the big screen. A noted Tarantino lover I am indeed. My Grindhouse sensibilities taking no qualms with the warped leanings of many the deranged film. But still, I was hoping for a consciousness behind the sadism here. Perhaps something akin to the aforementioned Golding book. Then perhaps I am the only one that was hoping for a deeper bent on the whole shebang and therefore perhaps I should just enjoy the rah rah rah and go home myself. After all, popcorn movies can be entertaining without any silly social worth - I am not that much of a film snob dammit - and one can certainly become enthralled in a massive effect of fast-paced action that is not necessarily going anywhere but straight forward. Of course even these straight-forward rah rah rah's are tainted by Ross's middle-of-the-road direction and his inability to make us feel any fear or sympathy for the characters, so who knows what could have come to life from a proper, dare I say more daring, adaptation of these books. Perhaps something that would have kept us on the edge of our seats, instead of lying back in them, relaxed and complacent. Perhaps indeed. Then again, this is the kind of movie one calls critic-proof (I say that as if we critical crowd have any say at all anymore, with any type of cinema - not the way we did back in the Pauline Kael hey day of long ago and not so far away) so why the hell am I getting all bent out of shape in the first place. Go see it or don't - what do I care!?

Since the start of the revolt in Syria, the country’s Alawites have been instrumental in maintaining President Bashar al-Assad’s hold on power. A sect of Shia Islam, the Alawites comprise roughly 13 percent of the population and form the bulk of Syria’s key military units, intelligence services, and ultra-loyalist militias, calledshabiha (“ghosts” in Arabic). As the uprising in Syria drags on, there are signs that some Alawites are beginning to move away from the regime. But most continue to fight for Assad — largely out of fear that the Sunni community will seek revenge for past and present atrocities not only against him but also against Alawites as a group. This sense of vulnerability feeding Alawite loyalty is rooted in the sect’s history.

Nowhere in the Muslim world can you find such a profusion of domes and minarets as in Cairo. Rising from the haze of crowded, crumbling streets in the old, chaotic, yet picturesque medieval parts of the city, they dominate the city’s skyline.

The circumstances out of which this poem originated are not known in detail. Albert Barnes, and old Protestant commentator writes: “It is not possible now to ascertain on what occasion this psalm was composed, or who was its author. It has been generally believed that it was written in the later periods of the Jewish history, and after the captivity in Babylon. There is no improbability in the supposition, though there is nothing so marked in the psalm as to make this supposition necessary. It is evident from Ps 115:2-3, that it was composed in a time of national calamity, and especially of such national disaster as might lead the surrounding nations to say of them that they were forsaken by the God whom they worshipped.”

We were thinking of doing a blog post about recent immigration issues we're going to have to deal with, so that James can eventually be here with us permanently (so we don't have to keep going back and forth between countries). It wasn't the greatest of news we got today, we'll have to write about it tomorrow.

1. Do you have kids? If yes, how do you feel about motherhood? If no, do you want to? I do not have kids. I am still in high school, so kids aren't in my future anytime soon. You know, I've never been a "kid" person. I never had the urge to babysit, even when my friends were spending their nights hanging out with other people's children. I never felt the need to hold a baby if I saw one. I cringe at the sound of screaming children in public. Here's the thing, kids don't like me. I was walking around Costco the other day and a little boy came up to me and slapped me. I don't know what it is, but children and I just don't get along. However, whenever I see cute kid clothes, I always picture myself having the cutest little baby. I guess we will just have to see what happens.
The tone of the article is most concerning, though. It is written as if he’s been outed, as if Khan, with razor-sharp wit, has outmanouvered Galloway, linguistically cornering him until he was forced to reveal a deep, dark secret he’d hoped would never come out. Without showing his thoughts on Springs Arabian or Bradfordian, matters of State, politics local or national, it is his religion which seems to be of utmost importance to the reader of The New Statesman.

For example, someone was born with a DP of (-100). To reach a VR of 100, he/she must work really hard to get an effort of 200 (200 – 100 = 100). When he/she finally reaches a VR of 100, he/she still has a saving of 100.
I had some leftover chicken and decided to give these buffalo chicken patties a try. I like the combination of cream cheese and cheddar with the hot sauce. We make our own wing sauce using Franks Red Hot sauce as the base; this will be best using your favorite wing sauce what ever it may be. Maybe they need some bread crumbs mixed in to hold them together better; but the flavor is great as it is and after they cool the cheese firms a little so they really are much easier to handle.

Historically in Australia, the same correlation between stocks and bonds is apparent but less strongly so until the mid part of the last decade. Since then, in a world of highly correlated global markets, the relationship is stronger and so the same question can asked of the Australian market as the US market. Can the divergence persist?
So we spent that Sunday afternoon listening to the magnificent music of Monteverdi performed by a very good orchestra and chorus. My favorite piece “Amor, dicea” came in at about the middle of the concert. Listening to it live was an amazing experience. And it wasn’t just a sonic experience; I could feel the music with my whole body. It was moving, it was touching, it was simply beautiful…

This is supposed to be me with shiny hair but it looks like I took a bath in butter. Which honestly isn't the worst idea ever. In fact, anything is better than reading this post. But unfortunately for you guys, you took a vow to stick this challenge out with me for better or worse. And this, my friends, is the worst.
So, we all turned our attention to Pat and the gorgeous guy, walking to the dance floor. All of a sudden, three other guys appeared at our table. Well, all hope is not lost. We may get to dance, afterall. And these guys weren’t so bad either. The tall, tanned one spoke for his little group.
For Doreen Nelson, standard K-12 education as we know of it today, is a thing of the past. In fact, for her, old ideas in general are a thing of the past. As she ran her own Los Angeles art gallery in the 60′s, she prepared herself to teach architecture classes at UCLA. And while that became a thing of the past for her, a new idea began to form in her head – an idea that would be worthy to be the basis for the sequel to Inception: redesigning the K-12 schooling to be more effective and engaging than it is today. What should one call this idea? Design-based learning.

Crème de Violette is one of those classic cocktail ingredients that until recently, you just couldn't find in Ohio.

I think I have gotten everything done that needed to be done prior to surgery; house cleaned, clothes washed, bought new medical supplies for keeping the bandage changed; groceries and dog food along with bottled water; will pick up prescriptions tomorrow; have had Advance Health Care Directive notarized and have had copies made for each of the designated agents, the hospital, the surgeon, and my Internist; have made arrangements for “dog care”; have made arrangements for getting to and from the hospital; made arrangements for in-home care for 3 weeks. There, everything seems to be in order. All that is left is for me to have the surgery.

Not that blockbusters are necessarily artistically deficient, or that indie films must be artistically worthy, but it’s safe to say that blockbuster movies are crowd pleasers and more readily received. Art-house films are offered only in limited release, and appreciated by a much smaller audience. Their low budget usually means no A-list stars. It also restricts the profuse use of innovative technology as in big budget productions such as Avatar (2009). So their general appeal is the essence of the screenplay, the acting, the storytelling within very limited means.
What I didn’t expect was falling absolutely in love with Iron Man. The movie exceeded all expectations, and no – the martinis had nothing to do with it – but it was Robert Downey, Jr. and the non-stop action. RDJ was back (I’m a big Less Than Zero fan) and I couldn’t have been happier.
The New Haven line has been a popular transportation route almost since the advent of the railroad itself. First laid and operated in 1848, Appleton's was proclaiming a decade later that the shoreline railroad was "the most expeditious way between New York and Boston," linking the Connecticut city with Williams Bridge in the Bronx (pictured at left, from 1865, courtesy NYPL). From there, a connecting track, shared with the Harlem Railroad, took trains directly down to the train depot at 27th Street and Fourth Avenue. When city laws forced the depot up to 42nd Street, that old depot became a storage shed and, later, the first Madison Square Garden.

Again this format was brought forward to the launch and initial test version of the 2012 MP4-27. Only in the last days of Barcelona testing did the revised front end appear. Gone was the snowplough and the straight wing profile. In their place was a simpler nose cone and a pair of vanes dropping vertically from the nose. While the more complex split wing profile was reintroduced. With EBDs less powerful this year, teams are finding downforce levels are lower. We could conclude that the snowplough and straighter wing arrangement were better for downforce, so the new simpler arrangement may be a more efficient way of producing less downforce.
The night was not all high slits and too much cleavage though. Dakota Fanning looked age appropriate and gorgeous in a pale sequined Prada dress for instance. A number of ladies opted for white like Eva Longoria, Claire Danes, Shanina Shaik and Malin Ackerman.

For those that tan, take a HUGE and very LONG look at this woman. Is this what you want to end up looking like? Eventually all that tanning WILL catch up with you. Saggy skin that wrinkles more than the average person’s. Your skin ages drastically and makes you appear MUCH older than you truly are (example; “Shake n’ Bake Mama, above). Sun spots can pop up.

2) When I was 17 I was shopping in Sainsbury’s and my younger brother asked me to pick him up a DVD. I got to the till to pay, and was asked to show some ID. The film was age 12-rated. Despite having my car keys in my hand ready to DRIVE home, along with my student card from my sixth form college with my DOB the cashier would not sell me this 12-rated DVD as I did not have my driving license or passport on me.

Massaging the hair is essential for oily hair. Instead of applying lotions or oils, you can use a toning lotion (which removes dead cells) to massage oily hair with regular brushing. This helps hair growth. A regular massage habit is necessary. Avoid applying oil to the hair as possible.
According to him, Jonathan and his supporters deployed security agencies to tap the phones and monitor the activities of Northern leaders believing to be sponsoring the sect with a view to establishing their link with the Boko Haram. The former minister explained that the narrative was borne out of the experience of the Niger Delta leaders whom he accused of sponsoring militants to disturb oil production as a strategy to pursue the resource control agenda. But he insisted that rather than spending first year in office to identify key formations and operations of the sect with the aim of nipping their activities in the bud, the president and his men were chasing shadows thereby creating enormous opportunities for the sect to grow to the present dangerous level.

I mentioned my frustration in a Facebook post, and got a hoard of comments from friends happily assuring me I needed neither a class nor a teacher to learn baby sign language – there were websites and DVDs galore, they chirped. “Oh, good,” I growled, “because I really need less adult interaction right now.” Yeah, if only I could spend more time with the internet and my television, I’d be loads better. A few friendly, helpful souls missed my sarcasm there and continued to offer suggestions till I had to be mean. “Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears. I come not to learn anything in particular but to get out of the freakin’ apartment and find at least one or two other mothers of infants in this bedroom community of a suburb where I now live. Believe me, I can definitely keep going the hour into DC for everything I would like to do to be social with other moms, but wouldn’t it be nice if I could do something stimulating with other people within, say, 3-10 miles of my own home? I really could have googled baby sign on my own, or ordered videos from Amazon, or had a scintillating chat with a librarian… Best I can tell, the surest way to meet moms out here is to hang around the daycare centers at 5:30 or 6 and wave as they drive their SUVs past. Please forgive my snarkiness. I am looking for interesting activities with other people. Not another thing to do alone at home.”
Far too often nowadays, a “bottle-conditioned” label from a British micro-brewery results in a bottle of flat, cloudy liquid that somehow aspires to be like a pub pint of “real ale”, but ends up like the kind of pint you immediately return to the bar.

On the contrary, they testify that immediately after this supper, He went with His apostles upon the Mount of Olives, where He gave up His Spirit to sadness, and was in anguish while His apostles slept, at a short distance. They contradict each other upon the day on which they say the Lord’s Supper took place; because on one side, they note that it took place Easter-eve, that is, the evening of the first day of Azymes, or of the feast of unleavened bread; as it is noted (1) in Exodus, (2) in Leviticus, and (3) in Numbers; and, on the other hand, they say that He was crucified the day following the Lord’s Supper, about midday after the Jews had His trial during the whole night and morning.

Anyway, the question became, amongst Molly’s friends, “What is the best way to honor a wonderful friend’s birthday?” She doesn’t like fanfare. She doesn’t like attention.

That’s Jen and I way in the back (our server, Malissa, who’s one of the owners, took the photo), and another patron sitting at the counter (we got there late, after the dinner crowd, which is why it’s so empty). The first thing I noticed when we walked in is that place would have been really uncomfortable for me when I was at my heaviest. I probably wouldn’t have fit at the counter (those chairs are bolted to the floor), and while the little tables on the right had stools, there just wasn’t a lot of room. But none of that is an issue now!

Eros was hot. I loved the arrogant, bad-boy vibe he exuded right from the beginning and enjoyed seeing the softer side underneath when he falls for Psyche. Psyche was a strong and spunky protagonist who was beautiful inside and out, while also having the fatal flaw of making a few rash, bad, bad, BAD decisions. I enjoyed the snippets of the other Olympians who made guest appearances throughout the book and my only complaint is that a certain major god who played an important role in Psyche’s past didn’t grace the page. Other than that, DESTINED was a fun, entertaining, and enlightening tromp through Greek mythology that I highly recommend.

However, pleasantries aside, I must profess I take offense at your characterization of me and my particular subspecies. You discuss me as if I were some aberrant form of the “true” Tyrannosaurus Rex (I believe your meticulously massaged words were “miniature prototype,” but we all know that’s just code for “poor little bugger”). Perhaps I am being overly-sensitive, but I couldn’t help but feel that I was being characterized as a diminutive (read: primitive) ancestor of the real deal, a mere evolutionary stepping stone, an embarrassing cousin clipped from the family album who – what was it? – “really throws a wrench into this observed pattern.”

Jerry Unser Sr. inherited his father’s knack for mechanics and opened up a garage in Albuquerque because it was on Route 66, where he knew he could make money. His kids, his brother’s kids, they were all into racing. at a young age. When they qualified for a race, they competed against each other, or each others records more than the other racers in the game. Jerry Sr. was constantly putting race cars together from parts he’d acquire. He’d modify and customize them for speed and endurance. When the Indianapolis 500 speedway opened up, big money began funding development of the expensive race cars that are on the track today.

I’m a conceptual dude. I hate concision, I hate the 140 characters limit on those social network tools, I hate rushing because ‘there’s just no time!’ In my opinion, this is not about the digital age. It’s about the modern humans and their society. We’re in a world of ‘right here, right now’. Nobody wants to wait for anything, everybody wants immediateness, at the restaurant, in bed and in every life activity. So for them, listening to a whole album is too big a commitment. One track is good enough, because they can easily think they know it all. Once again, it’s all about the classification. ‘I heard that track from that artist so I know he’s doing this and that and that’s it. Next!’ It’s easy, the good people are dressed in white, the bad people are wearing black and the world is a magnificent dichotomic establishment. But I’m a fool. I’m a dreamer. If someone gives me 15 tracks to listen to, unified under a concept, showing some sort of evolution, I will travel through them and appreciate the effort. I know my music will never be in the top 100 because I’m not trying to reach the rushing population of our world. Each track is not the same than the previous one, I have a different voice for every person living in my head – and they are plentiful! I’m appealing to the other fools and the other dreamers who know it doesn’t have to be that way. Good things take time, and a good album takes time to be created, one with various secrets to unfold after many plays, keys and sounds to be heard only after one got really intimate with it. And this takes a certain amount of time people can’t afford to spend because there’s work and tv series and birthday parties and cat videos and celebrities interviews and football games and so on…

We do not know exactly what the “handicap” is that Paul talks about – most recently researchers have stated that it was probably his physical “disability” due to the struggle, hard travel, beatings, floggings etc. that were part of his everyday living. But we do know that he pleaded with God to remove it three times…and that, every one of those three times, God said “no”. Paul, a bastion for what faith is, did not receive what he was praying for. But then again, neither did Jesus – think back on the Garden of Olives…

My goal was to complete my last research paper for graduate school by bedtime yesterday; I finished six of eight pages, but I decided I’d be better off finishing it minus the nausea, pain, and throbbing which overwhelmed me. I went to bed last night after taking what little medication I’m allowed to take while pregnant and hoped–rather, prayed–for the best. Okay, let’s be honest–I BEGGED for relief!

Beautiful- at the risk of sounding a bit Oz Clarke, the Caledonian Auld Aquaintance brought out the oats and went perfectly with the turnip. Dark but light, I came over all och aye.

TINERAL: an animal widespread as a pet on Riya prior to the epidemic. They are born kitten-sized, but continue to grow throughout their life spans. Wonderful singers, with an instinctive sense of harmony and voices that resemble our instruments. They are feathered and resemble a winged monkey physically.

My biggest obstacle, beyond editing was probably believing in myself. I had to realize that I wasn't meant to be another writer, I met to write with the imagination and heart God gave me. It's unique to the person I am. Others might have ideas on how I should write, but I still have to be true to who I am.
Mrs May said she was ready to consider introducing “risk-based” controls as part of a long-term solution to delays at airports, despite having forced Brodie Clark, the former head of the UK Border Force, out of his job in November after she claimed he had relaxed immigration checks without her authorisation.

For a bear, there is no substantive difference - that sacred, fêted difference - between a corporate supermarket and a locally owned grocery store. There are places with doors unsubstantially secured and there are places with things to eat, and from time to time, those places are one and the same.
In other random news, we, we being my mom, sis, and a friend, went to the Anti-Colonial Thanksgiving dinner a few nights ago, where we ate delicious vegan food made by a local collective, watched a very interesting, moving, and thought-provoking documentary film called Club Native, listened to a couple of interesting speakers (notably a woman from BC who had some very interesting things to say about the Olympics, organizing against the Olympics, and similar things), and just left with lots to think about. And talk about! From the moment we left, we were having fascinating conversations on Indigenous rights, colonialism, sexism, minority groups, counter cultures... I love the wonderful conversations mum, Emi, and I have! Emi also commented how very much she likes being around the more radical type counter cultures, including both unschoolers and anarchists (the type of people to attend an anti-colonial dinner are not exactly State loving types)... I agree that it just tends to be so much more of an open and friendly environment!
Sunday’s break in that pattern likely reflected a sense of anger and impotence among protesters upset that Putin was handily elected to a new term in the Kremlin despite their defiance.

Again feeling the need to get away from the underdog fighting movies, I feel that the movie I’ve chosen for today could not be further removed from them. When the Lady MacBalls last suggested a movie, it was my most popular review in a while, so I felt a little obligated to do her next request quickly. The movie she suggested was a movie I already owned, but had never opened and never really had an inspiration to open it. I had seen it before, though the last time was much closer to when the movie came out. It doesn’t seem like the kind of movie I would enjoy, but I vaguely remember it being better than one would expect based on the subject matter. Let’s see if memory serves in my review of Clueless, written and directed by Amy Heckerling, and starring Alicia Silverstone, Stacey Dash, Brittany Murphy, Paul Rudd, Donald Faison, Breckin Meyer, Dan Hedaya, Jeremy Sisto, Justin Walker, Wallace Shawn, Twink Caplan, Elisa Donovan, and Julie Brown.

I find babies cute, sure, who doesn't? but they never hit me like that. Plus I was told I'm not allowed to say maternal. I'm paternal. It just feels more maternal than paternal. Whatever, damn semantics.
When I talk about academic matters, I like the freedom to think aloud rather than having to ensure that every sentence is duly footnoted. Obviously that's the case with strictly academic blogging too, but the job market is so cut-throat that I wouldn't be entirely comfortable with putting too much out there. On the other hand, there's a massive queue to get into the journals on which continued employment relies, and posting work-in-progress is one way to contact readers and engage in academic debate.

The proportion of babies born prematurely in this period remained very constant (between 6.8% and 7.9%). The post-smoking ban years were unremarkable, with percentages of 7.3, 7.4, 7.6 and 7.2 (2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively). The lowest rate was in 1996. There appears to be no relationship with the general smoking rate, maternal smoking rate or the smoking ban.

In 381 AD, church leaders met again and revised the Nicene Creed at the Council of Constantinople. The creed we know today as the Nicene Creed is the 381 version. This creed is the most unifying and ecumenical of all the Christian creeds. The Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and most Protestant Churches hold up the Nicene Creed as an orthodox statement of Christian belief.
Credit to the barman, though. I had asked for a third of the Habanero Sculpin but the barman insisted that I dry a drop of it first before to see if I really wanted more of it. I'm glad that he did because one taste was enough of this toxic brew for me to realise the error of my ways. I doubt if I would have lasted the third of a pint.
Father, take my blunder and make it wise. Open the hearts and minds of the children to see Jesus as Real. Your name being honored is all that matters. Heal the hurts. Crush the lies. Bring us into unity with You. Protect the children and the truths stored in them. Give me wisdom to face the attacks. May everyone involved see Your glory. Amen

It was midnight. I was exhausted and needed a couple hours of sleep. We’d gone into Pearl Harbor and picked up Commodore Kenny and his inspection team. The ship was doing well, but I felt I needed to be too many places at once. For this, the overnight supervisors would have to drive Santa Fe into position: accounting for the movements of the enemy, the interfering maritime traffic, the wind and sea conditions, and a number of other factors.
First and foremost is the confirmation of what I feared had been true. I somehow, someway, picked up the idea that I had to look like that, or I was doing something wrong. My favorite fitness website, “nerdfitness,” always says that appearance is the consequence of fitness. So if I am fit, why don’t I look like that?
One amazing moment came when I borrowed a motorcycle and got on the Interstate 10 Freeway knowing that it would lead me to the Pacific Ocean.

I researched this and prayed about this for close to a month. I asked for two signs from God, very specific signs from God that he would reveal to me if it was the truth or not. The first sign I asked for was that if it was true God would keep it from raining on Saturday. There was a big storm supposed to come through that day. God held back the storm. He stalled it until shortly after midnight. It did not rain that day but the rain came on Sunday instead. Then I asked for another sign a week or so in advance. I had no clue what the forecast was saying. I asked that God would make it rain at least two days that week. It rained Thursday, Friday and Saturday, then on Sunday the sun came up and everything dried out. It was amazing to see this considering that I asked for rain at least two days and it rained two and a half days until about sunset on Saturday around the time Jesus Christ arose from the dead.

“To give unselfishly, to love the least of these, Jesus I'm learning how to live with open hands. All these treasures that I own will never satisfy my soul, Jesus I lay them at your throne with open hands. I lift my hands open wide let the whole world see how you love, how you died, how you set me free. free at last, I surrender all I am with open hands, with open hands. To finally let go of my plans, these earthly kingdoms built of sand. Jesus at your cross I stand with open hands. You took the nails, You bore the crown, You hung your head, Your love poured out. You took my place, You paid the price so Jesus now I will give my life…” --Matt Papa, Open Hands
A little while ago Victoria Usova contacted me to ask if I fancied doing an illustration swap, which I hardly ever do.. but this time, I felt something warm and familiar in her illustrations, and so after much trouble choosing, decided that I would like this Foxy Fox watercolour original on the left to come and live with me, in return for my Button Mouse travelling over the sea to New York. Victoria is a Ukraine-born New Yorker and said of my work that "your painted world seems close to mine, but more in the evening or nighttime. Perhaps we travel to similar locations just during different times of the day." I liked that.

His biggest accomplishment to date came last night when he climbed the stairs for the very first time. It would have been easier for me to wait a little longer before showing him some ways to climb the steps but he was definitely showing an interest so we gave it a try. The look on his face when he got to the top made it worth it. He couldn't believe he did it! And this from a child who just a month ago was barely walking on his own or even crawling. The more he accomplishes, the more I see him trying to work out some of his gross motor and problem solving skills on his own, with less and less frustration each time.

Using a spatula push the edges of the frittata towards the center as it is cooking, allowing the egg mixture to seep down through the vegetables. When the frittata seems to be well set on the bottom, get a plate, the same size as the pan. Lay the plate on top of the frittata and quickly flip the frittata onto the plate. Gently slide the frittata back into the pan and allow it to cook until the egg is set on the bottom side, for another minute or two. Slide the frittata out of the pan and on to a serving plate. Allow the frittata to cool to room temerature before cutting into small serving sizes.
These were the realizations I had as I slowly recovered in bed. In the past few days I have become more productive. My goal is to work tirelessly until I see some real results in Bonga. I’ve realized that in my natural state, I feed off of stress and responsibility. Give me a ton of work and I thrive. With little pressure and my own excuses I perish.
It wasn’t that my parents hated their kids and wanted to pump (and plump) us up with preservatives and other bad things - they simply didn’t know any better, had their own personal issues with food, and weren’t really interested in food the way I am - to learn more about just what it was we were putting into our bodies.
I cannot fathom the details that God has promised await us when we return to His arms but I can earnestly say that knowing my Piper will be there and will immediately say "C'mon! C'mon mommy!" does nothing but bring me hope. Hope for tomorrow.

Off for bagels, fruit, and water. I grab a cart, wipe the handle, wheel through the sliding doors, and immediately hear, “Knock, knock, knockin’ on Heaven’s door, hey hey heyheyhey…” I chuckle. I love the humor and joy that abounds in the messages of the Universe. And the next song was even more poignant, an oldie but goodie, one that I had never heard before. The gist of it was basically ‘Have a little bit of faith in me. That’s all you need to do. I am here, with open arms, waiting to love you whenever you need, girl. Just have a little bit of faith in me.’ Wow.

This is your time to shine. I will take any and all suggestions. You want to suggest a comic about sharks that do martial arts and combat an army of sea bass? Cool, I’m with that. You want to suggest a comic of teens dealing with middle school drama and vampires? Alright, I could give it a shot. You feel like suggesting a black and white comic with no dialogue about flowers that are actually ultra powerful demigods in Norse mythology? I guess I’m good with that too.

One thing I did like about the story was its structure. Too often, stories told with a nonlinear narrative sacrifice comprehension for style, yet Taylor’s use of the device enhances Jake’s story. The unique chapter headings she gives to approximate time are creative and easily place readers within the timeline of the story. Unfortunately, these, too, become somewhat redundant when the story switches focus to Sam, and so lose most of their impact.

I find that’s hard to answer. The term “solar storm” has crept into our usage, but nobody has defined what it means. Whether a “solar storm” is happening on the sun or is referring to the effect on the Earth depends on who’s talking.
They genuinely believe that ‘British soldiers will burn in hell’. There is very little to discuss or debate here. They will not change. There are many taqiyya-merchants, however, the ‘moderates’, such as the Muslim Council of Britain and MPACUK, who believe exactly the same things as MAC. But they know that the youthful honesty and naiveté displayed by MAC will be counterproductive to the cause of Islam. Thus they say: We are against terrorism, but… We condemn X but… They know that outright support for terrorists and killers like Hamas will seriously backfire. Thus they indulge in the ancient Islamic art of taqiyya – lies, dissimulation, simulation, pretence, obfuscation, etc. They are good at it. Muslims have been practising the Art of Taqiyya since Mohammed himself gave his own exemplary lessons in it.

Overall, I feel as though Morgan Spurlock didn’t quite have an objective for Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan’s Hope. With the way it was written, it can feel at times more like a commercial or tourism piece than a documentary about the actual convention. It’s not as though Spurlock didn’t deliver on his promise. The advertised synopsis is in no way misleading, and when it comes to this film, what you see is what you get. It’s just that you would think that with someone as high profile as Stan Lee producing, Spurlock could have easily exceeded expectations.
In addition to your client and its employees, there may be other decision making stakeholders and advisors, such as CPAs or attorneys. These other advisors are typically ‘gatekeepers’ for your clients and may have an important role to play in designing and implementing benefits. Sometimes these advisors are the last hurdle between selling a plan design and getting the client to put the plan in place. By making room for these advisors in the planning process, you can convert your clients’ other advisors into your biggest allies. Not only will they help you get the case implemented, they may even refer new clients to you in the future.

George Takei came on with his two moderators to help guide the show. This proved to be an unfortunate choice. Takei was wonderful and awesome. He played Lt Sulu on the original Star Trek tv series and is becoming well known as an openly gay man who is advocating for equal rights. He’s Japanese American and remembers going through the injustice of the concentration camps that were formed during WWII here in America. The reason this was unfortunate was that his moderator was a local radio host who happened to keep stealing the show. It was rather frustrating to have him keep speaking over Takei’s anecdotes and interrupting audience interactions. It was the only poor moderator I encountered in my panels, and I would have really liked to have heard some of the stories that Takei started but didn’t finish.
So Jack decides that you have to take control, make decisions, even if those decisions are tiny and seem unimportant. He knows that everything makes a difference: going down this street and not that one, or leaving the house five minutes later, or smiling at that person, or not, or eating in this restaurant and not that one. And Jack’s method of attracting luck to himself is to allow the coin to decide small actions**. He thinks that if he can throw himself on the coin’s mercy, like a sacrifice, luck will follow him.

Sometimes I swear he’s sound asleep while it’s done. I was particularly amused when he was sporting the radishes on his head. I about fell off my chair laughing because he didn’t even move! I think they’re hilarious, but then again, I adore cats, so just about any cat makes me happy.

The race has road and lots of it; asphalt, asphalt covered with gravel and hard packed fire road. We started with 6-miles of asphalt. Lovers of single track won't enjoy this race as much, I on the other hand was okay with it, it made the single track sections much more precious and I was able to make up time that was lost on the big climbs. There were a number of good climbs, miles 6 to 14 was the biggest of them all and I'm glad we got that out of the way early, the big climbs were also followed by long downhills which I found quite hard on the quads especially if they were on road. The downhill from 15 to 30 was just such a downhill. It started with a steep single track downhill that gave way to a long section of road. Before we arrived at the 31 mile aid station of Seattle Bar/Applegate River, we crossed back briefly to California. It was here that Evan Hone caught up to me. He had gotten lost with several runners early in the race. He looked relaxed and upbeat, had an "it is what it is" attitude about the whole thing. I wished him luck which was all I could do since he was quickly on his way. I thought for the most part that the course was well marked. In the case of Evan and the several runners who got lost with him, there was supposed to be course monitors at the crucial intersection who were not in position when they came through. There was also some confusion on the marking ribbons. At the briefing we were specifically told the type of ribbons to look for because there was another event being run in the same area. We were told to look for pink and black striped ribbons and fluorescent green ones, anything else we should ignore. Well we also found orange ribbons which were also meant for our race. I knew this to be true because the orange ribbons would be the only markers on the course and just when I would be convinced I was following a different event's course I would run into a pink and black striped ribbon or a green one. If it was true that there were two separate events sharing the same trail the pink and black striped and green ribbons would have come in shorter intervals, like every quarter mile as they indicated.

Publishers must collect the full value of the premium plus an additional penny to qualify the subscription or single copy as paid circulation.
“Drinking to your good health, happiness and long life, maybe?” added Bernie.
A good agent knows the publishing world and what can and can't be done in it. Your agent may handle foreign rights for you, or have an arrangement with another agency that will do this. Your agent will check your contracts and argue about anything that should be argued about. Your agent will invoice your publishers, and chase the publisher's accounts department when they don't pay the invoice. Your agent should promote you as and when appropriate, give editorial guidance on your work, and have an overview of your career and how to manage it. An agent will rarely be interested in representing someone they consider a one-book wonder, unless that book is truly wonderful and likely to make a lot of money.

But you ask what about this POD thing? Amazon uses it and Barnes and Noble uses it. I mean isn't that like "against the rules?" Well, got news for you. Any of the "Big 6" who says today they are not moving in the direction of POD is outright lying. POD allows them to cut drastically on costs of inventory. It allows them to produce on demand. It allows them to know exactly just what is going on and it allows them to give out serious inventory and publishing and royalty statistics. In other words, it saves them money. Big money.

These days already blur together. I know we shopped, went to the ALERT Leprosy Hospital, and told the boys at Kolfe goodbye. I also know that on Thursday night, I was awake until midnight or 1:00AM. I was anxious to get back home to my normal routine, but was so so sad to leave Ethiopia. I went out on the balcony at the guest house and just sat. Breathing the air, watching the activity on the streets. I have never been sadder to leave than I was on this trip.

Émilie ’s second affair, and a friendship that would last until her death, was with Voltaire. She may have met him when she was young, but her adult friendship began with him in 1733 after the birth of her third child. Even though intellectual women were the butt of many jokes during that time not only in society, but also in literature and the theater (“femme savant” was not a compliment), intellectual men often still sought out these women as their companions. Émilie and Voltaire were companions in every sense. Over the next 15 – 16 years before Émilie ’s death in 1749, they would rarely be separated and would challenge each other to produce work that has stood the test of time.

The bipartisan leadership in Congress is committed to working on new legislation that will prevent default while substantially reducing Washington spending.” — Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell“Congress should refrain from playing reckless political games with our economy. Instead, it should be responsible and do its job, avoiding default and cutting the deficit.” — White House Press Secretary Jay Carney

Post summer and the European world bounces back. The financial gurus pick up the pace and school bags are packed with pencils sharpened. Moving, building or renovating is within reach before Christmas and the cosmetic industry promises improved miracles to combat the after effects of too much fun in the sun. The gorgeous and glamorous re-pound the pavements and the boutiques are fresh with winter merchandise and full price tags. It is time to harness my thoughts. I must try and write more, find pretty blog titbits for you to enjoy, think about the olives and the forthcoming harvest. I must forget the hazy days of summer and get back to business.

Thus we read of Naaman, the captain of the king of Syria, that through this one man God gave the whole land good fortune and success. So through the holy Joseph He gave great good fortune to the whole kingdom of Egypt, and in 2 Kings 3:14, Elisha says to Jehoram, “I would not look to thee, if Jehoshaphat, King of Judah, were not there,” and thus the godless kings of Israel and Edom had to be helped for the sake of one godly man, when otherwise they would have been ruined in all kinds of distress; and in the book of Judges one can see the good that God did through Ehud, Gideon, Deborah, Samson, and other individuals, though the people were not worthy of it. See, on the other hand, what great harm Doeg did at the court of King Saul ( 1 Kings 22:1) and what Absalom accomplished against his father David, with the aid and counsel of Ahithophel ( 2 Kings 15:1).
So we should make something like historical...or patriotic, or something.
It appeared to me that Datuk Ambiga was gesturing to us to disperse but I couldn't be sure as we all could not hear anything.(Note: from news report, she had earlier made her speech at the Masjid Jamek Station telling everyone that the objective had been achieved and everyone should go home). Shouts of "Buka!" "Duduk!" became even stronger as at the point no one knew what was going on.
This elderly figure of farce has been a catastrophe for decent Patriotic folk in the East Midlands. Harmless as he may seem shuffling around the EU's pretend parliament as if he has some relevance other than as a makeweight errand boy for Farage, worth £76,000 a year to him on the 4000 budget!

God is also at work in the other Biblical “ghostly” appearance. At the Transfiguration, Moses and Elijah appear with Jesus. Again, far from being an indication of what we think of when we talk about ghostly hauntings, the text makes it obvious that this is something exceptional.

This is everywhere and it really shouldn’t surprise anyone if we keep finding it in other aspects of human behaviour. Where does religion come from? No clue. Is it objectively good for anything? Not sure. Is it an actual source of evil? No. How could I possibly believe that? I’m an atheist. I don’t believe in any external sources of evil. Evil is in us by process of elimination. It is a necessary consequence of my atheism that I believe all religions were wholly invented by regular people. They’ve survived because they were useful to people, and sometimes what they’ve been useful for is letting people pass the buck.

(FYI… I am a born-again Christian, from a Pentecostal background. I understand the Divine as God the Father, and I believe in the Trinity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. However, I’ve sensitive to need for gender-neutral terminology for the Divine. Also, I know the Divine is known by many names. I feel comfortable with my understanding (I can hold my own), while keeping the door open for others to be able to share their understanding of the Divine. – There’s no right or wrong way when it comes to one’s personal understanding of the Divine.)

If you’re not in-the-know, the Liebster Award is given to blogs with fewer than 200 followers to help spread the word about them and get more followers. I actually have never checked my subscribers stats, relying on my “visits” stats from WordPress. The most I’ve had in one day is, funnily enough, 199. Checking my subscribers stats, it looks like I have 13 via Google Reader (not including myself*) and 33 through WordPress. A more Type-A person would be disappointed, but notoriety is a little scary to me!
My wife’s sister surprised us with many six packs of New Belgium Fat Tire, Blue Paddle, and 3° Below. Also she had 3 very large bottles of Chimay, one each of Chimay Rouge, Chimay Blue, and Chimay Blanche. Having these Trappist monk brewed beers in the house gave me one more thing to be thankful for.

I Love cupcakes, so when I saw this cute little book at the library called Cupcake by Charise Mericle Harper, I had to take a peek. I have to say it is such a cute little book. It's about this plain ol' Vanilla cupcake with fancy brother and sister cupcakes (Rainbow-Sprinkles, Chocolaty Chocolate, Pink Princess, Polka Dot, etc.). But when they all get picked and he doesn't, he feels lonely. Along comes Candle.

Things randomly happening in crass, haphazard succession. Repeat until fade. More of the same, exactly the same, as the first part but only occurring in a slightly shuffled sequence. It’s a money maker. A quality-proof hit-creating concept s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d out into a tediously bilious infinity. I’m now fully done with Bradley Cooper & pals’ tiresome escapades after two joyless jaunts. It’s the kind of film which proudly bellows that it doesn’t care about what it promotes or says because it truly believes that it belongs in a state of post-ironic universal acceptance of all things, however questionable. (Men can do what they want anytime, all the time; transsexuals are to be laughed at anytime, all the time, and so on.) That’s just the beginning of what’s so wrong about these godawful films. And another thing: it simply wasn't funny.

He was also opposed to the Societies’ radical platform and violent resistance.

As you arrive at the Contemporary Resort and make your way up to the 2nd floor, you are warmly greeted by the hostess. Hopefully you’ve made your Advance Dining Reservations, as it can become a challenge to secure a spot at the California Grill, especially during ‘peak’ times of year, and even peak hours…but more on that in a bit.

Even in the few years that they had been together, Niikam had seen his partner save others from misfortune. Gangs also roamed the desolate lands outside of the cities and those on the outskirts were ignored by authorities. It was gang rule and that was one thing Jesphan did not stand by. He might be a mysterious stranger that took what he needed and lived without any connections to the city, but he did not believe in taking people’s lives or dignity. He had watched on one such occasion, late at night, when a gang had happened upon a lone farmhouse where a mother and daughter waited vigil for the father. Instead, these gruesome men happened upon the house, malice and savage thoughts clear in their eyes. Jesphan had waited patiently in the shadows until the group had descended upon the house. Niikam, out of fear, had sidled back deep behind a dead tree and when he had turned to see if anything had happened, his companion was gone. There was a short flash of light and a low, bang, almost like thunder, that rattled the window panes. Then, Jesphan had stepped out and walked past into the plains with no acknowledgement to the mother and daughter or to Niikam. He had thought about asking Jesphan in regards to what had happened, but thought better of it. Something about his partner’s stoic expression bent him to silence.
It is amazing to look at that same landscape that was scarred by wreckage and debris and see it smooth again. The Japanese have been working hard to fix the physical damage, but the country has a long way to go before it looks the same. Homes are still being rebuilt, thousands of people are still finding new places to settle in. The nuclear plants are still being dealt with to eliminate the threat they pose. And despite a brave face, psychological damage due to trauma is still a very real concern for many Japanese people, especially the children who faced the event at such a young age.

And now, for my concert review! Last night I saw Mutemath here in Jacksonville. They were amazing. They could have sold out a much larger venue, but they chose to introduce the new album Odd Soul in small clubs. And let me say, the fans really lucked out with that decision. They rocked to a crowd of under 200 the same way they would have in an arena. The soulful base riffs and percussion with New Orleans flair sound even better live, and Paul Meany has the voice of an angel, if an angel sang for an alt-rock band from Louisiana. The high points for me were Spotlight and Typical, but the new stuff also sounded great.
Keeping the pantry pristine has become more of a challenge as the kids have grown up -they seem to be constantly in there rummaging, snacking and not putting things back in the right spot or cleaning up messes! It was way overdue for a good clearing out which is why last week, armed with a glass of wine and The Anderson Cooper Show for company I went for it: I removed every last item, took inventory, re-organized and washed everything down. After a Costco run, the pantry is now back to being an efficient and well stocked space -and my stress level, down a few notches. Beautiful.

Intellectual women have increased greatly in number since the Bluestocking days. Some 55% of new entrants to university are women and outnumber men at every level up to PhD. But from my own experiences I see how the struggle for the right to be clever, sexy and feminine goes on. The original 'Bluestockings' were our foremothers, the missing link in an unbroken chain of female creativity. Their work should never be forgotten.

Uppinder’s high-minded think-chat is leaking into my inner peace. I can hear TRACI whispering to me various ways I might break his jaw or kill him with a couple nasty moves. I’m betting Uppinder’s TRACI is doing the same thing with me. I get the sense, maybe, that this means something. Something smart and deep, like Uppinder’s rambling. Got no way to get the a-ffirm on that action, though. I got no specs on how to operate on high-mind course. I tongue up some tunes in my earpiece. It’s Parsec.

Ahhh, but along comes McDonalds, Burger King, Wal-Mart, and CVS. In the name of modern marketing and branding, every fast food chain or retail store looks almost exactly the same – whether it’s located in New York or New Orleans….England or New England. Today our communities are a hodgepodge of mind boggling architectural rubbish designed with only one thing in mind – to grab your attention as you drive by at 55 miles per hour. In fact, the world today is not designed for human beings. New communities are designed for cars and trucks. So if Winston Churchill was right – that “our buildings shape us”…. then sadly it seems we’ve turned the average American citizen into an overweight, unmemorable, in-distinctive, unremarkable globule concerned only with selfish and immediate gratification.

I’m becoming more and more comfortable with the cows, although I do still have a healthy consciousness of their size. I love watching them, and look forward to my animal chore days. I am constantly challenged not to anthropomorphize, … but now that the calves are here, it’s interesting to see how they interact with their mothers, and how their mothers interact with them… how they don’t always come when their mothers call them, and the farm echoes with the calls of aggravated (or worried) mother cows.

If you have never been beaten by your husband, all we can say is; be warned as this is a clear sign that he does not love you at all. You should indeed do the rightful thing expected from a loving wife; scream, beg him to stop, and of course thank him for beating you by warming his bath water and making him a nice hot ugali or sour porridge.

You need a day to forget the alarm clock. Not worry about the lawn or the laundry. Forget about the bills, and work, and all the little stresses in your lives. Just prop your feet up, recline and close your eyes. If you don't have a recliner, don't even bother getting out of bed. Not even the TV should be playing on Sleep Day, folks. This isn't an opportunity for you to catch up on all the episodes of "Sex and the City" you missed. This day is about sleep.

It's always wonderful to not only discover something new when looking through old comics, but actually get conformation from someone who was there. I've been lucky to meet some of the creators of the early Marvel period in person and occasionally go over their work. As a student of comic art I examine covers and interiors and find alterations by other artists, or uncredited pencils and inks from time to time. Some changes are pretty clear cut, others puzzling. Not every artist is aware of corrections, or is unable to identify uncredited inkers. Drawing so many pages, they sometimes have a hard time identifying their own work if it was inked by a strong hand, or perhaps rushed out. I've discovered that it never hurts to ask a question, and this weekend proved the point.
I have been having a lot of discussions and read many many articles over recent weeks and months about children's ministry and the importance of thinking about the whole family rather than just the kids.
I’ve been meaning to post again in order to keep everything up-to-date and the wonderful discussions fresh in my mind, unfortunately illness has kept me from posting as I would have liked. I’m feeling better now, so I thought I’d look over my notes and do a quick update on what we’ve done, what we’re struggling with, and what seems to be working.
The day before this insane and crazy time-table came to an end, I was literally running/fast walking on the treadmill and crying out "I WANT TO GO HOME!!!!"

We had been at The Capital Grille just before the holidays for an event, which left us with two learnings: (1) we needed to go back for steak asap (their steak sliders were almost life-changing) (2) events like the one we went to were good for takeaway gifts - we paid $10 and each got a $50 gift card to The Capital Grille! The dining room was wonderfully old school steakhouse - dark woods, dark booths, white linens...

I carried him into the vet’s office and they rushed us into the back. The vet examined him and confirmed for us what had become obvious. Stafford was at the end. I spent some time with him, rubbing his head and behind his ears. Telling him it was ok. He’d been a good boy. At first, his head was laying on the metal gurney and I knew he was uncomfortable. Schpup liked his softness so I asked them to give me a blanket for under his head. His front paws were wet with vomit and pee. In the fog of those moments, I was worried it was bothering him because he generally didn't like to be wet. But he was so ill, he couldn't lick his paws dry. There was a roll of paper towels nearby. I grabbed several to try to dry off his legs and paws for him. It's funny the things you think about in the lonely back room of your vet's office.
Sharing Ruppert Stadium, The Newark Eagles ball club, played in the (second) Negro National League during the years 1936 through 1948. This team fielded equally, if not potentially more legendary players than their Stadium-mates (the Bears) did. Names like Monte Irvin, Ray Dandridge, Don Newcombe, and Lary Doby, to name just a few, graced the fields of Newark along with the Bears' notables providing the city of Newark, most likely unbeknown-st to them at the time, a legendary assemblage of Baseball figures.

Everybody from the youngest to the eldest, the smallest to the thickest has their move. You can look around the room at any point in the class and see that moment happening.

Marvin Freeman was acquired as a free agent from the Braves following the 1993 season. Freeman was a reliever in Atlanta, but was successfully converted to a starter in Colorado. In his 3 seasons with the Rockies, Freeman had a record of 20-18 with a 4.91 ERA and 199 strikeouts. In late 1996, Freeman was waived by the Rockies and ended up with the White Sox for the remainder of the season.
I like to decorate my cookies by first piping an outline with stiff icing, then filling it in with runny icing of the same color. Once that dries for a few hours, then I like to pipe another border on top, and then pipe on any extra decorations (in this case, the yellow centers and the white accents).

Long story short: bad idea. Disaster relief, especially after an earthquake like the one that hit Haiti, takes years, not just months. Long-term development projects for rebuilding livelihoods, schools, and public services are essential. Saundra at “Good Intentions Are Not Enough” again covers this eloquently and succinctly. She notes that after the tsunami hit Indonesia, tons of well meaning people built and funded orphanages. Unfortunately, because the rest of the community didn’t get the same services and benefits, families started sending their kids to the orphanages. Donors then see this influx of “orphans” and the cycle repeats itself.
4. Pray that God would prepare us emotionally, physically and mentally to be a parent to this child when they get to our home. Pray that we would have endurance to get through difficulties with attachment and bonding.
This is something I have been thinking about lately, after meeting another adoptive mom at the park. During our conversation she said, "I didn't want another newborn because I had done that and didn't want to take a baby away from a couple that had no child yet." Well, of course, we have been blessed with 3 newborns but I'm not sure I feel like I "took" them away from another couple. Those 3 birth mom's had plenty of parents to choose from, and for some reason, they chose our family to place their precious baby in(I mean, come one, what were they thinking? ;) ).

So after reading and praying, I decided to not call myself a Christian. People who don’t believe in God relate the word “christian” with bible-thumping, stone throwing people. I did not want to be considered as one of those people.

‘We matched two of the saltier-colored furs and laid them side by side,’ she writes. ‘With a gold-handled blade, Dimitris sliced off their pale inner edges and sewed the skins together, creating a mutant, two-headed fox pelt with a double-wide back. “See?” he said. “Like plastic surgery.” Then he unceremoniously swiped across the tops of their necks. Like that, my foxes were fabric.’

Share a story about someone you admire. It’s Mother’s Day. I admired my mother, although I never told her that. She would have been embarrassed and shrugged it off because conceit to her was a deadly sin. Funny how the people who have every reason to be proud, generally aren’t, really. Mother’s are a strange bunch. Even when they’re doing a crappy job, they mean well. Hug your mother today.
Between 1977-08, employment grew 100% in right-to-work states vs. the national average of 71% and 56.5% in non-right-to-work states. That's according to a January study that Ohio University economics professor Richard Vedder did for the Indiana Chamber of Commerce.

The book seems to be more BDSM erotica, but it only really works on that level with the one Master named Zane, but he's made out to be the bad guy in the story because he's too rough on the subs. I didn't think he was rough and I liked his scene with Wynne. Dierk and Rolf (can I tell you how much I hate these names!) are brothers who fall for Wynne, but Dierk can't have her because he's forced to be with another female, and Rolf isn't who Wynne wants. She wants Dierk.
Walk around the track at my house for 4 to 5 rounds around the park and then jog a few more rounds.

72) I'm not a big drinker. I do not like to get drunk, and will stop drinking long before that point. I like wine, especially mead, and Midori Sours, 7 and 7's, and that's about it. I like having Bloody Marys at home, but I don't order them when we go out, as very few places have good Bloody Marys. The Spouse Sparrow and I went all through Vegas without finding one single place that had a decent Bloody Mary. Caesar's Palace came the closest, but was still piss poor, and Excalibur was the absolute worst. I can't drink tequila at all. It comes back up as soon as it goes in.
Considering we published on Amazon Kindle, the biggest issue was getting the format right. It was quite the learning process and we are still working on it to make it the very best it can be. The cover is also difficult when you are doing everything yourself. We wanted all of the covers in the series to fit together but that takes a lot of planning. Plus, YA romance books usually have a cover with a young beautiful girl but without the perfect model, and the perfect camera in the perfect place, we had to go with an abstract cover instead.

She didn’t know anything about the music industry. She had no friends in the business All she knew was how to sing. She cursed herself for lacking the drive and ambition. Success was just not coming to her. It occurred to her that she might have to make some calls and link up with bands, make some demos. It made her feel nervous and lonely. Maybe the Rat’s Nest wasn’t so bad.

The book is not sad or sentimental but is told with great humour (some points had me and my husband laughing out loud) openness and honesty. This isn’t going as compelling or as tragic as other memoirs out there as Jackie was adopted by some wonderful people and had a great childhood, that’s why I liked it. The memoir is able to focus more on the nature/nurture split, 60's/70s Scotland and questions like ‘what if your birth parent doesn’t want contact, is it ok to contact your siblings anyway?’
First Dragon Quest 6 cause it's awesome. My favorite of the series, it has got me hooked something awful. The first day I got it i locked myself in my room and played all day. Second day was close to the same. Eventually I could stop playing for awhile haha. I would say it is the second hardest in the series, with the hardest version being Dragon Warrior 2 on NES (and even its remixes on SNES/GBC). For those looking into Dragon Quest, DQ6 might be a tad harder than you are used to, be aware of that, :X
I stiffened a nod.
And now, if there’s a Third Lebanon War, Hezbollah sits in the Lebanese government. It is no longer a militia sitting in south Lebanon. It is a party in the Lebanese government. So if it fires on us, we’ll need a different doctrine covering what to do. The Lebanese government includes a party that has a militia that is firing on you. It’s not the Lebanese Army that is attacking you, but you are being attacked by a force that is in the government.

It was for one of the chocolate shops in the area and they were having their first birthday on my birthday so we thought we would go and check it out. There was a chocolate fondue fountain – oh yeah – and you could just help yourself. We also bought a box of chocolates to take home.

One of the reasons why I like making freehand roses better!) and WALAH! I hope you can see the veins properly, I am a lousy photographer, I think I have mentioned that before.

Home Schooling: I really want to be home schooled. I could do it online. I could if I wanted but I don’t know. I would never see my friends unless on weekends and all that. In high school I would never make new friends or have a girl friend. lol!! But I am really independent. I love being by myself. Don’t get me wrong, I love my friends and social life. I just feel confident on my own a lot. There is a lot of ups and downs about it. The downs is I would probably get FAT! I really am going to check it out. If you know any online homeschooling places in California, please be sure to let me know in the comments below!

He also speaks at length about vegetarianism and the attitudes behind it, as well as the phenomenon of ex-vegetarians (which outnumber their vegetarian counterparts 3 to 1 apparently, and of which I am one). It was a progression that I easily related to, and I thought he nailed the reasoning that leads to this lifestyle for many people. I was "reformed" from my vegetarianism when I realized that animals were going to die whether I ate them or not (I blame 70's Disney movies for my warped relationship with animals), and in the wild it's often a long, slow, painful death. If we give our meat animal of choice a humane life and a dignified death, that makes it okay to eat them, doesn't it? (Who am I kidding? I'm as likely to eat my chickens as I am to eat my cat, dog or rabbit).
James continues to be a happy guy. He is getting some delicious rolls on his previously scrawny arms and legs. And his smiles light up the room. I love that he has "conversations" with us, talking back to us when we talk to him. His current hobbies include staring at his fist, enjoying his baths, and sleeping in his carseat. Dislikes: riding in the car and being left to cry in his room while mom finishes up a blog post. Got to go!

So I phoned them up, went through all the security verification to prove who I was before being told that I needed to write to them in order to close the account, as they needed to compare my signature with the one they had on record. I protested that I was only asking them to transfer the funds into my nominated bank account (that they already had the details of), but soon discovered that I was wrestling with fog.
The move has come under criticism from various quarters who are possibly worried that the designation potentially means that now, as with other what are labelled terrorist groups and/or individuals, movement members can be snatched off the streets, detained indefinitely without access to legal advice, tortured, et cetera, et cetera.

The nose starts out with a bit of a raisin sourness with chocolate and caramel toffee notes. It has a nice dark caramel color that resembles caramel ice cream topping. Taking a sip of this 8.2% ABV brew is a bit misleading as it warms the palate and tends to meander through the malt sweetness. As it warms to room temperature you tend to taste the lightly toasted caramel malt and it balances out. For being a fairly boozy brew, this has a great balance to misrepresent the ABV.

Good morning.......glad I had a chance to recharge my batteries yesterday because today is an action packed day, in fact this entire week is NON STOP. I literally cringed when I looked at my calendar and saw everything going on, but I will get through it as I always do. Since I have been on a kitchen roll, we will continue today on the subject of kitchens. I never ever tire of looking at incredible kitchens...and I have a feeling most of you don't either. Call me a kitchen junkie, I take no offense. I never stop learning and getting inspired, and that is one of the many many things I love about blogging, the constant stimulation that I get from the endless resources and the tremendous amount of inspiration that is derived from so many incredible images that we share with one another.

Around the time I turned 15, my dad and my uncle bought the park where we lived, which contained about 50 trailers. Now, I feel the need to explain something to those of you who are already turning up your noses. You don’t know anything.

Polycraft Monday Challenge #33 is asking for Things With Wings... at first I thought I had nothing to choose from for this challenge and almost needed to buy a digi stamp or two just to play along. This may have been because I looked at the cuties being used by the DT, but this Mo Manning digi stamp (Plump Fairy) suited me quite nicely, especially in the red! She is quite lovely and looks to me like she indeed feels wonderful in her pose. You have to feel wonderful when wearing a red dress! LOL

The last week or so feels like its been out of control!!! We were doing good on this road of TTWD (Or now I think its called Tweed in B'Mans words lol).. We were just putting along.

Anyway things starting crashing when my mouth started running ( GASP you say a womans mouth runs??) Well apparently Tyler forgot that women have mouths that run freely at times. Well He says I was spending to much time on the Internet blogging... OF course I have to argue the fact that i'm not blogging I'm reading. Blogging is when I write something and I hadn't been writing I been reading. Tyler seems to think that blogging is blogging and reading is blogging!!! OK OK Blind rod made its point.

The assignments are all written to the Visual Performing Arts, Career Technical Education, and National Education Technology Standards. Most of the assignments are tried and tested, broken down into easily understandable steps. However this year I have added many new assignments to go with the new software, and I’m not quite sure how they will turn out. Therefore I am evoking the “beta” label (borrowing from computer geekdom). Since I use Macintosh computers, the manual is written specifically for those machines, and now for OS 10.4. But all of the assignments and steps could be adjusted for whatever software and hardware you have available.
When she heard that she immediately said "Okay I'll sign it." and muttered "cracker" under her breath.

Nonadanga, being a rehabilitation place for evicted poor in the City, attracted a lot of poor people migrated from south Bengal. The influx has risen since 2009-10, while AILA, a super cyclone struck south Bengal and left the villages ruined and cultivation impossible as salty sea water, carried by cyclone, entered into the villages and fields. This has become an added plight to the villagers of south Bengal who are already at stress due to continuous crisis in agriculture. Migration from villages, which was already started, took a giant leap and more than 25 percent people left south Bengal for various cities in India, including Kolkata. A lot of them came to Nonadanga, hoping that an eviction drive would not happen in a neighbourhood which is full of rehabilitated people. More than fifty makeshift huts have been erected in front of the rehabilitation flats. A neighbourhood was born barely a year ago, named ‘Majdoor Colony’. The colony has got a neighbour ‘Lake Colony’, which was born a couple of years back. People evicted from other places in the city and who didn’t get the ‘rehabilitation flats’ made up this Colony.

To God, eternal life is an important issue. He doesn’t desire any to be banished from Him for eternity because of Adam's choice. For His love's sake, He gave us Jesus to redeem back to Him what man can’t redeem. Believers can only overcome sin and eternal damnation "by the blood of the Lamb" (Rev. 12:11) There is no other way. Pagan cultures, seduced by myths and lying doctrines of demons have attempted to salvage eternal damnation by ceremony, one of them being vampirism, the sucking of human blood believed to sustain eternal life. Actually, the Bible teaches, "blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God" (1 Cor 15:50).

I ran for a few more years before my knee finally decided to retire without telling the rest of my body, and about 30 years before I wanted it to. Haven't run since. Oh, I've played some frisbee and soccer and stuff like that, and I bike from time to time, and for the most part the knee shows up rather gamely and pretends to be enjoying itself for a while before blowing up like a stinging Puffer Fish and laughing at my expense, sometimes joining in with neck in secret conversations about how best to piss me off. But running for the sake of running? Nope.
Helmet, none too pleased about all this, alleged that Tunnard had (i) breached his duty of fidelity by developing a safety helmet that competed with its own and (ii) breached his fiduciary duties in failing to report his activities while still employed by Helmet. The trial judge rejected these claims, concluding that Tunnard's actions were no more than preparatory to competitive activity. Helmet appealed, arguing that the judge had failed to spot the fiduciary duty owed by Tunnard or to notice that both that duty and his duty of fidelity had been breached. According to Helmet, Tunnard was obliged to advise on competitors' activity and that, since Helmet depended upon the unsupervised fulfilment of Tunnard's obligation, Tunnard owed a duty as a fiduciary.

So I do have to apologize that I have been less than timely with some of the content on this site lately. Over the summer I plan to examine the future direction this blog will take, however in the mean I will continue to review Glee and other pertinent pieces.

There is no doubt in my mind that Skully wouldn't have survived a trip to the nearest 24 hour veterinary hospital which is a good 40 minute drive away. and I was unsure if I could properly perform a tracheo procedure, although Patti might have, but she hasn't been a paramedic for over 30 years.

The stigma also surrounds mental health illness too and that HAS to be stopped! Those who are suffering from the various types of mental health illnesses, depression being one of them and almost always associated with suicide, are afraid to reach out for the very help they need. They are fearful of being judged, of being labelled, embarrassment is often felt and yet if they had cancer or any other disease – and believe me – mental health illness is a disease!, they wouldn’t experience that at all. They’d receive understanding, compassion, empathy and support.

My next thought was: well, instead of buying a supplement, why don’t I just eat a bunch of black olives (black olives have more oleuropein than green olives) and/or eat more olive oil? Here’s the problem with that. The rats were fed 50g of olive oil or 0.15mg of oleuropein per kg of body weight. 50g = 4 tablespoons. In order to get the human equivalent of what the rats were eating, I’d have to consume 40 tablespoons of olive oil a day. Strong bones, but clogged arteries. (40 Tablespoons? Wouldn’t that be like drinking a bottle of olive oil a day?)
Yes it was my birthday and mine and beloved's first wedding anniversary. We had a lazy day and I put my feet up and watched Downton Abbey and several other programmes I had recorded. My mil took us out for dinner later and beloved bought me this for my birthday.

On February 5, 2011 I was discharged from the hospital. I just moved myself down to my girl’s room and parked myself on the recliner. I sat there all day, even refusing to leave to get lunch with my family. It was like I knew that something was going to happen. By the afternoon her nurse seemed concerned that her oxygen levels were going down and that she was having a hard time getting them back up. She called her doctor who watched her and ordered some meds. A few hours later she crashed… her heartbeat went well below 70 and the doctors and nurses crowded into her room trying to get her stable. After about an hour of her crashing, them giving her epinephrine, and chest compressions the doctors figured out that she had fluid built up around her heart. They removed the fluid and she became stable. My husband and I stepped out of the room to get some air and just cry. A few moments later we were called back into the room… she had crashed again. This time the blood vessels in her tiny lungs had burst from all the stress of her original crash. In a moment that I will never forget, her doctor looked at me and said “She is not going to survive this.” I screamed and cried and told them to stop and give her to me. My husband and I held our little girl as she took her last breaths. We held her for hours after that. The nurses took out all the tubes and cleaned her up. I sat in the recliner and rocked her and hummed to her.
The next day, Sunday, had me back to the Grand Tasting earlier than the previous day so I could get it in, make my way to Andrew Zimmern’s Carts in the Parc and return to see my food journalist icon, Anthony Bourdain, at a cooking demo. Though I did see him coming in while Morimoto was murdering some blue crabs, returning for his demo was not to be.

Lego Miniland. This was actually my favorite part of the whole park. They have recreated New York City, The National Mall in D.C., Las Vegas, New Orleans, and probably a half dozen other major places in the world - all out of teeny tiny lego pieces! One single structure takes like 600 hours to build. I'm impressed.

It's definitely not for everyone, certainly not for the easily offended, but the cast is terrific, the writing is sharp, and somehow a show about 5 un-lovable losers just keeps bringing the laughs. I can't explain it, but if you haven't seen it, you're missing out.
To the liberal left mind executing child murdering paedophiles is barbaric and morally reprehensible. They delude themselves that animals like these can somehow be rehabilitated!
In addition, I was pretty convinced at a young age I was ‘African’ because we all came out of Africa and I just happened to be lighter skinned (obviously this will upset some one and I am sorry, but I have read the anthropology). By time I was 10 years old, I knew I was going to the continent of Africa (and I knew it was a continent with very different people as I had met Africans- Muslims, Christians and Animists) and ultimately I did with Peace Corps. My Peace Corps grandmothers looked like me – skin color and nappy hair. They were more surprised their Peace Corps Volunteer was not white and did not have a red one piece Speedo (all the re-runs sold to various African countries of Baywatch). I was ecstatic they looked like me – it was confirmation I was from Africa.

I've been writing a poem a day for National Poetry Writing Month (NaPoWriMo) mainly because a few other poets I know are doing so. There's been a "prompt" every day which I've pretty much ignored, but several days ago the suggestion was a "parody." Without going into detail about they thought by that, I decided to have a go - and in the "mini sequences" within my April writing.

When Little Miss Adorable was a newborn I tried to dress her in neutrals, but somehow pink snuck in. I resisted initially, complaining about drowning in a sea of pink when well-wishers bought countless little pink outfits. As the laundry piled up and I ran out of clean clothes for her I gave up, and started dressing her in pink. Then I argued that it improved her complexion and kept dressing her in pink. I tried offering just gender-neutral toys. Mr. Sensitive’s cars, trains and trucks were strewn across the floor. Little Miss Adorable found the one baby doll I bought for Mr. Sensitive (and that he rejected, but that’s another story). Little Miss Adorable cuddled that baby doll, wrapping it in a blanket, chatting to it. One baby doll led to a half dozen. Little Miss Adorable found the pink tutu I bought for Mr. Sensitive when he was in his princess-dancing phase. She wore it endlessly. It’s as though there is something deep inside of her that is drawn to girly stuff. I call it the Princess Gene. (I could also make a case for the Mommy Gene, but that is also another story.)
Romance isn’t the only relationship to enjoy in this game. Your friendships with the other characters you don’t romance are equally beautiful and satisfying. Characters you have known since the first game and gotten to know in the second one become not only allies for Shepard but friends. Some characters change, especially those who have been with Shepard since the first game. Others remain the same for the most part just with more responsibilities and concerns.
This book is a very assured debut, full of those dreadful moments of realisation that mark growing up: that the world isn’t at all how you thought it was, but instead is messy, unfair, uncontrollable and incomprehensibly different from your expectations. Schabas allows Georgia to speak for herself, showing how the polarisation in ways of thinking about sex is a problem rather than a solution. In this book, the feminist (and concerned family) position is akin to the position of abstinence-only education. Both think they are showing girls how not to be victims; neither understands that mild interest in sex is not the same thing as wanting to have sex, and that a lack of information and culture of extreme disapproval results in girls having sex (and babies) even when they don’t want to. The adults in this book don’t understand that Georgia’s experience of the world is incredibly limited. They don’t recognise that their morals and advice come from a position of overview and lived experience and as such cannot possibly help Georgia make real decisions.
Since the box arrived on Monday, we had to wait nearly a whole week to open it and get it on the wall (we were working on other projects and the noise of it may have woken the kids at night). But we were happy nonetheless to have it sitting in our house. The tube is for another package and the package against the wall holds a piece of glass that goes with our Restore nightstands.

Here's how I get to the first foundation layer with a client. If I can have these three questions flushed out at our first meeting, we are in good shape.
Just before we enter the mountainous “wilderness,” we meet this friendly fella. He walked with us for quite a ways. Apparently, he had a lot of room to roam on his side of the fence. When we reached the end of his domain, we stopped to say good-bye; he dropped his head and, thinking he was encouraging a pat, I reached out to stroke his nose. Good thing I have quick reflexes or I might have lost a finger or two. When will I learn that animals aren’t thinking “friend!” so much as “food?”

I'd love to have big chunks of time.... but if I waited until I had a whole day when nothing else was going on or elderly parents wanting for attention or a mound of washing to see to, I'd never make another card or scrapbook a photo again! Mornings are crazy, but in reality, you only need a few minutes before you leave for work to plan the composition for a new card. When I return home in the evening I may have more time to begin more complicated techniques, such as acrylics or spraying backgrounds.... so that I can leave them to dry until morning, or just a half-hour to finish a card or two... mind you, it can take a week or more to put a project together, but by the end of the week I'll have a completed project and not the regret that comes from making excuses about having no time.

Loved this MFT sketch so decided to play along this week. I found a scrap of this wonderful Pebbles paper and decided to use it to make a spring themed card as I can't wait for Spring to arrive!! Just planted primroses in the planter by my front door and my tulips are beginning to push through the ground so Spring is on my mind big time!

The above image shows a simplified model of the interior of star with the onion-layer structure (with some elements removed for clarity). Just how far it can get up the periodic table depends strongly on a star's mass - only the most massive stars will have the full onion-layer structure I outlined above. Smaller stars such as our Sun might only get to the helium fusion stage...there's simply not enough mass to gravitationally squeeze the core enough to undergo carbon/oxygen fusion. Very small stars may not even be able to start fusing helium.
Writing a novel is all about making a series of decisions. Martin Amis made this point in a conference speech about one of Saul Bellow’s books. He includes it in Visiting Mrs Nabokov, but I can’t check exactly what he says as all my books are in boxes at the moment with builders crawling all over the house. As I remember, Amis describes the process a bit like a decision-tree with Bellow starting with big decisions and then working his way steadfastly down to ever smaller ones. The biggest decisions include the overall structure of the plot, who's the main character, the setting, etc. The small decisions include choices of words.
Have you ever thought that if no one discussed Christ and His merits with you, you would not be saved today? Have you not considered that if you had not shared Christ with your friend, they would still be lost and hell bound? Have you not imagined that the people you will meet in the future will go into a Christless eternity if you hold your peace?

After losing my husband, I thought I would be alone for decades to come. What man in his right mind would want to be with a woman with 6 kids and the kind of baggage I was dealing with. Even if there was someone out there with that level of insanity, I wouldn't even look until one year after the death of my husband. I would find a nice Mormon singles group and make friends and maybe meet someone I could spend time with.

Operation Northern Vigilance was not the only US exercise planned for September 11. A series of war games were also acted out, specifically Global Guardian. Global Guardian is an annual, command-level exercise held in the United States. It is an important task, and the purpose of the drill is to test and validate US nuclear command, control and execution procedures. Vigilant Guardian is an exercise that was run in conjunction with Global Guardian. It involved a simulated bomber attack from the former Soviet Union. The drill was conducted in real time, and appeared legitimate in offices and on computers, but without any planes in the air. One of the drills included was a traditional simulated hijacking.

At about mile 5 I developed a blister at the base of my big-toe on the left foot. A few miles later I got a matching blister on my right foot. By the end of the race my feet were throbbing and walking around the house on Sunday was very uncomfortable. Did I mention that I had picked up a cold from the kids? I was coughing and blowing my nose the whole race. Having it drizzle rain for 10 miles also didn't help. Needless to say I felt pretty miserable by the end (except for the free cookies they were passing out at the finish station).
And you know what that means--we're celebrating the bloodsuckers in both YA books and movies. Today we kick things off with a look at two kinds of vamp boyfriends in YA fiction. To help with today's post, I'll be referring to popular vamps who fit each mold.
A particular highlight was the drive through Frensham village. Set in the midst of the gorgeous Surrey Hills this picturesque village really is the stereotypical quintessential English village with perfect Victorian cottages and church and a little primary school on the village green.

Just as an experiment, I ordered "hot English Breakfast tea" with my meal in a Cracker-Barrel in? might have been mobile Alabama... Anyway, as I'd pretty much expected, I got a teabag (Darjeeling, not EBT), and a small jug of water not warm enough to make a goldfish sweat.

He kept on seeking legal redress, of course. As the government notices of intent kept coming, he applied for a protection order. In 2005, though, an amendment to the Zimbabwean constitution allowed the seizure of white land without court review or compensation. He went higher then, and in 2007 sued Mr Mugabe before the tribunal of the Southern African Development Community. Though 77 other white farmers eventually joined him, he was the first and foremost: Mike Campbell v Republic of Zimbabwe. And, astonishingly, he won—though the tribunal said it would have ruled differently if his land had really been given to poor blacks, rather than the president’s cronies.

Or if you forgo the repentance/apology thing, in a holier-than-thou form of forgiveness, you can then feel cornered into taking up with this person again. A lot of women get pressured into that by some religious outfit that prescribes both forgiveness and submission where husbands are concerned. Religion, and in particular Christianity, has been a formidable enabler of domestic violence because of the way it defines forgiveness.
If you have ever felt this way, I encourage you to please give yourself a break.

I hope to do some volunteering/or work in either helping local indigenous communities or with conservation or both. please could you give me an idea of what your company does, what prices you charge for volunteering (ie food and accomodation) and whether you’d have anything available for the months i desire. I need the information AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE as there is only a few months until june and i will need to book my flights and organise it quickly. Please let me know what projects you have and what is involved in these projects. I would prefer something that is relatively inexpensive, ie I just pay my food and accommodation etc. I speak quite good spanish already and i have lots of travel experience in south america.

Firstly, let’s start with that nonsense that homosexuality is unnatural. It’s honestly quite hard to justify this. Estimates on the number of homosexuals in the world vary, but it’s general considered that, in societies where homosexuality is not actively discriminated against, about 10% of the population is gay. That might not be much, but if you were on a bus with another twenty or so people, chances are, two of you are gay. If you take that same population and consider how many people on that bus are train-spotters, or professional artists, you might begin to realise that 10% isn’t especially small. It’s important to remember that being part of a minority does not make you abnormal.
Frankly, the reason for this emotional roller coaster is because that dreaded day, the D-Day Antiversary, is fast approaching. It’s tomorrow, April 5th. Only a mere 2 years ago, my husband was ‘in love’ with another woman and was ready to leave me and our then 11 years of marriage for his fantasy. I have been moping on and off around the house these past few weeks. Falling into sleep has been impossible and of course the occasional crying or trying to suppress the cry because he is near. Tomorrow, my husband has an extra day of holiday for Easter weekend and we will most likely spend time with our baby as a family. I hope the worst day this week will possibly be the best one yet. And I’ll try not to let myself be drowned by the memory of the Affair.
You should all go buy this record immediately and listen to it immediately afterwards, but before you do there is one caveat: skip the first track. It finds Alec Ounsworth barking like a carnival huckster, and the band seemingly doing everything they can to make you stop listening (interestingly, it makes a much better final track, and because it was designed to be the first, it leads into the second quite well and so the record has great flow even when put on repeat). But after that first off-putting song, it settles into a sublime groove, a drone that ebbs and flows (good Lord did I really just type that?) with little regard for hooks or traditional songcraft. Notable exceptions include "Over and Over Again (Lost and Found)," where CYHSY find not only a great vocal hook, but supplement it with a a great guitar hook, and "Is This Love?", with its incredible chorus. Lots of bands are described as "having a sound uniquely their own;" few earn it as CYHSY did.

Before we returned home, Maidei stopped by for a bison ride at Fort Calgary, a heritage site of the former North West Mounted Police, now the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The bison icon to Alberta is like the salmon is to British Columbia –ubiquitous but appropriate as part of a local area’s natural history.

Significantly, the Better Book Company do not describe themselves as a ‘publisher’, and rightly so. They are a printer who have expanded into offering design, editorial and marketing services for authors considering self-publishing. They very much see themselves as providing a service. All books designed by them are published under their author’s imprint and the files for the final product are given to the author on a CD.

Know this – if God encounters you – it is for a purpose. Deuteronomy 29:29 tells us this; The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our sons forever, that we may observe all the words of this law. God always has a purpose when he encounters us and a message that is meant directly for us. God’s message will be one where we are encouraged to obey God and observe what he tells us to do. When you encounter God – He is going to give you a message that will give you purpose in life! He has a purpose for you so find it and live in that purpose!

So, I also have the large Yudu and I have used it a few times with some success. The most worrisome part for me is burning the screen and just hoping it comes out right. I think it's because the emulsion sheets that came with the Yudu were not good, they had been exposed or something, which of course I didn't know until I used them and my screen did not burn properly. When I got some new sheets and tried them, they worked great and I've been able to do a few small projects. I've also tried the liquid emulsion and like it too. Anyway, for me, there is such a sense of relief when I rinse the screen after burning it and the image comes out exactly as it should!

Whole of last night my brain buzzing with this quarry in Blanchisseuse thing….then I wake up this morning to read that the PM play the gender card again and my morning derailed.
There’s a nice mythological angle layered on top of everything, as the planet killer is theorized to be a “doomsday machine,” a machine so powerful that it would never need to be used. The front of the ship looks like a whale shark opening its mouth to collect plankton, and there’s some really good battle sequences between the planet killer and the Enterprise, something rarely seen in TOS. The Enterprise faces destruction every other week, of course, but this time around I really felt the danger. There’s just something menacing about this slow-moving, all-powerful machine, operating without any discernible captain or crew. It just eats, and what it eats are planets.
That afternoon, Husseini met an Amal official he knew slightly and told him, 'I'm heading to Libya -- is there anything I can do for you there?' 'No, have a good trip and give my regards to Imam Sadr,' was the reply. Husseini answered, 'Whatever you say, but you might as well know your friend isn't coming back.'

Well it's been very quiet here on the homefront...you can tell fall is sneaking in and leaving us confused as to why Starbucks was offering pumpkin spiced lattes at the eng of August (I'm not complaining, just an observation), and why I have been wearing boots & sweaters all week and it's just days past Labor Day. Well, apparently summer came and went, what felt like overnight. Literally.
The match factory was an awful place to work, not only because of the bad pay and long hours and usual bad factory conditions but working with phosphorous caused a terrible condition called phossy jaw The story of the strike is so interesting in itself that it deserves a blog of its own!

But other than the shopping I’m bored. I’ve finished three romance novels in a week. I don’t read. Ever. I am kind of surprised that I even thought of it but Georgia can hog the projector for hours either watching vids or bidding on art. I don’t even think she really likes the art I just think she tries to seem cultured.

By doing so, we are exposing the real face of the government bereft any shred of humanism that has taken adivasi areas as some tourism commodity, as though these places are habitats of apes and chimpanzees. We are requesting the common mass to raise voice against turning adivasi areas into tourism commodities. Having arrested these two Italian culprits, we are also releasing two Odia slaves of theirs—Santosh and Kartik.

Let me add my personal twist before answering the question. Nemesis was the first Trek film besides The Motion Picture I did not rush to see. It was released during exam time in my second year of law school. Chalk it up to my being frazzled by briefs and oral arguments, but Nemesis did not inspire the enthusiasm in me most trek did. Granted, I was also at a Christian law school in which the largely vanilla study body thought enjoying science fiction was one step below practicing witchcraft, so I had to keep my enjoyment on the down low. It was tough. Insurrection had been released on my birthday in 1998. I went to see it with a couple friends and we made a day of it. Nothing like that could ever happen at Savonarollas at regent.

Anyway, that is me for today. Going to watch Phantom in Manchester, beyond excited. It is my fourth time seeing this show and could watch it every day .. I love it! Matt, my husband hasn't seen the stage version so he can't wait either. Gonna be a good one, sure I will be raving about it on Tuesday!!
Which explains why this week was a creative failure. I'm too exhausted to think straight, much less be creative. It's all I can do to work on editing my WIP and writing on the sci-fi novel I started.

Here’s a fan-made trailer:
Af had been Van Raighan's third robbery. Before that... Pevan struggled for the memory. Had it been Edarrin before Af? Polten had been the first. She could see the map in her head, the map that the Sherriff had used to track Van Raighan's progress, with its bold pencil line connecting the seven towns he'd hit, but she couldn't make out the names. The best she could do was make a vague gesture and hope he'd fill in. "You're sure you didn't leave any clues at Polten, or...?'
Again, I am NOT suggesting that anyone who contacts me is obligated to hire me. Far from it. All I'm suggesting is that once someone has opened up a dialogue with me, we should have an actual dialogue! In fact, it's that dialogue that helps them -- and me -- determine if we're a good fit for each other, or not.

Earlier this evening we heard the mournful death cries of a large animal - possibly a buffalo - being taken down by a predator. We couldn't see what or where this was happening but the cries carried far and wide across the grassy floodplains. There were some splashing sounds as if this was all taking place at the edge of the water or one of the pools.

My relationship isn’t perfect. I don’t talk a lot about my boyfriend on the blog because we’ve had ups and downs. We moved in together, we gutted his house, I moved out, we broke up, we grew on our own, and we eventually got back together. Our story, while quite fitting for a romantic comedy, doesn’t translate into the fairy-tale nature of blogland, so I’ve just kept it private.

Savannah shot me a raised-eyebrow, dubious look back. I carefully avoided eye contact with the woman because obviously, only crazy people get so close for no particular reason. The fact that I wasn’t being very neighborly only played at the fringes of my mind as I studiously ignored the woman. Although, honestly, it wasn’t really a conscious decision to avoid the woman; it just sort of came naturally. It’s not that I don’t like talking to people, but I guess it’s simply easier to stay in my own world with blinders on to everything else.
Now, I can’t do this – fall asleep to movies. Because when I watch movies it’s a fully-there, fully-focused, all systems engaged kind of process. That’s why I don’t usually like watching them more than once. If I’ve seen it unfold once, I don’t feel the same thrill I felt when I watch it all again. At least, that used to be my theory.
When we engage in sexuality, it is a time for heightened consciousness, not the release of such. When we let go of our spiritual attention and engage in sexuality, we amplify our already present tendency to want. Whenever there is wanting, there is interference. When we want through sex, we become downloading stations for interference and amplify our own state of disconnection. Though a momentary feeling of bliss through orgasm feels great, most of us have no idea what really went on in the unseen while we temporarily reached such heights.

And Eva, who has always been able to see ghosts, knows several of them by name or appearance: pathetic lonely boy St John in the nursery, spiteful Maggie the chambermaid, the Stalker, who is heard but not seen, and the terrifying Witch in the cellar. (I remembered briefly that Rhiannon believed as a small child that a terrifying Witch haunted our cloakroom that had the high level flush). Perhaps the saddest ghost is that of Adeline, Eva’s mother, occasionally glimpsed rowing a wooden boat on the lake like Waterhouse’s Lady of Shalott.
Perhaps it’s just that I am lazy. Or maybe that my inner 6-year old is lazy. I find myself wishing for a stay at home wife (not sure how the husband would react to that!) who could help out with being the grown-up. When I think of my parents (and other people’s parents), they always seemed so sure of themselves – even when they were making bad choices.

Men can choose to wear collared t shirts, khaki shorts and strappy sandals or topsiders. They can wear plain shirts with solid colours such as blue, green, black or grey. V-neck t shirts and crew neck shirts are popular choices. The rule of the thumb is the more comfortable they are, the better.

8. Virtual Schools: I am not a fan of virtual schools myself because of the govenrmental involvement in my homeschooling experience, but for some it can be a real money and life saver. When I lived in Florida, they had a virtual school that met at the Zoo one day a week and the kids were taught hands-on about animals, did creative writing, and had an art class. It was great for that time of our life. Some virtual schools will offer assistance with choosing curriculum, provide money for curriculum, or possibly even a provide a computer. Check out what your state has to offer.

The Man Called Flintstone is a 1966 American animated musical comedy film produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and released by Columbia Pictures. It was the second Hanna-Barbera feature, after Hey There, It's Yogi Bear! (1964). The film is a theatrical spin-off of the 1960-66 television series, The Flintstones, and is a swan song of the TV show, made immediately following the end of production on the series. The working title of the film was That Man Flintstone, with the film poster featuring Fred in the same pose of the Bob Peak poster for Our Man Flint. The film is a parody of the James Bond films.

I've been a fan for decades now (and I'm not that old, I just started watching very young!) and I love watching darts now just as much as I did back then. December to January in our house is "darts time" as far as we're concerned. Stuff Christmas, it's the darts we look forward to, those few weeks of The Professional World Darts Championship followed by the BDO World Championship. And then there's the Premier League of Darts, the UK Open... basically, if darts is on the telly then I'm usually there, watching - unless there's a Keanu Reeves film on the other side then I could be swayed, especially if it's 'Point Break'... sorry, where was I? Oh, yeah, darts... I have my favourite players, of course I do, I always have done, and it's when these particular players are on that I have been known to become slightly more on edge, unable to watch without the use of language my mother would not be proud of, and an inordinate amount of fidgeting on my part.
