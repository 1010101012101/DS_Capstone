Coach's comment: "I've had some teams that were really good and didn't do anything special. I had so-so teams that I had to work my rear end off. This year was different. I had a really good team, and I worked my rear end off. So it was the best of both worlds. I knew right from the beginning we would be very good. It doesn't come around very often where you have 11 girls who could have started for any team. It was the deepest team I've ever had . . .

Yet the pursuit is manipulative and repetitive -- how many times can Chris, who sells bone-density scanners, chase after someone who's stolen one of his machines? And the hero outruns any questions about material wealth as a panacea. For a while those questions seem significant, but then the film's sense of irony disappears. The deeper Chris falls into poverty, the more convinced he seems to be that money will buy happyness as advertised. That poverty is deep, almost Dickensian: The script was written by Steve Conrad, who wrote a singularly bleak movie called "The Weather Man." Be prepared, then, to feel good and feel bad, though not necessarily in that order.
The Croque Madame was definitely not diet food, so we doubled down, substituting sweet potato fries for the salad or chips usually served with sandwiches (an additional $2). The sweet and crunchy fries came with a sriracha-lime sauce that had a surprisingly good balance of cream, acid and heat. The fries were good on their own, but with the sauce, they were top-notch.

In all, the appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday had the unmistakable air of Biden being Biden, an admirable habit of the vice president saying what he really thinks even when it makes the president uncomfortable. And on this topic, the president deserves to be made uncomfortable. Mr. Obama's description of his own views on same-sex marriage as "evolving" sounds too cute by half. Either he believes that all men and women should have the same state-sanctioned right to marriage, or he doesn't. Either he thinks that the children of gay and lesbian couples deserve the same protections as their peers, or he doesn't.

The plan is so dead on arrival in the Senate that it can only be seen as slightly worsening the debt by its printing costs alone.

I blame this on the "how to raise your child" industry and its conclusion children will be easier to potty train if they want to wear underwear, so parents should buy underwear kids like, such as ones that sport pictures of their favorite things. And it worked: If he went to the potty, he got to wear his underwear with the cartoon characters on the rear. But this is where we went wrong. For a child, the important part isn't wearing cartoon underwear, it's being able to see the cartoons once they are on.
Nick's was the best place to watch a ball game in Portland -- its walls a testament to Nudo's fondness for the Yankees, the Ducks and Neil Diamond -- and the best place to eat a chili dog.

My perspective: My husband, Fred, and I are well-traveled, so when it came time to decide where to go on our honeymoon last year, we wanted to choose somewhere we'd never been. We love Las Vegas (and gambling) and try to go there several times a year, so when we started noticing a lot of press about Macao, we thought it might be perfect for us. We decided on a two-week trip to Hong Kong, Macao, Bangkok and Malaysia. Hong Kong was the highlight; Macao was the low point. The ads and stories we'd seen about Macao made it seem as though it was the Las Vegas of Asia. Not so. It was more like the Las Vegas of 1970. Multiple Las Vegas casino companies have built hotels there in an effort to tap into the huge Asian gambling market. We stayed at the Wynn, which looked just like its Vegas sister; our room, a suite, was beautiful. But when we ventured downstairs to the gaming floor, we knew we were in for a different experience. To enter the gaming area, you had to pass through a metal detector and be patted down by a security guard. Once on the floor, we noticed something strange: It was very quiet. No music playing, no slot machines dinging, no loud cheers coming from the craps table, just low murmuring voices. It was so quiet that we spoke to each other in hushed tones. The tables were all packed in the middle of the day, and these people were serious about their gambling. We were also overdressed. When we go to Vegas, part of the fun is getting dressed up and getting into a festive mood. These people were dressed for Thursday night bingo at a VFW hall. Macao is not catering to international tourists, just serious Asian gamblers. Other than the few American casinos that have opened up, Macao is mostly populated by old, rundown Chinese casinos and most of the area looks like the older parts of Vegas. We ended up spending most of our time in the room, or out shopping, as the gambling wasn't very fun and Macao doesn't have all the shows and exhibits that Vegas does. We were there in January, so the weather wasn't very conducive to sightseeing, as it was cold and raining most of the time. I would've liked to have gotten out and seen some of the historic parts of town. On the upside, the restaurants were great and the options for shopping were just as good as the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace. Bottom line, unless you're a very serious gambler, I would stay away from Macao and get my kicks in Vegas.

happy to say that the film that was made out of the exposé that I did lasted longer than the clubs it was exposing. There is a kind of horrible fascination, and there's a lot of money there, and so on, but somehow I don't feel threatened by that. I feel dismay that young men, especially, are being subjected to that and made to feel that that's a mark of masculinity. You know, that is a shame.

Ideally those neighbor-bonding conversations would take place face-to-face, but research indicates that it isn't happening as much as it used to.

Some history: The Wente Chardonnay clone, from cuttings imported in 1912 from Montpellier, France, is the progenitor of many California Chardonnays - including Chateau Montelena's winning entry in the "Judgment of Paris" in 1976, when just a few thousand acres of the grape were planted in the state. The grape now accounts for more than 100,000 acres. Chardonnay was first marketed in California on a Wente label (it was called "Pinot Chardonnay" at the time); today, Wente's most popular wines include the rich Riva Ranch Chardonnay from Monterey and the oak-focused Morning Fog Chardonnay from Livermore.

No. I feel like I have arm strength that’s equal to his. But that’s probably my strongest asset. Maybe he threw the ball a couple of miles per hour harder, but what was impressive was that his throwing motion was so short, so compact and accurate. Have I ever seen a better catcher, throwing-wise? No, he was the best.

Snow play: Leland Snow Play off Highway 108 in the Stanislaus National Forest. The problem with taking youngsters to a hill is you have to keep walking up the hill, and then the kids get cold.

* The Cardinals are winning because catcher Yadier Molina is one of the best players in baseball. The industry knows about his gold-plated defense; it's the basis for his strong rep. But Molina has developed into a legitimately good hitter, and his offense is no fluke. Molina has 3 homers, 4 doubles, 10 RBIs and is batting .358. This is a continuation of what he started last season.

Just 150 yen buy a stick of grilled eel in sweet sauce. There are brocaded hot pads and wooden dipping cups used to get water from the city's many springs. There's also a store selling military-themed clothes and surplus — much of it American. The military goods are reminders that Kyoto was the seat of the myth-based and often racially tinged supremacy policy underpinning the Japanese war effort in World War II. The professors of Kyoto University drew upon the traditions of the ancient city to promote the war as a way to purify the nation. Even in a place of harmony so peaceful, ideas of a different sort once held sway.

Yes, divided partisans can quickly unite when it comes to regulating their critics.
You see, our predecessors understood that government could not, and should not, solve every problem. They understood that there are instances when the gains in security from government action are not worth the added constraints on our freedom. But they also understood that the danger of too much government is matched by the perils of too little; that without the leavening hand of wise policy, markets can crash, monopolies can stifle competition, and the vulnerable can be exploited. And they knew that when any government measure, no matter how carefully crafted or beneficial, is subject to scorn; when any efforts to help people in need are attacked as un-American; when facts and reason are thrown overboard and only timidity passes for wisdom, and we can no longer even engage in a civil conversation with each other over the things that truly matter - that at that point we don't merely lose our capacity to solve big challenges. We lose something essential about ourselves.
Would this be - shudder - dread isolationism? Not if accompanied by utterly free trade with every country and an open immigration policy. And if we don't have troops and commercial interests involved, we might be more effective at promoting human rights.
They might tell us that they were born to a teen parent; and finally, they might tell us that more than anything they want to be good parents. Not all pregnant teens share a history of trauma and isolation -- but in our work, we find that many do.

Vice President Joe Biden and Richard Holbrooke, special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, have confronted Karzai in public, with no results. So it's been fascinating to watch the impact of the softer approach tried on Obama's behalf by Sen. John Kerry (backed up by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's phone calls).
"Please do not allow us to be evicted from our home church," she said. "Please allow us to continue our ministry at this iconic location."
While Obama in 2008 won the total Catholic vote, 54 percent to Sen. John McCain's 45 percent, he lost the white Catholic vote, 52 percent to 47 percent, according to exit polls. Once reliably Democratic, Catholics are now swing voters, with white Catholics making up the majority of the group.

"Guys and Dolls" -- Sept. 23-Oct. 26, 2008, main stage. Somehow his name doesn't create the instant associations that come with, say, George Gershwin or Cole Porter, but Frank Loesser belongs in any discussion of the greatest craftsmen of American popular song. His tunes such as "Luck Be a Lady" and "A Bushel and a Peck" helped this show earn the Tony Award for best musical in 1951. The book, written by Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows and based on a Damon Runyon story, turns low-down gangsters, gamblers and molls into charmingly entertaining American archetypes. Chris Coleman will direct.

Beard's pork chop ($22), thick and about the size of a T-bone steak, is served in a bowl with mashed potatoes and black trumpet mushroom jus. Beard doesn't subscribe to the trend of adding a sweet element to the pork; instead the earthiness of the mushrooms draws out the natural sweetness of the meat. The one drawback was that the bowl made it hard to cut the chop.

For most bands, this would have been a career. But Kool and the Gang was just getting started. No other ’70s funk band weathered the disco craze as well. To adapt to the changing sound of popular music, Kool and the Gang added a singer and frontman — something they’d never had before. Hackensack’s James “J.T.” Taylor joined the group in 1978; by ’79, he had helped Kool and the Gang harness the power of the funk to catchy contemporary pop.
The state law was enacted as a way to generate $31 billion in revenue to pay for road, bridge and school construction. Each eligible establishment may have a maximum of five video gaming terminals.

Howard, who is headed to the University of Illinois, was in shock following the finale.
The Wawona Hotel: Opened around 1879, this white-washed, two-story Victorian hotel is a great place to stay -- with a caveat. Originally built as a stage stop, the Wawona Hotel is located four miles from the park entrance and 45 minutes away from Yosemite Valley. It is a historic inn with 104 rooms; 54 of the rooms have shared access to bathrooms and showers. Surrounded by windows, the dining room is really peaceful and has some quaint, little hanging lamps decorated with pinecones. The main lobby and long covered front porch are quiet, relaxing places. On some nights, live piano music wafts through the air. The room decor reflects the turn-of-the-century mood with quilts and white furniture. My room was just a little larger than the queen-sized bed and slightly larger than a closet, with no bathroom, no television and no phone. The caveat? Some of the staff (not all) seemed worn-out and tired of tourists during my stay. Contact: (801) 559-4884, www.yosemitepark.com/Accommodations.aspx

But presidential eloquence alone won't save these Iraqis. There is one obvious way to clear the logjam: an airlift to remove our Iraqi friends from danger.
The trial of Paul Schurick is another example of how corrupt politics in this country have become. Our soldiers are overseas fighting and dying so oppressed people can gain the right to vote. After all the bloodshed in Iraq, the Iraqi people were given the ability to decide who will lead their country. Some walked tremendous distances and were so jubilant after voting, showing off their inked finger as proof that they cast a vote. And here in Maryland we have people scheming on how to stop people from voting.

The column implies the city irresponsibly arrived at the conclusion to improve California Avenue by applying newly learned "zinging ideas" to local issues.

Mayweather is coming off a controversial, fourth-round knockout of Victor Ortiz on Sept. 17, a fight in which he was intentionally head-butted by Ortiz, who then tried to apologize. When Ortiz again sought to make amends, dropping his hands and attempting to initiate a hug, Mayweather clocked him with a left jab and overhand right. That might have offended purists, but Mayweather’s actions were within the rules that mandate that fighters defend themselves at all times.

Q: I've attached pictures of my golden barrel cactus. I transplanted it from a large pot to my backyard when it outgrew the pot. It was one barrel surrounded by many pups and was beautiful. It did OK the first year, but in the last six months the center is caving in and turning brown, particularly on the south side. It keeps getting worse, and now some of the pups on that side are shrinking. It gets direct morning/early afternoon sun, but is in shade in late afternoon. What can I do?

No one on the right is calling for additional restrictions on birth control or contraceptive access. The debate has nothing to do with birth control and women's rights. It is, however, about something more important, and that is the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution which all politicians have taken an oath to uphold and support. President Obama has, under recently-adopted regulations stemming from his health care reform law, dictated that Catholic and other religious institutions and employers (and their insurance providers) must provide certain free birth control and contraceptive means and services, which are contrary to their basic religious tenets and beliefs. That is a violation of the First Amendment. I am not Catholic, but an assault on their First Amendment liberties should concern us all.

The decline in big law jobs and the rise of small firms created a shakeout: As top firms took on fewer top-performing students, those students jockeyed for placement at mid-level firms, congesting the applicant traffic there and pushing some mid-level competitors down further.

The attitude of GOP leaders such as Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay was "if you don't agree with me, you must be a Commie simp from San Francisco, and your mother wore combat boots. Instead of getting angry, they tried to trash somebody. And Nancy Pelosi is not going to do that.''

I know, it's silly to talk about a team going undefeated before a game has been played. But I can't blame anyone who is already thinking on it. I spent the last few weeks affording Oregon one little loss. One hiccup. One Saturday occasion in which things go wrong. I figured it was the season opener. But now LSU is dealing with off-field issues, and Oregon feels like the pick.

His performance left them no choice. Chacin's exit creates options. The Rockies plan to add a reliever for the weekend series against the Braves — Zach Putnam is a leading candidate — while weighing their Monday options in San Diego. Drew Pomeranz, who delivered a career-best performance Wednesday, is tentatively scheduled to start on normal rest Monday against the Padres, followed by Jeremy Guthrie on Tuesday. That would leave Guillermo Moscoso in the rotation. He has been challenged to step up after a disappointing debut Saturday.

Answer: The gnats you are experiencing are called fungus gnats. The adult gnats won't hurt your plants, but their larvae can seriously damage feeder roots and root hairs and can cause a loss of vigor to your houseplants.

Before the budget even made it to Christie’s desk, Democrats were already planning to come back this week and vote to override his vetoes.

Despite all four members acting as producers, the EP doesn't have a too-many-cooks-in-the-kitchen feel, said Manzano. Instead, he feels the chemistry is evident through the music's creativity, which ranges from the ambient and electronic "ThreeSeas" to the bass-heavy "Freakon."

Even if the Trayvon Martin case does not really illustrate the shortcomings of Florida's law, it is possible that eliminating the duty to retreat in public places, combined with reinforcing the "castle doctrine" (which applies to home invasions) and extending it to vehicles, has encouraged avoidable escalations of violence. The law's opponents note that the annual number of justifiable homicides in Florida (excluding police shootings) nearly tripled after the law was passed in 2005, from an average of 12 from 2000 to 2004 to an average of 35 from 2006 to 2010.

3. Be realistic. According to Kantrowitz, a student who borrows less than their expected starting salary should be able to repay their student loans in about 10 years. However, when students borrow more than this, it is likely that they will struggle to repay the debt. Note: not paying back your student loans is not an option. (Read "The Realities of Debt Repayment" for more advice) Alternate repayment plans, such as extended repayment or income-based repayment, do exist and can be helpful, but ultimately these extensions simply increase the total interest paid over the life of the loan.

The elaborate strapwork-filigree carving of the banisters on the staircases and walkway reflects novel tastes, and recalls nothing so strongly as the interlaced style of Parisian bookbindings that would become synonymous with Jean Arnould, called Picard, whose 1540s designs earned him the sobriquet of the Entrelac Binder.

Fleurs-de-lys emerge from knotted, intertwined strapwork.

How we move around our country — Cars? Bicycles? High-speed rail? — is a big issue in environmentalism, and "Just Fine the Way They Are" by Connie Nordhielm Wooldridge, illustrated by Richard Walz (Calkins Creek/Boyds Mills: $17.95, ages 8 and up) shows readers that making decisions about technical progress is not always easy. Beginning in 1805 and hitting every new transportation fad along the way, the book gives a history of U.S. roads, from dirt track to superhighway. At every point, there were people who embraced new technologies (bicyclists "claimed the act of walking was on its last legs!") and people who thought things were "just fine the way they were." That's a fine philosophical debate to introduce to budding environmentalists.

About 97.3 million Americans fall into a low-income category, commonly defined as those earning between 100 and 199 percent of the poverty level, based on a new supplemental measure by the Census Bureau that is designed to provide a fuller picture of poverty. Together with the 49.1 million who fall below the poverty line and are counted as poor, they number 146.4 million, or 48 percent of the U.S. population.

We will fall for the con job that says we can just plow ahead and someone else will pick up the tab. We will allow ourselves to be pitted one against the other, blaming our neighbor for troubles worldwide trends or our own government has caused.

The QB lined up under center with a RB behind him, and they ran a half-hearted play fake that no one in Candlestick Park bought. What were they thinking? Do these silly calls happen to every team during the course of an NFL game, or is it indicative of sub-par game management by the offensive coaches in Cleveland this year? -- JT, San Diego

I wonder what it would be like to go through life and never, ever be able to tell someone off, or get angry or upset. Even the best of relationships have their arguments and tense moments.

Failure scenarios may include an owner stepping on a tail or startling it when it’s sleeping. There may be a number of other reasons why a dog would growl.
Help wanted: As welcome as Washington's long-overdue attention to fiscal issues may be, many millions of Americans worry a lot more about finding a job or affording gas next week than they do about Medicare's long-term health. Gallup reports that while 17 percent of Americans say the deficit is their No. 1 issue -- more than at any time since 1996 -- it still rates behind unemployment (19 percent) and the overall economy (26 percent). And this week's sluggish first-quarter growth numbers won't change that. Freshman Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, concerned that the GOP will turn off voters if it's perceived as simply the penny-pinching Party of No, has been urging his colleagues to start talking more about job creation. Next week, Portman will offer a package of proposals -- on taxes, energy and trade, among other things -- to give them something to talk about. The debt ceiling and ongoing budget battles will continue to suck up lots of oxygen -- Vice President Joe Biden and a bipartisan group of lawmakers begin their search of a broad fix next week -- but look for President Barack Obama and his administration to focus more on growth as well.
