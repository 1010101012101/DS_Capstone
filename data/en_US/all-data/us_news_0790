When Johnson was in college, for instance, he convinced the college president to let him assist in picking which students got campus jobs. As Mr. Caro writes in "The Passage of Power," "The wages from a campus job were often a student's only hope of paying his tuition." Spitefully, Johnson wouldn't recommend a student for a job unless he personally asked for his assistance.

I adopted Ozzy from the Cleveland APL about a year ago. I was there late one night and spotted him in a cage in the lobby. He called me over and pretty much demanded that I adopt him as an office cat. So now we're Ozzy and Sharon, and he definitely has an Ozzy Osbourne take on life. I, on the other hand, have resigned myself to being the sensible one!

Working with the Fathers Support Center of St. Louis, I sponsored and passed two bills that will transform our child-support system. One will help fathers struggling to pay child support avoid felony convictions and jail time by creating "fathering courts" to help non-violent offenders find jobs and resume support payments, saving the state millions in incarceration costs. The second will reduce erroneous paternity judgments and ensure that men with DNA tests showing non-paternity will no longer have to pay for children who are not theirs.

What the evening at Reliant Stadium before a crowd of 70,376 lacked in artfulness, it made up in intensity, as these games tend to do, but that was a lot to make up for.

And that's the sting that will linger for a lifetime, because unless they meet again in the Big 12 tournament, this could forever be the final installment of a 105-year-old rivalry. It's the sort of loss that has no rebuttal, and even the fact that it was so well played offers little solace to anyone who wears black and gold.
"We continue to check the safety and integrity of our nuclear stations, but 'stress test' is a political phrase without substance," said Ladislav Kriz, a spokesman for CEZ.
Our 18-month-old, Tiny Bits, is the worst. His brothers love bath time. Tiny Bits thinks bath time should be outlawed by the United Nations. When I'm taking a bath, he barges in -- this must be genetic; my family must have barged into bathrooms all throughout history -- and pulls the shower curtain back.

He wasn't well-known in America, but French crooner and actor Serge Gainsbourg was like Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan and Frank Sinatra rolled into one unfiltered cigarette.

Reputable IVF centers do not create "octomoms," nor do they introduce multiple embryos with the idea to reduce them. Reputable IVF centers do give couples the best chance to create that biological family. Because this is such a costly and time-sensitive process for many couples, only the best fertilized embryos are used. The "discarded" ones are those that have never developed past a few cells, and would not have developed, under any circumstances, into a living baby. Embryos that are frozen but not implanted are at the disposition of the parents (only) to keep frozen, donate to another couple, donate to research or dispose of.

For a home cook, the biggest challenge in reproducing a pot-au-feu may be finding the right pots. You need a large vessel, 16 quarts or more, to accommodate all the meats and vegetables - preferably a wide pot rather than a tall one so you can easily retrieve the meats as they are done and readily skim impurities from the surface. All-Clad makes a 16-quart stockpot in this wide shape; a tall stockpot will work, but is not ideal. You also need a second large, low-sided pot to poach the vegetables for serving.
The Bears sent defensive line coach Mike Phair to Boise to put McClellin through a private workout. McClellin had dropped down to about 250 pounds for the Senior Bowl to show teams he was versatile as an outside linebacker and that is where he played that week.

What would one of these be like as a moving, living world?

Force Medicare beneficiaries who want more to pay more, and if all they can afford are minimum benefits, that is all they should have.

If I am correct, it is the rural lawmakers who because of their numbers in the legislature can repeal voter initiatives that they and/or their constituents don't like that cause us forgotten urban folks to have a diminished voice.

† If you have a nasty relationship with your children's other parent, ask for intervention support from friends or family members if needed. One situation where you might want help is with pick up and drop-off of your children. A friend or family member can remain neutral when seeing your ex where you might not be able to. If things become too difficult with your ex, ask your local police department if they accommodate pick up and drop off needs for divorced couples. With that said, save this move only as a last resort so your children will not have to spend time in a police station unnecessarily.

The humble image of Savigny-lès-Beaune is slightly compromised by the presence of Domaine Chandon de Briailles, an 18th-century limestone manor house set within a small park laid out by the great landscape designer André le Nôtre, who created the gardens of Versailles. Since 1834, the domain has belonged to the noble de Nicolay family, but for much of the 20th century it was neglected until Nadine de Nicolay moved down from Paris in 1984 to take charge. (She has since been joined by her children, Claude and François.) Knowing virtually nothing about viticulture or winemaking, Ms. de Nicolay learned on the job, converting to organic and eventually biodynamic farming and transforming an undistinguished estate into a very good one. Although the domain is probably best known for its grand cru Cortons, from the appellation just north of Savigny, it also makes several excellent Savigny-lès-Beaunes, including the premier cru Fourneaux and Lavières and a lighter village red, all for less than the average Russian River Pinot Noir.

As good as the chorizo and eggs are, I'd be hard pressed to decide between that and the eggs Benedict ($9.50), a spicy tomato-tinged take on the classic where the poached egg yolks ooze into the chipotle hollandaise. Egg- and butter-based hollandaise can end up too heavy or thick, but here, it's as light as a whisper.
The report, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Trenton and made public today, is several months overdue, but federal officials say the State Police are now capable of monitoring themselves.
Where to stay: Try to stay at a downtown hotel, which puts you right in the middle of the action. Top choices include the lavish Admiral Semmes Hotel (251 Government St.; 251-432-8000; www.admiralsemmeshotel.com) and the Battle House Renaissance Mobile Hotel & Spa (26 N. Royal St.; 251-338-2000; www.marriott.com). Downtown hotels can be quite pricey during the festival, so budget-conscious travelers might consider staying in a nearby city, such as Daphne or Fairhope.

When Miller signed Turner to a scholarship, he knew his prize catch might be a "one-and-done" player making a brief stop in Tucson on his way to the NBA.
During the course of camp Matheny made it his task to seek out as many players as possible each day. He wanted to be seen as approachable and sincerely interested in the players' feedback. That played a part in some changes within the spring training program and gained him instant credibility among those uncertain of how a transition would work. Matheny is the game's youngest manager. His inexperience is well-chronicled. However, players can also relate to him.

øI like music that hasn't been used. Sometimes it takes me months to find out what I want to compete with. This year each of my songs are totally different, which I love. I want to show that versatility and show all the different ways I can perform. For ribbon I have a Ricky Martin song, so it's really dancy. It's called Jezebel. It's on the sexier side, which my dad didn't necessarily like at first.

"And that happened everywhere. 'Where do we eat in this town that has no places where blacks can eat?' And somebody would say, 'Here is a man who was a chef at the Waldorf Astoria, but he's retired and he cooks sometimes for visitors.' And you go to his house and get the best meal of your life. But that was within the community. There really was a community, there really was a neighborhood."

The next morning, bright sun warms the sloping piazza, silhouetting Arezzo's turrets, ochre, rose and natural stone, against the royal-blue sky. By 9 a.m., I have joined the locals and tourists in search of rare finds and bargains. The Arezzo antiques fair, Italy's oldest and largest, takes place the weekend that includes the first Sunday of each month, just 40 miles from Florence. With 500 sellers from Calabria to Campania, Padua to Pistoia, merchandise fills the piazza, climbs up the hill to the cathedral and spills down the side streets past the Chiesa di San Francesco, home to Piero della Francesca's masterwork frescoes, "The Legend of the True Cross." The jewel-toned frescoes are reason enough to visit Arezzo.

The announcement was scandalous. Just a year earlier, Lonely Planet had pulled out all the stops to praise these secluded beaches on Tasmania's east coast as among the 10 best destinations, and here we were, after a day of rest in Launceston, heading with a new group of hikers into the controversy, albeit on the recommended and less traveled route.

The premise isn't particularly fresh — womanizing contractor guy and his slacker crew more or less move in and make a mess while redoing the foundations of both the house and the homeowner — but NBC could certainly use a rehab. It won't be easy, especially opposite "Modern Family" on ABC.
"Part of it is you let a pitcher off the hook, he gets through a jam, he finds a rhythm," Matheny said. "We had a lot of chases on the breaking ball. He really slowed down the tempo, kept us off-balance all day."

The problem for Santorum is numbers. There are half as many bowling alleys in the United States as there were in the 1960s, and there has been a big drop in the number of bowling leagues. There are fewer stay-at-home moms, fewer big families and fewer men with jobs that don’t require a college education. Santorum does have a genuine affinity with working class, church-going guys in bowling shirts, but in Wisconsin that was not enough to win.

"True Grit" star Hailee Steinfeld became the face of Miu Miu last year at only 14 years old, but her first modeling campaign was cut short when the U.K.'s Advertising Standards Authority banned the photo.

She has since been replaced by "Alice in Wonderland's" Mia Wasikowska.

On top of everything else, the duke and duchess have fully entered the pop-culture pantheon: Mattel is selling Barbie-doll versions of them on their wedding day. Madame Tussauds has unveiled their wax effigies in London and New York.

Romney: Drop all tax rates by 20 percent, bringing the top rate, for example, down to 28 percent from 35 percent and the lowest rate to 8 percent instead of 10 percent. Curtail deductions, credits and exemptions for the wealthiest. Eliminate capital gains tax for families making below $200,000 and cut corporate tax to 25 percent from 35 percent.

Midfielder Ryan Pore set up the Timbers' first quality chance in the 22nd minute. Following a corner kick, Pore sent a cross into the box for defender Ross Smith. On his second touch, Smith put a shot on frame that was stopped by Gallardo for one of his four saves in the half.
Beginning Tuesday night, "Titanic" will return to theaters, this time in 3-D, in the U.S. and more than 100 other countries. In re-releasing his romantic disaster epic, Cameron is courting a broad audience of nostalgia-driven adults, fans who were too young to see "Titanic" on the big screen the first time around and moviegoers in countries such as China and Russia where theaters were few and far between during the film's initial run.
In the St. Louis area, the answers vary widely, depending on the district. There is no standardized way to identify gifted students. A child may be considered gifted in one district but not a neighboring one. The state recommends guidelines, such as minimum IQ scores, which can range from 125 to 132 or higher, but it depends on the district's discretion. Some districts also consider achievement test scores and creativity. Experts now think that individuals can have areas of exceptional strength, such as gifted-level mathematical reasoning or verbal ability. The long-standing measure of two standard deviations above the average IQ is not as good of an identifier of giftedness, Olszewski-Kubilius says.

Dear P.A.: On the premise that fashion reflects the times, I expected military looks last year as a reaction to the Arab revolutions and our own country's military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. So for me, the idea of epaulets and brass buttons was predictable. What surprised me was how inventive designers have been in adapting the theme in unexpected ways. Victoria Beckham, for example, offers a khaki sheath with epaulets and a heavy-duty belt. The surprise back is bare to the waistline except for crisscrossing straps that look like they came from a parachute.
The FBI had tapped Russo's phone and heard him discussing the raises with Romanini. But during his two interviews with the FBI in 2009 Romanini did not own up to having several friends and family members working at the auditor's office.

øDowney's playboy millionaire/scientist Tony Stark (Iron Man) verbally jousts with straight-arrow Steve Rogers (Captain America), whose earnestness is delivered pitch-perfectly by Evans. Not surprisingly, Downey gets the funniest lines. On another planet, he battles Hemsworth's Thor, who intones his stentorian dialogue with the superhero equivalent of a wink. Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk pulls off some of the best physical gags, making for a much more fun Hulk after the last few disappointing incarnations.

adequate. Not so when 12.7 million people are unemployed. The economy would have to grow about 4 percent for a year to lower unemployment another percentage point.
Architect Haralamb Georgescu (1908-77) designed dozens of buildings in Southern California, but he never gained the same level of fame as his midcentury contemporaries -- at least not here. Before he fled Communist rule in Romania and immigrated to the U.S. in 1947, Georgescu had a successful career in his native country; today many of his modernist buildings in Bucharest are landmarks, and the architect is considered one of Romania's most important. An exhibit last summer at the University of Architecture and Urbanism in Bucharest honored Georgescu and included a symposium on his work that included Wim de Wit, curator of architectural collections at the Getty Research Institute. An architecture museum under construction in Bucharest is to be co-named after Georgescu and Frank Lloyd Wright.
12:03 p.m. The pupusas — 5-inch-diameter corn pancakes with nearly pureed pork and queso filling — look heavy, with glistening highlights of oil from the frying pan. But no. They have a stout corn tortilla tone but lighter, bready texture. A crunchy, modestly seasoned slaw makes for a cool complement. The pupusas can be a satisfying meal in themselves.

Bel Air police report:
2. The Lakers need to show some effort. The main reason why the Lakers have lost so many double-digit leads, including two weeks ago against New Orleans, appears to have a lot to do with the team just going through the motions. Taking a short-cut approach has resulted in stagnant ball movement, isolation plays, little effort in boxing out on the glass and a failure to get back in transition. For all the struggles the Hornets have had in winning games, they've at least kept several of them close through nothing more glamorous than hard work.
CSU officials said the compensation packages for Garcia and Morishita are commensurate for the increased responsibilities they will have in their new jobs. They said competitive compensation packages are necessary to attract and retain the leaders of major universities.

2010 Precedent Ventana Vineyard Arroyo Seco Chenin Blanc ($18, 13.58%): Another side project label, this one from Nathan Kandler, assistant winemaker at Thomas Fogarty. This is small-production Chenin made from old vines in the Ventana site in Arroyo Seco.

But no one pays attention to what follows the underwater drama. The boy runs home to tell his parents about what he's seen, but they show no concern.

But that didn’t stop his Republican opponents from blasting the president as a weak ally to the Jewish state, although none called for a strategy all that different from Obama's assertion that Israel and the U.S. should use diplomacy with Iran if possible, but military force if necessary.

Sidewalks are bustling with pedestrians going about their business; there's more than 50 different kinds of cars, trucks and buses; and buildings are built to scale, complete with proper signage and back alleyways. The weather and time of day also will affect gameplay. For example, some missions may only be performed at night (and many missions are timed, too) while rain makes roads slippery, fog reduces visibility, and so forth.

On 9/11, America was shot in the back by 19 devout, praying Muslims, some of whom had infiltrated our nation posing as “students.” What the politically correct AP apparently sees as an “oppressed minority” is correctly viewed by the NYPD as a possible “suspect pool” for the next attempted terrorist attack.

Answer: They are because they're contrary. They sort of have a journey, and they have a difficult time. I mean, she's a disappointed woman, poor Jean. I think she thinks that going to India, you know, life will change, forgetting that you take yourself with you. If you're in a relationship that's not really working out and a marriage that's sort of finished, in a way, though neither of them will sort of face that, you're stuck with it, really. Her disappointment and her feeling of alienation becomes even worse. She doesn't even have any points of reference around her by the time she gets to India that she recognizes.

Lopez has actually been pretty delightful for years: 32 total, 17 of them at the current location in Cleveland Heights. It's a casually hip environment that glows with the vibrant colors of a Tijuana dance hall and the feeling that absolutely everyone, from a table of seniors to the romantic tattooed twosome in the corner, is having a good time. We hope local culinary legend and Lopez's new executive chef, Michael Herschman, is also feeling the love. He is solidly backed by Craig Sumers, Lopez's devoted owner. This bodes well. So does the chef's rethinking of the menu. Lopez's menu now reflects a balance of Herschman's seasonally based culinary musings, showcasing his penchant for bold, bright flavors, and some cheeky tweaks of Lopez's classic dishes. Most of the dishes come tumbling out of the kitchen in a riot of colors and flavors. His signature dish, sweet and spicy calamari, now has a heady kick of cumin and chile. The Ceviche Trio -- cool bits of raw tuna, sea scallops and lobster on a banana-lime salsa -- was a beautiful melange of tastes and textures. Lopez's grilled Charred Caesar is a garlicky-good classic; the addictive crispy-on the-outside-and-creamy-inside, anchovy-spiked cornmeal croutons were pure Herschman. He has also tweaked the Mezcal Chicken. It's now tequila-smoked, crispy-fried and crazy good, piled on top of pickled vegetables and a sweet cornmeal-crusted corn pudding. Rest easy, old Lopez fans. The Shrimp 'n' Grits are still around, pearly shrimp nestled in silken, buttery grits. It's the best of both Lopezes. You can try the cool new stuff but still indulge in the comfortable classics.-- Beth Segal, Special to The Plain Dealer
Noting that Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta have disputed the notion that torture produced information leading to bin Laden's whereabouts, the group Human Rights First suggests that the committee report will contradict Rodriguez's assertions. Perhaps so, although we would also note for the record that even if torture "worked" and helped the U.S. find bin Laden, that wouldn't justify waterboarding and other acts of cruelty.

Short stuff: I'm not saying American sports fans are apathetic about the NBA labor dispute, but here's the most common response I've heard since David Stern canceled games earlier this week: "Tim Tebow is starting!

Hmmm, not quite sure if Diehard would be the same if it were G-rated with Tebow glaring at the bad guy and saying, Yippee-Ki-Yay, Dooty head!" … Hey, did you see where President Obama had a beer with four unemployed workers while he was in Orlando earlier this week?

(On reflecting on the trade with Atlanta from last year and if he thinks about it a lot)- "I haven't thought about it a lot, but I do think it was the right thing for our football team. I really do. The guys we drafted last year turned out to be pretty good players, which helps that. If they weren't and everybody assumes we would have taken A.J. Green and that would have been the guy if we stayed, and I am not going to say 'yes or no' on that. This year, we hope to get some more good players. That's what the whole thing was. Somebody asked the question if it was time to not worry about gathering up picks and we think we are getting close to that point. I would say I wouldn't do that trade this year. I think we are further along than last year in terms of talent. Moving all the way down to that pick, it would be tough for me to do this year."

Of an entirely different nature, “Lady Almina and the Real Downton Abbey” is the true story of the family that inspired Fellowes’ series. Indeed, the character of Lady Cora Grantham (portrayed on TV by Elizabeth McGovern) was patterned on Almina de Rothschild, whose American industrialist father married her off to the earl of Carnarvon in one of those money-for-title transactions. The impoverished earl received a dowry large enough to maintain his ancestral home and fund his passion for archaeological digs, and young Almina acquired the title “lady” and the social status that went with it. Their home, Highclere Castle, is the setting for the “Downton Abbey” series.

The reason movies like that stand out is that they still make Hollywood nervous; as powerful as all these unhappy endings are, studios prefer a conventional kiss-and-fadeout.
