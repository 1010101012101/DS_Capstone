When 800 Degrees is a staple of every food court in America and the Pininfarina Coke machines have hit all the 7-Elevens, we will have forgotten this moment of wonderment, as we have those months when the first local Starbucks outlet really did serve the best espresso in town, but we really should enjoy this in the remaining few seconds before we all become jaded. This is a place with real Neapolitan pizza for six bucks; drinkable wine; cheap and delicious burrata salads; and an outer-space soda machine. It is vegan-friendly. It is open until 2 a.m. in Westwood Village, a famously difficult dining neighborhood.
Brady’s wiliness poses a threat.
Pommer had been on the receiving end of a pair of chances previously, but was unable to put the finishing touches on a nice pass from fellow striker Ashley Burton. Nevertheless, Pommer delivered.

Mushroom fritters ($9.75) have been on the menu from day one, and they're just as good today as they were 16 years ago: fat slices of portobellos deep fried and presented amid a tangle of arugula, shavings of Parmesan and crisp orbs of fried capers, with aioli for dipping.

Along with the score or so of tapas, there are a handful of entrees. The Hanger Steak ($27) with avocado and chimichuri was, as is typical, very flavorful and very chewy. The garlicky vinegar-based Latin American barbeque sauce was a perfect foil for the meat. Our waitress had warned us that the Seafood Cioppino ($35) was spicy. Fiery was more like it. Still, the spice hound at our table blazed merrily through the succulent clams, mussels and shrimp, the somewhat tough lobster tail and the spectacularly tender and sweet hockey puck-sized scallops, all bathed in a tomato-based (albeit incendiary) broth.

6 Marisa Haskell: Playing off native and Southwestern iconography and maintaining a minimalist edge, the Oakland jewelry designer transforms hammered brass chevrons and prongs, deer-hide fringe, faceted beads and Tibetan lapis into elegant, modern necklaces and wrapped bracelets. Her Laramie bolo and adjustable Oaxaca necklace take the beach-loving aesthetic that led Haskell to follow the waves to Mexico after her graduation from UC Berkeley, to another, luxurious level. Haskell describes her jewelry, which is sold locally at Erica Tanov stores, Reliquary and Metier as well as Saks Fifth Avenue and Free People, as lying "along the lines of modern bohemian crossed with a tougher rock 'n' roll" feel. 470-D 49th St., (510) 325-0019, www.marisahaskell.com.
"He pitched a good game. He pitched better than us," said Molina, the only hitter who faced Burnett in his last appearance against the Cardinals in 2005. "I thought he was going to use his fastball more. But he mixed it with a breaking ball, and his breaking ball was good."
Ohio State has been lucky in its draw this year. The Buckeyes were not in a loaded bracket containing North Carolina and Kentucky, as they were last season when they were the overall No. 1 seed. Cincinnati mud-wrestled ACC Tournament champion Florida State out early. Fab Melo's academic suspension removed the shot-blocker from Syracuse that enabled the Buckeyes to score inside in the East Regional final. Against Gonzaga, Kevin Pangos' pure-looking 3-pointer to tie a third-round game vs. OSU rattled in and out in the last 88 seconds.

Quinn has, however, dropped hints elsewhere.

"It was 175 yards and a 5 iron that I had to take a little off of, but I hit it exactly the way I wanted to hit it. I hit it just to the right of the flag, with a slight draw.

comedy has brought us many different ways to laugh. We have funny cat pictures (always fun), and even singer/songwriters. One such character that we have had the privilege of laughing with for years is "Weird Al" Yankovic.

And although the law tries to guard against racial profiling, what do supporters think will be the practical effect of a law that allows officers to detain people merely when they suspect that person may be in the country illegally?

Wornum's fellow member of the Black Team, Denise "Deni" Hill, gained even more -- she was up eight pounds, but called herself the "Biggest Winner" since she had deliberately gained weight to save her daughter, Sarah, from possible elimination.

Most professional organizations play cat-and-mouse games with the media over injuries. The Indians are no different. Is it smart? No. It just builds a distrust between the team and reporters. Then again a healthy distrust between the two is probably a good thing.

speak to Hungo's comments. I didn't hear them and haven't spoken to him about the topic. I do know that TLR controls any retaliatory response. Given his absence from last weekend's three-game series in Cincinnati, I would have been surprised if TLR had would have had bench coach Joe Pettini become central to such action. If someone is going to face discipline, I'm sure La Russa would feel a responsibility to take the hit. That, of course, pre-supposes that the Cardinals are intent on some sort of payback. TLR insisted he didn't think Cordero hit Pujols intentionally during Sunday's ninth inning. (And even if he did, the Reds never came to bat again.) I don't know if I agree with the term "bullied."

Still, you can stand with your back to the water and watch bicyclists glide down the bluffs on their way from Fisherman's Wharf to Crissy Field, few of whom pause to explore the gated compound on the right.

Not so long ago, Springsteen was in crisis. Not only had he lost two pillars of the E Street Band, but his 2009 "Working on a Dream" album had failed to catch the attention of uninitiated listeners or thrill the faithful. At 60, he was in danger of becoming something he'd never been before: an artist of interest to old fans only. Instead, he’s rallied, engaging with our current economic predicament on "Wrecking Ball" and crafting a tour that spins fears of his own obsolescence into a rocking, singalong lesson about mortality, aging, interpersonal responsibility and dialogue between generations. Every night, he makes a point of calling attention to the "new faces" in the audience. He's thrilled, and relieved, to have them there.

Because it does seem to work, and here's how: Zolpidem binds to what are known as benzodiazepine-GABA receptors, a class of chemical receptors in the brain that reduce cell activity. That makes many different parts of the brain downshift in terms of "excitability," and produces sedation. It is easier for people to initially fall asleep, and, for many, it may also assist in maintaining sleep throughout the night.
As we walked the corridors, in our white socks, blue bathrobes and slippers, pushing our IV stands before us, camaraderie developed. I realized it was the first time I'd had that feeling since Army infantry basic at Fort Jackson, S.C., during the Korean War, more than 40 years ago. There, too, we were thrown together by chance, black and white, in the 3rd Platoon, Company I, 8th Infantry. Our goal then, too, was simple survival, because it was clear that Sgt. Smith was going to kill us if we didn't shape up.

(Column Intermission: I am reminded of NFL contemporaries, quarterbacks Phil Simms and Dave Krieg. From 1979 to ’93, Simms played with the New York Giants; from 1980 to ’91, Krieg played with the Seattle Seahawks. Simms’ stats: 95-64 record, 199 touchdown passes, 157 interceptions, 55.4 completion percentage, 78.5 passer rating. Krieg’s stats: 70-49 record, 195 TDs, 148 interceptions, 58.6 completion percentage, 82.3 passer rating. Simms, of course, has Super Bowl glory and could be headed to the Pro Football Hall of Fame; Krieg, meanwhile, is sitting at this very moment in an Applebee’s. I wonder how things might be different if Simms played in Seattle and Krieg played in New York.)

As the Treasury prints money to pay its bills, the Fed could sell bonds to the public to keep the amount of money in circulation from rising.

There was the mishandled pitch from running back Kendall Hunter on a wide receiver end-around in the first quarter that he was able to recover.

Her fate, the mystery surrounding Anders and the future of the people around her become entangled as the book speeds to an exciting close. Patchett creates a compelling mystery, and yet Singh, despite her adapted appearance, remains a tourist, one who never learns the languages around her, who finds the Lakashi's phonetics too foreign to even learn their names. At some deeper, uncomfortable level, she remains an interloper, one with circumscribed empathy and little ability to treat the people of Brazil as individuals. Perhaps this is a larger statement about how Americans interact with the developing world. Or maybe it's because Singh, despite her best intentions, remains the agent of a pharmaceutical company.

Fifty-three years ago this spring, the state's titans of industry decided the time was right to bust Ohio's unions. Business leaders reached that dubious conclusion after an Ohio Chamber of Commerce poll showed 97 percent of its members favored a law prohibiting agreements between labor unions and employers making membership or payment of dues a condition of employment. What's more, 76 percent of the chamber members believed voters would approve passage of what is known as a right-to-work law.

They're strictly regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, and for most people they do offer an effective, cost-saving alternative to more expensive brand-name medications. Generics usually cost a third of the brand price because manufacturers don't have to earn back the expense of research and development. The active drug in both the brand-name version and the generic must be the same, and how it is delivered to where it's needed in the body — must be equivalent to the original.

"The Hunger Games," the teen action-adventure film that is opening to big numbers this weekend, is, without question, a parable of the Occupy Wall Street movement.

It is an experience far older than the L.A. riots -- and as relevant as the Trayvon Martin shooting. On the surface, perhaps, the two incidents have little in common: the then-27-year-old drunkard beaten so badly after a chase that his body and mind still bear the scars, and the unarmed 17-year-old boy killed by a neighborhood watchman who thought him suspicious.

Abreu, 38, apparently has no place to play with the Angels. He appeared in 108 games at DH last year, but with Kendry Morales on the mend after missing last year with a broken ankle, Abreu probably would get squeezed out of the lineup.

The second puzzler is in the casting. Laura Prepon plays Chelsea, but Handler herself -- in a brown wig -- plays her disapproving older sister.
