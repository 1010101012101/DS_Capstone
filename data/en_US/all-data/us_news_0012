Kasich is smart and, at times, engaging. More important, he has more guts than any Ohio governor in at least 60 years. And he's willing to move decisively and boldly to improve Ohio's dismal economy. That's why voters owe him lots more time before jumping to conclusions about his record.

† Said he would clinch the Republican nomination before the Tampa convention and took a swipe at Newt Gingrich and his SuperPac benefactor, billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson - though not by name. "Because of the way delegates are proportioned, it is a longer process this time around and because candidates get money from billionaires putting money into SuperPacs, candidates can last a lot longer. So it is a longer process but I believe we will get the 1,144 delegates we need before the convention," Romney said.

According to the memo outlining one possible scenario, the city's contribution would come from two city bureaus: The Bureau of Environmental Services, which oversees sewers, would provide up to $650,000 a year. The Bureau of Planning and Sustainability would provide the remaining $250,000 a year from a 15 percent increase on the per-ton fee charged to commercial haulers who pick up trash at businesses. However, the company would draw on the funds only as a last resort, McKinney said. "We're not asking the city to write a check," he said.

From Billboard: Blunderbuss' has elements of nearly every project he's worked on  even some of the 1950s bounce of the White-produced Wanda Jackson album on I'm Shakin' ' and Trash Tongue'  but also shows sides that the self-imposed, regimented simplicity of the White Stripes didn't allow. There are softer piano-driven songs (Love Interruption') and, at the opposite extreme, filthy guitar raunch (16 Saltines'), but also elaborate tracks reminiscent of late-'60s psychedelia, like the Zombies or Small Faces. Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy' in particular is unlike anything White's ever done, with a complex, hop-scotching melody and rhythm; similarly, I Guess I Should Go to Sleep' has a soaring vocal, a jazzy tempo and a violin solo. With a sound that's vintage and organic but also very clean, the album is so diverse that virtually every song comes as a surprise.

Hey, Michael: I also share your doubts about Griffin. His physical talents (throwing, running) are obvious. I don't like his size, however, or his inability to stay in the pocket and let pass routes develop. He is a smart player, however, and all indications are that he can learn the pro game. His physical attributes might get him on the field sooner than the typical rookie, but he will need superb coaching to develop.

In his strong Florida primary victory, Romney continued to court the most conservative elements in his own party to beat back Mr. Gingrich. A key question as the campaign moves past Nevada into Colorado, Minnesota, Missouri, Arizona and Michigan this month is whether Mr. Romney pivots to more general-election themes, targeting independents as well as the GOP faithful, who polls show still have reservations about him.

Mr. Romney is hardly the first Republican presidential aspirant to take that tack against a Democratic incumbent. In 1980, Ronald Reagan zeroed in on Jimmy Carter's competence.

When Apple launched the iPad two years ago, publishers saw two ways to balance Amazon.com's power: Enough readers would prefer Apple's shiny tablet over the Kindle to cut into Amazon's sales and the agency model would stabilize prices. Apple's iBookstore has yet to become a major force, but publishers believes the new price model has reduced Amazon's market share from around 90 percent to around 60 percent, with Barnes & Noble's Nook in second at 25 percent. The iBookstore is believed to have 10 percent to 15 percent.

A brief agreement with the Illinois State Police was derailed after a conflict arose because Hiram Grau, a high-ranking investigator under Alvarez, was named as head of the state police. Alvarez considered bringing in the FBI or a suburban police task force, but those ideas were rejected.

The law says there needs to be an "actual conflict," not just the appearance of one, he said, and in their view there was no conflict at all.

The game hamfistedly tries to evoke classic moments from the film, with secondary objectives such as buzzing a control tower with a flyby or snapping a photo of an enemy plane. It's clear the designers loved "Top Gun" as much as any fan, but the execution doesn't do the action classic justice. Aficionados will notice the details that carry over from the film, but the feeling is one of nostalgia for the film more than excitement to play the game. Maybe there will be a downloadable beach volleyball level at some point in the future.

I'm wondering what other people see in the city of Maplewood that they were able attract the BMW dealership there where the junk yard used to be, and now they're tearing all the homes and apartments down for the new Mini Cooper store. But yet they don't do anything about their eyesore buildings. The old Maplewood antique mall at Southwest and Manchester. They had a portion of the bricks fall down onto the sidewalk. Or the Stanfield apartment building at Lyndover and Bellevue. Neither one of those buildings has been painted for years. They're deteriorating, they're crooked, there's so much rotting wood. I just scratch my head. These people must not be doing their homework and looking around Maplewood as much as the rest of us do.
The move is a dramatic reversal for Amazon, which has fought hard across the country against being forced to collect state sales taxes.

Some conservative Christian groups objected. To enact the word of God in a commercial house rather than a sacred one was to profane it.

Hey, Tony: Last week, a reader posed a question as to whether Colt McCoy can be fairly assessed. You answered that he could, because a QB should be assessed by his individual skill-set -- "his arm, his ability to function in the pocket, his ability to see the field and read defenses, his ability to anticipate routes and place the ball where it needs to be." Now, I have no idea if Colt McCoy is the answer, and frankly I do not think he is. But outside the arm element, it seems that every other aspect of your skill-set of your evaluation directly correlates to the QB's grasp of the offense. How well one knows the offense allows him to anticipate routes, helps him to know what to look for in a defense, and the inability to do either of those things results in someone looking skittish in the pocket. I believe you also said Drew Brees had a "noodle-arm" when he was still on the Chargers -- so, who knows? -- Sam Toth, Cleveland Heights

But they started brainstorming, and after getting a commitment from Stone, who burst into the public eye in 2003 when she was 16, they continued down their list of potential collaborators.

But Anthony Mackie of “The Hurt Locker” is very good as the one almost-human controller.

King intentionally walked Lofton to load the bases. Vizquel, the former Mariner, hit a hard grounder to second. Rich Amaral made the stop, and flipped to Fermin, who was thinking double play. But a hard slide by Lofton prevented him from throwing to first as Kirby scored to tie the game, 3- 3.
Meanwhile, Republicans have drawn a line in the sand, at least when it comes to a seat on the Court of Appeals. Should the Republicans take back the White House in 2012, the Democrats will have little choice but to reciprocate with this new interpretation of "extraordinary circumstances." That will result in an increasingly short-staffed judiciary that lacks the services of highly qualified individuals who had the misfortune of ever having an opinion, or even an appearance of one.

In February, employee unions filed an ethics complaint against city officials including Mayor Chuck Reed and Retirement Services Director Russell Crosby alleging that they inflated the city's projected pension liability for fiscal year 2015-16 by $250 million to $650 million in order to force concessions from unions.

None of these men is particularly wealthy (even Atticus Finch, Esq., who is sometimes forced to accept produce in lieu of fees). Their battles are small, and their victories limited. By the end of their stories, George is still running a tiny building-and-loan, Atticus is a lawyer with a dead client and Lorenzo is back driving that city bus.
In many ways, the text had become my own experience of fleeing Nineveh, the legendary Assyrian city in the story. God calls Jonah to head there to proclaim judgment against the city. Jonah declines God's invitation, and instead takes a cruise to Tarshish, a seaport in the exact opposite direction of Nineveh. As everyone knows, this lands Jonah in a heap of trouble. God hurls a wind upon the sea, causing a storm that even turned crusty old sailors into a bunch of scaredey cats.

Davis says the double standard also extends to the $2 million bail set for Anna Gristina's felony in the third degree, the lowest felony level. She compares it unfavorably with bail for Jason Itzler, the self-proclaimed Pimp King, who's also currently under arrest for running a prostitution business.

As far as Jenkins, you know the book on him. Hes got all of the ability in the world and none of the off-field skills to handle playing in the NFL and making a ton of money. Personally, I dont have a problem with the Lions taking a chance on him. And he certainly fits the bill as the best PLAYER available at No. 23. But given the way that NFL execs value draft picks, particularly those in the first round  Jenkins to the Lions seems very unlikely.

The back story: Prana has been so consistently popular that it's hard to remember it was a restaurant, La Mezzanine, until 2001. Today it's Ybor City's only five-story nightclub. The first two floors (and the roof) are hip-hop and reggae; the third floor is Prana's "Sanctuary," a dark, chilled-out VIP lounge with an aquarium and more private bar; the fourth floor is a packed, sweaty dance hall.

The lottery, which Ohioans authorized in 1973, headquartered in Cleveland, has been a patronage nest for both parties.

One of Sapphire's greatest creations may be her own life, and her rejection of a life as a typical Army brat.

There are no rules about passengers having to fit into the economy-class seats. The closest the Federal Aviation Administration comes to addressing this issue is when it issues its guidance on passengers with disabilities, but it doesn't specifically classify a passenger's weight or size as a disability that is in need of protection. If it did, airlines would probably have to give every tall guy like me a first-class seat, which, now that I think about it, wouldn't be so bad.

Puts, the composer in question, seldom relaxes his grip on the listener. There is no emotion his writing cannot conjure. In the course of two hours he integrates an astonishing range of forms and styles: waltz and fugue, 18th century opera and 19th century song, a folk-like Scottish ditty (complete with bagpipes), atonality and more. At its best, as in the heartfelt choral lullaby of Act 1 or the shattering funeral march of Act 2, his music is as powerful as any being written today. "Silent Night" is, improbably, Puts' first opera; it shouldn't be his last.

This led me to the decision to let them pick their own dresses. I gave them a color, and have sent emails with images of dresses that are in line with what I envision. We’ve all agreed (and so far have kept up our promise) to be honest with each other about what each bridesmaid decides. When I get out of hand —I spent a week telling my Maid of Honor sister to find something white, which would clash horribly with my ivory dress — they gently tell me to consult a color wheel.

Fox's pictures were what you would expect in this day and age of 40-plus HD cameras and super slow motion. The network stayed away from most fan shots (hopefully ESPN took notice), replayed most penalties quickly, and was all over the biggest plays with multiple angles. There were a couple of times I didn't see a replay I wanted, but that happened far fewer times than it does during the regular season. One negative was Pam Oliver saying Donald Driver was questionable to return to the game when a picture showed him wearing a walking boot.

øWhat you're asking is a natural instinct. When you see others getting wealthy, it's completely understandable for you to want to join in and get a piece of the riches, too.

But before getting to that, I'll first provide the list of stocks you asked for.

Is everything too broad of an answer? You're almost doubling the amount of space for the same amount of people. You don't want to blast Candlestick for being an older building because there have been a lot of great moments there, but the new building is going to be a completely different experience. Instead of just making a nice hot dog, you can do 20 to 30 different items. It'll probably be a 50 percent quicker exit than what you see at Candlestick. You can't compete with that, being able to park easily and get to your car and out onto the freeway quicker or take public transit.

State exams in chemistry and physics, they argue, would push schools to require students to take these courses, when there aren't enough science teachers to educate them.

She writes poetically of old fencing and bailing wire, dogwood and mimosa trees, and ceiling fans that can’t seem to keep pace with the heat.
