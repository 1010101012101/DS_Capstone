But we pressed on and found many, many more things on the menu, mostly very good and all reasonably priced.
Nutt’s story, “The Wreck of the Lady Mary,” ran as a 20-page special section in November 2010. Nutt and videographer/graphic artist Andre Malok investigated the mysterious sinking of a fishing boat off the coast of New Jersey in 2009. The pair spent more than seven months reporting the project and, in addition to the newspaper stories, Malok produced a 24-minute documentary.
"The ultimate goal here is to get kids to graduate with what they need," said Forest Grove resident Hillary Frie. She said last year's cuts to foreign languages and other academics at the high school while keeping the football program intact was a public relations problem for the school district.
And so it must have seemed, a century ago, when the San Francisco quake became one of the first popularly photographed disasters. As SFMOMA assistant photography curator Corey Keller argues in his notes to the museum's show, "1906 Earthquake: A Disaster in Pictures," Kodak had introduced its first mass-produced Brownie cameras in 1900, at a cost that made them affordable and widely used. "For perhaps the first time in American history," writes Keller, "amateur photographers also played a significant role in documenting the
NEWARK — The body of a small, unidentified woman washed up along the Passaic River in Newark Monday, where police found it stuffed inside a suitcase.
"He has days like this where he sees the ball really good, and that was obviously the biggest at-bat of the game," O'Sullivan said of Pigott.
It's maddening because that amount of money could have paid the annual salaries of four Cleveland school teachers and maybe a classroom aide. But such cost calculations probably aren't best applied to this community nightmare.
That affair was, Elizabeth Edwards writes, a gut-wrenching addition to a life marked by tragedies sudden and inevitable, from the 1996 car-crash death of Wade, her oldest child, to the slow physical disintegration of her beloved parents; her discovery at a young age that her mother believed her father had had an affair, and -- finally -- the cancer that she has been battling since 2004 and that she expects will kill her.

Originally, only schools that were longtime top performers could win the award. In the No Child Left Behind era, though, a school can qualify if 40 percent of its students come from poor families and test scores are among the fastest-rising in its state. The program’s critics say federal officials rely too heavily on information that originates from the schools.
"These are very intense courses," she said. "Students are here several hours a day, five days a week. The courses can go from five to 10 weeks. When they leave, the graduates will be ready to work."

"I think what that was about last year was a group of guys who had been in the program, some for four years and others for two or three, just a lot of guys wanting to make a mark on the area and on school history," Columbia coach Shawn Hewitt said. "What it means to the school and the program is that it legitimizes the idea that teams from this area can carry some weight. It has been shown over the past several years that teams that come out of that sectional can compete with the top teams in the state."

So, fine: The report proudly notes that “for any given level of benefit,” a traditional pension plan will cost less than a private-style 401(k) plan, which offers no taxpayer guarantee. But that tells you nothing about whether New York needs to offer today’s “given level” of benefits -- or whether taxpayers can afford it, as pension costs suck up 20 percent of tax dollars.

Director Daniel Slater made mostly good, pro-drama choices, right until he put the skull-faced Fool into the Marie's murder scene; it would have been far more effective without him hanging around as a murder-urging Spectral Dude, or having the members of the chorus appear in skull makeup. It also wasn't clear why a boy and girl dressed as the Drum Major and Marie appeared among the tormenters of Marie's Child.
Stat of the day: The Indians, for the first time since the save became an official stat in 1969, had three different pitchers earn saves in a two-day span — Chris Perez, Nick Hagadone and Tony Sipp. Overall, it’s the 23rd time it has happened.

But he couldn't compete with Romney's juggernaut, and in Florida, the next big test, Romney and his backers outspent Gingrich, notably on relentless attack ads.

Opera Theatre of St. Louis has an international reputation, and a national and international audience for its annual festival season. The biggest share of attention this year is going to John Adams' "The Death of Klinghoffer," based on a true story of terrorism. The four-opera season opens with Mozart's funny-but-not-really-a-comedy "Don Giovanni," and includes the totally-a-comedy "The Daughter of the Regiment," by Donizetti and Debussy's mysterious "Pelleas and Melisande."

Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has overseen some $5 trillionin new debt. To help pay for it, he wants the rich -- the top 1 percent already contributes more in income taxes than does the bottom 90 percent -- to pay more for what he calls "the privilege of being an American." Geithner, whose department oversees theIRS, should have taken his own advice: As a rich American one-percenter, he once failed to pay his own self-employment taxes, and improperly claimed his children's camp costs as a dependent-care deduction.
It has never been easy to study any aspect of sexuality, let alone one so erotically center-stage as an orgasm.

This is not to say that individual elements aren't impeccable. Search long and hard and you won't find a more respectable failure. But the movie falls down in the two most important areas: It doesn't make the saga of its heroine compelling, emblematic or significant. And it makes being a geisha look no more interesting than working at Hooters. Indeed, imagine a film about a girl getting a job at Hooters, learning how to carry a tray and parry the customers' witty comments. Now imagine it set in a romantic past, in a far-off culture, and the various rivalries among the waitresses for who gets to wear the tightest T-shirt. The result wouldn't be all that different from "Memoirs of a Geisha."

Whatever the final model will be that Barron signs off on, there is this simple fact: the way FSU goes about its financial business these next few months will be drastically different. Certain recruiting trips may get scrapped. (The days may soon be gone when 7-foot-3 centers from overseas get brought to FSU). Raises could be frozen (FSU men's basketball coach Leonard Hamilton and his staff already have been told they will not be receiving the raises and contract extensions the school had begun negotiating for him in March, following his team's first-ever ACC Tournament championship and Round of 32 NCAA Tournament run). Long-distance road games could be shortened to trips closer to FSU's Southeastern home. Obviously, the forthcoming additions of Syracuse and Pittsburgh - sometime in the next two years - will have an impact on what types of non-conference trips the Seminoles take. (Even if rumors about FSU one day jumping to the Big 12 Conference are true, that could also cause problems for the school from a travel logistics standpoint)

Stuffed animals on a shelf above a child's bed aren't likely to be a problem, but the shelf itself could cause injury. Ditto a mobile over a crib. Safer decorating choices include a whimsical wallpaper border, a hand-painted scene or mural, or colorful decals on the walls.

Production for the new show started last spring, and Manzo has found it to be a refreshing change from her previous work on “Housewives,” a show that was “following my personal life and having me fight with people.” She also says the “My Big Fat Wedding” episode was dramatized. “That wedding, if you didn’t know it was put together,” she says. “We thought it would be good for my business and his, and it just turned out to be a circus.”

For Didion, this is the point of nonfiction, even (or especially) when it cuts so close. She hasn't published a novel since "The Last Thing He Wanted" in 1996; for some time, she made notes for another but set them aside after Dunne's death. "Nonfiction," she insists, "is more personal for me. It's more personal in that it's more direct, and actually it's always been more direct, even when I first started doing pieces. I could talk more directly in a nonfiction voice than I could in fiction." In any case, she adds, "I'm not sure I have the physical strength to undertake a novel," although in the next instant, she is remarking again on the difficulty of writing "Blue Nights," a theme she also raises in the book. "All I know now," she declares there, "is that writing … no longer comes easily to me" — a statement that echoes her admission in "Slouching Towards Bethlehem" "that there is always a point in the writing of a piece when I sit in a room literally papered with false starts and cannot put one word after another and imagine that I have suffered a small stroke." The more things change, in other words, the more they never do.

Ms. Zucker says she never thought of herself as overbearing, especially compared with her own mother, who is now deceased. Growing up, she wasn't allowed to ride her bike beyond the driveway. She remembers when, as a teenager, she wouldn't eat what her mom made for dinner, and then she would find it on her plate the next morning at breakfast. As an adult, she signed her first apartment lease without telling her mother because she was so fearful of her disapproval. "I really tried to be different than my mother," Ms. Zucker says. "But I guess that control-in-order-to-protect is ingrained in me."

I developed an interest in the Adams family in my elementary school classroom, where a set of biographies included one of Abigail Adams, John's wife. At Adams National Park, a ranger told how she creatively dealt with wartime economies and colonial conditions on her own while her husband worked as diplomat and statesman in Europe. At her request, he sent home the popular china of the day. When he returned, he discovered his creative wife had sold it for several times its cost to support their household with four children. Even when she and her husband moved as first residents into the White House for three months, she entertained in presidential style in the unfinished home, where she found half their china had arrived broken or was missing.
But that was before a congressman heckled a president, before guns were brought to presidential appearances, before a radio host called a college woman a "slut," before someone set a fire at the construction site of a Tennessee mosque, before "I want my country back" became a rallying cry. It was before there grew this gnawing sense that we do not know each other anymore, that the extremes are pulling the center apart.

The problem is the citizens who oppose illegal immigration do not trust the groups that push for acceptance of it, especially to put forth a good-faith effort to enforce any immigration laws that might result from "immigration reform." They don't believe that the forces that profit from illegal immigration, either politically or commercially, would honestly support border or workplace enforcement. Further, any such "reform" would simply be seen by them as an opportunity to widen the gates to millions more.
Builders broke ground on a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000 homes in November, a 9.3 percent jump from October, the government said Tuesday. It's the highest level since April 2010.

Bel-Ridge, a village of just over 3,000 residents, is known for strictly enforcing traffic laws along a short stretch of Natural Bridge Road and also for enforcement of housing codes. Late last year, its municipal court was in upheaval after a dispute over who would sit on the judge's bench. Earlier this month, St. Louis County police arrested 30 people while executing a search warrant at a home under operation as a "social club," acting on an insider tip that women danced naked, liquor was served, marijuana was sold and a child was present.

What does it mean that we can read as easily, as fluidly, on the screen as on the page? What does is mean that we can now take them both for granted, that it's not the form but the content with which we are concerned?
