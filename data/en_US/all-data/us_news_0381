Borrowing accelerated in 2009 as the recession took jobs and homes away from millions of workers who turned to their retirement accounts just to get by.

The rate had remained steady at around 22 or 23 percent through the mid-2000s.

Dear Margo: My adult daughters have many childhood issues. Their father was an alcoholic, and I was an enabler. My ex and I divorced when the girls were in their early 20s. Since then, my relationship with my daughters can go from quite loving to not being on speaking terms. They blame me for their unhappiness. The negativity toward me includes hurtful comments and ignoring me in public, and on occasion, the younger one attacks me on the phone for all the things she thinks I did wrong as a mother. My attempts to talk to them about their issues fail. They don't want to hear why I made the decisions I did. Occasionally, they get mad at one another, and then each of them is closer with me. When they are getting along, their common bond seems to be not wanting anything to do with me. The situation now is that we are not speaking. I've gone to counseling a few times, mostly to learn how to cope with this situation and to get a handle on my emotions. The sessions have helped, reminding me that my happiness doesn't depend on a good relationship with my daughters. The counselor strongly recommends family counseling. My daughters have ignored my requests to do this. I don't know how to fix this, and it's breaking my heart. — Tired of Crying

Outlook: Dolphins haven't drafted quarterback in first round since Dan Marino in 1983, and streak could end with selection of Texas A&M quarterback Tannehill. He was coached in college by Mike Sherman, Dolphins' new offensive coordinator. With many needs, also possible Dolphins will trade down in first round for multiple picks.

The group’s distinctive style betrayed the easy camaraderie between the three — they finished each others lines, riffed off of each others’ jokes, and gave the general impression of a gang of impish friends horsing around in the back of a speeding car. The language was raw, brash, and sometimes deliberately rudimentary. Theirs was a version hip-hop braggadocio that even a pre-teen with no exposure to inner-city culture could grasp.

If you are dealing with an investor who plans to re-sell your home, it is important that you disclose to your lender all facts that you know about your investor's plans.

Remember, when you ask your lender to approve a short sale, you and your Realtor are certifying that the price you have been offered is the best price possible in today's market. If you know your buyer has begun the process of re-sale at a higher price, your lender has a right to know. You and your Realtor are legally obligated to make full disclosure to your lender.

It is your option to have your Realtor hire the needed experts on your behalf, or you may contact them directly. If you wish, you can contact several firms and compare prices, services offered, and ask for references. It is important to ask lots of questions.

Also, the sales contract you sign with the seller has deadlines you agreed to meet. Therefore, it is important you make sure the service providers you hire can meet the deadlines in the contract. A low price for their service could cost you dearly if they can't perform their work in a timely fashion.

This image is part of my collection titled "6 Days on the Road," which started off as a weekend trip to Seaside for my brother's bachelor party. As we all loaded up and prepared to leave the beach house after a long weekend of doing what guys do, I got word that it was to break 100 degrees in Portland and stay that way throughout the week... No thanks! I'm unemployed, so I don't have a boss to answer to Monday morning; I'm single, so I don't have a woman to BOSS me around Monday morning; and to top it off, after all I've been through this last year, I REALLY needed a REAL vacation, starting Monday morning! So with my VW bus packed, my dog Wendy ready for the next adventure, I cruised on over to the grocery store and loaded up on some supplies to last me throughout the trip.

The 15th at Cypress is an architectural marvel. Playing all of 135 yards from the back tee, it is framed by bunkers, Cypress trees and an inlet of the Pacific Ocean.

It is an experience far older than the L.A. riots -- and as relevant as the shooting of Trayvon Martin. On the surface, perhaps, the two incidents have little in common: the then-27-year-old drunkard beaten so badly after a high-speed chase that his body and mind still bear the scars, and the unarmed 17-year-old boy shot to death by a neighborhood watchman who thought him suspicious because he was dawdling and looking around.

The city's first independent police auditor, Teresa Guerrero-Daley, reported in 1994 of complaints that officers were using the law to arrest people whose attitude they did not like.

“It has been on people’s radar on the federal level,” Slattery said. “Yet there seems to be no coordinated effort to make things better…I think it’s about making this a priority.”
But Csokas has a great, haunting quality as the mission’s leader, and Chastain — who in just a few short months has been the saintly mother of “Tree of Life” and the nice-but-trashy housewife of “The Help” — creates another great character as the young spy.

"Roy is a miracle," Garrett says. "He and I have this spiritual connection when we play. We kind of understand each other. When we played the music of Bud Powell with Chick, I remember watching Roy play. I was trying to figure out how I was going to play 'cause his beat was different. I literally stood on the side of the stage and watched him for a while. I kind of felt like it was a rope and I had to jump in someplace. As I stepped into the beat, I started to find another way to play. He doesn't play his high hat on 2 and 4 all the time. It's kind of, like, broken up. Ever since then, we've just had this thing. I just love to play with him."

I like to check-in on Foursquare. You can see which dishes people are recommending and maybe even bump into a fellow foodie friend.

Of course there is legitimate debate when it comes to what works and doesn't work in government. And many programs that are working for one portion of the population can have an adverse impact on another. But asking what is working is a better starting point than having the same, tired fight about the size of government during the next four years. (Hasn't that ship already sailed with the bailouts anyway?)
Arias knew he had to get to the highest point on the boat. He left the bridge and pulled himself up to the starboard railing.

On the side of the wheelhouse, Arias grabbed a life ring off its hook and handed it to Reyes.

I spent much of my day resisting efforts by those in the media to get me to make a statement. Today's events have nothing to do with me and no connection to me. Yet TV news crews started coming to my home seeking comments and my telephone rang nonstop with calls from those who were desperate to score the ugliest of political points off of this tragedy. Now my name is being mentioned in coverage and I have no choice but to respond.

Really, the Thunder is the only team out West good both at home and on the road (last night's loss at Washington notwithstanding). And none of this includes the defending NBA champion Dallas Mavericks (6-2 at home, 2-5 on the road), currently ninth in the standings.

I had a successful L1-L2 fusion some time ago using a bone graft from my hip. Now I need to have prostate surgery for BPH (Ugh!) and was told that I would need either general anesthesia or a spinal epidural. Does my previous spinal surgery preclude a spinal epidural?

Nor is Dream 2.0 "consistent with the best of Republican values," as Jacoby writes. Ronald Reagan believed that long-term residents of the U.S. deserved to become citizens, and he granted amnesty to nearly 3 million undocumented people. At various times, Republican Sens.

These humane efforts represent the best of Republican values, not a plan to create semi-Americans.

A year ago, the righty was frustrated that the team opted to leave him off the 40-man roster and expose him to the Rule 5 draft - but did so in the wake of health questions. Ottavino did not require surgery to correct a problem in his right shoulder, but the team publicly suggested that he would need it or that they were concerned that his injury would persist. That obviously made him unattractive to other teams even as it clouded his place in the organization. Though he was on the Class AAA rotation, he wasn't on the 40-man, and that can be a serious obstacle to a promotion. (See: Stavinoha, Nick.)

Industry insiders expect every major U.S. airline to take a look at AMR.

I know many individual Mormons and historic orthodox Christians who believe people in one another's communities to be genuine followers of Jesus Christ. But the religious movements of historic Christianity on the one hand and Mormonism on the other do not recognize one another's movements as Christian.

But it does mean that these religious traditions have things to say about one another.
