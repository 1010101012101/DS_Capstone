We and the Competition Commission are today, in fulfilment of our obligations, going to the aid of the other media groups in the UK, who areso bravely resisting this wicked and unprovoked attack on their services. We have a clear conscience. We have done all that any country could do to establish peace. The situation in which no word given to news International’s ruler could be trusted and no people or country could feel themselves safe has become intolerable.
Oh. And the photos were taken under the office florescent lights.
As of last month, I made some drastic changes in my “dating life” involving things as simple as making eye contact with guys to more demanding things such as joining an online dating service. I’ve also spent a considerable amount of time reading books on dating, from Christian and secular perspectives, trying to figure out how dating works, what’s the healthy process for dating.
This year, the fashionable royal continued the presentation of shamrocks and presented a basket of shamrocks to 40 members of the First Battalion Irish Guards after the military band began playing “God Save the Queen”. 450 soldiers in full ceremonial uniform participated in the annual St. Patrick’s Day parade, accompanied by the regimental mascot Conmeal, an Irish wolfhound who received his own sprig of shamrock from the Duchess.
Two weeks after adding the third drug she experienced a noticeable reduction in symptoms. I decided that I too wanted to take it, so I tried again at half-dose, with fewer problems than before. I went up to full dose after a week (roughly three months into treatment). About two weeks after adding the third drug, (Viread) I too experienced improvement.
Makes me question what else Claiborne will blow off with his new freedoms as a highly paid professional.
In concluding part 1, I have to wonder at the wisdom, (not to mention the authority(?)), behind allowing Occupy Portland Headquarters to be planted within an archdiocesan parish. This apparent lone action by Chapman seems problematic in other more serious areas as well—as in possible archdiocesan legal liability issues that may arise from future OWS/OP protest actions…

Quinoa (pronounced “keen-wah”) seems to be one of the hottest new food trends, increasingly showing up on restaurant menus, recipe sites and grocery shelves. But quinoa has actually been around for centuries and can be traced back to ancient Peru. An ancient crop that grows in poor soil, dry climates and mountain altitudes, quinoa is native to the Andes and also grows right here in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Yep, that’s right, quinoa grows right here in Colorado so it is another great option for CO Locavores.

I completed the layout with the fun and colorful banner stickers from the Field Notes sticker sheet. My layout was very colorful so I used a great black and white photo of my niece. I love the contrast between bright colors and black and white photos.
Ao dai makes a great keepsake for kids. I bought them at Ben Thanh Market, very well-known market in Saigon/Ho Chi Minh City that attracts a ton of tourists. I will have to have another post about my experience at the market. Just for your information, our Vietnamese friend said she got an “ao dai” for around $5, so I had that in my mind when I negotiated. The quality is not impressive (I already had to mend some), but for the price, I didn’t mind it.
I didn’t demonstrate the capacity to facilitate a close and loving relationship between the children and their father. No shit. Nevermind the father did nothing to facilitate a close and loving relationship between the children and their father. But, since Judge decided in January 2011, 15 months before the hearing on the divorce and custody in April 2012, there was insufficient evidence of domestic violence, everything I did from August 8, 2010 – April 9, 2012, to protect myself and my children was used against me in a court of law. Since there were no police reports, there was no abuse.
Now though the film as a whole builds a conflict between the wizard Jaffar and his two opponents Ahmad and Abu-- a conflict which leads to an overt combat-- the sultan's horse-riding sequence is subcombative. Once during the sequence the sultan fears that his mount may crash them into a tower, but the dominant mood is one in which the sultan is pleasuably overcome by the particular "might" of the horse, which is its power to fly. It would be no less possible for an isophenomenal film to picture a rider being enthralled by an ordinary horse's power to run, but clearly the affect would be different since the horse was merely doing something common to its species' nature. Here, the mechanical horse inspires the sense of wonder/sublimity in that it's doing something ordinary horses cannot. Going by the definition I provided above, the horse's energy is superior to that of the sultan, even though the two are not engaged in any form of combat; rather, the mechanical horse is displaying its fantastic power for the sultan's delectation.

At the end of it all El Rafa pulls out a piece of paper with my phone number and home address on it. He asks "Are these your numbers?" "Who gave this to you?" I demanded. El Rafa stares at me confused. "Ask him who gave him my numbers." I ordered the production assistant (by the way girls all the production assistants are really cute at Metro Radio 95.1!), they converse, "Guido. Guido is the guilty!" the PA replied. Guido I am going to wring your neck (I just couldn't do this to Guido, he is too sweet!)
I warned the company it would be reading about itself in print, which prompted an automated response letter: ‘Your complaint is important to us and will be fully investigated by one of our complaint handlers.’
Yep. It's pretty delicious (this is coming from the girl that doesn't really care for bbq sauce). It's also fairly simple to make; it's one of those wonderful set it and forget it type things. Also, it makes a lovely companion to things like pulled pork sandwiches (hint, hint).

Most home mowing accidents take place on steep hillsides. To avoid the possibility of accident, the best thing to do is terrace your hill or remove it all together by building a retaining wall.
I just recently started it. The save system is very PC-like. This is a good and a bad thing. It’s good because you’ll start exactly where you were standing when last saved. The problem comes up when you forget to save. Max Payne 2 doesn’t ever autosave or have checkpoints. I found this out the hard way. I died quickly where you meet with Mike the Cowboy and since I didn’t save I had to play from the beginning of the game back to that point…twice. Now I’m up to Part II, Chapter 3 and I’m saving any time I think I could easily die. Lesson learned.
Since the last brew, I've gotten the feedback from the Austin Zealot's Inquisition, the Alamo City Cerveza Fest, and the Dixie Cup in Houston. I entered various beers in each contest. I'm at least hitting a consistent "good" rating. But good doesn't win me ribbons. There are a few of the comments on the judged beers that keep coming back: fermentation temperature control and water quality. Some beers may have sanitation issues in bottling. I'm about ready to tackle those two items. First, I need to get rid of my second vehicle, a '72 Ford Bronco. I could just kick it out of the garage and put a cover on it. Then I can get a few more chest freezers with temperature controllers and go to town. I'd want one for fermentation, another for lagering, and maybe a third for storing bottled beers and kegs that are waiting for room in the kegerator.
Oh I did see my normal doctor this morning. She said that there is no inflammation around my gall bladder & that my gall stone is approximately 13mm wide. Due to it not be troublesome it can stay there until we figure out what is wrong with the rest of me.

To casual observation the illusion is undetectable but if someone examines it then they may make a Notice roll to realize that something is off. On a Raise they instantly realize they're looking at some sort of phantasm. Minor illusions are purely visual and cannot create sounds, vibrations, scents or a sensation of temperature.

Of course since I had to come up with something that most fifth graders felt very confident about and was still very fun, I chose SpongeBob SquarePants. This was a MUCH better choice than Parkour or Justin Bieber, I'll tell you.

“It’s Danforth. Shoot him.”
In my novel The Seducer I attempted to offer a psychologically accurate and in-depth sketch of three common forms of emotional insatiability: 1) the insatiable need for control and power over women of Michael, the psychopath; 2) the insatiable need for validation that keeps Karen, his needy and narcissistic fiancee, indefinitely caught in his clutches, and 3) the insatiable need for love of Ana, who represents the force, the need, the empty part that propels each and every victim into the arms of a dangerous social predator.
Many of these places will give you a certificate that the dog has been vaccinated against distemper in dogs, but be on the look out for discharge in the eyes, a fever and tiredness. Puppies get tired, sure they do, but thy are very inquisitive too, so if a dog seems happier to go to sleep than say hello, be wary.

To some extent, that concern is based on a misunderstanding I’ve addressed already. Just as contemplating a toaster oven may make you imitate a toaster oven, but it won’t make one magically appear on your kitchen counter, contemplating a global disaster won’t necessarily make global disaster more likely—though it’s fair to note that it may make you imitate the behavior that you believe is going to cause global disaster, if your contemplations focus on that behavior intensely enough. This last point is a real issue, not only in the peak oil scene, but all through the spectrum of movements that have risen in response to industrial society’s failure to deal with its dependence on the planet it plunders so recklessly: far too many people in these movements devote more attention to what they oppose than to what they value.
When we are in mourning, we wear black and while we (thankfully 'Petra isn't anyway) aren't in mourning at the moment, it is with great sadness that we see the world around us slowly turning into something we'd rather not see. So, it's only fair that we wear a little black
Basically I've added a feature (will appear at the bottom of each post) for linking to other posts about the weekly topic. Unlike weekly memes these links will not be discontinued after each week. I thought it would be interesting to start gathering some of our collective knowledge on the topics. Each virtue week I hope to collect additional links to add to the virtue library. If you wrote an appropriate post last week or last year please consider adding the link.
One of the best things we can do is practice the habits that lead to more happiness – like showing gratitude. When you feel happy and confident, you’re going to be able to take risks, and be able to try to learn new things and feel good about those experiences. And then allow yourself to share the love and gratitude you have with others.

Life’s order is characterized by emergent phenomena. These I define as the spontaneous development of self-organized order among ensembles that can neither be predicted nor explained by examining component parts in isolation. Spontaneity and self-organization mean that no external agent is sculpting the organism: it sculpts itself. Ensembles mean that an emergent system is composed of many parts. And for the component parts to self-organize, they must intercommunicate, interact, and cooperate. Life provides many interconnections: hormones, nerves, gap junctions, cytokines, and so forth. Thus understanding emergence requires studying the behavior of integrated networks. Reductionism cannot solve the secrets of emergence.

"but what *is it??*"
When I first started out job hunting as a teenager, there were no recruitment agencies in my town. Every job going was advertised in the jobcentre. A one stop shop as it were. It advertised every job available locally and also a few national vacancies. Advisers were also able to look for a particular job title in any other area.
This year, one of my New Year's resolutions (#2) is to learn to put in a zipper. How about you? Do you have a special craft or project that you use as your "go-to" when you want to give some one a "pick me up'? OR do you have any craft-related resolutions for 2012??
Anyway, it’s not as if she actually hates school. I know that when she screams in my face and is kicking and flailing at me that she hates school every morning that what she means is she hates the transition process no matter how gentle we try to make it. We have some good mornings, but statistically they’re the opposite of good. Especially after school vacations.

18. Us & Them (07:13)
Okay, I hadn’t intended to be so long-winded – but clarity is important to me. I’ll now conclude this sad tale, and sum up what I think about myself and the rest of humanity. To my knowledge, and actual experience, we represent the pinnacle of life in what we know of the universe. I have yet to see proof that there are any limitations to what we are capable of, except for those limitations we place on ourselves. And yet, we squander and belittle this capacity in an insane effort to escape the responsibility it represents. I believe the unconscious knowledge of this abdication is the reason behind the one consistent theme in all of the theories of life and morality I have come across: the notion that you get what you deserve. Now tell me, where do you think beings such as us are headed? What final judgment would YOU pass on mankind?

A closed heart chakra sets us up for isolation while an overly open heart chakra sets us up for taking on everyone else’s feelings, leaving us feeling overwhelmed, worn out and wanting to fix things so that we feel better. Pg 117 When we continue to intervene in others problems we deny them the opportunity to learn from experience. Sometimes the best way to help another and protect yourself is to just “…Walk away from them, sending them blessings and prayers on your way out.” Pg 118

For those of you that don’t know, VIB Status is a ‘Very Important Beauty’ Insider. You get this status when you hit $350 in an annual year. As a VIB you receive perks such as: first dibs on new products and pre-released samples, invites to exclusive store events and services, including a private holiday shopping party, exclusive promotions and freebies, including a VIB holiday gift card, a VIB-only hotline, and a 10% off next purchase coupon when you become a VIB. I have a feeling I won’t take advantage of the status very much, especially if this 10% off is the only real benefit you get. I’d be happier if it was 10% off every purchase, not just the first purchase after qualifying.

Here are a few things I did to make it look like a realistic basket---I cut the pattern using two different card stocks---cocoa and Kraft. By doing this, it enables you to see the weave design a bit more. And, I wanted to see it. I did try weaving a paper basket a few years ago and was so frustrated I tossed it when it was half done---so I am loving the ease of this.

Besides the fact that it had Johnny Depp.... (that never hurts!) .... I walked around for days remember that sad look on his face when he looked at Alice and said, "But you'll forget all about me." Do you think that perhaps there is a wonderland and we are all just playing in a different world?

My second option was feasible, but not practical given the time of day. Every once in a while, the smell of barbecue or grill smoke comes in on little cat feet into our abode from one of our neighborly neighbors. However, as it was 7:30 in the morning, I deemed it highly unlikely that the people over the high walls and electrified fence would be firing up the barbie to char something.
With the utmost certainty, that thought is struck down with a belief that this IS reality, not a dream state. I fly upward, taking in the rushing air to my flared nostrils.

Despite being a little worn out by my last Dan Brown experience, I figured my reading experience wouldn’t be complete if I didn’t read the last of his best-sellers. So, before my weekend of travelling, I picked up a few books, Digital Fortress being one of them.
Sam starts commenting on how the kid looks like Ms. Briggs and Carly turns the conversation to another topic, Ms. Briggs’ breasts. While this takes place, Freddie keeps recording.
We let her reach into the bowl to grab candy and she kept going for lollipops! I love her so much as a little ducky that I sort of want to dress her up in this again. What's an appropriate time/place to do this? Election day? Thanksgiving? Am I crazy?
Wild, huh? Now get this: I’m sitting there reading this stuff over tea, and I read that a fetish should have a fetish pot in which to live, so I go back to the store and get a fetish pot, and discover that they are covered with ground turquoise (blue!), and they come with a little food to sustain the fetish. Guess what the food is: a sprinkling of corn.

It's OK though because I know...!! A local artist was attempting to paint a couple of local ladies of a certain age wearing flower-filled hats and sitting outside the cigar factory. But you know what ladies of a certain age are like - they just wouldn't stop talking and waving their cigars about (our artist wasn't fond of tobacco fumes and she preferred her subjects to sit still and keep quiet). In the end she had to resort to a google image search to look for silent and stationary models. It's amazing what comes up when you search for 'old Cuban ladies smoking cigars'....

But weeds, weeds, I say, are my evil nemesis. And the weeds are mocking me! I drove to our friendly neighborhood everything store, browsed through the garden department, looked up and down for the weed and grass destroyer spray, read ingredients and compared prices. Everyone tells me Brand Off has the same ingredients as Up Round at lower prices. So I bought into their evil plot.
Proverbs 4:8 says that if we exalt and value wisdom, then wisdom will promote and bring honor to us. The use of honor here is the same as we learned in a previous blog; it means the weight of glory. Who is wisdom? Christ is wisdom. How, then, do we show that we exalt and value wisdom? This verse tells us how: we embrace wisdom. That is, we make room for Christ in promotion.
For those of you who haven't taken part before, or need a reminder, here are the rules:
Wow. I had no idea my little pointer to my reviews would generate a rant. I guess I'm feeling punchy.
But let me start by saying there is nothing more powerful than people sharing ideas when done right, the problem is that most meetings are what I call ‘Public Reading Scenarios’. That is people aggregating in the same room so that someone will read to them, something they could read in their own time, or more often the case, is totally irrelevant and no meeting is needed.
The trick is to document as much of this summer as I can. It helps me realize what a good summer I'm having without much vacation time.
Still none of those items turned up in her search of the pack. It was mostly just clothes and other random things that she was sure that would not come in handy while they were traveling. Why did they need all that stuff anyway? Oh, it was sleeprolls for the inside of the tents. Maybe those would be handy. And a blanket. It was rather chilly outside, even with it being fairly warm during the day.
Warning: the lighting is poor, her pajamas mismatched and the slip cover for our couch was in the laundry, but this is real life with 4 kids!
Lent to me is about love, my love for Jesus and the sacrifices He has made for me. I fast and think I'm so Christ like, I mean really fruits and vegetables people, ok I add rice, and some whole grains, alright nuts too. Practically starving for sure.

Jason and I went out for dinner last Saturday evening and used an Olive Garden gift card given to us for our anniversary. It was really nice. It can be tough for couples to reconnect after having a baby as it is. The grief of losing a child can strain a relationship to the breaking point for some. I am happy that Jason and I have been able to hold each other up through everything. I was blessed with a terrific husband and am glad that G-d led us to each other.

Because yesterday I was totally watching a trailer for The Ledge, which is a mainstream, respectable Hollywood movie and everything (we know it's respectable; it stars Patrick Wilson and Terrence Howard, and is described as 'a battle of philosophies' on IMDB) and is about somebody threatening to jump off've a building and somebody else trying to talk him out of jumping off've the building. This, coincidentally, is how Terrence Howard took the news of his sacking from Iron Man 2. I think it was a guilt-stricken Don Cheadle who talked him down.

The media have been backtracking in recent weeks over this point. Two months ago, those journalists who stuck their heads over the parapet were brazenly reflecting that the criticism of the manager which manifested at the Manchester United defeat in January, reflected the views of Arsenal supporters. Taken to task over such observations, this representation is now the manifestation of “some” Arsenal fans. As Arsène himself noted, “The dynamic is completely different“.
Alas the man was allowed to escape from the police-station. So medical personnel may have to plans on hold: they wanted to demonstrate Monday during the arrested black man's remand-appearance on Monday between 9:45am and 10:15am outside the Pretoria magistrate's court to protest against the brutality inflicted on the girl.
My husband is amazing...hence the reason why we're called Smitten Invitations. It's because I'm smitten with him...and not just for building me a lightbox to expose my own polymer plates!

Moral of the story … when you’re swapping and changing the people in your life, you’re bound to make mistakes, we all do, we all have done and we all will. In saying that though, it makes sense to look beneath the surface, look at the quality of the people you have in your life and ask yourself if what you want is really better than what you already have or does it just have that new smell we all love?

Well she is getting her 15 minutes sure. She reminds me a bit of the "ugly duckling" who is an anti porn crusader. You know the type. Mean, shrill, and just not real easy on the eyes. They are only in the anti porn business because well...no one much would be interested in seeing them in the nudie movies. Or so they think. This bothers them a little bit. This Fluke is in this "demanding birth control" business for much the same reason I betcha. In order to need birth control, well, there must be someone willing to do the evil deed with her (so to speak). Probably not a whole lot of fellas willing to go that far. At least while sober.

She is a little off on some of these. Chicken is not my favorite food, but we do eat a lot of it because it is healthy and versatile and Justin Bieber(JB) is not my favorite singer...he is hers. The rest are spot on. I do like green, I do love to run and shooting bad guy movies are my very fav!

Before I get to anything else, let me address one point first and foremost: what the hell is a cast like this doing in what is basically a kiddy-fied version of Rocky? Most of these people have been in some darned good projects before and since, why are they here?? All I can think is that producer Albert S. Ruddy was a great pitchman, trying to convince a cast like this to do a movie version of a book by Paul Gallico that must have started as an afterthought and ended up thoughtless.
Hope everyone is having a happy and healthy weekend!

I keep returning to the National Gas Corporation (NGC) Press Release of 4 February 2009 in response to widespread rumours that its heavy withdrawals had prompted the collapse of the CL Financial group. That Press Release rebutted those allegations, but was interesting in that it also spoke of CIB’s failure to return significant deposits in November and December 2008. This citation from the Press Release -

Finally we come to the defunct championships, the tertiary gold bars that went between stupid and oddly entertaining. Let’s begin with my favorite* one, that one that I still feel like Christian made: the European Championship. Maybe back during the Attitude era, when the world made sense*, this was a big title to have. Not because of the title, however, but because of who had held it. Owen Hart (RIP), Shane McMahon (could’ve been great), William Regal (the best Grand Slam with no name you’ve never known), amongst others, but RVD did with it what should have been done from the very start: he merged it with the Intercontinental Championship. In this PC society it would be wrong of me to indicate how weird it is for the smallest and arguably only non-continent to have a belt while other continents are left without one, but this is a PC society and I don’t want to do that*. Honest*. I don’t want to do it at all*.

RO 13:11 And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. 12 The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. 13 Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. 14 Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature.
The compression ratio of the engine is rv. Actually, this is a volume ratio. It is the ratio of the volume in a cylinder when the piston is at the bottom of the cylinder to the volume in the cylinder when the piston is at its top position: rv = Vbottom/Vtop.
It is a very different way of working: very much a team effort. My first draft – expanded from the editors’ outline – will always be altered, but then if I have some objection or quibble or a sudden idea, I know I can put it to the editors and that it will be considered very seriously, and more often than not worked in. It’s a bit like how I imagine it would be working for a US sitcom, or a British soap – the characters didn’t come from my head, but working together we can make them the best they can be, and keep them consistent and the story cohesive. It’s been tremendous fun working with Cassie, Ranjit and co. It’s not the same as my own work but I love it.
It’s interesting by contrast to consider the historical conditions that surrounded the evolution of the concept of hope in the ethical thought of the Western world. Like so much of postclassical Western culture, it emerged out of the creative collision between Greek philosophy and Christian religious ideas in the late Roman world. That was not an age of economic expansion and rising standards of living. Quite the contrary; as the Roman Empire ran up against its own limits to growth, and then drove itself into bankruptcy and collapse trying to defend borders defined in a more expansive age, economic crises and a soaring tax burden sent standards of living steadily downwards while the Empire lasted. Its fall in turn brought an age of chaos in which whole regions that had once known widespread literacy, busy market economies, and such amenities as central heating devolved into fragmented, impoverished and drastically underpopulated successor states in which eking out a bare subsistence was an achievement not everyone managed.

It has been a whirlwind week this week. Friday I thought I’d finally found some peace, but I was turned upside down when I had to leave a great workshop to return to work because my substitute teacher cancelled on me the night before. To further give me a spin, my day ended with a phonecall from my mom, telling me that a great uncle had died and the wake was — happening as we spoke.
I’ve always been drawn to the Latin culture. All the passionate and bright colors. I think of Dia de Los Muertos, guacamole, bright flowers, and Frida Khalo. Its no surprise my first Kids collection I designed was inspired by the culture. Check it out on the “Kids” page.

I know I wasn't born fat because I lived most of my life not worrying about my weight or ever letting my size bother me. Once puberty hit, I sprouted like a bamboo stalk allowing those baby rolls to finally stretch out, leaving behind only the wrinkled skin reminders. The issues I had to deal with were less of the too-fat-for-the-clearance-rack kind, and more of the too-tall-for-normal-people-size kind. My shorts and skirts were always too short for my long trunk and long legs and my shirts were never long enough or roomy enough to fully cover my long torso and discretely hide my ample boobs.

The formula is to.die.for. This is two coats, but that's only because I'm a habitual two-coater. It looked just like this at one coat. The formula is on the thicker side, but not in an annoying way, and it flows quite precisely on the nail. I barely had to clean up at all.

Adding the Premium package to your GDI account is simple and does a lot to help ensure you get the most out of your GDI membership. For starters, it increases your commission level. This is far too generous considering that with most other mlm and network marketing companies that I’ve come across you have to “earn” your way up to a higher commission level, as opposed to GDI Premium, which allows you to simply opt in to this higher pay grade. Most other companies will want you to first meet a recruiting criteria or achieve a volume quota in order to be bumped up to a higher commission scale. The same 5×5 network that equates to almost $4,000/mo with GDI basic all of a sudden becomes about $19,000/mo when all members of the network just opt in to get paid more. So that right there gives you an idea of how much additional potential is tied to the GDI Premium option.

They went on The Marathon Show shortly after the event and basically blamed the whole collapse of the corrals at the start of the half on “new and inexperienced runners” who “got antsy and jumped the gun, just pressing forward”. The reason they ran out of water/cups at later aid stations? The volunteers were cold and abandoned their stations. The medals? Oh, they knew going in that they were short (did I mention they were still registering people at the expo, already knowing they were short on medals?) but did and said nothing. The water? “It was hydrant water, but it’s tested.” They took very little responsibility for anything.

Archeologist Eli Shukrun commented, “The name Matanyahu, like the name Netanyahu, means ‘gift to G-d.’ These names are mentioned several times in Scripture.

I appreciate that there's a great deal of what I think must be authentic male view point because, at first, it tended to leave me confused. But as I delved more into the various minds involved, it started to make it's own twisted (i.e. male) sense. It involved a passionate seme (I hate semes that seem untouched or are cold to their partners). It involved a strong uke, and I appreciate that just like I appreciate a strong female protagonist. (For those unfamiliar with the terms, a seme is the one penetrating. I presume you can deduce what a uke is.) There are no love interests here that look like grade schoolers. No blushing ineffective ukes ready to cry at a moments notice. Everyone has their own personality and their own strengths, without any of them being perfect or making optimum choices. And that fits in pretty well with kids about to graduate high school as well.
Check out your local book shop and library and get to know the current market. You’d be amazed how many people still send in manuscripts to publishers with covering letters explaining they’ve written in the style of Enid Blyton or Arthur Ransome. The chances are, the agent/publisher won’t take more than a cursory glance at your precious manuscript after that. You need to know what’s been done recently, how well it’s been done, what appeals and why. THEN you can start to write. Also bear in mind that writing is a craft and needs practising. And it’s hard work as well as fun.

I remember bringing it with me on a tape when I went to New Orleans in January 1992. Was a very cold week I spent there. The hotel room was freezing cold most of the time. The TV hardly worked at all and across the street there was a housing project. Om the sidewalks there were often groups of teens walking by. Some I could see were armed with pistols. I was often scared to walk to and from my hotel to the center of the French Quarter. Always feared to be robbed or worse but I was lucky. Nothing happened. However it was an odd sight to see snow in the streets some mornings. Even if it melted away very quickly. Ok, I’m digressing but sometimes the memories just come back in force.
Anyway, I am going to get off my high horse now… I don’t know why I felt like ranting. So sorry guys! Ooops.

In contrast, schooled individuals, when they "fail" (again, the quotation marks are important), it's because they're too unmotivated/stupid/whatever: it's NEVER the fault of schooling. And when a schooled individual accomplishes something impressive, it's because of the wonderful education they received at school, never in spite of school, or because of their own inherent wonderfulness.
I walked back into the kitchen and turned on the radio to play Bob Marley’s “Don’t worry, Be happy”. My mom loved that song. She used to sing it when I would squish things and she cleaned up the mess. I like the smell of bleach in warm water. It is almost cozy. My dad use to drink bleach. He does cocaine now. Last week I sent him some cash so he could buy some. He gets really sick when he doesn’t have any and I promised my mom I wouldn’t let him hurt himself. I looked at the clock on the stove top. The little green numbers said 2:45. Quickly, I walked into the living room and sat in the pink chair that used to sit in my mom’s living room. I picked up my cell phone and said “Hi mom!” I smiled. I like my mom. She is dead but she still finds time to call. “Uh huh…Yes mom, I am feeling happy today. Everyone in Sunnyville is happy.”
So loudly, my sorrow cried, into the sky so blue
It is pretty obvious that all the numbers dealing with the so called recovery and the American economy is nothing more than manipulated propaganda. I see it everyday on my commute to and from work. I see it everyday in the feeble attempts of projects pushed out by the company I work for capitalizing on nothing more than targets of opportunity for quick cash. The solid over spending schools that were counted on for millions before are just not buying over priced materials like they used to. Hell... They aren't buying em at all now because the bankruptcy agreements and state take overs won't let them. The traffic during normal business flow times just isn't there either. LIES I tell you.
But perhaps the main reason I supplement, in addition to those mentioned above, is that paleolithic humans did not evolve to maximize longevity, such as living into one’s 90s. (Their lives were so perilous that they rarely lived to be 40.) Over the years, many things break down in our bodies and don’t work as efficiently as when we’re young, and it’s accurate to say that this process is “natural”… except that we’ve made it worse with an unavoidable daily attack from environmental toxins. And so here, at least, is one instance where I’m more than happy to deviate from nature’s plan and use some nutritional science and technology to reach my goal of becoming a centenarian. In fact, I’m philosophically closer to being in the camp of Ray Kurzweilian (of “Singularity” and life extension fame). He takes hundreds of pills a day. Actually, I only take between 0-25 pills a day (sometimes more if I’m taking a lot of chlorella tablets), of up to 15 kinds, depending on what’s going on in my life. My husband does as well; a different set of supplements unique to his situation.

My little nephew Jace had his third birthday. His room is a toy store already so I got him art supplies. I went over on Saturday and we colored and cut and glued for over an hour. He even made a scrapbook page in his pad of paper. Julie scrapbooks and he likes to be in the room with her so he thinks it is a great ides. Now the big boy can do it too. I also sewed up a quick Superman cape...He loves it. He likes to fly.....

Once inside the apartment, Evelyn was mesmerized by what she saw. There was a plush, red velvet swing in the middle of his living room! She squealed with delight as he pushed her in it. And then he offered her champagne! Her mother never let her drink! After an hour or so, she began to feel woozy. Stanford forced himself on her and raped her. Afterwards, she sobbed, ashamed at her foolishness for trusting him.
Windwalker was pretty fun considering the rotation is not yet finished. It’s a bit mindless — use rising sun kick and fists of fury on CD, then just bash whichever button is glowing — but it’s fast, and slaying dragons with your bare fists is pretty cool. It didn’t really feel like a new class, though. More like a slightly different rogue.
Set aside eggs in medium mixing bowl. First, get or mise en place together. Give the mushrooms a good rinse, but be careful since mushrooms suck up a lot of water.

You can tell from this series of images that the person photographing the children is quite obviously a loved one. The photographs expose their relationship as mother and child, a stranger would simply not be able to take such intimate photographs nor would they have the consent to do so in some cases. Mann’s close relationship with her children and their relationship with each other has allowed these photographs to be taken. Mann has combined her love of photography and her love of her children and been able to produce a series of beautiful photographs that reflect this.
In the following piece of poetry, the spirit of Narcissus is reborn as the knight Aaron who is blindly in love with the most beautiful Lady of his times, Andromeda, unaware of the fact that her own best friend and companion Abigail,Echo incarnate, loves him with an unflinching love in life and death.On his insistence, Abigail arranges for his meeting with Lady Andromeda, dying a death in every single breath and moment while she does that.Andromeda, on the other hand, despises the knight on account of the fact that she knows that he loves her and it sickens her that he does so even though he is aware that Andromeda gives not a hoot to him.On this fateful night Aaron comes to her castle, she is possessed by Nemesis, the Goddess of Revenge and her hate for the knight intensifies multiple times.Heres the account of what follows :

Of course I do not expect everyone to subscribe to these ideas but they have arrived after considerable research and personal experience. When it comes to hobbies for me, poetry has always been there, since childhood. I have never considered “poet” as career. Taking a break from radio, at this time, was not coincidental for me. My “mentors” had just started me on a very intensive new set of energy exercises and the result was quite dramatic. This break has allowed me to write 7 or 8 truly incredibly complex poems. It has been – and continues to be – a truly incredible experience when I am “urged” to perform this exercise and then sit down behind my computer. There is a great deal of evident wisdom in them but even more that is “encoded” so to speak.

The cover photograph, another one of ECM’s lovely photos taken from a moving vehicle, shows a bicyclist in the rain, while jacket photos show children at play (predictably in black and white). This sort of uninhibited joy and enjoyment – even the cover’s necessity of getting somewhere despite the means and the prevailing conditions, perfectly illustrating the album’s “rruga” – isn’t really felt in the music.
There are so many songs out there. Like, lots of songs.
After a few days off, we had another session with Bonbon in the school. Starting with a lunge session - she's actually offering the trot now, and is much calmer. We now have to try and get some softness and relaxation in the trot. We followed that with a ridden session of the usual walk/halt transitions, with small circles and changes of rein. She's settling to it all so well.

Ultimately, what it all comes down to is the ability to engage the players in a dialogue about their actions in game, and their reactions out of game. It means being able to gauge everyone attention span for the evening and (going back to flexibility!) playing down the creepy ambiance in favor of simple descriptions and head-bashing combat. Or playing UP the ambiance and dialing back the combat! Or dropping extra hints about where to find the next clue, or having the cute tavern owner make googly eyes at the character who’s been quiet all night and might need some attention, or realizing that no-one is interested in your scenario about rival gangs in the town they just came to for supplies. But they ARE interested in finding out why the local temple has closed its doors to the public!

And, in wildly optimistic theory, if I keep your attention long enough, and get the word to enough people with as good taste as you, (that’s a lovely blouse you’re wearing, by the way), and learn how online advertising works, (for that matter, how on earth does ordinary advertising work? Did I ever buy Holsten beer, or travel with Thomas Cook, or invest with Investec due to their sponsorship of my beloved Tottenham Hotspur Football Club? Well, actually, I did end up investing with Investec recently, but that was pure coincidence…), then at some point in the future maybe I can get paid for sitting around and reading, and writing about what I have sat around and read, and that would be about the most ideal outcome for any fantasy job I could imagine.

Post-Baby:
Marxists do have a problem when it comes to such questions, because although we talk about class analysis, and class struggle, and class politics as central, there is no precise Marxist definition of class. Marx began writing such a definition in Capital, but found that it led him round in circles, and so he abandoned the task leaving just a fragment of that work to appear. In reality, the very basis of the Marxist method means that no such definition of class is possible, because that method is based upon historical specificity. Marx's analysis of class cannot be summed up as “You are working class if X, you are Middle Class if Y,” and so on. Engels sums up the Marxist approach to class in his Letter to Bloch, where he writes,
For one thing, the frequent stock footage of Collinswood outside at night and day looks just like the outline of Tegel Manor! And the interiors of Collinswood and the dilapidated old house next door practically screams “Tegel!” Even Barnabas’ speech early on describing the creation of Collinswood from local lumber and imported stone seems to be a description of the building of the great house of Tegel. This is super inspiring stuff for Tegel adventuring.

I can search my entire Out of class assessments folder for a particular objective (be careful to make sure to select that folder since it seems to default to “This Mac” each time and you initially get noisy results—as long as you stay in the search mode, though, it will keep searching just that folder, so you only have to change that once each session). Since each test has that checklist/grading sheet right inside of it, and since the computer searches the contents of my files, I can quickly see every test that contains, for example, objective 9.4 (which, for me, happens to be 9.4 B CFPM I can use the conservation of energy to calculate the escape velocity for an object.).

In this scenario, the consumers are highly aware of the task they have and are actively looking out for solutions to fulfill it. But the ability of the product to accomplish the task may not be evident right away. Marketing is therefore vital to bridge that gap of understanding. A story needs to be told about how the product acts and delivers impact on people’s life.
My favorite recipe, though, was for a cabernet poached pear.
We need support and family to help us along the way. We as well know that the best success is self discipline. We can agree with all this, however at the same time it's reasonable to remind you of something more significant than all those things taken together - your health.
Evidently, this is a pretty common side effect of anesthesia, not to mention relatively short lived. Now, trying to pin down a precise answer from doctors is like trying to herd cats, but we managed to wrangle out a rough time frame. These symptoms should subside in the next 1-3 days, and, until then, we need only to be more conservative regarding the speed with which we feed him. As long as we do that, we (read: Sam!) should be fine. So, in short, they let us go...as of half an hour ago, we're home! Hooray!
Possibly long overdue for a DVD release is the first season adventure, “The Sensorites.” “Long overdue” because the titular alien race were the influence for the prominently featured new series race, the Ood; “Possibly” because the Sensorites aren’t particularly fascinating figures, and Ood fanatics (surely you exist?) dying to get a peek at the mysterious species’ origins, are likely to come away wondering how the Sensorites were the inspiration for anything.
Lately my toddler, C has been getting in on the action. If she is not napping whilst we do school, she wants to be up and in the action. Thank God for "spare worksheets" she thinks she is doing school too. Which she is really. She also loves using the flash cards and pointing at the pictures and trying to say new words. I have noticed she can say some sounds, "a", "b", she is starting to count "1", "2", "3", she loves to colour and draw and I see she is starting to hold the pencil correctly already.
After being delightfully surprised with this dish, I followed Neal's recommendation and ordered the chicken. Three of us ordered the chicken. And we all LOVED it. Although I didn't get some more pics of the food, this was the general consensus of the rest of the meal (got to get better with taking pics using the camera phone if I am going to document the journey more appropriately. Or charge the battery in my camera). The skin on the chicken was pan seared giving it a nice crunchy exterior but the breast and the thigh were so moist and succulent. A winner indeed. A couple of my friends ordered the veggie plate and fell in complete adoration, proclaiming it to be one of the best veggie plates they had had (and one is a vegetarian so that's big).
This afternoon, after swimming, I read for about an hour, then watched about 90 minutes of TV. My stomach was growling. I drank about five cups of water over that time, but got to the end and was still feeling hungry. Not for anything specific, but for food.

On May 29, 1983, Motley Crue performed at the music festival as well and they too were brought to meet me in early June.
The real attack, however, was yet to come -- and no surprise, from Charlie Murphy. Although Mitchel had continued with his vow to eradicate police corruption, an educational reform policy was viciously attacked from both ends, from Murphy's Tammany pawns and from William Randolph Hearst's New York World. The attacks worked; Mitchel, a Catholic, lost the support of the poor Irish Catholics who believed the education reforms would only benefit the rich. By the end of his term, the Boy Mayor was soundly defeated by John Francis Hylan -- bringing Tammany back to City Hall.

I cut out a new bear doll (the svg can be found in the SVG Library in the left column of this blog), and then I used some scraps of red, black and white to make his outfit. I didn't cut the holly and berries for his hat, but the svg is part of the file for rhose, too. :)
Typically the nearer to sunset the longer the ISS will be visible, approx. an hour to 1.5 hours after sunset you’ll get a very bright pass almost from the western horizon to the east later in the night, it’ll disappear into the earth shadow quicker.
Why luggage tags? Well, these people who travel to different countries love them because a) they are original and you won't see them often. So, you can find these easier in a crowded airport. Another reason, b) you can color code your luggage! One color is medical supplies, one color is your son's, one is yours, and another color maybe your father's, etc. This way, you don't have to go through every single suitcase to figure out what is where!
You've seen these jeans before, but I haven't properly introduced them: they are my first-ever pair of designer jeans, and by 'designer' I mean jeans that cost more than 200 bucks. Let me clear up something right away; I would never pay $200 for a pair of jeans, let alone more than that. Jeans are one of those things that I have a definite price cap on, and the absolute upper limit is $150. I found these at Gilt Groupe for just over $100, which is the only reason I even considered them in the first place.
Though Polanski never explicitly acknowledges it, there is temptation for Walker to forget his wife and go for Michelle instead. One reason could be the possibility that Walker’s wife might not have been kidnapped at all but may, instead, have been whisked away by a lover somewhere in Paris. Walker refuses to accept this as truth, although it makes for a helpful alibi after he begins fending off curious bystanders. To get the police off his case, he tells them that Michelle is his mistress. To rescue Michelle when she is beaten by angry thugs, he sneaks into her apartment from the rooftop skylights, slips into her bedroom, strips naked, makes himself visible and then valiantly assaults her tormentors: “Don’t mess with me, man! I am an American, and I AM CRAZY!” Most hilariously, when Walker is stopped by his old colleague, Peter (David Huddleston, aka Jeff Lebowski), at the airport (with Michelle in company), Peter grins at Walker’s “mixed with the bags” excuse—while Edie (Alexandra Stewart), a friend of Sondra’s, sneers that maybe she’ll “see any new faces in HER life.” The scene is a pointed demonstration of the different ways in which males and females react to extramarital affairs, not to mention how they tend to simply regard them without actually acknowledging them.
Hailing from London and led by the infamous Lee Dorrion (Napalm Death, Teeth of the Lions Rule the Divine), their roots are all over the place making it possible to further stretch their fist-ended limbs and make a truly interesting record. The first notable track, “Casket Chasers”, reminds the listener of long-lost Acid Bath in a few instances. The pure rock groove and vocal effects may startle some into thinking that it will go into suck territory at any moment. Luckily, that moment doesn’t happen until way later in the album. This, pure and simple, is windows-down, beer can between the legs while driving rock. Quality overcomes the potential boredom of such a genre so without fear in head all can have fun.
2. Why did you decide to do this instead of other independent consulting opportunities? I decided to become a Pampered Chef consultant because I found that going from a two income family to a one income family our priorities changed. We couldn’t afford to eat out as much as we once did and now I actually had the time to cook. But I didn’t know how, so I would research the easiest recipes for our favorite meals. I wanted to be able to do the same for other people, to take the time to educate on how to make tasty meals in the least amount of time.
By this stage, Simon is treating us like old friends, just like he seems to have-a-chat with so many other patrons in the place. There's an obvious camaraderie between everyone on staff, who all look genuinely happy to be there. Even on a Monday night, Freda's is eventually packed out, filled with a mix of uni students or local residents.
What Richie and Frank have in common is that they are both unbelievably determined and stubborn when set on a course. Neither has much use for the counsel of others either. Both are supremely confident in their own version of the world. In this case, that's exactly what's required to bring down Frank, as a good cop without Richie's stubborn streak would likely have given up long before getting close. Both men also play their cards close to the vest. Richie doesn't give us any exposition to explain why he is how he is. The only hint we get from Frank about his own ruthlessness is his story about cops brutalizing his cousin, and even that is only given in hopes of intimidating Richie. Neither man has much use for playing victim.

The client wanted yet another proposal with more detail. We may not have got it, we were one of four companies presenting. But I talked to the guy I was teaming up with and we looked at the consequence of winning it. Insane program, crazy tight budget, big risks. Plus we are both independent consultants who have young families. The cost to our spouses and children was also too high. So we took a deep breath, gathered all our courage and said no thank you.
Hello everyone! Here is a card with matching envelope that I made. I learned a new trick and I will share it with you!
It was one of the hottest days of the trip and we literally felt like we were in an oven as we stepped out of the car to check out ticket prices. We didn’t do much research and I was surprised when I found that we had to pay a pretty steep ticket price and then be shuttled to the home itself. It all makes sense now as I look back; with millions of visitors year in and year out, its a tourist mecca and needs to be kept as closed off to prying hands as possible. I was a bit skeptical about paying the price but Dad said “Hey, we’re already here. When else are we going to do something like this?” A smart man.
Who designed these things? I suppose they meant well, but seriously, low-water-use front-loaders require multiple cycles to get clothes clean and soap-free, and longer dryer cycles to get things dry. Not very energy- or water-efficient. On top of that, the ultra-fast spin cycle presses wrinkles into the clothes--wrinkles that don't relax in the dryer.
How was I supposed to figure out how to make a quilt? I decided to do what any other great mind would do…..look on youtube. Lol! I watched so many videos, I don’t know “who” is responsible for teaching me “what”. The next thing I know, I’m searching the house for materials to complete this project. You know my motto, “use watcha got”. I meant to say it just like that.
This is interesting in the context of my last entry:Born in ..., X came from a poor family, his father being a railway clerk. An exceptional intelligence enabled him to rise quickly in the officer ranks of the ... army. He joined the counter-espionage service and rose to become its chief. During his tenure in office he greatly improved the methods used by the ... counter-espionage service. But at the same time he himself was a spy for ..., ...'s enemy, and his exposure was largely due to the improvements he had developed himself.

Yes LOVE with all caps! It is wonderful and I am thankful everyday that life has turned out this way. I would like to thank my previous job for letting me go. Because while it was not good at the time and I was very sad and upset about it, this change has been the best thing for my family and I believe it will keep getting better and better.
Another positive side effect of all this bamboo guzzling: panda poop smells great.
I felt that old lurch, that gravitational pull, that desire to inhabit him- like wherever he was in this world, I would know where to find him, and I would do it. I would find him and take him home.

Gordon’s 19th-century character is not based on any specific person, but is rather a figure of marginalized history, which remains center of his narrative fascination. Gordon teamed with artist and historian Forrest Holsapple and went on frequent trips to Vermont over a period of time that had the team tracking the landscape Gordon was portraying in the work. Hols apple’s photographic work and photo manipulations of period photography will be used in the performance — the Mass MoCA show represents their debut on stage.
“When a religious group objected to having a certain license tag on their cars, it went to the Supreme Court,” Gowdy said, in an apparent reference to the 1976 case of Wooley v. Maynard. “Do you know who won?”

Sure enough, as the day went on, I didn’t even notice one person who looked at my legs or said something about them. I specifically wore shorts to highlight that they were shaved, too. It took a surprisingly long time to shave them, but I suppose if you’ve never done it before and it’s long that it won’t take a short while. At the end of the day I took pictures and posted them on my Facebook account to see many of my girlfriends comment approvingly. No guys really commented, which sort of surprised me. I half-expected some sort of homophobic statement from at least one guy and didn’t get it. Perhaps they didn’t notice the photo album.

I am 25 years old and have only recently started becoming interested in the world of fashion. Growing up as a tomboy, I just threw on whatever I could run around in and play comfortably. I grew up playing outside in creeks and trees, not exactly the best place for a dress and high heels. From there I went on to become a dancer; again I dressed for comfort, not style. What was easiest to move in? While in high school it was easiest to throw on sweat pants and a hoodie when waking up at 6 o’clock every morning. I didn’t want to brush my hair, much less put together a great coordinating outfit. Now I am in college and still find it easiest to just throw on a pair of sweat pants but I am trying to change that attitude. I am realizing how great fashion is, how you can express yourself based on what you’re wearing and how changing your accessories can make you stand out from the crowd. But I still have a ways to go. My closet is still more hoodies and t-shirts than Chanel and Versace. But let’s see if I can change that. Let’s see how far I can go. I have an idea for how I want to be perceived in the fashion world but have yet to actually be able to pull it off. But like I said earlier, I am trying.
Towards the end of my stay, I was thinking about approaching a woman that was by herself eating. And it wasn’t about attraction or anything like that at all. It was more like, “why don’t I go introduce myself and offer her an ear to listen.” Why is she alone? Is she lonely? Does she need help?
There was something oddly beautiful about being amid the old rusting former Bethlehem Steel plant where SteelStacks (the arts & cultural campus) is located.
How evil/nasty is the enemy? Very evil because no one knew it was there, no one could tell when it was laying the foundation for its demonic plans, then adding all the layers like icing on a cake.
I’m reading a book about the times throughout American history the news was wrong. Be it by human error or purposely to promote a cause, sometimes crucial facts were omitted or over exaggerated. Shocking. Terrible, right?
Of earthly binds and even false trust.
What better memory of the match than this goal (at 27 seconds on the clip below)? Mike Hooper the Liverpool goalkeeper on the day, was a noted ‘twitcher’ and his walkabout suggested that he thought he had seen the Lesser Spotted Gull Warbler on top of the West Stand. That you suspect made up Limpar’s mind to shoot; the goal is outstanding for the vision as much as the execution.
MINUSES - Normally I like logos on the front, but on this design the logo makes the front seem cramped. I think position should have been in that bubble. The red writing on the back is not really appealing.

The sale price works out to RM2.30 per E&O share, which is a 58.6% premium over the stock’s pre-suspension price of RM1.45. Sime Darby came out in defence of its purchase, saying the RM2.30 was actually a 20% discount to E&O’s estimated realisable net asset value of RM3.2bil or RM2.88 per share.
Hematoi descend from the unions of gods and mortals, and the children of two Hematoi—pure-bloods—have godlike powers. Children of Hematoi and mortals—well, not so much.

My partner has been “against the grain” in the past years, giving you what I have channelled about the weather. Is it global warming? No. Is it going to get better? No. This is a two-generation cycle. There will continue to be earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and storms. This is a recalibration of life in the ocean, and humanity must go through this in any way they can. This is a cycle, a known and expected one, but since you haven’t gone through it in modern times, it’s not well understood yet.

A couple of days sunshine and some time out of the house, enjoyed going for a walk even though it can be quite a struggle on uneven ground, spent some time crafting today too, will have to show you some of my crafting, I know it is not that good but it always helped me destress before all this happened to me, so I hope it will still help me now.
Part of the reason I’ve grown OK with discussing the fact that it’s taken me far longer than I would prefer to remove both names from my life is that I know most people have been there. And if we can’t discuss how absolutely annoying it is to want to be over someone and not quite be there amongst reading family, then when can we? Right?
An executive who works a 40-hour week for 50 weeks puts in a minimum of 2,000 hours yearly. But faculty members teaching 12 to 15 hours per week for 30 weeks spend only 360 to 450 hours per year in the classroom. Even in the unlikely event that they devote an equal amount of time to grading and class preparation, their workload is still only 36 to 45 percent of that of non-academic professionals. Yet they receive the same compensation.

You know how it feels when you're inspired and "in the zone" and you're mental wheels are really turning and you feel like you're being listened to and maybe, just maybe, having a positive impact? Well, it's been a long time since I've felt this way at work, which has been hard for me. But over the past couple of weeks, that has started to change. I feel like I'm beginning to get my professional mojo back, and it feels pretty fucking good.

While I've been playing catch up here, I've gotten really lax about responding to comments. I apologize for that. I just haven't MADE the time and I need to. Life does get busy, but comments are one of the very best parts of blogging. It means a lot to me that you all take the time to read my stuff and look at my pictures, and the comments are what lets me know that you do. I want to take a minute here and thank you all for being such a great audience, and letting me know that SOMEBODY hears me. In real life I sometimes feel like my voice is ... invisible. (Yes, I know. I sometimes mix metaphors too, and sometimes I make up my own words to boot.)

Yesterday, we had that blue sky that I’ve been yearning for. We also had a sun hot enough to encourage me to put on my gardening gloves and dig my spade into the cold, damp earth. I turned over the soil – “airing it,” even as I aired out my own winter-weary body. I felt this deep sense of – well, exultation, really. I just felt so joyful, so grateful, for this most optimistic of all seasons.

I am really getting excited about Traveller since there are no other races left before it. I have trained extremely hard the last several months and put in a lot of miles before other races just to build up my endurance for my next 100. I am ready to run this race more than any other race I have done. I am looking forward to having so many other people I know running and hopefully I will have the opportunity to run with them for a while. I feel I am prepared physically and mentally for this next challenge.

But my point is, we made our own choices. My parents didn’t choose for us. Now, was our choice a good choice? That’s debatable. Every one of you probably has an opinion on that. I'm sure my mother does.
Paul now addresses the theme of the parousia, or coming, of Jesus. There had evidently been some teaching or revelation concerning this event that left the Thessalonians unsettled. It may even be that an imposter wrote a false letter pretending to be Paul himself (v.2). The word that was being circulated apparently gave the impression that the Day of the Lord was a past event, an idea that Paul corrects by explaining that two events must, by necessity, come first.

Listen to the apostle Paul’s words on applying the truth of the resurrection of believers to our everyday lives: “Now my brothers and sisters, in light of these sublime truths, be steadfast in doing the Lord’s work, knowing that he will reward you at his coming.” (1 Corinthians 15:58) “Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.” (Colossians 3:1-3)

Every so often, we see an event that raises eyebrows even by the upside-down standards of Durham legal culture. Take, for instance, the three legal motions filed late last week on behalf of false accuser and accused murderer Crystal Mangum. The motions weren’t filed by Mangum’s court-appointed attorney—who told the H-S that he knew nothing about them. Instead, they were ostensibly written on the accused murderer’s behalf by none other than “lay advocate” Sydney Harr, who has spent the past few years in a quixotic crusade to restore Mike Nifong’s law license. Even more strangely, Mangum’s court-appointed lawyer said that Mangum hadn’t authorized the motions’ filings—but each motion has a signature that appears to match Mangum’s.

I think this is especially true of the Congressional Black Caucus, who as Mrs. Waters so vociferously pointed out, has felt "leashed" and unable to confront the president, because they worried about a backlash from the black community. While obviously the black community, and no other group as well, vote as a bloc, I think congressional Democrats - and especially the Congressional Black Caucus - have been walking on egg shells with regard to criticizing the president, because they don't want to scare people away from voting in 2012, and they don't want to anger a constituency that will get them personally re-elected. Waters stated this point in her meeting in Detroit, “We don’t put pressure on the president. Let me tell you why. We don’t put pressure on the president because ya’ll love the president. You love the president. You’re very proud to have a black man — first time in the history of the United States of America. If we go after the president too hard, you’re going after us.”

Green is a square elongated field, silent without motion, almost a place of worship where the co-cubic vectors of anti-matter time are surreally visible to one who is a witnesser to the event; i see in the corn cup this lateral elongation as a cyclical anti-cyclical process emerging that defines the positioning of the following metonymic particles: grasut, gravi, gerom and knabut; in the hari om tat sat, hari is om tatat hari in every iota of the wave-function PSI; in the rural supramental field Sri Chaitanya is every Christ worshipped by the prophet in the haritatat moon; this moon is the self of the yellow submarine in the old man’s house and that is Hemingway; the Llamas are walking on Hermitian space with Corinthian grace-loop in every hammer of Hephaestus.

Papa and I talked about this subject a few days ago. He began to name people who are examples of those "under authority." He also named some that he felt did not have an attitude of submission in their daily walk. We should be known for our submissive spirit. Our attitudes and actions tell all. The opposite of this would be "pride and arrogance."
Menu Tuesday doesn't quite roll off the tongue like Menu Monday does but seeing as it was a holiday weekend and we took a much needed break via our visit to Omaha this weekend, I thought I'd share with you what is on our menu this week.
Honestly, even if someone would have run through soundcheck yelling that same line before I’d lead worship on a Sunday morning, I could have waxed eloquent, made some agreeable remark, and gone right on with my plan.

Hubby has decided to update / restore the outside of our little 60+ year old bungalow (pictured at right in the 1990's) so it will last us 20 more years. I was glad he has been thinking in long-range terms, but I'm horrified at all the work he is having done.
To be fair, the worldbuilding has potential; the title, Shadowmagic, refers to a kind of magic that draws on tree sap rather than gold, the source for magic known as Truemagic. There’s also runes involved and lands that have affiliation with types of trees. Of course, it’s not explained very well, but it’s interesting! And I quite like the idea that the different types of magical creatures in Irish folklore are really just differing nationalities of folk in Tir Na Nog, as Conor points out at one point. So there’s that. But it’s buried under the weight of an aggressively unfunny main character, a complete lack of set-up for anything (which keeps it from having any impact), and some astounding stupidity on the part of the characters. Yeesh.
This week the Bitchin' Kitchen Supperclub Challenge was BBQ ribs. I love when the challenge requires me to really veganize the dish beyond just swapping out dairy or eggs. It's fun to push the limits of my (sometimes limited) imagination and come up with a compassionate version of a meat-centric meal.
Here’s hoping his daughter learns from this. I wouldn’t be surprised, however, if he receives backlash from this from her friends and even from other parents. He shouldn’t care, though. He did well.

Yesterday I went to a primary school pantomime in the sports hall of a very well-run new school in Woodford, Essex. The work put into the thing was amazing, but the Disney-esque innocence of Beauty & The Beast as performed by Year Three of Churchfields School was slightly undercut by the smell of stale plimsolls.
Wait, what? I’m in a cage again. They’re both gone. Are they coming back? Are they abandoning me? What will I eat after I finish the gooey stuff in this Kong? Actually, why don’t I just eat that now? It smells great and maybe some food will soothe my nerves…

The Malaysian Insider the past few days felt that it was important to highlight the current suit and counter suit between Danaharta and former Malaysia Airlines, TRI and Naluri Chairman Tan Sri Tajuddin. They were compelled to skew the on-going civil case, even to a point of false reporting and getting quotations meant to demonise a onetime power Malay business baron.

FA: Well it is a huge boost for us. Good confidence being quick here in Silverstone as no doubts it was a race on the calendar that had one red cross. We knew that it was not an easy grand prix for us in terms of the characteristics of the corners, the lay-out never being our strongest point, the high speed corners in the last two or three years so we knew that Silverstone like Barcelona, was difficult for us so winning here is good motivation for everyone and good confidence I am sure approaching the next races as they will be circuits that are a little bit better for us.

I've known Emma since elementary school, and our husbands just so happen to be best friends too! She gave me the sweetest shout out on her blog for my birthday, so I wanted to send her a little love as well. All the pictures she posted are exactly how I remember high school, and she's in every single one. We truly have been through everything together. I love this girl so much!

This is also where I made my only mistake in following the route, part way down the track turns left and a bridleway goes straight ahead, I followed the bridleway when actually I should have followed the track. You could ride either, just that the bridleway leads you down to the Monsal trail rather than under it and if you continue on the bridleway downward from there you end up crossing the river on a bridge that is not best suited to bikes with wide bars!

I have often asked myself and several of my friends what they would do once they have accomplished and fulfilled all their desires in life. Like, if you have got your ideal house, live in your ideal city or location, have an ideal family, and financially are very well and secure, what would you want to do next? And I began writing their answers in several small notes and pieces of paper and kept them. What I found from all of their answers was almost very profound and extremely interesting. Almost all of them said they would want to do these things:

I don’t have one particular crime novel I wish I’d written, because I enjoy a variety of crime – particularly American crime. But anything by Harlan Coben, as I like the way his character Myron Bolitar gets involved in all sorts of scrapes, plus the kind of attitude the character has. I like that style. And I also like anything by Tom Clancy, and the late, great James Crumley.

Needless to say, many of those who publish guff like this probably consider themselves to be great rationalists, waging an enlightenment war against the evil 'Whore of Babylon' (as some undoubtedly still view the Catholic Church). Sadly for them, though, most balanced people see this sort of negative obsession with a misconceived notion of Catholicism for what it really is - something more akin to old fashioned prejudice than enlightened commentary.

Chris Hoskins was born and raised in Orange County, California. In 1972, at the tender age of six, his grandfather, Edward Hanlon, took him for a ride in his 1965 Pontiac GTO. As they pulled out onto Harbor Boulevard, Grandpa Hanlon mashed his foot into the accelerator. In that moment, as the delightful scent of gasoline fumes wafted up through the cockpit, Chris was baptized into The Muscle Car Generation. Today, Chris is Chairman of the Muscle Car 1000, the most luxurious collector car adventure in America.

She went to the gym to vent. Jae Ha was there and saw a dejected Hang Ah. As she was running, she lost step and fell. Jae Ha noticed she was crying and easily asked who was the cause of it. Like friends, they talked and Jae Ha gave her comforting words. Sweet. Funny how Hang Ah said she does not have high standards in men but started to rumble about her ideal mate. After hearing it all, Jae Ha then approached her closely, as if reaching out to her for real. He told her that guys are nuts since for him Hang Ah is a woman. Smooth dude. Jae Ha then started to touch her hand and looked at Hang Ah’s eyes deeply.. Is he about to kiss her? OMO! Then again, it wasn’t gonna end in that direction.

It seems to me that so many blogging GM’s out there aren’t so into playing the game as they are writing about it. Getting more followers on their blogs (usually by joining each and every blog out there), having people read their game material, printing personal fanzines, or just plain having a voice in the OSR. If they get actual gaming going on, it seems just a thing to do so they can continue to do the ancillary things based on it with some amount of gravitas. But shit, if you have a group and it’s good, that should be the focus, right? But it is often not, it seems.
Before anyone realized, he joined those few out there and put up himself. At first he went clothed in the same sparkles familiar to his crowd, the friendly audience. Soon the clothes deteriorated, as the weather turned stormy. Pellets of snow, fat teardrops of rain, baking sun, and harsh winds came at him in hails of storms broken only sweltering heat. Insects helped themselves to his flesh, grime accumulated everywhere as he sat in disintegrated pieces of clothes falling away with the wind, holding up a self made sign like a flag of trust.
What makes the video even more fantastical is that Gaga tackles a very serious issue in a fun manner. Amid the frenzy at G.O.A.T (Government Owned Alien Territory in Space) Gaga delivers her important message of gender equality. As she narrates this is the birth of a new race, a race that will have no prejudice or judgment but boundless freedom you can’t argue that you’re witnessing the spawn of a new human race. The message is further decoded with the use of the inverted pink triangle seen throughout the video, a symbol of gay rights.
I turn away from the Darent at the pretty arched bridge which is the start of the annual duck race, along the road to the church of St Peter & St Paul. In gold gothic script on the lych gate are the words: Blessed are the Dead which die in the LORD. I’m not entirely sure if that’s a promise to the devout, or a subtle threat to the non-believer. Beyond the lych gate, a double row of stout neatly clipped Irish yews lines the path to the gabled entrance porch. A fantastic structure, its stocky timbers, some of which may date back to when it was first constructed in the 16th century, are weathered silver-grey with age.
Our Batman-adept managing editor Matt McDaniel, noted that in the original comic book series, Bane broke Batman’s back and the caped crusader had to be replaced.

Deputies searched the area and based on a detailed description of the vehicle, a Ford F-250 truck, they located the suspects driving west bound on Highway-192. They continued to follow the vehicle at a distance and observed the vehicle travel at a high rate of speed and run through a red light and a stop sign before it attempted to drive through a wall opening at the dead end of N. Lavon Avenue in Kissimmee. The vehicle crashed into the wall and the suspects fled on foot, but were apprehended a short distance later.
Advice…I’d say best of luck and always be you. Study never ends, every experience can teach you a lot about yourself and your craft, but be prepared for a lot of rejection, discouragement, lean times, hungry times, many days/weeks/months years of hard work and sacrifice for brief moments of joy/fulfillment…damn, are you sure you want to do this to yourself? I hope you ain’t getting into it for fame and fortune ‘cuz I know a lot of very talented and skilled performers who’ve been doing it for years and will NEVER have fame and fortune. If you still want to “get into the industry” despite all that, again I wish you good luck.
I left the house giving thanks that they too left the house after most of the church members had settled into the pews. I was the only witness to their act of male chauvinism.
The first thing I did was I divided this four-faced monster into two. I separated them into Input(listening and reading) and Output (Speaking and Writing). The reason is that the two input skills are more similar to each other than they are to the two output skills. Skills used for listening would probably benefit my skills for reading most (though it goes without saying that they will benefit the other two skills as well, just not as much)
The bigger question, however, is; do I love Christmas?
Reconciliation means reestablishing relationship. Christ has reconciled me to God and to others. Many barriers come between people—race, social status, sex, personality differences—but Christ can break down these barriers. Jesus Christ changed Onesimus’s relationship to Philemon from slave to brother. Christ can transform my most hopeless relationships into deep and loving friendships.

If suspicions about the arrest of IMF boss Dominic Strauss-Kahn were only half serious yesterday morning, during the afternoon New York time Timothy Geithner added weight to those who wonder what exactly might be going on here. He did this by being the fastest out of the starting blocks, and choosing New York’s prestigious Harvard Club to assert that the most important thing for the IMF was to find a leader who could fill Mr Strauss-Kahn’s shoes.
Then I added the grout, wiped it off the tile surfaces and smoothed the grout in between each tile to make it look uniform and not lumpy. I also added grout around the edges because I didn't want any jagged pieces. So the edges are yet to be smoothed out. The edged where the wood was showing I painted white, although it still needs another layer.

Anyway, he does come up with a few quotes worth repeating. As you know I am obsessed with collecting quotes. Sort of like Don Neuwirth who used to carry a notebook everywhere with him in which he copied things he heard or read that appealed to him; much like collecting stamps. I, on the other hand, always feel an unstoppable compulsion to move those quotes immediately from my possession and, welcome or not, into the consciousness of others.

We who are Christians know that Jesus is alive. We know it through faith. We know there is more life, better life waiting for us with him. We know it. But everyone keeps saying we have to move on. Everyone tells us we shouldn’t spend so much time thinking about it. Sometimes it feels like God hasn’t come through. But we know better. Don’t let go of that knowledge. Don’t give up that hope. Don’t fill your life with other things, don’t make yourself a life apart from the one who truly loves you and is coming back for you, no matter how long it seems.

School has been going great and she is still very happy and enjoys going every day. She is kind of a rock star and has made many friends quickly. Some of her classmates now argue over who will walk her to her class when the school doors open in the morning. Keaton is kind of bent out of shape because of this.
So, for my card, I've played with one of the November releases called "Warm Wishes" and it was tons of fun coloring it. I also used some Ranger Icicle Stickles, and however the light hits it is shimmers all kinds of colors. In my picture it looks like I have used silver and gold stickles, but I did not, it's the Icicle one and IRL it looks all silver-ish ;D;D For my "baubles, bells, anything hanging" I've used these little jingle bells on the bottom of the sentiment and to top it all off I created "icicles" which hang, right? To achieve that I used a strip of bling mesh (that stuff is awesome) I cut it 30 blings long and 4 blings wide to cover my 5.5"x5.5" card on the top. Before I adhered it I cut two of the blings in every second place to make it look like icicles. What do you think?

I feel that it's also important to note that upon gifting me with my little hot-pink gateway to better musicness, Mal named my iPod "Jenn's Wonderpod." Because she is awesome and she so gets me.
My question is, where do I go during that time? Maybe I'm being abducted and brought aboard the mother ship and random experiments are tested on me. Maybe they're feeding me fattening foods and that's why I'm gaining weight! Yeah, that's it, that's gotta be the reason! Aliens are making me fat.
5. Thus at the beginning of his address in Constantinople, on Christmas Day in 379 or 380, St Gregory Nazianzen uses some expressions of Psalm 95: “Christ is born: glorify him! Christ comes down from heaven: go to meet him! Christ is on earth: Be exalted! “Sing to the Lord, all the earth!’ (v. 1) and, to combine the two concepts, “Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice’ (v. 11), because of Him who is of heaven and then of earth” (Omelie sulla natività, Discorso 38, 1, Rome 1983, p. 44; Oration 38 on the Birthday of Christ, 1., Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, vol 7, p. 345, reprinted by Eerdmans March, 1989).

Unfortunately, nearly every other element of the production lags far behind the movement in quality. While Sean Gill’s script has an excellent spine, mixing elements of Russ Meyers’ Faster Pussycat Kill Kill with the homicidal dystopia of Paul Bartel’s Death Race 2000, the actual meat of the thing is pretty unbearable, full of scenes that overstay their welcome and lines that play less like a parody of bad dialogue than bad dialogue itself. This is ironic, because the draw here is the dancing. You could improve the show immeasurably by cutting every single line and telling the whole story as a Go-Go ballet – I’ve seen it done before.

As discussed earlier, I was (and maybe still am) on a big Guided By Voices kick a few weeks back. I've long been a fan, and still remember fondly their gig at Chicago's legendary Lounge Ax on my birthday in 1995, just two days after the release of their first "major league" LP Alien Lanes. Of course the phrase "Guided by Beer" was kicked around a few times, once by none other than Bob Pollard himself. Somewhere I used to have a tape of this show that I picked up years later; and the gig was as sloppily fun as I remembered it. I seem to recall that after 38 songs, they easily could have drunkenly stumbled through another 38.

You see, I am a firm believer in the healing powers of laughter and I think that most of us have a ‘Break-In-Case-Of-Emergency’ chuckle button backup for those situations that leave us feeling less than buoyant. For some that would be a funny friend, a favourite movie or poem or song, or maybe you just dive into a much-loved, witty WordPress blog that has given you a giggle in the past. These are all great things… and all things that are in my ‘Break-In-Case-Of-Emergency’ box as well… but I simply love that I have the power to give myself the gift of giggles. I will be the first to admit that many of my methods for doing so are not exactly fitting to a woman of my years – yes, I have moments of great and terrible immaturity – and that the average person would (likely) get absolutely no amusement from the things that twist my lips… it is what is.

Why is it that people think you have to be just like them in order to be of any value? I don’t get it. I read an article about Chik-Fil-A today that hit a nerve in precisely the right way to make me blow my lid and resulted in a Facebook status that reflected my lost temper. The gist of the article was the restaurant’s support of anti-gay organizations.
"Islamic extremism on campuses not only continues unabated, it continues – as this report demonstrates – to flourish. We hope that now the government and university authorities will finally act before a generation of students continues to be prey to an intolerant, separatist and violent ideology which threatens our society and the lives of not just of our citizens, but – as was shown again on Christmas Day – those of our allies and friends."

I love this link I found 100 things to do with a meyer lemon by Amy Scattergood from the LA Times. Number 83 was discussed a bit. So, when I started looking into that, I wondered what about a whole lemon, not just the peels. Which made me start researching this Japanese treat called simply "honey lemon slices." Seems like a popular manga character really likes them. I never really found out what they were, but I sliced a Meyer lemon and a few rangpur limes and tucked them neatly in their separate half-pint jars. Then I covered them with nice local honey. They've been in the fridge for a while steeping. I'm not quite sure what to do with them, honestly, but I am guessing in a week or two the slices will sink nicely in a drink, and the honey will do nicely with some seltzer.

But does Joseph really see me that way? Or is he now old enough to realize that not having any sight really does significantly impact most of what I do, in addition to what I desire to do. Maybe Joseph has taken notice how much my blindness has inconvenienced me when it’s time to go somewhere. Perhaps Joseph has just now started to discover how different I am from all of the other women in his life. Could it be that Joseph is now processing what I already know, but didn’t want him to know; that being blind honestly sucks.

Written in the nineteen-fifties by a minor Sicilian prince, the book is set in Sicily and primarily in the two years following Garibaldi's May 1860 landing on Sicily's south coast, which kick-started a revolution in the south and strengthened the Risorgimento, the movement for the unification of Italy and the destruction of the feudal system. The novel concerns Fabrizio Corbera, Sicilian Prince of Salina, who must come to terms with these social changes, and towards its end moves forward to 1883 and his death and finally to 1910 and the fate of his children. I hadn't had time to read the book by the meeting, and it may have been me, but I came away from the meeting with the impression that this was essentially the story of a love affair and a marriage: Don Fabrizio's daughter Concetta is in love with his orphaned and favoured nephew, the charming and wily Tancredi, and for a time Tancredi appears to be returning her affection. However, once he claps eyes on the beautiful and nouveau-riche Angelica, he decides to marry her instead. By the end of the novel and 1910, however, Angelica is a widow, and in their old age the two women have become friends, something which Jenny said she really relished, and where she felt the novel, which she had found rather hard-going, became more interesting and enjoyable.

The last time I felt suicidal was in 1998 and can honestly say I don't ever expect to feel that way again. I now have boundaries in my day to day life that stop me from going down the wrong path with people or situations that are emotionally unhealthy for me. I've also learned how to ask for help and accept it from others. These life skills have protected me from falling back into depression at times when previously I would have been vulnerable to it.

The beginning of the end started when my son was born. The plan was that my mother, who lives 12 hours away, would drive down after he was born to see us and meet him. His due date was great for her, because she would be finished with her volunteer work. Instead, he came a few weeks early. She said we'd have to wait 2 weeks before she could come. This sort of worked out well for us. Everything is HER way or NO way and she will make your life hell if you don't comply. The two weeks would help us establish a routine and such.
In any case, I'm still wrapping my head around There Will Be Blood. It's both an excellent period piece and big ol' fuck you to the contemporary devils of corporate America. I've been a fan of Anderson's since Boogie Nights, but this movie is a different creature. You can tell it's Anderson, but he's tighter, clearer, and he's finally got something real to say. I can honestly say that even if his next movie stars Tom Cruise AND Tom Hanks, I will see it.*
Because March marks the end of a weird, gestation period in Formula 1 every year. The sleepy winter tends to see racing factories “shut down”, though you know the engineers and supernerds are all still grinding away at race car design in secret. The season’s race cars are typically introduced around January. Then all the teams go to various racetracks and test the shit out of their new cars. Problem is, you can rarely tell what they’re testing for – often it’s aerodynamics, sometimes it’s a suspension setup, sometimes it’s an exhaust configuration, sometimes it’s fuel consumption, sometimes it’s the tires. But the lap times these cars rack up are typically useless to your average fan because you don’t know what they’re testing for. Still, all of that comes to an end by early March. The bullshit stops because it’s pencils down, and every team packs up their race gear – cars, tools, marketing swag, all of it – into large containers and fly the lot to Australia for the first grand prix race of the season. March is when everyone stops fucking around. March is when F1 gets real.
Hope you all have a lovely Christmas!

Elitism in beer is arguably a good thing for the beer industry. Whilst cheap fizzy gorgeous cooking lager may appeal to a wide number of people, cooking lager arguably does not appeal to an important demographic. That being “idiots with more money than sense”.

• On Now: Picasso Prints: The Vollard Suite. The British Museum is hosting this exhibition featuring Pablo Picasso’s most celebrated series of etchings, The Vollard Suite – the first time a complete set of the etchings has been shown in a British public institution. The suite consists of 100 etchings produced between 1930 and 1937, at a time when Picasso was involved in an affair with his nurse and muse Marie-Therese Walter. The predominant them of the suite is that of the sculptors studio – the artist was at this stage making sculpture at his new home outside Paris. The etchings, which have no titles and were not assigned an order, will be displayed alongside examples of the type of classical sculpture and objects which inspired the artist as well as Rembrandt etchings, Goya prints and Ingres drawings which also influenced Picasso’s works. The exhibition is being held in Room 90 and runs until 2nd September. Entry is free. For more, see www.britishmuseum.org.
I crossed my first picket line yesterday! I had tickets to see the new musical The Scottsboro Boys by the same folks who wrote Cabaret and Chicago. It’s a musical retelling of the story of nine black men who were wrongfully imprisoned for the rape of two white women in Alabama in the 1930s. The framing device is a minstrel show. Blackface is employed. The writers and director are all white. Yikes! Perhaps I shouldn’t have been surprised to enter past dozens of protesters chanting that the show was racist, that turning this tragic story into a minstrel show was akin to using Borscht Belt humor to talk about the Holocaust. For a show that deals with liberal white guilt, getting shouted at for being racist was actually kind of an affective prelude (more on this in a minute).

The first time I saw him was when Josh got to come into the operating room after everything was done. He got to hold him first and he showed me the baby. I thought something was wrong with him because his eyes were kind of cross eye... lol.

I spent less than $30 dollars and still have paint and two canvas left to paint. It did take some time……I did not have my kids cut pictures out so I did that work myself and a little trial and error about the puckering of the paper when I realized when it was done that is what gives the canvas character. All that worry for nothing. I did not do a bird cut out but a monogram of my first initial of my last name. It looks good plus its going in the bathroom so the B could be for bathroom as well.

A look back at how last year’s previewed movies did at the box office. The budgets and box office numbers are courtesy of Box Office Mojo. My verdicts are based on the typical studio formula that for a movie to break even it must make twice its production budget; any movie that achieves that will be labeled as profitable. I define hit movies as those that make three times the production budget and blockbusters as anything that makes $200 million in domestic box office or more, or made five times the production budget with a minimum of $100 million in domestic box office. The first four movies listed are the five main previewed items; I’ve also chosen a selection of other major releases that made the preview issue as well.

I woke up at 3:30pm, dusty and sweaty, and started out again. I could just about see my shadow clinging to the rear wheel to the right. The sun was like a large bouncing ball that goes up fast and seems to come to a standstill at the zenith before beginning it’s incredibly speedy descent. It reminded me of the question in the physics exams about why basketball players seem to freeze at the top of the jump. Well the sun was right now stuck to the top, not frozen, but stuck because it had caused the fabric of the sky to melt and gone and gotten stuck. I find that I can ride really well if I can see my shadow beside me, maybe it’s because being vain I find inspiration in my own shadow riding well, or maybe it’s because you can only see the shadow when the sun is lower. And while I was melting in the midst of such musings I saw kids playing under the blazing sun in a courtyard. So I figured if they could do it, so could I.

When I reviewed the remake of The Fly, I found myself extremely disappointed. Not in the movie or in the review, but at something that was missing from the movie. Before seeing it, I knew only the basic premise and one simple line that came to represent the movie in only two words: Help me. And when I watched the remake, I was waiting for that line to show up throughout the entire movie, only to be extremely saddened when it never came. When I did some research, I found that the line was actually from the original 1958 version of The Fly, and was not included (at least not in the goofy way that is always parodied) in the remake. This only cemented the idea with me that I needed to see the original. And, since it is also available on Netflix streaming, it took me no time to get myself satisfied. Amazing how often the internet is able to help me satisfy myself immediately, isn’t it? … Anyways, today’s movie is the original version of The Fly, written by James Clavell, directed by Kurt Neumann, and starring Patricia Owens, David Hedison, Vincent Price, Charles Herbert, Herbert Marshall, Kathleen Freeman, and Betty Lou Gerson.

I don’t know why the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is so popular with children. The centrepiece of the movie occurs in the state of Vulgaria, where children are reduced to the status of vermin, scavenging for food in various dank and dirty cellars. Those who manage to escape into open country are ruthlessly snared by an astonishingly evil and big-nosed child catcher, who exhibits them in his cage for the paedophobic Baroness to inspect. All the toys manufactured in the land are for the exclusive use of the Baron, who in spite of being many years older than his wife is himself an overgrown child. Yet the attractive Baroness dotes on her husband, remaining loyally by his side even after he has been deposed. What possible pleasure could a child derive from such a grim and unnatural setting?

John Wycliffe (c. 1328 – December 31, 1384) was an English Scholastic philosopher, theologian, lay preacher, translator, reformer and university teacher at Oxford in England, who was known as an early dissident in the Roman Catholic Church during the 14th century. His followers were known as Lollards, a somewhat rebellious movement, which preached anticlerical and biblically-centred reforms. The Lollard movement, was a precursor to the Protestant Reformation (for this reason, Wycliffe is sometimes called “The Morning Star of the Reformation”). He was one of the earliest opponents of papal authority influencing secular power.

Bandung in West Java, Indonesia, has long been an exclusive weekend resort destination, blessed with a relatively cool year-round temperature averaging 24 degrees Celsius given its location in the elevated valley of the Parahyangan Mountain range. After Indonesian independence from the Dutch in 1945, rapid development and urbanization transformed Bandung from an idyllic town into the now bustling Metropolitan area of 15,000 people per km². Despite its dense population, Bandung still retains the charm that attracts weekend travellers, visitors and business travellers from Jakarta and beyond.

This year the Glastonbury Festival marks its fortieth anniversary, the first (then free) festival taking place on a cobbled together tubular steel and wooden plank stage in 1971. In order to celebrate the fact, a ‘Spirit of ‘71’ stage was included this year where many of those who performed in 1971 returned to the scene of their crimes to perform to nostalgic on-lookers.

I have a couple of exotic pets that eat crickets. Sometimes, the crickets get loose. A house spider or two keep the population in check. They do not bite me, eat my food, or bother my pets, so I leave them alone. Now, I don’t want an infestation in my home, but it doesn’t bother me a bit to have a few spiders running around.
But maybe I can’t look at it as “90% of this relationship is me tolerating your crap, and the other 10% of the time it’s you dealing with me.” Maybe I also need to adjust my thinking in terms of things I do/don’t do. I always focus on the fact that I don’t do typical big no-no things like nagging and that I’m good at picking my battles; but maybe there are some things that I do do lol And that if someone is able to take my little issues here and there, then surely I should be willing to take on theirs, right? Because I could just be a stronger person – like I’m able to handle the crap they throw at me, but if I threw the same to them, they wouldn’t be able to handle it. It really comes down to a relativity thing: if he forgets my birthday, I’m not gonna spaz – guys are dumb and that shit happens. Some guys I’ve dated (yes, really), if I had ever forgotten their bday, the world would’ve fallen apart. Yeah, you could say this is where really getting to know someone comes in – because if you take the time to discuss things and see how they react to certain things, you can feel out if you guys are on the same page, and if you are, there shouldn’t be any issues – everyone should be in agreement as to what things are going to drive a wedge between you. But we all know that’s not always the case…

Childbirth is an excruciating process: a woman is placed in a position of incredible vulnerability, and the agonizing pain can be unrelenting and frightening. This is not a situation where you want to be in a strange environment with people talking down to you, often in a language you don’t understand, where your family is left outside and you are alone and subjected to seemingly alien procedures. Commentators are increasingly deriding the public health discourse for neglecting the importance of quality of care, but it’s not merely the quality that is at stake, yet also the appropriateness of care. Are we providing an environment of care that women actually want?
Please don’t make a comment after you have read this and tell me this disease was invented by the Apartheid rulers to wipe us out. I’m not even going to discuss that old stale story!

It was kind of fun going through all the pictures I’ve collected. Many can be easily deleted, as soon as I figure out what I was thinking when I took a picture of a featureless patch of grass. Others represent fond memories of family life: a wedding picture of me and my wife, my son’s graduation from elementary school, the time our cat thought it would be fun to go for a swim in the toilet. Still others are from my business trips overseas.

It felt like time for a bit of science, so I picked up this one. I'm a fan of Dawkins' books and have read several of his earlier works. This one's subtitle is The Evidence for Evolution. It seems crazy that here in the 21st century we still need to publish books on this subject, amazing that there are people out there who need convincing of it. Dawkins calls them (the creationists) 'history-deniers' and it is an apt name. What frightens me is that history-deniers, especially in the USA, teach in schools and colleges and run for high political office. Evolution is not a theory any longer - it's proven fact and there is an immense weight of evidence behind it. In my opinion (and Dawkins') only the spectacularly uninformed can argue against it.

I genuinely adore No 7 products so was very excited by this range. If you're like me and you get excited by some pretty packaging then you will see that this range does not disappoint.

The only thing I know to do when I have a need is to begin to give generously to other people, to love them well and to rest in knowing that God loves me more than I love others. My problem this week has been that I have allowed my focus to shift onto our mountain. That's not where it should be. My focus should be on God and loving the ones He places in my path. Allowing Him to use me however He desires. I have never done a post like this one. I have told you all before that I don't share things here with you unless, I'm willing to participate (financially) in the need, so what I'm about to share is going to STRETCH me and STRETCH our family. I have prayed over each of these families and their fundraisers and have wanted to share them with you and so, in effort to be obedient, here we go.

Austin, TX- August 29th, 2008 – The University of Texas announced last week its intention to close the Accessibility Institute, founded by Dr. John Slatin, a faculty member who passed away earlier this year. The Accessibility Institute was founded by Dr. Slatin in the early 1990’s as the Institute for Technology and Learning (ITAL), to research effective methods for employing technology in teaching and learning environments. His work at ITAL and the emerging dominance of electronic information technology led Dr. Slatin to research design methods and practices that would ensure that no one was left out of educational opportunity because of disability. His own progressive blindness was one factor, but Dr. Slatin’s passion for art, literature and the humanities led his commitment to include everyone as technology transformed teaching and learning. At the Accessibility Institute, John Slatin pioneered studies that helped an emerging industry frame its ideas for highly usable and inclusive interface design methods.

I missed joining in last week because we had a family re-union of sorts which involved meeting up with our niece for the first time since she was a baby and her mum and my brother parted... long story but my niece has 'seen the light' and now realises all the bull she was fed as a child and growing up about how things happened and why. My niece got back in touch with my brother recently - we did have faith that she would do one day. She also wanted to meet us all as she couldn't remember us - and lo and behold, she came with her 17 month old son, partner and another on the way. We had a good time - and it was all arranged to take place at my house seeing as I have the largest house of us all (which has its drawbacks because I always end up with the cleaning up then) - however, due to the circumstances, that didn't matter one tiny bit. Wow - this makes me a great aunt, my younger brother (who was only 40 on Saturday) a grandad (ouch!) and my mum a great-grandma... it was just so brilliant - so i'm afraid WOYWW lost out!

It’s because I realized Shepherd’s Pie used to be made with leftovers! Leftover lamb, leftover roast beef (called something else I can’t remember). So today, I minced (by hand with a chef’s knife, although I suppose a food processor work work too) my leftover oven roast from like…a week ago…, threw it into a glass container, added some frozen corn (I LOVE frozen corn..well..corn, but frozen is super convenient), and topped with some mashed potatoes made this morning out of the last 4-5 sad smushy spuds at the bottom of the potato bag. Then my toaster oven baked away at 350F for 30 min, and now I have dinner! Actually I think the leftovers will be tomorrow’s dinner/lunch too.

This is to be a transitional or even a pivotal month of swirling colours, potentials and currents that will eventually see each one of us exit along a path that only a minority have seen coming at all. Pluto is in Capricorn (where it has been exerting economic crises upon us) and Uranus in Aries (amid a loud chorus of pointed public protests) whilst Neptune flooding into Pisces this year made the walls of the Social Contract fall down and may have helped dissolve our cognisance of truth under the insidious ideological crossfire that broke out, serving only to turn most of us against all politicians and all politicking and pointing-up the sheer myth of “leadership”. These major forces will now abate like the tide leaving the sands fluid, harmonized without clear definition. If you should fall back on the borrowed methods for coping that you have always employed you will be out on your own even more than if you improvise freely. Better than both, stay as collected as the stars will allow and avoid the pull of short-term comforts, jumping only to where the happy hands of synchronicity are pointing you. On the daily-bread level: look after your greatest inheritance and recognize the most important people in your life.

I doubt if a single politician running for office in the last 20 years has opposed effort to reduce the federal budget, yet the Congress has been impotent in drafting one because we have so many diverse interests.

Though the Steelers have made it look easy in racking up 12 wins, their road to the playoff did have its own difficulties. Pittsburgh passed nearly every test put before it with flying colors, dominating the AFC North and the AFC, as a whole.

So, what is cyberbullying? It is bullying and harassment but instead of being done in a real life setting, it is done over the computer, in chat rooms, social networking sites, or via text message, or emails. In short, it is bullying done using a piece of electronic equipment. Now, in real life, we can walk away from a bully, disconnect ourselves from that person, at least in the best case scenarios. But because the internet is everywhere, providing endless forums for the bully to use to perpetrate their crime, cyberbullying can be far harder to stop, and can exact an even higher emotional toll on the person being cyberbullied. We are well aware that cyberbullying has lead to suicides among teens, and while most adults have more resources and life experience to withstand the cyberbully, there is still a toll for the adult being bullied, be it emotional, physical, or spiritual, or the attempted ruination of a reputation.

The chief challenge facing Canada's health care system is well-known: Lengthy waits for diagnostic tests and non-acute surgical procedures and -- in some areas -- primary care physicians. In 2005, Canada's Supreme Court determined that the country's prohibition on private insurance limited access was therefore dangerous. The long-term effect on Canada's single-tier system remains to be seen.
Immediately after this we meet Roose Bolton. Whilst he wasn’t as creepy as I’d imagined him, Roose was perfectly calm and seemingly normal, until he started talking about flaying Lannister officers. He’s definitely someone that new viewers will be keeping an eye on. Next, we meet Oona Chaplin’s character, who was reported to be named Jeyne, but gives the name Alyssa, or maybe it was Talissa, I don’t know, it was hard to hear. If she is indeed Jeyne Westerling, as was indicated when she was cast, I’m really interested in how HBO are going to change Robb’s romance on screen. It seems to me like he’s going to fall for this strong willed foreigner, only to find that she is in fact the daughter of one of his enemies’ vassals. I honestly think that would be more compelling than what happens ‘off-screen’ in the books, where Jeyne nurses Robb, they have sex, and he marries her out of honour.

Instead, Channel Thirteen has avoided chances to cover these issues. The first significant documentary about Ratner’s Atlantic Yards project was Isabel Hill’s 2006 “Brooklyn Matters.” The negative predictions about the mega-development in that documentary presaged much of what ultimately came to pass. Had it been more widely aired it might have changed the sorrowful course of events seen unfolding in the subsequent 2011 Atlantic Yards documentary “Battle For Brooklyn,” which made the short list for best documentary Academy Award nomination over such other films as “Page One: Inside the New York Times.”

There is one distinction that we feel is important. This is that there are Messenger Angels whose task it is to transmit or relay messages to individual humans. Then there are those Messenger Angels whose task involves a message bring transmitted to humanity as a whole. A message transmitted to an individual concerns the individual rather than the masses and more often than not it is a message that does not influence or apply to those closest to the individual who received the message. Needless to say, the individual, in responding to the message, may indeed affect other people, but the message itself is given only to the individual. Messenger Angels who bring messages to humanity as a whole bring a message that will in time affect and influence humans the world over. Perhaps there are those who think that such messages are always religious or spiritual in nature, but this is not the case.

Before advertising became prominent, the price of a newspaper had to cover the costs of doing business. With the growth of advertising, papers that attracted ads could afford a copy price well below production costs. This put papers lacking in advertising at a serious disadvantage: their prices would tend to be higher, curtailing sales, and they would have less surplus to invest in improving the salability of the paper (features, attractive format, promotion, etc.). For this reason, an advertising-based system will tend to drive out of existence or into marginality the media companies and types that depend on revenue from sales alone. With advertising, the free market does not yield a neutral system in which final buyer choice decides. The advertisers’ choices influence media prosperity and survival The ad-based media receive an advertising subsidy that gives them a price-marketing-quality edge, which allows them to encroach on and further weaken their ad-free (or ad-disadvantaged) rivals. Even if ad-based media cater to an affluent (“upscale”) audience, they easily pick up a large part of the “downscale” audience, and their rivals lose market share and are eventually driven out or marginalized.

Throughout his constitutional writings Anastaplo argues that the freedom of a self-governing people depends above all on their recognition that freedom is secured by self-discipline and by a self-imposed restraint that looks beyond mere self-interest. Modern no less than ancient political communities are defined by their shared view of justice and happiness. In pursuit of happiness the ancients looked to politics to promote virtue. Modern constitutionalism looks to virtue in the form of discipline and moderation, to secure equality and rights, and to protect free republican politics.

In my experience, when you’re trying to lose weight, spare or free time tends to make things worse, especially if you have a full fridge. (Actually our fridge is on the fritz at the moment but that’s not important right now). The one thing I’ve found useful in not pilling back the lost weight on is resisting that urge to go through the kitchen and take a bite out of everything in the kitchen. It’s important to remember not to eat while you do other things as well as this means you’re less likely to continue eating just because your favourite programme hasn’t finished yet. Besides, if you’re trying to lose weight, chances are you’re going to miss a lot of television anyway. Yes, that’s right. What’s more important to you? This weight loss or who got voted out of the X Factor? If you answer the first one, then you’re clearly not motivated to the cause (and your television should be dragged into the street and kicked several times for showing that awful show).

Not so my copy of 'The South Country', which is a new, sweet-smelling paperback published by Little Toller Books. Yes, there is a publisher that loves old books enough to rescue them from the charity shop and reissue them, and does so with style and economy. Inspired in part by Common Ground and their wonderful 'England in Particular', Little Toller has gone deep into the back catalogue, like Edward Thomas exploring the hidden lanes of Sussex and Hampshire, and pulled out a series of wonders. It is fitting that the press has as its emblem a figure from the Saxon font in the church at Little Toller in Dorset, one of artist and antiquarian John Piper's favourite objects.
And at what point do we declare, though it is not an end, that we have our wish, the happy ending we tried for so long to cobble together - through writing, wishing, tap dancing, perfect phrases, praying, beseeching and other even more destructive and less attractive efforts. What are the elements of a very personal happy ending: I'm still here. I am able to spend my time doing things which have meaning for me and make me content. I gradually become better (by my definition) at what I do. I have family and friends whom I love and who love me back and we speak the same language. I am in the company of people who all keep rowing pretty much in the same direction. The universe continues to send messages of encouragement, saying press on, its love notes, surprises and serendipity like clues on a treasure hunt.

36 Otomo Yoshihide - Lupin the Third Theme of Walther
So far away but so close to my heart, I can see them through my cloud. The cloud, which now seems to follow me with every step that I make and every move I take. A shop window smashes near a suburban street corner. Footsteps pound and voices rise. These are my streets at night; it is my domain, my world, my castle and my home. And yet, I’m still so very alone.
I also get to hear a lot about romance. Both the boys and the girls write poems about their current loves, lost loves, broken or disappointed loves, and hopes and dreams for love in the future. I took those two threads of starting a new life and falling in love and wove them together in WEAVING MAGIC.
My Wednesday evenings are one night of the week where both of my guys are gone, and I have been really treasuring the ‘Alone’ time, pampering myself with candlelight, a glass of wine, classical music and usually some simple meals that are for my mouth only. Do you eat differently when you’re alone? And I don’t mean standing over the sink munching on peanut butter off a spoon, or eating dry cereal by the handful while watching TV, what I mean is, do you take the time to really nurture yourself with good food when you’re alone? Because you should. It’s delightful, really. And with the way most people seem to cram their lives with activity and movement, some time alone is one aspect of our lives that we so desperately need. I know that for myself, I thrive on having some time that is just mine. And my life is pretty simple too; I don’t have much now that pulls me in every direction but that doesn’t change my need to be with myself, to remember what I like and enjoy, to be kind to the ‘Me’ that I know, to who I am. I’ve been this way ever since I can remember.
Not much to report today, it was my first day of the week working with Company B. I made aware today that it was my fourth week working with Company B and I could have sworn that it was my third. Time does fly, for the most part, because it seemed to be a little stagnant today at work. I spent my entire time there scanning these floor plans from a new project.

While in Leeds on Christmas Eve, I took my wallet in my hands and nipped into Zak Avery's shop for a quick peruse. I bought four bottles and had a chat with Ghost Drinker, who seems a very nice chap.

Good morning everyone. I apologize for not sending an activity for yesterday. I woke up and my day was a complete whirlwind and before I knew it I was getting into bed at the end of a very frazzled day. The good news though is that these activities can be done all through the month and not just on the day it is given. So let me share with you now the activity that was to have been for yesterday.
I shared all the good reports we’d received while she’d been in the operating room as well as Dr. Varin’s very optimistic news afterwards.
Also, why does the film only show us part of the passport and why is the part showing the Issue date and expiry date redacted (blurred out) ..WHY? What exactly is the state secret about the issue date of the Presidents passport, or its expiry date?
Lots of people today take design/decorating for granted. Homeowners usually opt to do the decorating themselves instead of hiring a professional to do the job for them. Considering how the economy is nowadays, this isn’t really surprising. However, what most people don’t realize is that hiring an interior decorator is cheaper in the long run due to various advantages that they can only get through a professional.

This morning as I was getting ready for the gym (see: massive t-shirt that should really be housing a family in a refugee camp somewhere, yoga pants that have never darkened the surface of a yoga mat) Tartarus remarked that my nethers seemed to have 'escaped' the confines of my Big Pants in much the same way as clump of weeds might surreptitiously take-over a flower bed without you noticing. To be perfectly honest, it's now At One with my hairy legs :-) I know. I sound like a DELIGHT to be close to. But the heating is OFF most of the time in our house - it's a heat-retention technique *cough*

I won't buy another copy new, but good stories are good stories even if they're told by a greedy, bigoted asshole who I nonetheless will endeavor to consider a person deserving of love. And I don't even claim to be a Christian.
Measures 1 1/2"
Saturday was a busy, busy, busy day! Will and I headed to a birthday party at Chuck E Cheese’s at 12pm for a boy in his class. I’ve never been there on a Saturday and I hope I never go back on a Saturday! Whoa! It was a mad house. Will still had a great time playing with everything. He liked the thing you crawl up in and then crawl all around the most. I ended up giving away his coins because he was only wanting to play in there. We left there at 2pm and we met up with Drew and Lindy and Mimo. Drew dropped Lindy off with us and then Mimo and the kids and I went to our second birthday party for our friend Riley. It was at a gymnastics place. They started out getting to play in a bounce house and then they let them run wild in the gym part. There were 30+ kids running wild! They all had a blast but I had to save Lindy a couple times from being taken out. It was great to have Mimo around to help me out! We left there, headed home, ate dinner, and then Drew and I headed out to the UNC School of the Arts symphony. Although I was pretty sleepy from two birthday parties, I managed to stay awake. It was really neat and it is so impressive that they are just in college. Everything we’ve seen at the UNCSA is fantastic. Mimo watched the kids and spent the night with us so we could go listen to the music.
Let me say right off the bat that this is predictable territory. Nothing new here. A woman is looking for Mr. Right and discovers before it's too late that he was right under her nose the whole time. It's been done to death, and you know it as soon as "the hunky new neighbor" walks in the door. Yawn.

Ry Torhan, the youth pastor at The Gate, and his wife, Heather, went to see the Harlem Globetrotters. Ry gets along well with everyone. When he sat down next to a man who was there with his family, they quickly hit it off. At halftime an official for the team invited the man and his family to follow him. A few minutes later they returned, weighed down in complementary Globetrotter gear. Before the team rep left he invited the family to the VIP room after the game to meet the players and to get their autographs.

The sexually active population do not face such a spiritual dilemma because there are a number of sexual programs to which they can subscribe: The paid sexual satisfaction program, the friends with benefit program, the booty call program, the one night stand program, and the sex outside of marriage in a committed relationship program. The single Christian has…ummm….wait…well… God. There are no easy and quick fix solution for the sexually on fire Christians despite the fact that they do exist in very large secretive numbers. Why? because no one would ever thing that being a single christian would entitle you to have any sexuality at all. They are all castrated monks.

Poverty and cultural deprivation often work in direct opposition to the goals and ambitions of at-risk youngsters, since their parents are too stressed out by the day-to-day struggles of survival to have anything left over to give to nurturing or encouragement. Often, because of the repetitive cycle of poverty, the parents, themselves, come from homes where mere survival trumped everything else, leaving them ill equipped to break the chain of struggle and failure.

2. Most writers are advised to introduce their protagonist asap. You open with three characters that basically don't appear again and the heroine, Josie, is nowhere to be seen. Was this an issue since it seems to go so strongly against received wisdom? Can you give us a bit of background on the editing and rewriting process?
Now the hard part. You see the first of those hour glider legs was this first one to Fujairah, UAE. We are not gonna do it. Scratch scratch, mumble mumble, shuffle shuffle and we decide that as soon as we clear Indian airspace we're gonna call and make a technical stop in Karachi, Pakistan.
The next appointment we had was with the developmental pediatrician. This was an appointment that we were pretty nervous about. At this appointment she was looked at by a physical therapist, occupational therapist, nutritionist, speech therapist, and then the developmental pediatrician. Everything went really well. We were told by the physical therapist that she has improved quite a bit and that she sees no reason why she wouldn 't be able to walk. Everyone else said she looked great. The pediatrician reviewed everyones notes and then came in the room to speak with us. All he could do during the appointment was smile. He said that he is very happy with her progress and he described her as highly intelligent. He said that there wasn't anything she needed to be working on because in a lot of areas she has advanced!

The right-wing can fire up their base during primaries with direct-hatred opportunities like this, and win elections. This doesn't work as well in general elections.
I am excited that our family is finding a new routine from what we are used to and all this recent change may just become our new normal because I think we're getting pretty good at it. We are doing well at adapting and making do with our situations. My husband and I took a leap of faith (some may call irresponsibility, we're calling it a leap of faith) and he quit his job. He has an interview in the morning and we are very hopeful that this will allow us the opportunity to spend more family time together and have our Saturdays together again as well.

Sooo...I had a list of what I was going to be working on this month. How's that been going for me, you ask? Well...I kinda registered for two online classes, which started February 1st and 3rd. I have spent zero time on one of them, and an inordinate amount of time on the other! As in, I got started a little late and completely underestimated how much time I'd need to put into it! It's a temari class. If you don't know what a temari is, it's basically a thread ball that's geometrically divided and then stitched on. The craft originated in Japan (some say Buddhists brought it over, but the Japanese definitely perfected it). I think you'll be able to see a picture of the temari on the group page here.

So it becomes clearer – at least it does to me – that accepting the Old Testament’s view of God is increasingly untenable. If the God we worship is truly love, is truly merciful and gracious and just, then he cannot be the God of the Old Testament, who orders the execution of infants and rains fire and brimstone on whole cities while turning the repressed of those cities into salt when they mourn the loss of what little lives they knew.

I wasn't planning to see Runaway Train (1985) this weekend; it's available via Netflix, and was thus not a viewing priority for me. But apparently the Film Society got a wrong print of Treasure Island and only realized it 20 minutes before its scheduled Saturday 2 p.m. screening! So Konchalovsky's film was chosen as its last-minute replacement. Having not seen the film before—and remembering that I was planning to see Tony Scott's new runaway-train movie Unstoppable the next day (more on that later)—I decided I might as well check this out. The film I ended up seeing was, to my mind, a wildly uneven one...but one with an ending so stunning that I'm willing to forgive it a lot. [Spoilers are ahead, obviously, for those who have never seen the film.]
Well, my professor has an opinion, and it’s a strong one.

While I thought this was pretty clear, lots of people didn’t. From looking around on Rotten Tomatoes, this accounts for 15% of the reviews, tops. This brings up another question: Why should Snyder’s intent matter? What’s the point of making a movie to criticize pigs who yell catcalls at women on ComicCon panels if they don’t even understand they are being criticized (and may even interpret it the opposite way and like it) and the only people who “get it” are film nerds who weren’t a part of the problem? This is a legitimate concern, which I will address in-depth in future articles, but the short answer is that this applies to pretty much everything to some degree. Every couple of years, someone tries to get Huckleberry Finn banned from a school library on the grounds that it’s racist for using the word “nigger” repeatedly. Defenders will argue this is meant to depict the realities of racism at the time and it’s actually about realizing that racism is all a pack of lies spread by repugnant people. (Which is oversimplifying, but no sense spending a bunch more space on a book you’re all familiar with.) The fact that a lot of people see this won’t make the objectors feel any better. There is no magic percentage of people buying any particular interpretation that can make it correct. To the people who like it, Sucker Punch a good film, and I think that that’s enough. I think part of the problem was that the MPAA forced a critical scene to be cut and the director’s cut would have gone over somewhat better, but an R-film would have made less money. I still harbor some suspicion that Showgirls is a brilliant social satire that somehow no one has managed to understand as of yet. How can we ever condemn anything in this case? That’s a tricky issue which I will address later.
I'd love to hear if you try this! :)

CalvinKlein sunglasses are both functional and practical, giving you real value for your hard-earned money... that is and deadly in a positive way. Though known for their true standards of cotton rich fabrics. They are also simple enough that they carry more than one age group, which is a refreshing scent that is always ready to face the calvin klein catalog a wide variety of colors, which cater to the boot calvin klein. Calvin Klein sunglasses, T-shirt and jeans. The Calvin Klein body because it is a globally recognized fashion, design and fashion. However, all that focus has changed now thanks to a visually stunning physique. Is it from good genetics? Do they have any name brands because they are known for being out-of-this-world. Calvin Klein dress they know and trust, such as cost, material, color options, mode of payment, delivery time, shipping charges, etc. To buy a brand that everyone knows and trusts. When a woman buys a Calvin Klein produces sportswear, men's undergarments, and a spirit of fun at the classic t shirt bra.
According to Mark McLoran of Agro-Terra, the Earth’s population is currently growing by 70-80 million people per year.

Don’t feel sorry for me, I would much rather you simply share similar tales of frustration from work, or possibly irritants from your profession. Let’s commiserate in our misery in the hopes that we’ll cheer one another up. I know it sounds weird, but I don’t need to hear anymore of the ‘Polly Anna think’ prevalent in motivational classes. I prefer something similar to watching an episode of ‘Cops’, so I can feel less stupid, and appreciate the choices I’ve made. Who’s in?
What goals do you have set for yourself for this round? Looking back on my first round, I can tell I was nervous and unsure the I would succeed. I set good goals, but what I set were small goals. I suppose, so that I could be sure I would achieve them. I look forward to setting myself a big challenge now, as it gives me something to really work hard for over each 12 weeks. For me this round, running is definitely going to be that thing!! Who knows, I might become a regular Forest Gump and just keep on running!!

What’s not explained in either one is that sigla with raised numbers after them usualy refer to correctors of a text, which are later than sigla with a star after it, which is the original reading. Thus B2 is later than B*, and a less convincing reading usually.

Both the Oneida and Architec have lasted a long time and, all things considered, were the best all-around options. That said, a well-made wood cutting board is the direction I am heading in. The ubiquitous John Boos boards are seen on most cooking shows and I’m sure would be a sound investment.
It would be absolutely surreal.

So, how have I dealt with this anxiety? I've seen my family doctor twice, and he has prescribed Xanax, which I only take in extremely anxiety producing times. I've been pretty successful in really only taking them as needed since becoming addicted to it is extremely easy, and that is worrying. He also prescribed an SSRI, which didn't seem effective, and the possibility of gaining weight was also worrying. I weaned off of it, and in hindsight, it did have a very subtle effect.

greatly respect President Carter for all of the good things he has done. Eradication of disease, so many things he has done since he has been out of office. I also respect the fact, I have to say, that even when I disagree with him, whether on matters theological or matters political and cultural, here is a man who is in his ninth decade of life, is still actively engaged in a way that is not only serious but indeed courageous in terms of the fact that he articulates his beliefs, he stands behind them, and he is willing to stand before the watching world and stay on his own two feet for all that he believes. This is also the kind of conversation in which, to be honest, I face a great personal challenge. And that personal challenge is to be reminded again and again of what it means for personal conviction to intersect with an entire web of personal relationships that are important not only to me, not only to a local church and to a denomination, but to a nation and to a watching world. A conversation like this is a matter of stewardship. It has given us a lot to think about. And as we think about these things, my greatest concern is that we would be faithful to the full authority and truthfulness of scripture, to the integrity of the gospel, the faith once for all delivered to the saints. And along with President Carter, who speaks very candidly of his conviction, it reminds us to speak with equal candor of our own. There is a lot to learn from each other in a conversation like this. That is why it is important to think and to enter into conversation with people whose beliefs are not identical to our own. And the great stewardship of course, is not only having the
