It has become something of a cliche of modern wines that they are delicious to drink on release and can also be aged, it really was true here. The young wines gave an explosion of fruit which masked the tannins and most of the structure – which made them attractive and approachable. The older wines though had emerged from their obviously fruity stage to be something much more complex and compelling.

I’ve begun to put together, in my head, and in digital bits stored on multiple hard disk drives, and flash drives, a story. It will be a book. I’ll eventually have the book written. But for now, I felt like sharing this little clip of the story. Which is by no means complete. Letting my creativity loose, and using my imagination, is fun.

So is Stephanie. We were talking about what we enjoyed one night a couple of weeks back, and there was a pretty good list that could be summed up as “almost everything.” One particularly shiny spot was the Regimental Drum Major competition. We liked watching them strut their stuff, and we really liked the spotlight demonstration by a fellow who wasn’t part of the competition. He was making a guest appearance. I’m not sure what his name is. I looked over the program from last year and couldn’t find it, but what I think I remember is that he was holding a world champion title for his fancy work. Stephanie found a YouTube video recorded and uploaded by someone who also attended the Games of him performing his demonstration. Hope you enjoy it!

Now Jessica looked like a movie star with her hair held high up in a bun. Pink beaded earrings gave her simple tank top outfit that extra little zing. She looked beautiful, so Rachel avoided looking at her. Instead she concentrated on the computer and silently wished for her friend to disappear. Oh, and she could take her candles with her. The strawberry smell was way too sweet...like being attacked by an army of Strawberry Shortcake dolls.

Late that night, I run across Morgan, Hays and a group of their friends several blocks from the park behind a luxury highrise apartment building. They recognize me. I stop, say hello and chat. One has an iPhone and asks me to take group photos of them. I take photos with my own camera and assure them that I will email them photos. I ask them direct questions about sex and drugs. They give me direct answers. Are we becoming friends now?

I always lay down the lightest color first, and color the whole image, ie. violet petal, then I go back and put down the darkest color, then the next darkest and blend the previous color in, I did flick the B28 on top of the BV08 then when I blended all of it with the BV31 I went over the B28 lightly. I hope that makes sense. I used C1 and C3 to go around the outside of the violets and leaves and I used nestabilities to cut out the oval and the mat. I'm not 100% happy with the way the colors turned out, what do you think?

We append the plea from the committee which was carried on Jukwaa, an online discussion forum that I founded in August 2005 and still administer. You will notice that a similar libelous story is carried on the Capital FM website in a link posted on Jukwaa as a response to our announcement:
Nathan Bransford asked for opinions last week about whether the query process worked. I said I thought it was probably better to have the agent read the first part of the manuscript before reading the query letter. Now I think I'm going to change my mind. I do think the query is important. But I think it works only when the writer takes the time to make the query truly reflect the work.

Because the kitchen is typically the most used room in the house, it's extremely important to ensure that it's organized and functional for all the action that it receives! This isn't always an easy task and often times takes some patience and planning! Which explains why I received the following question from a reader, along with many other's just like it:
Everyone will tell you that I’m the shy one of the group. I’m the one with the big smile and laugh, but usually only speaks when spoken to, with obvious exceptions. Sometimes when I do speak around a group of people, I feel like my voice isn’t heard. Maybe I talk at the wrong time. Maybe I’m ignored.

I also agreed with one critique that workerism was a form of pre-figurative politics: both come out of a mileau of 1930s Marxism that gets used in the 1960s “New Left’ in particularly problematic ways. There is an irony to a lot of the attacks on prefigurative politics as an anarchist delusion. However, I do not think Dr. Kliman actually argues for anything like workerism, and I think it would be foolish to attribute or “vanguard politics” to Dr. Kliman or Marxist Humanist Initiative.

Progressives erect a set of idealisations – what we are becoming, what we should think and how we should behave. Our human nature is fixed in the sense that we inherit genes, which give us our essence, but how we act it out or think is given form by our cultures and communities which themselves grew out of our collective psyches. We can not step outside what we are and where we belong. We are part of it and it is what makes us social beings.

The Mayor’s office was small but full of weird things. And Ashi thought the weirdest of them all was the head of a huge eagle-like bird that was as big as a cow’s. It was stuffed and displayed on the top of the Mayor’s chair. In front of the table were two chairs facing each other. Captain Kor was sitting behind the table while the two were on the front.

One day I started earlier than usual, so I thought I did not need to hurry. There were so many things to see in the woods that I forgot that dark was coming.

Little rabbits, you know, always have games together before they go to bed.

The people who designed the puzzle gameplay must hate the player because while fun it is very difficult. Certain parts of a level requires specific solutions based on a block moving techniques. You can easily block all progress by making the wrong move or if one of the various block types ruins your strategy completely. This is alleviated by letting you undo up to nine moves but only in easy and normal mode. Hard mode does not allow you to undo any moves and even the early levels are more difficult than most of normal mode. The camera is focused at the front of the tower but can be moved to view the sides but if you are moving along the backside then you are mostly if not completely out of sight.

In a large bowl place the meat, onion, parsley, and breadcrumbs. Mix well, then add the egg and a little seasoning of salt and pepper. Using your hands, combine everything together. If you are using chicken, you may have to add additional breadcrumbs because the ground chicken is usually very moist. Shape into meatballs. Delia Smith recommends meatballs small enough that you get 24 of them, and I aim for that. You can use a small ice cream scoop or cookie dough dropper if you have one that's the right size to portion the meatballs. The one I use has a 1-1/2-inch diameter. I believe it would be one that holds 1-1/2 tablespoons.

But then I started writing the beginning of my story. You know, the first 25%, the set-up. And I found myself adding certain details I hadn't intended. And I thought, shoot, that's pretty good, but if it's in the first couple of chapters in a novel, it's a promise to the reader. You just told them that these things are important. That you'll explore them further, that your audience will get to learn more. How in the world am I going to do that? Sure, I saw possibilities, but it veered so very far away from my little island off the coast of Africa.

Do you recall the “DC sniper” who terrorized the Washington, D.C. metro area in 2002? There were all kinds of theories concerning John Allen Muhammad who, along with a younger man, randomly killed people until finally being caught. In Scared Silent ($15.00, Atria Books, softcover) his former wife, Mildred Muhammad, reveals that the killings were part of his plan to ultimately kill her and make it appear she was just one of the sniper’s random victims despite the fact she was the mother of three of his children. This is on one level a story of domestic violence, but it is also a look at the twisted mind of a man who could have lived a normal life and threw it away as his rage overtook him. And it is a story of a woman unable to secure the help she needed from law enforcement authorities until too many people were dead. Criminal Minds: Sociopaths, Serial Killers & Other Deviants ($17.95, Wiley, softcover) is not light reading. Jeff Mariotte has written an authorized companion to the hit TV series, providing the stories behind serial killers such as David Berkowitz and Henry Lee Lucas, sexual predators, killers with famous victims, cannibals like Jeffrey Dahmer, traveling killers such as Ted Bundy, and a whole cast of quite loathsome lunatics. If that’s your cup of tea, this book will more than satisfy your interest. In A Peculiar Tribe of People: Murder in the Heart of Georgia ($24.95, Lyons Press) Richard Jay Hutto takes a close look at Chester Burge, described as a slumlord, liquor runner, and black sheep of a wealthy family. In early 1960 when his wife was murdered, suspicion fell on Chester and in the ensuing trial the quiet community of Macon was treated to a story of totally grotesque dimensions in which every social and sexual taboo was broken. The South of that era is the backdrop to the story. It makes for very compelling reading.
The inverted parallels to medieval European Christendom are obvious, but the questions this allegorical adventure tale raises are provocative and compelling.

Though I love pursuing my life as a creative writer, I find I too often get pulled into listening to other people's problems. I can literally spend hours a day helping people. I am happy to help, but then I feel drained, with little energy left after my day job to pour into my creative pursuits. Any words of wisdom?

Up until recently, my approach to public speaking tended to be more along the lines of "oh, yeah, I guess I probably will, if someone asks", so this new page is signifying a change in perspective. I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about the things I like doing, and how I could do them differently, as part of a last-ditch attempt to figure out ways to earn some money doing the things I actually enjoy doing, before surrendering completely to the idea of hunting for a real job. Some of this rethinking will not involve money, but money has been on my mind, as I've been thinking of how it relates to what I'm doing and want to do, which is something I never really did seriously before (I always seemed to have the mostly subconscious idea that the only way to really earn money was through far less fun ways, so those are always what I thought of when it came to money-earning).

H - No, but I'm sure that as we look more closely at these periods, our research will throw up ideas and themes that will influence the feel of the comic. I'm reminded of a comment that Mermaid left here on JB a few posts ago, about living in a time of change. The periods we've just listed were all times of immense turmoil. Did people living in these times, I wonder, have a clear understanding of just what they were living through? This quite fascinates me, this idea of how we view, and are viewed by, history. Will future generations look back on us, then, and wonder why we allowed so much bloodshed over religious ideas that are based on such antiquated texts? Or will we be the generation that finally breaks away from this? And if not us, then which generation will?

2. Start gambling- Word of your drunkenness has probably already started to spread in the office at this point. So the time before you get thrown out by security is limited. Hobble over to the water cooler, and invite some co-workers over to your cubicle for some poker. When they stare at you in disbelief, take a drunken bow, and say, “I’m in my prime.” But don’t bow too low, that you fall over. If that happens, simply say, “It appears my hypocrisy knows no bounds.” Then make your way back to your desk, and play on-line poker instead. You can yell things at the screen, and challenge invisible players to duels. It’s fun!
Ever since YA became "the thing" there's this assumption that just because you've written a great young adult character in a book the book has to be characterized as young adult. Not true. There are many fabulous works of fiction that have included well-written young adults, but would not be classified as young adult. One that pops into my head at the moment, or an author that pops into my head, is Jodi Picoult. Jodi regularly includes a character arc for a young adult character and often that character arc plays as strong of a role as the adult's arc, but never (to the best of my knowledge) have her books been classified as young adult. Part of that is that she doesn't have a young adult voice.

Ethics class, however, taught me something useful about myself. I push myself too hard. I really do. Of course, my nieces telling me that is being a good teacher for me, too. I need to stop, breathe, and realize… I’ve been through worse times. I can survive this too. School is not proving to be as hard as I thought, and I’m up for the challenge. What I am no longer up for is being responsible for the lives of those too sick or fragile to care of themselves. I just can’t do it. I can’t even pretend. That would be… unethical.

“Ideal” by whose standards? My ideal isn’t a big empty building, it’s an org packed with people, alive, excited, inspired. That’s the way I remember Orgs when I first got into Scientology in the late 1960s. We didn’t have fancy buildings. The old LA Org was a two-story house. The offices were cramped, the courserooms had bare concrete walls. But the place was electric.

Hidden is an outstanding piece of work from a band obviously loving playing together. The songs structures are important and these have jam-orientated roots, much like Fat Freddy’s Drop. The whole album feel like a major labour of love that has been born by the jam, honed and perfected live then polished in the studio. Instrumental albums need to have enough variety to sustain a listeners interest and JBN succeed with ease. UK dates are promised later in the year with the hope of some UK festival appearances in the future as well.

If there’s a part of scripture that best illustrates how Mormons twist the word of God, this is it. We have always maintained that Mormons are great basing an entire belief system upon one or two verses of scripture. This is a well known fact amongst those of us who work in the field of counter-cult ministries. The LDS Church is no exception to this rule, although they would vehemently deny the allegations. There is literally one verse that talks about baptism for the dead and this is what the Mormon Church has put their minds on to set a standard of a dead work for their god. It is found in 1 Corinthians 15:29 and it says; ‘Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?’

I want, more than anything, for America to understand that our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines, have the same beliefs and desires as other Americans. Only, they must remain silent and vigilant, in order to preserve the right of others to voice their opinions. A young man or woman deciding to serve should not be seen as some lack of humanity in their souls. On the contrary, they who serve have a deeper soul then most; and it must be deep because they must forever harbor and suppress those things they see and do that others were unwilling to commit to.
We all will hear many, many wonderful things about John, and we think many wonderful things about John, but any of you who have younger sisters, older brothers, know that it’s not always a perfect world when it comes to sibling relationships.

And when we were children sharing a room, our parents wisely chose to draw a line down the center of the room.

What makes Carr’s locked-room mystery so successful is the creation of an eerie, ghostly atmosphere. The Times observed that Carr is “superb at conveying sinister and scary atmosphere, verging on the supernatural.” Indeed hints of the spectral and the uncanny dominate the story. Professor Grimaud lives in an exotic Gothic-like house and tells his friends stories of witchcraft and old-world superstitions. His friend Pettis is a collector of ghost stories, and the murderer appears to be a ghostly figure who haunts his victims. The story of the three coffins, with its Transylvanian setting and characters rising from their graves, adds to the Gothic atmosphere of the novel. As Toshi points out, “The supernatural (or quasi-supernatural) functions, in Carr’s novels, as a sort of analogue to the locked room; it is really a variation of the ‘impossible’ crime – i. e., the crime that is shown ultimately not to be impossible” (1990, 124).

I really feel the 8×8 brooder pictured above was excellent for our purposes. The birds had room, fresh air, they were easy to access and safe from predators. But what do you do when you move to 300 chickens per batch? You move to the new greenhouse. I built a 2′ tall 4×4 brooder that the chicks can enter and exit under each side. There are four lamps inside on two switches so temperature regulation is easy.
There is a lot of tension between blacks and whites in America. I used to fear black people… with reason because, for example, black kids stole my bicycle (I saw them do it) and a year later, when I was 13, black kids mugged me in Central Park. I used to think that black people were not as smart as white people because whenever I spoke with them they seemed to have a hard time putting a sentence together.

The gradual displacement of blacks as America’s preferred minority is producing a powder keg of racial tension in Florida and elsewhere. So much so that even the normally wise Bill Cosby can’t quite come to terms with it. Cosby wants to think this is all about guns but it isn’t. It’s about race, Bill. And the wave of inter-racial violence in the wake of the Zimmerman release should have tipped you off.

Obama went to an openly anti-white, i.e. "racist", church. It certainly isn't beyond the bounds of discourse to bring this up and to question whether it disqualifies him from the presidency. Romney's case is a bit different, since he belongs to a large, organized religion that is more or less accepted within the mainstream of American culture. Nevertheless, many Americans, myself included, haven't failed to note the weirdness of many Mormon beliefs. Do these beliefs disqualify him from the presidency? Probably not, and not because the beliefs aren't strange or irrational. No, I think we just have to accept that many people hold weird beliefs that don't necessarily impinge upon their ability to think and act rationally in other areas.

While the cake was baking, I mixed 4 ounces of cream cheese in the mixer until fluffy and added 2 ounces of melted unsweetened chocolate. Next added 1/8 tsp salt and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.

I added more and more milk a tsp at a time until the consistency of the frosting was thin enough for me to pour but thick enough for it to hug the cake.

Upon arriving in New York and latching on to James St. James, Michael makes his first attempts at becoming a party promoter for a man named Peter Gatian (Dylan McDermott). Success isn’t the word I would use to describe his rise to fame, so much as “oops.” His bizarre antics and “superstar” projects like then boyfriend, DJ Keoki (Wilmer Valderama, That 70’s Show) and the hot mess, Christina Superstar (Marilyn Manson) are part of what catapulted him and his set into the public eye and onto The Geraldo Rivera Show. You see, the Club Kids made their livings by partying. Promoters, club owners and talk show hosts paid them obscene amounts of money just to show up.

This film deserves an audience just as much as Evil Things does. So consider this a clarion call: get out there and spread the word about this movie; call your local theater and demand that they book a screening; and most importantly, if it does come to your town, cancel all plans and buy a ticket! I promise you that you won't be disappointed.
I was writing papers back in the early 90s when I formed BT's devices research unit in which I then talked about co-operating devices which were excellent at what they individually do, rather than converged kludges which try to be a swiss army knife 'jack of all trades' but are inevitably a master of none. The reason I gave for my minority view then, although I couldn't have known it was exactly what Tim Cook said yesterday, that it is all about the user experience.

So, meet Eugene and Lucille. You may remember them from an earlier post. Well at that time they did not have names and it took me a heck of a long time to come up with them. These characters, Eugene and Lucille, are the beginnings of a much larger art work: an altered book/graphic novel idea I have.
I realize with a mix of frustration and relief this is the answer I looked for all day. The novel. I want everything else — the grading, the cleaning, the movie, the duties — to fall away and leave me dozens of hours to disappear into finishing this story. It’s frustrating because the timing is off. I budget time for fiction, but today’s hours were allotted to getting grades entered and I’m being bratty to complain about it. I’m lucky enough to be working only part-time this year, to have 3 days off for a workshop this week, to have 2 months home this summer between teaching. Wait, impatient novel. Your turn is coming.

Ghana has a love affair with soccer (football) and every little boy plays – dreaming of following the footsteps of the stars that have paved their way. Essien, Desailly, Pele, Gyan… the streets literally burst with glee during international matches when Ghana scores or wins – the din of the cheering can be heard across the nation and it’s a magical thing. Being in Ghana for the World Cup is an experience I’ll never forget. Truly amazing.
Memory. My memory is that my sister, Teri, and I always called that game Concentration. We played it with our best friend, Ginger. She lived next door, and Mom started babysitting Ginger when she and Teri were 2 months old. We were constant playmates as children, and best friends as teens. Teri and Ginger were best girlfriends as adults, and I considered Ginger a second sister.
Those days are long past. For the great majority of Americans, living standards have been declining since the early 1970s, upward mobility is increasingly a nostalgic dream, and it’s becoming harder even for government flacks to keep pretending that training prople for jobs that don’t exist will make those jobs miraculously appear. Ours is a contracting society, and outside of the narrowing circle of privilege—itself facing, a little further down the road, a far more drastic form of downward mobility—most people realize that hard work and prudence, the road to a better future in past generations, are merely a slightly slower road to impoverishment than the one everyone else seems to be taking.
Regardless, I've been treating the last few days as though he'll show up this weekend just to make sure the critical tasks are well in hand if Kate suddenly says it's time to go to the hospital. Some part of me thinks the thing to do in the final days of pre-fatherhood is to gorge on garbage food, see a lot of violent and/or sexually gratuitous movies and cram in as many domestic beer-drenched rock shows as I can.
I was thinking about this because it relates a lot to life. The sunny days are the ones in which we do what we should. We go after our dreams and push ahead no matter what is in front of us. But as always, those cloudy days come. Problem is, sometimes we get stuck in those cloudy days. We wallow, and sit around because we just don’t feel like doing anything that day. The world seems small when the clouds cover the skies and we begin to wonder if want to so anything.

Brooksyne’s Note: I really like to read the exciting and very intense life of Joseph from Genesis 37-50. Though I’ve known this story since childhood I never tire of re-reading it and being reminded of the importance of forgiveness and reconciliation. If anyone could be filled with worry and fear, certainly Joseph was a perfect candidate. But God had a plan for his life that could not be changed though he was abandoned, enslaved, framed, falsely imprisoned, and forgotten. God’s plan was not thwarted in the midst of all that would seem to indicate God had forgotten Joseph. But the scene was only setting up in slow motion for great drama and uncontrollable emotion as Joseph rose to second in command in his adopted country of Egypt. I’m so blessed in reading of Joseph’s perspective to the extremely difficult circumstances of his life over the previous twenty years when he said to his estranged brothers, “God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives….so then, it was not you who sent me here, but God” (Gen. 45:7,8). We, like Joseph, need to recognize that God is working behind the scenes in every circumstance of our life – whether it is the workplace, home, the church or any other uncomfortable matter that we are dealing with. If we want the spiritual maturity of Joseph we also must undergo the testings that brought him to such mature perspective. Ouch!

I really clicked and had good creative rapport with a girl I met there. We were chatting online a day or so later and she suggested we write a song.

Lightsabers, force fields, quantum leaps, and teleportation were all notable fancies of my youth, but what basis have they in reality? Kaku is a rare breed of physics guru: he is an excellent communicator and has flourished over the past decade as a writer. Here he breaks down these and other sci-fi technologies that we all know and love to give us hope for which ones might one day be realized.

I'm in Berlin right now shooting an ad campaign. Yesterday I met Claude, her name is Claudia but she hates that name. As you can see, Claude is a beautiful example of a young lady that knows how to play up her best assets. We cast her because she has the figure of a real, everyday girl: she stands about 5'1" and she is very curvy. You can't really appreciate her curves because of her coat, but they're there. It has actually been a little difficult to find samples that fit her correctly but really, who could get past her hair, lips and those legs? She knows that these are her best featues and works with us to find looks that suit her best.

Although In Winter’s Shadow is billed as the third in a trilogy, it could be read as a stand-alone. Readers who have read the previous two will recognise events and people from them, and will pick up references to earlier incidents, but the main elements of the back story are filled in as necessary. Arthurian trilogies sometimes seem to fade by Book 3 or to sag under the accumulated weight of legend, but not in this case. I thought In Winter’s Shadow was the strongest of the three novels by quite a margin.
In Villers-Bretonneux I sneaked into the Australian Memorial before the gendarmerie blocked the entrance, stealth camping behind the site ready for the dawn service. It was a cold morning, but luckily the rain held off. After studying the ANZAC myth at Sydney University I didn’t quite know what to expect at the ceremony; but the Australian and French speakers gave a moving and accurate portrayal of many personal experiences of the soldiers. I was particularly interested in the civic-religious rituals that took place, and I still remain perplexed at the annual ceremony. Historians had believed that the ceremony would just fizzle out like Empire Day had done, but the phenomenon only increases in popularity each year.
21. “Human” by Human League – Now that I’ve established that some of these lyrics are weak, allow me to present Exhibit B. I get a kick out of some of the justification I read when I look at some of these lyrics. What’s the excuse for cheating in this song? “I’m only human.” Well, now that you said that…

So – what happened to the official grievance against my boss? Well, Human Resources were really good. They listened. They sympathised. They couldn’t believe some of the nonsense that had been going on. They didn’t take sides – that’s not what they are there for. They explained at length about the grievance process.
8. The Amazing Spider-Man (July 3) – In a summer season chock full of superhero films that are poised to become mega-blockbusters, The Amazing Spider-Man is probably the biggest risk since it reboots the superhero franchise back to its origins. While Batman Begins did the same thing in the summer of 2005, the new Spider-Man arrives in theatres targeting the same audience who still are very familiar with Sam Raimi’s trilogy starring Toby McGuire and Kirsten Dunst. Since Raimi’s last turn with the webbed-slinger, the atrocious Spider-Man 3, left a bad taste in fans’ mouths, it’s anyone’s guess as to how the new reboot plays, but with stars Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone leading a supporting cast that includes Dennis Leary, Sally Field, Rhys Ifans, and Martin Sheen, Amazing Spider-Man definitely has the potential to restore audiences’ love for the red and blue web slinger.

The Leaf people produced a few Andrew Luck cards, using a picture of him at the 2008 U.S. Army All-American Bowl, a high school All-Star game. Luck’s people sent them a cease-and-desist letter, saying that they don’t have the legal right to profit from an image of Luck. The Leaf people say they do indeed have the right to use images from the All-American Bowl. Now they’re suing Luck.

I was able to sleep until 8:00 Wednesday morning. Everybody got out their little backpacking stoves and started heating up water. All I really cared about was my first cup of coffee. I poured my instant coffee packets into my cup and waited for my water to boil. Aaaah, boiling water to my rescue. Someone brought a camp stove also and the others were making eggs, potatoes and bacon. I brought a freeze-dried meal so once again waited moments for some boiling water. I was slightly disappointed in this meal so I ended up eating some fruit and a few mini powdered donuts. I was good to go.

Andrew Gow is the Ale Stars Tzar for the Sydney crowd and he is a bloke who is not only passionate about beer and brewing but communicates his knowledge and thoughts really well. He is also very capable of encouraging discussion and debate so those who attend will feel encouraged to participate rather than feel they are sitting in a classroom situation – a classroom where you have to drink beer, and where your homework will involve drinking more beer, but ... Interaction and discussion is what makes Ale Stars such a great night out. I was fortunate enough to have a good beer-chat with AG when he was down for an Ale Stars session late last year and I know he will bring a great vibe to the Darlo Ale Stars.
Now, one of the problems the online commentariat has with SOPA stems from the fact that the companies pushing for the law, such as big motion picture production companies, have deep pockets and are donating money to politicians. That has made for a big, fat, easy target set up in the faces of anarchically-minded web-naturals like Cory Doctorow, the fiction writer.

1. We fail at being girls: As if it wasn’t bad enough that we only had like three outfits each that we deemed “going out” worthy, it took us almost a full 45 minutes to decide which of these outfits we wanted to wear. It’s amazing how skinny jeans can cause such a problem.

His stated conclusions, based on his research and insight, will make many uncomfortable. He suggests that what religion perceives as “god” is really a type of “thoughtform” that has been created and modified over numerous millenia. I have some small knowledge of thoughtform creation, which affords me a much different view than most people. Not superior just different. Most who are adherents to some form of religion would be outraged to be told that each of us are capable of sending a piece of our astral matter to a distant location… and then reabsorbing it and reviewing what it saw and sensed, like a movie playing on the mind’s eye. And the inevitable reaction of being in league with “the devil” – by whatever name he’s called this month – is to be expected at some point, without fail. It is beyond most people’s experience, aside from the sleep period, where they are truly aware of who they are. That’s not a judgment, just an observation. I am extremely blessed to have some deeply spiritual people in my spiritual family who are also religious practitioners and have a found a way to blend religion with true spirituality. They are a gentle reminder to me that the deeds of its leaders or even individuals are not a true reflection of all in that belief system.
You cannot change your spouse. As much as you may want to, you cannot play God and reach into their heart and mould them into what you want them to be. It might surprise you, but that is exactly what most couples spend a large part of their time trying to do- change their spouse.

I love this phrase. Perhaps this was more true in “olden” days when a person was born and supposed to die as part of a certain class. i shudder to think what might have happened to me if born in that time. Reading a novel such as this reminds me how much things have changed and also how some of the old standards have survived.

The only real problem I’m having with Screnzy is the writing itself. The reason being that when I write a novel, I usually have at least most of the scenes and dialogue planned out. Not in a wrote-a-detailed-outline way, but in a daydreamed-about-it-in-my-head way. I visualize while doing the dishes at work or driving. But with this script, I have done very little visualizing, which is probably a bad thing since scripts are extremely visual. So I keep getting stuck because, although I know what’s happening, I don’t know how it’s happening – I don’t have a clear idea of what the setting looks like, how the characters are interacting, or what the characters are saying. But I think that’s a personal problem.

Usually accompanied with sharp edges and angular traits, faces that are equally wide and long are called square faces. We would recommend going for more flowing, rounder frames in choice of sunglasses (or eyeglasses for that matter), this will take away some of the harshness that the angular traits present and make the face look curvier.

However, it’s clear with the One S that HTC spent time on design and build quality. The phone is super thin with a .37-inch waistline and weighs in at just 4.22 ounces. I usually don’t spend a lot of time talking about weight and dimensions because most phones are actually quite similar in that respect, but HTC hit the nail right on the head with the One S. Here’s why: if a phone is too thin, and thus too light, it begins to feel cheap — especially when it’s made entirely from plastic.

I just saw a profile online that says "The best revenge is to smile, be happy and never let them know they hurt you". So the question is...do you strive to hide the hurt or to get over it? Forgiveness can be very hard to come by and sometimes it is even harder to give. How magnanimous can you be when your heart has been ripped out? It is one thing to forgive a child for a mistake, it is harder to forgive an adult, whether it was a mistake or done on purpose.

But after watching our kids play with these things for over an hour without growing bored or wanting to do something else, I think that they see the value in this kind of word-of-mouth marketing. I figured that I was sent at least $400 worth of product, if not more, and each guest left with over $30 worth of product to keep. , including 3 of their own Nano Hexbug Robots. But for the cost of sending out that kit to me, I think that company gained 10 new customers.
Our view has always been that oil prices would fall anyway given the deteriorating prospects for demand and the likelihood that some OPEC members, led by Saudi, would raise output regardless of the formal ceilings. Overall, the result on Thursday was fresh falls in equities and commodity prices, and in safe haven government bond yields, with the dollar regaining ground. We expect more of the same over the rest of the year, consistent with our view that the US S&P 500 will hit 1200; Brent crude will be back below $90pb.

One of the church's leaders had just lost his mother that day, and the pastor implored us to meditate on this verse. Among Russian Orthodox believers there is a practice of praying for the Lord's mercy on the spirit of the dead, as it passes through the journey to its final destination. But the Lord wants to meet with us in this life. It is here where we make our decision, and if we choose life, He will still be our God...not the Lord over our dead bodies, but the Lord of our new, eternal flesh.

7. When I was about seven, I hatched a plan to have a hundred children, name them all after flowers, and spend my afternoons making industrial quantities of toffee apples. Fortunately, no part of this plan seems likely to come to pass, though some of the flower names were pretty special. Ranunculus Harlot has a certain je ne sais quoi.
Recently, Street Fight, which focuses on hyperlocal content and commerce, conducted research with select local small businesses. The upshot?

Today I had the can of paint on the bathroom sink and I was standing on the side of the tub trying to paint around the ceiling. I had a chair in between me and the sink so I could just step around to make things easier. I stepped on the chair with one foot to reach the paint can and for some reason the chair slid, thus causing me to do the splits. I am sure even when I was a baby that I could not do the splits. I am not genetically built for them. My sister tried forcing me once which, quite frankly, I was lucky I could still have children afterwards. Anyway, as the chair slid I felt the muscles pulling in places that no woman wants muscles pulling. My daughter and husband was on the other side of the house discussing bikes and handlebar tape. I yelled for help, groaned for help, prayed for help. No one came. I managed to grab on to something and get myself pulled back together. I had a flashback to when I was 24 months pregnant with my youngest son (not really, but it felt like 24 months), I went to kick a ball and missed. Couldn’t walk for weeks from a pulled groin.
I really loved her. It came with understanding that she had issues, and while I couldn’t bare the brunt of the flare ups, and no matter how many times I wanted to just walk away, I would always have a soft spot in my heart for her. I hated to see her this way.

I wrote this piece, not only because I recently read about the internally displaced Ethiopians, but also because in the past, in the 1990s, my family and many other families too had gone through a similar experience—we were forced to leave the small village we lived in and we had to migrate to a small town where I grew up later on; back then, there was no intense media coverage like today, so our case was hardly known; the federal government was aware of it, but they buried it for the sake of stability because if people in other parts of the country had found out, it could have had a very negative effect. The country was already fragile at that time. Our displacement happened soon after the collapse of the military regime.

Viewed simply, the vessel has a cylindrical body section, to which on the bottom is welded a hemispherical lower head. The upper head must be removable to allow for refueling or other work inside the reactor vessel; thus, it is bolted to the rest of the reactor vessel. Penetrations for entry of the control rod extensions and instrumentation are obvious. The vessel was roughly 32 feet 6 inches high, 10 feet 6 inches in diameter. The internal height was 375 inches (31 feet 3 inches) and the internal diameter was 109 inches (9 feet 1 inch.) The nominal thickness of the barrel section or wall was 8-3/8 inches.

She was sympathetic once she’d stopped laughing and realised that I was serious. She’d said that she hadn’t noticed before but on closer inspection, all was evident. She gave me some advice on what the possibilities were and again, ‘false ones’ were mentioned.
So far, this sounds good. However, there is a major, major problem. I’m going to compare what IC is doing to an analogy that I thought of this past summer when I was Uganda thinking about this issue. Imagine that today you heard about what happened in NYC and Washington DC on September 11, 2001 for the first time. You were shown a video of footage from that day. You saw the planes hit the towers, you heard President Bush’s address, you saw the Pentagon wreckage, you watch in horror as you see people plunge to their death, jumping from the burning towers. Now imagine that you are inspired by this disaster. You want to something to help. What if you went to NYC today, expecting to see piles of rubble to clean up? What if you went, expecting that there would be thousands of people in the streets crying, looking for loved ones? But what would happen when you arrived and discovered that there was none of this, but a whole host of other problems?

At the time we were in Ireland, they were still recovering from unusually cold and snowy weather. Much of the country had experienced a freeze. Because it was an uncommon occurrence in the country, pipes froze and then burst once the thaws hit. Many towns and cities experienced a loss of water and a water curfew ensued for several days. The worst that we were personally hit was the day we were in Cashel. Everywhere we went looking for facilities, we were told "we have no water". You know, that's a little tough on someone who drinks just a few too many Diet Cokes (not me, mind you. Blech). Don't tell anyone, but one member of our little party had to desecrate the grounds of a national historic site. Couldn't be helped. Good thing the weather and the lack water kept most people indoors that day!

I took my friends (husbands were busy unfortunately) who were visiting from Okinawa, Japan to Seribu Rasa, an Indonesian Restaurant, about which I have heard many great reviews from my friends. Once you step inside, you forget that you’re in the middle of the busy central district of Jakarta. Seribu means “thousand” and rasa means “taste”. The restaurant had a beautiful ambiance. It was a Tuesday night, but the restaurant was still packed. There were many Indonesian as well as foreign customers.

Telugu superstar Ram Charan Teja is all set to make his Bollywood debut with the 2012 version of Zanjeer, opposite one of B-town’s highest paid actresses, Priyanka Chopra. And to peeve the fans of Charan, speculations about PC being paid more than their star was enough. And as expected, rumours are afloat about his Telugu fans being upset and wanting to make it clear that Charan flies high with a 12 crore remuneration, and PC lags behind with a reported 5.5 crore price tag.

I have yet to find a cookbook from Basilicata! My Calabria with its emphasis on olive oil, spicy peppers, bitter greens, polenta and sheep's cheese has been the closest I could find to my grandmother's cooking. The lure of My Calabria is not just the recipes (once considered "poor cooking" is now lauded - what goes around... ) and the recipes do beckon - but the journey of how the Calabrese through mean circumstances and foraging developed a delicious cuisine that could not have happened anywhere else would draw in any food-lover. The recipes for jarring and canning are a bonus - in true form - they wasted nothing.

So I understand when someone says to me that they have no idea what food is in season or how they would plan a meal around only what is in season. And it is no surprise to me that in the past I have occassionally lost a CSA ( Community Supported Agriculture) subscriber because they have found it difficult to do justice to the food in the boxes each week. So my plan is to enclose a suggested menu, and a recipe to help them get the most from their box of food. Here's the one for this week!
Do you agree that Wikipedia’s rankings are fair? And lets face it, even if they’re not (unless you’re Google of course) what can we do about it other than try and compete. We might as well try and learn something from the site’s huge success of user-generated content creation and find out how we can use it to strengthen our own sites.
There was one point – where I was explaining how funny and/or disgusting sexual relations are – of all kinds – not just the cringy older-man-sex like the kind I was ostensibly offering the seemingly-innocent 24-year-old Josie Long acolyte – Josie Long – the oh-so-correct comic whom the woman oddly hadn’t heard of – all the while I was stroking the hair of the middle-aged man and touching the knee of 30ish non-gay Government employee bloke – it was so uncomfortable that I started laughing so hard I had to kneel down – gasping for air and life.
Days like today are the reason I present at those wedding shows. I get to meet brides, hear about their wedding dreams, talk about music (and dresses and flowers)...and then I get to add the sound of my harp to it all, like lying down a soundtrack for their romance. Happy day.
Animals kill their young if they are left unprotected at times but then will risk their own lives trying to defend them as well. People will justify their sexuality or sexual practices off behaviors found in the wild, but then recoil in shock when china was killing babies since they were not male. Some animals mate for life and others jump from partner to partner. Packs will kick out those members who are not following the rules of the hierarchy and other times you will see a coup in leadership as a stronger member takes over control.
Her first step is to go to this night club called The Boiler Room and just ask around if anyone has seen a pretty girl. What, does she expect the bartender to just point her in a random direction and go “there’s the only pretty girl in the entire bar”? I guess she did, because that’s what happens, and the black haired goth-chick from before tells her no dice. So Joey’s response is to go home and have a contrived flashback dream that serves no purpose at all, except a rather empty scare way later in the movie:

Jesus speaks into your routine in two ways: first, the written Word of God, Scripture, sometimes called logos. The second is your personal revelation from God through the Holy Spirit, rhema. It is insight for living, straight from God’s heart to your own. It may be an “ah-ha moment” as you read Scripture, an unexpected mental image, a sudden urge to act or a gentle impression.

These matters (especially) raise serious questions – not only in regard to the morality of the activities of groups such as Searchlight, but also the legality of their actions. No doubt these are matters that others, more familiar with criminal law, may wish to pursue.

Satan, of course, wanted to foil Gods plan. Christ could not pay for the sins of mankind, if he sinned himself. So, Satan’s first plan of attack was to tempt, trick, and torment Jesus into sin. Jesus stood firm, and did not sin. With time growing short, Satan realized that his only option left was to kill the Son of God, and by killing him, having victory over Christ, and God’s plan for mankind.

Another drenching storm had passed when, last weekend, we drove up the steep and winding road to the great white house atop a mountain in North Carolina. A weekend house filled with elegantly dressed people invited to meet two of the the Million Dollar Decorators, and from which the mist-softened panorama of the wooded slopes of the Appalachians came as such a beautiful surprise. To stand, even for a few minutes, under a sky no longer ominous but still flickering with lightening, deaf to all around and looking at a view so rare, was the most invigorating of moments.

1. Since we celebrated Easter yesterday, I thought I would start with the fact that when I was young I was once owned by a resurrected cat. (Side note: If you know anything about cats, you know you don’t own cats. Cats own you.) Her name was Spook. She was a long-haired calico cat with a Hitler moustache. Her favorite pastimes were sitting in the crook of a tree like a koala bear and reproducing. (Not at the same time.) Since her mother, Angel, had already populated our portion of Anderson County with kittens, we decided to get Spook “fixed.” Spook, living up to her name, managed to pull off an escape from the vet’s office shortly after surgery. We searched and searched for her, to no avail. My heart was broken. Not long after that, my mother was driving along the highway the ran between the vet’s office and our house. She spotted the body of a cat that had been hit in the middle of the road. It looked like Spook. Remember – she was a unique looking long-haired calico with a Hitler moustache. Not as common as, say, a yellow tabby. She stopped the car on the side of the road, walked to a nearby house to borrow a trash bag and a shovel, scooped the cat off the road, and brought it home for a proper burial. (Another note: My mother is not a fan of cats. She is a fan of her kids, however, which gives you an indication of how much my heart had been broken.) A week or so after the burial, I went be-bopping out our back door, probably to shoot baskets or something, and there in our garage was Spook, in the flesh (um, fur), meowing and hungry. I guess she worked up an appetite getting resurrected and all.

Enough pettiness. This holy well is unbelievably scenic. Sheep all over the hills surrounding it. The tour busses in Sligo drop their passengers off at another, way, way less impressive holy well that is all built up with Stations of the Cross and benches and video cameras hidden in the trees to catch petty thieves. St. Patrick's holy well in Dromard has been there long, long before he turned up in Ireland. I am sure this well has heard everything by now. Petty things and tragic things.
I love the way David prays! He cries for deliverance, and doesn’t wait for it to come about before thanking God for it. His faith allows him to express thanks before his prayer is answered. He trusts his Deliverer. Psalm 54 demonstrates this, and so do so many other prayers of David. Verse 4 is a great representation of the assurance that allows David to pray this way, and it is a great affirmation to include in my own prayers:
He stared at her, and it was a moment before he realised his mouth was hanging open. He closed it. Blandly interested, Taslin looked on, her regard heating his cheeks yet again. Rel reached up a hand to the back of his neck, tugged at his collar, conscious of the damp chill of beading sweat. There was a childishness to Dora that he didn't remember even from when she was still a child.
I of course have been thinking back to the time I was pregnant for the first time, carrying Baby Dazz’s mom and counting the days until I could meet her for the first time. Way back then, we chose not to find out the sex of the baby and so had to wait until she made her appearance to hear, “It’s a girl!” I had a secret hunch all along though that I was having a girl. Couldn’t tell you why, but something inside me just knew.

The other items were smaller, but one was particulary exciting. I found a small box of Johnson Brothers Ironstone!

Currently, activities such as smoking and the excessive consumption of fast food are risky, but only in the sense that their continuation gradually increases the risk of contracting disease or illness. The advances medical treatment that accompany negligible senescence can be expected to reverse the risk associated with these activities. As a result, although we may become more isolated, timid, stay-at-home beings, we can at least smoke and eat to fill the emotional void in our lives.

Who wouldn’t like fresh cookie smell? Or pumpkin pie smell? Or laundry smell? Or Christmas Tree? The thing is if you have a bunch of good smelling candles lying around, at some point, you’ll end up lighting one up before sex, or, on the opposite side of the spectrum after taking a huge dump. And given how connected smell is to memory, over time, the given smell will act as a trigger. Which means that this particular smell will either make you pop a boner or completely relax your colon, neither of which are very desirable when you are standing at ‘Mrs Fields’ at the mall, or cutting down the Griswold family Christmas tree, or eating dessert with the In-Laws, or folding clothes, and so on and so forth. If you are female, replace ‘pop a boner’ with the female equivalent.
We ended up going back to Jack’s bungalow (we meaning Jack and I) and we snuggled and had good sex (which I’ve been sorely missing) but the condom broke, which was terribly unfortunate and worries me a bit. (2011 update: As it turns out, I was in the clear! Woo hoo!)

She marks off time on her calendar.It pains me. She gets things in the mail. Identity theft. She’s nothing more than a social security number.Her things and numbers. She may as well have died years ago. Taxes and debt that are not hers.It seems I don’t exist in my own house. My siblings live off of my identity too, and claim my address, yet I have no claim to my residence. They’ve always been freeloaders.
But then we saw a Sony HD video camera that takes memory cards (that's right, no tapes!) and plugs right into the computer, etc. It was substantially better than what we currently own. By a lot. The regular price of this item? $400.
I think the sooner we start remembering our roots, reminding ourselves that we are all on the same level without Jesus, we will have compassion, love ALL people and share the good news of Jesus in a different way.

Feeling the opportunity to call out all these liberal hate-mongers on their poor grammar and excessive use of the F-word, the S-word, and the J-word, Pete responded by calling out the fools. The comments, he postulated, were a perfect example of liberal “intellectualism.” IE, liberals are rich, elite snobs with degrees in things, and yet can only swear and speak in sentence fragments. The research Pete conducted is highly suspect, since it is assumed it was all gleaned from comments left on his blog. On his side, though, several prominent liberals, leftists, philosophers and progressive innovators did identify themselves in the comments. For instance, a comment that read “fuck you, you fucking fuckety fuck, fuck. Nuts, twat, balls, Jon Stewart, First Amendment.” Was written by someone identifying themself as “Nobel Peace Prize Winner Jimmy Carter, and this is the greatest thing I have ever written.”

The study of the lives of those who have gone before us is a wonderful way to create perspective, and to understand the impact of our actions. Reading Christian biographies is a fantastic way to see God at work in the lives of others. I’ve listed four of my favorite middle grade and YA series in True Heroes.

Taylor’s family might not be the closest-knit – everyone is a little too busy and overscheduled – but for the most part, they get along fine. Then they get news that changes everything: Her father has pancreatic cancer, and it’s stage four – meaning that there is basically nothing to be done. Her parents decide that the family will spend his last months together at their old summerhouse in the Pocono Mountains.

The shimmers in this eyeshadow are a lot less evident. Rather than being able to see individual glitter particles, this shadow has an overall sheen to it. Very very beautiful. I used this eyeshadow on the outer half of my bottom lid for my spring inspired look. It is just so girly and pink! A perfect pink for me, in my opinion. You can use it sparingly to have a more baby pink shade, or you can load up that brush and achieve a more hot pink!

Once we made it to the edge of the campus, my feet on the paved road that could take me out of there... I had no idea if I should go left or right. I didn't even know where I was, or even what State I was in for that matter. In retrospect, yes, I could have taken off running ... but Amy was still holding my hand, and the DP, Kelly, had taken my other one. In fact ALL the girls were holding each others hands as we collectively crossed the street. Man, "Officer Friendly" would have been pleased as punch to witness that sort of caution while crossing a street.

But so so peaceful. After our traditional yuzeki dinner of around 15 small courses in three times the bowls (I hope these people have dishwashers), there was nothing else to do but sleep. Our personal kimono-clad woman put out our futons, rice pillows and duvet covers and we slept from 8:30pm to 7:30am. I can't remember the last time Lancelot and I went to bed before 11pm. It was bliss.
Well, this past Sunday was 7 months. 7 months since she's been gone. That point is coming where she has been dead longer then alive. She lived for an entire 7 months and 15 days. I'm not sure why this 'milestone' ways so heavily on my heart. More then Mother's Day or even Easter. I dread this day more then I even dread her first angel-versary. Mostly I think because it signifies time lost. It means we have begun to make more memories in her death then in her life. That is what pains me most. I will have more memories of going to her gravesite, of sending balloons to heaven, of sitting in her room trying to imagine her still there.. then I will of actual feasible memories of her. I won't get to see her first steps, her first day of school. I'm only left with my imagination. And now that it comes that she's been gone longer then she was alive.. I am forced to realize the reality of my life.

The Mayors had "Thee Interview" with Steve Rose last night and this has been critiqued/re-hashed by Tony's KC and Prime Buzz among others. Steve Rose has tempered with age, absolutely no hard questions or attitude that one usually gets from him. It's reassuring to know that Independence and Olathe are such big fan bases for the Mayors - they can't vote and don't pay property taxes and probably little in sales tax in KC so their voice is critical to KC's business. All we can say is - it's mortifying.
I am a consistent hand washer, so my hands get extremely dry and the tips of my fingers crack from excessive hand washing. I needed something to help smooth away that dry feeling, and I found it in the Vitamin & Cream lotion. It gave my fingers just what they needed, some TLC and left them feeling so soft! I also use this as a facial moisturizer, the Vitamin E really makes my skin glow and also makes it extremely soft and smooth. I really like how it doesn't leave a greasy feeling when you apply it and rubs in wonderfully. This works wonderful after shower time to keep your skin feeling smooth and soft all day long.
This year, I chose to semi-theme my participation in the A to Z Challenge. I mainly focused on motherhood, marriage, and how each can intertwine with writing. It was a great time for me to remember events in my 20-year marriage that I'd forgotten about. I also found myself letting go of some mother-stresses to focus on the joy motherhood has brought me.
Um, hey. Yes, it does. First of all, who said he wouldn’t marry the girl first? And if he doesn’t…and they’re teens…perhaps remaining unmarried will give the woman and her baby insurance coverage through her parents that she would be unable to get if married.

Now that India asserts its strategic interests independent of the United States and Israel, with the other members of the group called BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), it faces a trial of strength. The outcome will depend on whether Delhi can establish its capacity to turn away from what look like instant gains, and promises for future, to secure its long-term interests that are essential for India’s place on the world stage.
But I kept walking straight, because it wasn’t going to be alright. I let her snap off behind me like a slingshot, out into the dusty broken-down distance, to a place I wouldn’t ever have to see or live in, because for some unknowable reason I was born here and she was born there, and that was a fact not made better by unwanted charity or free cheeseburgers. I bought a bag of oranges for myself instead and peeled one as I drove home. They smelled sweet and fresh, like forgiveness from a beautiful but dying world.
11 I Believe in a Thing Called Love
In late January, I was on a business trip to east Texas. If you have never been there, let me say that east Texas is not, in general, an area of great economic diversity and wealth. Far from it, in fact; in many ways, that part of the country is one of the poorest I have ever encountered. As I was driving along a lonely stretch of road between Dallas and my destination, I passed a sight that I will never forget. There was a trailer park by the side of the road. There were several sheriff's cars and a large tow truck with a flatbed, and it was clear that they were there to repossess a dilapidated mobile home. The family was crying, wailing really, as they sat on the dirt next to a small pile of their remaining possessions. There were many other families gathered around, all Black, trying to console their neighbors, trying to reason with the repo man, and, I can assume, trying to figure out where they fit in to this heartbreaking situation. I was struck by this scene for many weeks afterward, trying to make some sense of what I had seen.
Have a Blessed week.

I never had any with my first pregnancy, or at least none that I could tell. The close personal relationship with these things came with my second pregnancy. I started getting them at about 34 weeks. They started infrequently and not very regular, but by 36 weeks they had started to come every second day, 5 minutes apart like clock work. I know 36 weeks is too early to have a baby, but it's not unheard of so I was a little worried that this was a sign that I was starting to get ready for the delivery, especially since with my first birth my body didn't mess around. When I had uterine activity it was b/c I was in labour. After about a week of sitting there timing "contractions" day after day I asked (begged) my dr. to do a cervical check. Thankfully he reported that no there was no change in my cervix, but did request weekly NST's (non stress tests) at the hospital from that point on. He wanted to make sure baby was still happy in there with all the activity going on. The news that no I wasn't delivering this child yet allowed me to go another couple weeks not focusing on these annoying, but useless contractions and just live my life. Ignoring them was easier said then done since they were still coming every 5 minutes apart 12 hours at a time and would take my breath away with every one. Finally at about 38 1/2 weeks I thought for sure I was in labour. The braxton hicks were getting stronger and they were so frequent that I figured they HAD to be doing something. My mom works in maternity so that evening when she was working I slipped into the hospital to get her to check everything out. They started out with the NST and based on the contractions it looked like I was in the early stages of labour. There was a lot of activity, but after getting her co-worker to check my cervix they gave me the news that not only was I not softened, dilated or effaced, but they couldn't even reach my cervix yet! It was still posterior!! I couldn't believe it!! I only had 1 1/2 weeks until my due date and although I was still enjoying being pregnant, sleeping well, completely comfortable, I was just flabbergasted that nothing was happening! To make a long story short I continued to have these braxton hicks until the day my dr. stripped my membranes. I was barely even one cm. dilated at that point, but at least my body was getting something done. That membrane strip put an end to the braxton hicks for a whole day and at 7pm I got my first real contraction of the pregnancy. I went into the hospital at about 12:30am and delivered my 2nd baby girl at 3:25am (3 days early!). I have to say it was a beautiful labour and delivery. I remember it with such fondness and I honestly can't wait to do it again.

After returning, we took my daughter out to eat at a local restaurant, as I hadn't seen her in a full week. As we were paying at the register, a childhood friend of mine wandered up to pay for her meal. This girl, D, is a couple years younger than me, and the daughter of a church family that my family used to spend a lot of time with when I was very young. I've known her pretty much my whole life, although we were never really close at all. Still, for some reason, bumping into her always brings a smile to my face.

So Christina, here is a piece of advice for you… If you want to look and behave like a true Parisian, don’t stare at Madame Eiffel. But do go visit her late at night and wait for the 20 000 lights to come off, around 2 AM, it's quite magical to say "bonne nuit" to the Eiffel Tower. Also, go get yourself an ice cream cone at Berthillon, my favorite ice cream shop in the city or a Nutella crepe made right in front of you Rue de Caumartin. And block a day to visit the Marais, my favorite quarter in Paris. Tiny paved streets with independent clothing designer shops or interior design concept stores. And of course, have a croissant every morning. Calories don’t count while you’re in Paris! Bon voyage!
And I have to say that this is one of those lines which seemed so profound to me the first time round, but when I really examine it now (and try to tie it in with the story) I'm not at all sure what it means.

For many like me, raised up in the old United States our lives seemed predestined to be one of special considerations and near endless possibilities. My dad’s career as a high-speed attorney and my mom’s as a pediatric surgeon meant I saw nothing even approaching hardship as a child. To the best of their ability, they tried to impart a realization on me that other Americans were not so lucky but I was young and despite my parent’s best efforts more a product of an affluent culture than anything else.

The reason I love this square so much is that it feels like Victorian London, be it the posh bit, is still weirdly living and breathing there. The area doesn’t seem to have changed and still has a certain atmosphere. If I could ever afford to live anywhere I could then I think it would be Bedford Square. Anyway the reason I was there was to meet Alice at Bloomsbury! I couldn’t actually believe that I have been emailing Alice for about five years and I had never met her before, and I even lived in London for a few years of the correspondence, shocking. We had a lovely brew and discussed lots and lots of bookish bits and bobs, both projects coming from me and titles coming from Bloomsbury. I also laughed when I discovered Alice knows me so well, she has speedily discovered ‘hmmm, I am quite busy at the moment’ means ‘I have absolutely no desire to read that but am too polite to say, thanks anyway’ – we both giggled about this as I was unaware, till she pointed it out, that I did it. It was too soon time to leave but I did manage to take some books, just a few…
Sometimes visitations are made in times of stress. This may mean that the departed person knows the person is going through life-altering transitions and wants to let them know they are not alone. The connection between the two may have been so strong that when one was upset, the other was upset as well. Therefore, when they visit to let it be known that they are still with them this is a sign that you are not handling everything by yourself.

The boys were all in the army or navy, except for Pat and Hugh. Pat had meningitis as a baby and was developmentally disabled from then on. I remember my dad was always bundling up his clothes into boxes and shipping them back home for Pat. Pat died some time in the late 1970s, but I did get the chance to meet him once when we went overseas as a family in 1977. He was always in great admiration of my dad—the great man who’d made it big in Canada.
Thanks to a combination of social, cultural, political and environmental pressures, young people in this country have been effectively estranged from Englishness, severed from the civilizing structures that bolstered their ancestors.

I have a lot of mugs! The cupboard is overflowing. I have them stacked in the back. I find a nice mug I have to have it! Actually, the last one I wanted (about 2 weeks ago!) I saw when I was out shopping with mum. It was all of $2 but I couldn't bring another mug home. So I got her to buy it for me to use at her house. I would have nearly been in trouble if I dared put another in the cupboard. It isn't that I collect them. It's just a cheap way often to buy something pretty. Like the one in this pic, I have a few with dogs on. But my dog love of mugs is waning as there are so many others out there. Also a lot of them are broken so I have less. More that break, the more room for new ones! I guess I will need lots once the boys start doing the dishes!

Many people reply that we are part of nature and part of the planet and have the same right to live on the Earth as other animals. In an ideal world, with much fewer people, living in balance with nature, perhaps that would be the case. But we do not help preserve any natural balance; we do not provide anything that other plants or animals in a natural setting need for survival. Ultimately, the animals and the natural environment would be far better off with fewer or no human inhabitants.

Another disturbing development in 2011 was a decline in press freedom in several well-established democracies, most notably Chile and Hungary. As a result of status downgrades in a number of previously Free countries over the past few years, the proportion of the global population that enjoys a Free press has fallen to its lowest level in over a decade. The report found that only 14.5 percent of the world’s people—or roughly one in six—live in countries where coverage of political news is robust, the safety of journalists is guaranteed, state intrusion in media affairs is minimal, and the press is not subject to onerous legal or economic pressures. Deterioration was also seen in a number of Partly Free media environments, such as Ecuador, Macedonia, Malawi, Uganda, and Ukraine.

So it may be that when these areas have these sounds, that kind of sound, it may be that what’s happening is that you’re tuning in to the psychic frequency of the super spectrum and you’re literally hearing the thoughts of millions of people.

No words ever evoke such memories of childhood for me as do these two words. My parents are both from West Virginia and the same holler. My Dad moved the family out to California before I was born and later the family would relocate in South Carolina and Florida, but the one place where I always felt at home and had an amazing sense of belonging , was in that holler. Every summer we would go back and the country roads would still be there. The grand parents and Aunts and Uncles with the many cousins would all be there, seemingly as if time had stood still in my absence and now the art of real living would begin for me anew after my a long delay.

In 1984, Prefab Sprout released their debut album Swoon which drew comparisons with Aztec Camera and Steely Dan. An instant critical favourite, the album hit #22 in the UK and the band quickly followed this up with a new single, When Love Breaks Down, a more commercial, lush affair which stalled at #88 in the chart. However, despite a couple more underachieving singles with Faron Young and Appetite, the band released their second album, Steve McQueen, in 1985 to even greater reviews than the first. The album hit #21 and When Love Breaks Down was granted a re-release. The single this time broke into the Top 40 at still a surprisingly low #25 and remains a radio classic to this day. Real Life... was featured as a bonus track on the 12" re-release. A successful career followed for the next two decades, with Paddy McAloon becoming an in-demand songwriter for artists as diverse as Kylie Minogue, Momus and Jimmy Nail. Ill health has blighted McAloon in recent years but 2009 saw the release of a new Sprout album, Let's Change The World With Music, recorded in 1993.

Although in some ways I can identify with “charismatics” within the church, I can’t identify with the love for Watchman Nee’s (as great a teacher as he was) teaching of soul and spirit, so that he ends up making soul something of the flesh in a sinful way, while spirit is what is attuned to God, and meets God. If that is the case, then much of what we read in the psalms, considered the Hebrew prayer book as well as song book, we can dump. But that is not the case. The psalms are written to encourage us to pour out our hearts to God, to come to him just as we are, to find his salvation ongoing in our lives. Indeed a part of what we need day after day.

Less altruistically such a reorganisation would reduce the number of councillors, thereby harming the political parties campaigning 'ground troops' and their capability to fight national elections. In the light of the rise of the career politics in Wales, these council seats also form a step on the political ladder for career politicians.

Sure, Jeremy runs his own business and he can make big decisions that reverberate around his industry, but in any company there are always teams of people whom others would love to join if they could. When you encourage more than the minimum from those who work for you, you raise the risk of failure but you also create much more meaning in their success.

Let cookies rest on tray for 5 minutes then remove to cooling rack. Store in an airtight container. Because of the crushed candy in these, they do get harder than the normal cookie as they cool, but they still keep a rather chewy texture. I definitely recommend underbaking rather than overbaking them.

They are as mean spirited as they are dangerous, and their dishonesty is massive, they call us “fascists”, yet, anyone watching their behaviour and that of the baying boot boy thugs outside Manchester town hall attempting, unsuccessfully, to prevent Griffin attending the count, would have little difficulty in determining who the true Nazis are. However, it is not only their dishonesty which is massive, their malevolence knows no bounds, and we ignore that at our peril.

We have to build a "Nation," we have to invest ourselves with "Nationalism." "Right," "Left," "Progressive," "Conservative," etc, must become as meaningless words to us. Politics has divided us, kept us separated and hindered us from reaching the true potential we could reach. We must reject the dogma of modern political theory and delve deep into our pagan and heathen ways. There are pagans who have inserted their progressive and leftist views into their teachings, seeking to undo the harm Christianity has done without bothering to learn what is actually Christian in origin and what is originally pagan. Too often, heathens have imparted ways of the right, though not as bad as they could have. Still, we have let politics keep us at each others throats, when we should have been reaching for hands in kinship. We have to move past this, to stop calling the other sides ignorant and shallow. It is our diversity which will help us to move forwards and deal with problems, but not unless we can realize we have more in common with each other than against each other.

By a strange coincidence, their home is just around the corner from where I almost bought a block of land in the early 70's. The asking price back then was under $2000 and a reasonable home would have cost $8000 to $10000 to build.

But my favorite quote of all is this one. I read it while I was chasing all the wrong guys and wearing myself out and derailing my self-esteem in the process. It totally helped me to remember that there is nothing shameful with working my heart out, following my bliss and wanting a mate who will get that and (gasp!) maybe celebrate it.

I wanted to take a time out from school, as I had finished my Bachelor’s but was almost certain I wanted to get it on with my Master’s. New York seemed like the right place to go to get my head straight after the stressful student years, to experience an adventure, and to distract my mind from the rigid system in Germany. I had planned on being away for six months to a year – max. That did not work out as planned…

I’ve also played with a lot of mandala coloring pages over the years…I even use to try and draw out mandalas that I saw in my mind’s eye during meditations. I studied the archetypal meanings behind mandalas during my college years. But I’ve never sat down and really tried to make my own. I didn’t really understand the actual symmetry and math behind them. Somehow way back then I missed the ease of the patterns, the whole thing seemed to magical and mystical to me. I let the fear of trying to get what was in my head and out onto the paper keep me from realizing that mandalas are just repeating shapes, all made up of other little shapes. Duh. Too much thinking, my own brain got in my way…

She’d been hungry before. It wasn’t even unusual at this time of year, but this had been the hardest and longest winter in her memory. The dried cod was all gone and there was still too much ice out in the fjord for the ships to go out to fish for more. The schools no longer teemed just offshore, as they had in her grandfather’s day.

I believe this serves to show the growing interaction between social media and our personal lives. The line between what we keep private and what we display to the world is disappearing, and it’s doing so at the expense of what has come to amount to our professional credibility.

So the Marriott Copley Place was great to stay for its central location. Boston is a great walking town, so nothing is too far out of reach if you are willing to walk a little. However, the nightly rate is not for the budget crowd. For work, it was great, but I probably would never come here on personal travels unless there was a really good deal.

With any Conservative government, Privatisation is inevitable. Thatcher started off the trend, selling off the ‘family silver’ as it was put by one minister at the time, which included business such as BT and British Gas. Major followed suit with the privatisation of British rail. But now, with sectors of the police to be privatised, along with more NHS privatisation, are the Coalition government going too far?

Armitage is so good in this role. It’s the first thing that leaps out at you. We like Margaret (Daniela Denby-Ashe) right away — who wouldn’t, with those slightly sleepy eyes and arched eyebrows? — but she remains a far more private, unknowable character. Even if you layer on everything you know about nice middle-class girls in the mid-19th century, it’s hard to know what she expects for her future. When I finally got around to reading the Gaskell novel, I wasn’t surprised to find Thornton the protagonist and Margaret the sphinxlike, closed-off character whom he adores. Thornton’s waters run deep and he does, indeed, “have a temper,” but somehow we come to trust the guy.

I had noticed for some time that Charl's toddler bed just wasn't cutting it anymore. He is just simply growing too big. (I'd like to take a moment to pause, while this statement yanks at my heartstrings!) However, we are a family on a pretty tight budget. So finding a brand new bed and mattress at the right price was not going to be easy. Plus, I'm picky. Like, really picky. This is a bed I would like to last several years, so I wanted something to grow with him, not too baby-ish, and that the bedding/ decor could easily be changed with. Not asking much, right? ;) So we shopped around, and nothing we found was really what I wanted, nor the price I wanted to pay. Suck.

Well, people actually hide "treasures" in different places throughout the World and even throughout our "small town" Owasso!! Then, with some type of hand held devise of your choice, you will log onto the geocaching site and find the "caches" nearest your current location. You will be given the coordinates and other info or hints to help you find these treasures!!
Historically, evangelicals have elected to ease the tension between being and becoming in favor of becoming. Some evangelicals have accepted this resolution, declaring war on Barth’s theology, and other evangelicals also have accepted this resolution, seeking peace between orthodoxy and modernity. Are these legitimate dichotomies; must we choose between orthodoxy and capitulation to modernity?

We're busy people. We don't have time for big moments around here. But, I have learned that there is so much joy to be found in those little itty bitty moments. Hugs are wonderful. Little "I love you" moments. Cuddles, snuggles, the list goes on. I used to think that big monumental things were what made life special.. they're not. It's those little tender moments that make my world go 'round.

Mercy often runs into a certain Texan Ranger named Horatio Korman. His entrances gives light to the happenings of the still independent Texas. Korman is everything a seasoned Ranger should be. Straight, strong, and wily and I immediately took a strong liking for him. The mad scientist was a bit of a disappointment. He just never seemed to be effectual or very dangerous. It could be he was outdone by the war machines and a surprise later in the story though.

You can read about the ecological benefits of hemp here. Hemp can play a role in an anti-inflammatory diet, since it is rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Hemp is a good source of fiber and protein, and it is a very sustainable, versatile crop that can grow in North America without pesticides! It is grown in many countries, including Canada, and is considered a good crop to replace tobacco.
Long-standing senior administrators often receive their full salary during transitional leaves, which are meant to give them time to do research or special studies before moving back to a faculty position. In a 2010 News Tribune story, a U of M spokesman said the financial package for Martin’s leave — her $233,250 salary but on an 80 percent appointment — was appropriate because of her 15 years of service as chancellor and her successful fundraising efforts.
After choosing the two sketches I thought worked the best my next job was to start making them into more clearer designs. To do this I decided to first look for a colour scheme that would fit my designs, a great website for this is: http://www.colourlovers.com/.

What happened to change my mind so starkly in the last twenty-four hours?
In the spirit of the ‘Drinking Game’… it must be time for another Cicero quote…
Such privatisations are also profoundly undemocratic. The state might bully you or its agents be rude, but at least as a citizen you can claim legitimate rights in dealing with it. It stands for a democratic bargain. There is no democratic bargain with the privatised employment agencies or schools. As a citizen you have no legitimate or democratic claims on them. You are a social inferior who wants favours and you are expected to behave appropriately. They are there to reinforce social hierarchies and are more important to those who run them than to those they are supposed to serve. The rhetoric of social engagement, community spirit, all-in participation, is designed to conceal the reality of privatised welfare both from those who practise it and those who are subject to it. That is another reason why an increasingly democratic state once, but no longer, turned its face against private charity.”
Let’s call these guys “Ugly hot”… They are not good looking, but there is something sooooo hot about them! They radiate swag. Ever seen a smoking hot bitch walking down the street with an average looking dude?? Or a tall, tanned, chiselled guy with a minga? You wonder “how did that happen”?? It happened because of swag and confidence! If a guy has so much swag and is sure of himself, I will forget who I’m looking at, and actually focus on having fun with him. Of course, I have to have a general level of physical attraction – so it helps if the guy looks after himself by dressing nicely, going to the gym, having a good haircut, etc.

So the critic is now useless and is, as he sees it, a two-generation job. America is full of careers that only lasted two generations. This is a bit fatalistic. And I’m sure he is happy to be the last of a dying breed. "Sorry kids, no more, I’m the last one. HA!"
I love that he is the type of person who will jump in his truck and help look for a missing neighbor kid even if the kid's mom is crazy (that's a long story), or run out to help a friend stuck in a ditch in the middle of the night, or give a homeless guy money or food.
During World War II, both of Jack’s sons enlisted in the armed services. Edward, the oldest, was killed in 1943 in the Pacific War.

I, too have learned something new. It is that, every single time I have seen a copperhead, it's been a banded water snake. The path to my knowledge began yesterday at Green Mountain, where we met some friends to stroll around the lake-which did not happen. We ended up hanging out in the picnic and waterfall area, chatting and enjoying watching the younger kids play while the older kids wandered around and chatted to each other. I remember Jake saying, "I don't want to grow up, all grown ups do is go somewhere and TALK." I think my baby is growing up, as he and Austin ended up confirming each others phone numbers 2 hours later so they could talk more later. haha!

The sale went very well, but it was unpredictable. Some items went for a lot of money, others didn't attract a bid. The *star lot* was estimated at £8,000-£10,000 and went for £11,000 hammer price, £12,650 out of the saleroom, so that was very good. A couple of things that didn't meet their reserve have been sold afterwards for slightly less and some more will probably go in the next few days.

I later returned to the room and sat down to read. I heard music playing very faintly in the corner where the stereo player sat on a table. When I approached the record player, I noticed that a very pointy leaf-tip from a plant sitting on the same table was resting on the spinning record. It was releasing the sound of the music from the vinyl. It seemed that the sound was coming through the plant itself, for the leaf needle had no connection to the speakers.

I labeled it Gluten Free Desserts!, but it's more than that. Each tab features 25 different recipes that are linked to my blog. Each time I upload a new recipe it becomes added to the app menu. What I love about it, since I use it all the time now, is that it makes shopping for ingredients super easy. Instead of writing everything down before I go shopping, I just cruise recipes on my iPhone until I find something I want, and then buy what's in the ingredient list.

The mechanics of the bike, as well as the style, are taken from the traditional artisan process: there are no gears, the wheel has 18 radii and the rear and head lights are pedal activated. The handlebars are in a classic shape with the break mechanics hidden inside the body of the bike for a clean aesthetic. The bike is highly finished, with 24k gold gilding, protected by a all weather varnish, leather seat and black bell with Dolce&Gabbana logo plaque and a handy plastic coated aluminium basket on the front.

I hope also that I didn't give anyone the cold on Thursday evening, as I wasn't going to let it stop me going to a significant event at Blackwell's Manchester University Bookshop: Salt publisher Chris Emery launching his striking new poetry collection, The Departure, and reading with Ian Duhig and Michael Symmons Roberts. Superb readings compered by Fat Roland in inimitable style, and a great meet-up with some familiar figures - writers Adrian Slatcher, David Gaffney, Sarah-Jane Conlon, Edmund Prestwich, Eleanor Rees, Steve Waling and Ian Pople - and introductions to poet Lindsey Holland and novelist Tim Shearer. A convivial drink in the Salutation afterwards, when I learnt from Adrian of his exciting new venture, a new literary magazine for innovative fiction - called 'New Magazine' - for which he is seeking material. And then, before anyone else, I left and stumbled back home to bed.
During this time was the first time in our short foster history where we had to make one of the hardest decision. We had come to realise that dealing with 3 new children, each with their own background issues and behaviours, as well as managing our own family was probably too much for us as first time carers. So we had to make the decision that three was more than we were able to manage and be able to show the right level of emotional support. After many family discussions and discussions with the department we decided that the best solution was either for us to maintain care for Ben and Emma, as we felt seperating the was not an option, or caring soley for Cate. The department agreed that Cate was probably more suited to an environment of a “single” foster child so that she could get the full attention from her carers rather than competing for attention.
Also, I'm thinking of big changes around this here blog. I'm looking for a new design, and probably a new name. Possibly a new server, who knows. Suggestions are welcome. Because I have no idea.
An Incredible Weekend with Ron Meyers, Judith Duff and All Things about Clay

As the system goes, the only difference is that we now play next week instead of having the weeks rest and forego a home preliminary final. A hand full of cold beers took the edge off the disappointment and life goes on. The Melbourne Storm are still more than capable of whipping any of the remaining finalists and in the AFL my Hawks are still a red hot chance of winning their prelim this week and advancing to the Grand Final on the last Saturday in September.
All in all, it is exactly what you would expect from an American Pie movie but with a few grown-up problems thrown in. They haven’t toned down on any aspect like nudity or gross-out bits and the sentimental parts are few and far between. It is great to see all the cast back together to celebrate what they once had at high school. It definitely made me feel nostalgic and now I want to see the original three again!
Booties: Target
But a fake agent or publisher will be more than happy to accept your manuscript as-is, and will do so quickly. They’re unlikely to ask for edits or changes. They will make it very easy for you to be maneuvered into a situation where you end up paying them.
I want to pledge my support to you, and to Longmont, in terms you can understand.
Were we all meant to come out of this as Zen masters? No. But guess what? The idea was to clue us into "awareness", our consciousness, our own purpose...destiny. Some of us did indeed "get it" and some may need a longer to, but that's okay and that doesn't mean the journey stops for any of us.

The real question that dogged me all last weekend, the question whose answer could totally change minds, open eyes, and set spirits soaring is this:
Today I skipped the gym. I am exhausted and Ethan was up alot last night. PLUS this week alone I have started:
Tae Moo goes back to Korea and is welcomed by his girlfriend at the airport – SE NA (Hwa Yong’s counterpart –also played by Jung Yu Mi). Oh my! Love made in hell!
In May 2006, Clifford Wayne Senter, 57, a construction-business owner was killed when he fell nearly 1,000 feet allegedly after climbing out of a helicopter on a mountaintop while hunting in New Zealand.
Even in New York, he watched the bags and took photos while I skated in Central Park.
The people at the restaurant have no English and try as I might I couldn’t understand a word they said. I strained to hear them and for the first time in my life someone spoke to me slower and louder in a foreign language in the hopes I would understand. (I’ve never felt so ignorant!) The only things I understood were the phrases ‘Do you understand?’ (Forstår du?) and ‘it’s a problem, not speaking Danish’ (det er et problem ikke at tale dansk) after I said I do not understand for the millionth time (Jeg forstår ikke). What made it worse is he had a thick middle eastern accent and I had the feeling that Danish wasn’t his first language either, so Danish was our lingua franca.
The Kestenbaums. What can be said about this family that this article doesn't already express in spades. Beauty is just wasted on some folks.
Now is not the time to fight to be mom’s number one kid. It’s not personal. If mom trusts the brother you think is incapable of making all her financial decisions, you must let it go. This is not the time to prove to your mother that you’re really better with finances. There are reasons you mother trusts your brother, and that is just how it is. Unless he’s crooked, he’s your mom’s choice.
who weren’t your mother.
And he thinks he’ll be okay
- Take the phone number and name of a manager at the agency with you. (Paris Address told us that Apt. #1 was inventory from another agency and said that they had not inspected the place personally "yet". Whatever; they moved us.)

According to Bapat, it is known that there is a statistical association between large earthquakes and TEC anomalies as changes in the electron concentration occur a few days before earthquake. “It was found during the recent Tohoku (Fukushima) Japan earthquake that the TEC had increased very high,” Bapat said. It was about three to four times the normal electron concentration.
Around 11 am I went to see other friends to have brunch with them on their porch. One of the great Israeli traditions on Yom ha-Atzmaut is to go out into the country and have a barbecue (or a mangal), but we didn't do that - we had bagels & lox.
It's easy to get discouraged when dealing with government regulations. Trying to focus on the good we'll be able to do will keep me on target.
Nasri’s contract is due to expire at the end of next season but AW the Alchemist says that a deal will be reached in the summer. The idea of signing a new contract isn’t rocket science. In Football Manager ™ , all you have to do is to click on the “offer new contract” icon and everything becomes done and dusted. Besides, it’s the players agent that does the bulk of the work.
At 19 i was in college, studying in a "Male's" field and feeling strong and on top of the world. I did not give birth and have a house to keep up. At 23 i was still in college, ready to graduate and work construction. I was under the impression, at the time, that i would never meet a man that would full fill my dreams, it was simply impossible. A husband for this girl, was out of site and hopeless. I graduated and got a job offer. I bought steel toed boots. I drove down to Bennington and there he was..... History.
Whenever my poor husband, whom I mostly abandon these days, gets sick, he asks for this tea.

I like what Chitanda said about being a top student: she’s only good at the parts and not the whole, the thing that actually matters. This reminds me of some of the classes where I had the feeling that all the class was about was to memorize a bunch of random facts. I guess most of high school is like that though. Anyways, we get some foreshadowing about Chitanda who wants Houtarou for something.

Or so she thinks.
I look down to watch as my childhood shorts stretch into black jeans, I feel the drag as my Police T-Shirt morphs into a black T-shirt. My small body’s limbs contort into a six foot two man running with his dog down a country and overgrown coastal trail...
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today and creates a vision for tomorrow. ~Melody Beattie
So… I’ve been getting text messages here and there. It’s obvious to me that the reality of the situation is eating at my father. I’ve been getting threatening text messages over the last week.
“Between the Fangs of Nightmares/Beyn Anyaab Al-Kawabes” is the culmination of the previous tracks and climax of this project. The combination of dejection and foreboding from the first two songs elope giving birth to this beautiful monstrosity. There is a clear influence of ambient black metal that creeps through the ominous tone of this baby with two guest musicians aiding the effect, Mudamer playing rhythm guitar this time and Demon ov Darkness from BlackSpell playing the first keyboard arrangement. The songs that follow, “Ijtima' Al-Shu'ra'/Gathering of Poets” and “Al-Ahlaam/The Dreams,” draw from the EP's initial classical melancholy marking our journey through Learza's dream world as complete.
“I’m very proud of my manhood. It’s the best part of my body, so I want to look after it. That’s why it’s important to raise awareness of testicular cancer; we need to be more open about our health, go for check-ups and take care of our bodies. I was actually quite shy on my photoshoot. I take off my shirt in front of thousands of people on stage, but when there are just a few people around, it’s nerve-racking. I said, ‘Just make sure the room is warm and I’ll be good’”.
Among the biggest uncertainties sparked by the toppling of Mubarak a year ago was the future of the peace treaty. After four wars involving the two neighbors – in 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973 – the treaty negotiated at Camp David led to Israel handing back to Egypt the Sinai Peninsula, an area three times bigger than Israel itself, which it had captured in the 1967 Six Day War.

Well due to the camping, day 8 actually took a few days. i plan on extending it a bit, simply by going down the list sending beau thankful texts on his lunch break (he cant take phones to work and loves to get texts :) . I should have brought the bad list camping, it would have been easy to burn. But in general i frown on burning things in the house so i just threw it out lol. gone is gone right.
-- 2,518 online interviews averaging 25 minutes among age 18+ adults nationwide screened for using, in the past seven days, at least one of four platforms for their local daily newspaper (either print, online, tablet, and/or smartphone) --1,896 print readers, 1,480 online readers, 864 smartphone readers, 734 tablet readers.

Fareda: (mutters under her breath) Wow, what a purpose.
I could feel the people beside and behind me cringing away when I responded, "I don't think so, Father."
Banana Man: Yeah, you see there's a whole um, ah, basket of us fruit. Those guys doing underwear commercials are actually rejects.
The extremist claims were based on four YouTube video recordings of speeches that are now removed from the website.
I must admit I'm terribly confused, or discombobulated as my grandmother would have said. It's this crazy weather! I know some of you are having winter, like Denver who had like a million inches of snow this week, but down here it's full blown spring. Everything's blooming! Like these beautiful flowers I saw on my walk yesterday:

To be this strong and yet this nuanced - by heck that's an achievement.
The stripes came out really crisp! There was a small bit of seepage though where the cork met the metal frame but it was due to my application and not the tape - the metal frame wasn't flush with the cork and I don't think I had the tape pushed down tight enough into the gap. You shouldn't have this problem though when using the tape on a flat wall surface. I'll definitely use these ScotchBlue Edge-Lock tapes again.

Happy new year everyone. I hope you achieve everything you wish for this year. After a long hard consideration I've decided not to continue with my blog on a regular basis. When I started out the blog was influenced by my card making. Somehow I let this totally turn around so my craft was ruled by my blog and what my followers would like to see.I felt (and quite rightly too) the need to give links to the free artwork I have used in my creations, which sometimes took me a long while to trace the origins if I hadn't already saved the page addresses.My blog also sometimes got in the way of doing stuff that wasn't really blogworthy ie, repeat stuff or items using images I didn't have links for.
“Are they as good as your daddy’s pancakes?” A sly smile came across Tara’s face as she watched Emily eat. She wanted to know more about the children’s father since Ashlynn hadn’t told them anything. Knowing little kids were easy to get things out of,Tara thought she’d probe them a little to see what she could find out.
"American Way," I marked on the sticky, and requested the book. I pitched it to my editor who said yes. I then proceeded to read all 660+ pages of the book.
2 1/2 cups peeled yellow peaches (I am not sure i got yellow and i sure as heck don't have time to peel them.... i did throw them on the grill for a few minutes as it warmed up for a little grilled flava.)

Apoaequorin has been proven to be an effective neuroprotector; which simply means it has the ability to keep brain cells (or nerve cells) from dying.
So momentous is this, Wikio has even started calling it the 'beer and wine' listing rather than 'wine and beer'.
Name Your Link">Moneyball may be a niche movie that could easily be lost on people who don’t like sports or baseball or the statistics that go along with baseball but its a great movie non the less. Pitt and Jonah Hill are a great unlikely team and they make you root for them and the team the whole time.
Yesterday my sister, Heather, told a story on her Facebook page about my four year old niece, Sammy. Sammy recently made $1.00 selling something at a garage sale and was super excited about earning her first dollar! She begged my sister to take her to the store so she could pick out some candy to buy with her own money.
I would venture to say that this is a brew that would be best served as a “dinner” beer. It would enhance a hearty soup, then great a well flavored savory entrée with open arms and not be intimidated by either a sweet or fruit for the last dance.
Users of the internet demonstrate how widely the debate is cast, and how lively the medium is for brainstorming, discussion and famous last words – in which Dunedin comes to resemble hapless prey, underscored by truths, comparisons and denials of sorts.
And, it occurred to us to wonder about, among other things, how does one come to ask such a “favor” of God? Is it desperation? Or, is it something else?
Reporter: Why the switch in the first place?
Those are our natural reactions. It’s in our sinful nature to hold grudges and hang on to anger. But I’ll tell you this, there is no room for malice or grudges where the Holy Spirit is present. Period. The two cannot coexist. In fact they do not coexist.
You want to be treated like a man, you better not cry.

The largest part of the barn has already fallen and been taken away. No one wants to take on the job of dismantling, as it is too dangerous. Nature will have her way. She already has, notice the texture of this wood and stone...
The First Look at the Mummy
Our lovely Victorian terrace was in much need of love and care when we purchased it.
First things first, I had to find an eating plan that worked for me. I’ve been a vegetarian for the past 9 years with no interest in changing that so my options were limited right at the start. And then I found Kimberly Snyder and I knew right away that this was the one for me. I devoured her blog (http://www.kimberlysnyder.net/blog/) and shortly after purchased her book, The Beauty Detox Solution. It has radically changed my life and a lot of my previously held beliefs about my body. Everything she had to say made sense, so much sense that I could hardly believe I’d never put it all together on my own.
And he really was, y'all. A couple of times during the show, I broke my gaze with Prince Sara'sFutureBoyfriend to see what Andy was doing, and he was always looking at me with this concerned face, like he was worried we would have to stop at a mental institution (or a strip club) on the way home.
Often we have rubbed up those who should support us the wrong way through programmes criticising them. This has happened frequently with the local council. They frequently don’t or won’t understand the nature of ‘access’.
