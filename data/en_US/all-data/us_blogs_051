Belt fabric: I used fake leather, but you can use whatever you want! Make sure your fabric does not have any stretch and is sturdy enough to handle belt-stress (or else plan on interfacing that sucker!). I have 1/4 yard here, but I think you could feasibly get by on much less… 1/4 yard was just the minimum cut at my particular store.
This recipe makes a very rich and slightly bitter hot chocolate. Consume with moderation as it tends to cause excessive Christmas cheer. Enjoy!

Americans don't like soccer because nothing happens in soccer. "Well what about baseball?" you are probably whining right now, as your ilk often does. Baseball, while admittedly a more deliberate affair than basketball or football, is far and away more interesting than soccer. Baseball features fairly regular scoring, and a game that can change complexion with a single swing of the bat.
Found this video of Cyrus at the OCW Jummah Prayers Show (on the 21st) Cyrus starts the video and speaks til about 2:25 (he returns at 9:54) It is a very 'pretty ' video of "Jummah Day". Produced with pretty, pretty music. Lulling us into a peaceful state as we listen to the gentle, peaceful words. Just listen... listen...listen to the music.....

Okay, maybe the real reason I’m nervous is because I keep thinking about my friend Marie, who was pregnant a few months ago. She went in to the clinic for her first pre-natal visit and they did some sort of blood tests on her and told her that her baby would be deformed and that she’d better terminate the pregnancy soon. I still don’t know exactly what sort of tests they’re doing now, but I’ve read that they’re super accurate and we’ve really come a long way in being able to diagnose abnormalities before the pregnancy starts making a real baby.

If you’ve read two or three of his books from the list these stories were taken from, then I think you’ll still enjoy it. I previously read five of the twelve books so the feeling of déjà vu popped up somewhat frequently for me which I found a tad disappointing.
“Frank’s not here yet, but if he was, that blueberry pie would be gone.” Because “was” is used, even if it read, “If Frank was here, that pie would be gone,” readers can assume that Frank will show up eventually, and the pie is in danger.

This bee preserved in amber is identical to present-day honeybees. These, with the same mechanisms they have possessed for millions of years, continue living in the same social structure. No “survival of the fittest” of the kind claimed by evolutionists is ever to be seen in beehives. On the contrary, bees behave with the highest levels of altruism and co-operation, in a beehive hierarchy consisting of the queen, workers and males (or drones).
Only to wake up to Noodle in the next room screaming, “MAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!” in the middle of the night.
The room was silent as he finished talking and after a pause he turned his attention to the young woman at his feet. It had been his intention to have her in the quarters that had been prepared for him, but after facing such resistance he felt the need for an audience. He grasped her by her throat and as he pulled her upright she struggled against him, yelping and moaning. He could barely contain himself. He dragged Jezebel to the nearest table (which was quickly vacated) and threw her open it, spilling its contents to the ground. In the corner her associates merely watched. They hadn’t moved at all. No matter. Lord Fuckington grabbed at her tits, squeezing them hard, and then ripped open her blouse, snapping the drawstring.
It was a whirlwind weekend and a great experience. I produced content for the Conference Daily printed newspaper (We handed our content to the printer at 7 p.m. and had fresh copies, hot of the press by 5 a.m. each morning) and for the conference blog. Below are a few of the stories I produced.

I’ve gone on and on about acting but I’m going to go on a bit more. A month ago, we organized an acting workshop in the theatre group that I’m in. It was supposed to be about comedy but we concentrated more on bodylanguage, expression and how you can express something in a very small and delicate way or make it big and noticeable.
Evalle is partnered with the new guy, Storm, taking shifts with others of her clan (the Beladors) to search for the Ngak stone. The god Shiva has prophesied that it would find a powerful female and the apocalypse would begin. They have a week to find it, during which time, Evalle must solve a murder that would otherwise be pinned on her, and show the gods that she isn’t a dangerous creature that needs to be locked up, but a powerful ally that needs to remain where she is.

“2 Broke Chicks” (CBS) This show really bummed me out, man. I was so looking forward to it and really expecting a lot from the crackling-good cast, but, the writing was just not there to back them up. And on top of all that, the jokes were really gross. And not even clever gross, just gross and crass for crass-ness sake. Urgh…soooo disappointing!
She adjusted her top again, strode up to the door, and tugged it open, only to walk head on into a tall drink of bouncer. She tipped her head back and gasped. Wow, evil sure looked good these days. No wonder they did so well in there.
"Chief among the creatures who gather around Diana is vampire Matthew Clairmont, a geneticist with a passion for Darwin. Together, Diana and Matthew embark on a journey to understand the manuscript’s secrets. But the relationship that develops between the ages-old vampire and the spellbound witch threatens to unravel the fragile peace that has long existed between creatures and humans—and will certainly transform Diana’s world as well."
And this bonds us. Permanently.
There was more to come the next day in the news paper. I read a story that there had been an unsolved murder at Palaruvi waterfalls the week before. My goodness! The torn shirt piece I noticed at the water fall was probably torn off the victims body in a scuffle. Now a real eerie feeling set in.

I’d sleep for as long as I could and then I’d get up. I always slept for at least 6 or 7 hours but I always got up around 8pm at the latest to go back into work that night. I used to leave the house at about 8:30pm.
The goal is to let your doctor know that you value the good care she gives you. If your doctor goes the extra mile for you, express gratitude. We all like to hear that we have done well or that we have done something to improve someone else’s life. Doctors need that too.
I also have some other totally awesome news....... I've signed up to take another class with???? .......... Suzanne Dean.... Yeahhhhhhhhhh she is coming to one of my 'kind of' local craft stores. It's almost an hour away so when I take a trip there it's usually only once a month. I took a few of her Copic classes last year and what an awesome great time I had. She is so talented sweet and wicked funny.
JS: The hardest part was actually writing the book. That’s a lot of words to weave together in some form of coherency! As the ideas and plotlines swarm around the sieve that controls what flows out of your fingers, it can get difficult to filter which ideas are viable for any given story. The fact of the matter is that I enjoy writing; I enjoy the sense of satisfaction I receive when I finish a chapter or a story. Once the story is completely finished, and the editing starts, there’s almost a relaxation that occurs. You have the story that you wanted to write out of your head and your soul, now it’s just polishing it to the point that it’s the best that it can be. Teaming with my publisher, Sirens Call Publications, helped me to traverse the world of publishing as well. Was it a struggle at times? Absolutely, but in the end it was a labor of love and one that I will happily do over and over again…
And it's "all about the love"---as fits the date (it's still Valentine's Day here in California). Dave Hingsburger hosted the February edition, about loving the stuff that makes life work--accessibility symbols, service dogs, a power chair, big jackets with pockets...and then veers into ruminations on cyborgs, gratitude, and friendship. I love when a host highlights the connections between many diverse posts, and Dave certainly does that.

However, he noted that the B.C. Social Credit legacy keeps being reincarnated, under different banners. "Each transition gives the NDP a chance at power, which they manage to fail at," he notes.
For example if you question the unmitigated benefits of multiculturalism you are decried as a racist, if you suggest that any section of the community, other than the white community, might possibly have undesirable behavioural or social characteristics, you are a racist, in fact if you demonstrate anything short of total surrender to the cult of enrichment that in itself will automatically render one at risk of shrill accusations of bigotry, xenophobia, hatred, and of course racism.
None of this would happen with Dr. G. She would take great pains to pay attention to my every detail. She would inspect my bowel, “inch by inch” and I have no doubt she would keep her latte in the break room.
We, the purveyors of ghosties and other bad things that go bump in the night and scare the bejesus out of us, are starving. Fed a barely palatable diet of uninspired remakes of Japanese horror imports and 80s slasher flicks served up with paltry sides of three-dimensional gimmicks and computer-generated imagery for the past several years, and we’re malnourished. It’s no surprise then that we’re so hungry for quality, so ravenous for something to satiate our horror taste buds that we’d pounce like a slobbering alien on the crew of the Nostromo on the first promising morsel of original horror cinema that crosses the threshold of our local multiplex.

Any one who spent anytime as a youth during the 1980’s no matter what ages, has at some point felt a connection to a John Hughes film. One of the decades most loved film makers, Hughes passed away 2 1/2 years ago and had given up writing original screenplays, although he was the creator behind some movies with story ideas. He hadn’t directed a film since 1991’s Curly Sue. His films throughout the 80’s were loved by all and Hughes himself was regarded as a voice for the youth of all kinds. A voice for the youth wasn’t his only talent as a story teller.
But since Shyla's rescue, things have gotten bizarre. Or as the other paladins are used to saying: things have gone all to Zell. After returning from a mission in the Sierra Nevada broken and almost dead, Zell learns a new type of undead is stalking him.

Sax took his Buppy in with him for surgery, so Buppy got a new 'collar' for surgery (since the wrist band wouldn't fit his arm.) When the nurse took the IV out of Sax's hand, though, he didn't put pressure on the hole right away and blood gushed across Buppy's back. I got most of it cleaned up. Buppy is going to need a bath. But here is a picture of him and Buppy snuggling on the couch once we got home....

Yay! The new sketch is up at the Freshly Made Sketches Blog, and I couldn't wait to play along. While I haven't yet posted them, I have been able to keep up with my goal of five Christmas cards a month for the 2012 Christmas Card Challenge at Splitcoast. But that is all I have done - my 5 a month, and that is NOT going to get me to the number of cards I will need for the holidays.
I grew up reading Thor comics, I have more than a passing knowledge of Norse mythology, and armed with these two things I still struggled through Thor, not only the worst movie I’ve seen in years, but easily the worst superhero movie ever made. Worse than Fantastic Four. Worse than Daredevil. Worse than Ghost Rider. Worse, in a way, than the Dolph Lundgren Punisher.
01. SO I CAN SPREAD THE WORD, duh! I’ve wanted to speak about recovery/eating disorders (or write or something..) for a long time. But I was so actively in my disorder (/or in denial) that I couldn’t do it. I mean, who would take me seriously first of all. And second of all, I really couldn’t live with myself if I was touting the awesomeness of recovery but going home and throwing away my dinner or something. But this has been a huge motivator for me. I love being able to share with others that this is POSSIBLE and sosososo much better than being sick. Even though it’s hard and messy and uncomfortable.
The recipes varied widely, some requiring lengthy baking times, others as simple as a skillet, pecans and honey. I thought I’d start out with a simple version – just honey and pecans in a skillet – but when I poured them onto a cookie sheet to cool, they stayed very sticky, as if they were coated in caramel.
Well, I think she missed the point of the piece, in which I argued that people “whom doctors used to call ‘mentally retarded’” and members of Mensa – incorrectly described routinely as “geniuses” – are both freaks by mathematical definition because they each make up less than 2% of the population.

The tower built therein is the word concerning God himself, and concerning Christ’s dispensations. This vineyard He committed to husbandmen, that is, to the people that was before us, both priests and laity, and went into a far country, by His departure giving opportunity to the husbandmen.

My teaching philosophy hinges on a set of values that have progressively clarified over the course of the past five years. As an educator, what I value most are: 1. The importance of critical-historical thinking; 2. The importance of collateral learning; 3. The importance of openness in educational resources; 4. The importance of empathy to understanding the past; and, 5. The importance of a Do-It-Yourself attitude for the cultivation of life-long learning.

. . . he is discovering all the not-so-fun things about being a toddler boy. hitting, pinching, biting, slapping. poor sydney is usually the victim of these attacks. her long hair is constantly getting yanked. she sweetly gives him a hug and he tries to bite her shoulders. mommy frequently gets slapped or clawed in the face. this is all new for us. i've broken back out the "what to expects" and "happiest child on the block" to figure out how to solve these issues. i know it's no big deal. i know it's normal. i know it's just a phase. but still, being backhanded by your toddler really hurts . . . especially a toddler who doesn't really "get" the concept of time-out yet.
Teens may not listen to authority figures, but they do listen to each other. Firsthand stories of the constant fear, danger and violence of life inside a gang are a way to reach young people on the cusp of making the life-destroying decision to join a gang. Quotes from the interviewed gang members will be included in ARISE Foundation’s new upcoming collection of stories about gangs, written by people from all over the country. Each story was handpicked to illustrate a critical point. Topics range from the disastrous effects gang life has on someone’s family members to how easy it is to lose your life to gang violence. The stories illustrate, using plaintive, stark language, how easy it is to get caught up in the endless cycle of revenge that gang members live in every day.

Note: If you want to read the Iliad, I recommend the translation of Richmond Lattimore. It’s available both as a printed book and as an eBook. I am including the publisher’s link which provides purchasing options here. Lattimore is also available free online through Northwestern University’s Homer Project. This is great but you’ll have to cope with the English being interspersed with the original ancient Greek – it’s great if you’re a Classics student!

Some people think married couples wear wedding rings to show our status, like a cab driver with a rooftop sign alit: “Unavailable.” For me, it’s a reminder and a connection. I look down at that ring and feel not just the love for my husband, but all of our history – beautiful and challenging alike – as well as the place where we fell in love and said our vows. I love that place.
Unfortunately, the analysis does not end there. I’ve been to university. I’ve studied English literature and teaching at three of Europe’s most prestigious institutions. I’ve never even held a real gun, let alone used it to pistol-whip anyone. And do I try hard? Yes, I do try hard. There’s no doubt about it: I’m a David, caught in a web of sterile self-reflection. I wouldn’t know an engaging story if it came along and shat in my mental toilet.
Most agree that Clausen’s early commitment was precipitated by the imprisonment and subsequent transportation to Tatooine of Carroll. Though reports are hazy at the moment, insiders have speculated that Carroll was lured into a trap by Sith lord and ICAA President Darth Brand in an alliance of convenience with Notre Dame and the Hutt syndicate. The resulting battle has accounted for at least four dozen Rebel Alliance casualties and an unknown number of USC football team manager deaths.

I pick up pennies. My grandfather, a man who holds a large part of my heart so tenderly, once told me his grandmother, the woman who raised him during The Great Depression, always walked with her head down searching for stray coins. I found this so touching; I never walk by any coin without picking it up but see people do that quite often. The first time I visited her grave, I placed a penny upon it and said, “Thank you for raising my Granddad” and wept for a while never to know the woman who meant so much to him. Piper’s middle name is my great, great grandmother’s maiden name. Maybe I should invent yoga pose, “Penny Picker.” Regardless, you see the irony, not pick up a penny or coin but complain when a few are added to the cost of a stamp, often a work of art in itself.
Spending the time to repair the walls was well worth it, however, because as soon as the first coat of paint went up, I could see the improvement.
Dedicated to the most elegant recreation,
Here’s the bad part about affairs – in the end, there is a very high risk that you won’t end up with the woman/man and someone ends up getting hurt, and in my situation, someone did get hurt, and that person was me. My friend from the forum asked me, “If he ever realized how much you were hurt and wanted to try to make it up to you, is there anything he could do to make it up – you know, make up for the pain?” That was a deep question. I am over that situation, but emotional pain is not something easily erased. It’s not as simple as saying you’re sorry- some cases of “making it up” require action(s) and not words, and this is exactly what my old friend meant. I don’t have an answer for her – I told her that I’ll have to think about that and email her in one day or so. If I come up with an answer, I’ll let you all know, too. And, who knows, maybe he also was hurt in the end – I hope not, I made sure to give him lots of love and an exorbitant amount of good sex whenever we could have it! Lol. If I did hurt him, he doesn’t seem to be the kind of man that you could make that up to, even if you wanted to. With that said, I will not say, “I’ll never be involved in an affair again” because I might shoot myself in the foot; after my experience, I know better to never say “never”. I won’t go out of my way to be in one, but if I DO find myself in such a situation, I WILL NOT be getting hurt because I won’t be taking him seriously, I will definitely date other men, and….you can do like Annie and “bet your bottom dollar” that Sam will be compartmentalizing like a m*tha-f*cka!
What are you doing right now while trying to write this post??? Watching NCIS reruns.
I can't recall where this one was recorded. There are only two songs on the actual studio part of the demo, but one is 6 mins, and the other is a fucking 8 minute long epic. I have no idea what we were thinking in writing songs that long, but here they are. The other three songs on the tape are live at the Shaker high school battle of the bands. The sound quality is pretty good. I think we won.. I forget, I got kicked out of the school before we were done playing.

Whilst I was waiting for ECG and bloods the receptionist came to find me to check whether I am attending both of the hospital appointments I'm scheduled for on thursday afternoon. After confirming that yes I am, yes they are both at different hospitals and yes I had tried to change the date we got to the point which was how to transport my notes between the two sites when the appointments are only 2 hours apart. I suggested that perhaps I could take the notes with me when being driven from the first to second appointment but that is not allowed as I am a patient. I might after all eat my notes for something to do in the car. Or read them. The possibilities of what I could do with a pile of notes entirely about myself, weighing almost as much as myself are frankly endless. So instead a nice man with a van will have to drive from one hospital to the other to collect the notes and we'll all hope they turn up at either or both consultants appointments...cos to be fair to the doctors, running a consultation without any notes is a bit tricky. Not to mention potentially wasteful of money or any such practical considerations.

I wasn’t really expecting to learn as much an insight and moral from an action-packed movie – especially a superhero movie – such as The Avengers. Maybe I wasn’t into critiquing the plot of a movie or maybe I was boxed with the idea that movies do not necessarily reflect reality. But I sure did pick up lessons after I’ve seen the film.

I can finally, just now, start to think about Mila's future a bit more. Seriously during that time we had to literally take life one moment at a time and simply could not see past the stepping stone we were currently walking on. Looking back I picture Shawn and I standing in the middle of an empty land with stepping stones only behind us, trying to see ahead but not being able to because of the heavy fog. Moment by moment, the Lord reached out and took our hands leading us to the next stone. The night I was alone in CICU with Mila I was soooo tired and stressed after a long rough day. She woke up for the 78th time and I just stood by her bed praying for God to lay His hand on her and comfort her because I was too weary to keep at it by myself. At that moment I so vividly felt God's hand on my shoulder comforting me. I prayed for Him to comfort her not me. But there He was beside me when I felt I couldn't carry on another minute alone. I surely felt His presence at that time more than any other time I can remember. Peace washed over me and I could feel so many prayers being said for Mila and for us. I treasure that memory because it comes to mind each time I am weary and feel like I can't make it to the next moment and it reminds me He is our strength and with Him we can get through anything even when the moment seems absolutely impossible. Mila-bean is teaching me so much already and helping me find a strength I never knew I could tap into.

Antichrist follows the story of She (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and He (Willem Dafoe) a couple who, after the death of their toddler son, go to their cabin in the woods Eden (natch) where the man experiences increasingly bizarre visions and she exhibits increasingly violent sexual behavior. He finds She's work that she did for her PhD which is about witchcraft and the writing gets more obsessive and insane. She maims He brutally by smashing his testicles and drilling a hole through his leg and bolting a stone through it.

There, in the middle of the store, she was putting her flip-flops back on under the judging eye of a mother, who for good reason, did not want her daughter walking barefoot through a department store! Can you blame her? And what of the daughter who slips shoes off so easily with no thought of the pathogens lining the floor? The daughter reminded me of me. You couldn’t keep shoes on me when I was a kid. My feet were tough as little hooves from walking to friends houses barefoot; from running in warm summer rain. Barefoot was the sensuous and free delight of childhood.

Up in the Air is brutally raw. It is embedded with irony and colorful imagery that leads the reader to get lost in the story as it becomes more twisted, more apparent that something is not right. As we turn the pages we are left in wonderment of a life we will never live, yet can completely relate to. It offers a refreshingly real and honest look at the deformities of human nature as Bingham grows more and more paranoid and self-indulged the closer he gets to his goals, leaving us with one question – what really matters in life?

The Shard, also known as the Shard London Bridge, is a glass (recalling a shard of glass) pyramid-shaped skyscraper under construction in Southwark, London. The structure was just recently completed in April 2012, and it is expected to open to the public quite soon. The structure has been designed with an irregular triangular shape from the base to the top and through a sophisticated use of glazing with expressive façades of angled glass panes intended to reflect sunlight and the sky above, so that the appearance of the building will change according to the weather and seasons.

I cannot say it enough how happy I am about how this came together! I started by making the pinwheels. The larger pinwheel is made from a 3'' square and the smaller pinwheels are from 2'' squares. I then used brads to hold them together. The sticks are lollipop sticks, that I use when I'm making candy, that I inked using Tim Holtz- Broken China. I then attached the pinwheels to the sticks at varying heights. The grass is a piece of scrap paper that I had and then fringed to make it look more like grass. The clouds were cut from one of the pre-loaded images on the Cricut Imagine and then inked with Tim Holtz- Broken China. Everything except for the grass is popped up using pop dots. I LOVE those things! I use them on almost EVERYTHING! LOL!
One of the group’s funders was the John M. Olin Foundation, which invested millions of dollars in the law and economic movement – endowing university chairs, funding think-tanks and providing early support for the Federalist Society, which was founded in 1982 by former attorney general Ed Meese, controversial Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork and Ted Olsen—who years later would win the infamous Bush v. Gore case before the Supreme Court in 2000 and then go on to serve as Bush’s solicitor general. The foundation said in a 2003 report to its trustees, “All in all, the Federalist Society has been one of the best investments the foundation ever made.”
Oxford reform bill -- another subject on which Gladstone changed his mind, for he had opposed the original commission of a report on reform. Gladstone was unusually willing to change his opinions, but not necessarily willing to be seen as having changed. Gladstone constructed and carried the legislation through parliament in 1864 almost unaided. Opened up Oxford to Dissenters (Gladstone himself opposed including this in the bill while supporting it in principle). Replaced government by the heads of colleges by an elected board. Permitted the opening of private halls at the university in order to provide opportunities for less wealthy students to matriculate (without transgressing the independence of the existing colleges). The bad feeling at Oxford about his role in reform ultimately led to his election defeat of 1865.

Other than a conversation about masturbation, a lesbian kissing scene, and a brief topless sunbathing scene, the movie is appropriate for teens, while still having enough tension to keep older audiences interested. My only criticism with the film is that I would have added a bit more struggle with nature, because of the name of the film and it being a major theme that is not fully exploited.
In the meantime, though: some catching up from last weekend.

Annie and Snow were also captivating to watch. Snow made the classic villainous mistake of underestimating Annie’s intentions towards Eve’s welfare and it cost him his life. I guess this should now mean that the Old Ones are out of the equation but in this show’s effortless methods of adapting, I can’t wait to see what Mr Rook and his band of domestic staff are going to bring for the next series. It might be nice to have another main Big Bad that isn’t a supernatural threat.

Cath Campbell's practice to date is dominated by an ongoing enquiry into the status, meaning and fabric of architecture and public space. Taking Modernism as a point of departure Campbell has consistently re-appropriated architectural imagery to create works that reinvent our associations with the built environment. And we said nothing, all the day continues this analysis from the privacy of her dining room table. The work is an ongoing unlimited series of photographs that are presented stacked and leant along a narrow shelf. Taking it's title from a line in John Donne's poem The Ecstasy each photograph is of another photograph chosen as if Campbell is a tourist looking around the city portrayed, taking snaps of things that catch her eye. These Lo-Fi images, which often include the reflection or shadow of Campbell and her Camera on the original photograph, serve to undermine the authoritarian status assumed by the original imagery.

But back to the stone, and the possibility of its being some kind of engraving. It has occurred to me that the stone was carved in the way it is the day before I found it, someone messing about with blade and rock, and then tossing it into the waves; it has also occurred to me - and this is much more fascinating, from a storytelling point of view at least - that the stone is in fact ancient, as is the image and whatever it depicts; but that it was carved by a child, or some talentless fool; that it is not ancient, simply primitive or unsophisticated, and thus thrown away for being useless in the context of the culture it sprang from.
I wasn’t a Christian at the time. I didn’t have my Saviour to lean on. I felt like my parenting days were over. I never wanted to go through this pain again. G’s case worker called and said another caseworker had a case and it was a perfect placement for us. I told her no way, I didn’t even ask my husband, I just knew we couldn’t go through this pain again. She argued with me (we had become close while working with several kids together). I will never forget, she said “just try it for 2 weeks, I know these kids are meant to be yours.” Well we said ok, but we really just felt like we were going to be a temporary placement and in 2 weeks they would have had time to find a long term foster home for them.
I really like Shankar Jaikishan's lovely theme for Bombay Talkie. Its so contemporary it feels like it could have been written yesterday and it has such a soothing, lilting groove that it just grows on you with every listen. Kalyanji's Anadji's music for Zanjeer, on the other hand, has a classic seventies feel to it. I love the melody and the arrangement that accompanies the atmospheric video. R.D. Burman's haunting title music for Caravan has been a favorite of mine for years. It features a great wordless vocal by Usha Iyer as Asha Parekh helplessly drives a runaway car down a mountain. Yikes!

As much as I love it, it is such a nice treat when I don’t have to cook sometimes. Now that can mean ordering pizza if I’m lacking energy and the husband and I need a low-key night with a movie from Redbox. But sometimes, it’s nice to have a date night where the husband and I get to go out somewhere nice where we get to sit down, be waited on, drink a glass of wine and use cloth napkins!

I placed the vowel pieces on the floor and then I said a word and Tyler was to put the flashcard under the correct vowel... some were CVC words and others started with the vowel. Easy enough!

Arvo's website lists several staff names and email addresses, and the URL is registered to Arvo General Coordinator Volkan Dogan, who also signed the contract I saw. But Hulya Dayan, who gives her title as "Acquiring Editor," is the only Arvo staff member that anyone has reported dealing with. She's also listed as the translator of many of Arvo's books, despite the shaky command of English exhibited in her emails (several Arvo authors have told me that their translators were hired by the company as independent contractors). So Arvo's staff may be quite a bit smaller than its website encourages viewers to assume.

Over the past couple of months I’ve been exposed to some pretty cool non-traditional educational programs that are going on around the world. Schools like YIP, Hyper Island, Kaospilots, Embercombe, Knowmads (of course), Rietveld and many others that aren’t following strict curriculum, schedules, academics, or pumping out humans to join the rat race. All these schools have their unique selling points and each one would give you a completely different learning experience.

As I waited for my train, I scanned the book and read the first line. Nothing captivating but since I had the novel in my hands, my curiosity began to build and I became impatient to see what the hype was about. I got past the first paragraph and proceeded to the next and the next and the next. An hour later, I realized that I was half-way home, still reading, and unable to put the book down.

The feminist movement introduced an unbelievable amount of tension into the relationships between men and women. Feminism gave us women permission to nag and criticize our husbands, which most women can do just fine without any special permission. The legacy of the feminist movement has been to turn the home, which should be the place of cooperation, into a sphere of competition between men and women. And ironically, feminism, which was supposed to be about getting beyond stereotypes, supported the most negative of stereotypes about men.
On hot summer evenings, I’d step outside to catch a breeze and Marcel would sometimes join me. We’d sit together in my garden, enjoying the stars and the night air.

Is there a Church which has historically existed in every generation since the time of the Apostles and before that in the Prophets?
During the initial years of electricity distribution, Edison's direct current was the standard for the United States, and Edison did not want to lose all his patent royalties. Direct current worked well with incandescent lamps, which were the principal load of the day, and with motors. Direct-current systems could be directly used with storage batteries, providing valuable load-levelling and backup power during interruptions of generator operation. Direct-current generators could be easily paralleled, allowing economical operation by using smaller machines during periods of light load and improving reliability. At the introduction of Edison's system, no practical AC motor was available. Edison had invented a meter to allow customers to be billed for energy proportional to consumption, but this meter worked only with direct current. As of 1882 these were all significant technical advantages of direct current. – Wikipedia

05. Bitch - Room Eleven / 3:58
I’ve told my wife on occasion that even if I were independently wealthy, living off of a mine of oil or something in my back yard, I’d still be working hard, just on different things. I’d push the design of Zomblobs! even more, and develop its sister game that I’ve had rattling around in my mind. I’d make a steampunk fabrication lab behind the house. (Probably not by the oil well, though.) I’d write and illustrate more books. As it is, I’m doing those things when I can, in small ways, but if I didn’t have to work for a living, I’d simply have more time for the things I love to do. I’d still love to work and produce things I consider valuable, it would just have a different tenor to the process. If money could be made with the fruits of my labor, hey, that’s a bonus, but it wouldn’t be the reason for working. I’d be working because I value what I’d be doing and what I’d be producing.
Now we were headed back up the mountain and this time it was steep and highly muddy, it was worse than walking up a big sand dune. Then to top it all off, the top of this hill had 2 sets of 12 foot walls we had to scale. The only real way to get over it was to boost each other. Teamwork was essential and the best part about TM was every single person doing it was all one big team. One of my team members rather remarkably launched himself up on his own… he’s 6 foot 5 inches! I’m pretty sure all of us got hurt on this one… I definitely rolled a nut and had a pin on my race number pop out and stab me. Once up you had to stay there and help somebody else get up, it was the code after all. It was then followed by a 12 foot jump or an attempt to slide down the wall. The Berlin Walls were absolutely brutal.

However, recently I've had a complete change of heart on the idea. It's actually genius when you think about it. If you ran out of bread completely you'd just forfeit the toastie and get something else to eat but with an odd number of slices you find out you've got all the ingredients ready to go and yet only one slice of bread left. That means it's time to go buy a new loaf of bread but to be consistent you have to buy the same type of loaf as before.
I'm not feeling up to a sensible reflection on any of this on account of information overload, but there is a tone that runs through much of this discussion that doesn't sit terribly well with me (Nostrand Park, who led off the discussion on Brooklynian, took issue with the article's characterization of CH, and I agree with them). Whether it's the initial article passing off the West Indian Day parade (one of the largest street festivals and celebrations of Caribbean culture in the world) as a post-riot "Caribbean festival" that makes the neighborhood more desirable for condo-building or the language of colonization/invasion deployed in so much of this discourse, I feel like a) I'm not learning a lot from it and b) it's not offering a very accurate or nuanced portrayal of what's actually happening in the neighborhood. Even the snarky mockery that lots of blogs/comments employ strikes me as unproductive - it's easy to poke fun at the gentrifyers, but that seems to be a project for justifying one's own authenticity/self-awareness in the context of neighborhood change (and to raise a question that was raised of this blog in comments in the post below, I wonder how many of the people commenting on this WSJ article are CH residents, and what demographic they're in).

Lastly, Katie's writing is even better in this addition because she fully fleshed out the characters and plot events to the point where they jumped of the page, and from that she shows she's one author who knows how to write quite the kick-butt chick-lit/romance/mystery read.

This is a really stupid movie but I have always enjoyed it and it still makes me laugh. It is pretty similar to Road Trip, which came out four years prior. I think this movie does just enough to set itself apart and make it memorable, for me anyways. I know a guy from high school who looks exactly like Matt Damon in this movie, and he is the lead singer of a band now. I love that song he sings “Scotty doesn’t know,” it stays with me for days. Otherwise there isn’t much more worth mentioning here, mediocre cast in the leading roles with the support of several big names in cameos. Aside from Damon, Lucy Lawless, Vinnie Jones, Fred Armisen, Diedrich Bader, and the incredibly funny Jeffrey Tambor appear in cameo roles. They all came together for this movie and were very funny. In the lead cast Jacob Pitts was exceptionally funny and I will always remember him from this movie. The others were funny as well but have done little else with their careers. This is a quick and pointless movie so if you know that going in I think it is worth your time. It’s a funny movie that I always enjoy seeing, but nevertheless it doesn’t deserve much more than this as far as a review goes.
However, sizing also plays a factor in the cost analysis -- some diapers, covers, and AIOs only fit a certain weight range per size, which means you could end up having to buy up to 4 separate sizes. Others are "One-Size," which means you can customize the size from birth through potty training (usually by adjusting with snaps).

6. To make the white chocolate whipped cream, melt the white chocolate with 2 tablespoons of the heavy cream in a small, heavy saucepan. Remove from the heat and let cool to body temperature. With an electric mixer, whip the remaining cream to soft peaks. Add the melted white chocolate and mix well. Whip the white chocolate cream until slightly stiffer peaks form. It will not be as stiff as plain whipped cream; do not overbeat, or the cream and the white chocolate may separate. Spread the topping over the cake and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, until set. Sprinkle with the white chocolate shavings. To cut the cake, use a large chef’s knife dipped in hot water and wiped clean between cuts to yield perfectly smooth slices of cake.

Dozens of taxpayers have been waiting years for millions of dollars in tax refunds owed to them on incorrect property assessments, county officials have said. The Democratic minority has repeatedly blocked legislative approvals for the bonding to pay those settlements. Mangano has said structural reforms he’s put in place will end the county’s long-held system of borrowing to pay tax refunds, but can’t begin to take effect until next year. Assessment errors that happened during the previous administration, however, needed to be fixed and made right. Mangano was not at the press conference.

So that's pretty much it for us settling in. We are enjoying our place, and I can put up pictures later. Our photo uploader is MIA so we have been on the lookout for it for the past few weeks. And by the way, our air mattress is awesome. We had a little well deserved fun poked at us when we told people that we were doing it, but it's actually pretty nice. It's a queen, and it's one of those raised ones that looks like it's two mattresses on top of each other. You only have to put a little more air in every few weeks, and the pump is inside it. Anyway, it's way better than we thought it would be. We have been streaming TV shows from time to time on our computer which is in our room, so it has also been doubling as a couch.

After some debate, Andy and I decided that for a filling, a lavender-infused white chocolate ganache would be divine. I have to say, the white chocolate may not have been the best choice. I would have liked something maybe less sweet, to complement the light sweetness of the macaron shells. A bittersweet chocolate would have worked beautifully. Overall, though, I am very proud of my maiden voyage into the world of macarons, and I hope to be able to duplicate these results much more in the future!

Dear Joe and Vicki: Do you use a cover over the front of your car to keep dirt and gravel from damaging it while towing? Have you ever used those shields that ride in front of the car?
Better late than never, right?? I'm writing this post at 10pm on Friday night so it is still Friday :)

I am certain that many of my readers are already objecting and thinking about all the freedom that we have in God’s grace to live like we want. Well first and formost God’s grace does not allow us to live like we want. It certainly covers our sins but God’s desire is for us to commit everything to Him. Our health is part of everything. God calls us to live disciplined lives. When we are obedienent to Him God bestows blessings on us. I am certain that if we give ownership of our health to God we will see a healthier and more vibrant church. I would love to hear from you on this issue. Let me hear your thoughts. Thanks

As we address these evils, and are disheartened by the pathetic condition of Christ’s church, we need to take heart just as Nehemiah did when he first got to Jerusalem. What a mess it was in! Talk about looking at an impossible job. Enemies on every hand and all the defenses down. Demoralized people. But Nehemiah, as a true leader sent by the Lord, called the people from gloom to action. ”Come, let us build!” And everyone strengthened themselves and took courage.

My parents have always been avid readers. My father is a big science fiction fan, as well as a reader of assorted locomotive, car, airplane, and motorcycle books that have always inhabited our house. My mother has always read fantasy, mystery, and assorted books on a million different topics, whatever happened to be of interest to her at the time.
is taking place, and how they feel about it.
Except this mini-meltdown didn't hold up to scrutiny. As a teacher and a student I have always believed that classrooms are strongest when the students are of mixed ability. I'd been ambivalent about the test at best, and had chosen not to do any review or prep, not even the materials DOE had posted on its website. No test, I had told myself, could decide whether or not Helen was gifted and talented. Of course she was gifted. Why did I need some stupid test to prove that? If for some reason this test didn't confirm her gifts, not for a minute would my sure knowledge about her way than above average abilities be rocked. It'd be the fault of the test, or the weather, or the proctor, or some other external factor (or, possibly but less likely, that she'd had a bad morning), but my surety of her gifts would be unmoved.
Soo anyways thats all i can think of right now....hopefully some of you have enjoyed reading my pointless post once more and maybe even missed me a little bit :P.......
I wanted to help out the best that I could, so my contribution to dinner was dessert. I went waivered on what I was going to make and after a lot of searching and looking online and though books and magazines I came up with cupcakes, but the real question was, what kind?
I have been to a church where every Sunday, people are asked to ‘sow seeds’, ‘make pledges’ to God…I mean, is that not supposed to be a personal decision? Come on!
So I dove into my next book with those thoughts in mind. Have I done it this time around? Not sure. I'm querying with some success, but we'll see if I've done a good enough job. If not, I know my next book will be better. And the next.
I decided to make two pizzas this evening, and still have two dough balls for more tomorrow if we want it. I asked my wife to make some dough in the bread machine at about three o clock so it would have time to prove.
In our last Seurat study, we found real life photos depicting his “Sunday Afternoon on the Ile de la Grande Jatte” and because his composition in “Bathers” is so formal and still, we decided to make a 3D model of this painting.
I have recently come to realize that I am not nearly as stable as I thought that I was. I am not feeling well now and I think that maybe this has been coming for awhile and that I just didn't recognize it...or maybe I did recognize it but I just didn't think it would be this bad.
So, had to tell him he is right, but there is a tweak to what the sign meant. He did not get what alcohol was or the effects. I had to induce that wisdom which made me think…how much do we say?

"As Deep as the Knife Will Go," and "Followed Home, Then Killed," are comically personal to me: as a forensic psychologist for almost 15 years (and this in 7 medium- or maximum-security prisons in 6 states), about half of these song titles are the MOs of the vast majority of my former clients-- someone's been reading FBI Profiler John Douglas-- or watching a shitton of Law & Order: SVU and taking copious notes.
I’ve lost all my creativity since last month happened. I can’t think, I can’t write, I can’t draw, I can’t even talk logically anymore. I barely speak to anyone, I haven’t been able to work on anything without failing horribly or being in severe pain.

Today I'd like to share a card I made with one of my newest stamps from Wee Stamps for Whimsy stamps called Spring Bringer. Isn't she so cute? I've wanted her for so long and finally got my hands on her and just couldn't wait to ink her up. I used Copic markers to color her in and also added some Stickles. The designer paper is by My Mind's Eye called Quite Contrary Jack & Jill. I only have 4 sheets left out of my 24 sheet 6X6 paper pad, eek...... The flowers are by Wild Orchids Crafts and I tucked a handmade pin in the bouquet. Her frame is made using a Spellbinder die, the die behind her oval from was made using a Die-namics Doily die. The heart swirl is my Magnolia which I added Liquid Pearls to. The lace and ribbon is from my stash. And the butterfly is from the dollar store which I added some pearls to.
of “simple living and high thinking.” The idea is that only when we simplify, when we clear away the dust that only complicates the obvious truth, will we be able to discover the presence of enlightenment within ourselves and all around us.
Still more laundry to do and I also want to weed. I am not interested in gardening this year and if you knew me, you would be greatly surprised. We get this creeping Charlie-some call it creeping Jenny. Which ever, it's a bitch to get rid of. And my knees no longer co-operate. I am usually planting annuals and new perennials by now. Bah. Haven't even bought any. Also want to box up tons of stuff to take to church for their annual sale. Even the good stuff. Murano glass. McCoy pottery, antiques and tons of cool crap. I will not have another garage sale. Have done way too many of them. WAY too many. I could take some to the E-bay store but isn't everything Craig's list now? I feel good about this as God seems to be telling me that if I want to simplify my life and make this house a home. That is what I want. No boxes to trip over. And perhaps this will encourage Hunter to repair the walls and such.
These are not the only aspects of our culture that are subduing young Americans and crushing their resistance to domination. The food-industrial complex has helped create an epidemic of childhood obesity, depression, and passivity. The prison-industrial complex keeps young anti-authoritarians “in line” (now by the fear that they may come before judges such as the two Pennsylvania ones who took $2.6 million from private-industry prisons to ensure that juveniles were incarcerated). As Ralph Waldo Emerson observed: “All our things are right and wrong together. The wave of evil washes all our institutions alike.”
It is amazing how small-minded I can be. How it is a constant struggle, to close myself off and live as selfishly as I want.

That woman’s circumstance could be told many times — spouses leave, children rebel, health fails, financial troubles escalate, cars and houses need repairs, landlords are ungracious, bosses and co-workers are uncaring, circumstances are disappointing, and friends waver.

My eldest has always had the waviest hair, ever! He takes after both my dad and I in that department! :) Then as I started sifting through some more photos, I found one of my youngest child taken when he was just 4 days old! It's hard to imagine them being that small...I sometimes wish I could travel back in time to hold him when he was that little! Where did the time go?!?!

That Mrs. H, she does like her deals and because of it we now have a larger flock that has meshed together without incident allowing us to avoid the challenge of raising baby chicks this spring. Luckily, the new gang of hens has been very submissive to our originals and no serious squabbling has taken place. The new birds are very happy as their old digs left much to be desired. The weather was nice enough the other day that they even ventured outside for a while, their first taste of freedom no doubt. Unfortunately, today's colder weather has somewhat tempered their enthusiasm for the great outdoors.
But this represents the run of the mill right-wing defense of their bankrupt ideology: find an "enemy," prove that it has halted some progress, and blame it on the left. That's the right's only political idea anymore. I mean, watch how it works:

The picture is taken from the Burrow Hill cider brandy website, and I suspect the author of the petition, Edward Temperley, is a relative of Julian Temperley who runs Burrow Hill. On that page, the 6% farmhouse scrumpy sells for £6.80 for a 4-litre container, which is 28.3p/unit, well below the proposed 40p minimum price. As I doubt whether Burrow Hill is small enough to qualify for the small producers’ duty exemption, others must be able to sell it for even less.

Howdy! I have had quite a productive weekend that has left me feeling quite satisfied with my sewing progress. Right after work on Friday I headed up to Joann's to dash in and grab a half yard of pink and white striped fabric...to replace what I bleached. It did not take me long at all to reassemble the bag and add it to the finished pile. One more thing I can cross off my to-do list. So here's that:
I constantly struggle with getting my kids to eat healthier. Food with Kid Appeal has a wonderful post about making Rainbow French Fries. How fun! I know my kids love the novelty of sweet potato fries, so I think these might be go over well with my kids too.
I am strengthened by the memory of how you lived your life. Your graduation from Wayne State University at 50 years young-as you would say-continues to inspire me to strive forward regardless of artificial age limits. Thank you for showing me how to change and become strong enough to obtain my goals in life.
While in Paris, I did step a little out of my tea-salon comfort zone and explored other stores as they appeared on my walks. One that drew me in a couple of times was Dammon Frères over by the Place des Vogses. After careful sniffing and studying, I picked three teas to try back home (plus a gift for someone who needed a professional thank you). One is the Réglisse pictured at the right above--a black tea so strongly scented, I keep it double wrapped and hidden in its own drawer. (It's insane stuff.) In brief, here's my impression of Dammon Frères: How I wish I had bought more. The tea is earthier, so the flavors aren't quite so bright--and that's not a criticism. These teas live in the shade of a forest and the shadow of falling light. Since they aren't available in the States (as far as I can tell), I see an overseas order happening either now or when fall comes. I'm thinking now since "Soleil Vert" (the gifted tea, which the person opened right then and shared with me) is one of the most beautiful I've ever tasted. For me, that's worth the high cost of shipping.

Do you ever get the feeling that we live in a society that encourages immaturity through escapism, various distractions, and an emphasis on youth? Do you suspect you have not fully matured in your own life? If so, an interesting book, Dare to Grow Up: Learn to Become Who You are Meant to Be by Paul Dunion ($16.95, Bartleby Press, Savage, MD, softcover) is a soulful new guide to personal accountability and emotional maturity. This book is about a self-examined life, offering counsel on how to develop self-loyalty, avoiding self-betrayal, and developing a solid foundation for emotionally intimate relationships. In short, it is about integrity and when you have that, your life is vastly improved. I normally am wary of self-help books, but this one is well worth reading.

“After visits to Maryborough and some other Australian towns, we presently took passage for New Zealand. If it would not look too much like showing off, I would tell the reader where New Zealand is, for he is as I was, he thinks he knows. And he thinks he knows where Hertzegovina is, and how to pronounce pariah, and how to use the word unique without exposing himself to the derision of the dictionary. But in truth, he knows none of these things. There are but four or five people in the world who possess this knowledge, and these make their living out of it. They travel from place to place, visiting literary assemblages, geographical societies, and seats of learning, and springing sudden bets that these people do not know these things. Since all people think they know them, they are an easy prey to these adventurers. Or rather they were an easy prey until the law interfered, three months ago, and a New York court decided that this kind of gambling is illegal, “because it traverses Article IV, Section 9, of the Constitution of the United States, which forbids betting on a sure thing.” This decision was rendered by the full Bench of the New York Supreme Court, after a test sprung upon the court by counsel for the prosecution, which showed that none of the nine Judges was able to answer any of the four questions.
For Assistant DA Jamie Brock protecting her clients means prosecuting criminals not offering them a deal. When she crosses path with an infamous defense attorney on trial for the murder of his wife, she finds herself between a rock and a hard place. As he attempts to bring the justice system to its knees by convincing prisoners to reject deals and demand speedy trials, Jamie must face a compromise that not only affects the people she’s sworn to protect but also her own life as the execution of the man who murdered her mother may be in jeopardy.

It is clear to me that in today’s context, the lever to move the world, or should I say equity markets, is free money. Sure, central banks don’t have a choice when the new orthodoxy is for governments to pursue austerity with great fury but it’s also expressly meant to lever the stock markets of the globe out of their doldrums.

A heartfelt thank you is wonderful, but I would ask that Americans take it one step further. Thank a veteran after Veteran's day. Listen to them, Let go your preconceived notions of what a soldier is and reach out to them, give them opportunity, give them jobs upon their return so that they may preserve their dignity. I say this because the unemployment rate of veterans is twice that of the nation. This simply should not be, and it expresses beyond words, how the majority of Americans (in the position to give jobs) really feel about those willing to give so much to others.

The last time I remember seeing her, she was on an oxygen tank. We played chess and I had to move her pieces for her. I was twelve and in sixth grade when she was put on the iron lung. It was close to Easter when the news came. I'd just gotten home from school and my mother was waiting for me in the kitchen.
Like many novelists, I’ve benefited from publishing’s paradigm shift. I spent years working with agents and pitching to New York editors. The number of compliments I received on my novels could stuff a kid’s lunch bag for a month. Yet the elusive prize of a publishing contract never arrived. I didn’t fit the structured genre mold.
Hlongwane claimed in his confession, ruled admissable by the Bench, that he had ‘stabbed Mrs Alice Lotter twice with a pair of scissors in the neck because she owed me money”, after she had refused to pay him. Before the murders he’d gotten himself drunk at a local shebeen with his comrade Joseph Khumalo, they had returned to the farm and he had gone inside the farm house to argue with Mrs Lotter. He had submitted this statement to magistrate Smith in Wesselsbron three days after the double-murder.

Grief is such a personal thing. Everyone deals with it differently. I won't lie, these last 10 days have been really rough. I'm not going to get into all the details but I feel like I am starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Today was Coach's Scott's Memorial Service. So I think its the day when the healing begins. I expect to have more good days than bad from here on out but I'm still thinking that there WILL be bad days. I'll cross those bridges when I come to them.
I've had this ridiculous anxiety in my tummy and would not be able to find a happy place until this email came. But I told myself it was fine.
A good attitude, even when you get discouraged or things get difficult, is huge. Optimistic views can drive a person to do things never before believed or seen. Keep hustling, and telling yourself the ‘right career’ will come along at the right time. (The right time isn’t always what you feel it should be.) Don’t act like you know everything. Be teachable. Listen more than you speak when contacting an employer or interviewing. No one wants to hire a know-it-all or a critical spirit.
Postscript: I made a return trip to the National Gallery a few days later to reacquaint myself with Constable’s classic. It’s just as stunning as I remember it (although I can’t help thinking that the Hay Wain itself is a little out of proportion to the width of the millpond – sorry Mr Constable, everyone’s a critic). As I stand in the crowded gallery, gazing at the canvas and thinking ‘I’ve been there’, every detail inspires memories and the painting springs to life even more vividly than before. And I realise that’s why The Hay Wain is John Constable’s finest, most celebrated work.

Obviously Judge Dredd is the man, especially in the hands of John Wagner. But character-wise, personally I always preferred Johnny Alpha. I loved his quiet stoicism. He just deals with it, lets his actions speak for him. Still waters. An amazing reversal and cliffhanger could be as simple as him delivering the line: "You get the girl. I'm going to stop the execution." And you just know it's all going to kick off next prog!

Why didn’t the Twelve retain their authority after Acts 15? They were to minister to Israel first and because Israel rejected the offer of the kingdom, God could no longer use them; that is, until He resumes his prophesied program with them in the Kingdom.

Researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology tried to replicate this effect, with success. They created this pattern by first making a polymer, and vaporizing water, letting it condense onto the polymer, and letting the water droplets sink into the polymer, creating even, uniform, aligned bowls. They then microscopically dusted the polymer with layers of titanium oxide and aluminium oxide, and the result they turned out with was comparable to what was found on the butterfly. The researchers also found that under a polarizing filters, the yellow light from the wing and polymer pattern did not show, leaving only the blue light.
Hello there! I am back with a little Magnolia birthday card. It seams to be a clutter of birthday parties at the kids day care at the moment so. Many cards for little kids are required from my boys.

We have to take a trip to Hot Springs tomorrow for Shans appointment so during that trip I will make a list of purchases that I want to make for my kids.

At this time, I think it may be appropriate to remind the new leadership of VOM they are more than a Voice of the Martyrs, they were called to be a voice of the Lord Jesus Christ, and more than the “servants of the persecuted church”, but the servants of the Lord Jesus Christ. And as such, their loyalty is to be to Him, 100% without any consideration of covering up sins in order to protect the ministry.

I had so much fun yesterday. Yesterday was May 1, or “May Day,” as it is commonly referred to. It was also my carpool buddy’s birthday (Hi Leah). I decided to surprise her by making her a May Day basket, and leaving it on the seat of my car when I picked her up for our morning commute. I had so much fun making her basket, that I figured why stop there?
There's also a special menu for a limited time. The Lorax's Breakfast includes an order of Green Eggs and Ham (eggs scrambled with creamed spinach) served with a choice of buttermilk pancakes, Truffula Chip Pancakes (whole wheat pancakes filled with rainbow sprinkles and topped with more sprinkles and creamy strawberry yogurt) or a Rooty Tooty Bar-Ba-Looty Cone Cake (a fluffy pancake with blueberries in a crispy waffle cone, topped with blueberry compote and sprinkled with powdered sugar). For guests ages 12 and under, two new items headline the Lorax-inspired menu: Pipsqueak's Breakfast, a kid-sized version of The Lorax's Breakfast, and an order of Kraft(R) Mac 'N Cheese & Truffula Trees (broccoli florets). Like all items on IHOP's Just for Kids menu, these meals clock in at under 600 calories.
After asking for my license and registration, Trooper Howard and the female officer went back to Trooper Howard's vehicle to write a citation. I observed the two officers in my rear view mirror for about five minutes. I don't know what was discussed, but I can well imagine – they both realized the truth obtained from my demeanor, conversation and what they could observe of my cargo – this was a bogus report and they had been used by people they thought were reliable and co- law enforcement officers – I refer to the Secret Service – and I'm sure they both also understood they could have been killed by the heavy traffic running only feet away.
Today I am sharing a card I made using this sketch on splitcoaststampers. This was a fun sketch to work with and I decided to go monochromatic. I used always artichoke and very vanilla card stock with just a pop of melon mambo.
I don’t expect us to play like Barcelona, Arsenal or even Swansea, but it’d be nice to recapture the stuff we were playing at the end of last season against Newcastle, Bolton, Wolves, Arsenal etc. Was that really just down to cup final momentum? I refuse to believe it was. I’m happy for us to be muscular and direct in our approach, but there’s no reason we can’t add more strings to our bow. Allardyce’s Bolton gradually added a bit of class through the likes of Okocha and Djorkaeff. Moyes’ Everton were initially very cautious and physical. But the more we spend and the more established we get, is it really ungrateful to hope we can approach games more positively? To try and create a bit from open play? To play the odd through ball from midfield instead of having a defender boot it up to a target man every single time?

Semi-accurate portrayals:
Among the softcover novels is Gothic Spring by Caroline Miller, her second novel, ($15.95, Koho Pono). Victorine Ellsworth knows something about the death of the vicar’s wife…but what? Is she the killer? Or the next victim? It is a journey into a mind that is unraveling. She is a young woman poised at the edge of sexual awakening and cursed with more talent and imagination than society will tolerate. The conflict between her desire and the restrictions that rule her life lead to tragic circumstances arising out of the death of the vicar’s wife. The Caribbean is famed as a place to vacation, but for those who live there, it can be a challenge. Dr. Alvin G. Edwards has played a role in the popular Caribbean television series “Paradise View” while also a medical practitioner who resides in Antigua. Now he’s an author as well with Once Upon An Island ($14.95, Author House). It is a fictionalized account of events experienced by friends, family and others concerning a family that leaves Jamaica to start a new life on Antigua, but who discover the transition isn’t as easy as they had thought. Life on a new island comes with the same problems as life on the larger one, particularly if the legal systems leave something to be desired. The author’s island is fictional, but for a taste of life in the Caribbean, this novel is probably as close to the truth as you will experience.
Unlike years past, it seems the full-length came correct these past twelve months. Besides the punk-as-fuck all-killer-no-filler Women In Prison EP (some kinda Consumers/Saints buzzbomb on Hozac), not a whole lot of contemporary singles blew my head off (def. really dug the Circle Pit 45 on Sweet Rot; like a lost Royal Trux Sub Pop Singles Club entry from ’92, and no I don’t feel “bad” for mentioning the Trux re: Circle Pit again; if the shoe fucking fits, but I digress…..), but there were a slew of good-to-great LPs, and that suits me just fine, cuz I’m lazy.

The history of the shop is a long way back since 1952. “Kaew Sri Morrakot” is the last name of the owner, which is his grandfather. At the early year, there is truly just a food stall. Now aday, the shop owns their own more than 500 sq. ft. traditional-look restaurant! But when it comes to the taste, Khun Wanlop, present owner of the restaurant, mark his word that it is as good as the same on the first day food stall shop.

I miss my little gab sessions with my good friend Denise and my endless laughing sessions with my Brazilian friend.
Of course we understand that western nations want to retain the nuclear advantage but as a Nationalist I cannot fathom quite how you justify telling a sovereign nation, "Hey, you will not make the educational, technological, financial and security developments that this technology brings becaude you are different to us and that scares us". This is in effect what is happening. What needs to happen is that the whole world needs to realise that nuclear technology is a global game changer and one heck of a planetary responsibility. Nations who have it need to restrict the movement of the technology and nations that develop the technology need to be helped to face up to the responsibility that comes with it. Without interfering I am sure that Iran can be taught much for example about the containment, transportation and ecological management of nuclear material. International mentoring on these and other non military issues would be helpful to everyone.
Now you may well have rightly guessed from this that the dozen or so submission packages I've sent out so far have not yet hit pay-dirt. In fact, the response has been consistent in its anonymous negativity. No, I'm not taking my bat away in a huff not will I rant that agents are short-sighted. (Because they're not.) And I have a long way to go as I've only begin to scratch the surface of the W&AY. But the auguries are not good. But, like the way people get in a state about idiots on the internet, I have decided to shrug it off. Not because of complacency or superiority. So far, nobody wants my second novel. But it's no big deal in the bigger scheme of things. I'll keep going but if all avenues end up as dead-ends, I'll finally know if this latest offering needs more work or impaling with a stake. So what? My writing output is infinite as long as my health holds up.

It always feels good to help others in any way possible. However, I know a lot of us have a busy schedule and may be unable to dedicate enough time to help them. So why not just run? You might not be able to join volunteer activities from across the country, but surely, running a few kilometers will not eat up too much of your time. You could finish it in less than 2hours. And in that short time, you have already helped create a lifetime change for someone.

This post is also a bittersweet one as it is my last one for Our Daily Bread Designs as my Guest term finishes at the end of July. I have been truly blessed to have been able to create and share with this amazing group of women and I will miss each of them very much. Thank you so much to Kelley and Judy for inviting me into the Breadbasket, I've had a wonderful time and I'll never forget this time with you all! Thanks to all the girls and although I won't be part of the basket any more I will certainly be frequenting your blogs!!!

I had mentioned at some point at John's parents house about owning a pizzelle iron... his dad got VERY excited about this fact, so I had to make him a batch! His dad also really likes dark chocolate, so I adapted the recipe to include some dark chocolate cocoa powder. I made sure to bring some into work as well to share the crisp goodness.

When we first took on the job, we were told that it could take as long as twelve hours to do it. We knew it would take awhile, but we figured between the two of us that we could knock it out in half that time and still have done a better job than is usually done in this particular store. As it turns out, that was wishful thinking.

Author’s note: This is a rough, unedited version of something that’s been floating around in my head for a while. I’m putting it up here as motivation to keep writing, and I’m aiming for an update every two days. Sometimes the updates are shorter in length. Feedback is awesome. Parts 1-4 can be found earlier in the blog.
Das Racists’ first two mixtapes, released in 2010, were perfect summer records. It was actually the summer of ’11 that found my circle of friends soundtracking warm, aimless nights with “Rainbow in the Dark” or “Hahaha, jk” and the group’s ironically-ironic careless attitude already feels nostalgic in the way that summer records do after just a few months. Now in the winter of 2012, we have the first solo mixtapes from Das Racists’ core MCs. Heems (Himanchu) has filled his first outing independent of the group, Nehru Jackets, with a lot more to discuss than his counterpart, though I may get around to a review of The Palm-Wine Drinkard eventually.
His school friend summed up our point nicely by chiming in, "I try not to really learn anything during summer break" with a shrug. What he means, of course, is that he doesn't do anything schooly - no reading of textbooks, no writing of reports after reading a good book, no creating a diorama to explain that cool documentary you just watched. And therein lies one of my biggest beefs with the way school operates. Schools would have us believe that learning happens only when you are being taught by someone else. They'd also have us believe that it's "work" and "a kid's job" and "very serious" and other such sobering things. And in school - it is, usually. Even the younger grades get less and less fun as the push for higher test scores and earlier reading takes over.

H.R. Giger is in my opinion, a mad genius. I own a couple of his "coffee table" art books, and they are scary stuff. I own Biomechanics, H.R. Giger's Alien, and his Necronomicon. In reading about him, I discovered that within his lifetime he has rubbed elbows with just about every major artist in the world including Ridley Scott and Salvatore Dali. He's had a girlfriend that committed suicide, is the atypical primadonna with huge demands and uncompromising work ethic, and is notoriously difficult to work with.

Based on my internet research, I think the older Jesus Trail is the better hiking trail. The Jesus Trail has better support services for hikers, better trail markings for navigation, and better access to water, food, and supplies. It has more Christian and historic sites and provides much better interaction with locals and the diverse cultures in Galilee.
We get out and decide to take a nice a drive through the back country down old roads to see the beautiful scenery and cool off. We still don't know everyhting about BC and haven't seen much as we came straight from Ontario and then the shit hit the fan I guess you would say. This is where the mayhem comes in.

Grayling says the DWP is committed to implementing improvements “to try to make this a better and fairer process”. He adds: “The only alternative to this is to leave people on benefits for the rest of their lives, doing nothing.” Farmer stresses that Mind is also in favour of helping people into work. “We are very strong believers in the idea that people with mental health problems can and should work where that is possible … but we also know that there are huge barriers to finding work,” he says.

Your super smart. You still ask a million questions about everything. I know this is a good thing, but when I give you answers you question those and then I’m left repeating myself 3 times until you accept the answer I give you. I just love when you ask where something is, and then why it’s there, and then well how did it get there, or who put it there. I DON’T KNOW!!! You want to know who builds buildings and who put roads in certain places, and why a store doesn’t carry something.

The Monroe Institute is a non-profit education and research organization devoted to the exploration of human consciousness. They have been studying consciousness for more than 30 years. In more recent years mainstream science has taken to studying consciousness, people who meditate and how it affects them. Just recently Massachusetts General Hospital released a report, Benefits of Meditation in the Brain, where they found that people who meditate actually have structural changes in their brains in as few as 8 weeks and that, "changes in brain structure may underlie some of these [cognitive and psychological] improvements and that people are not just feeling better because they are spending time relaxing,". Pretty interesting stuff going on these days.

That willingness made me hopeful that we could skip preschool this year. Over the summer our family moved to a new city and the potential for non-preschool socialization opportunities seemed high. We now have the great fortune of living in a neighborhood that is crawling with kids of all ages. There are strollers in abundance and tire swings hanging from multiple trees. During our first couple of weeks, Pip had begun to make a couple of friends at the playground nearby. He was talkative and playful and seemed to be figuring out how one goes about making friends.

Currently, I'm working on a jacket & skirt. The jacket is B5531 and the skirt is from the Vogue pattern mentioned in the previous post. The fabric is a stretch bengaline from Fabric.com. It's been in my fabric collection for maybe a year. Last night as I was pressing darts in the jacket, I noticed that this fabric seemed to have more stretch than I thought. I hope it will wear well once complete. I think I would have chosen a different garment for this fabric. This should be finished by the weekend so I'll have pictures to show.

My life is going through a major transition. I’ve learned so much the last couple of months and have had some “life impacting” changes take place: for the better. People have entered it, and some have needed to take the big red “Exit” sign we’ve become so familiar with in public places. Everything that happens in my life I have always tried to look at it from a standpoint that they happen for a reason. I am at a better place now than I was a month ago, a year ago, and 5 years ago… I’m a better person. I am beyond a loss for words for the feeling I have inside of where my future is headed. When someone enters your life, there are several ways that you can approach that “moment”: with open arms and embracement or rejection. I, however, tend to see what purpose people may have in my life, as well as what purpose I may have in the lives of others before I come to any conclusion. I’m forever grateful for those that have remained a part of my life, but I’m also grateful for those who are no longer a part of it. Without them, I would not have become who I am today, that and of course not without my God, family, and personal experiences.
Anyways quick summary of Light: pretty boy (I’m pretty sure he spends more time on his hair than I spend on mine though admittedly that’s not saying much), genius (and he knows it), arrogant (though he deserves to be… somewhat), and super into dancing. That last part is actually due to me; I dragged him to a dance event at the end of our sophomore year. He got hooked and is now a waaaaaay better dancer than me. I’ve known Light since my freshman year; he essentially lived in our suite (being the boyfriend of one of my suitemates) and we stayed friends the rest of college (some semesters we hung out more than others but yeah).
The normal ruckus is going on around me – kids screaming and jumping, tramping up and down the aisle. Sometime later a body falls into my seat, knocking my book from my hands. I look up and angrily shove them out, sending them across the aisle.
Set this aside to cool. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Sift the flour and baking soda together. In a mixing bowl, combine the butter and condensed milk till smooth. Add one egg at a time while continuing to mix, till all 8 eggs are incorporated. Then add vanilla. Fold this mixture into the sifted flour. Then combine the sugar/water mixture. Pour into a springform pan that has been greased well and lined. Bake for about 45 minutes and a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean. Cool the cake, completely, on a wire rack. Slice and serve! You could drizzle orange blossom syrup over this cake and it would just take it over the top!

What else grabbed the eye in Lichfield? Well the local park has a statue of the Captain of the Titanic. Lots of wreaths laid around it to mark the centenary last week, but it’s not quite clear why the statue came to Lichfield (they say his home town didn’t want the statue after the disaster and Lichfield being the nearest cathedral town… really???).
So what I was able to find out so far: I'm not positive about any of this, but, I believe the property along the river was originally owned by Bard College. The area north of the college has trails & bridges throughout and on some of the trails you can even get a guide from the college. I'm not entirely sure if the college still owns the land or the state??? I haven't actually been able to find out anything about the barn except that they are considering fencing it in to keep the vandals out. WHO ME??? I'm a scavenger, please, there IS a difference!
The restaurant is very expert on Bar-B-Q pork, Crispy Pork, and Chinese sausage.

Aza has really kept me busy playing golf. I can safely say that I probably played over 50 rounds of golf this year. I am shooting in the low 80's now on a consistent basis and Aza is shooting in the 90's. I am so proud of her, she practices so hard and really tries to improve every round we play. I'll tell you what I absolutely love about her. I will get off work and come home to find her decked out in her golf gear looking adorable telling me to get dressed it's time to play some golf.

- Comfy nursing bras. I used my nice ones the first few days and, oh my goodness, once my milk finally came in, they ended up being a little too supportive. I liked the sports bra style of nursing bras better the first few days. There are no words for the pain of engorgement when your milk first comes in.
You and your family will love these. Mr. CC and I had to stop ourselves after two each. We could have finished them all. Give them a try and let me know how they turn out.
Changes to an already approved and published book (where the problem was not caused by UKUnpublished) will require an additional charge, however, this will simply represent the cost and time involved, and you will always be notified prior to any charges being accrued - although this is a very rare occurrence.
Why aren’t people making a fuss about that use of the swastika in the context of lots of high-powered weapons being on display and for sale in the suburbs of Auckland? That’s scary dude; much scarier than some perceived slight to Rottweiler Rodney. He is thick of hide and skull and tough enough to take that kind of political jibe.

Twelve by Nick McDonell is a book I had hanging around the bookshelves for quite a few years; the author was heralded as the new Bret Easton Ellis/Jay McInnery; it follows a few eventful days in the life of White Mike, a yuppie drug dealer in New York; I liked it, it had some really good characters, including two guys who try to talk like black dudes (they are white) and of course come off completely ridiculous;

I bought my boots about 3 years ago now for about $125 and had them resoled. That means over 3 years I have about $150 or so in them and I’ve worn them many, many times. Every occasion from school to church to even in a suit! If I had bought new casual shoes every year for different styles I would have much more than $150 tied up in shoes. On the other hand I am a proud owner of Vibram Five Fingers KomodoSports (as well as Vivobarefoot Neos). Now, you probably see the high cost of these and think “Psh! How are you saving money by buying barefoot shoes which are extremely popular right now?” Well, first of all, I started wearing minimalist shoes before they were popular. I am a firm believer in their benefits because they’ve helped me in my running and overall fitness. However, barefoot shoes tend to actually last longer than normal shoes. I know a guy who retired his pair of Vibrams after 2,000 miles. 2,000 miles! Show me any regular running shoe that can do that! If it holds up to that many miles running, you can bet that you’ll be able to wear them around the house for a long time before you need to replace them. Barefoot shoes have less material to them and no padding. That means that they’re actually more durable in most cases. I’ve found that they last longer than the normal shoes I used to wear.

Another key area is research and development. Companies that embrace R&D have a better chance of developing products and processes that set them apart and give them an edge in the competitive global and domestic marketplace. The dollar can help here as well, by enabling cheaper purchases of some of the sophisticated equipment and technology necessary for world-class R&D.

I mean, come on. Look at that cover! It's so pretty, I want to take it places and buy it things. But, even more, inside the covers is Valentine's sly, deft, luminous prose.

but enough about me.
Only a few possibilities have been entirely ruled out. We can't predict overall emissions of radioactive particles. We can only monitor and try to be accurate in our assessments of what the actual levels are, so as to respond when and where needed. One further generalization is that with multiple agencies and groups monitoring radiation levels (such as in the US), we can trust the public findings.
And let it perplex no one that Matthew says that the Chief Priests and elders of the people came to the Lord, and that he connects the whole of this discourse in one down to this parable of the vineyard, without interposing any other speaker. For it may be supposed that He spoke all these things with the Chief Priests, but that Matthew for brevity’s sake omitted what Luke mentions, namely, that this parable was spoken not to those only who asked Him concerning His authority, but to the populace, among whom were some who said, He shall destroy them, and give the vineyard to others.
Details of police monitoring used for the first time during the tournament were discussed at a privacy forum in Wellington yesterday, at which it was revealed that the average person is digitally recorded about a dozen times a day – and even more if they use email and social media frequently.
The fact remains that we are in the midst of religious war, whether we want to be or not, or whether we even know it. Our enemies have decided that this is a war of faith, so it is a religious war that we must fight. If nothing else, the atheist fights to preserve his right to believe in No-God.
Marko Hamlin’s story encourages me to continue writing, and speaking about child sexual abuse prevention and awareness. It ministers to me, that we can put a gap between the current statistics and lower the number of men and women who have these haunting stories of child sexual abuse.

“Just off the coast of the northwestern United States, not even 100 miles from where we now sit, lies the Cascadia Subduction Zone. It stretches beneath the Pacific from Canada’s Vancouver Island down to northern California. There is evidence several massive quakes have erupted from this region over the past 3,500 years. Each was followed by a tsunami. It last happened at around 9:00 P.M. in the year 1700. To this day, it is believed to be one of the largest known quakes in history, and the subsequent tsunami ravaged the entire coast.
Finally with a deep sigh, I choose to be a purist and stay on the trail. A soft voice behind me speaks, “That darned integrity thing again.”
The two sweaters on the left were handknit and felted the best. The remaining three woolen items were commercially made; the orange jacket (formerly salmon, don't know why the color changed) is the only woven item and felted the least. I might run a couple of these through the process again.

Sebastian too hides his cautious fears. Will they find a place for him on the team? Will he be teased, humiliated. He wants to be accepted. He wants to go home for Thanksgiving, a hero, a complete man, accepted and comfortable in his surroundings. He wants to assuage his mother's anxiousness by regaling stories of acceptance. He wants that pin on his lapel and a bunch of mates to wolf-whistle with. He wants one of those cheerleaders. Particularly the beautiful Cindy Cowan. Every time he sees her walk into the cafeteria she's flanked by admirers, cool and reserved but with a confidence that makes her shine. He hears music that isn't there, and feels the breeze brush through her blonde hair. He imagines her naked, firm, nubile and receptive. His imaginings get away from him so quickly he's often missed class choosing to remain seated rather than expose the erection he's developed obeying his fantasies. Yep, he'll pledge. Maybe then she'll look twice.
While the economy is covered by the business media, newspapers, magazines, and cable channels, it tends to get short-shrift in the mainstream media because there well may be a shortage of reporters who actually understand economic trends beyond the very obvious.
The HTC One X camera actually comes out as the better performer in low-light conditions thanks to its bright F/2.0 aperture.

Pritchard said “my pace is improving with each event as we get used to competing again following a ten year break, and learning about the car more and more.

I still remember the first time my son made this cake. The recipes in this cookbook are geared towards countries where metric measurement and Celsius temperatures are the norm. He didn’t read carefully enough and set the oven at the first temperature indicated, which was 180° – at that time he was not experienced enough of a baker to know that most cakes bake at 350°. Once we figured out why it was setting up and turned the temperature up, it turned out just fine. In fact, I think that first cake was moister than any of the ones he has made since.

This morning “the baas” (that’s me) had to help this pompous dude fix the lawnmower tractor – again! He was too afraid to inform the caretaker (his real baas), because his real baas was on the verge of firing him, apparently on the grounds that he had already received three disciplinary warnings for gross negligence related to the “mistreatment” of the lawnmower, and also for disappearing from his workplace to visit the liquor store during working hours.

Alexander Graham bell invented the first telephone and everyone knows it because we learned it on Schoolhouse Rock and our teachers pounded it into our heads. Actually…Antonio Meucci displayed a working telephone in 1860 that he called the “teletrofono.” In 1871 he filed for a temporary patent on it. In 1874 when the time came to pay the $10 fee for the patent, for some reason he didn’t. Speculation is that he was in poor health and destitute because he put everything he had into making working models of the teletrofono. Maybe that is why, maybe not – it’s one of history’s mysteries.

We need to have more senior people, male and female, talking openly about the ways in which they carve out time in their lives for their families. And, of course, we need more senior people actually doing it.
Family's important. I wasn't too appreciative when I was younger, but the past few years have given me a real change in perspective. I sure appreciate them now with all the support they've given me over the years. I wasn't always encouraged to pursue a dream, but I was always encouraged to work hard. I'm just finally putting the two together, working hard to pursue a dream.

What is rhubarb? Rhubarb is a perennial vegetable that originated in China, eventually being grown in Britain and then the US. Rhubarb was something I had only heard of until I moved to Pennsylvania. It likes a cooler climate to grow in and shows up in the local markets in the Spring until early summer. It is quite tart and requires a lot of sugar compared to other fruits. I like tart and tangy, and rhubarb does not disappoint.

After our ‘Where is Spot’ experience we headed off to the New York Public Library to see the inside. The library is beautiful inside and out. It looked very classical with its white marble and Greco-Roman pillars (not dissimilar to the White House). It has lovely paintings and cool looking ceilings too. They had an exhibition of some photos or the other, which was not memorable on the whole. They did however have a series of random photos of a collection of 111 Polaroids of Polaroid cameras, which were cool to see the evolution of.
Third Point of Fact: Our dear Phebe is not just fan service. In some ways she is the ideal prepper's girl, a thought that I did not ignore when I was working out her outline. She has prepared due to parental influence, is competent with her own weapons systems, and is a level headed and practical person with a good heart. But I am taking care to make her human as well (though so far your only clue is that she gets pit stains, one thing that never happens to chicks in the movies no matter how many abandoned streets they run down) and she and John are going to have some hellacious conflicts in the story to come.

After my set, Rayanne and I got our dates out of there as fast as we could. We headed to a last bar for the final nightcap of the evening. Rayanne and Miguel chatted. I headed outside with Carlos because he wanted another cig. Another hour or so passed and the sangria flowed. At the end of the night, Rayanne and Miguel exchanged numbers. Carlos offered to accompany me in a cab back to my place. I had had a few and was becoming blinded by the items on the Dollar Menu, so I said yes.
The biggest problem anyone can make when TEOTW begins is that you are not prepared, even a backpack with a filter, knife, and maybe a solar panel is still better than a bath robe, tennis shoes, and a couple outfits. The average person usually has only one week of food in their house. So prepping requires at least two months of foods for your family and a planned place to ‘Bug Out’, which I will tell you about how to do.

Much of the Parisien chattering class now awaits a reaction (if any) from the Elysee Palace security operation, either confirming or denying that the call took place. But the hotel’s affirmation that it did puts them in a tricky spot – especially as L’Observateur last week printed a story based on persistent rumours that Sarkozy ‘knew about the charges facing Dominic Strauss-Kahn even before he was hauled from his Air France flight at Kennedy Airport’. Liberal-facing magazine Marianne asked ‘Is the Elysée under the Sofitel carpet?’ a question barbed by the knowledge that Sofitel’s owners the Accor group enjoys close ties with the ruling UMP party. ‘‘There is an issue about what they did with the information,’ the periodical claims.
“We shut him off, and sat down, worried and disheartened, to see if we could think up some other scheme. We shortly hit upon one which promised well, and this one we adopted, and set its machinery going at once. It was this. Lawson must give the dinner. The Faculty must be notified by telephone to prepare. We must all get to work diligently, and at the end of eight hours and a half we must come to dinner acquainted with New Zealand; at least well enough informed to appear without discredit before this native. To seem properly intelligent we should have to know about New Zealand’s population, and politics, and form of government, and commerce, and taxes, and products, and ancient history, and modern history, and varieties of religion, and nature of the laws, and their codification, and amount of revenue, and whence drawn, and methods of collection, and percentage of loss, and character of climate, and – well, a lot of things like that; we must suck the maps and cyclopedias dry. And while we posted up in this way, the Faculty’s wives must flock over, one after the other, in a studiedly casual way, and help my wife keep the New Zealander quiet, and not let him get out and come interfering with our studies. The scheme worked admirably; but it stopped business, stopped it entirely.

Last year about this time you could not read a single printed word about the NFL draft with out it inevitably leading to a backhanded remark to the potential number one pick, Cam Newton. It began with the inflammatory comments about Cam’s willingness to be a star, entertainer, and icon. From there it snowballed to an all out assault on his character. In the end it had very little effect on his draft position as he went number 1 overall to the Carolina Panthers.
To use these functions, there is Display-function, that takes the temperature and divides the tens to first display and ones to second.

The main story also recalls the past, with its roots in the Cold War. To say much more than that would reveal too much of the plot.

But my father’s family, who live in Panipat, had different ideas. The first-born son of each brother in the family had to have a name beginning with the syllable ‘Vi’. It was a family tradition. My father’s eldest brother had named his first-born son Vijay. My father’s second brother had named his first-born son Vinod. What was all this Amit nonsense? They vetoed the name and told my parents to think again. The name Amit (written in ink) was crossed out on the green birth certificate and the name Vikram was pencilled in. And since Kolkata is possessive of its children, although I am not Bengali, I have once or twice seen myself referred to in newspapers here not as Vikram, but (I am proud to say) as ‘amader Bikrom’. And I for my part certainly consider this city to be ‘amar Kolkata’.
I have long admired Jenny's works, but this quilt really took my breath away. To give you and idea of the size of this quilt, I was at a quilt show earlier this year and as I walked between the rows, a man standing at the end of the row caught the corner of my eye and I did a double take. It wasn't actually a man, it was this quilt, hanging at the end of the row. When you stand looking at the quilt, he is basically life sized and the way the quilt was hung meant that you were looking at him in the eye.

“Reading both old and modern herbals as well as more recent books on wild food, it is fairly common to come across various plants referred to as spring tonics and blood purifiers – nettles, cleavers, watercress and chickweed are good examples. As a teenager, these vague terms used to drive me mad (before ultimately driving me wild!), unable as I was to see their relevance in a world where, as far as food supply was concerned, there appeared to be no seasons at all or, rather, there seemed to prevail one ceaseless monolithic season of eternal plenty, one long continuous produce perfecting summer. Unquestioningly taking this to be the natural and best state of affairs, the very idea that local, seasonal plants – let alone wild plants – could act as nutritional restoratives relative to a period of depletion and deprivation seemed anathema, even in some way insulting, having no resonance or relevance with regard to my health, eating habits or prior experience and lifestyle. In fact, I had become spoilt, blind, lazy, stupefied and unaware, living in a bubble unchallenged and unresponsive to nature’s dynamic seasons with their inherent change, challenge and delightful unpredictability. Ironically, it is now this very awareness of ceaseless change, transition and unpredictability, of responding to the creative challenges thrown up throughout the wild food year that so stimulates and excites me, that ultimately helps me to feel fully energised and alive. Wild foods in their abundant seasonal variety now serve as hard won year-long counter-tonics to the former dumbed down and beguiling supermarket crap that I used to consume.”

Niikam looked up nervously at the approaching city gates. Guards in tan, bulky armored suits stood with angry steam guns propped in their arms. He shivered at the sight of the weapons. He had felt the singe of those once and that was enough. Niikam briefly glanced at his companion as they made a straight line for the closed gates. Jesphan looked ahead, his eyes focused and unwavering. What had the city heard of this stranger? What would be their reactions to a company such as theirs? Some cities were willing to accept outsiders for the right price, but others…Well, by the look of those steam guns, Niikam was not about to make any hasty decisions. He side-stepped behind his companion, trying to hide his lanky frame behind the man’s stouter figure.

But fate is a curious player who abides by no rules but his own. One day, quite unexpectedly, my childhood friend called me. To add to the surprise: She wanted to set me up on a date.
b) I can't describe what I'm doing/thinking at any given moment in short phrases. Right now for instance I'm sitting in my bedroom eating a banana, typing and watching the traffic go by. I'm also analyzing the pattern of shadow created by light coming through the screen on my window. It looks especially lovely matched with the note I scribbled out on the back of a bright pink expired coupon. Oh look a goose just flew by. Back to the coupon, I'm really glad that I started tearing up old bits of paper to use as notes instead of relying on a dwindling supply of post it's. I keep on loosing the packages before I get a chance to use them. Loosing post it's is a minor tragedy because I actually have to spend money on them. Of course it's less stressful to lose little bits of torn up copy paper. I've been saving bits of paper that are too dark to write on as well, for art projects and admittedly horrible attempts at making paper cranes.

I cannot tell the difference between the deuce and a half and the snow plow, their engines sound too similar to me.

Trim the roots from the radishes, and pare off the greens, leaving ¼ to ½ inch of the stems. (This is mostly for looks, and for the slight flavor the stems bring, but if you want, you can completely trim away the greens.) Soak the radishes in cold water for about 15 minutes to loosen any dirt trapped in the stems. Drain and scrub the radishes. If any are more than 1 inch in diameter, halve them.

I turned up to see three odd but stylish looking pumpclips; Out Landish Pale, Out of Step IPA and a Mild made with fruit which escapes me now. (never have my camera or note pad when I need it!) The beers came from Offbeat Brewery, which started up in Novemeber 2010 in Crewe. I went for the Pale straight away, and it did not last long. It's a beautiful sessioner. Think Buxton Moor Top or Thornbridge Wild Swan, but with a bigger bitter bite. At 3.9% it's probably got more character about it than most of the other beers in this catagory coming from he UK, I could have drunk it all night - but there was others to try.
That day, after we ate, we joined Chiron for his chores. It was easy, pleasurable work: collecting berries, catching fish for dinner, setting snares. The beginning of our studies, if it is possible to call them that. For Chiron liked to teach, not in set lessons, but in opportunities. When the goats that wandered the ridges took ill, we learned how to mix purgatives for their bad stomachs, and when they were well again, how to make a poultice that repelled their ticks. When I fell down a ravine, fracturing my arm and tearing open my knee, we learned how to set splints, clean wounds, and what herbs to give against infection.

In a large dutch oven over medium high heat, brown beef and drain off any excess fat. Add onion and cook until just translucent. Add garlic and peppers and cook until garlic is fragrant, about a minute. Add all seasonings and beer and cook a few minutes, stirring until foam subsides. Add tomato and bring a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for an hour. Add beans and cook about 45 minutes, or until chili is thickened. Serve with cheddar cheese, sour cream, cilantro, lime, whatever floats your boat for a garnish.
“Eternal God, who are the light of the minds that know you, the joy of the hearts that love you, and the strength of the wills that serve you; grant us so to know you, that we may truly love you, and so to love you that we may fully serve you, whom to serve is perfect freedom, in Jesus our Lord.” (Prayer of Saint Augustine)
Yesterday when we walked in, the two older kids greeted Mrs. Robin with an "Arrr Matey!", while little Weston, hesistant all morning, finally growled out "Arrrrg!" :) I had to laugh at him.

The case law, and boilerplate arguments taken therefrom, is quite extensive: well over two hundred different cases are included. Of special interest to me was the fact that almost a third of them are BPAI decisions. So when thumbing through the cases for a Response to Written Description rejection, you'll find not only a Federal Circuit case saying "drawings may be relied on to support the claims," but also a BPAI case standing for the same proposition. Thus, you can pick the case that fits your facts better, say, one related to drawings in a business method application rather than a mechanical application.

A young engineer named Art Nielsen was finding it hard to sell his concept of measuring sales by count­ing cans on drugstore shelves. (Yes, the term bean counter was coined to refer to Nielsen’s auditors, who counted cans of Campbell’s beans for Nielsen’s first customer.) On a train ride on his way to make a sales pitch, Nielsen came up with a concept to overcome the objection he often heard from prospects: “We’re doing just fine. Sales are good.”
If you haven’t been to Teatro ZinZanni, the décor is impressive in its over-the-top old-world theatricality. Equal parts cabaret, gypsy tent, and bordello (but in a G-rated kind of way in this context!), you can easily imagine you’ve walked into the Moulin Rouge at the turn of the 20th century. Moving from the lobby to the antique Belgian spiegeltent that houses the main performance space, it struck me that this could well be the Grand Ole Opry of Seattle’s kindiependent music scene.
If a friend stops by while you’re working, simply tell him/her that you’ve scheduled this time for spring cleaning. He or she is free to stay, as long as you could continue working. Perhaps, you might even get some help. If not, tell your friend you’ll stop by his or her house later on when you’re done.
Weakness: Teams in Norfolk St’s situation need to be able to shoot the three reasonably well to stay close to higher seeded teams. Unfortunately for the Spartans, they don’t do that. They’re only shooting 31.4 percent from behind the arc, a stat that has to be troubling for Spartan fans who hope their team can spring a monumental upset. Teams will load up in the paint against the Spartans and if they can’t shoot from outside, they’ll be out early.

Top tip: residents of the 17th arrondissement get in free this weekend if they come with a copy of the free ParisDixSept magazine. I can’t guarantee that this will work, but if you go first to the Mairie du 17eme (on the Rue des Batignolles) and pick up a copy of the magazine in the entrance you’ll probably be able to get in free too.
It’s ironic that the most traditional RPG this year is top dog and it so deserves it. Level 5 did an incredible job with the graphics engine and it seriously looks like something right out of a Dragonquest anime. The voice acting is superb and the plot is really damn good. It’s also punishingly difficult. One cannot just…walk into Dragonquest 8. No no, one hobbles, groaning and holding closed an open wound from where your asshole was split wide open by that ONE battle with way too many goddamn enemies…and wouldn’t you know, it most likely was NOT a boss battle.
There’s a whole lexicon of technical terms relating to the topic; aboulia, ego depletion, apd, etcetera etcetera. The jargon stretches across the realms of psychology, physiology and psychiatry.

As we were getting ready to leave, my father took me in his arms and held me for a very long time. Someplace in my heart I heard a small voice questioning my decision to leave this place.

I bumped into my old friend Knister, a German author (published there, like me, by Arena) who has sold 17 million copies worldwide of his Lili-Hexe (Lily the witch) stories, without finding a UK or US publisher so far.

Test refusal also carries administrative penalties.

But I didn’t say anything about this. Chalk it up to cowardice. Better, I thought, to say nothing, or even offer insincere praise, for a book by a fellow atheist and a friend-of-friends, than risk making enemies of someone with whom I’m allied in many ways. But I was uncomfortable with this, for it’s intellectually dishonest to critique those books by religious people, or people whom I don’t know, and then give a pass to a book that I didn’t like just because it was penned by a fellow atheist. So now I’ll speak out: I didn’t like A Universe from Nothing, and I think that there are other things to read that do the same job better. It wasn’t a horrible book, just a mediocre one, and has all the earmarks of being written hastily and not edited properly.

Although the outcome of this year’s renewal was as thrilling as it possibly has ever been, it is evident that modifications still need to be made.
I can hear the chants as the crowd shouted “Allah hu Akbar” (meaning, God is great) as they threw the stones. I can still see the stones as they were hurled against her, one after the other, blood gashing off her forehead, deep wounds inflicted on her beautiful face. They stoned her to death. The man she was supposed to have committed adultery with was even given stones to throw at her so that he could ‘reclaim’ his honour. One after the other the stones flew. She screamed, cried, groaned and mourned until her voice and strength ebbed away and she died.

Different states may have different guidelines so go first to your state's website. You'll also need to find out if your county/town has any permits or licenses you need to have. I was lucky in that I called the VA tax department and a nice lady clarified what was really necessary for me to do. It made my day that I actually got things done on the phone with the government! How 'bout that?

As he started to walk towards my car I was letting down my window & I started to go on complaining about how I needed to get my car back right away, how I couldn’t keep waiting etc. He didn’t even really acknowledge any of that (lol). He IMMEDIATLEY took me out of the state of frustration by looking and gazing at me with a flirty grin and then telling the loony who was stalking him to “hold on for one sec” and before I could say anything more he leaned in closer to my window and said “You look like you’d go for this. How bout this, I jump in drivers, you scoot to over to the passenger’s side, and I’ll aero plane off these cars in front and we can both escape from this hell?” LOL! I just let out this big ass laugh and he stood there (still in his solid frame with a slight smile and that knowing look on his face) while I giggled and laughed for about 30-40 seconds. The flirting continued from there once he saw I responded favorably. I also kept eye contact with him.

Kuwaiti authorities justified the oppression saying the protests were not “authorised”. Some stateless activists tried to get permission to demonstrate but their requests were rejected. The Interior Ministry has repeatedly stated that only citizens are allowed to protest. It also claims that the brutality demonstrated by riot police was merely a response to violence by protesters.
Last year was a particularly bad year for tomatoes as Late Blight was rampant in the Northeast, but I was vigilant. Every day I was out in the garden checking the plants. I picked off any diseased leaf or stem and disposed of it properly (for Late Blight this means bagging in a black plastic bag, sealing it and setting it in the sun for a few days to kill off the spores). I still had a good harvest. My potatoes were also infected so when I harvested them I made sure to get every last one of them out of the soil. Late blight can't over winter here except on live plant material. For us this means potatoes left in the soil. I even double dug that section of the garden to make sure no potato was left. If one potato overwintered and came up in the spring it would mean that my garden would be reinfected. Not everyone last year was as good as I was. There are already reports of Late Blight overwintering in potatoes in Pennsylvania and Maryland. An outbreak is already starting. So this year we may have issues again. The Massachusetts extension service has a page up to help you identify and tell you want to do.

I've been playing around with Sketchbook Pro Copic.

I recently invested in a Wacom tablet and I really love sketching on the computer. It makes the cleaning up process so much simpler.

Thankfully my daughter has attached herself to such a special man.

The debate continued to wage at the Schechter Rabbinical Seminary, with two female rabbis quitting the institute, one in opposition to the ordination of gay rabbis; the other over the hesitation shown by the organization in accepting gay and lesbian students into its ranks. I don't know who the rabbi was who quit over the hesitation of Schechter to ordain openly gay students, but I think the rabbi who resigned was Einat Ramon, who opposed the ordination of openly gay and lesbian students, and who even thought that there was no place for gay and lesbian Jews in the Masorti movement in Israel.
It is only relatively recently that I have discovered the wonders of the slow cooker. The first few times I used it I was extremely skeptical. Basically what do you MEAN I just put all the stuff in the pot and leave it alone for six hours??? and No, really, I swear nothing’s happening in there — we’re never gonna have dinner! But lo and behold, slow cookers really are a thing, and not only do they make easy meals that are ready at the end of a busy day, they cookforeverwhich allows for great tastes and flavours.

In my previous posting, (Limpopo Province – A Heritage Under Siege), I promised to cover the true facts concerning this significant occurrence in the history of the Limpopo Province – South Africa. My initial motivation for writing about this event is based on the old saying, --- “you can take the Savage out of the bush but you cannot take the bush out of the Savage.” The year 2010 is fast approaching, but yet the impulse to perform Ritual Murders and other barbaric acts still remain an integral part of the African culture. This is evident in the horrific nature of violent crimes committed by these Savages.

AND she even put obscene language in the book – and that was another no-no to Trafford.

At 9:30 PM as we headed back to our tents from my campfire reading of a short & spooky Stephen King story, we encountered this Copperhead snake just off the trail 15 feet from my tent. While clearly on alert and aware of us, the snake was not at all agressive ( and I was impressed that my young campers did not freakout in its presence. The ranch owners relocated it away from our camping area. These images ( taken with a flash) do not show how amazingly well camouflaged this snake was among the leaf litter. Even with flashlights shining on it, many people had trouble seeing it at first.

They will do so knowing that much of the world shares a mindless, baseless hatred for them, but they share a collective memory of having survived far longer than those empires and tyrants that tried to destroy them and failed.
In the video (and let me just say, combining pretty people and video seems like a no brainer and yet I see it so rarely), these intended “random acts of kindness” are shown. One example includes handing out flowers to strangers. Okay. Fine. My apartment building gives all of its tenants a single rose on Valentine’s Day and I admit, it brightens my day for a few minutes and makes me forget the exorbitant rent I’m paying is also paying for the stupid flower.

The first album, The Money Store, will be released on April 24 and feature the songs "Blackjack", "Get Got" and "Fever (Aye Aye)". Music videos have been released for all three, as well as the track "Lost Boys" alone with no video accompaniment.

I don’t have anything else on my mind especially. I’m not distracted. Even the bird’s being reasonably quiet at the moment – he’s hanging off the edge of a picture frame hammering the wall which is good for him (yesterday we had about six hours of car alarm practice). I’m playing a nice floaty score by Ennio Morricone, nothing bombastic or even especially melodic to be honest, the room is bright enough and warm enough without being so warm that I want to nod off and I’ve been fed and watered; my hunger has been assuaged but I’ve also not eaten so much that I feel the need for a wee kip. So, why can’t I get my head around this poem? Okay, I do have a bit of a headache but I’ve had a headache now for several weeks; other than that I have no more aches than I usually have. I’m used to working through headaches and even if I’m in real pain I’d rather be occupied than lie around feeling sorry for myself. My glasses need a clean. So, let’s go and give them a wash.

It has been a rough road for commodity bulls since September 2011 and particularly since 2/28/12. Look at the weekly chart of the Reuters $CCI Index. If this week continues as Monday began it would be the 9th week in a row that the CCI index has posted losses. 8-10 record sessions imply that the market is oversold enough and sentiment is poor enough to warrant a bottom of some degree. The same rule can also work on the upside. Too overbought and too bullish after 8-10 up sessions would suggest a retracement on the horizon.

But we went to La Bellevilloise to experience the cocktail bar at "La Grand Prairie." During the summer months, the loft - normally used for movie screenings, shows, etc - was transformed into an outdoor space indoors. Deck chairs, free-standing hammocks and plants were strewn about the plastic-grass covered floor giving the loft a beachy/picnic feel. The temporary bar, following this ambiance, was stocked with plastic cups and a very limited supply of booze. With no vermouth and no actual glassware, I skipped my usual first order of a martini and went straight for the daily special (strawberry caipirinha) from the menu written in magic marker on the window behind the bar. Nothing was fresh, nothing was top shelf, nothing was particularly interesting about the bar offerings.
I’ve studied lots on how to generate ideas and overcome writer’s block but personally, I’ve never been short on ideas. My next three novels are imprinted firmly in my mind’s eye with thumbnail sketches of the characters, plot and settings for each. I have a writer’s bin where I keep all ideas, including titles and key phrases for stories or novels as well as any superfluous work I might have edited in the past. A bit like the loft, it’s important never to throw anything away. You never know when it might come in handy.
The diameter of the coin is 23 mm, and it is fairly heavy for its size. The core of the coin is made of bronze and it is covered with silver in order to give the illusion that it is pure silver. One side of the coin depicts the profile of Athena, the patron goddess of Athens, and the other depicts an owl, the goddess’ symbol.

Mirza, the hero of our story, was born to Fateh Bibi and Wañjal while Sahibañ, the heroine, was the daughter of Khewa Khan. As already explained, since Fateh Bibi and Khew Khan were suckled by the same woman, Mirza and Sahibañ ended up being “cousins” according to the prevailing traditions.
Technically I'm not reading this, I read it a few months ago, but even if I'd read it a few years ago, I'd be completely remiss not to share it with as many people as possible. It's easily one of the best books I've ever read.
After our ears had frozen off, we decided to continue our tour in the car. I was amazed as I drove deeper into the neighborhood, to discover street after street of gorgeous new condos and apartments built along the narrow streets that twist and turn closest to the bluff. From the hilltop, you can see the Detroit-Superior Bridge, downtown, the river, and the collection of industrial waste that lines it. Once I made a wrong turn that took me onto the road that heads down into the industrial wasteland and had to turn around and come back up. The condos are gorgeous, but I wonder what the view is like. Can you see all that junk down at the bottom of the hill?
While they did that I tidied the kitchen, and explored some math myself. I used graph paper to draw out the image of the cake being divided up over and over and then another set of graph paper to draw a Fibonacci spiral. The kids had learned about Fibonacci spirals already from Doodling in Math and because the figures look so similar I wanted to make sure the kids notice the difference. In one you alternate drawing rectangles and squares. In the other you draw just squares (which joined with the previous squares makes a rectangle.)

Yet, the curse showed it’s power when Favre and the Jets lost 4 of their last 5 games and shockingly missed the playoffs after being “locks” for much of the year. Favre never played for New York again and Eric Mangini lost his job after the collapse.

Just wait till you see what is in store for you all this time !!
We were up at 5 a.m. when we gathered in front of an altar and sang a devotional that is called Arti. It was the same song over and over again every day and one of the lines was … rights and rituals won’t reach the goal! However, if that was true then why were we all engaging in the same ritual day after day? After we sang Arti, we would then have an hour of meditation. I remember sleeping through most of this because I was exhausted from only getting five hours of sleep a night! However, there were a few times when the light would explode in my third eye. Please don’t be confused by this, as it is nothing more than an occult practice that has deceived millions of people for thousands of years. It is nothing short of a demonic light show and is one of deception.
Deep frying requires a deep fryer or other device in which the chicken pieces can be completely submerged in hot fat. The pieces are floured as above or battered using a batter of flour and liquid (and seasonings) mixed together. The batter can/may contain ingredients like eggs, milk, and leavening. The fat is heated in the deep fryer to the desired temperature. The pieces are added to the fat and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process.

My family attended a game once where Mario Soto relieved Bruce Berenyi in the first inning. Soto then went on to pitch a gem. I don't remember all of the details - and I should go do some research - but I do know that years later I was chatting with a co-worker while living in Ohio and I discovered he had attended the same game with his family.
Some of you may be thinking I only comment one or two days a week anyway, because I’m not a comment junkie. You’re right. I don’t always leave comments and when I do comment, I sometimes forget to check the little box to get the email notices of follow-up comments. Okay, sometimes I forget on purpose, but only about a third of the time but I’ll leave you to wonder why. There needs to be a little mystery in life.

Everyone was super thrilled as you can imagine based on my last post. Well mostly everyone. When Von told my youngest nephew Jamison that we are having a strawberry girl, he said that he wanted a chocolate boy. So everyone other than Jamison was thrilled!! Camden was super sweet, he hugged me and as always I wanted to pick him up but I couldn't because he's a big boy now and I am pregnant. So when I said to him, auntie wants to pick you up so bad but I can't, he said "because the bun in the oven?" I said "yes honey" then he said "and you don't want to hurt the bun?" It was so sweet!! Needless to say, that night was a lot of fun. My family always has such a great time together.
It is not that I abhor violent action (although I do), it is simply that it is fundamentally and inescapably ineffective at achieving its stated goals and unparalleled at creating catastrophic unintended consequences.
My latest venture in crafting is heat embossing. I love to add that extra luxe touch to dress up a simple, blank notecard. I will admit, it takes practice to get the right amount of ink, powder, and heat. I have also burned my fair share using the wrong kind of heat sources. I finally decided to purchase a heating tool and turned to Martha Stewart via Michaels Craft Store.

“Why should you think that beauty, which is the most precious thing in the world, lies like a stone on the beach for the careless passer-by to pick up idly? Beauty is something wonderful and strange that the artist fashions out of the chaos of the world in the torment of his soul. And when he has made it, it is not given to all to know it. To recognize it you must repeat the adventure of the artist. It is a melody that he sings to you, and to hear it again in your own heart you want knowledge and sensitiveness and imagination.”

Many projects aimed at creating skills and self-employment opportunities are in operation in South Africa, but most of them are struggling to reach levels of viability where they can provide an adequate income and where services are not undercut by the formal economy or by imported goods. A process of out-sourcing and casualisation of labour is taking place in the formal sector. This reduces demand for labour by large formal businesses and substitutes it with the input of small businesses and the self-employed, usually at much reduced income levels and with poor job security.

For example, it’s perfectly acceptable to walk on the street in 8 inch platform rhinestone stilettos and a mini dress when it’s snowing. Preferred, even. This last week alone I saw a Bentley stretch limo, a neon orange Cadillac Escalade and a sleek matte-textured Jaguar. Today I saw a lady at the gym wiping her butt sweat with a Louis Vuitton towel. There’s a chance that once a tiny child next to me on the bus had a grill, though it could have been something else, it all happened very fast.

Some people’s faith may be imagined by your easy life compared to others difficulties. Perhaps you don’t struggle so much because you were born into wealth, earthly that is. It really does not matter how others appear to be, but that we stop making excuses for not trusting God, and just do it. Are you paralyzed by doubt? I don’t care how impossible things look, how many failures, I have experienced, how spiritually dead I felt at different times in my life, how much it appeared the Lord overlooked me, I know without a doubt that God is still the God of the Bible. His Word confirms he is my God and he loves me, no matter how abandoned, unloved and insignificant my untamed imagination portrays me as being. That makes my spiritual walk a success. All we need do is stop wallowing in doubt long enough to receive our rightful inheritance, from God.

In an attempt to solve the mystery and save her town, Rebecca must willingly open herself up to unknown and unseen dangers that are lurking deep within the computers. To her disgust and horror, the virtual reality she encounters is controlled by real evil, meaning she must draw her strength from real faith and take a stand. But, the hairs on the back of her neck prickle, as she thinks about her lack of attention in Sunday school and nodding off during Services. Had she absorbed any knowledge, strength, or faith? If she found others wandering inside, would they have the will to stand? Rebecca will soon find out as she's put to the test, for in the world of Omniverse, there are no restarts or saves. Fight against it, for if you give in, it is Game Over.
Here are some pictures I took before the big moment, isn't this hotel gorgeous?
There is something weird about this place. I wonder why she has all those babies and the children, where did she find them and why doesn’t she give them to the orphanage in Shattrath where I’m sure they would have it a lot better. Cause I’m not sure she really cares about these children as there can be found explosives in the sandbox and why is there rotten meat in the doghouse? What about those cages behind the house, whose bones are in there? And why are those small baby taurens hanging there and spinning around? Wish I could save them all, especially those taurens, cutest thing I’ve ever seen.
Another thing that I do for my personal amusement is move random objects around on people and then feign complete ignorance. Keys, cups, glasses, cell phones… whatever…. I’ll just pick them up from one place and deposit them somewhere else. I’ll sit back and watch my victim go half out of their mind trying to find said item, then scratch their heads befuddled by how the object ended up where it ended up. The funniest thing about this to me is that the only person who’s ever figured out that I do this is my oldest daughter (she’s actually started playing this game herself, but she knows better than to set her devious sights on the master). I have been doing it for more years than I can even remember, and yet I’ve never been caught snickering in the corner… that in itself just about kills me every time.

2) False-Positives Can Be Managed–Just as in disease detection and medical diagnosis, there can be false-positives, and we manage these by validating the results through repeating the tests or performing additional corroborating tests; so too with pre-crime screening, false-positives can be managed with validation testing, such as through interviews, matching against terrorist watch lists, biometric screening tools, scans and searches, and more. In other words, pre-crime detection through observable cues are only a single layer of a comprehensive, multilayer screening strategy.
We had the strangest weather last week--it snowed on Sunday but started melting on Monday. We had 2 days that were around 78 degrees then it was below freezing again at the end of the week. We were under a tornado warning on Thursday evening--or was it Friday evening? I don't remember--how sad!!! We has such high winds on Friday and Saturday that it was hard to even walk outside. Things were blowing into our yard from who knows where.
This rule stems from an earlier version, which used to mandate that that anyone practicing law in New Jersey had to maintain a bricks and mortar office within the state. However, the New Jersey Supreme Court later changed the rule, today requiring New Jersey lawyers to simply have a “bona fide” office located anywhere.

Number 2: (Notice as I’m writing about not taking life so seriously, I’m still making lists about it—Virgos RULE!) It’s International Women’s Day! I’m torn about this day, though, because before today, I was under the impression that every day was women’s day. I mean, I know the system is patriarchal, but really? We get ONE day? Huh. Foregoing the negativity, I have decided I will embrace International Women’s Day and will make my mark by doing something that is considered out of the box for me!
The only thing the devil can do is deceive, manipulate and cause confusion. Only you can allow him in. If he gets in then you serve a God who is up 24 hours a day, seven days a week and his line is never tied up. God is your CPR, your 911 in the time of distress. We all have a wall to tear down but God will do it for us if we believe him to do it.
Their sound is informed by Ultimate Spinach, Stone Roses, Clinic, David Bowie, Roxy Music, Pink Floyd, Pixies and Broadcast (whose song Michael A Grammar gives the band their name).

Have you ever been disappointed in the process of getting to know someone only to find they have real issues with integrity? Think how disappointed God must be in His children, who are saved by grace, when they fail to repent and call on the power of the Holy Spirit to help them deal with character issues.

Flirty tip 3 Laugher. Guys like it when a girl laughs but they don’t like my laugh because my laugh scares them. Laugh gently, laugh softly and be a little shy about it. Don’t laugh with force, don’t start convulsing, don’t fall on the floor, don’t start crying. Not crying cause you’re laughing so hard but actually crying just to switch it up and see what happens. Don’t do that. And definitely, don’t whip your hair around and then pass out because that just scares people.
Along the way, he comes to rely on the assistance of one of the most complex and well drawn characters I've ever read, Lisbeth Salander, the "girl" of the title and a consummate computer hacker and investigator. Together, the chemistry, the intelligence, the skills combine for what might be called a "ripping good yarn." And yes, it has a couple of pretty grim sections not for the faint of heart. But they are essential to the plot (not gratuitous) and move both story and character along. These might be tougher in the movie, but I was fine with them on the page.

I finished the school semester about a week and a half ago, which was a relief but also strangely depressing. I've talked before about how it's hard for me to go from 10,000 miles per hour and total craziness while classes are in session, to suddenly skid to a stop and have all this free time and little structure on my days. The solution to avoiding the post-semester blues, I've found, is to stay busy. It's a bit of a delicate balance as I clearly need a vacation and some decent rest, but I really am happier - not to mention more productive - if I have full days even during the first weeks of summer break.

That being the case, it'd be stupid for us to jam each other up over the petty stuff, knowing that we might need to rely on each other later in the shift or the next day. Now that doesn't mean that I overlook felony-level stuff, or drunk driving. I won't do that.

And to be honest, the writing life is not conducive to a fit, healthy body. We sit all day at our computers, maybe getting up once or twice to go to the bathroom. This isn't good for the waistline.
