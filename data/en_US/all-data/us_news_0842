Nicklaus was a 21-year-old amateur in the 1961 U.S. Open at Oakland Hills, and he was one shot behind playing the par-5 12th as he made a run at Gene Littler.

Of course, underage moviegoers finagle their way into R-rated movies all the time. But that's less likely to happen with "Bully," not because of the theater owners' tough enforcement of the rules but because it's hard to imagine a group of 15-year-olds saying, "Hey, let's go to the art house and sneak into the hot new documentary about bullying."

Did we really need the Green Lantern, Captain America, Thor and the X-Men mere weeks apart at the multiplex?

One of the most popular group trips is a four- to five-day wilderness excursion on the River of No Return with the rafts stopping at natural hot springs and resting on sandy beaches. Jared Hopkinson, who runs the Sawtooth Adventure Co., told us, "I dig watching people push themselves. There is a lot of bonding, and families become lifelong friends.

Two midwives have agreed to a $5 million settlement with a couple who sued them for medical malpractice after their baby suffered permanent brain damage, an attorney said Monday.
Chou's English is so tortured that when he tells Britt that his father was "a complex man," it sounds like "compact man." Slo-mo "bullet time" action beats during his fights make him come off better than most of his co-stars. The homoerotic Chou-Rogen buddy banter doesn't put either of them in a good light.
The idea of more unkempt vacant lots and parks with overgrown weeds and grass troubled several council members.

Just then a clap of thunder thwacked à la Macbeth, and guards began herding visitors to a gate far from the one I'd entered.

Meanwhile, I let fly on the ride of a lifetime around the temple.
And it's not that unfamiliar after all. It seems to me that slam poetry springs from the same motives that inspire actors in improv or the early filmmakers who made a new movie every day. You don't sit around waiting for the grant or the option or the perfect venue to fall into place. You make art like bread, every day, because it tastes best when it's fresh. Who knows? It might be something wonderful.

The development stalemate was ominously foreshadowed in a 2006 audit commissioned by then-incoming Mayor Cory Booker and the City Council, which warned of the need to address a host of "challenging issues" and "shortcomings" for the arena project to succeed, and push for ancillary development "so the downtown core does not simply end up with a one-team hockey arena surrounded by surface parking lots."

They are the new lights on the weary avenue - places selling Chinese takeout.
Back at the Alyeska before bedtime, I sign up for the Northern Lights wake-up call in case they become visible over the resort. I wanted to see the Aurora Borealis in the worse way, but I have no such luck on this trip. So I make the most of daytime activities. I take a spin with a snowmobile (they call them "snow machines" up here), navigating through Chugach mountain valleys and around gold mines and creeks. On days when the snow permits, you can explore ice caves and see icebergs. And I take a "flight-seeing" tour, zooming close (but not too close!) to clear-blue glacial ice and waters.

He expects to have plenty of company.
"I think that's one of what was important to us when Jared came here," Matta said. "We knew he was going to be a special player.

The filmmakers were able to capture a fairly remarkable occurrence which becomes the heart of the movie. A young chimp in the clan (arbitrarily named Oscar for personification purposes) is orphaned and shunned by all the other adults. That is until the alpha male (arbitrarily named Freddy) uncharacteristically adopts the young chimp and raises him as his mother would have. Seeing that this is a Disney production, the cutesiness factor gets ratcheted up to 11 thanks mostly to the serviceable, if not occasionally heavy-handed narration by Tim Allen.
"To stop a run like that, you usually have to put the ball on the floor and get to the free throw line," Drake said. "With the way they play defense and how athletic their guards are, it was tough for us to do that."
Christie, a former U.S. attorney, and Plousis are connected through politics. Both are Republicans appointed to law enforcement positions by President George W. Bush.

"We feel like we have some people ahead of them right now," Showalter said of Bergesen and Berken. "Berken is tough because he got behind the eight ball with the leg. But we'll see. Hopefully, they can pitch well and present an option to us as starters. It's not like they are going away. They continue to be, hopefully, some depth for us and impact our club. That's gonna kind of be up to them."
Tuesday, Oct. 2-Sunday, Oct. 14: "Anything Goes." Music and lyrics by Cole Porter, original book by P.G. Wodehouse, Guy Bolton, Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, new book by Timothy Crouse and John Weidman. The Roundabout Theatre Company's Tony Award-winning revival features some of Broadway's most beloved standards, including "You're the Top" and "I Get a Kick out of You." Rachel York -- who previously wowed crowds at PlayhouseSquare in "Kiss, Me Kate" -- is back in the role of evangelist-turned-nightclub singer Reno Sweeney, the part originated by the late, great Ethel Merman. York gave a surprise command performance Tuesday at the annual Broadway season launch inside the Westfield Insurance Studio Theatre. Dressed in a bright fuchsia gown, she belted out the title song "Anything Goes," then confessed to her longtime love affair with the composer. "Nobody writes lyrics like Cole Porter," she said.
California has had the funding to commission a study focusing on lane-splitting in recent years. "I'm guessing," Smith said, "less accidents from lane sharing than from all other motor-vehicle against motorcycle accidents."
Lori Hartley, a social worker from Mount Laurel, asked Christie what policy beliefs make him a Republican. He gave her the short answer: less government, less regulation and fewer taxes. Those policies, Hartley said out of his earshot, are hurting the lower class.
A: We've been in and around Clackamas, and Vancouver, and downtown Portland. We're going to be possibly up around Forest Park. All over the place. The locations are so amazing around Portland that some of the writers have flown up (from Los Angeles) in the last couple of weeks to look at locations and get ideas based on locations.

"He hijacked it," Court said afterward. "That said that everything that people thought about up to this point should be treated differently now."
That's insane.
The New Zealand-set, coming-of-age quirkfest "Boy" proves as slight as its minimalist title. Like the film's lead character, a scrappy 11-year-old everyone calls simply Boy (the wonderfully expressive James Rolleston), there's potential here. But writer-director and co-star Taika Waititi ("Eagle vs Shark") never builds much momentum for his largely uneventful if sometimes inventive story.

Another cost: Perception. To outsiders, St. Louis can appear smaller, poorer and more violent than it really is. The 134-year-old split of St. Louis city and county - and the city's loss of more than 500,000 residents since 1950 - means that our namesake city bears a disproportionate share of the region's problems.
Chuck West, president of the Newark Firefighters Union, called it a "great day" for the department.

The findings come as studies continue on drugs to treat HSDD. "There is still no FDA-approved treatment," Kingsberg said. "It's still a double standard, a gap in women's sexual health versus men's sexual health."
Look toward flyover country, where the Tigers added Prince Fielder and may well pack even more punch than the Yankees do, where the Royals and their ballyhooed farm system are expected to produce a legitimate major-league franchise for the first time since before the strike, where the White Sox still have some arms and the Indians had enough to own first place for four months last year, where the Twins are starting to get their version of the M&M Boys back.

By comparison, a barrel sample of the 2010 Rubicon is notably different: bigger and fuller of roasted fruit, thicker and ropey in its texture, with evident oak presence and a slight awkwardness. It could be a sign of a tricky vintage, but it could also be the sign of a wine in transition.
Average attendance (3,260 last season) is terrible. CSU must find a way to generate and sustain interest in college basketball in downtown Cleveland. Butler will no longer be coming to town, and that was the Vikings' biggest crowd every season.

“I have no doubt in my mind,” Crowell said. “The only thing that would hurt Mike on the next level, it’s a faster game, much quicker, but I have no doubt he could start at Maryland next year. He needs to get a little bigger, a little stronger, but as far as being ready to play. I think Mike’s one of those rare guys that could step in. I really believe that.”

For example, Best Buy International chief Shari Ballard's options to purchase 32,325 shares at $39.59 per share expire in November 2013. That means Best Buy stock would need to rise more than 45 percent over the next 18 months for Ballard to make any money. But it would be unusual for a stock to jump that much. The S&P 500 index finished 2011 flat: So far this year, the index is up over 11 percent.

The Corzine-Katz relationship had been a popular political sideshow in New Jersey from just about the minute Corzine announced in December 2004 he would be seeking the Democratic nomination for governor. As a separated and then divorced U.S. senator, Corzine had dated Katz for two years, ending in June 2004, without news coverage or controversy — mainly because the union local she led rarely if ever crossed paths with Corzine, who was focused on his position on Capitol Hill.

Lawmakers have yet to settle on any single health care plan. But several ideas being discussed could be a boon to private health insurers, especially if the eventual reform does not include a public plan to compete with them. Obama reiterated his support for a public plan but did not insist on it, and industry analysts think the idea will disappear eventually. That helps explain why analysts don't think the insurance industry faces any serious threat from the Obama plan.
The College Board also released data on Oregon student performance on Advanced Placement exams. The number of Oregon students taking exams in 2010 increased nearly 12 percent.

Pakistani civilian and military leaders now profess to be shocked, yes shocked, that Osama bin Laden was found in a suburb full of military retirees, less than a mile from Pakistan's military academy and just 40 miles from its capital, Islamabad.

Hey, you'd be crazy to doubt the guy. But surely it won't be as easy as he made it sound on Friday. He has major surgery and a ton of work ahead of him, and even if it all goes well, you would have to think the injury would take some type of toll, especially at such an advanced baseball age.

“There’s no replacement for those starts and those snaps, that game experience,” Ludwig said, noting that Katz still has to earn the starting job. “One advantage he has is that he has been there and done that.

They and other Democrats believe Speziale’s hiring was brokered by Passaic County’s GOP chairman, Assemblyman Scott Rumana, and approved by fellow Republican Gov. Chris Christie under a scheme to weaken Passaic’s Democratic ticket. Democrats control Passaic’s freeholder board by a 4-3 margin, with two seats held by Democrats up for election on Nov. 2. And regardless of whether Speziale’s replacement on the ticket, Clifton police Lt. Richard Berdnick, retains the sheriff’s seat over his Republican opponent, a former undersheriff, Felix Garcia, the GOP needs to win just one of the two freeholder seats to gain a majority on the board.

A simple breakfast of milk and cereal is better than no breakfast at all. Try to choose cereals that are low in sugar and high in fiber, such as Cheerios. An even better breakfast is adding a glass of juice, a piece of toast and a fruit, such as a banana. This complete breakfast will meet all nutritional requirements. Parents also can incorporate an occasional meal of eggs and bacon in moderation. Some schools even offer breakfast in their cafeterias.
Navarro said the bills would lengthen the foreclosure process and create costly new rules for state-chartered banks and credit unions, which service few residential loans.

There are some differences. Omega-3 fatty acid levels are somewhat higher in the grass-fed beef. But if someone's getting other sources of omega-3 fatty acids — if they're having fish once or twice a week — the additional amount probably won't make too much difference.

It's equally important for schools to help parents realize that even if English is not their first language, they can make sure that their child does homework and comes to school prepared. Sometimes, if parents are new to this country, they aren't familiar with the role parents play in education here. When schools provide a friendly environment, parents recognize that they and the schools should be partners working toward a child's educational success.

The Michigan primary, coming Feb. 28, will tell us whether Romney is invincible or all too vincible. Both Santorum and Romney say they would not have bailed out the auto industry. Santorum told the Detroit Economic Club last week that the difference between him and Romney is that he wouldn't have bailed out the finance industry either. (Romney supported the bank bailout.) Surprisingly, this brazen appeal to logical consistency — not normally a big vote getter in American politics — seems to be working. Or maybe it's just schadenfreude (pleasure at the misfortunes of others) at work: Auto workers don't mind being laid off as long as bankers are laid off too.
The first tourists to encounter the oil treated it as a curiosity, poking at it with sticks, scooping it into plastic bottles and snapping photos as it glommed onto the sand.

The flamboyant frontman remains the star. His is a voice that could easily play on Broadway: no matter how rough the material gets or how much he hollers, he maintains his tremolo and his pure pitch. If he occasionally sings platitudes (“who says you can’t come home,” “I’m going to live before I die,” many others) and comes on with the subtlety of a B-1 bomber, his broad-stroke painting remains vivid. He hasn’t conceded any of his wattage to the advance of the years, either – his lungs are just as powerful now as they were in the mid-Eighties. This musician takes his craft seriously; he’s in terrific shape, and while he broke a sweat in the late-May heat, he never looked winded.

As these sorts of run-and-gun affairs go, "London Boulevard" is a stylish proposition. With Oscar-winning cinematography Chris Menges ("The Mission," "The Killing Fields") behind the camera, the film is a beautifully bleak brush stroke of contemporary noir, always an appealing backdrop for violent tales.

To view complaints over Mr. Limbaugh's vile attack on a woman trying to participate in our democracy as merely "an attempt to silence the voice of conservative radio" is paranoid and beyond the pale.

Jacob Lernarde said he doesn't have family in the area, so he'll be braving the storm in his Willow Street apartment.
It's hard to explain how deeply that touched me. It's not that I'm a stickler for keeping books pristine--I have the lifelong student's tendency to treat books as necessary objects, tools of the trade, rather than works of art. I write in books, underline things, dog-ear corners (assuming the book belongs to me, of course). So it was not that the book had been marred, but that it had been marked, in some accidental yet permanent way, by the same sacrament it contained.

Then I hit something I thought must've been a concrete pier, even though I was 100-plus yards out in the water. Then my foot started tingling, and I thought, "That was a shark, man! I better get out before I start bleeding!"

Some achievements that can be connected to the efforts of the Occupy movement, and some plans for the near future:
Yes, riders got socked with a 12.5 percent hike last year, and Walder says next year's wallop may be even more than the 7.5 percent spike already planned. But fares have risen steeply in past crises: In 1975, the cost of a token shot up 43 percent; in 1981, another 25 percent. In 2003, amid the post-9/11 economic downturn, the price of a ride jumped 33 percent.

With the emergence of Occupy Wall Street and the Democrats' new emphasis on jobs legislation, the deficit debate has lost some of its urgency.

"The Russians invaded us before, and they are invading us again," Balounova, 50, said from her art gallery in this picturesque spa town not far from the German border, about 80 miles west of Prague. It has become so popular with Russians that most signs for luxury goods and services -- from million-dollar villas to colonic irrigation -- are in Russian.

The "dark time" Schumaker described was really more of a pause in time. The oblique injury subtracted Schumaker from the three-way joust for starts at second, but it's as if the competition waited for him to catch up. Tyler Greene and Daniel Descalso, who split the starts before Schumaker's arrival, have struggled at the plate. Both are hitting .200. The Cardinals' .238 average from the second-base position ranks 11th in the National League, and it sinks to .215 when Schumaker's production is subtracted.

According to the Point Lobos Foundation, cannery partners Gennosuke Kodani and Alexander Allen were following in the footsteps of even more intrepid explorers—the fishermen and their families who sailed to Point Lobos from southern China in the 1850s in 30-foot junks.

Dennis O'Neill saw far more good than bad, though, and said he was willing to bid as much as $80,000 for the son of Flower Alley. "He's got a beautiful leg and a big, long stride," he said.
Mark, Tebow did go Hollywood -- in a couple of ways. He did show up at the Oscars and the Grammys and a couple of other awards shows, and he had dinner with Taylor Swift, but he's a kid who was having a good time (but not drinking). But the main reason he was near Hollywood (on the UCLA campus at Westwood) was to work out twice daily for hours with Bruins offensive coordinator Noel Mazzone.
 Special session after special session. Legislators trying to deal with highly complex issues in a state of 37.3 million within three months (no, the complexity doesn't disappear) will certainly miss deadlines for adjournment. Remember the serial special sessions of the 1960s? That was a major reason voters in 1966 voted overwhelmingly to switch from a part-time to a full-time Legislature.
In the early going, Hitchcock toyed with match-ups again by showing David Backes with Alex Steen and McDonald and showing Patrik Berglund with David Perron and T.J. Oshie. He played a bit of chess with counterpart Todd McLellan before settling on his familiar combinations.

CHERRY HILL — Officials in one of southern New Jersey's best regarded public school districts are upset that they will soon have to compete and share money with a new charter school.
“Each member of the team is extremely important,” Kinser said. “We have a lot of talent on our team and our coaches stress how crucial it is to work as hard as we can because every point is important and can make a difference.”
The conditions restraining Oregon's tech economy --competition from Asia, strategic missteps, a weak environment for startups and Oregon's flailing education system --have long been acknowledged inside and outside the industry.

Later, to be certain that what we were seeing was true cause and effect, we sprayed synthetic oxytocin into our subjects' nasal passages—a way to get it directly into their brains. Our conclusion: We could turn the behavioral response on and off like a garden hose. (Don't try this at home: Oxytocin inhalers aren't available to consumers in the U.S.)

At St. Edward, the school printed up business-card sized, fold-out pamphlets that explain both the athletic department and the school in tiny-font detail. If a coach ever is approached by a prospective student at a game, he has been instructed by principal Eugene Boyer to hand over the card and explain that the athlete should make an appointment to speak on campus.
It was a banner afternoon for Sansoucie, a junior who broke the state record in the 100 butterfly in a time of 48.14 seconds. The mark, previously held by Chris McCrary of Fort Zumwalt South, had stood since 2000.
That would have been the case even if Jim Tressel and Terrelle Pryor were still around, because adding Nebraska to the Big Ten (which became official Thursday) is a game-changer. Too often in recent years, there weren't enough teams in the Big Ten able to challenge the Buckeyes, even if Ohio State was only good and not great.
Even so, Harbaugh seems to relish the task.
NO BASEBALL BREAK
When I planned this visit, I thought I'd hike a bit and be able to watch lava sizzle into the sea. Or perhaps I would take a boat trip to see it. But Kilauea didn't cooperate. The lava flow is constantly changing, park rangers said when I visited last month; at that time it was difficult to see the flaming rock from ground level or from the sea.

The NFA's complaint cited stories in the Star Tribune about Cook and his associates, indicating that they had made false statements about a currency investment strategy.
Zimmerman asserted in an interview last week that the new hires do not violate that vow.
The economic situation during the past 20 years has been unprecedented in the history of the world. You will find no other 20-year period in which prices have been as stable – relatively speaking – ... in which inflation has been so well-controlled, and in which output has gone up as regularly. You hear all this talk about economic difficulties, when the fact is we are at the absolute peak of prosperity in the history of the world. Never before have so many people had as much as they do today. I believe a large part of that is to be attributed to better monetary policy. The improved policy is a result of the acceptance of the view that inflation is a monetary phenomenon, not a real phenomenon. We have accepted the view that central banks are primarily responsible for maintaining stable prices and nothing else.
Her fitness helped her overcome obstacles that were variations on her worst fears. Though she had no woman to run with, she hooked up with St. Louisan Dan Miner for the first 13 miles, then pulled away. Miner eventually finished in 3:00:00, but Pirtle-Hall kept getting faster, despite a wind that blew at a steady 10 mph and gusted close to 30.

In both countries, there is popular support for a broader establishment of sharia, or Islamic law, developed from the Koran and religious writings. Of course, there is no single sharia; interpretations vary throughout the Middle East and are subject to change. Morocco, for example, sets the legal age of female marriage at 18, based on its more progressive version of sharia, whereas in Saudi Arabia girls as young as 8 are married to much older men, based on its version. As new leaders in the region grapple with how to blend some version of sharia with some version of democracy, women's rights will become a central element of the debate.

Yeah, some cyclists have their issues — especially when it comes to insisting they get all the rights afforded to cars …. without being willing to follow all the rules themselves.

What "Preaching With Sacred Fire" underscores is that though seldom was wider light cast upon it, this oral tradition has flourished for centuries from the pulpit: Men and women who have educated, uplifted and unified their flocks. Here are more than 100 sermons, from both Christian and Muslim traditions, that speak to the pressing issues — slavery, segregation, the war on drugs — of their day. It is a sonorous continuum of voices, prophetic and poetic: John Chavis, the country's first ordained African American Presbyterian preacher; Douglass; Martin Luther King Jr.; Malcolm X; C.L. Franklin; Peter Gomes; Jesse Jackson; Louis Farrakhan; T.D. Jakes and Renita Weems weave a narrative of struggle, resistance and resilience. As Weems tells her flock in her 2004 sermon "Not … Yet": "Right now, this race is not about me and you. It's about generations who are coming after us. It's about little girls and boys in our churches. It's about the little one with the little nappy hair whose mama is on drugs and whose daddy is in jail."
Shanks, who has been involved with the waterfront development issue for the past two decades, said he's not sure when that 70 percent figure first came about as a goal. In the late 1970s or early 1980s, the action arm of the Coastal Commission funded a study to determine what residents wanted. Following months of meetings, the residents said they wanted six acres for a park and three acres for a development, he said.

And then there is contraception. Romney's stance on the new mandate for insurance coverage is well-known, as is his vow to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood. What I'd like to hear from him is why, in an economic proposal that is otherwise sketchy on budgetary details, he specifically endorses eliminating the federal family-planning program, which serves low- and middle-income women. Does Romney want to end contraceptive coverage as part of the Medicaid program as well?

Eighth-grade spelling:
But as we all know, the politicians in Washington do not have to follow the same rules and laws that they make for the rest of us. So they continue to spend all of the Social Security contributions that they take in. And unlike Ponzi investors, American workers do not have the choice of declining to participate in the venture even if they have some doubts about the viability of the investment.
Both the men's and women's victories were impressive, but for different reasons.
Those records apparently were never considered by PG&E officials who reviewed the pipeline's repair history to determine what kind of inspection was needed to ensure the line's safety and satisfy federal law. PG&E also had not noted the repair in the electronic database that tracks vital information about its pipelines.
We make a lot of our products in China but, because of our approach to manufacturing, we can maintain very good quality control. When we find a factory we want to work with, we commit to buying all of their product for the next five years—but only if they meet our standards. Then we send in our own team of trained craftsmen to teach the factory how we like things done. The team stays until they get it right.
During the warmth of March, a lot of waterfowl whipped through Point Pelee quickly, hanging around for less time than usual. But so far the count of colorful warblers and other songbirds has been about normal.

In mid-October, Lilly Valgerdur Oddsdottir discovered that Jeanne and Benson Allen, who had adopted the war bride's children, had divorced in the early 1960s, and Benson had remarried. Lilly Valgerdur, researching the disappearance from her home in Iceland, also found a 2008 obituary in The Oregonian for Jeanne Allen. Melissa read it and felt sick.
Greely, 56, who directs both the law school's Center for Law and the Biosciences and the neuroethics program at the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics, has led the charge to make sure advances in neuroscientific research are applied cautiously to the legal realm.
Higher oil prices have also pushed up airfares around the world, and food prices could rise as costs increase for fertilizers and fuel to run farm equipment and to transport produce, Moody's said. Automakers in Japan and elsewhere could see sales lag because of higher fuel prices.
Tebow said it's exciting to have all of the hype surrounding Sunday's game and believes the team will leave everything on the field. That's easy to believe if you have ever watched him play at the collegiate level or as a professional. Though Tebow has lost back-to-back games against New England and Buffalo since willing his team back into the playoff mix with wins in seven of his first eight starts after replacing Orton, he is not known as one to succumb to pressure (see two National Championships and a Heisman Trophy at Florida).

Epping has just endured a divorce and is teaching adult English to a GED class to pick up a few extra bucks. One of the essays he reads, written by no less than the high school janitor, moves him to tears. And as Jake tells us many times throughout the book, he is not a crying man.
Most of the state's major unions, including the statewide teacher union, have backed Falk, the former county executive from the liberal capital city of Madison. Traditional Democratic backers including the Sierra Club, immigrants' rights groups Voces de la Frontera and the Young Progressives of Wisconsin have also campaigned extensively for her. She has promised to veto any state budget that didn't restore public workers' bargaining rights.
"Grocery stores always adjust to what the consumer wants, whether it's beer or cheese or deli meats," says Brian Dix, who oversees the beer division of distributor Major Brands. "The past two or three years, the consumer has found a taste for craft beer, so that's been gaining more shelf space."
Isom, who was 41 when chosen to be chief here in 2008, said, "I am not seeking out any position, but there has been interest expressed in me, unsolicited." He added, "I certainly have listened to what they have to say, but that's as far as it has gone at this time."

Rucklick's racial sensitivity was always ahead of its time. Perhaps it was osmosis: An orphan by age 11, Ruklick grew up in Princeton, Ill. — one of the stops on the Underground Railroad. But what does a 6-9 man do at age 24? He was a teacher, an investment counselor, and he administered scholarship programs. Along the way, he earned a master's degree in literature, and then a journalism degree from Northwestern at age 51.

Some wanted to resurrect the Veterans Memorial Bridge, the original name of what's now the Dr. Martin Luther King span. Some liked a long-ago suggestion from an old boss of mine who favored U.S. Grant, both for the president who lived here and for the funding source. One wanted to honor Gen. Omar Bradley, "the soldier's general" (who's from Moberly, Mo.).
Westview, which had won six in a row, did not match Beaverton's intensity. The 6-foot-1 Nared, who entered averaging 18.7 points, made 6 of 25 shots and finished with 19 points. Junior guard Delanie Parry (14.0 points per game) struggled to get into the flow, taking two shots and failing to score.

"I always thought of him as a good baseball coach who was really passionate about the game," said Justin Herner, 26, who played for St. Rose in 1999.
So is it unethical to visit the long-necked women? It is clearly true that money spent to visit them supports an artificial village from which they essentially cannot leave. On the other hand, many of them appeared to prefer living in virtual confinement rather than a repressive country plagued by abject poverty and hunger.
Hitchcock mixed up the lines in the second period, putting Jaden Schwartz back with Patrik Berglund, and that seemed to help, but Hitchcock also credited Backes among others for the turnaround.

Two years ago this week, audiences packed St. Mary's Cathedral for something Portland hadn't heard for almost two decades: Beethoven's massive "Missa Solemnis," one of the noblest choral works in the world. Anticipation buzzed through the cathedral as scores of singers and instrumentalists faced the crowd. A young man, so caught up in the moment, even stopped texting on his phone.
“I saw it was a slow hit ball,” Warren said. “I knew I was going to be at third pretty early…once I saw (the ball) skip away (from the first baseman) I just went for it.”

The NHL's finest continued to dominate the scene as the period came to an end. With 4:38 remaining, Perron was horse-collared by an Edmonton defender and referee Dan O'Rourke's arm went up immediately - to penalize Perron for a high stick. The gobs of man-advantage minutes helped the Oilers to a whopping 21 shots in the second.

Brady: I know we have a commission form of government and that's how it operates. Some mayors have been stronger than others in setting unified city policy ahead of time and then making budgetary decisions. That's the type of mayor I'll be. While things are fragmented from an organizational perspective, it doesn't have to be from a priority perspective. So we will set citywide priorities, and arts will be part of that. And then we'll build budgets up based on priorities. I'm frankly tired of the bureau driven mentality that drives horse trading to protect bureau projects. We need to have more citywide vision and set of priorities.
“Sick leave is to be used when you are sick,” the governor said then, “not as a supplemental retirement fund.” We agree, not only out of concern for the immediate costs but also because paying for unused sick leave encourages employees to work when they’re ill.
A pair of malfunctioning streetlights makes it easy to overlook the backpack brigade trekking across the busy intersection, reports the Road Rant scout. The bulbs typically click on early in the evening and then -- bzzzt! -- clock out for the rest of the overnight shift. That puts the kids in a dangerous situation, Kubicina said.
Before the game, before he threw the first pitch, Grisham, unrecognized by the crowd filing in, sat in his seat and watched batting practice, his cap pulled low, a few strands of sandy colored hair poking out of his hat. He didn't turn and talk to me. He stared straight ahead, paying close attention to swings, throw, bunts.

From the Guardian's (U.K.) website: Presenting something deeply weird as entirely straightforward may be the whole point of Blunderbuss.' Leaving aside the lyrics, the most striking thing is the way White uses his melodic skills to mask some off-the-wall musical ideas . The listener is treated to structures so wildly episodic that the closing Take Me With You When You Go' sounds like three different songs  including a 70s stadium-rock anthem and a piece of library music  lashed together.
Actually, Maureen "Moe" Tucker, former drummer of the Velvet Underground, has done the best job ever of explaining where the tea party stands and why it stands there. She also suggests the breadth and variety of the movement. In an interview this week in St. Louis's Riverfront Times, Ms. Tucker said she'd never been particularly political but grew alarmed by the direction the country was taking. In the summer of 2009, she went to a tea-party rally in southern Georgia. A chance man-on-the-street interview became a YouTube sensation. No one on the left could believe this intelligent rally-goer was the former drummer of the 1960s breakthrough band; no one on the left understood that an artist could be a tea partier. Because that's so not cool, and the Velvet Underground was cool.

In February, China agreed to allow more foreign films within its borders. It will permit 34 films annually instead of 20, provided the additional films use either large-screen IMAX or 3-D technologies. The country also will let U.S. studios keep roughly 25% of the box-office revenue from China viewing. Currently, U.S. studios get between 13.5% and 17.5%. (The limits don't apply to films co-produced with a Chinese company.)

The loquacious London, born in the Sonoma County town of Graton, routinely bicycles 60 miles before work and enjoys his weekly hamburger.

Mr. Walker's reforms were a modest but necessary response to the state's fiscal problems, and the proof is in the emerging results. The union reaction was so ferocious because the reforms reduced Big Labor's clout over state and local taxpayers and thus its ability to milk taxpayers year after year without challenge.
There is a flicker in one of the after-the-wreck moments with Paige and Leo working their way through a box of chocolates, trying to recapture the emotions of their first date. If only the filmmakers had found a way to fan that flame.

In what is probably our first true upset of the tournament, Worrell ousted Pete Alexander in the play-in game. Worrell received 59 percent of the vote to advance to face Musial. There were more than 650 people who voted, and clearly present-day players have an edge. That's what will make this tourney interesting, as you'll see in some of the pairings below, all of which were sorted simply by their Wins Above Replacement player. There was no massaging, no finagling, no funny-business in the seeding -- just straight numbers. And still there are many great and intriguing matchups, like the Nos. 8/9 clash below and even a No. 12 that could upset a No. 5. Promise. All Old Pete Alexander did was mark a Hall of Fame career with some of the most important outs in Cardinals history -- the outs that won the team's first World Series title. That wasn't enough to knock out Worrell, and it's unlikely that Worrell will pull another upset of a Hall of Famer here.
“Live, we usually do add the bass player,” he adds. “So we call ourselves a duo but live we do this power trio thing.

Allen has expressed an interest in hiring an experienced general manager. At this rate, he may have found that experience in Buchanan, who is preparing for his second draft and third free agency period as the main guy. I know few, if any, in the Blazers' offices would complain. Buchanan is very well-liked, has no ego and carries an unflappable demeanor. I disagree with his decision to trade Andre Miller and Rudy Fernandez for Felton, and I question in last year's draft whether Kenneth Faried wouldn't have been a better pick at No.21 than Nolan Smith. But he has created financial flexibility for the team to operate this summer.
A deputy since 2008, Lawrence, 32, is on paid leave, pending the investigation, said sheriff's spokesman John O'Brien. O'Brien confirmed Lawrence took a sick day Aug. 29. Last year, he made $45,000 with the department.

Unlike California or Arizona, Oregon has little in the way of "utility-scale solar." A big project here is 2 megawatts, where some of the massive panel arrays being assembled in the desert Southwest are 50 megawatts or more.

In the concerto's second movement, it was triple pianissimo pizzicati that brought attention to an often glossed-over corner of the concerto; in the Adès overture, it was a swaggering, brassy introduction that ignited the music; and in Smetana, especially in the second movement ("The Moldau"), it was a powerful, dynamic, full-bodied sound far removed from all those George Szell Mozart recordings that made Cleveland famous.

The Ravens locker room, even on the quietest of days, is a churning, bubbling storm of music and voices. Most of the time, it feels as chaotic as a busy train station, as crowded and lively as a food market. A high-stakes game of bean bag toss in the middle of the room fuels perpetual shouting and arguing. Terrell Suggs' frequently leaves movies blaring on the Blu-ray player set up in his locker, but he ignores the dialogue to rib his teammates, or the media, with his booming voice. Terrence Cody has music thumping from his iPod speakers so frequently, his teammates dubbed the area surrounding his locker as "Patterson Park," and Cody responded by writing those words on a piece of athletic tape, then slapping it on the wall above his locker.
"So, I got to work," he said. "For the past two weeks, I've been out here every day."

Ohio has one of the longest statutes for allowing suits, including debt collection suits, over written contracts. Eight years is still longer than many other states, but it at least gets Ohio closer to the norm. SB 224 is expected to pass today's floor vote and then head to the House for hearings.

Chris Stewart has been demoted to the fourth line and is expected to play with Chris Porter and Scott Nichol tonight.
We were in a strange position among Americans. Before we left, we frequently had to explain where Dubrovnik is on the map. While we were en route, however, experienced backpackers kept telling us that Croatia was too crowded, old news, and, worst of all, touristy. We were straddling the line between the tame and the exotic; it was Frommers versus Lonely Planet. It was exactly where we wanted to be.
On Friday, strong wind gusts added to the unseasonable chilly temperatures. A slight drizzle, the first rainfall in the festival's history, had attendees huddling for warmth and running for cover. "We put up our teepee in the campground and it blew over," said Sam Macucci, 24, of Los Angeles.
