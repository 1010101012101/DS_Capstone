If you haven't heard of Philip K. Dick, you're at least familiar with his work. He produced a huge corpus of visionary fiction before his death in 1982, including stories that became the basis for the films "Blade Runner," "Minority Report" and "Total Recall."The Dick estate, which is managed by Coelho, 51, and her half-sister Isa Dick Hackett, 44, optioned the film rights to "Adjustment Team" to writer/director George Nolfi in 2001 for $25,000. Nolfi, who subsequently wrote the screenplay and directed the retitled film version, had transferred the rights to Media Rights Capital, an independent studio. The producers exercised the option by paying the estate $1.4 million, with at least $500,000 more due once the film achieved its break-even point.

The increasingly interdependent world economy brings a new framework for business leaders to consider the question: How do I foster decisive leadership to achieve a high level of success? While classical in nature, it is now necessary to examine this question through lenses that focus on appreciation of international interdependencies and cultural differences. To do this, the international business leader must develop a globally focused education, master multilingual capabilities and embrace cultural differences.

So here is my stab at an overview of the section. It’s not perfect at all – but helps (I hope) to illustrate the see-saw between the now and not yet.
His relations were very happy to see him, Ngarande and Charakupa were still alive, but his mother and Chidyausiku were already dead. On his return journey to Chishawasha he was given by Ngarande some children to accompany him. When he reached Chishawasha the people welcomed him with much happiness. After this, those people who had accompanied Chinamora from Mahugwi returned to their own country after seeing Chishawasha. When Derere came from Mahugwi he was very old, then he became sick and died. He was buried on a certain place now called Caledon near Ruwa.

I grew up near the water, sailed a small wooden craft with my brother many a time across the choppy lake of our holidays, water-skied for years, trained and swam in school carnivals as was expected of a Sydney girl, and even now swim laps at the pool because I can't do without it. And yet the water - a grey mass of sea water in the night - still scares me.

I thought I looked pretty good. I had my blonde hair flipped back on the sides, ala Farrah Fawcett, skinny jeans with high heels and I was ready to dance. My roommate, Pat, sat beside me. Pat couldn’t care less if a guy asked her to dance or not. She just went with the flow. She had these gorgeous blue eyes and short dark hair. She was tall and thin and smoked like a fiend. She had this way of inhaling a cigarette that made me want to mock her. The more she quietly drank, the more her hair fell into her eyes. She was a lot of fun to be with. Years later she was a bridesmaid in my wedding.

The Church of Scientology is on a very self-destructive path, as is becoming more and more evident. Its addiction to power and money has perverted the Church to the point where it is unrecognizable to old timers. Instead of being encouraged to get up the Bridge, help others, or get involved in community activities, Scientologists are pressured to give more and more money to things like the IAS, the Superpower Building, and “Ideal” Orgs. These days, it’s all about money and buildings.
There's no way, at this rate, that Rosie is not now proved to be the fine and exciting writer I have always known her to be, yet in the 'How I Did It' section she describes the struggles she has encountered in a commercialised publishing industry. Such struggles are all too common now for literary writers who are however hardly free to air them before achieving this kind of success, and so the difficulties lie hidden. Mslexia, however, hearing 'rumours from agents that the market for fiction was in freefall, publishing deals were harder to come by, advances were decimated, and established authors were being tossed on the scrap heap' and noting that 'it's a sad fact that many agencies employ junior staff to sift submissions' and that in such a situation success depends on contacts, launched their competition to test how much good debut literary fiction has been left lying by the wayside. Their results appear to be spectacular: they say they were 'seriously impressed by the standard of the writing on show'. To find out why so much good writing was lying hidden they contacted the hundred (!) longlisted authors. It wasn't that the writers weren't sending their stuff out; far from it, but only 15% had managed to get an agent. Amongst the rest Mslexia encountered a tale of 'near misses', agents recognising the merit of manuscripts, even working for long periods with the authors on manuscripts, but ultimately feeling unable to sell them. Rosie herself writes of an agent who sent her winning book out only once, leaving it languishing after a single rejection before finally confessing to her that 'the market was so dire at the moment, he had been told by the agency to concentrate on non-fiction.'

Fortunately, the film manages to be pretty great despite the (unintentional) weirdness at its core. Pickford plays Gwendolyn, the rich girl victim of parental neglect and mean servants, trapped in her fancy house and not allowed to play with other (poorer) children or go outside or have any fun at all. The first half of the film details a few episodes where Gwen breaks down the strict social order that's been imposed upon her, and Pickford here is a wonderful physical comedienne playing that slapstick standard agent of chaos: getting in a mudfight with neighborhood boys who've snuck into her garden, getting back at a mean rich girl by tricking her into sitting on a sandwich and most glorious of all, utterly destroying her bathroom, dancing like a madwoman and dousing her maid with malfunctioning plumbing.
When I entered this course, I was worried that I was way behind my peers. It was a big surprise when I realized that most of what my creative writing teachers lectured about was something I already learned in debate. Turns out, I had been practicing the tenets of art without realizing it. All I had to do now was to figure out how to apply these debate techniques to my art.

Most of the military build-up is concentrated against Abkhazia and South Ossetia. A modern, NATO-compatible barracks has just been built in Senaki in western Georgia not far from Abkhazia, and another one is under construction near Gori, a half-hour driving distance from Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia. According to the report, each of these bases will have the capacity to house a brigade, with a troop-strength of 3,000.
Depictions of the land garner our attention in numerous ways and means. Perhaps its most compelling role and representation is it as the space in which we act out all of our stories. In desiring to understand and shape the land, we might hope that our own stories will be more controlled. Land is the place that provides sustenance for us both literally as well as metaphorically. There exists an attachment to the land for its ability to mark time: it can be a glimpse into the past, while offering a promise of the future; yet, in many ways the land, despite its mutability, seems constant. Interest also exists in the idea of the land as it relates to the accessibility to the viewer, and thus intrinsically one may believe that the land is free for all to envision. Regardless, the land is ultimately intriguing simply because we know that we are both separate from it, and it exists for it’s own sake.
Nietzsche and I first met in September 2010 in one of the RC passages, especially about literary renaissance. Technically he was little related to rebirth I mentioned above. Hence I should take this opportunity to thanks Wikipedia. Wiki was/is/will always be the vessel of digression. I must say, every detour I took on Wikipedia reveals new facet. At that time it was better to engulf into literary articles than Jenifer Aniston’s affairs. Do not underestimate my words as well as power of Wikipedia. There is no link between Nietzsche and Jennifer but you may end up on both the pages within few minutes.

But who will be cooking the food, selling the goods, fighting the combats and reading the poetry, you ask. Re-enactors! In the world today there is a huge number of people who dress up as people from the past. These are men, women and children who leave their ordinary lives behind for a weekend or two per year to dress up in ancient garb and become someone else. Archeon theme park invites various re-enactment groups from all over Europe to come. They get room and board, but pay for their own travel and give their time for free. Each of them is an expert in their own field. As an historical author, I rely heavily on input from living history actors, as they like to call themselves. Some people think re-enactors should "get a life". I think re-enactors have at least two lives: their day-to-day life and their ancient alter-ego! I recently posted a POLL on my Facebook page, asking re-enactors why they gave up precious time to dress up and "inhabit" the past. The top three answers were 1. To learn more about their period, 2. To inspire children to study history, 3. To share their knowledge with others. All most commendable. It's great to stop and see how a mosaic-maker does it. Or watch a fresco-painter at work. Or ask a runaway slave what is branded on her forehead!

Didn’t Young Gul tell her? He handed it, and her, over for the five million. She’s stunned. He asks her where she’s living these days and if there’s anything else she wants to know. She’s got nothing more to say and heads out. As she’s leaving, he asks her with a smile if she can become the Fashion King? Hehe, you totally made that proposal for her! She nods but her mind is elsewhere and as she walks out, she’s troubled by what Jae Hyuk has told her.

The large cast of secondary characters worked for the most part and I found myself really liking a lot of them. The ghost of Jackson's twin sister Courtney added depth to his character, the strained relationship with his father definitely added the action, Holly was good motivation and Adam was a great sidekick. I liked that I felt the depth of Jackson's and Holly's relationship early on and as Jackson explored his feelings for her, the relationship became even more alive. It's easy to see why these characters liked each other and helped me to stay engaged and believe in their relationship. I did tend to get confused with so many other characters in the CIA and EOT divisions, sometimes to the point where I'd just shrug my shoulders and keep reading, hoping a name would straighten itself out. It was good to have that many characters in some ways because it did keep me guessing but I felt I lost a little bit of the effect since I couldn't keep them all straight.

For me, novels are such big projects that there are many different finish lines. The one I crossed today is an important one. Now I have a structure and story in place. The bones of the book are all there. I've done most of the important research, though there's still lots more to fill in (but now I'll have a better sense of what I'm missing). But my first drafts are rough--practically unreadable, I'm sure, to anyone but me. Now it's all about clarifying the characters and working on the language. I write a book like a painter might make a painting, first with thin pencil lines, and then gradually adding more and more layers of color, until the whole image finally comes together. I've still got a long way to go.

I think it is clear that this story is not mean to be set in the Sixties. The computer technology is more advanced and there seems to be peace with Russia.

This is clear evidence that the UNIT stories have an 80s rather than a 70s setting.

Throughout the novel I included chapters from the perspectives of secondary characters because I felt that they provided a wider scope for the unusual situation in North Korea, as well as to give texture to the sex trade underworld. The story of my main characters is a direct result of the scheming and justifications of the secondary characters, and their fates are intertwined. Even though it is a novel with main characters who we hope to see triumph over hardship, it is not a novel about those characters. All Woman and Springtime is about crossing boundaries of all kinds, about universal humanity that transcends borders and cultures, about taking charge of one’s own destiny. One probably would not glean these things from page 69.Learn more about the book and author at Brandon W. Jones's website.

When I tried to explain to her that she doesn’t need it- any of it, the makeup, the diet, the skanky clothing- to be a worthwhile person, she gave me a look that broke my heart. She genuinely could not comprehend what I was saying. The music she listens to, the clothes she wears, and the attention of the boys at her school are what make her her. I can’t help feeling that I somehow failed as a sister, so see her like that. I mean, by all means, if you want to wear playboy and an inch of foundation because that’s what you want to do, do so! Just please, dear gods, don’t do it so other people will see you as worthy.

Byrne utilises the Beveridge Report to focus his attack upon the unemployed, supposed ‘idleness’ whilst ignoring the realities of capitalist relations. For instance, he refers to Beveridge’s support for full employment. Full employment was associated with Keynesian economics. Under the current capitalist system, the idea of full employment is a farce. As many influential thinkers have shown, full employment is impossible in a capitalist system, as we always need some sort of reserve army of labour in order to keep the system ticking over. Whether that be called the lumpen proletariat, NEETS or the underclass, these so-called parasites of the system are actually required to keep the capitalist neoliberal system in the balance.

Ha! Look at Mumma E loving the camera! She wore a scoop neck T-shirt I made her as an experiment just before we went on holiday together to Venice in January. You can't really see it but the print on the jersey is leaves and insects. It was an experiment because it was the first stretchy garment I have made her and without having her close by (Mumma E lives in Essex, holler!) it was a real guess. Being considerably tinier than me, the proportions and dimensions were difficult to judge, but aside from needing to be taken in a bit at the waist, it was an overall success. Plus Venice was FREEZING when we went, so she was thankful for an extra layer of clothing!

One of the ways Jim stays involved in the kids' unschooling is to bring home brainteaser challenges for them every once in while. We've had a relatively typical, I guess, back and forth with regards to unschooling, Jim being the consummate skeptic and reluctant practitioner. With time, however, he's really been able to see lots of the learning that goes on naturally and come even to embrace the more relaxed pace our lives.

Once inside, My Friend asked me what the matter was. I promptly asked him who that truck belongs to. He said he didn’t know the man’s name, only that he was very drunk and the man was with someone (Jim) who works on the property that we live on. Jim has permission to use the boat on the lake that is essentially in our front yard and, so, Jim and this man were out fishing. I immediately started with the questions: Does the man have a scraggly beard? Is he really skinny? Is he wearing a baseball cap? A t-shirt with a front pocket? Yep, yep, yep and yep. And has teeth are a bit funky. That’s it. The baby blue with a trowel in the back was a dead giveaway. I knew it, though I didn’t want to know it. Right there before my eyes, fishing in my front yard was the Boy Left Behind’s uncle.

Chocolate is my comfort, my friend, my lover. But I am on this diet and one of the things I can’t have is chocolate. I could have cocoa powder, but part of the diet is the idea of rethinking the way you think about food. So if I go buy cocoa powder and put it in almond butter, yes, I have a chocolate substitute that is allowable, but I am still using food/chocolate for comfort.

It was 11pm when we left the city to travel down south of luzon. It was one of the longest travel I have experienced. It took us more than 10 hours to reach our destination. But it’s all worth it when we finally saw the crystal blue green water and the powdery white sand of calaguas. It was a long stretch of powdery white sand and the greens that served as a backdrop of this magnificent place.

The first, and probably key tip is to use a tripod. It will not be possible to capture fork lightning without a tripod because everything will blur. Generally, the slower the shutter speed you can use the better, because the longer the shutter is open, the more chance you have of capturing that split second in an image, but without the tripod you will not be able to avoid camera shake.

I collapsed on the bed and stroked her breasts in blissful post orgasmic euphoria as she caressed my cock and balls. I remember feeling incredibly close to her that day as she held my balls in her hand. It would take my first tryst with (my now) wife 6 years after that to feel the same about any girl in a sexual way.
I'm ready to get the ball rolling. I'm ready to go back in for my post-op appointment on Thursday with Dr. Friedrich. I'm ready to hear who she is referring me to since I am now "high-risk" (i have very mixed emotions about this new title). I'm ready to see this new doctor and get answers. I'm ready for the results to come back on our baby to know if this was something random and genetic error and nothing more than a fluke and bad luck or if maybe there is something wrong that can be fixed. I'm just ready to not feel stuck like I do now.

It's just a matter of time before the delicate balance of nature explodes into chaos-and doom.

We have little possums running around our house. At first we thought it was one that had gotten in from a little spot that hadn't quite been closed up yet. I caught it and let it go outside the house and the next day, there it is again. So, I did that three times; the third time was at 4 am, then that afternoon there was a baby possum in the house. I've caught two and used a carrier to drive them miles away from the house to let them go but we still have at least one little one in the house that I'm trying to catch. They are sneaky little things and quick to hide. I catch them with my hands, which isn't always easy and the real trick is... patience.

What these 3 people have in common is that they are all Reagan Republicans, people who either worked for the Reagan presidency or who’s views were forged and sculpted in the early 80s.

She's inquisitive, smart, funny, busy, opinionated, energetic, sweet, loud, fantastic, and fun to be around. I said to Brent the other day that as much as I love when our kids are babies, this stage that Amarys is at is when it really starts getting fun. The learning is so remarkable, and how they absorb new things and reproduce them, and start interacting at more complex levels, and it is just so fun. When they run around and have opinions and their eyes are wide open with wonder at everything from the way eggs crack to the taste of shoe tread, it brings everyone joy. When they start knowing that after bathtime, we brush teeth and read books, so they bang their toothbrush on the sink and then run and get a story and back into your lap to listen, it is just so cool. They are born these warm, puking, wiggly little kangaroo babies with no experience of the world except what is done to them, and in one year they are suddenly acting upon the world in order to make it do things for them, and they love with wild abandon, and it is just so beautiful.

I was up at five—the boys begin to sing from Magdalen Tower at six, and I can’t become fully conscious in less than an hour. The others were soon up too, and we set off down the road with Darcy’s three-person black umbrella and the Duchess’s little pink polka-dotted one. Itchy Feet played at Junction last night, which accounted for the unusually large (all things considered) quantity of skankily clad girls hobbling along the pavement. Some of them were heading away from Magdalen bridge, having clearly been a bit too enthusiastic over the course of the preceding night, and looking as though they were in dire need of a large glass of water and a pillow. One girl in a sapphire-blue dress and wobbling heels, supported by a stout lad on either side, was being more or less hauled down the middle of the street, head sunk on chest, blonde hair straggling in the early morning drizzle. It shouldn’t have been funny, but it was a bit—she was clearly with friends and taken care of, and as for the other stumbling drunks, they looked like remnants of a zombie invasion, minus the exposed internal organs. The bridge, which was closed to vehicles but open to foot traffic (obviously) was already packed by the time we arrived, but gaps in the crowd opened up as more casualties of the late night/early morning broke cover and headed for home. They threaded their way through the crowd, getting progressively more dampened due to their lack of umbrellas: boys in tight t-shirts with ironic hair (now being ruined by the unrepentant weather), a whole line of girls who had evidently decided to improvise rainproof jackets from translucent bin liners.

Allan Shivers died in 1985 and his widow in 1996, leaving “Woodlawn” to the University of Texas. UT thought the house a white elephant and sold it to the State. Reportedly, one of the things former Lieutenant Governor Bob Bullock asked Governor George W. Bush before his death in 1999 was that “Woodlawn” be made the new Governor’s Mansion, but Bush didn’t like the idea. After several years of red tape and general run-around, the house was purchased by Austin investor Jeff Sandefer, who removed the additions Shivers had made, and spent several million dollars restoring the place for his own family.

A common problem I see writers online facing seems to be getting themselves out of a non-writing funk.

For some reason I thought Sweet Pea would just cry a little bit but not have too hard of a time. The reality, unfortunately, was that she COMPLETELY freaked on me and I had to fight her to get her shirt off with the help of the nurse, and then hold her screaming, thrashing body while the nurse quickly gave her all the shots. Sweet Pea SCREAMED and fought and SCREAMED and shouted at the nurse, "STOP THAT!" It really, really sucked, especially since her being so tense and screaming, etc. caused her more pain with these shots than she would have otherwise had. One of the injection sites was bleeding a lot after the shot and had a bruise within two minutes of getting the shot. That's the one that's hurting her the most.

So why was Mr. Ingram killed, and by whom? Despite his past substance abuse, this was not a drug-related crime, nor was it a crime of passion, a gang initiation, or vigilante justice. According to eyewitness testimony, Mr. Ingram passed the evening of September 28, 2007 collecting cans and puttering around the Albany Houses. Meanwhile, a group of teenagers and young adults gathered at a party in one of the housing project's six 16-story towers, where they partied, as partygoers do, with a little booze and a little weed. One attendee was dancing with a girl, who turned out to have a boyfriend, who in turn had a problem with the first guy dancing with his girlfriend and decked him. A scuffle ensued, and the unwelcome dancer left the party in a rage, accompanied by a good friend. When the two got clear of the party, they came across Steven Ingram, and the angry teenager took a swing at him, hard enough to miss and fall down. Ingram turned and ran, but his assailant chased him down, hit him again, knocked him to the ground, and continued swinging. His friend tried to pull him clear, failed, and ran to get help.

For me, the most compelling aspect of In Winter’s Shadow was the character of Gwynhwyfar, who narrates the novel in first person throughout. Gwynhwyfar as portrayed here is a fully three-dimensional character, with her share of human failings and her share of admirable qualities. She is intelligent and well educated, and sufficiently interested in the past to understand and share Arthur’s dream of recreating the best aspects of the lost Roman Empire, including impartial justice and respect for law. While Arthur is fighting battles, Gwynhwyfar is managing logistics and supply with a quiet fortitude that brings out the best in people and gets things done. Supply may be less than glamorous, but it is as essential as dashing tactics; as the old (apocryphal?) military saw has it, ‘Amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics’. Arthur relies on her as much as on any of his warriors, and working together as partners in a shared task allows them to develop a deep and loving marriage. But the relentless immensity of the task inevitably puts a strain on their relationship, intensified by Medraut’s sly scheming.

H.R. 4970 will roll back years of progress and bi-partisan commitment on the part of Congress to protect victims of violence. This bill will completely undercut the U visa program and VAWA self-petitioning by eliminating VAWA confidentiality, denying U visa recipients the ability to adjust their status, creating barriers to protection that will deter victims from cooperating with law enforcement, and holding victims of abuse to a higher standard than other applicants for immigration benefits. In short, H.R. 4970 denies victims the very protections created VAWA and even helps perpetrate the abuse from which they are seeking to escape. Tell your Representative to stand up for immigrant victims of violence by saying NO to these bad provisions.

2) We have lost control over our basic information. I'm sure that my name, address, dob, favorite foods, etc. are floating out on the Web somewhere. More importantly, I didn't put (some of) them on the Web, nor did I request that it be done. Nevertheless, it is out there somewhere on the Web for everyone to see. More importantly, I am not alone; most of us are probably in the same boat. Whether we care about it or not (I personally am not overly worried about it), we have lost control of our information. We do not necessarily determine what people see and when they see it. The growth of the Internet and social media have set us free in many ways; however, it does come with a cost--some loss of privacy and personal control of information.

What is it? It's the Munchkin Easy Squeeze Spoon and I got it at Target. Basically, you load it up with baby food or baby cereal, twist on the spoon, and go...ANYWHERE! The spoon twists to an "open" or "closed" position, so it is self containing. You squeeze the bottle part and it squirts the food onto the spoon. You don't have to worry about the baby grabbing the bowl and throwing the food everywhere because it is all contained in the bottle!

So between helping out with the excitement Wesley's arrival created in his house, and in order to attend the birth and blessing of another grandchild--sweet baby Chase--in Utah, plus the added needs of my mom, something had to give this spring, and that something was the LDStorymakres' writing conference in Provo. Despite my many blessings, and my extreme joy, I do confess to a bit of withdrawal pain. I love this conference, and I am mentioning it here because anyone who loves to write and who wants to improve their writing, should consider going next year.

Visit often and read all the successes this LDS writing group is having in their efforts to flood the earth with high-quality but clean reads. To my friends attending conference this week. I miss you, and I hope you have a blast.
Bottom 2 – Alisha & Kyle
So the second day of Brussels, after a terrible day, I decided to bail out of the group’s dinner plans and eat by myself.
Just a little post to recap my feelings about the previous year: no time is ever wasted. No experiences are ever wasted if you learn and grow from it. A year is just an increment in time to mark off accomplishments and events.
I've coloured the image with promarkers & flexmarkers adding some snow writer to the frosting on the cupcake.

~Twenty-ish year old girls annoy the crap out of me when they're in groups of 3 or more. Seriously, can't they find a way to laugh without sounding like nails on a chalkboard?
Don't get me wrong. Working at Cartoon Network was fantastic. I will cherish my years there as the Art Director of the Games Studio. My team was second to none and worked amazingly well together. I was given so many opportunities and was able to work on many great projects. I made many lifelong friends. I learned more than I ever thought that I could. My family and I enjoyed our time in the Atlanta area.
Meanwhile, this bicycle seeking adventure continues. In my heart I have narrowed it down the this humble Santa Cruz Aluminum Highball, which is a fine ride for the money.
I have heard of a couple of these. The rest I'll do some research on and look at online sources. Mountain Rose Herbs has several sea vegetables available.
One of the things that is most difficult in discussing class issues when on, if not the winning side of class warfare, at least appreciably far from the losing side, is how to balance the obvious need to not just respect the working class but substantively honor and depict working class narratives with the fact that the vicissitudes of class conflict in the modern world have systematically deprived much of the working class of the education and breadth of experience necessary to avoid a wealth of bigotries. In the United States this is an aggressively pressing problem. Simply put, much of the Republican base are the people most hurt by Republican policies, but the Republican policies that hurt them make it harder to effectively communicate this problem to them. And nobody likes the rich liberal who tries to “explain things” to the working class, and understandably so because that’s horrifically egotistical.
'Well, to tell you the truth,' says the Pope, 'they never let me drive at the Vatican and I'd really like to drive today.'
Basically, this hands on idea is just average tie-dying but I think it’s a bit cooler. All you gotta do is gather some paper towels, your favorite set of thick paints, vinegar, and rubber bands. This activity is a lot better if you do it outside, preferably when its sunny and you can crank up some tunes.
either way pray for healthy embryos please. I'm not sure how well I'd handle it if we don't at least get a few good ones.

We've become a wee bit obsessed with camping...In the Rooster that is. No, we didn't already step up to that amazing Airstream, but you can see the Rooster and Butterball in the reflection. Oh to dream!

Where to begin? With the Web handle of the Kossack who saved me a trip to the attic. Two years ago, I wrote two well-researched pieces about minority crime, entitled “Enough with the Obfuscation.” The first, about black crime, was subtitled Blinded, On Purpose. The second, about “Hispanic” crime, was subtitled, Autoasphyxiation, not Strangling. In the latter, I wrote this:
We obviously have a soft spot for the bloom, since it is in our name. Lavender is such a romantic and timeless flower and it just seemed natural to pair it with the city of romance - Paris. We envisioned a fall wedding with rustic elements like twine and weathered vintage keys in the decor. The bride would wear a lace gown with classic pearl jewelry and a vintage brooch would be pinned on her fragrant lavender bouquet. Lavender-colored accents in the china place settings, the cake, and the French macarons would tie into the theme.
It may seem concerning from a rule of law perspective that both Messers A and V are very well known to all branches of law enforcement and are on good terms with them. That is not as unusual as we may like to think and is not exclusively a “Ukrainian thing”. Many a career criminal in the UK was/is on cordial terms with “the law”. Familiarity when it comes to who you meet regularly in your profession and all that. Such things are never always black and white until circumstances force them to be so, particularly as you climb the tree on either side of the line.
Even greater for crashing me into fate.

In 1981 he was arrested in Botswana smuggling weapons and diamonds. In 1985 he was selling an ANC/SWAPO weapons cache near Saurimo in Angola to UNITA . At the time UNITA was an ally of the Apartheid government and a sworn enemy of the ANC. At one stage in Lusaka he shared a house with a cocaine, ecstasy and other drugs dealer known as Mr. Stevens.
The other part that sucks is that I have lost count of how long it has been since I had a serious meltdown. I was beginning to enjoy that feeling of control.
A cardiac intensivist just emerged to tell us that there do not appear to be signs of infection outside of Sam's heart (this is big news--an uncontrolled infection would spell disaster); also, the preliminary tests on the pieces of vegetation that have been removed appear negative so far. She also added that with the large amount of vegetation on Sam's aortic valve, she feels more confident that they made the right decision in undertaking this surgery.

I enjoy writing about writing—and talking about it. Perhaps that’s why I enjoy writer’s conferences. They’re a great way to fellowship with other writers.
In India, the lentil is known as dal or daal. For many centuries, lentils were considered to be “the poor man’s meat.” In Catholic countries, those who couldn’t afford fish would eat lentils during Lent instead.
During an interview do not be tempted to complain about previous colleagues. If you left your old job due to a conflict with a former boss, even if this was not down to you – Say nothing, instead bite your tongue! This could imply that you have difficulty getting on with people and this will not be the impression you want to leave with a prospective employer.

I've always been jealous of other campers' tapestries and fun colors. In previous years, we had an old, solid gray shower curtain and a poorly tie-dyed sheet which worked great at blocking the sun, but didn't add much to the overall aesthetic of our camp. Last year I bought a small tapestry, but I wanted more this year.
Okay, the dance party is now playing KISS's "God Gave Rock and Roll To You." I'm beginning to get grumpy, so I should probably sign off.
For those who don’t follow boxing, like me, you often wonder how the sport still remains to be relevant in this day and age. With the UFC becoming more popular than ever, boxing has fallen behind a bit in the ratings. But if there’s one guy that can still make the sport as relevant as ever, it’s Floyd Mayweather. Mayweather, who is currently 43-0, is arguably the most controversial boxer in recent memory. Every time Mayweather has a match, people will tune in just to see if his undefeated streak will come to an end. Last night, I was one of them, and I don’t normally watch boxing.

I know that you LOVE running the state of New Jersey but you know that you would have knocked Mitt Romney out of the running. You know legislation like the back of your hand, you are fair and speak up without fear of retaliation from either political party and I love it! By the way, the slack that you took via lowering the flags when singer Whitney Houston died did not sway you from your decision. Although, I did agree with the majority of the people on their initial reasoning of why they did NOT want you to grant the lovely Miss Houston with that honor but I admired the fact that you “heard the people and their opinions” but still stuck with yours to lower the flags. Hey, it is ultimately your decision because it was indeed the people who elected you to run the state of New Jersey.
He chuckled and hiked the towel back up around his waist. “Why are you blushing? It’s just a little pubic hair, and it’s not like we’re not wearing the same equipment.”

In 2 short months, we will start designing and decorating a "big boy room" for Liam and turning his nursery into the new baby's nursery. So much design and decor in so little time!
The next day the woman came by our house to attempt another assessment. We were in the middle of reading a book (in english.) Khubz introduced everyone (grandma, baby V, Maj and Thumper--all speaking english with a thick iowa accent.) She chatted about nocturnal creatures, whether or not they were primarily carnivorous, what kinds of magic school bus books we've read that explored these ideas. . .
When I got up this morning the temperature was 35 degrees!!! WOW--that's a big difference from the high 80's we had up until yesterday. We only got to the mid to high 60's yesterday.
Noticing how we experience grief involves developing an awareness of the internal and external responses to our losses. External noticing requires that we stop long enough to realize how what’s going on in the outside world is impacting our mind, emotions and physical body. External cues impact what we tell ourselves about our life and our losses. The internal expressions of grief require us to pay attention to the emotions that accompany loss. The key here is that we notice what these feelings are trying to tell us about the condition of our heart.
DW: Could you explain why that is not the case?
Char Dham Mandir has all the deities of the 4 important dhams of the north and an ISKCON style animated puppet tableau display of many important events from Krishna’s life and the puranas. Payal was so delighted with the life size puppets especially when Krishna shook his hand or head. And I realised that what adults might think is childish or even corny is an actual delight to a small child. By this time Payal was learning to trust me a little and honoured me by holding my hand.
So I decided to make this about shopping, particularly since I just walked around a mall for hours with my friend yesterday. Don’t get me wrong, I totally shouldn’t be spending money at all. But thankfully aside from a little spending money, I’ve saved most of what I’ve made since high school. So I haven’t had to ask my mom for money, and I’ve even been able to pay my student loan monthly bill along with internship costs.
Have you seen this flaming bag of bullshit? I received a tweet from an individual agent announcing this craptacularness several weeks ago. I had hoped it had died the sad, pathetic death it needed, but it looks like we're in for it.
We are going to get some hardware for them too, eventually, it is dang expensive! We saw some that were $4.00 and $5.00 EACH, so 15 cabinets and 6 drawers later = .. Expensive. Maybe next month.

I would like to thank you all for your words of sympathy regarding our recent loss. With all these things going on around here, unfortunately I didn’t have the chance to follow you as often as I wanted and also didn’t have the time to post about a tag. My fellow blogger Elisabeth from Food and Thrift Finds tagged me to present a course of 5 to 10 dishes for Easter. Sadly, Easter has passed and to be honest we didn’t do anything in particular, since we were in bereavement. Nevertheless, mother’s day is on its way and regardless, I think we don’t need a special occasion to make something special for our loved ones isn’t it? Thanks again Elizabeth for the tagging!

Not only will you not buckle under adverse circumstances, you will rejoice in them knowing that His grace is sufficient. Because of that trust Paul could write to the Romans in 5:2-3: “We have access by faith into the grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hoe of the glory of God. And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also.”
I'm including a list of her works, but it's confusing since many stories have been packaged as part of a tankoban and matching stories might be in different books.

I love the story about how Allison and I first connected online. Not only is she a New York Times Bestselling author, she is also a very successful freelance magazine writer. She had put out a query for an article she was writing about marriage, something about keeping it fresh, and I answered her questions and she followed up with me and my quotes got in the magazine. At that time, her first book, The Department of Lost and Found, wasn’t out yet, and I didn’t know she was going to be a super-star author.
These days, I live sandwiched between two nests: phoebes in the front, bluebirds in the back. Sometimes, when I'm watching the bluebirds out the back window, if the light is just right the front window is reflected in the back window, and I can see the phoebes silhouetted against the bluebirds as both pairs flit to and from their nests.

When Rover was selling the Rover 2000, the P6, it had an advert showing one alongside a heap of rusted car bodies with the slogan "Thank Goodness in These Days of Mass Production, a Rover is still a Rover". My dad's company car was a Rover 2000. At three years old it had holes through it.

The initial expenditure, according to documents at the city's ACRIS database, consisted of three mortgages totaling $30 million (assuming I'm reading it right): a Building Loan Mortgage, a Mortgage, and the Project Loan Mortgage. Property Shark indicates that the market value of the building is $83.8 million. It also notes that the developer, upon purchasing the building, spent millions to upgrade it. It's not clear to me whether an announced $12.8 million cost on 10/16/90 was an expenditure or an estimate; note that in 1991 two projects, for $3.6 million and $1.25 million, seem to cover some of the same ground.
From the start, I sensed something different was up. I addressed her as Mrs Gardner and she said, ‘I’m not Mrs Gardner. Everyone’s talking about Mrs Gardner, and I don’t know who she is. I’m Margaret. I’m Peggy.’
I will admit that there were self-inflicting factors weighing in. Factors that could have been helped with a little discipline on my behalf. After returning to college in January 2007 to finish my bachelor’s degree, my diet went down the toilet, exercise was placed on the back burner, drinking water was replaced by coffee, and lots of it to pull all-nighters finishing homework. And along with these dark sky study sessions came 24-hours of wearing the same makeup (and sometimes reapplying a new layer on top of the old in the library bathroom). It’s not always easy to squeeze in a PM face cleanse.
The Americans had identified only a handful of drug-tainted accounts at the Lebanese Canadian Bank. The search for further trouble began over the summer, after the Société Générale de Banque au Liban, or S.G.B.L., agreed to buy the bank’s assets.
I bought unfinished wooden cubes at a craft store and wrote on them with a Sharpie (hence the bleeding.) I'm sure someone clever will comment with a better way to make these. You could also just use regular 6-sided dice and provide a decoder (rolling a 1 or 2 means "or", etc), but I was in overachiever mode yesterday.

That is not, in fact, a picture of Sienna Guillory. It's underwear model Alessandra Ambrosio. She isn't even an actress, but is quite literally an underwear model. I think I must have mislabled the photo while searching for suitable subjects for the Tectonic Tuesdays series. (And they don't come much more suitable than Ms. Ambrosio. We'll be seeing more of her in 2011, I'm certain.)

Ever since Mary Jo Kopechne died, I've been afraid of drowning in a car. That fear has stayed with me through the years.
And… this population-growth is not confined to rabid sports fans… by no means; we’re talking cuddling teenagers in the first flush of lust as much as babes in the arms of great-grandparents… and absolutely everyone one can think of in-between. Entire families dressed for the occasion and to impress too. Every sector of society, every race and creed… vegetarians to carnivores; men dressed as farm-animals, women with megaphones; drunkards and teetotalers alike (although it should be said this is not Lemonade Lucy territory… Geraardsbergen on Ronde day is not really a place for those who belong to the Temperance Society).
And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave,
As a contemporary construction, President Quezon’s statement regarding the duration of Act No. 671 is enlightening and should carry much weight, considering his part in the passage and in the carrying out of the law. Mr. Quezon, who called the National Assembly to a special session, who recommended the enactment of the Emergency Powers Act, if indeed he was not its author, and who was the very President to be entrusted with its execution, stated in his autobiography, “The Good Fight,” that Act No. 671 was only “for a certain period” and “would become invalid unless reenacted.” These phrases connote automatical extinction of the law upon the conclusion of a certain period. Together they denote that a new legislation was necessary to keep alive (not to repeal) the law after the expiration of that period. They signify that the same law, not a different one, had to be repassed if the grant should be prolonged.
Each of the recipients made tremendous contributions in various ways in different fields. Not only did they enjoy their work but they made a difference. So passion isn’t just about self-fulfilmment. It’s also related to contribution. Making a difference.
Honor Tracy (1913-1989) was not a fashion correspondent but a well-known journalist and writer. She had served during the Second World War in the British Women's Auxiliary Air Force from 1939 to 1941 in the intelligence department before joining the British Ministry of Information from 1941 to 1945. As well as working as a columnist and foreign correspondent for the The Observer, she wrote for the Sunday Times and the BBC and published several books, both novels and travelogues. We must be grateful to her for directing her shrewd, wry and often amused eye upon a subject that might well have seemed frivolous or irrelevant in the context of post-war devastation in Europe. Since this was published in 1947 it is likely to have been written in 1946, only a year after the end of the war.
One would think that since we are never home... it would be spotless, but it is just the opposite. Since we just occasionally stop in, sleep and eat... mess is building up. There are toys all over the place, old food leftovers in the fridge, crumbs all over the floor and laundry piling up. With little energy, I couldn't stand it anymore... so I tidied up what I could to make it look at least a little more livable. I then rewarded myself with a little DVR catch-up time and then a hot bath.

3. Washington is a petulant child who throws tantrums and engages in name-calling, and like a child whose bad behavior has been tolerated for too long, it will take a great deal of discipline to get the child back in line.
For the budding novelist hungry for fame and fortune, I am probably not a very good role model. Forgive me not providing a magic bullet for recognition and mass readership. And who knows? Lightening might strike, and you will find that your novel fulfills your hopes and dreams for recognition and, with luck, lots of money.
Something like this. Feel free to ignore the changing table, we won't need one of those again. But I love the jumbled alphabet. I found this picture on pinterest, and the idea that was typed under it was to have guests at a baby shower each pick a letter to decorate and give as a gift at the baby shower.
So the two sides have sat at odds in something of a “Mexican Standoff” for nearly a decade, with Conte periodically screaming out that he knows who is dirty and he will tell if only people will listen; and the sport keeping him at arm’s length afraid to take his word as the gospel and start sending athletes, coaches and others to “time out”. Meanwhile Conte’s cries of “dirty sport” keeps the topic of drugs in this sport at the forefront, when track and field desperately needs to close that chapter and move forward.

A few months ago, I was at Target and I spotted this necklace. The card it was attached to said, "Be Brave." I think I took a closer look because it was in the early weeks of this pregnancy and I was feeling very not-brave.

This cinematic exploration of revolutionary films comes as a direct result of the suffering and oppression I have myself witnessed in Puerto Rico, the land I was born in. Currently, we are under the rule of a government that is taking violent steps towards oppressing its people, steal as much money as it can from them and keep its poor dumb by making the prices of higher education skyrocket. All the while they smile at the media, and put on a façade, lying through their teeth every step of the way. To my surprise, this type of thing isn’t just happening in Puerto Rico, similar stories are heard from countries like France, Greece and England. Do yourself a favor and make a throrough research on revolutions across these countries, this is a world wide phenomenon. Though students in those countries have reacted in a much more violent manner then they have here in Puerto Rico. Here, students have taken a more artistic approach towards expressing their anger at whats happening. Though little by little, things are turning more violent everyday.

The district court found that the functions of the "colorant selection mechanism," as recited in claim 1, are "receiving said modified appearance signals" and "selecting corresponding reproduction signals representing values of said reproduction colorants to produce in said medium a colorimetrically-matched reproduction." The court further held that the corresponding structures are the components of the "ink correction module (ICM)." MIT does not argue that if means-plus-function treatment was appropriate, the district court erred in its conclusions regarding the function and corresponding structure of the term. Therefore, the district court’s construction will govern further proceedings.

So Sunday night I made a Roast Chicken, which was delicious! And, as there usually is, there were a ton of leftovers. 2 people can only eat so much of an entire bird at one meal. After the initial dinner, I am always stuck with the question of what to do with all the leftover meat. In the summer time salads or even tacos are the easy answer, but in the fall & winter, a casserole is hard to beat. And the king of casseroles, at least in our house is chicken pot pie.

At the counter was a crazy woman griping to anybody in the zip code about, “Truckers are even having problems, ‘La-bama this, La-bama that.’” I’m waiting to catch the ear of the counter guy to GET my spork, when she turns to me and gripes in my face, “La-bama is an asshole!”

There is a massive disconnect in this movie between the acting of the people playing the Gods (who all play their roles as if this is a massive lark) and the acting of the humans (who all play their roles as if this is ultra-serious). Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes treat their performances as if they’re making this for the Saturday morning crowd, while Sam Worthington and the rest treat their duties like they think they’re doing a remake of Gladiator. It’s in that disconnect that the movie falls apart for me; I don’t hate TITANS, but I was sort of bored by it all despite its visual prettiness.
It has been over 20 years since George H.W. Bush publicly announced the need for a New World Order in an address to the nation which came as a surprise to many, awake or not.

The goal of the conference is to create a single physical space where all branches of the online gambling market can get together, network, make and cultivate relationships. It doesn’t matter if you’re a Vendor, Regulator, Affiliate, Operator, or even if you’re in the media, this is the place where everyone can convene on the same level.

Totally different culture to my last firm which had loads of paralegals, most of which fell into three categories: a) waiting to do the LPC 2) completed the LPC but looking for a training contract or 3) obtained a training contract, but passing time between the LPC and starting said training contract. I.e. Cheap Labour (luckily nothing to the extreme of “unpaid work experience” (do note excellent posting by Little Lawyer on this and related matters if you haven’t already read it)).
This process started for me with visits to First Oasis restaurant, having known the owner for 30 years, starting when his restaurant was located in Manhattan.

All those should be considered when deciding how much to spend on a dress. Unless you plan on buying jeans/a tank/a cardi to wear with the dress, I don't see what they have to do with buying a dress. Plus, adding together what you would "normally" spend on an outfit makes no sense to me, since I have no "normal" amount spent and my daily outfits vary heavily. Though hey, if you understand this system and it works for you, far be it from me to stop you. Apparently, I'm the one out of four who thinks that is one of the strangest things she has ever heard.

Similarly he will bring together the politicians of all hues and cries by promising them mega bucks from their respective owners. This will foster a lot of healthy competition amongst the politicians as their prices and selection will depend purely on their performances, and not on any kind of muscle power. The party high command culture will make way for the board-room kind of culture as “shape-up-or-ship-out” will be the only motto that will come to determine the worth and usefulness of any politician worth his salt.
Though alcohol consumption is commonly perceived as a fairly safe activity, the trend of young adults “binge drinking” is becoming increasingly prevalent. Binge drinking is defined as consuming 5 or more drinks for men (4 or more for women) within 2 to 3 hours. This rapid consumption of alcohol causes a drastic rise in blood alcohol concentration levels, often leading to quantities far higher than the designated legal .08%.
The end result is that I learned I do not currently have a heart problem. At least none that those tests or blood work revealed. Is it possible I have some plaque build-up in my arteries? I think it is LIKELY that I have some plaque build-up in my arteries. I have treated my body like shit for all of my adult life. But it is not affecting the blood flow in my heart at present.

So apparently a newspaper has posted a story about Richard Dawkin's family and their ties to slavery. Yes, slavery was bad. Yes, his family was involved generations ago. I don't think anyone has openly denounced Richard Dawkins as a racist. However, the remarks I've found "defending" a man, who honestly doesn't need defending, have been a bit freaking disheartening. This post really isn't about Dawkins, but the atheist community in general.
He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of ALL creation. For by him ALL things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—ALL things were created through him and for him. And he is before ALL things, and IN him ALL things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent. For IN him ALL the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him to reconcile to himself ALL things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross.
One of our favorite restaurants for an after-church lunch was the Flagship. I don’t remember where it was located, but two things stand out in my memory – the real, wooden-hulled boat in the middle of the restaurant, and the absolutely delicious rum buns that were given to all diners to begin their meal. As I recall, the buns were huge – about the size of a butter plate – and came covered in a confectioner’s sugar, very rummy sauce that pooled around the bun. These were not a light amuse bouche, but somehow they never interfered with our eating the meal that followed. Years later, I returned to Washington and was greatly disappointed to find that the Flagship was gone. Rum buns were still being served at Hogate’s and we had dinner there, but the rum buns didn’t seem as good. In looking on the Web for a recipe, I found there are many people like me who remember the Flagship’s rum buns fondly.

County Councils are responsible for education, fire, police, transport, libraries and so on, across the county.

NBC's fall schedule is now in play and I have to say, it's puzzling. This network keeps trying to find its way back from last place (okay, technically the CW is last but unfortunately, that's never likely to change) but not sure their latest plan of attack, which looks to be combining comedy and drama on nearly every night with very few returning shows, is going to work. It's a choice, I suppose. But they seem to cancel more shows than anyone ... a show doesn't do well after two or three eps, it's out. And this was the network that once gave life to Cheers - not at all successful its first season but when given a second went on to be one of the net's most successful series, going 11 seasons. Times, they have changed.

Startled, she turned around and gave me the biggest hug I've had from her in a long time. She cried. I cried. My mom cried. (I guess that's not so uncommon with us though). I asked her why that song was playing and she said, "My computer just shuffled through my playlists to that song!" That made us cry even harder.

Sukkot is a holiday in which we pray for rain and return to nature due to our commitment to environmental preservation and the preservation of our resources which ensure our existence. In the Sukkah we experience the temporary nature of our existence and are forced to act responsibly towards the coming generations. It is a wonderful time in which we conclude that our security does not lie in our strength, protection, or our egos, but rather in a life filled with values and respect for human life and honor, as well as a commitment to values, justice and morality.
Bertrand Russel, in trying to delve more deeply into logic, found that he was only becoming more and more enmeshed in paradoxes – not because had misunderstood logic, but because he had misunderstood the limits of language. It may be that consciousness is a similar kind of animal – perhaps further attempts to push deeper into consciousness will only result in mystery and paradox.

Now, really, the most important thing one can do, especially in a theatre context, is try to REDUCE the amount of waste being created. In his great little manifesto of sorts, ‘How to Go Green,’ (http://ecotheater.wordpress.com/how-to-go-green/) theatre practicioner Mike Lawler talks about small and big ways a theatre company can become more environementally conscious. His first point is to “keep the word REDUCE in mind.”

In other, less urine-related, news, this blog is three years old today. I really don't know how that happened. Like most things, I think I hopped on the bandwagon just as the whole thing had reached saturation point and was becoming terminally uncool. Once I finally succumb to Twitter you can be fairly sure that that's over, too. Twitter was just getting going back then, and quickly started to gobble commenters who had stuff to say and then the kind of bloggers who only did this as a means of chatting to folks they didn't know and saying 'check this motherfucking dog video out!' Which is good for everyone, I guess, though it's certainly changed the landscape a bit. Nevertheless, blogs are still usually the best place to read articulate and uncensored writing by people without a political or commercial agenda.

Also around this time Bo Coach bid farewell to Mr Korg and brought in Casio RX-1 as well as Denise Y whom handled Casio RX-1 in shows as well as providing vocals and sound effects. Right around this time the band started to put together The Mustard Tape. In true lo fi indie rock fashion, over the span of several weekends, and various basements the songs that made up The Mustard Tape were recorded. In fact most songs on this release were recorded in a different room and on a different date. Originally the core of what was to make up The Mustard Tape were recorded by myself and the band on my old Fostex 4 track at Chris Grant's old house one drunken weekend while his parent's were out of town. Originally recorded that night were "Mannequin", "Welcome Citizens", "Fast One", and "Head On"" as well as a cover of The Velvet Underound's "Heroin" which was recored well past the inebriated state. Of those songs the only recordings that were kept for release on The Mustard Tape were "Fast One" and "Head On" as well as all of the out takes that feature Ed playing a guitar nowhere near in tune and somehow playing the melody backwards. Still to this day I can't for the life of me fathom what was wrong with the recordings of "Mannequin" and "Welcome Citizens" that we did that night. Honestly, they sounded beautiful. Especially "Mannequin" the way the violin melody and Conover's vocals so wondrously meshed together. If I recall correctly Noah quipped that they "sounded too pretty, not dirty enough" or something to that effect. And hence that is why the version of "Mannequin" that does appear on The Mustard Tape is as lo fi as possible. "Welcome Citizens" was re- worked when the band combined it with the Half Japanese-esque rambling oddity of"Uncle Roy" and performed (and subsequently recorded) it as "Uncle Roy/Welcome Citizens" at Coffee House which was like a talent show held at Shoreham Wading River High School. You were only supposed to play one song so the figured "heck with that let's make two songs one". I love that you can hear my good old buddy and band mate Mark Gill yell "Yeah Uncle Roy" in the song. It cracks me up every time.

In the case of Bobby Petrino, I’m not delighting in the story like a lot of people in the National media and fans of other programs are, but if I’m honest, a lot of the reason for that is because he’s the coach of my team, and I don’t like the ramifications of all this for me. When it comes to hearing gossip about someone I might not like as much, I don’t always do a very good job of following Dr. Allen’s words.

In that scenario, the mean global temperature in 30 years would be about 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees C) hotter than in the preindustrial era of the 1850s. Many climate scientists and policymakers have targeted a 2-degree C temperature increase as the maximum threshold beyond which the planet is likely to experience serious environmental damage. For example, in the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Accord, the United States and more than 100 other countries agreed to consider action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions "so as to hold the increase in global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius."

Remember that not long ago I blogged about going to my dentist? Now, what I did not tell you was exactly what I did there. That’s mostly because I was a little foggy about it myself. Sure, I had the regular check-up, and some fillings, and the professional cleaning. But in addition… I let myself be convinced by my doctor to be fitted for a “Schiene”. Because, she explained, it would be good for my teeth. Eh, why not?
I got a small pot roast, browned it in a little oil, topped it with packets of dry brown gravy, Italian salad dressing and a tablespoon of dry Ranch powder, then added half a cup of water and reduced the heat to a simmer. After half an hour, I added another half cup of water and after an hour added onion, carrots and celery and let it simmer, covered for 4 hours total time. Very easy, very good. The liquid thickened a little so I did not make a thicker gravy with it.

On another day, an unfamiliar personage came along with Hania. She asked me if I could tell who was standing at the foot of the table. I was about to reply that I almost never pick up names, but then, while staring at what appeared to be a vaguely human shape approaching seven feet in height, I realized that I was in fact getting one. I took the leap and said, “He says he’s Saint Francis.” (I didn’t know which St. Francis.) Hania told me that he’d appeared to her many times. OK. I try not to be surprised anymore. “He’s very tall,” I added. “Yes, he’s a big man,” she agreed.

Ember plucked the petals from her Oneiroion blooms, and scattered them along the path behind us like a flower girl at a wedding.

Let’s be very clear, dolcetto is NOT a sweet red wine! Dolcettos originate from the Piedmont region in northwest Italy along with barberas and nebbiolos. The common misconception is that because the word contains dolce (sweet in Italian) it must be a sweeter wine. The name dolcetto, however, is more of a term of endearment for the grape, meaning the little sweet one in Italian. The grape itself is small, with a thin skin which yields a wine with low tannins, a light color and mild acidity. Dolcettos tend to be dry red wines with vibrant berry notes and a silky finish. I have always found it hard describing what a dolcetto tastes like, but I like to vision it being the love child of a zin and a pinot noir. While the wine is light and fruit forward (like a pinot), it has a slightly spicy finish (zin). Due to its balanced acidity, dolcettos pair perfectly with pizza and pasta or anything that has tomatoes in it. Take it from me, nothing beats a homemade pasta dinner washed down with a bottle of dolcetto. I highly recommend it.

I have not the slightest idea why God had all of this in store for us at this time, and I don't care. I was mad at first, since I was already grieving for my grandmother and really couldn't believe that this was happening less than a week later. But it is what it is, and it could have been so much worse. His appendix was about as bad as it can get before it ruptures, which it thankfully had not. He was able to have it removed laparoscopically, which shortens recovery time. And I'm so thankful it happened while we were at home, and not travelling. We went through that in Vegas when we lost Lily, and I never want to deal with a situation like that again. Thank God it happened after we had come home from the funeral, and before we were supposed to travel to my sister's house 8 hours away. (Which of course is cancelled now.)
Eventually most of those people who are led captive by the sins of comfort, will die in captivity. A few will survive and be liberated during the battle of Armageddon. The ones who will be liberated will be the next generation that grew up in captivity. The ones who put their faith and trust in God and nothing else. The ones who did not enjoy the wicked media, the ones who did not go into debt because they were filled with greed to live above their means. The ones who found their joy in the Lord instead of the materialism of this world. Their job after Armageddon will be to bear witness to what happened. So the world can remember it and move on with life to make sure sins and crimes such as these will not be committed ever again. They will bear witness to what God did for them and their testimony will live on and God will be given the glory for everything.

Eric likes trouble and adventure. Battles get him hot and bothered. He definitely feeds off others.He’s not bringing up the future of their relationship with Sookie. He wants to turn her, but has promised not too. His long-term goal is that Sookie changes her mind? That seems unrealistic. We don’t know a lot about Eric’s early days, at least in the books so I’ll cut him some slack on that one. A lot of fanfiction assumes that Eric is promiscuous, often until he meets and falls in love with Sookie, and then he’s often portrayed as having no desire to fuck anyone else ever again. I’m not sure there is a lot of evidence for either in the text. While it’s clear Eric is very sexual, and rumored to be good in bed, this doesn’t mean he’s fucking everyone. In fact, I think it more likely that Eric would prefer to have the same partner for an extended period of time. And I think he’d be kinda picky. He’s not banging every fangbanger that throws himself at him. Though Eric is very interested in knowing if Sookie is exclusive with him, and asks her point blank, he doesn’t offer the same information about his own habits. I don’t like to think that Eric’s shacking up with fangbangers (though I don’t think he’s exclusively feeding on Sookie, or drinking bottled only when he’s not with her) there isn’t anything to contradict it in the text. I’d like to think that Eric recognizes that this is important to Sookie, but marriage for Eric doesn’t mean exclusivity. Vampires have definitely had to adapt—not abandon—their criminal ways (ie, getting your own personal telepath to help root out thieves instead of relying on messy and inefficient torture) and I think in order to survive for a thousand years amidst humans would require some great tricks to blend in. Which happen to be the same methods of deception that psychopaths used to disguise their complete lack of empathy.

Being a teenager is often about raw emotions - when even the tiniest thing that happens in life seems to matter. Maybe because a lot of what happens to teenagers is new and fresh - unlike for adults who may have gone through the same thing a dozen times in their lives. A classmate at school may say something unpleasant that makes you cry; or a boy you like may know nothing of your existence; or you may not be as pretty, intelligent and witty as you would like to be, and hate yourself for being the person you are instead... the list could go on and on. Sometimes, I get asked why teenage books are so dramatic - why the girl may constantly pine for that one boy. Well, just imagine yourself back at high school. There are a limited amount of boys there - and for a teen, high school often equates to 'the world'. Now, imagine that the one and only boy you end up liking does not like you. And again, remember - school is 'the world'. No one else is there that you like. Bummer.

So then I stopped at a small dhaba. Oota sikta? Food available? Yes, he says. He looks like a decent chap and by now I’m quite relaxed since I have nothing to lose and so I casually ask him if he can give me a place to sleep as well. He points to the bench along the wall and asks if I’d like to sleep there, sure, I say, anything. Cool then, sleep there later. How much? I ask him, best to get these things sorted right at the beginning. No money, just sleep if you want to. It’s 7:15pm, I’ve come 260k and I have a place to sleep. Excellent.

Despite all this, as had become traditional, Christopher Lee really had to be dragged into the studio and (almost literally) blackmailed into participating. And even this was at the behest of the distributors, who weren’t interested in a non-Lee Dracula movie. Hammer had originally planned to recast and relaunch the series, much as they did with their Frankenstein series in the same year, but their backers insisted that this be, nominally, part of the same continuity that started in 1958.

I am bringing this analysis to a close by asking the question as to which individuals are ultimately responsible for this scandalous situation. The age-old questions persist – Are we mere creatures of circumstance? What influence can one individual have on transforming a situation? Do modern outlooks over-emphasise the power of the individual?
Expliquer l’affaire DSK, c’est pas de la tarte. And as time goes on, it gets murkier. What, for example, was a senior executive in a subsidiary of French construction giant Eiffage doing pimping for Dominique Strauss-Kahn? David Roquet allegedly used his corporate expense account to cover part of the bill for evenings with prostitutes in Paris (at the Aventure nightclub) and the luxury Murano Hotel during 2009 and 2010. According to investigators, Roquet filed expense claims for the evening marked with Strauss-Kahn’s initials “DSK”. That means somebody above him would’ve been happy to sign off expenses marked in that way.
Ok, in truth there’s no such thing as “the” right choice when it comes picking the Kodak Zi8 or the Playsport Zx5. Both are outstanding. But the Zi8 is more than a year and a half old already and the Kodak Zx5 is brand-spanking new. So, balancing features versus price can be tough in this case.
Well, the US Armed Forces don't work that way, so we will have to look elsewhere. Where do we think Cammy and his euroweenie chums are looking? Why does the phrase "sold out" come to mind? But then, this has been on the cards for a long time, and we said this was going to happen in January 2006.

One of the highlights of the tour is the view of the Pohutu and Prince of Wales Feathers geysers. The Pohutu (meaning big splash) is the largest geyser in New Zealand, rising at times to 40 metres, and the Prince of Wales feathers is the most active geyser. It is left completely to nature when they will erupt (some places add washing powder to make their geysers erupt at set times, as washing powder contains animal fat) and generally the longer they lie dormant the higher they will rise. On average, these two geysers erupt at least once an hour and you can get a feeling of how frequently they are to erupt by the weather - on a hot clear day they will erupt less frequently but shoot higher into the sky, whereas on an overcast or rainy day, they will erupt more frequently but to a lesser extent. For the duration of our visit they erupted constantly, and the sky was overcast. The bright blue pools directly in front of the geysers make good barometers for the villagers.
He also promoted a pilot programme in Wenzhou, a city that has been a hotbed of entrepreneurism but also risky lending schemes, to encourage private investment in local banks and set up loan companies as a way to expand borrowing options.

“The sixth chakra governs our self-image; It is here we form ideas about who we are and how we should present ourselves to the world.” Pg 184We often live the messages we received from our parents and caregivers from our early years. It is important to challenge some of these ideas as we grow and develop. “Reclaiming the authentic self can be challenging and is rarely achieved without the support and guidance“of others. Pg 185 It is important to ask for help when working to overcome old messages. Seek help from teachers, healers and counselors when necessary.

They actually have very nice teachers. I am at a bit of a loss when it comes to answering their questions. I don't know why those boys do what they do. Their thought process has always stumped me. Maybe they are attention seeking but that also makes it my fault. Maybe they are genetically stubborn. My fault.

Now, technically I was travelling in the south (at least latitude-wise), and I did go to Shreveport earlier this year, but neither Florida nor Northern Louisiana can compare to New Orleans. In fact, Shreveport’s tourism board decided that the best slogan for Shreveport was “Louisiana’s Other Side,” which seems sad to me, as they might as well just say, “Shreveport: This Town Ain’t New Orleans”. Northern Louisiana is really much closer in look and feel to somewhere in Texas than the part of Louisiana that I fell in love with. I traveled there with Kristen two years ago, and with my sister a year ago, and I’m sorely missing beignets and chicory coffee in my life, so I decided to write up a little guide of some of my favorite things in New Orleans that you should try if you are ever lucky enough to visit.

I laid the pink down first, that's where I wanted to stick the letters for her teacher's name. I decided to use double sided tape because I thought it would look cleaner. I wasn't sure if glue might bleed through and then look like a mess....so I stuck with the tape. Then I put the foam stickers on to spell her teacher's name.
The Animus was an alien intelligence which landed on the planet Vortis. It could take over any living creature that was in contact with gold and had already taken control of the ant-like Zarbi when the Doctor and his companions arrived on Vortis. One of Vortis' surviving lifeforms, the Optera, referred to the Animus as "Pwodarauk". The Animus manifested itself within an organic, self-healing palace called the Carcinome.
He walked back to the camp. The engineer was very excited: Bravo Ray! The lion must be hurt bad. If the shot hit it would be in a bad shape. The shot did hit, right? Shankar couldn’t confirm whether the shot had hit or not. He fired, that’s all he could say. They searched around for a couple of days, but there was no sign of a dead or injured lion.
I came to terms with the real possibility that I won’t be having children. I am still not sure how I feel about that, but it’s ok for now.
Well, save for the Nazi who drinks from the wrong goblet in the climax. His transformation gave me the heebie jeebies for weeks afterwards. What a geat, iconic scene, no? It contributed to earning The Last Crusade a PG-13 rating, the only film in thefrancise to do so. Ironic, sense the intense elements of Temple of Doom contributed to the MPAA developing the PG-13 rating in the first place.

Nice line. But you have to wonder: if we’d cinched our sense of reality with just a bit more reason instead of mythology, maybe we’d still be seeing the ivory-bill for real. Ignoring the gloss may serve the interests of short-term expediency, but the longer-term consequences may not be so welcomed, especially within those bodies whose assertion of authority rests in knowledge claims.
My father and Almost Dr. Sis see each other for the first time that day from across the concert hall. Or maybe only he sees her. In the images we collect from that hour, my father stands against the right-hand wall leading to the stage while my sister stands on the opposite side. The room is too large to capture them both in the same frame. In my father's picture, though, he is clearly looking toward his daughter, whose own eyes are aimed at the line of deans whose hands she will soon shake.

Even seemingly irreconcilable cases like Moqtada Al-Sadr had to pay lip service to what the people want; reform, freedoms and better services. And above all, they have to eventually distance themselves from violence. Although Sadr continues to threaten with violence and tries to bend democracy to serve his purposes, the rules of the democratic game forced him to suspend most armed operations in 2008--in part--in exchange for a role in politics.

Special care needs to be taken with the lashes due to the arrangement of the individual hairs.

My cash game consists of a revolving door of bankers, dentists, politicians, car salesmen, mortgage brokers, real estate agents, a news anchor, an angel investor, and two or three boys whose occupations I can't yet pinpoint. Because the guys who run the game are in the car business, I *think* these outliers are mechanics, but I'm not sure. They are cagey and cautious, but wearily eagle-eyed in their approach. I try to avoid them in pots because I know they're there for the same reason I am - to take the big boys' money. Sometimes they're lucky. More often, they're not. Away from the table, thinking about hands, I wonder if these maybe-mechanics trade gibes on break in the garage with the salesmen about the salesman's sloppy call that got there on the river.

This being said, while studying my way through one of my books (Kathleen Staiger’s “The Oil Painting Course You’ve Always Wanted”), I have been working through some of the exercises and I can tell that they are making a real difference already! The rest of this article will outline the steps of an exercise titled “Doing a Landscape Paint-along” (pp 130ff) which has turned into a really profitable experience for me. The goal is to create a painting of a contrived landscape with some mountains in the background, some middle-ground hills, a river with an island, and a foreground area with some Aspen trees.

Figuring out thriller vs. mystery vs. suspense or paranormal romance vs. urban fantasy vs. supernatural horror can be difficult, I know. In these cases, it's best to just choose the closest and let a professional decide the best way they can sell it. But the line between literary and commercial isn't as vague. You shouldn't claim your book is literary fiction if it isn't. For one, it's rare you'll find an agent who looks for literary fiction and genre fiction with the same fervor, if they take on both at all. You don't want to get a rejection based on a mislabel. Secondly, literary fiction is quite different than genre fiction, and not learning the difference can reflect a lack of research on your part.
Another two nominations for A Book of Horrors; launching at FantasyCon always stands you in good stead for the BFAs. The jury added one title to this shortlist, but I couldn't guess which.

Your main core muscles consist of the abdominals, obliques, lower back and glutes. People fail to realize the increased fitness potential that can be obtained through the strengthening of these muscles. The countless and unnecessary injuries that people face day to day can be attributed to both poor balance and a lack of functional strength. At FLEX, class participants are introduced to new exercise techniques that really challenge these muscles. Some of our favorite core exercises are plank, side plank, abdominal curl, V-ups, superman (varying arm and leg positions), gluteal bridge, sphinx/cobra pose, bridge and child’s pose.

Today will be the "celebration" of Cinco De Mayo, a holiday hardly recognized in Mexico but celebrated with gusto north of the border. The reality is that the date is the anniversary of a small battle in 1862 where Mexican forces defeated a force of French occupiers. It was a minor episode as far as such things go. To the north, the American Civil War was raging where the celebrated Mexican battle would have been considered a minor skirmish. Barely a footnote in history, if that.

To me, it is now the right time for all sensible Malaysians to start thinking of how to do our part in influencing our Government to listen to our needs, after so many opinions and suggestions. Really we do not need another political grouping. Whether it is BN or Pakatan, we cannot depend absolutely on politicians as power corrupts and absolute power corrupts even worse. What is needed is strong NGOs grouping to check and balance the politicians. Not opposition parties but effective NGOs.
The way they won the series speaks to itself about their greatness. Facing 15 points and 1-0 series lead in the fourth quarter of Game 2, the home team Miami Heat started celebrating as they believed they would make a sweep. But the trailed Mavs were resistant and then made the memorable 22-5 comeback run in the last 7 minutes to tie up the series. And the last quarter comebacks returned in Game 4 and Game 5, before clinching the title in the convincing Game 6 at Heat’s home court. They even crushed the Heat defense by passing by century mark points in the last two games.

The second match of the night was Lord Tensai vs. R-Truth. Since his debut a few weeks back, Tensai has proved to everyone in the WWE that he’s a legitimate threat. He’s currently undefeated, and most of his matches leave his opponents in almost a vegetative state when the final bell rings. This match was no exception. Tensi dominated most of the match before using the mysterious green mist to leave R-Truth almost unconscious. Tensai then pinned Truth to earn another victory.

M.S: I wrote the first draft of SUMMIT AVENUE when I was living in Innsbruck, Austria, where I was teaching English at a Catholic girls' boarding school as part of a Fulbright Fellowship. It was winter in the Alps and my room was barely heated. Every night after work, I'd huddle under the covers and write longhand into a spiral notebook. I didn't have television and I'd run out of books to read. This was how I relaxed in my spare time. The squalor of my accommodations (there was mildew on the walls) was the inspiration for John's room in the novel.
As the crisis heads into what is termed a “double dip” recession, imperialism has its tentacles spread thin. Three wars, responsible for countless tens of thousands of civilian deaths, are being run by the Democrats, while covert actions and drone strikes cross more borders than Wikileaks can keep up with. The workers of North Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and China are attacking their governments and taking massive strike and protest actions. With the collapse in the bailouts of Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and the potential downgrading of the USA's bond rating by Moodys, it is clear the big bosses of the world economy see no way out except imposing massive austerity measures, which they expect the trade union leaders, the Social Democrats, the Labor Parties, and, in the USA, the Democratic Party to administer. And the class traitors at the head of our unions are following right along – witness SEIU Local 1000's endorsement of Governor Brown's regressive tax plans in California.
Only it's not. Not by a mile. Dawkins NEVER says things science can't explain don't exist. Ever. This is not the last time Chopra comes off looking like he didn't even read the book. He goes on about how the sainted Einstein believed in God (he didn't, and Dawkins went to some effort to point that out), he continually said that Dawkins said the universe was created by random chance (wrong again), and even referred to one of the analogies Dawkins debunked (the 747 put together by a hurricane) to support his arguments about the non-random nature of the universe. Sheesh. This guy calls himself a doctor? He also obviously woefully misunderstands quantum physics, and mistakes Dawkins for some sort of 19th century objective materialist who subscribes only to the narrowest interpretations of Newtonian physics. Of course, this is all crazily off-base. And his coup de grace? His way of knowing there is a God? Because consciousness transcends matter. We can think thoughts with our mind, which has to be more than just the chemicals it's made of. Well doesn't it? He even petulantly asks, "Do you think you are conscious and intelligent, or are you being fooled by random chemical reactions inside your skull?"
The government urges us in this case to uphold a direct prohibition on political speech. It asks us to embrace a theory of the First Amendment that would allow censorship not only of television and radio broadcasts, but of pamphlets, posters, the Internet, and virtually any other medium that corporations and unions might find useful in expressing their views on matters of public concerns.

Mulligan and Monk play together, they rise in melody and harmony, but they also battle. At times what they play seems to fight. Monk hitting broken chords while Mulligan is sweet and sad. At other times, the roles are altered. Monk is playful, almost childlike while Mulligan is delirious, dissonant and atonal. Their relationship through this 7 minute piece is strained, tense, periodically combative but ultimately positive. They don't agree on everything--but they come through with the goods.

Paranormal private eye. Grim reaper extraordinaire. Whatever. Charley Davidson is back in Darynda Jones' Third Grave Dead Ahead! And she’s drinking copious amounts of caffeine to stay awake because, every time she closes her eyes, she sees him: Reyes Farrow, the parthuman, part-supermodel son of Satan. Yes, she did imprison him for all eternity, but come on. How is she supposed to solve a missing persons case, deal with an ego-driven doctor, calm her curmudgeonly dad, and take on a motorcycle gang hellbent on murder when the devil’s son just won’t give up?
At the Social, good ideas are still seen as good ideas as long as production values are "good enuff" (Can they see it? Check? Can they hear it? Good, ship it and see how it fares on YouTube and Digg). And bad ideas aren't made any better on the social web because they were shot expensively (honestly all that gloss goes over the heads of low bandwidth viewers who are skeptical of commercial gloss).

TO DO Make a personal affirmation from a Bible verse and say it first thing every morning for the next week.
It’s an author’s responsibility to put her characters through as many traumas as possible. Readers want to worry about characters, they want to see how characters act when faced with horrendous conditions and dilemmas, and they want the characters to go bravely where they themselves would never go. As an author, I might give readers what they want, but frankly, I would never choose to be in any of the situations my characters encounter. And, although I am trying to be bold and brave in my own life, I will never be as bold as my characters. Nor do I want to be.

I noted in the comments from Monday’s post that the leveling BG brackets are pretty brutal for completing these. You wouldn’t know that by how Monday night went. Maybe I just got unlucky on Sunday? Here’s my Monday night play-by-play….
I feel like all I do is reach out to people to show them how much I care about them and all I get in return is forgotten.
Okay, ready? So, the literal reason I find this funny is the notion that god, as envisioned by most monotheistic religions, might essentially have made a straight up statistical error. If you look at the means- life spans are getting longer, crime rates are going down, happiness is generally increasing- on the whole, it looks like a pretty good world. Once you start paying attention to the dispersion, however, suddenly things snap into a different kind of focus. It's a useful way of pointing out that the story we tell can in many instances depend on what data we're paying attention to, and if you're not paying attention to all of the relevant data, you're probably missing something.
Three weeks ago, the State Department's Middle East Partnership Initiative sent Congress what's known as a "congressional notification," requesting permission to shift $29 million in funds from other programs in the region. State wants to shift $20 million to democracy promotion efforts in Tunisia and around the region. Another $7 million would go supporting rule of law and political development programs in the Middle East. $1 million would go to youth councils in Yemen.

But in the end, this movie cost $25 million to make. Yeah, count 'em: twenty-five million bucks, all for a movie about guys arm wrestling. Unfortunately the big arm wrestling contingent didn't come out in full force (must have had to have washed their ball caps or something) and Over The Top earned back a little over $16 million. Ouch. Not even a Giorgio Moroder soundtrack featuring Sammy Hagar, Asia, Eddie Money, Frank Stallone (natch) and Kenny Loggins could help earn any more than this back to help Sly and company turn their epic into anything less than a mis-step of gargantuan proportions.
I don't have one of Spencer to show for this year. It is the first year I didn't take one of him in the early morning darkness before he catches the bus. This year he was up until midnight the night before school working on a school project that was due the very first day of school. He had put it together wrong and had to redo the whole thing.

Because the finished broadcast was superb. It wasn't my story, but it was great radio. At my suggestion they had cast Conor Lovett, the finest Beckett actor of his generation, as the 18-year old Jude. The BBC had started by auditioning 18 and 20 year olds straight out of drama school. When I reacted with horror, and suggested Conor Lovett, they auditioned him and loved him and cast him. Trust me, the lack of ego required to do that, and the sensitivity to the writer's suggestions, would never occur in, say, the film industry.
I was suprised how well the clovers came out on the cookie and how little the sugar actually melted once baked.

Given all the photos I've taken in my lifetime, it's hard to believe I forgot to take BEFORE photos here! We were so busy jumping right into the work that it simply slipped my mind! I think it's time to pass the official family photog torch on to V who loves to capture images whenever she can wrest my camera from me.
If you have been following me on Facebook, you already know that I have been in contact with my church about one of the 20+ short term (one week) mission trips that are available this year. The only problem is that the Summer ones are full and the Fall ones are filling up quickly. All I really need to do is decide on one and pay the $100 deposit to secure my spot. So what's the big deal? Sounds simple enough, right? Well, the ones available a few weeks ago were Thailand, India, Cuba, Sudan, Indonesia, Guatemala, or Romania. Since I feel that the compass in my heart points to Africa for a number of reasons, I immediately started praying about the Sudan trip. After much fasting and prayer, I emailed Brooke in the Global Disciple-Making department at church. For safety reasons, the trip required a 1:1 male/female ratio and the female portion was already filled. Bummer. She emailed me back and told me to contact Sheryl, another member of our faith family who, along with her husband, have started One Way Ministries and had already let her know that I would be contacting her. I emailed Sheryl and found out that they had a trip available to UGANDA but would need the money for the ticket by June 1st. Uganda?!?! Seriously?? I was literally moved to tears when I got the email. Is this the same Uganda where Katie lives? The same Uganda that I saw in her blog? The same Uganda through which my heart was first stirred for the plight of the orphan? The same Uganda that forever changed my life? It was. It took me the whole next day to catch my breath. Think I'm exaggerating? You have no idea. So, I checked the website to find that the trip she was talking about would be $4000 for 2 weeks. 2 weeks? I would do ANYTHING for one week, so 2 weeks really got my heart to fluttering :) But not so fast. I only had $1500 and it took me 4 months to get that much. So, I caught my breath and took a break from Facebook so I could fast and pray about Uganda.
Tuesday my sister came home from the hospital. While she was resting in the afternoon we zipped back to Jamestown Settlement to view the Galleries that we had skipped on Monday. We learned about the slaves of the Virginia colonies, early settlers and the Native Americans. We spent about five hours of time, over two days, enjoying the Jamestown experience.
It was also fun checking out the towering wine lockers at the lobby as well - for a moment we imagined what it would be like to visit a place like The Capital Grille so much that you would pay for your own space to store your own wines - so highroller that you get a bronze plaque with your name on it.

Part of Wharton’s genius is in her narrative voice. She generally stays in Archer’s (somewhat fatuous) consciousness, but regularly steps back to analyze the limits of his outlook. And while she is kind to him, she is also pitiless, for Archer has just enough imagination to feel superior to his milieu, and just little enough to stay tethered to it. On the one hand, he scorns his beautiful but limited fiancée May Welland, yet she is canny enough to tie him to her for life. So who won in the end? Wharton is also savage about the fate of women in the social New York of her childhood, a sequence of girlhood ignorance and matronly acquiescence, both partnered by masculine hypocrisy. Women, the narrator states, are to be forgiven for lying to their husbands since “A woman’s standard of truth was tacitly held to be lower: she was the subject creature, and versed in the arts of the enslaved.”

“Yoga Man”, a dry, satirical comedy with absurdist flourishes, was directed by the talented Rob Lambert, who I also had the privilege of co-writing the script with. It was a 5 day shoot that took place around December-ish 2009. Rob had a very distinct vision of what he was going for in tone, something in between Fletch and Donnie Brasco, but with Evil Yogi’s instead of gangsters.

Alcohol minimum pricing is one of the features of denormalising alcohol and is akin to the high tax placed on smoking. No one really believes 50p per unit will have any discernable effect on consumption or behaviour. However it begins the model placed on smoking and allows for future increases. Those increases are likely to be an accelerator above inflation and gradually the price of a can of lager will creep up and up. It’s immediate effect negligible, its effect 20 years down the line one of very expensive booze and declining numbers of boozers.

However, when I got to chapter on the 2010 Iron Bowl, I had a minor revelation. While I had enjoyed the book up to that point, I was not sure if it was really something that I could get on board with, mostly because of the disagreement listed above. A nice work, I thought, but not something that I was going to heartily recommend. Then, when I read Nomel’s story of attending the Iron Bowl in Tuscaloosa, I abandoned the divinity school mindset that I had occupied for most of the book – one of academic analysis, critical reading and thorough combing of details – and slowly realized that I had felt every emotion that T.C. had mentioned thus far. From the despair of Alabama’s rise to the hopefulness of the 2009 campaign to the joy of the 2010 season, the Psalms had served as a way to highlight and remember those moments.
Austin & MacAuley describe themselves as an independent trade publisher, but unlike many of the other trade publishers located in London and anywhere else for that matter, we are not told who their editors or senior personnel are (nor their background or experience), nor how much publishing skills they bring with them—and more to the point—what history and experience Austin & MacAuley actually has as a publisher.

He gives us the impression that something happened - so general and vague - without even he has been touched by the fact. Distances himself completely from the event and do not recognize any responsibility for the financial and personal deadlock in the government of the country and to himself. The tragedy of the situation is a rhetorical matter of act that is designed to emphasize that all these happen every day and everywhere. He starts to say that whatever happened , happened , and not to deal with such things because there are worse.

By refusing to take up Russia's traditional role of defender of the Orthodox Faith and of all Islamic oppressed Christians, soon to be again President Putin, is allowing an incredible opportunity to slip away. We should be having close contacts and military exchanges with these nations. We should support them politically, running interference for them in the UN, where one Russian vote is worth more then all 54 of the Satanic-Islamic votes.

Herpes Simplex Virus One (HSV1): Oral Herpes/Cold Sores - there are those who don’t even consider this an STI because, although it can be transmitted sexually, so can just about any virus, including the flu.

So you can get it from a parent, aunt or uncle, grandmother, friend, friend of a friend, etc. Just like a cold or the flu or strep throat, among other viruses.

Betty starting school was by far the most emotional thing to happen in 2011. Where she has embraced it wholeheartedly, I still haven't quite come to terms with the fact my first-born isn't at home with me and making glittery play dough, day in and day out. And her new way of talking doesn't sit pretty with me either, you know, where every sentence goes up at the end. I don't like the whole having to wear black shoes thing either.

He did one thing that week that I always wanted him to do ,but he would never ,and that was to sit in my lap ,that is when I really knew . Well on the evening of March 23 ,he went in to the bathroom ,and only wanted his Mama (Carrie ) in there .

The most common complaint I have heard from Nigerians about their country concerns corruption.

Today was an extremely busy day for Me, and I just happened to be in one of My unpredictable moods - and one just never knows what that might mean for My clients. So today I didn't feel that I was in the right frame of mind to let My client's masturbate. I felt like being mentally sadistic, so I inflicted the most severe kind of torture, simply because it was My desire to do so. My slaves are here for My pleasure and entertainment, so I was perfectly within My rights. I decided that today all of My clients either had to be bound with ropes or cuffs, or rubberized and then teased mercilessly with My wonderful Venus. When they came very close to releasing, I simply clicked the Venus to the "off" position and set it aside with no intention of using it further. Groveling and begging didn't help their cause one bit, although there was a lot of it. I think I even saw tears. But I was all about creating sexual frustration today. I succeeded as I left them with extremely engorged genitals. And no, it isn't just a matter of time before they can go home and "fix" their little problems in the privacy of their own bathrooms or bedrooms. Some of them were so frustrated they might have even tried in the elevator on the way down. But no, I couldn't allow that. Because I need to constantly amuse Myself at the expense of my clients and slaves, I decided I'd keep today's prisoners in chastity and the only way they would be set free is to come back in a week or go to a locksmith..... I think they'll be coming back, begging for me to offer up the chastity keys that I placed on my key-ring. Unfortunately, there's no telling what mood I might be in when they return. Hopefully, for their sakes, it will be a merciful one. God I love this job!

What is often overlooked is the fact that most Afrikaners are not descended from the Boers hence the distinction between Boer & Afrikaner is a valid / poignant & relevant distinction. The Afrikaners -as a macro group- were not the successors of the Boers contrary to common interpretation as the Boers were & are a minority within the Afrikaner designation - a designation which relates mainly to the descendents of the Afrikaans speakers from the Western Cape who were formerly known as the Cape Dutch - but due to the Afrikaner appropriation of the Boers' history- many people erroneously think that the Afrikaners were a product of the Boers but Boer self determination & traditions were supplanted & discarded by the rise of the Cape based Afrikaners & their political outlook. The Boer people did not consent to the their usurpation as the Boers were left impoverished after the Anglo-Boer War whereupon they were left looking for work in the cities & were susceptible to the Cape based Afrikaner intellectuals who began to co-opt them within a political framework most notably under the rubric of Afrikaner Nationalism in which Boer aspirations were hijacked & had to submit to the political agenda as directed by the Cape based Afrikaners & particularly their Broederbond which was the driving force behind Afrikaner Nationalism & the National Party which later won power.
So this year’s upcoming business meeting has an interesting little By Law change propsed (via the Board) to reduce the ‘excessively costly’ annual meetings. Buried in the motion are provisions that hand effective budget control over to the Board and reduce the power of the Governing Council to almost, a nullity but for elections of officers, which will be done from candidate lists largely controlled by the Board.

So, after reading Dave Ramsey's book, The Total Money Makeover, I definitely see how our finances need to change. We are starting the envelope system. I'm super excited to start this and come out of debt. I'd love to buy a house, and we're just right below where we can, but we want to make sure we are completely debt free before starting that process. I would love to be in Clarksville, especially for Braden since he will be starting Kindergarten next year, and the home school program I want to use through K12 doesn't have one in Kentucky, and the one that we could use cost almost $5000. Also with the possibility of Brendon getting out of the Army, I think this will help a lot.
I have been in love with Jane Austen’s stories for as long as I can remember. When I was twelve, I read Pride and Prejudice and was hooked. Perhaps, it was being a product of the 1950s and 1960s. Those decades were a male dominated period (Have you ever watched “Mad Men”?). Jane Austen’s works looked at society through a comedic screen while examining issues found in a male dominated world. Charlotte Lucas symbolizes the prevailing attitude toward women, while Elizabeth Bennet does not condemn feminine “virtues,” but rather balances them with a sensible mind. In each of Austen’s novels, the main characters have experiences that create a profound and permanent transformation (Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice; Marianne Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility; Emma Woodhouse in Emma; Anne Elliot in Persuasion; Catherine Morland in Northanger Abbey; and Edmund in Mansfield Park). Austen’s witty, satirical approach to her subjects resonates across the centuries.
Well, I have now covered this battle and another post about it (tangentially) all the times I’m planning on covering it. I wasn’t going to go into such detail again with the kids, but they really like acting out battles.

The male role model is also changing, but not to the same degree as the female, for every Ashley Cole or Pete Doherty, our celebrity culture still embraces a few remaining chiselled jawed men who would not took out of place in the company of Cary Grant and David Niven. But where are the Ann Todds, the Margaret Lockwoods the Joan Greenwoods or indeed the Deborah Kerrs? How often does one see a female celebrity under 50 who could be fairly called a lady?. There may be some but there are not many left and they do not appear in the magazines our children read or the TV shows they watch.

Locally, since being well beaten in the general election, her profile has been low.

Our children arrived exactly as they were designed. They are a direct and unmistakable gift from God.

Not all candidates are up to the challenge but for the most part they do put on a show of family devotion that is there to soothe the apprehension of the voter to at least assume that he/she must be a “good person” if the wife and progeny are willing to stand alongside and smile.

In addition, applications are now open to all prospective students to start regional programmes at the Bachelors and Masters level in September 2012.

I ask Archangel Michael all the time for his guidance on channels and one thing I notice about him is that he’s very tolerant of … how shall I say it? … divergences among channelings. He’ll often say that such-and-such a message was not correct, but he still recommends continuing to post the channel. In cases where he doesn’t feel the channel is credible (period), I respond by not posting the channel; where he simply feels the message itself is off, I may not post that message but I’ll post others by the same channel.

However, regarding the settlement enterprise across the 1949 cease-fire line, in territories captured after 1967, Gans rules that Jewish historical rights are subject to a morality-versus-justice argument, and that this increased settlement is morally unjustified given that Jews have already achieved their primary right, self-determination, in lands to which they possess historical rights.

Repetition to the contrary, I definitely had a series of mini panic-attacks in the three days before my procedure. Every light in the corner of my eye, every bump, every afterimage, was a bad sign. When we finally made it to the waiting room, there were three people, and even a trashy magazine or two. I filled out minimal paperwork. Two minutes later, they called me back to the actual waiting room, the one filled with shoe lifts and boring magazines.

People who decry China’s lack of innovation have clearly not seen northern-Chinese women’s longjohns stores (whole stores), remarked on earlier. The elaborate variety is hard to describe – shapes, colors, fabrics, amounts of padding, levels of dressiness, with body-molding to make you bigger or smaller in six different ways…while keeping you warm. But it’s spring now and guess what, non-longjohn undies are even more amazing. Not (at least around campus) so much black lace, goth-vampire. I mean kaleidoscopic gumball craziness. So bright, so fun, so wacky-cartoony, so anime. I have no interpretation yet. Just throwing it out there!

Richard Branson started his working life in the 60’s by starting a magazine called, ‘Student’ and has never looked back. He is an entrepreneur that defies the usual rules of business. He sold his record label and company and started Virgin Atlantic defying convention and established business practices as he not only had no experience of the airline industry but was also stepping into a hugely competitive marketplace. He also took on the might of British airways when he claimed that his business had been the victim of a ‘dirty tricks’ campaign. In both cases, he proved that he could ‘win’ and has since gone from strength to strength.

I’ve been carrying around my “metro notes,” as I’ve taken to calling them, for about two weeks now. So far I’ve gotten the occasional curious peek from fellow riders, but since no one can read my handwriting, I feel pretty safe. Yesterday, though, I had my first in-your-face encounter. (It’s a fact of life: do something out of the ordinary on the metro, and it will eventually get commented on.) I got accosted by a guy with loads of acne and hair gel, wearing a suit about a size too big, who wanted to know: “Is that your diary? You write really fast–do you think as fast as you write? Faster? What are you writing? Are you a writer?” His parting words to me, just before I finally managed to lose him in the crowd at Gallery Place, were, “You should write about my life. That book would be very fascinating.”

Hi everyone. It's time again to introduce you to another talented undiscovered Etsian and this evening I'd like to introduce you to Donna of Donna's Garden Shop.
It was predetermined that I love the Marais even before I landed in Paris the first time. An art history student at Saint Mary's College (Notre Dame, IN), I studied under the one art historian there, whose specialties were Impressionism and French Medieval. The same semester I met my French boyfriend, I was taking courses in both areas, including a course on French cathedrals. When I bounced into her office screaming, I'm going to France!, she immediately become my helping hand, providing lists and recommendations and tips. But there was one special place she most wanted me to experience--her most favorite place: the Place des Vosges in the Marais, where she used to study during her dissertation research time in France. It's funny how deeply her love for that spot then impacted me. It's as if love is contagious, transmitted through babbling stories.

In an altered state, because of the drugs and the liquor, Casey was mentally stunned, spiritually weakened, and physically in pain. She just knew she would never make it through the night. To comfort herself, she thought about her parents. She wondered if they would ever find her body. She imagined that they would miss her. She thought about how the boys were going to kill her. She was terrified that they would leave her naked in the woods with no hope of discovery. Thinking about her short life, and she just knew her parents would be so upset that she let all this happen.

And yet it forms something of a cycle of Resnais films over the last twenty years (including a pair of Alan Ayckbourn adaptations and a filmed version of the Barde/Yvain 1925 operetta, Pas sur la bouche), which seem to suggest the veteran director is becoming more light-hearted in his twilight years. Resnais’ increasingly playful approach to narrative, as well as the very medium of filmmaking (and film-watching), is no more apparent than in his most recent feature – and 2009 Cannes selection – Les herbes folles (The Wild Grass).

him: First let me thank you for expressing yourself with a truthful opinion I’m not offended or angry as a women you see fault in my behavior and you are making a assessment without the facts.What you fail to understand is a man who has sacrifice and given his all to keep his family in a comfortable lifestyle over a consistent period of time develops hormones issues.This stems from work, T.V and everyday activity.Some men deal with it differently some drink do drugs go to strip clubs or prostitutes.I choose to continue to be me because I’m not a hypocrite or a low self esteem man.I approach good women of strong character because they can challenge my intelligence and argue their point in a logical and respectful description.I know there are good women who were hurt by there mates or husband and would feel bias about my technique of adultery.I’m not a dog who when in heat goes running I’m a professional and so is my wife we graduated from college and been with each other since kids.The truth is my dear there are some men who have given there wives more than any man could ever possibly duplicate because of consistency.I never had and affair before but I’m at a point where good single educated women will not ignore my pursuit of them because they will understand what they are getting.You have single women who have been lied to by married men and then dumped because some immature men play games.I ‘m a grow man I’m not about BS my life at home is a foundation that can not be broken its not to take my wife for granted but she is educated and spiritually grounded.If she was to ever experience the hardship of her husband sleeping with another women her first impression would be what kind of women did I sleep with.Any real man who respects his wife will not sleep with a women of low standards or opposite of her character.I don’t feel good about what I’m doing but I can assure you the women who allows me to fill her void because she is tired of finding losers will appreciate this man.I can’t promise her nothing but what the characteristic of a good man lives by.I hope you have some what of a better understanding of why us men do the things we do and your heart can mend from anyone who broke your heart if that’s the case.You take care and be well because this brother loves you. kev

But the seatpost itself is immoveable, and the boys at Kidsons are reluctant to take it out anyway. They pointed out a barely perceptable bulge in the frame where the bottom end of the seat post would be sitting inside the frame. This is apparently a result of corrosion inside, from moisture getting inside at some point, and some weird-arse reaction between the steel and alloy seat post (hey, don’t ask me, it seemed plausible. And besides, I’ll believe anything.)

Today, I sat down in front of the stereo for a proper listen to the entire CD and found it to be a very interesting album. As progressive music sometimes does, this album follows no set of musical rules or norms, which is what makes it different even from a lot of prog metal. Having two vocalists in the band (one male, one female) allows for a lot of creativity in the songs. In particular, there are times throughout the album where the two vocalists are singing different melodies and lyrics at the same time and it sounds just beautiful. The album is done similar to the back-and-forth vocals in Shadow Gallery’s “Tyranny”album. This is a very diverse album in that there are both heavy passages as well as very tranquil ones, all woven into the story that is being told. The keyboarding is amazing and is showcased in a few places, with some obvious jazz influences.
When I started the Super Earthling blog, I told my husband and daughter I wanted them to be a part of it so it could be a family enterprise. It was important that they each have their own separate “Super” moniker, and I told them I’d create avatars for them according to their specifications.

As for Mister Rogers himself.., well, he doesn’t look at the story in the same way that the boy did or that I did. In fact, when Mister Rogers first told me the story, I complimented him on being so smart–for knowing that asking the boy for his prayers would make the boy feel better about himself–and Mister Rogers responded by looking at me at first with puzzlement and then with surprise. “Oh, heavens no, Tom! I didn’t ask him for his prayers for him; I asked for me. I asked him because I think that anyone who has gone through challenges like that must be very close to God. I asked him because I wanted his intercession.”

5) You can choose not to tip. Tips are discretionary here in France as service charge is often included in the bill when you dine at restaurants/brasseries/cafés. If you appreciate the service provided by the waiter/waitress, you can choose to leave a few euros or your spare change as it is uncertain if the owner actually splits the service charge he collects with his employees. In the top-notch restaurants which pride themselves on tip-top service, I would choose to leave some tips (though I would not exceed 8-10% of the total bill).

When my ID and name checked out to be clean Officer Motor Bike came over to me to let me know that everything was good. All he needed to do was look at my pictures. This was nearly my breaking point. After dealing with them and knowing that I didn’t have to answer any of their questions I was finally able to muster a semblance of courage and said ‘OK, You can see that I have been cooperating with you over this. Wouldn’t you agree?’ The four officers directly surrounding me all nodded in agreement. Then I said ‘In an effort to just get this over with I will show you the pictures as long as you realize that I know I have every right to not show them to you.’ I was prepared to be arrested and sent to the Capitol Hill Police booking office. The one solace in all of this is that it was not DC police giving me the shakedown. Central booking is not a place I want to ever visit. Not even as a member of a guided tour.

We talked last week in our group about actual hunger versus a craving. Cravings, for me, are usually driven by emotions, and often involve a fixation on a certain category of foods, like cakes/cookies/bread-things, or fries/queso & chips/salty things.
