The latter is played by Tilda Swinton in her worst neurasthenic masochist mode (she somehow won the best actress prize at the European Film Awards).

If Berkman, Beltran, or Holliday hits the DL for an extended period or underperforms, then Craig will play every day – but I don't think that's the kind of "best-case" anybody has in mind. So let's assume Holliday stays healthy enough to start 150 games, and the Killer B's start 135 games apiece, and all three are productive. If Craig always fills in on their respective days off, and picks up another half-dozen starts as the DH in interleague road games, he'd be in the lineup 66 times, for about 270 plate appearances. Toss in another 75 PA off the bench, and we're looking at roughly 350 trips to the plate for Mr. Craig.

Every single one of those cheese dishes was a fat-bomb, which sets up a fun contrast for the Elimination Challenge, when the chefs will have to make low-calorie versions of the fat-loaded favorites of the contestants from NBC's "The Biggest Loser." The cross-promotion between "Top Chef Masters" and "The Biggest Loser" is more than a tad shameless (NBC's parent company also owns Bravo), the sort of sweeps-week stunt normally reserved for struggling prime-time dramas. But once the "Biggest Loser" contestants and the chefs start mingling, you realize that the chefs actually have something to learn from people who have struggled with weight loss. Several chefs note that they don't think about calories or fat content, and that they need to pay better attention to it.

You'd have to be a heartless brute not to be moved by "Bully," Lee Hirsch's documentary that shows the emotional impact of this special breed of adolescent intimidation on its victims and their families. Where many adults look away from the problem, Hirsch points his camera exactly where it hurts the most - at a child's shame, a mother's helplessness, an administrator's obliviousness, a father's grief in the wake of his bullied child's suicide - and captures the emotional complexity that arises when school bullying is allowed to fester.

More than a decade after restaurateur Ken Stewart opened his "country" Lodge in the rural stretch between Akron and Cleveland, he still draws crowds. Large portions, skillful preparations and often exciting flavors apparently trump downtown prices. KSL offers an appealing menu of solid if standard options -- but the real surprises are on Stewart's extensive list of specials. (On one Friday night, the daily options reached a dizzying 25 to memorize.) With a market price of $59 for the pound-portioned King Crab cocktail, or $69 for the 32-ounce porterhouse, it's very easy to tick up a very stiff tab here. That said, the dishes we sampled were universally delicious. Included were a platter-sized plate of plump, well-crisped calamari big enough for a big entree, and an excellent Oysters Rockefeller lashed with hints of Pernod and pristine oysters practically shimmering with briny flavor. A shellfish saute (extra-large shrimp and scallops, plus manila clams, mussels and a somewhat grainy lobster claw) was done up in a Thai-inspired coconut cream sauce with just enough heat to excite. Though the Lodge's interior is showing signs of wear (and the booths remain too snug for easy comfort), its kitchen has as much vitality as the day it opened.

Dudley's queue is creative but cramped and humid. We were happy to be placed finally in the log and encounter several hills and bumps that pushed water into our laps. It was nice to breathe in the open air, and from the high spots we could admire the theme park landscape, including Hogwarts and Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit next door at Universal Studios.

In his 50 minutes, Nelson argued that knowledge, notice and negligence were the key to determining whether an event that occurred in a span of "milliseconds" was a crime. Senser's actions before, during and after the crash were consistent with the claim that she didn't know she'd hit someone, he argued.
Williams opened strong, hitting six aces and making two early breaks to take the first set. Sharapova broke at love to even the score at 2-2 in the second set, but she quickly squandered her break with a costly sixth double-fault to fall behind for good. Williams sealed her seventh straight win over Sharapova with a slam.

I visit a lady named Olga, who was born in the village and still lives there 70 years later. She has a religious icon in a corner of the room, something that would have been unthinkable 20 years ago, when such things were kept hidden away.
That's roughly the tab for real estate-related tax incentives given out by state and local governments in the St. Louis region since 2000. It's a conservative estimate, gathered from public records on seven major programs. It does not include tax abatements or state bond programs, which would make the total figure substantially higher. Here's how the $3.5 billion breaks down:
Bernard Maybeck: Architect of Elegance, by Mark Anthony Wilson; photography by Joel Puliatti (Gibbs Smith; 232 pages; $60). This book is a natural for anyone captivated by Maybeck, perhaps the Bay Area's most evocative 20th century architect. Landmarks like the Palace of Fine Arts are here, but so are homes that have never been photographed, as well as such lesser-known treasures as Carmel's public library.
Multiple small meals and regular exercise are prescriptions for good health. Then comes Thanksgiving — one giant late-afternoon feast that's often preceded by long hours of travel and accompanied by more hours of football watching.

F. Scott Fitzgerald famously said there are no second acts in American life. Fact of it is, just about everyone gets a second act. Even acknowledging his occasional and very public missteps, what Mike Wallace did after he turned 50 will forever rank him as a first-ballot Hall of Fame journalist.
Notes: Canucks F Dale Weise dressed in favor of Zack Kassian on the fourth line and was effective with Manny Malhotra and Mason Raymond. ... Canucks forward Ryan Kesler did not score a goal in his final 17 games of the season. ... Kings forwards Anze Kopitar (one goal, three assists) and Justin Williams (four assists) had their four-game points streaks snapped. The Canucks led 1-0 after two periods, but could have had a wider edge if not for the heroics of the Kings' Jonathan Quick.

The Mexico-based company claims to have revolutionized the movie-going experience by creating an experience around the traditional 'going-to-the-movies.' The six-theatre complex will not only provide the latest in movie-viewing technology including 2D and 3D viewing, but create a destination spot to mingle with friends and community members in a setting that would be similar to the lobby of a high-end hotel.

As a young man, he knew he didn't want to stay on the farm, so he headed to college in North Carolina to study chemistry. After he served in the Korean War, he and his wife, Metra, settled in Bishopville, S.C., about 150 miles from his childhood home. The young family bought a farm, but had to wait until the corn crop was finished to start work on their house in 1980.
In 2006, the conglomerate acquired Pixar Animation Studios for $7.4 billion in stock. Pixar created this summer's animation hit "Up" and was the creative force behind 1995's "Toy Story," and more recently "Cars," "The Incredibles," and "Finding Nemo."

Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston play George and Linda, a happily plugged-in New York couple struggling to find their place in the big city. After one spectacularly bad day -- George's office is shut down by an FBI raid, while Linda's documentary on penguins with testicular cancer gets rejected by HBO -- the jobless, recession-battered couple pack up their car and head south to Atlanta, where George's rich brother, Rick, has offered him a job at his porta-potty business (apparently the film had a bathroom-humor quota to meet).

Then, after only one season on "Charlie's Angels," Fawcett decided she wanted out of the show that had made her a global icon. Whether she was doing it out of ego and ambition, or because she felt the workload (and popularity) of "Angels" was hurting her marriage to Majors, the move backfired. She and Majors separated in 1979 (though their divorce wasn't final until 1982) and Fawcett proved unready -- either as a performer or as a canny selector of material -- to be a movie star.

Griffin is that amazing.
While I chose the obstetrician/hospital/epidural route, which I do not regret in the least, many of the mothers I know choose to use midwives and, in some cases, give birth at home. Most mothers who chose this route found it to be a positive experience. Still, there are a few less than stellar experiences mixed in with the stories I’ve heard, including midwives not showing up for appointments, missing critical warning signs, or relinquishing any responsibility when the parents made a decision that differs from the desire of the midwife.
They succeeded late Wednesday, including the drug fix in a bill to keep doctors from facing steep cuts in Medicare reimbursements. The House, which earlier had addressed the discount issue in a different bill, included the remedy in its Medicare reimbursement measure that passed on Thursday.

Democrats tried to force Republicans into throwing the brakes on the process by backing out of a deal to support a separate piece of legislation moving next year's primary from March to May. Without seven Democrats voting for the primary date switch, the bill can't pass with an emergency clause attached.

Yet for all that, another mark of her tenure so far is that she sometimes finds herself at the fringes of big council votes. That may be because she still plays the role of activist more comfortably than that of legislator, City Hall observers and colleagues say.
Correia (7-4) limited Chicago to four singles and a pair of walks in 7 1-3 innings. He moved into a tie with Boston’s Jon Lester for the major league lead in wins, and has six of the Pirates’ 14 victories away from PNC Park this season.
James will be compared to Modell, although NBA basketball, of sorts, will continue here, and NFL football, the biggest thing in town by far, did not for three years. Of course Modell should have sold to a local buyer, but he was down to his last resort in order to stay in the game when he moved the Browns to ease his financial burdens. James had plenty of time, at age 25, to redeem his feeble efforts against Boston. Garnett, for example, stayed a decade in a less competitive situation in Minnesota and left more honorably.

Most (but by no means all) conservatives I know would have few problems with large-scale immigration if we didn't have a welfare state that bequeaths so many benefits on citizens and non-citizens alike. I myself am a huge fan of legal immigration. But if you try to see things like a state for a second, it's simply unsustainable to have a libertarian immigration policy and a liberal welfare state. Ultimately, if you don't want cops asking for your papers, you need to get rid of one or the other.
Federal and state budgets are burdened by the least-effective health care and education systems among industrialized countries. For example, the German and Dutch private systems spend about 50 percent less per capita and accomplish better outcomes.

"We all know him. We know how committed he is to winning," Smith said. "It's not on him. I look at the one-for-13 on third downs. I know he's going to feel bad, but he's still part of our team. We didn't lose the game there. We lost it across the board offensively. We just couldn't get it done."

In the end, he had to compromise his independence. He made a deal with Metro (or with his father-in-law) whereby he got Gable, plus $1.25 million in funding, and Metro got the right to release the film (for seven years) on a 50-50 split of the profits. Gable was paid a salary of just over $121,000. Later on, when Vivien Leigh was "discovered" for Scarlett, she got $25,000. Both stars got modest bonuses after the film became a great hit. But that's all they got.

Critics said the reservation system, which had been in place for many years, had helped fuel out-of-state litigation, making Madison County home to one-fourth of all asbestos lawsuits filed in the nation. They said select law firms would often market the trial dates to prospective clients throughout the nation. The county has its own asbestos division with a judge dedicated to handling those cases. Proponents said it was a way for dying plaintiffs to efficiently try their cases by getting them into court quickly.

When the Giants desperately needed a big-bodied, big-play receiver that defenses would have to game-plan, they failed to land one in the draft. So they signed Plaxico Burress to fill that gap, and added linebacker Antonio Pierce, a center and an offensive right tackle through free agency -- all key to the 2007 Super Bowl team.

Arguments against each of the practices in questions were made long before anything changed: "Whatever happened when these immoral practices ceased, it wasn't, so it seemed to me, that people were bowled over by new moral arguments.

It began unraveling very quickly. Centrists wanted the administration to concentrate on the economy and jobs, but the White House had other ideas. Once the stimulus package was approved, Obama moved on to the unpopular health care bill and the failed cap-and-trade measure, which later cost many House Democrats their jobs. Obama's approval ratings fell, especially among independents.
Shareholder response to Cedar Fair's pay practices falls into the 50- to 70-percent approval range that GovernanceMetrics deems "maybe" votes, Hodgson said.

Maybe so. But knowing Fisher, I doubt he would mind being mentioned in the same sentence with Hill. The two parallel one another, even in years at their schools. In a relatively short period of time in the NCAA universe, their programs have risen from obscurity to among the top 25 in the country. And it can be argued no two coaches at any level have done better jobs with their respective sports in this town as these men.
But how will the season end? If OSU sweeps the next three series the Beavers will win the Pac-10 and all but lock up a national seed. If they stumble at all and it comes down to them or Arizona State being a national seed, things could get interesting since Arizona State has a higher RPI.

"The Bronx River Parkway is a glaring example of the deficiencies we see on area roadways," said Robert Sinclair, a spokesman for the American Automobile Association.

The on-ramps are too short."

And when Kasich won, he was not without leverage over the casinos -- lots of it. He could have gone back to the ballot to ask for a fair licensing fee of, perhaps, another $100 million per casino. His hand-picked gaming commission has the power to promulgate draconian regulations governing how the casinos operate. And, most important, how the state's commercial activity tax is applied to these four facilities will have an enormous impact on their bottom line.

Interesting comparison. Like Tebow, Douglass was a big (6-4, 225) left-handed quarterback who was better at running than throwing. Like Tebow, he had a pretty strong arm. He averaged 12.8 yards per completion over his career. And like Tebow, Douglass was a pretty successful college quarterback. He led Kansas to the 1969 Orange Bowl and finished seventh in Heisman voting that year before being chosen in the second round by the Bears. Douglass set a record, since broken, for most rushing yards in a season when he ran for 968 yards in 14 games in 1972. He also averaged 6.5 yards per carry over his career. But unless Tebow can pass more successfully than Douglass did, he won't stand a chance. Douglass completed 43 percent of his career passes. His career passer rating was 48.5.

The claim: Only liberals are supporting the fair-districting amendments, Nos. 5 and 6. So goes the argument from Republican incumbents sitting in safe, gerrymandered districts. Here's reality: Both parties are self-serving hypocrites when it comes to gerrymandering. Both do it when they have power and whine about it when they don't. But true fans of good government have decried it all along. In fact, back in 1993, this very newspaper described the Democrats' version of gerrymandering as "a spectacle of self-serving politicians protecting their turf or carving out congressional districts where they could win." The politicians and parties may be inconsistent. But many of those supporting fair districts are not.

The other afternoon, when I ventured into America — actually, I only go out maybe once or twice a week, to 7-Eleven, if I get a hankering for a Slurpee and a Slim Jim — a complete stranger tapped me on the shoulder and asked if things ever would be the way they once were.

The Stoli Sticki is perhaps one of the very few types of vodka I would drink straight up. This honey-flavored vodka is delicate and only slightly sweet with undertones of floral notes and vanilla.
