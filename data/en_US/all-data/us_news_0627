McCoy was the un-Young, much as McCoy's designated successor in Cleveland, 28-year-old Brandon Weeden, is the un-young. Psychologically, the gritty underdog role in which McCoy, a third-round draft pick, was cast fit perfectly in a city suspicious of overdogs, particularly since that messy basketball divorce at The Q.
At the same time, 40 percent of likely voters call themselves tea party supporters, and most of them lean toward Republicans while nearly two-thirds have a deeply negative impression of Democrats. That means the GOP could be in strong shape on Nov. 2 if tea party backers turn out and vote Republican. That's what they've been doing so far this year: The grass-roots, antiestablishment movement can claim wins in at least seven GOP Senate races, a handful of Republican gubernatorial contests and dozens of House primary campaigns.
Which gets to the other story of this week: the president's State of the Mitt Address. Mr. Gingrich might have some Republicans spooked, but Democrats are still hoping for the Massachusetts governor. They, too, have noticed that Mr. Romney is ducking the class-warfare debate, and that not even the Gingrich threat has moved him to engage. They take that as an invitation to make it the central theme of the Obama re-elect. The president's Tuesday speech was a direct assault on Mr. Romney's wealth and tax breaks for "the rich."

The concrete, smooth and cold to the touch, immediately reminded me of coffins and gravestones. I asked one tour guide whether this was intentional. "The architect did not use any symbolism in the design, but intended that each person bring their own interpretation," she said.
Anyway, when I got home I unloaded my car and put the car away in the garage. Then I discovered my coin purse was not in my front pocket. The mind goes crazy...no driver's license, no credit card, no money, no nothing. What to do?
This will be the fifth of as many as 25 regular-season broadcasts affected by the dispute, which stems from increased production fees by Fox Sports Net's addition of 25 games (formerly on KCOP) to its 150-game broadcast schedule this season.
It is a rare foray by Facebook into social engineering from social networking, and one with a potentially profound effect, according to experts in the field of organ donation. They say people declaring on Facebook that they are organ donors could spur others to sign up at motor vehicle departments or online registries.

Once the most conservative of the hip-hop superproducers, West has turned himself into a synth-twiddling, beat-stretching, signal-mutilating madman; rap’s unchallenged studio auteur and a purveyor of provocative sounds. On “808s and Heartbreak,” West stripped modern art-pop down to its iconic rudiments — beats, charismatic personalities, hand-selected melodies, and computer-assisted vocals. Some of the choruses on “808s” were purloined from other pop songs, but West proved himself to be an adept catburglar with a discerning eye that hasn’t deserted him on “Fantasy.” The “Iron Man” refrain is spun into a blues-rock burner, King Crimson’s “21st Century Schizoid Man” becomes a self-diagnosis, “Lost in the World” returns to the digital tribalism of “808s.” Synthesizer arpeggios go haywire, single repeated piano noted hammer away in mournful staccato, monstrous voices bounce from speaker to speaker, and the echoed snare hits on “Hell of a Life” slam like the crashing of a prison gate.
The worst-hit area in California appeared to be Crescent City, where the waves crashed boats with such force that they were crushed and sank. The Associated Press reported that the Coast Guard was searching for a man swept out to sea while taking pictures of the tsunami.

Because if Prop. 86 passes, that's how we'll wind up paying anyway. Research suggests that tobacco consumption declines by 4.5 to 6 percent for every 10 percent increase in cigarette taxes, though the unprecedented magnitude of Prop. 86 could have even harsher effects. Once those health programs begin, it would be politically difficult for legislators to let them die, so they'd have to raid the general fund for future monies.

In style, the Cardinal won't be much different from what they were under Harbaugh, for whom Shaw served as offensive coordinator. They'll still try to run the ball down people's throats to open up things for Luck's play-action passes. They'll still use as many as seven offensive linemen at a time. They'll still try to attack on defense.
And of course there had to be news involving Kevin Slaten, the market's rabble-rousing sports-talk host, and it was threefold. First he settled his wrongful termination suit against KFNS' former owners, who fired him in 2008 after his much-ballyhooed on-air run-in with Cardinals pitching coach Dave Duncan. Then KFNS' new ownership said recently he'll return to the station starting next week, and it later was announced that he'll work with Ashlee Feldman, a 24-year-old former reality TV cast member who has no significant professional broadcasting experience.

Productions of Eugene O'Neill's longest, most ambitious play are as scarce as $100,000 bills, not because anyone doubts the importance of "The Iceman Cometh," but because it is nearly five hours long and calls for a large cast led by a tireless actor who oozes charisma from every pore. That's why "Iceman" has been mounted only four times on Broadway, most recently in 1999, and never for more than a few weeks at a time. Regional revivals are no less rare—this is the first one of any consequence to be mounted in recent memory—and so Mr. Falls's "Iceman" would be worth seeing even if it were merely adequate. It is, in fact, extraordinary, a totally successful staging of a formidably difficult play in which Mr. Lane gives a performance that will stay with you for as long as you live.

A fried green bean appetizer ($6.95) was one of several novelty items on the menu, and the light, crisp and well-seasoned breading would have also worked as a good alternative for the overkill on the oysters.

"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937): It's hard to overstate the importance of this, Walt Disney's first full-length animated feature. The genius starts here, in other words, and the film still holds up. A jealous, evil queen wants to kill Snow White, so she hides with the seven dwarfs, who protect her. It's got everything: a poison apple, Prince Charming and true love's kiss. A genuine classic.

Ohio State University's Asher said he felt it would be "doable" for Sutton to topple Renacci, particularly if the economy rebounds and Obama mounts a strong re-election campaign to top the 2012 political ticket.

Jon Huntsman also appears to be taking a powder on Iowa. He's planning to focus his resources on New Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida. They're open-primary states and Huntsman is gambling that he can attract enough independents -- especially since there won't be a Democratic contest to vie for their attention -- to break from the field. Let's just say it's an interesting theory, and maybe the best one available to him. One recent poll puts him last in the GOP field and another says he's the least-known GOP contender. Huntsman's hoping that by doing well with independents, he can convince Republicans in later primary states that he is their best bet to defeat Obama. Polls indicate that even some very conservative GOP voters may put electability ahead of ideology in 2012.

The Obama administration argument The rationale points to both older and recent precedents in support of its contention that the insurance requirement is within Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce. The government relies on Wickard vs. Filburn, a unanimous 1942 ruling that said a federal quota on wheat production could constitutionally apply even to wheat used on a family farm for consumption on the premises. The U.S. also cites Gonzales vs. Raich, a 6-3 ruling in 2005 that let the federal government prosecute people for locally grown medical marijuana. The government says those two cases show that Congress can regulate local activities, even non-economic ones, when that's necessary to make a broader regulatory system effective.
It wasn't just any tree. It was a large elm tree planted by pioneer George Abernethy or maybe his wife, Anne, along the Willamette River around 1850. There was no McLoughlin Boulevard at the time. In fact, John McLoughlin, after whom the boulevard is named, was still around.

“It’s a big key. Juninho is a very good player,” said Red Bulls midfielder Dax McCarty, who is expected to fill in for Marquez tonight. “He’s fit in very nicely to their midfield. He does all the dirty work. Beckham has a lot of gas left in his tank, but when he can’t make those certain defensive plays, Juninho’s been a good counterpart for him in the middle. It’s a huge loss for them, but on the other side we lost Rafa and Rafa’s service and the good things he does for us.”

5. The Rams would have to give up a draft choice for Tebow. No one is sure what Denver is asking for, and the Broncos won't get what they want.

It's hard to say which joint -- Melt, Happy Dog or B Spot -- wins the contest for the coolest toppings in town. But the fact that diners can now eat hot dogs with kimchee (Happy Dog), grilled cheese with pierogies (Melt) and burgers with fried bologna (B Spot) demonstrates a culinary confidence not seen here since Hector Boiardi stuffed spaghetti into a can. In the case of B Spot, chef Michael Symon's heart-stopping tribute to all things good and greasy, bologna is only the beginning. Toppings also include corned beef, steak, chili, pulled pork and pastrami -- as well as slightly more familiar fried eggs, sauerkraut, blue cheese and coleslaw. For the less daring, there is B Spot's Bacon Cheeseburger ($8), a deeply satisfying and gooey crunch fest of onion, tomato and bacon. The Thin Lizzy ($8) heaps griddled onions, cheddar cheese, mayo and crisp pickles on the 6-ounce patty. Both burgers require paper towels to absorb the juices that will inevitably seep onto your hands and clothes. (A large roll sits on each table.)

Reimold was eventually doubled off second base on Bell's liner, leaving Pineiro's line at three runs allowed over 5 1/3 innings.

While tariff advocates say that protecting a solar manufacturing base is crucial to the nation's energy security, others argue the U.S. has already lost that footrace.

Experts say that behavior profiling, when done correctly, can make flying safer. "If TSA employees are trained and demonstrate that they are aware of how to engage people and then do a good job of engaging travelers in conversation, then travelers should appreciate the new approach," says Rick Shaw, a Washington-based security expert. "However, if TSA employees attempt the behavior detection and engagement with a poor attitude, or act like they are just there to get a paycheck, or act like they are annoyed by travelers -- attitudes I have observed quite often -- then travelers won't be impressed. They won't see the value or feel any safer."

It was, in many ways, a policy breakthrough — transferring the construction and operating risk to a private company and jump-starting a project that would have languished for lack of funds. The Seagirt Agreement required Ports America Chesapeake to construct a 50-foot berth, to improve the terminals facilities and infrastructure, to purchase the larger cranes required to handle the larger containers, and to operate and maintain the site at their expense. The agreement also requires the company to pay the state a share of its revenue, increasing that share as the terminal shipping traffic grows.

Even if it's only for 45 minutes, you need a spell on the water. My plan was to take a boat out from Gansbaai (about 1,500 rand, or about $200; http://www.whitesharkprojects.co.za), about two hours' drive east of Cape Town, climb into a cage and hope to see sharks up close near Dyer Island, a.k.a. Shark Alley. The area is one of the world's best for sighting sharks, either below the surface or breaching, and April-September is said to be peak season, not only for sharks but also for watching Southern right whales from the shore at nearby Hermanus. But as is common in winter, a storm scrubbed that excursion.

TRENTON -- A compromise is emerging that would break a legislative logjam over sweeping pension and benefit reforms for public workers. Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex) said the lower house is amending one of the bills to remove a provision that would allow current workers to leave the pension system and join a 401(k)-style plan before 10 years of service. She said Republican Gov. Chris Christie "is amenable" to the change. The bill had been stalled in the Assembly today after some Democrats raised concerns about its financial impact. After amending the bill, the lower house will have to call an emergency vote requiring a 3/4 majority -- 60 votes -- to pass it. Then it would go back to the Senate tonight for final approval before heading to the governor's desk. Along with the "opt-out" provision, the bill would ban future part-time workers from the system, roll back a 9 percent increase in benefits for future workers put in place earlier this decade and require pensions to be based on one salary. The other two bills -- capping payouts for unused sick time and requiring public workers to contribute to their health benefits -- have already passed the Senate and were expected to pass the Assembly through normal procedures tonight. Christie has said he will sign the bills right away.

And indeed the film, directed by Tom Mattera and David Mazzoni from a screenplay by B. Harrison Smith, is flat and lifeless, not even the odd object promised by its unlikely cast, who play it straight and with little energy. Which is a shame, as there is much in the film's premise — is there anything out there to be scared of? — that feels like the grounds for something more exciting. Though told ostensibly from the perspective of the boy, the story spends far too much time dealing with the family's domestic/custody issues and not nearly enough getting down to being creepy.
"The sequencing of the human genome, for example, has shown that racial differences constitute only a tiny fraction of our genetic makeup, the vast majority of which is shared by all of us," the Dalai Lama writes.

American Mardy Fish lost to Australian qualifier Matthew Ebden in a controversial 6-3, 6-4 third-rounder. Fish, serving at 4-4 and deuce in the second set, dropped a volley short and wide. Just before Ebden lunged to try and return it -- and netted the shot -- Fish let out one of those yells that players do to pump themselves up. The chair umpire ruled that the sound of Fish's voice hindered Ebden's shot and awarded the point to Ebden, who broke serve in the next point and served out the match at love.

The scene is a dinner party, and everybody has a role to play. Jesus is the guest of honor. Lazarus sits at the table with him, while Martha serves the food. Their sister Mary chooses a different form of service. She chooses an encounter with Jesus that is shocking in its intimacy and extravagance. She pours out perfumed oil on his feet and wipes them with her hair. In a word, she anoints him. She is accused of being wasteful and extravagant, but Jesus rebukes her accuser and tells him to "leave her alone." It seems clear from his words that he loves this woman, and that he approves of her strange and reckless act of devotion.

If John Thain can be fired for his incompetence at Merrill Lynch, then Reinharz should be too. And after he is fired, the board should then resign en masse. A board that would vote for such an action is not capable of being trustees of anything. And after the clearance of the greedy, self-serving and stupid crew that has come close to destroying what was once a great university, a new group should be brought in to deal with the mess. Chastened, the university might do well to look back at the values of the visionary Jews who founded the university in 1948, a time when the fate of European Jewry was fresh in everyone's minds, and to the example of Justice Louis Brandeis, after whom the university was named.

The Fishy Chippy ($7), however - two rectangles of fried fish wedged between slaw and tomato on a potato-bread bun - was visibly greasy, as if it hadn't been drained after coming out of the hot oil, and the oiliness resulted in a bit of an off taste in the breading.
In a way, NBC is just too smart for its own good. "30 Rock" has the Emmy count, and the ratings, of a cable show. "The Office" originated in Britain as did "Prime Suspect," which NBC promoted just as if 10 million or 12 million Americans had ever heard of the original, instead of just saying, "Hey, we've got the next super-hot, super-smart 'Police Woman' here and she's played by Maria Bello!

Eat. That is the measure, alas, of the cookery of the region. You can go from Santa Barbara to the border, and you will not strike one place whereyou can get a really distinguished meal. There are, to be sure, the various Biltmores, and in Los Angeles the Ambassador, a restaurant called the Victor Hugo, a hotel called the Town House, and Bernstein's sea-food place. All of them have their points, and the Town House, I must say, really knows how to put a meal together but they suffer from two circumstances. The first is that they can't sell liquor. If you want food and drink at the same meal, you have to go to a speak, and a California speak is so bad that there is nothing to say about it. The other is that they really have nothing to make a distinguished meal with. Meats are obtainable here, and vegetables, the best you can get anywhere; but when it comes to fish, and particularly shellfish, those indispensable embellishments that transform eating into dining, they are simply not to be had. Brother, God hath laid a curse on this Pacific Ocean, and decreed that nothing that comes out of it shall be fit to eat; and anybody who tells you different has simply never fished in another ocean.

Hoiles argued that public schools themselves breed a desire for power: "But that is the natural result of compulsory education.

Valentine takes a swipe at Francona, who now works for ESPN, saying, ‘Remember, you're getting paid over there for saying stuff. You're getting paid over here for doing stuff.' So it's already on, and the fan base now gets to choose between their beloved former manager and their considerably edgier current manager, thus creating the perfect claustrophobic storm in a town already known for them."
