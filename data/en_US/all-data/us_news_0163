And now let me cede the floor to one of the more articulate philosophers the sports world has seen in recent years, former Phils slugger John Kruk. During spring training one year, the story goes, an elderly woman spotted Kruk smoking and went on the attack. "An athlete should set an example," she said, or something like that.
The rich Niobrara shale formation stretching from El Paso County to Wyoming has attracted oil and gas drillers. The process they want to use, hydraulic fracturing, utilizes fluid to break apart shale and rock to release natural gas, and the contaminated fluid is injected back into the ground. Major concerns focus on air and water quality. The explosion of drilling permits — 50,000 wells statewide, increasingly along the Front Range, 200 around the little town of Erie — has anxious residents worried about homes and communities. Weld County, long renowned for its fine agricultural legacy, in 2011 had the most drilling activity in the West.

White also talked about "a guy in a band called Tandy — Mike Ferrio. He just doesn't settle for anything other than the way it needs to be. He has made some of the best music I've ever heard and has never signed with a label. He produces the albums, pays for them by himself and releases them on his own. People like that are pretty inspirational: people that don't try to call attention to themselves, but do great work."

Today, the Giants will face a signal caller with six fourth-quarter comebacks this season, one more than Eli Manning, and career-highs in games played (16), passing yards (3,144) and QB rating (90.7). He has a career low in interceptions per game. He has thrown just five. But like the other quarterbacks who were lucky enough to shed labels ­— two of which played for the 49ers and both of whom Smith knows well ­— he knows there’s only one place to start.

The Cardinals took that lead into the bottom of the ninth with Rzepczynski set to start the inning and Jason Motte warming in the bullpen for his second crack at the Cubs in as many nights.

That galls Walker. He believes that a responsible solution is within reach. The "intellectual framework" is already in place, thanks to the Simpson-Bowles and Domenici-Rivlin commissions and the failed "grand bargain" of Obama and House Speaker John Boehner: Cut spending, including on defense, as the economy recovers. Rework Social Security and Medicare to make them sustainable as boomers retire. Generate more revenue through tax reform that eliminates deductions and lowers rates.

It's impossible to make any sense of this. Overturning a statute is unprecedented? Obama supposedly taught constitutional law, yet there he was, speaking as if he'd never heard of judicial review  practiced by American courts for more than two centuries  while pretending that a bill that barely escaped a Senate filibuster and passed the House by a mere seven votes had drawn a strong majority.

Any tragedy/disaster makes me think if this could have been avoided. The same analysis can lead to the questions "what if ". The repeated internal analysis of "what if" can also lead to despair as we start believing that we should, would and could have avoided the tragedy. Tsunami, earthquakes, mudslides or wild fires leading to immense destruction may test our faith. I have always tried to deal with this issue to see if human "free will" was the cause or it was our "destiny." I think this is one of the most difficult question for any one who follows his/her faith and believes in the concept of free will and destiny. How can the most merciful God let these horrible things happen or " why do bad things happen to good people?"

A: We have set in place a process with regard to the potential repeal of "don't ask, don't tell." And I'm sure you've heard several people who wear the uniform say that it's a decision that really is in the hands of the Congress of the United States. And so what we have done and what I think is so very important is to get through the assessment period, if you will, not just for those who serve but also for our families because our organizations, our services, are much more family-centered than they were when I started. The reason the assessment is important for me – my sailors participating in it and sharing their thoughts, their views, their opinions – is that we have never asked our force what this means to them. We can read that, you know, navies, and you pick a country, have changed the policy and allowed the service of homosexuals. We can look at polls about what the country believes. But the demographic that's in the military is a bit different than the national demographic and it clearly is a different demographic than what may exist in some country in Europe. We are just a different culture. We see things differently. And this is the first opportunity we have had to have this conversation. And it's appropriate that we did not have it before because I don't believe that it's a role of the military for us to say, you know, to all my sailors, "Hey, here's a law. Do you guys like it or not?" That's not what you want in your military. We obey the laws of the land and there's no question in my mind that if this law changes then we will obey the law of the land and our sailors will be professional and they will be considerate and they will treat people with dignity.

The days of proclaiming this franchise "one or two pieces away" have faded. In it's place is this matter-of-fact assessment from Cho:
Simply, the ball was not hitting the turf on Saturday. Even last year, when Brandon Coleman had a breakout spring game scoring two touchdowns, he still managed a few drops. There was none of that this year. Most notably, was the play of senior-to-be Timothy Wright, who hauled in two touchdown passes and looks to not only be fully healed from his 2010 knee injury, but be the main candidate to fit into the Sanu role of go-to-guy in the middle of the field. Coleman again flashed his promise with two deep receptions on the outside including a bomb from Dodd for a touchdown. The lack of dropped passes shows that this a confident unit that has learned from prior experiences. The intense competition for playing time also is keeping these players sharp. Mark Harrison, Quron Pratt and Miles Shuler look to be rounding out this group.
It doesn't matter whether you were born in Brooklyn or Borneo — if you're Jewish you'll probably include honey on your shopping list for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, which begins on the evening of Sept. 28.

Ever since Hirsh hit a long drive to center with "Georgia On My Mind" in the earlier rounds, she has proven herself as the real deal. Last night was another bomb over the wall with a soaring rendition of America's biggest pop star. I obviously have no control over the droves of people watching this show, but I believe Hirsh is in this for the long haul. One thing, though: She looks terribly pained while singing. It is almost hard to watch. Maybe I'll just close my eyes next time.

With just one week to go before the August 2 deadline for raising the nation's debt ceiling, the fault line between House Republicans and President Obama and the Democrats appears to center on whether Congress should allow enough borrowing to cover the government's expenses until early 2013 or whether it should agree to a lesser amount that will force another vote in six months or so. House Speaker John Boehner is the chief proponent of the two-step solution, and he used some pretty harsh words on "Fox News Sunday" to criticize President Obama's opposition to the idea: "I know the president's worried about his next election. But my God, shouldn't he be worried about the country?"

On "Long Walk Home," a very sad song from the "Magic" album, Bruce Springsteen's narrator stops to contemplate the meaning of the American flag. "It means certain things set in stone," sang the Boss, "Who we are, what we'll do, and what we won't."

The tragedy of "Long Walk Home" is that this time is over: The Veterans Hall is shut and businesses are boarded up, the ties that bind have been severed, and the town is cold and unrecognizable to the main character.

Without openly defying Berlin, he is likely to become a rallying point for Europeans (and there are a great many of them) who believe that the eurozone will never solve its crisis without economic growth in other countries besides Germany. “Change in France will allow Europe to shift direction,” he says.

When glamour and beauty are required for a death site, the Golden Gate Bridge can't be topped.

One of the coolest experiences in vintage racing is the opportunity to drive on a track for the first time, and that was the case at both Mt. Tremblant and Road America. You only have one first lap, and I'd be lying if I told you that I didn't look up " in-car" videos of those tracks on YouTube before I got there. But nothing replaces actual track time. Another great thing about vintage racing is the excitement from the fans who watched these cars race "back in the day." At Road America I met a guy who knew more about my car than I did. And he put me in touch with Reventlow, one of the original builders, who now lives in Florida. He sent me some old photos from his scrapbooks, and one of his most interesting stories about the car is how it got the number "45." It came about from hopes of securing sponsorship from Colt 45 Malt Liquor (It never happened.)

The commission, which has lawyers and nonlawyers, does extensive interviews with judges and attorneys in the judicial nominee's area of practice. It seems the electorate should be able to know the degree to which a governor follows these recommendations. Amazingly, the JNE Commission is required to report whether the governor follows its recommendations as to the diversity (gender, ethnicity) of the candidates it recommends but there is no requirement that it track the degree to which the governor follows its recommendations regarding the overall quality of the candidates.

The president said the figure represented the "lowest percentage among UB's schools and colleges."
Last season: Coming off two consecutive trips to AFC title game, coach Rex Ryan's bunch had even bigger plans, but season unraveled early, marked by locker room tension -- particularly between Mark Sanchez and Santonio Holmes. Discord remained hot topic several weeks into offseason. Offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer is gone after failing to get Sanchez to next level, replaced by former Dolphins coach Tony Sparano. Running game, behind shaky offensive line, never got going consistently after Jets first mistakenly focused on passing game. Despite Darrelle Revis having another impressive season and unit finishing fifth overall, Ryan's defense was far from dominant.

This past draft, the Pirates landed righthanded pitchers James Taillon and Stetson Allie. Taillon is billed a lot like Shelby Miller was a year ago, only scouts and publications are higher on his upside. Naturally, it cost to get him. Pittsburgh agreed to a $6.5 million bonus with Taillon -- a franchise record. (Current third baseman Pedro Alvarez received $6.355 million as a the second overall pick in 2008.) Allie got $2.25 million from the Bucs. When you include international signee Luis Heredia, Pittsburgh spent a total of $11.35 million on three amateur pitches. Hey, Oakland spent $10 million this past winter to sign Ben Sheets. The Pirates won't know what they have at the big-league level for a few years, but the return is likely to be more than the Athletics got from Sheets this season.

Backers of the Sound Money Act envision a system in which you could deposit gold and silver coins in a vault and get a debit card tied to their metal value.

As in Moscow, spates of applause broke out between the symphony’s movements, a break in the usual protocol (which, internationally, appears to be coughing as if you’re about to hork up a lung). But Muti said afterward that he interpreted the applause not as a sign of an uncultured audience but rather an indication of their enthusiasm for the performance. After all, he said, in the olden days European audiences not only used to applaud between movements, but the composer also might step up to the stage for a bow during the piece.

Perhaps your most egregious claim is the idea that the Official English movement is anti-immigrant and anti-Hispanic. The goal of the movement is to help boost immigrants and non-English speaking Hispanics to the socioeconomic status of native English speakers by encouraging them to learn English. Learning English leads to a life of better, higher-paying jobs. Removing the crutch of government translations further encourages them to do so.

Atopic dermatitis almost always starts during childhood, but contact dermatitis can first appear at any age. Patients are often diagnosed with atopic eczema during adulthood; however, this is most likely contact dermatitis. Contact dermatitis is curable, which is good news for many undiagnosed patients who continue to use potentially harmful steroids, in both cream and pill form, to treat their "eczema." Contact dermatitis is triggered by substances that cause an allergic reaction in certain people. Examples include:

The defense looked quicker (OLB Cam Collins is going to be a star), the tailback situation began to sort itself out (Ryan McCants will likely go into fall camp as Jacquizz Rodgers’ replacement) and that much-maligned offensive line quietly went about the business of making up for a disappointing 2010.
After making "The Raven" and several upcoming films with serious themes, is Cusack ready for some lighter fare? "It depends on what comes my way," he says candidly.

For this reason, it is important to look at photos of bed bugs and signs of infestations so you know what to look for in your home and when traveling. Often when traveling or going into an infested unit -- dorms, apartments, hotel rooms or private rooms -- bedbugs will crawl into your purse, backpack or luggage and hitchhike home with you. And all they want to do is suck your blood.

Mike Acker: It's kind of unfair to scrutinize Earl Barron too intensely; I mean he appeared in only two games this season. He's a big body, and he has a decent amount of experience in the league, but the vast majority of that experience has been in limited minutes and as a role player, and his size doesn't probably do him any better than third or fourth in the depth chart at either of the post positions. Barron is on top of his Twitter game, making him a kindred spirit of Portland's current bench unit, but I'd be willing to bet we've seen all of Barron's Blazer career.

With most beers "you're taking a relatively bitter liquid and concentrating it," says Garrett Oliver, editor of "The Oxford Companion to Beer" (Oxford University Press, $65) and brewmaster at the Brooklyn Brewery. "Recipes for Guinness stew are going to have, say, a cup and a half of Guinness in a larger volume of liquid, and that's enough to add some really nice flavor, most of it roasted flavor without overwhelming the dish. By the time you're done cooking the stew down, the bitterness is largely gone and you're just left with nice flavors of caramel, a little bit of caramel chocolatey with a roast to it."

A world-class museum in Newark? You better believe it. The Newark Museum is home to 80 galleries of collections, including American, Asian, African and classical. It’s come a long way from the days when it consisted of two galleries at the top of the Newark Public Library; the museum, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2009, now consists of eight buildings. There is a beautiful sculpture garden, a shop and a café. Current exhibitions include "Tsongkhapa: The Life of a Tibetan Visionary" and "Posing Beauty: African American Images from the 1890s to the Present." A must-visit? Don’t take my word for it; Smithsonian Magazine described the museum as "the place where Shangri-la and New Jersey meet … its diverse community and treasures from Tibet to Timbuktu make the Newark Museum a little corner of paradise."

Which brings us to hypersonic. Programs involving first-time technologies have historically been extremely expensive to develop and engineer, and almost as costly to test. Like ballistic missiles in the 1950s and the Strategic Defense Initiative in the ’90s, expect serial failures on the launching pad until the technology is understood, let alone perfected. DARPA’s two earlier test hypersonic vehicles both crashed and burned — though not before the last reached Mach 20, an incredible 20 times the speed of sound.

Those who know the Oscar-winning 1961 film might be confused to find that “Cool” is in the spot of “Gee, Officer Krupke” — and vice versa. Frankly, Hollywood made the right decision.

All political eyes are on Tuesday's primary in Michigan, where a victory by Rick Santorum over Mitt Romney, born and reared there, would plunge the GOP race into chaos.

By the same token, there's a growing perception among artists that Baltimore isn't a tertiary market anymore and that shows here will sell.
