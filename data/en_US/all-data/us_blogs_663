3. Europe is easy - Backpacking in Europe is like taking candy from a baby. Because it’s so developed, the entire continent is very tourist friendly. Sure you’ll have panicky moments and times when you’re lost but, overall, everything there is nicely laid out. There is a well developed train system, hostels are abundant and flights are cheap. All great points, but one of the aspects I like about backpacking is the challenge of it and discovering along the way what you’re really made of. Stepping out of your comfort zone is one of the key experiences of backpacking. Think of it this way, will you get more fulfillment and a sense of accomplishment through a pre-organized tour group or a trip you planned yourself? Not to mention, once you’ve been to other places, when you do go to Europe, it’ll be cake.
Once the adhesive was set (we let it set almost 48 hours...partially because of the trouble the devil outlet gave us, partly due to time) and then we grouted. I really liked the idea of a light gray grout because I like how the last picture above looks with darker spaces between the tiles...but we figured since (a)we're not pros (b) this is our first ever tiling job that white grout would be safer to blend in with the tiles. Had we gotten it done professionally and all the cuts were perfect I definitely would have gone gray on grout.

What have you guys been up to? What have I missed?
So, I'm totally frustrated and bummed out. I've figured out that the leg pain that I've been having is a hip flexor strain. No fun. Not sure what caused it exactly, though it's probably a combination of not stretching well enough before running, poor core strength and going too hard too fast.
I have had to hide them away before the kids scoff them all ha. I'm really pleased as it's only my second attempt even though it did take me forever to ice and decorate them ha.
No. Even though the ANC treat black Africans worse than the ‘evil white Apartheid’ government, Nelson Mandela is not even willing to being a ‘liberation struggle’ debate about these issues, to express his dissent to the ANC elite’s black supremacy domination.
Here’s a video about Yasmin Ahmad’s life and contributions to film making and reporting on social issues in Malaysia.
The temples primarily showcase particular devotion to the Indian gods Shiva (the destroyer but not a negative one), Vishnu (the protector), and also to Buddha. Shiva is mostly the dominant figure as he is considered by the Khmer kings as the protector of their empire.Thus, most temples are dedicated to Shiva and in turn, Shiva is entrusted to ensure the prosperity of the kingdom.

I have been involved in a sort of discussion today. It has been enlightening to see the various opinions and to hear different voices. Thankfully, God’s grace is big enough to encompass us all puny minded individuals. I hope maybe the lyrics to this great song will be beneficial. The song is by Casting Crowns.

Fruit based pies are super easy, and largely can be designed by the person making them. There’s no exact proportions of ingredients, no defined measurements. It’s something that you can make into your own. And like me discover that just about every fruit will taste good in pie.
Music, if it is believed to be powerful in shaping people's attitudes, could be used in a conscious attempt to change or reorient people's attitudes. Does anyone doubt that this is already being done to some extent with, say, advertising and 'entertainment'?
I think I watch too much TV. Or is it the TV I do watch, has the same annoying commercials, I forget which?
Good luck Danny, we are very proud of you!
We are coming to a close with our school year....everything is winding down. We are keeping up with our Proverbs studies and still reading the Economics ~ but thats all. There has been lots of reading going on at our house, since our trip to the library last week. Amy & I are reading some Amish books by Wanda Brunstetter and Will is reading 2 of the Star Wars books. They are also studying the Drivers Manual and hopefully in the next couple of weeks they will both get their learners permit for driving.
From the comments yesterday... Carissa hit the nail on the head when she said about it having a lot to do with our personalities. We all need friends differently. You see. I am a 100% born and bred introvert. I would love for me to grow in my "extrovertiness" side (not a word, word. But I'm using it). I think this is another part of my brewed up, with a side o' vulnerability post yesterday. I see "other" friends - buddy friends - ones attached at the hip. It looks charming. Easy. Comfortable. They're laughing. Giddy. Up close in each other's face...in a good way. It's obvious they're more then good gal friends. They're chums. I love that word, too. (One we never use anymore.)

I want you proud of me, but not at the expense of who I am called to be. I have no regrets about eliminating relationships that are emotionally abusive from family members. I also will have no regrets about telling you that whether you comprehend it or not, your constant spirit of control, pressure and emotional abuse may not end, but it will end our relationship.
City’s home form this season has been nothing short of excellent, having won 16 and drawn just once in their 17 games at the Etihad stadium, with only Sunderland having taken points off them. 51 goals scored and only 10 conceded at home is the best in the entire division on both counts, as is their points tally by some distance.
Owen/Cristina: Since this was the furthest removed from the operating room, let’s get it out of the way. As powerful as the acting is, I feel like we’re in a bit of a rut with these two. The two spend the hour in couple’s counseling, and try and have a tit-for-tat argument over their entire relationship, but it always comes back to the abortion. Regardless of anyone’s opinion on abortion, Cristina has always been perfectly clear that she didn’t want children. She and Owen both act as if the conversation didn’t come up until after the wedding, but I perfectly recall (ok, ABC re-ran the episode this past weekend) that in the season 6 episode “Sympathy For The Parents”, Cristina made her wishes about motherhood quite clear. I feel bad that Owen didn’t remember this when he married her, but Cristina has never wavered on this. He brings up that she only cares about surgery, but again, this has always been Cristina. When he tries to imply that Cristina should have a baby because Meredith does (and the Twisted Sisters do everything together), the fact that neither is the others “person” seems to drive a further wedge. They end their session further apart than ever, on opposite sides of the couch, with the counselor symbolically closing the book on their marriage… I mean… their session.
For those who don’t know, The Avengers is a film that has been years in the making. All of Marvel Studios films following Iron Man have been leading to this story: A tale featuring Earth’s mightiest heroes together at last. In the process of creating a movie with such ambition, many people began to wonder if this could ever work. Fans all over the world were both excited and terrified when the news first came out that this film would happen, but a lot of their concerns were put at ease when they announced the film’s writer/director: Joss Whedon.
Eventually I get them all plugged in.

Happy Friday. I'm going to make h'ors doevres and a cold glass of beer when I get home. It's been a stressful work week-- and I'm sick of hearing budget cuts and potential job cuts in the school districts. I don't want to lose my job, but I'm not going to collapse in fear.

Hope everyone enjoyed this today! I definitely had fun playing with the Glassine paper and the Goosebumps. I'm eventually going to get a hang of this stuff. LOL. Have a safe and happy Thursday and I'll see you all tomorrow!
Oh man...pretty much anything. I'm all about entrees, sides, and salads. But I'm not good with desserts and baking. My favorite thing to prepare for a semi-fancy meal is a seared, high quality tuna steak, a really good salad, and some sort of starchy side. For a simple supper, a good entree salad with tons of fresh ingredients.

Shahrukh Khan got Akon in the studio with composers Vishal and Shekhar for Ra.One‘s and they created “Chammak Challo.” Get Sanjoy Deb behind his laptop and we get a “Chammak Challo Remix” which stopped me in my tracks. The seamless blend of top 40 records and Hindi favorites seemed to good to be true. Thanks to Sanjoy, I can’t listen to the lackluster original edition of “Chammak Challo.”

St. Francis prayer – this little prayer speaks to me. It’s the one about using us instruments of peace – a good solid guideline on how to live a decent life. We can be mean and nasty and angry but what is it going to get you? How much better it is to sow affirming seeds planting the possibility of goodness around you.
And so, I come to tell a different story. Many of my students are first generation college students, and many have challenges in their lives I can barely imagine. Many of them don't know anyone who's read Shakespeare, ever. And many of them come with open hearts, to try to learn, to grow as humans, to see the world in new ways. And they do. They learn and their minds expand and sometimes even when they don't want to they learn to like Shakespeare. This is why I teach, why I try semester in and semester out to motivate students who aren't even sure why they're here.

The author sees a “falseness” in today’s society: “Genocide must be more than six million. Anything less is a traffic violation. I get really nauseous when I hear what is being said to the Syrians.” And with that, he attacks Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle for the argument that intervention would make the situation worse: “It is already a conflagration, a massacre. It was the same at the time of the Holocaust.” No one wanted to intervene.
The objectives of our event are to stimulate discussion, create awareness and provide answers to the following questions: 1) What is groundwater? 2) Why is groundwater so important to us and all living things? 3) What are the human impacts on groundwater for now and the future?

Day 002 – July 24, 2011
Jesus wasn’t concerned about me being a great writer. What He desired (and still desires) is that He has access to every part of my life. The more of myself I surren- dered to Jesus over the years, the more He’s done the work. And through Him I’ve accomplished more that I could ask or even think. Today I have enough books to fill a bookshelf, but more importantly I walk through life depending not on my own strength, but on Jesus who is at work within me.

Pre-cinematic technology takes over HERE for a week of contemporary cantastoria cooked up by puppeteers, artists, and craftspeople from across the country. A millenium-old art form is rejuvenated and re-imagined, as performers animate paintings and banners alongside texts, puppets, jokes, songs and stories.
I'm in Austin. Beautiful glorious Austin. I'm staying at my house, where I have a bed, a tv, stereo, a toaster and a frying pan. Minimal and wonderful. It's amazing how little you need, really, to survive. Granted, the bed is fairly luxurious, but the rest of the house is echoing wood floors and walls that need painting.
Anyway, growing up, my grandparents had a Tangerine tree in their back yard. They lived in the Deep South and couple get away with having one. I remember waiting patiently every winter for the fruit to ripen. One year we got to pluck the fruit straight off the tree and eat it right away. However, sometimes, like we do in Houston, the Deep South will get freaky weather during the winter. The Deep South is not known for frosts but one year a freezing temperatures and frost killed their 30 year old Tangerine tree :-(. I think there was freezing weather several days in a row. There goes one childhood memory.
The message itself, however, cannot be dismissed. We are, in fact, in serious trouble.
The Other Place
He mentions a lot of great examples such as Mozart, Yo-Yo Ma and Michael Jordan as folks who actually had to work to get where they got. He demystified ”genius”. Most people think that most geniuses are born that way. According to Shenk, it’s not the case at all.
Back to the wigs. Taking up monster load wig-making for the first time is taunting. Even to me and I fear it would launch into some half-a-year projects I’m so “fond of”. But I see no problem meddling around with some of those wigs. I should keep the original natural as it is (some Katie’s wigs do look adorable) and play around with the ones they sell separately. Like the wonderful monster length brown wig on Amazon that none of the sellers ship here (mumblemumblemumblerrrrrrrr!), but I’m sure that if I end up using Liv doll for making my first ooak, I will find the way to get either the blond or the brown very lengthy wigs and several at the same time so I can make nice Rapunzel out of her. With poison ivy colored stripes. Now that would be cool looking hairstyle. With few ivy colored braids running over her thick locks… Ok, I have my imagination going.
To finish off there is a nice statistical summary of 2011 by Heather Morrison, Simon Fraser University School of Communication, who calls it ‘the year of open’. It does certainly seem that way: “There are over 7,000 peer-reviewed fully open access journals as listed in the DOAJ, still growing by 4 titles per day“. Noted journals include PLoS ONE, PubMedCentral, arXiv, RePEC, and E-LIS. It seems that there are “over 2,000 repositories, linking to more than 30 million items, growing at the rate of 21 thousand items per day“. For many the open access model is the only way forward and this requires some people to do a lot of rethinking.

Fortunately however Dave Nellist former Labour MP and currently a Socialist Party councillor in Coventry spoke from the platform at both rallies, he made the points which I have made in this article and pointed out that anti-cuts campaigners have had electoral success, in Kidderminster twice winning an MP as well as councillors and councillors won by anti-cuts campaigners in Huddersfield, Wigan, Wallsall and many other places and there is a need to build on this in the next election. This was also made clear in a very good Socialist Party leaflet which to my knowledge was the only material on the day highlighting a real strategy to defeat the cuts which was very will received, after all that was the point of the demonstration was it not?
Working the night shift in an adult assisted living facility my after work routine consisted of sitting around the apartment, reading and gazing at the drawing. The girl looked different from the other Native Americans I’ve seen. Up until that time the only Native Americans I ever saw were the ones on the silver screen. Knowing that the individuals depicted so were Hollywood stereotypes I never took all that I saw with any real credibility. Even so, the Native Americans depicted in the movies were of the American Southwestern region. This charcoal drawing of a young woman looked quite different in her dress than what I saw the actors wearing in the movies. Wanting to know more I decided to visit the library to start my research into what I was seeing.
Have a wonderful week!!!

Also alleging passing off, Allergan sought injunctive relief and damages.
Afterlife would be capricious with an annual or spell (unless afterlife occurs during a movie, afresh it is abiding and irreversible).
Notice the phrase “Yea, though . . .” Even in the midst of our darkest times, the Lord promises He is with us. He does not cause our pain, though at times He does allow it. And the truth remains that we live in a fallen and desperate world. But He remains faithful to the end. Still wondering how I can say that? Well, I have faith and confidence I will see my father again. In fact, I realize in hindsight that God DID save my father. He just didn’t rescue him to stay in this world, and chose instead to claim him for heaven. Horatio pleads with the Lord to “haste the day.” The day will come when our “faith will become sight.” We will see. One day all will make sense. One day every tear shall be wiped away, and every knee shall bow. Praise God! He is good, even when the world is not. If we believe He is Who He says He is, then we must trust Him . . . His timing, His outcome, and His purpose. It is in doing so that we find the beginning of peace, even in the midst of the deepest pain. Yes, it is well with my soul.
Having played Heroes of might and magic for years, I was looking forward to the new game. Not so much because I wanted a new town, or new creatures, I mean Heroes 3 was the perfect game in every way. I skipped the fourth since I could not handle that my hero could be killed in combat- way too much pressure for me- and played the fifth when that arrived. Heroes 5 is a good game, but the maps are too small and a lot of the abilities are useless since you do not get them before you have won the game, because the maps are too small.
The easy and obvious approach is to regard social conservatives as people who regard the way things have been in the social areas as being correct. Naturally, if they claim that such things are good because they are old or traditional, they are committing the classic fallacy of appeal to tradition. If they prefer such things because of their psychology, then this says why they believe what they do, but does nothing to support the correctness of said beliefs. After all, if they just like the old and dislike the new, this does nothing to show that the old is good and the new is bad. It just says something about their mental states. To use the obvious analogy, the fact that I have some preference for music from my college days does not entail that the music of today is inferior or bad. Likewise, the fact that some folks prefer the music of today to the music of that time does not prove that the music of the 1980s is inferior.
There is no room in life for friends that aren't awesome.
In a beautiful and lyric way, the film explores these questions, often without resorting to dialogue, choosing instead to convey its meaning in other ways. There is the scene of the young boy who despises his father, tempted to remove the jack holding up a car, killing his father who is repairing it underneath. There is the scene of forgiveness after the older brother does that which he hates, hurting his brother whom he loves. The passage of time is represented by scenes of waterfalls and cataracts: our time here on earth is but brief. The inclusion of the cosmological scenes underlines how vast creation is and how little space within it we take up.

Because other translations have more literal renderings, Couch believed they are “why it has been necessary for commentators and preachers to spend so much time explaining what the words in the original language mean before the lay reader can understand fully a text of Scripture.”
Yuki tends to just lazy around, and not help out his brother in cleaning the house. They got into such a silly argument, and I must say, the way they argue in such a calm way makes it laughable. When I was younger and me and my brother got into an argument, I took out the claws and we’d fight. We were never really close, but we have our bond to protect each other. Even when we did fight we’d end up playing games or being around each other playing happily. xD It also seems as if Yuta takes all the responsibility in the house and watches over Yuki. He seems (maybe not “seems”) Is very forgetful and needs some type of guidance. He didn’t forget those lightbulbs though!
As far as the current job goes I have really enjoyed my time at the courthouse and really it was the right thing to do at the time. I have made tremendous contacts.

I have made wonderful friends that I hate to leave but it's just not for me. I am good at what I do and what I do is police work not sit around on my expanding butt behind closed doors everyday.
Each episode features two “real” life couples who aren’t having sex for one reason or another. In the pilot, one couple was married with three young children and the other couple had been married longer but without children.

When we have school vacation, or even just a day off from school due to a teacher inservice day or a sick day, it throws off our entire routine. We have our home routine and school day routine, and once we get her involved in the school routine she does get invested in it. The difference is she’s much more emotionally invested in the home routine even if she feels as if she MUST follow through with whatever routine she starts. That’s one benefit of the need for routine when it comes to transitions.
In the meantime, I would be interested to hear any similar tales of eccentric old battle-axes, either past or present, and the pubs they ran.

But beggars can’t be choosy. At least they pay on time. If you don’t like the price you’re gonna get then you have the option to decline the project. And I have been doing that for months now. Funny because they would even call me using agents who first tried to talk to me with American slang. As if I don’t know that they’re Filipinos like me. So I talk to them in my native tongue and has been consistently telling them I’m busy right now. Send me projects next week.

He watched her. Studied her. Inclining his head in the vast dark room he caught the outline of the starshine he had made of her. His snort of amusement had her jumping in her shackles, which made him laugh some more. He wondered who she really was, what she did for a living – whether she was married, had kids. He didn’t think so. He didn’t care. Despite the time he had spent on her, she wasn’t a project. Naomi Allen was just a whim.

But the issue is not going away anytime soon, and eventually a critical mass of awareness about GMOs and the immense damage they are causing to humans and the environment will spur a political and agricultural revolution. So our elected officials had better listen up now and take action before the people decide to take action for them.
The Foreign Office expects the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh to submit themselves to an average of only two incoming state visits a year, so why was it thought necessary to honour Zuma in this way?

This book is all about worms and decomposer's habitat. It has an easy reading and good pictures with some good facts notes in it. The way the contents are exposed is simple and dynamic for kids. Firstly, a definition of habitat is offered but, the whole book will explain how decomposers live on dead organisms and the importance of this for plants and for the environment. It will show different animals and explain main characteristics of them and how they interact with their habitat. Finally, the book invites the readers to make an activity and a section on glossary and resources is provided.

Our Laura managed to find some time in between Uni. studies to bring such a cute little card here - made for a baby boy. Isn't it totally adorable? The Forever Friends bear is so sweet - and terrific Pro Marker colouring too. I love it Laura. I'm just about to leave Laura a comment, as recently I've noticed that only part of a card is showing in her photos - I'm sure it's because you need to choose a smaller size when you post an image Laura - if it hasn't been changed when you hop over girls, just click on the image and the card will appear in full on your screen, I'd hate you to miss some of it! So pleased you like the babies dummies and are finding good use for them Laura :)

Now for the canter - it is challenging. Canter has always been Rogo's favorite gait and one I didn't struggle too much with. He got lengthen and shorten, counter canter, circles, etc. fairly easily and unlike his trot he's always been nicely forward in the canter. However.... this is the area where he's rebelling against the new asks. He's six, he needs to learn to work in a rounder frame and not stick his nose out so far. I'm not talking tucking his nose into his chest - I'm religious about not wanting him behind the vertical. I'm talking about asking him to round and use his hind quarters. It's not like he was completely on his forehand. He couldn't have done the work he did on his forehand, but he does / did canter with his nose stuck waaay out and it's time to ask for roundness. Rogo doesn't think this is a good plan and his reaction is to resist. He'll refuse to pick up the canter, he'll canter on the wrong lead (he's never done this), he won't steer (a circle is out of the question) without REALLY heavy aids that ruin the ride, he'll balk, he'll duck out of the arena, throw in a buck,.... If you've read my posts about backing him you'll recognize this behaviour from that time (minus the buck). It seems to be a reaction to being pushed out of his comfort zone.
Shelley Long was contacted and agreed to do it. But we all really wanted to preserve the surprise. So she was brought in during a rehearsal day and that scene was shot in secrecy. On filming night the joke was that Niles was Frasier’s companion instead of a woman.
The church seems to be very Anglo-Catholic, but I’m not very good at telling these things: the seven windows in the east wall depict the seven sacraments; there are votive candles and Stations of the Cross; a tabernacle above the high altar in the sanctuary; and even a statue of St Joan of Arc!
I am disgusted thinking that some men could be diagnosed with this “disorder” and be excused from their destructive behaivour! I have a vision of men who commit rape being given Prozac instead of jail time and it makes me very nervous.
And yet, it's getting harder for all of us seeking to live just a little beyond the bright lights of that vast amusement park called civilization. Jobs and housing are more limited in Big Sur than ever before, leading to more commuting, and more time spent in mainstream reality.

A YA historical novel based on the true story of teenage sisters catapulted to fame when they claim they can speak to the dead. Celebrity status ultimately drives a wedge between them, when one sister captures the romantic attention of a dashing Arctic explorer who tries to "rescue" her from the family hoax.
America's schools, these great bastians of learning, insist on things being made easier for them to not teach our children by drugging greater and greater numbers, instead of doing the hard work of teaching that was done in the past, that kept us up at #1. You have to wonder if we aren't drugging some of our greatest minds. Genius and "mental disorders" go hand in hand. Seems you can't have one without the other. In the past, some parents created special schools for their children who learned differently. Now, many, many parents pull their kids out of public education and HOMESCHOOL to avoid a lifetime label or drugging.
The truth is that the similarities between the Twilight story and this one are obvious even for a layman’s eye And guess what? Despite immature blunders like very awkward narration style (Those ellipses! Those constant referring to Ana's/ Bella's ‘inner goddess’ ! Those ‘Oh my’s’!!), the fact that the characterization simply lacks any significant depth, this book has been an exceptional publishing success and its writer has earned a staggering amount of money – seven digits, no less. The book also started a hurricane of controversy and criticism and for more than one reason. Now prepare yourself for the first big shock.

Last week, I took him to the ER and I thought at the time that it was mostly stress and depression. Since they didn't find anything too substantial wrong with him and sent him home. He's been up and down emotionally since he chose to give his dog to his friend, Chuck. Each day this week I have not been sure what I was going to come home to. Each night has been a challenge to get him situated in bed. He says he's fine but he's not.
Well, if I'm being terribly honest, it is more of a collaboration of sorts. The universe opens up opportunity, and I work my butt of to take advantage of that opening. In writing, for sure, but also in relationships with other writers.
As a music consultant, I really push the concept of budgeting, organizing and maximizing the savings in the long term so that success and profit can occur sooner. The smart investment planning in the beginning can create savings down the line. Yes it may cost more and you may have to borrow, but it will save you much more in the long run and allow you to see profit much faster.
I’ve got a nice playlist started that’s composed of what I’d consider “throwbacks”: songs I remember from my junior high and high school years that capture the tone of what I want Half-Sized Tiger to be.
Every time you hear of under age children being raped, drugged and boozed up, you can guarantee Muslims are involved, i am sick of our children being molested by this filth called Muslim, they are all peadophiles, and if they can marry a child of six years old, then that just goes to show what filth Islam is.
Contrast: Contrast can also be found in the example of emphasis. Another contrast element that I found was how the subheadings over the specific content areas ie: photos, archives, features are the same size but different in color.

There is a third Flower like a wild flower in The Magus, Alison, the Lover of Nicholas Urfe before his job as Teacher on the Greek Magnate’s Island.

Hankies and hand towels, small pillows and bookmarks proudly came from these days of early handwork. I still have many of my children's beginning stitches, such as this playful kitten pillow. They stir fond memories of family and fireplace, of triumphs and trials, of success and starting overs..those wonderful days of early handwork.
"It's the crisis". A succint comment from Mithu, one of the co-owners of the Marmite Bazar restaurant which sits in a quiet street south of Montmartre. He wanted to explain why I was the only customer so far that lunchtime, but he needn't have worried. "It's much busier in the evening" he explained, "sometimes we don't even open at lunchtimes". I reassured him, telling him that I'd been here before on a Saturday evening and had loved the food and simple atmosphere and had decided simply to enjoy the first warm rays of springtime and make a 15 minute pilgrimage on foot from work.

Last year, it was alleged that Najib wanted to avoid Bersih 2.0 on July 9 by leaving the country. He was due in England for a state visit on July 13 but was prevented from going early by his quick-thinking wife, who knew he would face intense criticism had he done so.

First, a novel about a teenage bean sidhe should have been fascinating, but every few pages flattened me with either an information dump or passionate kissing, which brings me to my next point...There was SO. MUCH. PDA. Every kiss, every hug, every touch was described in excruciating detail (not everything in the novel, like thoughts or scenery, but every-single-little-thing to do with Nash). To the author's credit, Kaylee, while overly passionate, at least didn't venture into inappropriate territory. Lastly, Kaylee and Nash "fell in love" (note the quotation marks) way too fast. The guy talked her down from one little (metaphorical) ledge and she uses that event to justify all of his subsequent actions by reasoning that he must be a good guy since he was nice to her that one time.
Irrespective of what the government may claim, and the small number of re-trials we have seen, this centuries old protection offered by English law was discarded for one purpose, and for one purpose only, and that is to allow the Liberal establishment to have another crack at the white men who are popularly assumed to have murdered black student Stephen Lawrence in a “racially motivated” attack at a bus stop in Eltham, South London in April 1993.

Ice sheets covered the sidewalks making the task of walking harder than it should have been. Belinda barely felt the chill as walked the few blocks down towards the bus stop. The smell from the fresh baked goods, courtesy of the bakery across the street, floated gently on winter winds, wafting around her body and settling into her nostrils. Her stomach rumbled loudly and a passerby stopped to stare at her as he walked by. She could have sworn that you could hear the knots in her stomach form. Belinda hated it when people stared at her. Every time she left the house lately she’d been getting more and more anxious. It felt like more and more people stopped to gawk at her lately. She could feel their eyes upon her skin and it gave her the heebie jeebies. Belinda wished she would have remembered to eat breakfast this morning. Then maybe that stranger wouldn’t be staring at her right now. Forgetting about the stranger and focusing in on her hunger pang, she was absolutely ravenous suddenly. Belinda tried to recall the last time she had ate something and came up blank. She still had five minutes to spare before the bus came. Belinda let her stomach guide her to the closest morsels of food. Following her nose across the street to the bakery while she convinced herself she had the time and wouldn’t miss the bus if she stopped and ate. Soon she found herself sitting in a corner by herself and ignored life for a few moments while she got lost in her coffee and bagel. Her hunger successfully sedated for the time being she felt better. Belinda grabbed up her book bag and slurped down the last drips of coffee before heading back on track to catch the bus.

i'm afraid. i dont want to listen. i don't want to let go of my broken heart. i'm fine with going throughout my day with a smile plastered on my face. everything is ok. i can pretend all day long. i can reach out to others and help them through their greatest needs. i can share Jesus to a dark and dying world. i can live with a God given purpose and do mighty things in His name. i'm fine with all that. really i am. but at the end of the day, when i crawl into bed, i long to go back to that place. to that cold sterile room, with my heart in my arms. where i could touch and feel and smell and see. that he was here, and he was real. he wasn't just a figment of my imagination. he was a part of me. he is a part of me. i never ever want to let that go. even with the ache that fills my heart with the thoughts and memories that flood my head. i need it, i crave it. i welcome the release of tears when they fall. it's like coming up out of the water and finally getting air.

“Vanya, come in. Bronislav.” The static remained. Kostya saw his footsteps that led him to the cave, and traced them back around the large rock formation. Trying again and again to reach his comrades. The static did not let up. He entered into the crystalline grove. The buggy was no where to be seen and the prismatic stones were all gone. Kostya took long, leaping strides and followed the buggy’s tire tracks. They were untouched and appeared fresh. But in Kostya’s mind he knew. On the Moon, there was no wind to change the tracks. Five minutes or five years, they would always appear the same.

The concept of the codex is exploded here in a burst of multidirectional physicality, with the usual single, chronologically regulated trajectory replaced by a series of flaps, each operating as a breach or rupture in the book’s planar field, and containing one of the pieces in this series (constellation?).

A decrepit, old, grey marble building completely sealed off (except for the kicked out window at the basement level of the building where wild animals, homeless wanderers or perhaps even Satanists of some sort can climb in). I carefully walked around the entire building (as it was wild and overgrown), taking a few shots, but for some reason I had a very uneasy feeling while I was here. Something about this building really creeped me out, so I took the shots and then got out of there. On one corner of the building, someone had left a pile of bread for the animals and a pile of spaghetti for whom or what I could only imagine.
I believe that as long as we are living in dunya, there really never is an “end” to our plans or our efforts to achieve our dreams. No matter how many goals we set and make, no matter how big or how small, whether reached or not, there’s also a list more to follow the one (or one million) at hand.

So, NAMA sold some loans. What else is of interest? The transaction again underlines the strength of the property market in prime centralLondonwhich is good news because NAMA is understood to have quite a few loans secured by property there. And whilst it is not yet clear how the Barclays are financing the transaction, the presence of €800m is indeed good news for property generally in central London – although the UK hasn’t suffered the same credit drought as Ireland, the streets aren’t lined with bankers distributing money either. Lastly, in terms of NAMA, it is not yet clear if today’s announcement scuppers previous reporting of sales of loans in the Maybourne Group to Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, 1MDB and to Robert Tchenguiz.

How does this involve me? They want to do a "Before and After" section of the site which shows real life pictures of our current players when they first joined the guild and how they currently are now (the guild itself is about four to five years old by now). There's already some old pictures on the site, including one of mine. Since I was a former player and Guild master they see that as ground to have me included in the before and after shots. But it can't be any old picture, no that would be too easy. Apparently, the guild had some sort of secret meeting when I wasn't around to discuss how I must look for it to contrast the so called "Scary corner Pic". They all voted and I was told by Rove that I need to wear Pigtails.

Two reasons for that a) I almost never get the e-vites. I don’t know if they are going into my spam folder or if they have my email address wrong, but I usually only get them when this friend sends them. When anyone else sends them, she’ll ask me the week before if I’m going, and I never got the email and haven’t read the book yet. b) This friend is the only one I really know so I usually only go when she hosts it, or if we go together because talking with groups of women I don’t know is one of those awkward situations I usually avoid even though I like books.
Honestly, and forgive me if I am attacking a sacred cow, it was the Komen foundation that first put me off. I should admit my prejudice first: I don’t like big things (note my aversion to casinos, amusement parks, and Super Stop and Shop). That foundation is HUGE. And you don’t get that big by just being a bunch of really nice people who want everyone to get better. Maybe that’s a necessary evil.
There might be other reasons you want to self-publish in e-format. For example, publishers always say that short stories don't sell, and so it might be appropriate for a published author of novels to self-publish a collection of their short fiction as an e-book. I am enjoying reading short stories on my Kindle and think they fit the format quite well, so I wish there were more of them.

Regrettably, this has led some to draw conclusions that Christians interested in temperance were almost certain to fail as a group and in the alcohol field because of their focus on “outside” and “political issues.” You might try making this idea fly in the social gospel and social action churches of today—where freedom marches, gay and lesbian controversies, abortion issues, and anti-war slogans occupy a good portion of religion’s time. Yet invariably, the faulty and flawed example of the Washingtonian Movement is dredged up to establish primarily that a religious fellowship like A.A. must not dare to step over the line of “alcoholism only.” The Washingtonian movement was large for a moment; involved for a moment in liquor, temperance, and politics; and then perished “in a moment.” The Washingtonians are past history, not church history.

1. Challenge the “busy is better” culture. Is it somehow “cool” to be stressed out these days? Seriously? Workaholism has that name because it’s viewed as a mental illness, not a prized trait. Be mindful of how often you praise yourself and others for “working so hard” and then, conversely, how often you praise them for being creative, positive, etc.

I’m officially bored again. Yesterday marked the end of my trip to Burlington, Vermont, which also meant saying goodbye to new friends, the adorable downtown area, the big lake (and lake monster named Champ), and bidding adieu to having something to do with my days. I’m pretty much the only one of my friends done with finals, and so now I have to just sit and wait until someone else can declare their college career done too. Sitting and waiting is not a riveting experience.
In therapy, Dr. Lee asks why Britten didn't think Hannah was serious about moving. Britten says that moving to Oregon isn't a realistic option, but Dr. Lee thinks Britten has let confirmation bias cloud his judgment: Hannah has been telling him how serious she is, but Britten hasn't been listening. This, Dr. Lee reminds Britten, is how most marriages end: not with screaming fights, but with two people who gradually drift apart from each other.

The highlight of the day was when I asked Nick if he had any other beers in the pipeline and he said, "Funny you should ask" as he reached down and produced a 22 oz. bottle and proceeded to pour samples for me, DJ Beer and Just Belgian. It was a dark beer and poured with a fairly thin tan head. It had a malty aroma. The big surprise was in the taste. First, I guessed oregano and Nick waived me off. Then I guessed rosemary, and Nick confirmed it had rosemary and sage. Nick explained this beer, "fits perfectly with the style of a Belgian Spiced Porter". Nick's tongue was sitting squarely in his cheek as he said this.
July of next year marks the ninetieth anniversary of the foundation of the Chinese Communist Party. Having last year celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of the foundation of the People’s Republic, yet another jamboree is being planned. I understand that John Woo, the Hong Kong film director, whose Hollywood credits include Broken Arrow and Mission Impossible II, has agreed to make a new blockbuster to mark the occasion. The title is already in place: it’s to be called – wait for it- The Great Exploit of Building the Party. Yes, a guaranteed crowd pleaser.
It has been a solid few weeks. Today's not our first session or sessions off but its the first full day that I feel like I have earned. Some wonderful things have happened over the last few weeks and in particular some of the recent activities have been greatly insightful. A few ergo's and wattbike challenges this last week which made life interesting. Add to this some very good pair rows while our four is separated before our next camp. Then we enjoyed some great time on the bikes. Yesterday finished with 140km with some 6L of fluid consumed with an average of 35km/h with Josh.

The guest host may be the face of any given SNL episode, and he or she may make a big difference in terms of how successful the episode is, but ultimately it is up to the cast and the writers to determine if any particular episode is going to be a classic or not. Hosts on the level of Jon Hamm and Zach Galifianakis can wring a few laughs out of mediocre premises, but it helps if the material is good in the first place. Miley Cyrus was not among the very best hosts of the season, but she was perhaps the luckiest, arriving as she did on a week in which the cast and writers were clearly invigorated. There were essentially no duds in the sketch lineup, and several strong performances were delivered from across the cast: Kenan as apl.de.ap and Raven Symoné, Andy as Taboo, Fred as Richie Inez, Jr., Bobby as Anthony Crispino, Bill as Charlie Sheen, Vanessa as Miley Cyrus, and Taran as Francois.

God prepared the good works which we were to do before we even took a breath. That verse became so comforting to me when I realised that the things that had happened around me were not from pure misfortune.

There is no need to fear for the future or to doubt your circumstances as God has built his will up around you.
I used to want to visit New Orleans simply to see the whole Mardi Gras debacle, but I’m far less interested in that now. Again, I’m very drawn to the food of that area, and it seems like a city that has a ton of culture.

I’d love to be part of the solution.

I've had a few Brodie's beers in bottles now, and they've all been top drawer. And I had a nice afternoon at the William The IV last week, where it struck me that I could get wankered on decent beer for less than a tenner, if I wanted. And it's made me reflect on a recent blog entry by US beer writer Andy Crouch, where he proposes that the 'good old days' of the US scene are happening now, before widespread distribution of popular beers ends as brewers hit capacity walls and re-trench closer to home; how this will open up markets for good quality local beers to fill the gap. He calls it The Great Beer Retreat. Local beer rules.

EDITING NOTES
As for drinking, I used to drink when I went out, but I never really got drunk, other than a few times. But now I don’t drink anymore, simply because of the fact that it’s not good for your health, and your reputation. So yeah, I just don’t do that. In total, when it comes to this, I’m a pretty good guy. I never owned a gun, and never get violent against someone if they don’t deserve it. And I would never ever hit a female. So when it comes to that, I’m an upstanding human being.

I’d like to regain some sort of control over my weekends. This weekend we elected to visit my parents and take Tempest to Legoland Star Wars weekend. Upon arrival it turned out that I was supposed to go on a coach tour of Manchester with my dad (this was cool, I like being with him). We sat on a coach for 1.5 hours whilst the rather daper C.P. Lee pointed out locations that had been in films and regaled us with stories of ‘the time he met Jimmy Hendrix’. I hadn’t heard of any of the films. I was then double booked my dad and C.P. Lee wanted me to see the film attached to the tour whilst my mum wanted me to go to a particular wholefood shop. I went to the film and my dad went to the shop…I don’t know where C.P. Lee went. The film was George Fornby’s first ever talkie which provided an interesting perspective on class representation…

The tile I picked out is pretty dramatic and I'd want it in a big size, like 1' squares, to be even more dramatic. I looked at ones with more white, but I just kept coming back to this pattern with the different shades of blue and touches of black. It just seemed more versatile. Thinkn about it - yellow gingham would sweeten things up, black would add glamor, white would brighten, a random color like coral would make it even more eclectic, etc. Anyway, back to my design.

Another Virginia native, red trillium is a springtime perennial that typically flowers from April to June; the individual flowers can persist for a month. All the trilliums arise from an underground rhizome and have triangular-shaped leaves that whorl around an unbranched stem. As the name implies, the floral parts occur in multiples of three. The deep maroon-red color of this particular flower, along with the beautiful symmetry of the petals, sepals and leaves, make red trillium a visual gem in the forest.

Most cultivars of the tropical, or Chinese, hibiscus are sturdy, erect shrubs that grow several feet tall but are easily maintained in containers. What varies are the flowers, which can be single or double, two to ten inches wide, in shades of white, red, orange, pink, yellow, and bicolor. Some of the colors are almost fluorescent. Hummingbirds regularly visit the single red flowers, and explore other kinds, too.

For food I put together a fruit decoration that also looked like the caterpillar as well. I took bamboo sticks, grapes, strawberries and a watermelon and created a display with caterpillars sticking out of the watermelon. I also printed off some pictures of the caterpillar and taped them to straws and used those as decorations. I put one within all the caterpillars/bamboo sticks of fruit to show that the caterpillar was eating through all the fruit. :) It turned out really cute except next time I will use green grapes to help distinguish more that it’s to signify the caterpillar.

It was as though the universe new that there was something not quite right this morning. Yesterday was not a happy day in the house, and I think that seeped into my bones because when I woke up this morning, I just felt drawn and sad.

Globalism today enjoys a predominance in East Asia that is both monolithic and superficial. Although it has a stronger hold on the elites and on the general population than in the West, this adherence has no deep roots in the underlying culture. In the West, by contrast, globalism has been grafted onto a pre-existing tradition that is much more compatible. There is notably Christianity and its commitment to mission work throughout the world. There is also the emotional heritage of imperialism and colonialism. Although the West lost its colonies more than a half-century ago, many Westerners still feel connected to them and responsible for them.

So I've made a conscious mindset shift, and it's going well. I'm no longer obsessing about following the IM training plan. Of course I'm still working out and (at least the swimming and biking) as if it's my goal, and using the training plan as a guide, but it's become a more fun, less obsessive and desperate, more logical pursuit. My goal is no longer "complete 140.6 in the best shape and best time possible", it's "I will work on becoming stronger, more fit and healthy, and in four months, I will be fit and healthy enough to complete a 140.6 mile triathlon." And I'm feeling much better about everything, even not running. I still love biking. I don't love swimming yet, but I like the master swim group so I'll keep going. Every workout is making me a healthier person, and THAT is a goal that makes me happier than trying to be faster and able to cover a certain distance. And some days NOT working out and NOT running and NOT following the training plan will make me healthier in some way, and I'll do that too. Health is not just physical, peeps.
Chapter 10: Countdown
The only thing dirt poor farmers in Wassalou can count on these days is that the setting sun still ends their day in the fields. When darkness comes, a few will later look into the night sky and ponder their future plans and dreams. Issa worked some of these same fields for over twenty five years, and has reminded them that with enough determination even difficult goals in Mali can be reached. I enjoy listening to Issa’s music, but his past as an illiterate farmer from Korin who refused to give up and ultimately triumphed makes me appreciate the man even more. Issa Bagayogo has reminded us all that through the inspirational power of music, anything is possible.

The gratin was made by layering the blanched nettles into a buttered casserole, then pouring on some hot cream and milk, a generous scratching of fresh nutmeg and then a thick layer of Pecorino Romano.

Rich, creamy, nutty - it was perfect with the meat and potatoes and will be delicious served over pasta as a leftovers lunch.
And Britain is not far behind. The East London Mosque is host to various Islamic haters of the West, whilst being simultaneously linked to the British government which has rolled over and submitted to Islam. In 2004 the East London Mosque allowed Sheikh Abdur-Rahman-al-Sudais, an imam at the Grand Al Haraam Mosque in Mecca, to make the following comment, which was not of course deemed an incitement to racial or religious hatred.

Unqualified nurses are amazing. Without them a ward would not run. People have asked me what use an unqualified nurse is on a ward. They are the most useful member of staff there is. They are the eyes and ears of the ward. They are the ones carrying out observations and the ones on the floor with the patients (not actually on the floor, but on the ward out of the office…). They know what’s going on. They are the ones building un invaluable therapeutic relationships with people, enabling them to feel safe and able to get better on the ward and to be able to trust us nurses.

So today, after a lovely breakfast of pancakes (complete with birthday candles) I got in the car ALONE and drove to Ouray for a night by myself! My first stop was the Ouray hot springs pool. I suited up, set my bag outside by a bench, put my hat upside down on top, tucked my glasses safely inside my hat, and headed into the pool with my goggles. Without the kids I had the freedom to swim, and so I did. I swam through the warm pool, I swam through the hot pool, I swam through the cold pool. I swam laps, I swam circles, I swam on my back looking up at the mountains. As I swam I thought about how the change I most want to manifest in my life this last year of my thirties is to get back in shape.
It was a great time, all went well, we had a few bumps but nothing major.
I agree with Sion. Any terrace will do provided there is an appropriate ratio of sun to shade! I adore the cafés along and around Canal St. Martin, where there is seating outdoors, on rue Cler in the 7th which is (supposed to be) a pedestrian only street, or even my local restaurant Les Petites Indécises which has lovely seating outdoors that lines the perimeter. I see many regulars there, with their coffees, newspapers and computers in the morning, and in the evening it's an awesome spot to have a drink or eat while it's still warm. Good food, good location, nice service. I think that's the winner for me!

To bind the armholes for my sleeveless version, I used the same pattern piece as the neckline but shortened it to the circumference of the armhole. They were attached in the same way as the neck band. I should have shortened them a tiny bit more so they would fit more snugly and reduce some of the gaping.
Ebden made a video recording of a fight at a night club, witnessed by three taxi drivers, in which a premiership football player was involved. He approached News International, which offered him £2,000 for the story if the video could be used. Ebden said he wanted £20,000 and transferred the video to News International. The video turned out to be of poor quality and didn't show the fight clearly. However, News International agreed to pay the £20,000 if the quality of the video could be improved -- payment being dependent on its publication. At this point Ebden now sought £150,000 -- which News International refused to pay -- but the company did advise Ebden not to talk to other newspapers. Following two further meetings between a News International reporter and Ebden, a contract was drafted which did not specify a price but reiterated that payment depended on publication of the video. No agreement was reached regarding payment of £150,000.

But, some may already now sit with questions after the little I’ve written here. What is Mishnah? What is Midrash? What is Pirqey Avot? And so on. Well, in order not to give too long an explanation here, I will attempt to explain briefly about the words mentioned, and then add them to a newly established dictionary, that can be found among the pages. From now on, when I mention new terms or the like, I will explain it in the post mentioned, and then add it to the dictionary (so one doesn’t have to look through the whole blog for explanations).

The Slog’s Bankfurt mole was also on the button about Angela Merkel being debriefed on new Athenian backsliding. Acting on this knowledge, she yesterday warned Greece that its second bail-out might have to be reconsidered if deficit reduction targets were missed. For public consumption, the German Chancellor said “We must now wait to see what the troika finds out” (the Troika-Greece negotiations start again formally today) but the reality is that informally gathered information suggests only a deterioration in the lag between the schedule and the progress achieved so far.

“Oh look, the sun is coming out,” Cassie’s mother said. She stopped primping Sue’s hair and crossed the kitchen to open the curtains over the sink. All morning it had been raining hard with occasional crashes of thunder and bursts of lightning. “It reminds me of the day Sue was born.”
Spirit of creation, attend to us all. Heal our brokenness, comfort our bruised hearts, temper our tongues that we not hurt one another. God is love and love is all-powerful, greater than any hurt or hate or ignorance or shortcoming or even evil thing that we might do, to the earth, to each other, or to ourselves. The love of god is universal, available to us all, not just the ones we deem worthy. Please help me to remember that. Blessed be.
I don't know why it never occurred to me before to spotlight old standby Mexican joints like Lupe's, The Hat and Maryann's in my "Who Goes There?" column. I guess it's because I just take them for granted and never think of them disappearing. Also, all three were newish when I moved to New York. So I don't think of them as old, because to do so would me that I am, uh, old. Oh well. Time to face up to it: Lupe's has been around for 25 years. Here's my column:
Some of the immediate rewards of quitting include:
Writing has been a way of playing truant from the work of the world, or the way the world works. Other than the very occasional book review, I’ve never written anything to commission, certainly not poems or stories, nor do I think I could do so – it would be a job, which is what writing isn’t. Last year I went to a writers’ place on an island in the Baltic where I had nothing to do for a whole month but write, and I came home with a few paragraphs, no more; the rest was walks by the sea, saunas, talking, watching films – in other words, in a situation where I’m supposed to be writing, I play truant even from that.

On March 28th, “A Screwed Up History” (sponsored by the UH Libraries with African American Studies and the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Center for the Arts at UH) brings together scholars, rappers, DJs, and others to tell the story of DJ Screw and Houston hip hop through short presentations and panel discussions. Guests include K-Rino, Willie D, ESG, Lil’ Keke, Z-Ro, Chingo Bling, Paul Wall, and more. This event will take place at the University Center at UH from 10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Seating is limited and advance registration is required!
“Mmmhhhmm.”
But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests? But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.
However. I think I should always wear those glasses and cat ears.
The debate has been around a long time and probably will continue to rage on long after we’re all gone – Is it permissible to ‘borrow’ aspects from other cultures to use as one’s own? Is it okay to adopt the practices of another group in order to fuse them into our own cultural framework? What exactly constitutes cultural appreciation, adaptation, assimilation, and appropriation (or misappropriation) and who decides where the dividing lines are?

Park Hill in Sheffield was another Marxist utopian development. These flats were opened in 1962 and are now listed. They are representative of the “Streets in the Sky” fad. The idea was that of artificial “streets” built outside the front doors of tower block flats. It was envisaged that milk floats would go up in service lifts and on to the ‘streets’, make their deliveries and go back into the service lift and on up to the next floor. (Deliveries were stopped when a child was knocked over and killed by a float.)

The two-week fellowship in Scotland will feature a week at the historic Balvenie distillery, where they will learn more about the traditional crafts of whisky making. They will also have the rare opportunity to work with legendary malt master David Stewart to select whiskies for a very special “Craftsman Edition” of the Balvenie, to launch in 2013. The four runners-up will also each be offered the exclusive chance to exhibit their work to buyers and collectors in New York in the fall at The Balvenie Whisky Den, a pop up space in downtown Manhattan dedicated

And how about “Who ails tongue coddeau, aspace of dumbillsilly?” If one examines it closely, it is French. “Ou est ton cadeau, espece d’imbecile?” or “Where is your gift, you imbecile?” To me, these are lovely words winnowed from the mind of one of the greatest writers in the English language. To others, well, perhaps they are gibberish and maybe they are right to think so, but I have to admit I love anything that anglicises the French language.

When I started going back to the gym, I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do… there’s so many options out there for exercise now! Luckily, I had joined one of those gyms that offered all kinds of classes with almost every kind of workout you could think of. I also got a trainer, because I decided I was going all in. I wanted to do this, and I wanted to do it right. After trying many of the classes, my loves were kick boxing (working in trauma, I REALLY needed a way to get out some aggression, and I thought it was good to have as a fall back, in case anyone decided they saw me as a victim), yoga (super relaxing), and running. Now, it wasn’t immediately that I started to notice the difference; at that point in time I was more concerned that my body hurt everywhere and I was rediscovering and discovering muscles that I hadn’t used in forever or never even knew existed.
Now, because we are getting married in Hilton, KZN, which is close to where his family lives, we figured we’d have the engagement party in Jo’burg, where my family lives. Something fancypants and formal, like finger snacks and bubbly in a gorgeous hotel.

Other options to try are small agricultural holdings. I’m thinking orange groves here in Florida, but any soybean or peanut farmer with 100 acres who doesn’t have the time to control hogs and does may lend an open ear. You’ll face stiff competition from other erstwhile hunters to find these properties, but the key is to network and create contacts.

To illustrate the whole sorry story, not long ago I decided to get the Madness LPs I craved on CD too, and was soon distracted by their nicely-presented Salvo two-disc sets. I’d already splashed out on the Salvo repackages for Slade and The Undertones, and now came this – each Madness album in a natty, Nutty Boys two-disc set, each with a letter on the spine collectively spelling the band’s name. I bought them out of order, having only originally aimed to get the first album, One Step Beyond, plus Keep Moving and Mad Not Mad. But the rest soon followed, right up to the aptly-titled Wonderful, where I found not the last ‘S’ but an exclamation mark instead.
It was just too good to pass up.
Chris heard footsteps coming and the front door opening. A thin, naked man ran to the street, jumped into his car, hurriedly felt the floor for his keys, and sped away. The front door hadn’t closed, and Chris looked at the darkness inside. That’s when he noticed a trail of blood left by the naked man. It wasn’t a lot of blood, not a life-threatening amount, but blood was blood.

I will probably spend time by myself when he is out singing and on tour. He’s going to be really successful, more than American Idol. I can just tell. He has like over 5,000 friends on Facebook and it’s only a matter of time before he hits the big time. Then he will be making CDs and having concerts and I’m not sure I would want to be around that all the time. We will get a small house in Greece. White. With an ocean view. For some reason, I think we’ll have a couple of goats. Isn’t that weird?

I’ve owned a copy of Ordinary People for about a year but have never watched it until today. I have a history with this story, though, despite never having seen it. When I was a junior in college, I was in the theatrical version. I played the jackass from the swim team, the same role that Adam Baldwin has in the film. So I know this story. I have pretty vivid memories of this story, having seen it acted out in front of me every night for a couple of months. When I saw a copy for sale, I bought it because I knew I’d have to watch it eventually. I’d have bought it anyway, just for that small connection to my past.

Do you know anything about it? I don’t care about having a lot of indiscriminate traffic. Rather, I would appreciate corresponding with others who are interested in what interests me, namely, writing, poetry, and epilepsy. A lot of traffic is nice, I guess, but I’m not after numbers.

The theory and ideas of the 26 dimensions are based on two primary things , the first being that during the existence of mankind some people have been to them, whether one or more person have been to them all I do not know, but out of the many that have visited these realms , the number 26 seems to be the most reoccurring number. Secondly renowned men and women in physics and mathematicians throughout history have devised a sound mathematical equation that supports this.
With Thanksgiving just passing, pumpkin beer season is winding down although they still come in handy throughout the holidays. Cigar City's offering pours a deep burnt orange color that produced little to no head. There is a lot of allspice in the aroma with some hints of natural and earthy pumpkin. A decent dose of alcohol hits the nose as well, not something I was too fond of. At first, the allspice kinda takes over with along with a strong vanilla presence. There is definitely pumpkin and cinnamon going on but those flavors are a bit more subtle. The malt profile wasn't all that prominent which is something I think this brew could have benefited from. Herbal hops gave it a bitter finish which was just strange, I prefer my pumpkin ales a bit creamier. This reminded me of Southern Tier's Pumking in a lot of ways actually, not a beer I go gaga for either. Overall it was just a little too sweet for my taste without enough going on to support it. I had heard a lot of really great things before grabbing this bottle but it didn't really do it for me. I swear this will be the last pumpkin Taste Test for a while.

I remember when I was at primary school an old lady came to teach us patch work. I feel comfortable that I am not being ageist in calling her old, because she was old!

Fifth, LinkedIn will be very useful to you after college when you are out in the business world. It will help your career. In the same way that farmers plant seeds months before anyone eats the food, you will need to create, grow and develop your LinkedIn profile and network before there is a direct need of it. An important future use will be to search your extended network (your contacts have contacts who in turn have contacts).
To me, this is just another way to finger point. We all want the same thing. A child in arms. A child to raise and love and nurture and hopefully gaze into their eyes as we die as old people and they are still vivacious and healthy. So why do this to each other? Why are we finding another way to make our choices and our decisions more right than someone elses. We all have our journeys that bring us to adoption. Infertility, child loss, gender specificity, or just wanting to add to our families with the heart of adoption. It should connect us, not drive us further from each other.

In chapter sixteen of his 1992 The Stripping of the Altars: Traditional Religion in England 1400-1580, Duffy opposes a long historiographical tradition by developing a “much more positive assessment of religious achievements” during Mary Tudor’s reign “than was at that time commonly accepted” (ix). His Fires of Faith elaborates upon this theme, revising the traditional account of Marian Catholicism. According to Duffy, the traditional account of Marian religion is bleak. “Until relatively recently,” he writes,

SB 10.88.3: Sri Sukadeva said: Lord Siva is always united with his personal energy, the material nature. Manifesting himself in three features in response to the entreaties of nature’s three modes, he thus embodies the threefold principle of material ego in goodness, passion and ignorance.
Envy is an interesting mix of suspense, romance and story-within-a-story. Maris is a book editor at the family publishing company, married to former author/current business partner Noah. When she receives an intriguing prologue to a book with only vague clues about the author’s identity, she searches for him and finds him on an island off the coast of Georgia. As she untangles the mystery of this reclusive, damaged soul and his mysterious story, her own life in New York becomes more tangled. Mixed in with the story is the author’s book, also titled Envy, the story of two college buddies who yearned to be the next Hemingway.
That is why I've decided to create a ELT Spain page on Facebook. It's a site for any enthusiastic EFL teachers based in Spain (and not only!). I created it as a meeting place - hopefully, it'll become a great sharing and developing centre in the future.
More broadly, I also feel that having just one month-long Me-Made/Self-Stitched challenge in a year will be to the benefit of the challenge itself. It will be more special and I think it will therefore be more fun to be part of. Lots of people in the past have left comments and emails to the effect of 'I'll take part next time', or 'I'll see how much I have to wear for the next one'. That makes it sound a little like a regular bus service that you might get round to using someday! Lots of regular MM/SS challenges could become blog-land background noise, if they haven't already. Not that that really matters. But I think it'll be more exciting for those of us who are interested in taking part if it is more of an event, plus less annoying for those who take no interest in the challenges (whoever the hell they are!!) if they only have to screen their blogroll for one month only!

Yeah, the snow was a real pain in the neck, as well as in the back, but the advantage to all that snow is what is does for the garden. The deep cold stimulates the plant growth process. It's the same thing that professional growers do to "force" flowers to bloom when they want them to. And all that melting snow deeply saturates the ground, giving reawakening plants plenty of fuel for growth. The result? An abundant garden bursting with life.

When sparkling wine is made, it can gain carbonation either from being fermented in a large closed container (tank, cuve close, or Charmat method), or it may be refermented in bottle (the so-called methode Champenoise). While both of these processes make fizzy wine, the methode Champenoise is generally accepted to produce smaller, more persistent bubble than the tank method. That's the science – I don't know exactly why, but I'd guess it's something to do with ratios of gas to liquid, and overall pressures producing a certain style of saturation, but that's only a guess.
Spitting isn’t intended to hurt the body—it can’t. Spitting is intended to degrade the soul, and it does. What were the soldiers doing? Were they not elevating themselves at the expense of another? They felt big by making Christ look small.

Liverpool’s captain, Steven Gerrard has been serving Liverpool for many years in the famous red jersey. He has been one of the most inspirational players on the field and raises the standard of his game according to the magnitude of the match. This game asks him to show his class. If he does so, Chelsea would be left disappointed. He can play behind Suarez and create the much needed assist for the other players playing upfront. Liverpool can count on Gerrard to come up with his ‘A’ class game.

As I noted previously, the humble house cat gives us fundamental clues about female human behaviour. Think of her as woman stripped of overthinking and emotion - she's the essence of feminine...in a soft, seasonal fur coat. Not that I am suggesting women are large upright cats without tails. It's that I see more than coincidence in the commonality of feline and feminine. Plus I love both cats and women.

The dough I purchased came in two wrapped packages already cut to the approximate size I needed for my 13x9x2 inch pan. Some dough comes as one larger package that you’ll need to cut down.

Then thinking how much I would so love to be asked out to eat, surprised by the other’s treat of the meal, and how much I would really like a book from this morning’s speaker. So I looked the book up, checked my balance, was in the process of ordering when I stopped to check with my body instead of my mind. I got this immediate hesitation, darn and I really did want the book. But if I am going to learn to trust me…so I closed the screen and then received an immediate text from my Abe compadre about her having just ordered the book and Kindled it to me, would I like to go to lunch, her birthday treat to me.

You'd be better off buying a bottle of Sainsbury's own brand rosé champagne at £20 or, if you can't bring yourself to pour a bottle of own label for your beloved, take advantage of their current offer on Taittinger which they're selling at £23.32 instead of £34.99. Admittedly not pink but not bad for a grande marque. I'm less keen on Marks and Spencer's offer on Oudinot at £15 instead of £25. I've never liked the Oudinot label that much.

I belong to many suicide prevention pages on Facebook and some grief pages as well. I see much pain pouring out over death and loss and see so many grieving that I just wished I could wave my magic wand and ease all their pain and turmoil. I’ve pondered many times why we as a society deal with death and loss so poorly. I have always viewed death as part of life, it will happen to every one of us at some point, so we all know it’s inevitable. Makes me think why aren’t we then better prepared or equipped to deal with it?

Would that have satisfied the Board that THE LEGEND was being used as a mark?

However, I will attempt to do just that without erupting into passionate babble about how everybody needs to recycle all the time (although, really, it should be that way).
And I needed a script to help me navigate that role. Each time a new conflict or problem arose, I turned to the scripts I'd created in my mind, ahead of time, using them to guide my way.
When I got home that night as my wife served dinner, I held her hand and said, I’ve got something to tell you. She sat down and ate quietly. Again I observed the hurt in her eyes. Suddenly I didn’t know how to open my mouth. But I had to let her know what I was thinking. I want a divorce. I raised the topic calmly. She didn’t seem to be annoyed by my words, instead she asked me softly, why? I avoided her question. This made her angry. She threw away the chopsticks and shouted at me, you are not a man! That night, we didn’t talk to each other. She was weeping. I knew she wanted to find out what had happened to our marriage. But I could hardly give her a satisfactory answer; she had lost my heart to Jane. I didn’t love her anymore. I just pitied her! With a deep sense of guilt, I drafted a divorce agreement which stated that she could own our house, our car, and 30% stake of my company. She glanced at it and then tore it into pieces. The woman who had spent ten years of her life with me had become a stranger. I felt sorry for her wasted time, resources and energy but I could not take back what I had said for I loved Jane so dearly. Finally she cried loudly in front of me, which was what I had expected to see. To me her cry was actually a kind of release. The idea of divorce which had obsessed me for several weeks seemed to be firmer and clearer now. The next day, I came back home very late and found her writing something at the table. I didn’t have supper but went straight to sleep and fell asleep very fast because I was tired after an eventful day with Jane. When I woke up, she was still there at the table writing. I just did not care so I turned over and was asleep again. In the morning she presented her divorce conditions: she didn’t want anything from me, but needed a month’s notice before the divorce. She requested that in that one month we both struggle to live as normal a life as possible. Her reasons were simple: our son had his exams in a month’s time and she didn’t want to disrupt him with our broken marriage.This was agreeable to me. But she had something more, she asked me to recall how I had carried her into out bridal room on our wedding day. She requested that every day for the month’s duration I carry her out of our bedroom to the front door ever morning. I thought she was going crazy. Just to make our last days together bearable I accepted her odd request. I told Jane about my wife’s divorce conditions. . She laughed loudly and thought it was absurd. No matter what tricks she applies, she has to face the divorce, she said scornfully. My wife and I hadn’t had any body contact since my divorce intention was explicitly expressed. So when I carried her out on the first day, we both appeared clumsy. Our son clapped behind us, daddy is holding mommy in his arms. His words brought me a sense of pain. From the bedroom to the sitting room, then to the door, I walked over ten meters with her in my arms. She closed her eyes and said softly; don’t tell our son about the divorce. I nodded, feeling somewhat upset. I put her down outside the door. She went to wait for the bus to work. I drove alone to the office. On the second day, both of us acted much more easily. She leaned on my chest. I could smell the fragrance of her blouse. I realized that I hadn’t looked at this woman carefully for a long time. I realized she was not young any more. There were fine wrinkles on her face, her hair was graying! Our marriage had taken its toll on her. For a minute I wondered what I had done to her. On the fourth day, when I lifted her up, I felt a sense of intimacy returning. This was the woman who had given ten years of her life to me. On the fifth and sixth day, I realized that our sense of intimacy was growing again. I didn’t tell Jane about this. It became easier to carry her as the month slipped by. Perhaps the everyday workout made me stronger. She was choosing what to wear one morning. She tried on quite a few dresses but could not find a suitable one. Then she sighed, all my dresses have grown bigger. i suddenly realized that she had grown so thin, that was the reason why I could carry her more easily. Suddenly it hit me… she had buried so much pain and bitterness in her heart. Subconsciously I reached out and touched her head. Our son came in at the moment and said, Dad, it’ s time to carry mom out. To him, seeing his father carrying his mother out had become an essential part of his life. My wife gestured to our son to come closer and hugged him tightly. I turned my face away because I was afraid I might change my mind at this last minute. I then held her in my arms, walking from the bedroom, through the sitting room, to the hallway. Her hand surrounded my neck softly and naturally. I held her body tightly; it was just like our wedding day. But her much lighter weight made me sad. On the last day, when I held her in my arms I could hardly move a step. Our son had gone to school. I held her tightly and said, I hadn’t noticed that our life lacked intimacy. I drove to office…. jumped out of the car swiftly without locking the door. I was afraid any delay would make me change my mind…I walked upstairs. Jane opened the door and I said to her, Sorry, Jane, I do not want the divorce anymore. She looked at me, astonished, and then touched my forehead. Do you have a fever? She said. I moved her hand off my head. Sorry, Jane, I said, I won’t divorce. My marriage life was boring probably because she and I didn’t value the details of our lives, not because we didn’t love each other anymore. Now I realize that since I carried her into my home on our wedding day I am supposed to hold her until death do us apart. Jane seemed to suddenly wake up. She gave me a loud slap and then slammed the door and burst into tears. I walked downstairs and drove away. At the floral shop on the way, I ordered a bouquet of flowers for my wife. The salesgirl asked me what to write on the card. I smiled and wrote, I’ll carry you out every morning until death do us apart. That evening I arrived home, flowers in my hands, a smile on my face, I ran up stairs, only to find my wife in the bed -dead. My wife had been fighting CANCER for months and I was too busy with Jane to even notice. She knew that she would die soon and she wanted to save me from whatever negative reaction it would have on our son, in case we pushed through with the divorce. —At least, in the eyes of our son—- I’m a loving husband…. THE SMALL DETAILS OF YOUR LIVES ARE WHAT REALLY MATTER IN A RELATIONSHIP. “IT’S NOT” the Mansion or House, the Car, Property, the Money in the bank. These create an environment conducive for happiness but cannot give happiness in themselves. So find time to be your spouse’s friend and do those little things for each other that build intimacy. Do have a real happy marriage! Most of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up… YOU DON'T REALIZE WHAT YOU HAVE UNTIL ITS GONE!!
I know over the past years we have all ranted about many things.
However, more and more, a shift is being made to online retailers of curtain poles. You see, when you purchase bay window curtain rods from a main high street store, you are already paying a premium to cover the costs associated with owning a main high street store in the first place. Large curtain stores and home stores have huge rents to pay, staff to pay, all the costs associated with lighting and running a shop, as well as the problem of limited space. This can mean that not only do you pay more money for your bay window curtain rods but that you also have less choice. There are only so many poles that a shop with limited space can exhibit and this can mean that they often limit their choices available to some of the best sellers. If you are looking for something a little bit different it can be incredibly hard to find it.

I don’t think Lazarus cared what it was: all he knew is that he was alive. Nothing else mattered now that breath filled his lungs again and light flooded his eyes and the warmth of blood once again began flowing through his flesh. Jesus did more than raise Lazarus: he recreated blood, fired synapse’s, pushed breathe into his lungs, and gave Lazarus back his movement. Whatever he did, it brought Lazarus out of the tomb. Whatever it was, Lazarus was glad for it.

Please consider reading the entire Bible from beginning to end and to seek help in understanding the way that both the Old and New Testaments fit together. Thru the Bible with J.

I have purposely avoided using outside commentaries and other writings as I want to stay within direct Biblical quotes.

Mom and I are now digging the colors of the pendant. I wanted to use transparent aqua blue, but thought it would be too overpowering so I used another transparent blue to tone it down (can't remember off the top of my head what color I used). At first I thought it wouldn't work, but once I got to the front side the color started to work for me. I also have a necklace design idea I want to try and make using this pendant. I have to talk to mom and see what she thinks or if she already had an idea she wanted to try.

Most cars these days come equipped with a handle above the passenger side door, which I now affectionately call "the Jesus Bar". I called it by name quite a few times while my face was squashed up against the roof lining as we took the first roundabout on two wheels. Pedestrians scattered, dogs ran up trees and women and children bolted in all directions as we made our way down the street. My partner reassured me that "he had done this before" and I should "relax and enjoy the ride".

-- A couple of the books are tricky to classify, but by my best count, 3 of the books are science fiction, 4 high fantasy, 4 contemporary fantasy, 3 horror, and 2 miscellaneous. (The miscellaneous books are a non-fiction book that looked of interest to readers of horror and dystopian fiction, and a mystery book with an Arthurian setting that we thought would appeal to fantasy readers.)

I debated between three necklaces and already wish I’d bought a second one (I’ll post a pic soon).

If you remember your history, the advertising miners, working deep in the Gobi, exhausted the last known vein of original television advertising ideas in the early years of the 21st century. With the demise of the "Wuzzzzuuuup?!" campaign, the last marginally funny advertisement that even tangentially tied into the product it was selling, fell from memory. The world despaired that it had fallen into a Dark Age.

We were only in Venice for an afternoon (it’s too expensive for college kids, we had to leave), but it was beautiful! The city is so surreal- there are no cars because there are no roads, just canals! We figured out how to use the water taxi (who knew taking a taxi could be so fun?!) and walked along beautiful little streets to our hotel (we found out that it was the last place Casanova stayed before he left Venice- so historical). On the way to the hotel, a gondola man yelled out, “Hello, Spice Girls!” Um, hi? It was a great first welcome into Venice.

I set the ISO to 100 (because the Moon is bright) and raised the shutter speed so the exposure time was as short as possible.

Todays card was for my sons lecturer at University, his wife has just had a baby girl so on Monday my son tells me he wants a card, then late afternoon he tells me its from all 14 students and they all want to sign it.....6 inch card wouldn't be big enough, then he tells me he wants it for the next morning so guess who pulled a late night of crafting, I was inspired by a card that Colette had made on her blog so I though it would be perfect for the baby card. The image is from Crafters Companion coloured in with Prismas, the papers are from Papermania, called New Arrival......thankfully all the students liked it and managed to get all 14 messages onto the back.
The word “conscience” is a New Testament term that describes the aspect of a human being that brings self-awareness… This awareness bears witness to our spirit about what is right or wrong. The dictionary states that conscience is the moral or ethical awareness in one’s conduct, combined with the urge to choose between right and wrong. Conscience works within your spirit… That’s where God put it. The conscience is a God-given capacity to exercise self-critique or self-examination. The conscience is not an outside voice speaking to you… it is an inner voice. The conscience often struggles because it must choose between right and wrong… If we choose wrong, there will be mental anguish and feelings of guilt. The word “conscience” occurs thirty-one times in the New Testament… There are many types of consciences found in the New Testament… I will list just a few…

AND as it always inevitably happens, I blow it.

Truvia Natural Sweetener: I’ve wanted to try this but haven’t because who wants to pay for something you’re not sure you’ll like? I was so pleased to find this in my box so I could try it for free. This sweetener has zero calories (YAY!) and is all natural. This sweetener is not sugar and doesn’t taste like sugar. It sweetens your coffee, tea, etc. with just a very subtle sweetener taste. A little goes a long way! There wasn’t a bad aftertaste like other sweeteners. This is the closest sweetener I’ve found to sugar. If you don’t mind a little bit of a sweetener taste and you only use a small amount of sweetener, I would highly recommend this.

What I want to say: I am not pregnant, though I may look it because I am swollen and full of cysts from a cycle that didn’t work. When I said we were on a break, there is no room for a “Hey you never know it could happen when you least expect it!” I am on a pill to rid myself of those cysts that will prevent pregnancy. Actually, the cysts are so big, I am banned from participating in any “relations” that will get us pregnant. The fact that you are insinuating such a possibility is devastating to me because I know it is not true now or will be true in the near future (unless through immaculate conception).
They sleep together once more with Raoul attempting to convince Mary to run away with him. After Raoul tries to run Paul over with a car, Paul hires Doris the Dominatrix to pose as a variety of people (including an immigration agent and a public health worker) to try to get rid of Raoul by making him believe he is being deported, and by giving him saltpeter pills (which can prohibit males from obtaining an erection). None of these plans work, however, and a drunken Raoul breaks into the Blands’ apartment and threatens to kill Mr. Bland. He informs Paul that he and Mary will be getting married, and then takes Paul into the kitchen so that he and Mary can both kill him together; instead, Mary kills Raoul with the frying pan.

I'm not wondering why my girl, a.k.a-IS (Immune System) left...who wouldn't want to go sit in the sun and drink umbrella drinks, I'm just wondering when she is going to run out of money and head back to me?!?!?
We were at a beautiful place for the sunset on Saturday. We were high up over Seattle looking way down on the other tall buildings. We were all dressed up and enjoying the view. It's nice to be accustomed to getting dressed up now. Alan wore his summer jacket, and I got into some black lace. Earlier, we had washed off the Benz, so that it would look pretty for a twilight spin to the city. O.K. well, Alan washed it off.
First of all, I wouldn’t restrict my advice to young people! Whatever your age, it’s good to have dreams. Learn your craft, set goals, and follow through. Try not to let criticism slow you down too much. Filter the useful from the not-so-much. My personal mantra is: “You can’t please

As for me, I am not sure if it will be enough to keep me reading all the way through the series. I am still afraid that there might be graphic sex in future books which I do not want to read. Also, I am just not sure what else can happen in that town now that the kids seemed to be behaving themselves. Perhaps the story with Cletus and Riley might provide something entertaining but I am not sure about the rest of the characters.

If you read the entire psalm is has a similar feel to Psalm 23, the LORD is my shepherd. The appeal is from a guy who uses the Internet name, Smith – his real name is David Jenkins – Alice going by the name Robin, names which they mostly continue to use in the real world once they finally meet. Smith is not a crank, at least he doesn’t appear to be, he says he’s not terminally ill and despite quoting the Bible he doesn’t come across as a religious nut either. His online profile reveals little though:

He was the only son of the family and he had seven sisters. He did not marry, and after his parents’ death took care of his sisters until they married and left him. Two of them died and he took their children and reared them. In time these nieces and nephews also grew up and left him, and at the age of 63 he found himself quite alone, so he decided to marry.

A caller to the show talks about how damaging fatherlessness is for male and female children, too. She refers to what we can see today in the inner city where fathers in the home have been replaced by checks from the government. Dr. Morse mentions that this is also occurring across all races among the lower income classes in the UK. She is concerned about the damage that can result if men lose their traditional role in society, and in the family.

6 For if a woman be not covered, let her be shorn. But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head. 7 The man indeed ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man. 8 For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man. 9 For the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man. 10 Therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head, because of the angels.

Bad boys = Bad boyfriends. I can understand the appeal, their rebellious nature, their apathetic approach to life, and their lack of basic hygiene. This is all alluring in the isolated scope of high school, where prom and locker gossip is the only truth you adhere to. Bad boys have become a popular staple in teen fiction since the 50’s with James Dean’s rendition of a tormented youth, and there’s been a plethora of imitators ever since.
From the South Mesa TH I went up Towhee and Shadow before descending Fern and Bluestem. Lethargic 49min ascent of SoBo but then I had a snappy 12:10 descent of Fern (summitpost to canyon mouth posts); it's been a reeeeaally long time since I've run down Fern in dry conditions.

The video clip (from James Cameron's movie "Titanic") below shows Isidor and Ida in their bed as their room fills with water. This is fictional and does not line up with eye witness accounts of their demise.

Hartley's body was recovered and he was buried in his hometown in England. More people attended his funeral than there were residents of the small town.

It’s not just the Pakistani men who considered their prey to be beneath contempt. “I think the attitude of the local authorities for many years was that these chaotic girls were not held in very high regard,” explains Simon Danczuk, the MP for Rochdale, choosing his words carefully. “I don’t know if it’s political correctness, but the attitude was, 'These are the life choices the girls are making’.”
“The Murders in the Rue Morgue” begins with a newspaper account of the grisly murders of a mother and daughter. Plot devices such as the locked-room mystery and conflicting eye-witness testimony originate in this tale. In fact, Dorothy L. Sayers claims that the story constitutes “an almost complete manual of detective theory and practice” (1928, 81).
Toastieness can get worse, though Very frequently, I'm told, you'll see people randomly start crying, sometimes mid-sentence, for no particular reason at all. There's plenty of stories of random people walking into the galley, getting a plate of food, sitting down alone at a table . . . and just sitting there for half an hour quietly crying, not touching their food. When lunch is over, they get up, take their untouched plate of food to the garbage, and go back to work.

As the egg tooth pushes against the shell it creates a small hole in the surface and cracks then begin to spread across it. A day or two after making the initial hole in the shell, known as a ‘pip’, the chick starts to move around inside the egg. As the chick turns around the egg tooth presses against the inside of the shell, eventually cutting a line right the way around. Once this is complete the chick is able to break out.

Then, we found seats. Thomas drew a great crowd. Yay, Thomas! I was happy for the dude. Authors can have a bear of a time drawing people to events sometimes.

Last night in fact, I had a MAJOR meltdown because Jim was supposed to come visit me, but his work kept him late and he got stuck in traffic on the way home so it would've been like 9:00 before he made up to the hospital. It was pretty much pointless for him to come up here at that point. We both agreed that he should stay at home, and get a good night's sleep (he has to be able to function at work after all!) but at the same time the situation made me so upset. I had been looking forward to seeing him all day and when that was ripped away from me all I could do was cry. It was awful. :(

Looking at her was like looking right into the sun...I was the mother of a little girl! Born March 8th...her estimated due date. A girl, just as I knew she would be.

And so we come to an end on this, my journey into the much hyped and loved trilogy set to replace Twilight and Harry Potter as the youth franchise. I am glad to have finally read the books, if only because I hate being spoilered for things and the internet was becoming a mine field in that regard. That said, I don’t anticipate ever reading these books again, nor would I recommend them. This will set me apart from the vast majority, but then again, there are millions of Twilight fans, so make of that what you will.

In a large skillet melt butter over low heat until it sizzles. Add leeks, zucchini, carrots, and asparagus tips. Stir with a large spoon to coat in butter. Raise heat slightly to maintain a moderate cooking temperature. Sauté vegetables, stirring occasionally, until they are just tender, but not mushy (about 6 minutes). Some of the leeks will separate into lose rings. Gently stir in lima beans and corn. Raise heat again to bring mixture to a very low simmer. Stir occasionally again until beans and corn are heated through. Remove from heat, add tarragon, salt, and pepper, gently tossing to coat. Taste for and adjust seasoning to your own preference. Serve immediately.

Today myself and Dave were on plot P26 for a few hours again. We made a gate using some old trellis donated from my parents back garden. Dave simply hammered the trellis onto two wooden stakes and the gate was done. It’s a little narrow to fit perfectly between my gate posts so we’ll have to add another piece of wood to it. I realised I forgot to bring hinges though so we’ll just have to hang it next time we get down. I’m thinking I might paint it, give it a bit of personality. I’ve been admiring many of the other plots on site and am amazed at the creativity I’ve seen, especially when it comes to things like gates and fencing.
I don’t know what it is like to not be able to ‘read’ people. Much like commander Troi on Star Trek, I always knew what other people were feeling. I knew if they lied, I knew if they were sad, happy, scary, good, etc. I understood emotion more so that I actually read minds. However, I could do that as well. I spent more time delving into the world of the emotions. I did not always know what was mine and what was theirs, so I had to learn and understand how to work with the energy that is around me.

Although I didn't go to bed exhausted, I woke up in the middle of a dream. From then on, it was mostly downhill.

In fact earlier in the year he achieved his *Duckling* certificate complete with a cute little badge to sew on his trunks.

Before I moved to California from Texas, I used to work at a university. This university had a large state-of-the-art gym, and as a staff member, I was able to buy a membership there every semester. My husband and I would go there three times a week the majority of the time, and sometimes four or five. It had an indoor track, bike machines, ellipticals, treadmills, weights, mats … everything you would need. It also provided a great break in our routine, because it eased the transition from work to going home. Whatever frustration you’d have at 5:00, you would work it out in the gym, have a pleasant drive home, shower, and start your evening.

This is what attracted me to him - his laugh is contagious and he can draw anyone into his world.

We’ll assume that her time is more fortunate than it may well be, and the texts available to her aren’t limited to tabloid-style biographies, press releases by ancient American politicians, and those wretched ghostwritten volumes that ancient American politicians get their flacks to churn out to boost their chances of a presidential nomination. Our historian, let’s say, has a few books that sketch out the crisis of industrial civilization. Here’s a rare manuscript copy of The Limits to Growth, courtesy of a long line of scribes in an ecostery in Vermont; here’s the scholarly find of the last half-century, an almost-complete text of Overshoot by the ancient sage William Catton, which lay forgotten in an abandoned library in the Nebraska desert until shepherds discovered the building half buried in the sands; here’s a volume of texts written by another ancient sage named Sharon Astyk, whose works are all lost but were quoted at length by half a dozen writers of a later century whose writings do survive.

Marie established that radioactivity was an atomic property, and was able to use it as a tool to search for new elements. The Curies managed to identify a distinct and previously unknown radioactive element within the pitchblende. Marie named it “polonium” in honor of her native Poland.

Vertonghen, who turned 25 last month, has progressed through the youth ranks at Ajax and was given the captaincy after Maarten Stekelenburg left the club for AS Roma. He can play as a central defender, left-back and even as a defensive midfielder. If the rumors turn out to be true, Vertonghen signing can prove to be very vital and useful for Arsenal, who have been very unlucky with injuries.

Although an ardent rebel during the Anglo-Boer War, Jan Smuts became a man of Empire and more rabid in his determination to stamp out opposition than Botha ever was. Preller wanted to survive, and publishing Hindon's manuscript was not one of the ways in which to do so.

Here, we see Sooyoung and Lexi (she is 2nd from right), surrounded by the "new" Reg Schrader (left, guitar) and Chris Manfrin (right, drums). Which implies that the band itself was in a transitional state at one point, being a mixture of the old and the new.

I agree with Blutarsky on Bryant and Walker, but I think a good case could be made that Spurrier doesn’t.
He walked to an antique sideboard and poured himself a drink, then took a seat in the only leather upholstered chair in the room. Fletch remained standing, his arms folded across his chest. Compared to what existed beyond his door, Jack’s quarters were downright opulent. Unlike Jack, they actually gave the impression of warmth and sincerity.

5) Jesus is always worth more – In Revelation 5:13 we see every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and in the sea saying, “To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!” If Jesus deserves blessing and honor forever and ever, then anything we are doing to worship and serve Jesus now should be more than it is. Not in an “earning favor with God” sense or a “paying God back” sense, but simply in a “praising him and saying ‘thank you’” sense. Resolutions help push us to do more for our King. Anyone who doesn’t make spiritual goals for himself is a person who does not understand the glory of who Jesus is and what he has done for us.

At Messrs. Reid’s, where there are four mash-tuns, each capable of mashing 160 quarters, the mashing machine in each tun is double, or, in other words, instead of the frame carrying the chain wheel shafts, being merely a radius of the tun, it extends across the whole diameter. By this arrangement the goods are turned over twice during each revolution made by the frame, and the mixing is thus effected more quickly than it otherwise would be. In slow gear the frame makes a complete revolution in fifteeen minutes, whilst in quick gear it completes the circuit in ten minutes, the speed being equivalent to one revolution in five minutes with a single machine. In Messrs. Reid’s machines the rake chains are of wrought iron throughout, and we are informed that the apparatus is found to work very satisfactorily.

So it was a good day for me in both capacities and I did feel, even if from a rather biased perspective, that the children's book world is picking itself up and putting itself back on its feet after the initial shock of the recession.

Like Psycho, there is simply no question that this is first, foremost and completely a horror film. What starts as a seemingly innocent romantic flirtation turns downright frightening as a small coastal California town becomes ground zero for an all-out war on mankind by the area’s bird population. Made well before the current environmental “green” movement, Mother Nature is pissed in this horror classic and she’s not gonna take it anymore. Has there ever been a creepier scene than the end of this film, where the birds perched on every available surface magnanimously provide a brief reprieve from their all-out assault to give the few remaining people an opportunity to give up and get out? If there is, I haven’t seen it.
Whether it's yourself that you're not forgiving, or another person...someone is paying the price.
The Difference
This was meant to be a New Year's Eve post, but we lost our Internet connection in the early evening. When Hubby called about it, he was informed that most of Atlantic Canada was down, as was some of Ontario. That sent him running to his phone to make there was no global catastrophe, and me running to the calendar to make sure that it wasn't 1999.
A new amendment to California’s Health and Safety Code as it relates to vaccinations will take effect this fall for the 2012-2013 school year, and will require all incoming seventh graders, as well as eighth and twelfth graders for the first year, to get a Tdap booster vaccination for pertussis (whooping cough) before being admitted to school. The website of the Marin County School District, which includes the city of San Francisco, literally states “No shot, No School!” in an apparent attempt to strong-arm parents into complying with the new provision.
It was not an easy birth, not an easy journey, but I enjoyed every agonizing, ecstatic moment of it. It began with frustration and disappointment and the end of something that left us dead inside, that would shed old beliefs like skin, from which- like a miracle- new life would emerge.

Without a righteous cause
This verse means a lot to me in this season of our lives. In a way, we feel like our family is in transition. We're relying on God to show us what is next in our life. To our surprise, both of us felt lead to go back to school. For me, it is to help run our side business. And for my husband, it is so he can further his career. As the months go by, I'm sure we'll know more as God reveals His plan for us!

Helen believes that people who suffer from mental health issues often find themselves “isolated” from society. Network Neighbourhoods aims to fight against this and help intergrate service users into society. She also believes that the charity challenge this “learned helplessness” that people can fall victim to.
First, these don't include a discount rate. They assume that paying a dollar today to save a dollar in thirty years makes sense, when clearly it does not. When adjusting for rising energy costs (which makes the payback time shorter) and the discounted value of money (which increases payback time), the time to recover the costs increases to 43 years. Since no school building goes 43 years without changes and improvements, the "green" requirements will never pay for themselves.
(That, and two different people have told me they have found a lot of old beer on Lukas' shelves.)
At the end of 2011, Ally's High School religion teach passed away unexpectantly. Her teacher, Mr. Nielsen, was extremely loved by his students. His fun, sincere and unique way of teaching religion directly attributed to bringing Ally closer to the Lord. He will be greatly missed by everyone at Santa Margarita Catholic High School.

You do NOT love dresses, as you can't crawl in them. You try, and try to do this goofy one-kneed gorilla butt scoot thing, but you get tripped up and don't know what to do. I usually bring a change of clothes and put you in something that actually allows movement after everyone has had a chance to coo over your cuteness. It's kind of a shame because you have a lot of darling summer dresses, but we'll wait on putting them on you until you can walk. (Why are girls' clothes so impractical?!?)

FALLING FOR THE FIREMAN is Allie Pleiter’s most recent contemporary romance. I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know solid, dependable, quiet Chad, and the more bouncy and outgoing Jeannie. Jeannie feels the heights and depths of emotions more than Chad, who kept his life on more of an even keel.
Sue and I have watched all 12 episodes over the past 10 days and it is pretty engrossing. Considering that we have no back story from the first 2 seasons, we had to piece together some of the character development.
Modern-day mirrors are a far cry from those used by our early ancestors but still have the same basic function… to deliver an accurate reflection. Any object having at least one reflective surface can be called a ‘mirror’ and, while most commonly used to aid in one’s personal grooming they have many various other uses too.
“This raises concerns, as she has indicated the cages have not been repaired, and has repeatedly refused to allow animal welfare experts to evaluate if conditions are safe for the animals and sufficient to prevent them from escaping and endangering the community,” the Agriculture Department said.

I hope it’s working. I hope Arla is feeling the pain, and thinking twice about its kiss-the-feet-of-the-Arabs strategy.
1. Rhyming texts are difficult and expensive to translate, and therefore hard to sell into foreign language markets. In Britain co-editions are crucial to the economic viability of picture books (I illustrated a picture book some years back which still isn’t published because it hasn’t gained enough interest abroad, and that was in prose!). This fact alone is enough to generate an automatic rejection. The situation is less acute in the US because the domestic market is so much bigger, but it's still an issue.
Because we live in a democracy (thank god) the way in which we discuss abortion, particularly its relationship to people with disabilities, sets a context for public empathy for persons with disabilities, as well as the public policy and funding of social programs that support the unbearable costs to individuals and families.
Here’s the part I’m not too clear on, though – between these “primaries” and then the bigger “general election,” is every individual server going to have a different outcome as far as who the Warchief is going to be? Because it would be kind of weird story-wise if they don’t have one consistent leader across the whole game…but if it’s going to be standardized and preset, it kind of defeats the purpose of all these world events where it makes it seem like you get to have an effect on who ends up in charge.

Even failures or kitchen disasters of any kind, have taught me several good lessons...although I have to confess, it takes more than a day for me to get over the great sense of disappointment from any failed attempts.
Who the fuck got arrested? What happened? When? Tell me everything! What the fuck do you mean there’s more? Am I fucked? I’m fucked aren’t I?! Are the cops after me? Did they come by the house? Fuck! fuck! fuck!!… did you tell them anything? Shit. I knew I shouldn’t have left rehab. Fuck! Drive faster will ya! I need to get the fuck home right now! Where’s my phone? I’m getting the fuck outta here! Go around this guy! Can you fucking drive kid!? (I yelled to an innocent driver out of my passenger window). Fuck! Babe, how did this happen? Do you think I’m fucked? I can’t go to fucking jail! I’m alright, right?– I stopped. They’ve got nothing on me. What the fuck is up with this fucking phone like?! (as I started to slam my phone repeatedly on my dashboard as if that would help the situation). Why doesn’t my fucking password work!? Fuck it! (as I throw my phone off my windshield in disgust). Give me your phone! Where is it? I need to get in touch with so and so…fuck! I don’t know his number! Why is my fucking phone locked!? (as I throw her phone the same way I threw mine). This isn’t happening right now. I’m going to lose it. This is why I fucking sniff pills…for times like these! I’m fucking going to jail? fuck. my. life….worst day ever……………… and so forth.

Freemason and occultist Aleister Crowley practiced such Kabbalah and likewise connected the number 111 with the number 6, which he described as the greatest number of the Sun or sun god. He employed the magic square in rituals to make contact with a spirit described in The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, a work from the 1600s or 1700s that involves evocation of demons. In Book Four of the magic text, a set of magical word-square talismans provides for the magician’s Holy Guardian Angel who appears and reveals occult secrets for calling forth and gaining control over the twelve underworld authorities including Lucifer, Satan, Leviathan, and Belial. In addition to Crowley, the most influential founding father and Freemason, Benjamin Franklin, not only used such magic squares, but according to his own biography and numerous other authoritative sources even created magic squares and circles for use by himself and his brethren. Yet the gentle appearance and keen astuteness of America’s most famous bespeckled Freemason might have hidden an even darker history than the story told by those magic squares, which his strong, deft hands once held. Award-winning filmmaker Christian J. Pinto explains:
The beauty of having an all-out war between Heaven and Hell is that both are populated by immortals, so they’re going to be fighting for a very, very long time.
Electric universe proponent David Talbott takes up the Comet Elenin question from a vantage point generally ignored by both the scientific mainstream and the Internet popularizers of Doomsday speculations.

Aidan had to have an EEG, but the results came back normal. I remember having to hold him down for over an hour as they carefully marked his head with a red marker. They had to measure out the spots for the electrodes exactly so that his readings would be accurate.

However, when I discovered you could juice things like kale, I was sold. Here was a way to increase the number of dark leafy greens I took in, even if I was running around all day away from my kitchen. Plus, I still have visions of the piles of kale from last summer’s CSA in the fridge, and not a clue as to how I was going to cook it all before it became compost fodder!

For a long time, I marveled at the fact that I pay more to send him to a public kindergarten than students in this province pay for a year of university. And now, for the first time, I’m starting to think that’s money well-spent.

But it’s not just technology that keeps us connected. It’s the bond that we create with the ones that we love that allows us to feel their joy and their pain even when we’re worlds apart. It’s the shared experiences and memories that keep them in our hearts always.
He carried her to the shower and they washed each other silently, sweetly, his soapy, kneading hands on her welted flesh a lovely sting that made her smile in the deepest contentment. She lay in her bed where he tucked her after the shower, licking at the last sweet kiss he placed on her lips before leaving. She giggled quietly as sleep claimed her, the last thought through her mind …. And this little piggy stayed home.
Mine too.
He'd also been busted in California for burglary, in Oregon for resisting arrest and in Utah for pot possession.

Okay… So… These movies were super fun. I enjoyed both of them while I watched (especially Mission Impossible), and they were both pretty stunning to look at. So… why not in the DVD category? They suffered from the same disease…. The central conceit/ mystery was a little too convoluted for me. I left thinking that something didn’t sit right. I don’t generally have a hard time following espionage plots, but the one in Sherlock Holmes was almost impossible. I did have a hard time believing that Moriarty, with his vast intellect, would be so consumed with something so pedestrian as war racketeering. And in MI… how many times is “Global Nuclear War” going to be the goal of someone in a big spy movie? How is this a reasonable goal? Anarchy is interesting, sort of, but the odds of death are far too high for the villain to truly want to blow everything up.

Don't worry, this post has nothing to do with scary dreams or screams like the song of the day, I just heard it on the radio this morning and it fit the theme, so I went with it. Today we are taking a trip back to the awesome 80s and I am going to introduce you to some of my favorite toys from my childhood. So hop into the DeLorean, put your Wayfarers on, sing along to my Wham! cassette, and let's go back to the future.

It’s wonderful that Amanda is organized enough to plan this out. Every weekend from here until September has a designated task to accomplish to allow for smooth and gradual preparation for departure. My curse, however, is wanting to be sure we have exactly what we need with us when we go. I guess it’s the Eagle Scout in me, wanting to be prepared for any circumstance. I’m gonna need to get over that. But at the risk of losing your attention, I’ll save that for another post. Hugs!
