One of the funniest moments had to be after a fan gave John gingerbread man cookies with the ‘men’ wearing a red shirt; Amber & Maureen teased they would share a cookie, breaking off a head & leg, & hope they weren’t poisonous. Amber was quiet for a little after with her comeback being, “Hm, I am feeling whoozy after eating head”–the entire crowd was silent for a second, then roared for minutes in laughter, I nearly cried I was cracking up so hard!

Me and real life don’t quite get along that well. People speak a strange language I don’t understand. Friends my age are royally evolving while I’m standing at the same pace since last I am aware of it. Nevertheless, they never fail to ask, seek and preach. And the more they do the more I feel like an outcast.
She saw me struggling with these kids. Everybody thinks Hannah’s so sweet, so good; running up in the church every time the doors open; all up in the preacher’s face crying and carrying on. Like I said, that praying, crying, testifying woman aint never tried to help me one bit. She couldn’t lift up holy hands to help me change a Pamper?

There was no magic font of creativity that bestowed creative super powers on the people who lived there. There were just alot of already talented people who happened to congregate in a place where they could escape prohibition and censorship.
It's easy to understand why. When it comes to value for money, vacation rentals including self catering options, they are small and more private space to yourself also makes it possible to spend as much as it would take for your transportation and sightseeing. You will have to worry about people partying or other disturbances around your own kitchen. You never have to make dinner, appetizers, or a bachelor apartment, these agencies will help lessen your travel fare. A rental car is included in some villas, although this may jack up the riviera vacation rentals a deposit of 25 - 50% is required to reserve the bend vacation rentals with the narragansett vacation rentals on the riviera vacation rentals it takes to get scammed or waste money on the vacation rentals coronado.

Consider making a down-payment on your own meals at home as a bonding experience in your property for a villa holiday.

We are very pleased to finally reveal the all new Power Quest line-up. A farewell to members Alessio Garavello, Andrea Martongelli and Francesco Tresca was given at Saturday’s final show @ Metalfest UK in Dudley. The band’s finally performance took the Metalfest crowd by storm as they tore through a blistering set of Power Quest classics. Power Quest is now facing the biggest change in band history since they started in 2001.
My mom says that the same pressure to be white can be seen in other industries as well. A saleslady needs to be presentable, which means she has to be white, so she has to put on lots of makeup or invest her meager salary on whitening creams.

Since I began this blog several months ago, I’ve had the chance to explore issues of conscious creation and spirituality. To do that, I’ve had to rely on synthesizing years of understanding on a variety of topics and explain them through my own experience. The process of writing about these topics has forced me to really dig deep into my own understanding and prove to myself and others that I know what I’m talking about.

What did the subjects see when shown those incongruous cards? They did not see the incongruous cards, but normal playing cards — the cards they were expecting to see, without noticing the incongruity. For example, when shown a black six of hearts, they might call out simply “six of hearts” or “six of spades” — neither of which was correct. The subjects didn’t misunderstand or misinterpret anything — they actually misperceived something according to the paradigm in which they were operating — in this case, “the playing card paradigm,” comprising everything they already knew (wrongly) about the cards they were looking at.

Nas often raps about life on the street -- his songs have an authenticity and nitty-grittiness that sets them apart from hip-hop poseurs. (Some MCs seem to have learned everything they know about guns and drugs from the movies. Nas's tracks often have a cinematic quality, but are more like documentary shot with a handheld camera than Scarface or New Jack City.)
We had that sweet proverb on Anna's welcome/adoption announcement. It is suited well for this post.
The Deans, and Residentaries shall see that there be no other form observed in singing, or saying prayers, or in the administration of the Sacraments, but only that which is set forth, and prescribed in the book of Common Prayers: neither shall they suffer any stranger to preach unto the people, except the Queen’s Majesty, or the Archbishop of the same Province, or the Bishop of the same Diocese, have granted him license thereunto. And if such a Preacher so allowed, either by the Queen’s Majesty, or by the Archbishop, or Bishop, shall in his sermon publish any doctrine either strange, wicked, or disagreeable with the word of God: or with the Articles of our Religion, agreed upon in the Convocation house (which no doubt are consonant to the Scriptures) or with the book of Common Prayers: the Dean, or the Residents shall as soon as may be, give notice of the same to the Bishop by their letters, subscribed also with some of their hands which heard him preach: that he may determine on the matter, as he shall see good.
I too believe God is in this. The scriptures say that God will judge FIRST the household of God. And although VOM did not claim to be a church per se, it did profess to be a ministry based on the concept of doing the work of Jesus Christ. However, what I have noticed is that VOM has taken on certain aspects of an overly large corporation, and that being the case, there is always a danger for the those at the top, in leadership, to not receive personal, spiritual accountability and spiritual guidance from godly wise men.
Mohinga is informally known as the national dish of Burma, eaten at street side stalls throughout the day but most often as breakfast. Our bowl of mohinga came with a side dish of chilli flakes but we found the soup incredibly spicy already. The broth is made using chickpea flour, garlic, onions, lemongrass, fish sauce and ginger. Buried beneath the thick and hearty soup we found chunks of fish, slices of fish cake, a boiled egg and ribbons of rice noodles.

WHY: I’d been on an art binge! I was drawing and Photoshoping and photographing all over the place…painting was next! I was on creative overdrive at the time…pencils, brushes, charcoals, paint, files flinging everywhere! Art glutton, outta control! It was goodtimes. That’s one reason why I created this piece; it was another creative outlet. Another reason was work I saw by an abstract artist named Qin Feng (check out a link to his site under “Artists” on the sidebar). WOW! I mean, this man is dynamic with the seemingly most serene techniques! If I was gonna get more into abstract art, this was the way to be inspired-visually aggressive, harmonious, beautiful art. Less time-consuming than subjective art, NON-subjective art is so freeing! Like wind in your brush! Kinda…

It’ll be interesting to see how the series progresses, I know I’ll be watching out of curiosity, but like Skins there is certainly evident a decline in quality which will ultimately lead me away from the series eventually, wondering what if and re-watching series one and two. I feel a little angry that Nathan left, I mean it was obvious as he was probably the most talented actor out of the cast, and it was also obvious that at his age when lots of money gets offered your way you don’t tell it to do one, instead you suckle at the bulging milky teat that the American film industry has to offer.
I've coloured her with my Promarkers and set the image in the centre of a layer cut with a nestie, stamped with a matching shaped background image, which I heat embossed with some WOW!

The Man and I have a pretty chill weekend. We are taking an Emergency First Aid CPR/AED course tomorrow. We both figured it was about time we did it. I took the Babysitter’s Course when I was 12, and the Farm First Aid in Grade 7 or 8. It’s a good idea to get actual certification. We just went online to Canadian Red Cross, and found a course in our area.

These last several months have gotten to me. My brother being diagnosed with inoperable cancer, the selling of my parents things, then their house. The pain has gotten the best of me. Sometimes, I wonder when I will feel whole again. Selling of their house, and knowing I will never see it again has opened up a lot of the wounds that I tried to have hide.

In Barnet we have also lost SNT police, thanks to Tory Mayor Boris Johnson demanding that cuts be made - five sergeants, to be exact. It is rumoured that more cuts are on their way. This may inconvenience any Tory councillors subject to burglaries, but Mrs Angry is sure that they will not be able to see their own experiences connected in anyway to the policies they support.

When I was a student at Ohio Northern University, I lived on the west end of a large open space on campus. I could see the sunrise (or a moment or two after, because of buildings and trees in the distance). I once had a horrific dream where I saw the sun rise, on which was emblazoned a black swastika. In the midst of the Red menace when I went there, that would have seemed ridiculous; but it convinced me then that Fascism would be a greater threat to this country than Communism ever was.

I guess it doesn’t matter. Life on earth is fucking barbaric. Centuries of war, suffering, murder, loss– it’s in our blood, the DNA of every cell. Maybe I have a frayed strand in my heart that wicks up these memories, and when I wake it casts a little flicker, and in that brief moment before the darkness recedes, I can hold vigil between two worlds, remembering enough for everyone. Or maybe for no one. Maybe just for me.

The reader, knowing his or her own experiences and knowing the covenant between writer and reader through a shared language, knows not all is well and that she is not fine for whatever reason. Although it seems romantic, the act of writing is to some degree an act of exile, because to write is to set aside time outside of society and to assert an interpretation. To communicate something. Is writing, therefore, an antisocial act or an act of ego? If so, then all writing is inherently political.
One of my most indelible early memories is of participating in a near-drowning incident when I was 8 years old. This was in a lake, near the shore, in water less than three feet deep. A life jacket somehow ensnared my legs, suspending them near the surface and trapping my head under water. Before losing consciousness I saw spidery patterns of light rippling over the sand a few inches from my face, an image that lodged itself with vivid permanence in the inner recesses of my brain.
No list would be complete without the most iconic companion featuring on it and let's face it - Sarah Jane Smith is a bloody icon. This woman has seen most of the Doctors incarnations, has fought many a monster whilst travelling with the Time Lord and with her own team in Bannerman Road. Elisabeth Sladen may sadly no longer be with us but her iconic character will long live in people's hearts.
For now though, I'm off to get more stuff done, and I think Liam and I will be making a donation run later on. I think that is my favorite part of this process, seeing the things we no longer need, love, or want leave the house never to return.

On my final afternoon in Bratislava, Robert took my to his uncle’s cafe. It was the thursday before Good Friday. On this day in Slovakian tradition, one must eat green vegetables in commemoration of the Last Supper. The cook of the cafe gave me a plate of spinach and potatoes Slovak style. While we ate, Robert served as translator and there was a whole conversation about all sorts of stuff from politics to traditions.
No doubt, this whole thing stinks, don't get me wrong, but I must choose to be grateful. Our pastor challenged us with the following: For every complaint you spout off, or for every request you make of God, give thanks for two things. I do want gratitude, not entitlement to be my lifestyle.

The quirky dysfunctional family / road trip set up had me nervous at first, but this book really pulled me in. Telling the entire story from the perspective of a blind character was a risk, but Nodine pulls it off and the result is rewarding. Rarely do we have a book where we really don't know what any of the characters or locations look like, but we know how their footsteps sound and the smell of their perfume, or exactly the way their skin feels. The climactic scene in the hurricane is made even more harrowing because we can't see it, and characterizations and actions open up to the reader in unexpected ways when our primary sense is taken out of the narrative.

One must require from each one the duty which each one can perform. Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable.

In the classroom, we have been doing an author study of Phoebe Gilman’s Jillian Jiggs books, and the children have now enjoyed five in this series. We may take a bit of a break from the author study to enjoy some Christmas favorites! In our numeracy block, we have been learning to count the number of objects in sets of 5, as well as create sets of 5. The children are also applying their understanding of numeral formation to label a set of 5.

Another deficiency associated with the pro- and anti- posturing is that it prevents people from putting forward serious proposals for the regulation of enhancement technologies. Most participants are content to defend their position and leave it at that. But since developments in enhancement technologies continue apace, it’s necessary to engage with the reality of enhancement, in all its complexity, and to put in place a regulatory framework for guiding the “enhancement enterprise” (as Buchanan describes it).

Two months into its San Diego launch, DOGTV has 6,500 likes on Facebook and a growing number of human fans.

The complaint starts off with the general averments that the Philippine archipelago of 7,100 islands has a land area of thirty million (30,000,000) hectares and is endowed with rich, lush and verdant rainforests in which varied, rare and unique species of flora and fauna may be found; these rainforests contain a genetic, biological and chemical pool which is irreplaceable; they are also the habitat of indigenous Philippine cultures which have existed, endured and flourished since time immemorial; scientific evidence reveals that in order to maintain a balanced and healthful ecology, the country’s land area should be utilized on the basis of a ratio of fifty-four per cent (54%) for forest cover and forty-six per cent (46%) for agricultural, residential, industrial, commercial and other uses; the distortion and disturbance of this balance as a consequence of deforestation have resulted in a host of environmental tragedies, such as (a) water shortages resulting from drying up of the water table, otherwise known as the “aquifer,” as well as of rivers, brooks and streams, (b) salinization of the water table as a result of the intrusion therein of salt water, incontrovertible examples of which may be found in the island of Cebu and the Municipality of Bacoor, Cavite, (c) massive erosion and the consequential loss of soil fertility and agricultural productivity, with the volume of soil eroded estimated at one billion (1,000,000,000) cubic meters per annum — approximately the size of the entire island of Catanduanes, (d) the endangering and extinction of the country’s unique, rare and varied flora and fauna, (e) the disturbance and dislocation of cultural communities, including the disappearance of the Filipino’s indigenous cultures, (f) the siltation of rivers and seabeds and consequential destruction of corals and other aquatic life leading to a critical reduction in marine resource productivity, (g) recurrent spells of drought as is presently experienced by the entire country, (h) increasing velocity of typhoon winds which result from the absence of windbreakers, (i) the floodings of lowlands and agricultural plains arising from the absence of the absorbent mechanism of forests, (j) the siltation and shortening of the lifespan of multi-billion peso dams constructed and operated for the purpose of supplying water for domestic uses, irrigation and the generation of electric power, and (k) the reduction of the earth’s capacity to process carbon dioxide gases which has led to perplexing and catastrophic climatic changes such as the phenomenon of global warming, otherwise known as the “greenhouse effect.”

I should exercise this summer, no, starting this summer.
You need to set time aside for important things, and be able to look back and evaluate how you spent your time. It is vitally important you set aside time to exercise, and even record your diet or your weight, but it is essential for the health of our soul that we spend time with our Heavenly Father each day. It’s a great resource to look back over what He has taught you, how He has helped and grown you, and what verses His Spirit has highlighted to encourage or challenge you.

Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there. When the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous signs he did, they all paid close attention to what he said. With shrieks, evil spirits came out of many, and many paralytics and cripples were healed. So there was great joy in that city (Acts 8:5-8).
CV: Naw, it's just a sad fact. I am a documentary artist, so I just have facts to show. The North American Free Trade Agreement meant that Maytag could make their fridges about 10 feet across the Mexican border, and make so much more money, because the people in Mexico will work for a lot less money, and the safety restrictions are very shallow across the border--which also is good for corporations' profits. For Candi and Craig, who both worked at the factory, it meant a carefully balanced life of two working parents with young children was dumped quickly for corporate cash. Galesburg workers were suicidal. Their pensions were dumped, their dreams wasted. My grandfather was cheated out of his railroad pension through similar corporate tricks. It's not politics, it's corporate greed and shifty accounting. I could go on-- my cousin worked for Wal-Mart for 20 years and still has no benefits, they keep scheduling her for 38 hours per week-- she's 'freelance'-- but when Wal-Mart started to carry groceries, she was forced to sign a non-compete clause, which meant she had to quit her other job bagging groceries-- because that breaks the non-compete clause... I could go on...

I managed to struggle through ninth and tenth grade, until eleventh grade when I just basically gave up again, as I did in my original ninth grade. None of my teachers were actually trying to help me, so I was skipping classes and getting after-school detention and in-school suspensions. After one too many missed classes, my mother finally did the one thing that I will consistently be thankful for from her: she filed the paperwork to officially withdraw me from school, nearly age seventeen.

In my mind, hubris is the opposite of gratitude. And it is hubris that leads us to believe all our strengths – a slender physique, financial success, or public recognition – are due exclusively to our own hard work and merit. And, others’ weaknesses or setbacks are due to their slothfulness, intellectual feebleness, or gluttony.

Chef Jamie Thomas has created a menu littered with Iberian snacks, from bite-sized pintxos of kingfish pastrami and olives, to platos grande that includes slow cooked beef cheeks cooked in Pedro Ximenez. The restaurant menu -- available in the large dining room at the back -- is more comprehensive, but we're happy with the pared down pub menu, having settled in with beers and ciders at the bar.
A. Yes. Stubbies are made from glass not aluminium and are therefore harder to chew. But beer from stubby or can is the same as long as you pour it out into a clean glass first.

I’m not sure if you know many Catholics, but I can tell you for sure, we’re not the monolithic, homogenized, “jump to the Pope’s every proclamation” pack of lemmings that you may think. I, for one, believe that the church’s stance on birth control is socially irresponsible, morally insupportable, and just plain nuts. But I also think the church’s position on poverty, social responsibility, gun control, the death penalty, immigration, health care, equality, civil rights, justice, peace, and charity is truly inspired.

So I try to make sure I’m emotionally present as I can and as partnership and parenting needs me to be. I’m trying to connect to both the joy and the commitment of making it work despite lack of sleep, lack of time and lack of more to give. Having Ziya is an unparalleled gift and she makes me realize that what could be assumed or ignored or deferred before, needs to be dealt with now in myself and in all my relationships however hard that turns out to be. Like all children, she can make her parents our best selves together, but only if we know that caring, cooperation and connectedness are an achievement. Especially caring that nurtures communication, patience and a fierce sense of protection for marriage and love as valuable, just because they can make each of us shine, separately and together.
I am so fortunate to have made last year's Graphic 45 Design Team. Not only are the products insanely beautiful to work with, the entire Graphic 45 family is absolutely the sweetest, most understanding and generous individuals for which to design. It has been an absolute pleasure to create for such an amazing family and wonderful company.
Thanks to the wonderful medium of DVD, Eugenie De Sade has joined a growing library of choice cuts from the Spanish maestro. The Region 1 release - from Wild East Productions - apparently contains an acceptable transfer of this low budget film, with the added bonus of an "Unfinished Franco" supplement, comprising of 18 minutes of footage from 3 aborted projects shot in b&w between 1978-80 (one segment featuring Susan Hemmingway). While Oracle Entertainment's Region 2 UK release does not include this footage, their presentation of the main feature is nice and sharp, with strong colours. By all accounts, this is a far superior transfer though Franco completists may well look beyond this delicately balanced trade-off and purchase both.

Listen, is best all yuh go and read the full story and maybe find a copy of the Auditor General’s report, because what this pointing to is gross incompetence, breaches of protocol and mismanagement of public funds in at least 5 ministries…And this has led to wastage of public monies and if that is not Squandermania then I don’t know what is!
So, I’ve been reading over a lot of mock drafts lately and all I’ve come up with is after the first 2 picks no one seems to have any idea what’s going to happen. Will someone trade up to 3 or 4? What will the Browns do? Well, I’m going to attempt to answer those question. For each team I’m going to list 2 picks. The first will be who seems most likely to be taken. The second will be a guy I consider a fit for the team, but would be a bit of a surprise (at least to most of the analysts I’ve read)

The next week was Paper Cowgirl! Loved it! Karla Nathan was there teaching her "Dressform" class!!! AMAZING!! I had met Karla at Silver Bella back in November and loved her & her work!! This class exceeded all my expectations! Loved meeting Shelley Massey~ wonderful journaling class~ can't wait to take her classes again in the future! "Through the Seasons" with Jennifer Stewart was great~ we always enjoy Jennifer's classes! Lisa McIlvain taught "Encaustic Memories"~~ I feel in love with the industrial heat gun!!! My project turned out great~ I "encausted" a great picture of Gig~ my grandmother!!! She loves it!! Mom, Lexi & I had a wonderful weekend creating together! Friday night ~ Cindy hosted a Prom!!! What fun~ I wore my Senior Homecoming dress (which also happened to be Mom's 20 year Reunion dress!) Loved it and it was Polka dot and the prom was held at "Polka Dots!" We had vendors night Saturday and I really enjoyed vending again this year!

We switched to pistols and quickly it was pretty apparent that this was going to be some effort. By concentrating on the basics I had Mr. Hi-Point hitting doubletaps on two targets in under 4 seconds (from a fucking Hi-Point). This from a guy that has NEVER run any kind of drill or done anything more than one handed shooting at bottles about 10 yards out. The other gent did pretty well and was quiet pleased with himself. Downside – they burned through all of their pistol ammo. I have promised to cover it next time out. And I will come with twice what we used as a sign of good faith.

My query sucks.
There is an upside to this: if you like this style of house, you can find numerous examples of the type, most of which have been updated and available, eventually, when their owners give up, for the price of the land they sit on. I can’t think of any that are priced where I think they should be, but give time time, and you’ll do well. But just remember that, when you decide to sell it again, that the house will have gained nothing in value. You should pay for the land only and expect to sell for that, too. In the meantime, if you choose well, you’ll have a wonderful house to live in.
Red Wine Test Results: Not as bad as we expected, but the red wine did leave a faint pink tinge on both the sealed and unsealed sides. Given that our granite has some reddish-brown flecks in it, a small drip would probably go unnoticed if wiped up after 30 minutes.

A nearby farmer told StreekNuus he hadn’t seen anyone on the farm for the past four weeks, and the animals were not being looked after. They were not being injected and had developed diseases, and no lick had been set out for them. Another farmer told the newspaper that he had crops growing up against the fence between the two farms. The poor animals had stormed the fence to try and obtain moisture from the crops.
I have seen non-breeding swans in June follow a grizzly bear as it wandered past where they were feeding and as the bear swam the river channel the whole group of 30 swans followed, staying about 40 meters behind the bear. When the bear reached the other side and ambled down the sand spit the swans stopped in shallow water but continued to call until the bear was about 1/2 mile away,then the whole flock swam back to their feeding spot. I have also watched Sabine’s Gulls, Arctic Terns, and geese escort golden eagles out of the nesting area. They follow the eagle staying off to the side and slightly higher and all are calling and scolding the raptor till it gets far enough away from the nesting area that they feel safe enough to return to nesting duties. But this is the first time I have had swans escort me away from their young.
Some bubbles popped immediately - another greatly received (the contract w/ DaySpring for my card). One even combined with another and ended up becoming a fantastic new opportunity I had not thought possible (contributing to Gather Inspirit blog).

The climb became steeper and more tiresome, a few breaks for nicotine and water were essential but I was more than happy to take it slow and absorb the ambience, the calm, the awakening green and the song of a hundred birds rejoicing in a moment’s respite from the wind and rain. The path wound its way up the hill as if it were a pre-designed, purpose laid processional way. We snaked our way up and down, through twist and turn slowly, steadily… reverently. Along the edge of the path coppiced Hazel tree’s caught my eye, all growing bundles of perfect little stangs…I wonder if any of that lot had perhaps cut their stang from here?

The PS Publishing Independent Press Award:
A few months later, Dad discovered that a boyfriend of Constance von Baren, an Elvren Steinacre, had disappeared. Both families were devastated as the young couple had been betrothed to each other and were to be married later that fall. As we were friends to the entire village, we helped search for poor Elvren. About a week into the search, Dad found him. Or rather, what was left of him? Elvren had been brutally killed. Whispers throughout the village said that Elvren had dishonored the von Baren family by despoiling dear Constance. When she told Elvren that she was with child, he refused to marry her and ran away. But Dad now knew the truth. Only one sword could have left those marks on Elvren; the Platinum Sword of Dragonsbane.
'Amplified' is super atmospheric; Kelly really describes music perfectly. When I first started reading books with music in them, I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to 'hear the music', but so far I haven't had such a problem. It would be really cool if some of C-Side's tracks got recorded somehow, but that's probably wishful thinking. There are a few terms that, should you not be so musically inclined, you might need to look up. A little research on industrial rock also wouldn't hurt. I'll admit I'd never actually heard of the sub-genre before, but that's exactly what I love about reading. New stuff.
Day 4 (Lotte World – Myeongdong)
This also got me thinking about consumers at fast-food restaurants. Where I am in this world, it almost seems a rarity that patrons at fast-food chains clear up after themselves at the end of the meal. Unbelievable! This has bugged me for years, but it doesn’t change. Cultural differences, I was told. Excuses, I believe. But of course, who am I to impose my beliefs on others. I just don’t see why we can’t return our trays on our own and dispose of the waste along the way. I watched an elderly lady clear the tables around me and as I walked to the waste-bin to return the tray, she broke into a smile and exclaimed, “You’re the first today, thank you very much. See you again!” I laughed too, and thanked her as she gave the table a quick wipe.
Voila:
Almost 10,000 years after the invention of agriculture, humans discovered fossil fuels. This, of course, vastly increased their ability to extract wealth from the land and the seas. And, it allowed for increasingly specialization which led to technical breakthroughs that would have seemed akin to magic only a few generations ago.
I didn't see that here. We’re thrown into the mix of a child prodigy who's already a child prodigy. There's no "inciting incident" where we find out, for example, that he's special. For that reason, it took a lot longer to figure out what the story was about. And I’m not saying this is “wrong.” There’s no such thing as “wrong” when you’re writing. I’m just saying it was a risky choice, one I’m not sure paid off.

Preheat oven to 350 deg F / 180deg C. Coat an 8" x 8" square pan with vegetable spray.Whisk together the flour and salt in a bowl. In the large bowl of your mixer, on medium-high speed, beat the butter for a few minutes, until it's creamy. Gradually add in the sugar, beating now on high speed, until the mixture is light and fluffy; this may take several minutes. Add in the vanilla. In thirds, pour in the dry ingredients gradually, beating just until blended.
Scottish legal writer “Lallands Peat Worrier” points out that Coulson was a witness for the defence and not the prosecution, making it more difficult to argue that Coulson’s evidence formed a key part of the Crown’s case against Sheridan.

It's been super cold the past few days. This is why I don't like winter. I've never been that fond of winter, even as a child. I like a white snow - once a year. I don't like mind-numbing cold. That's why I've been looking forward to moving some place warmer though it looks like I'll have to wait until I retire to manage it.

I notice a lot of brides lately really don't like the idea of having anything 'fake' at their weddings. I take that to mean two things in the context of jewelry: They don't want to stop at the Macy's counter and pick up the same rhinestone silver plated crap they bought for the junior prom, or they don't want to buy something that looks like it was made in Paris at the turn of century, but was actually produced in Paramus 8 days ago.

This is the link to the 2nd episode in the season, you need to watch the 1st one first, this is VERY important! So the link to the 1st video is on this page, just scroll down til you see a section called "What others watched after this video" and find the one called "The Impossible Astronaut (1)". That's season 6 episode 1. After watching that one, then go back to the original link and watch the episode called "Day of the Moon (2)". These 2 videos make up a two-part episode, so it's important you watch them in order.

Across Europe, Nationalism is in the ascendency, in Britain it seems to have stalled, and although many Nationalists have worked tirelessly, many others have to accept their responsibility for that. Too many British Nationalists have spent the last 43 years since Enoch Powell warned us what was happening, squabbling amongst ourselves, sniping at other nationalists and indulging their own particular prejudices, issues and hang-ups rather than presenting the public with a party they feel comfortable in voting for.

I know I’m not the only mother out here who gets discouraged by the mundane dailyness of our tasks. I hear it from other moms. A lot. Like a lot, a lot. Why do we feel so unworthy for washing clothes, providing food then cleaning up the messes our families make while consuming it? Washing sheets, applying band-aids, driving and dropping off/picking up, or scrubbing the tub (once or twice a year)?

On Saturday we had cleaners in and they were able to tidy up the rest of the water and dry it right out. They will be coming back so we can determine where the water is getting in and what we should do about it. From what they were saying, with it being this wet there are a lot of basements that are having issues that have not had issues in the past. Then it will be a case of putting it all back together again.
Not having any money to buy a lot of food, I had to start getting creative. It started with mixing mashed potatoes and candied carrots in a bowl as a meal. Then noodles with salad dressing. (keep in mind folks, we're talking less than $10 a week on food here!). I had to be creative.

‘God’s commandments are always addressed to individuals. God chooses this or that person to do something specific. It is not a matter of a general law. We have no right to generalize the order. At most we may draw a lesson from it. Thus Jesus tells the rich young ruler to sell all his goods, to give to the poor, and to follow him. We must not generalize this command. We must not decide that all Christians have to sell their goods, etc. But the saying is designed to put us all on guard against riches.’

It has been a whirlwind few days. We've gotten through both boys' concerts. K12's on Tuesday and I14's last night. I14's concert lasted until 9:30! Yesterday, between work and other activities I was at home for a grand total of 90 minutes between 6:30 am and 10:15 pm! And that 90 minutes was packed with chicken chores, making pizza and a chicken tour. "A chicken tour?" you may ask. Yup. Jen (of EmSun) and her family stopped in briefly to pick up some eggs and her children really, really wanted to see the chickens. My children aren't excited by feeding the hens clover blossoms anymore so it was fun to see.

my boyfriend and I's relationship is turning 2nd year this Saturday, September 11.
Now 25, she lived on her own with her 18 month year old kitten called Socks. She was finally glad to have her own space so she could do all the normal stuff that 25 year olds did: walk around the house naked, leave her latest naughty purchases in appropriate places and most of all have who ever she wanted back without having to sneak them out the window. When she first moved in, she decided to leave her latest toy in the fridge, there was no particular reason it was just because she could. And when her latest conquest came back to hers for coffee, it was a fantastic conversation stopper, and a sexual starter when he opened the fridge to pass her the milk to find one cold looking penis shaped toy sitting next to the milk. He didn’t say anything, well not that she’d could remember any way – the only thing she could remember was how cold its head felt on her wet lips. The price of freedom was simply priceless.
The collective body of my Michigan writing has yet to inspire a parade. That doesn’t mean I can’t keep trying. My new, if nebulous, career goal is to continue to find new ways to tell the story of what’s happening in Michigan. Mike and I most recently started writing about our Michigan-made wedding as a way to showcase all the great local vendors we love. That has been, and will continue to be fun, and we’ve even been surprised to have attracted some press for it. That’s all well and good, but the scope is also a bit narrow. It’s also going to end in less than four months when the actual wedding finally happens (guess it’d better turn out to be a good time after all that, right?). So what to do next?
To cut a long story short, I lost my mind.... and quit my job! It is a long story and I shan't bore you with the details but I think it's fair to say that I'm happier than I've been in a long while and I'm excited about the opportunities that may be coming my way.

I love stars and the night sky as you have probably already guessed. I do paint rather a lot of night sky Maybe too many? Can you paint too many? I don't think so. ;) I was once told by my tutor at Art college to go and paint an article on abortion and that I couldn't make a living out of painting starry skies. He of course was telling me that life is not all sugar coated and twee and encouraging me to stretch myself and make my work more adaptable for commissions which of course was his job. I know that life is not all starry skies, we all know that, but we can choose what we want to include in it to a certain extent. Yes, I could do dark and I did and I still can if I want to. Just to prove it, here is a glimpse of that old darker work....

Does anyone ever say what they mean and mean what they say? That seems to be what our U.S. foreign policy is all about, determining truth from falsehoods, and formulating how we represent ourselves to others.

There is a role for Alex Cora on this team. You think Jerry Manuel made mistakes before? Pfffff! Luis Castillo is the money that needs to be swallowed ~ Not Alex's remaining $2 Mill contract. Cora can handle 4 infield positions very capably. You just released a lot of bench flexibility and LEADERSHIP. Remember it was Cora who cautioned a player or two about having such a good time right after a shamefully losing effort. Remember is was Cora who reminded Manuel to walk Jeter because Mariano Rivera was on deck as the next batter in an Inter-League game. He may not be re-writing the offensive record books but his glove work is and always has been stellar; he picks it with the best. Is this move in any way getting us closer or farther from a playoff spot? No; hardly. But Luis Castillo is the issue at hand, not Alex Cora. I'd rather have Cora on my bench if the Mets are going to call up Tejada. I'd rather have Alex Cora in the head and mind of our kids, helping them along the way.
I had a completely different getup planned for today, but it felt like a hazy romantic sort of morning. Sure enough, not long after I took these photos it started snowing--big, fluffy flakes like we've hardly seen all winter. We'll see if it sticks around. I'm just glad I have the weekend to huddle inside and catch up on Downton Abbey and do some hemming and Oscar-watching.
It would be three years until their first full length LP appeared. After signing with indy label Time Coast, they released Nightmare City and its concurrent single, "Too Much Junk." A decent-to-very-good album, it not only boasted the new single but several other excellent tracks ("Give Me A Little Pain," "Today," "One More Chance to Survive") and a snappy re-recording of "Nothing Means Nothing Anymore." Although the album drags in a few places and Stodola's lazy enunciation comes off as somewhat affected at points (and somewhat grating at others), those bright spots make it a hidden gem worth digging up. Nightmare City was eventually reissued on CD, but has been out of print for some time.

I was playing in front of my building when one of my friends told me about a good pickup game at the local schools court, we decided to check it out and we saw that all of the baskets were already taken. Luckily another one of my b-ball friends was at one of the baskets so we joined him, after a while some girls came up and said they were practicing for a tournament and wanted to play 3 on 3 with us.
It was then I decided not fight the incoming mob, filled with similarly stressed out medical professional types and just drive straight to the nearest convenience store with a tire pump. Being on the west end of Columbia, South Carolina and near two Interstate roadways convenience stores are as abundant as stars in the sky and weeds in my yard so a few minutes later I was pulling up to a prime example of excessive capitalistic greed, the coin-operated tire pump.

The Cloisters set the scene for our hero's first adventure, and I used Google Earth to find a suitable vantage point. The action takes place inside the main courtyard, but I used the southwest corner for the first shot of Daredevil. Additional details were found by scouring people's pics of the Cloisters on-line. I still haven't been there myself.
Although it was nominated for a couple of Razzie awards, this film is one of the most exciting heist films of the 20th century and is still at the top of my list today. Sensual, cunning and adventurous would be the three main words to describe this fine piece of cinema, and hopefully this review will shed some light on the wonderfully shot and executed style of this action thriller that keeps you guessing till the end.

We certainly believe that the “holy ones” are initially on earth in order to be harassed by the conspicuous horn. But the point is this harassment continues up until the point where the “holy ones” receive the kingdom. In the context of that prophecy, the manner in which they receive the kingdom is not described. If one were to refer to verse 13, again it would indicate that they would receive the kingdom in the same manner Christ did, in a heavenly setting. But I do not insist on this interpretation sticking just within the bounds of this prophecy, because it is not explicit as to how they receive the kingdom.

Why? Because there is no teacher like experience and, honestly, no more effective teacher than pain. Some of you can learn from other people’s mistakes. You can take someone’s word for what you should do. That doesn’t work for me. I need a reason to internalize the data. Once it’s in there, no one can take it away from me. I like that too.

This adoption has been a little different than the last three. The Lord had given me a dream back in December when we committed to Jonathan. I was geared up going onto a battlefield. I awoke knowing this was not going to be an easy adoption. We've had a lot of obstacles to overcome. I just don't post everything. There have been friendships lost, financial attacks, our vehicles not working, and the list goes on. But I can say this: we are NOT giving up! I know this precious boy is our son and I would claw through a brick wall to get to him (my friend Cindy's words).
Bennett fails into all the usual action movie cliché: he flies into hails of ten thousand bullets while never getting hit, but never misses himself.. He knocks out a Serbian soldier and takes his uniform. It happens to fit him perfectly. He even takes off the ski mask before he is completely out of danger just to reveal to the audience it is him. His final Tarzan-esque act as he is being rescued is laugh out loud funny, but not in a good way.

Are you super busy? Do you have more pressing; urgent matters to attend to? Do you have a lot of meetings to join? Do you have equally important personal tasks of your own? Do you expect them to act their age and to voluntarily look for you, call you, text you, or wait on you when they need anything? I’m asking because for sure, these are some of the reasons you might say in return in your defense. Right? Bear in mind that you are the manager. No matter how busy you are, it’s a hallmark of being an effective leader or being efficient in supervising people if you find time for them.

- If a knowledgeable nurse tells a doc that a patient has a Do Not Resuscitate order, the doc doesn't say, "Show it to me in the next five seconds or I don't believe you." The correct way to over-dramatize the scene is for the doc to note that attempted suicide is not covered by DNRs. Of course that route doesn't serve double-duty to show that the doctor is a jerk while Hawthorne is a fierce patient advocate and all-around superlady type.

In the season it’s a hard to find suitable package as the hotels are already get booked. Its very important to have a comfortable hotels per booked as the tour is not an easy one. Its a long and also trekking tour. Sometime its also heard that some of the hotels book your accommodation and give you confirmation but at the mean time when you reach to that hotel they refund your money and also tell you that your booking get canceled.
I suggest that playing games can be something of an art itself. A problem is that gamers often see themselves as an audience of a play and refuse to take responsibility for their part in the production. Game narratives have a player-shaped hole in them. Too often, after gamers decide to shove that hole full of nonsequiturs, contradictions, and sociopathy, they then hold it against the game for not stopping them. To me, this is like objecting to a crossword puzzle because you're able to complete it by writing "boobs" in all the spaces. A videogame is unfinished until its player makes the final creative contribution: you can either attempt to realise the game's potential or vandalise it for miscreant kicks.

Yes, I think that playing a role on stage and performing written dialogue when I act does help me with this aspect of my work. I think that it can help you develop an ear for what aspects of verbal storytelling work and hopefully avoid 'clonky' dialogue. I don't act out any of my work, but I do like to put myself behind my characters' eyes and see everything through them in a way that is very similar to the way that you do when trying to get into an acting role.

Author Fred Laurence Guiles speculates that Chaplin was insecure; that his fragile ego couldn’t stand the competition. However, this author’s humble theory is rather the opposite. Laurel was in no sense Chaplin’s equal. He’d been his understudy with the Karno troupe. When the tour disintegrated, he made his living for awhile as a Chaplin imitator (one of countless, but adding a legitimate grievance to the disdain Chaplin may have felt.)
Fox wasn’t a huge fan of some of the pieces in the Push Play invitational (meaning that many artists donated their work to this exhibit), but I found a lot of it really moving. Of course, with modern art there is a risk that you’ll get that nagging thought of “I know I’m supposed to have feelings about this, but I don’t know what they’re supposed to be.” One of the most confusing, yet morbidly fascinating, pieces was one done by Anne Drew Potter of group of female children in a circle acting like animals, while one lone child turns away and stares into the distance.

It's funny. Despite the incredible diversity of music put out during the seventies, when you ask someone to sing/hum something from that decade, you'll often get the stereotypical "bowm chicka wah wah" porn soundtrack. For some reason, the "wah wah" sound has been so inextricably linked to the seventies, it almost represents it as a whole! I'll admit the "wah wah" was used a lot - it was everywhere for a while. Disco used it almost without exception, game shows opened with it, Barry White made sweet love to it, and TV detectives put the smackdown on pimps and drug dealers to it. It's unfortunate that the decade ended with the world still enmeshed in the omnipresent "wah wah".

The question naturally presents itself—why did St. Gregory choose April 25 for a procession and Station in which everything reminds us of compunction and penance, and which would seem so out of keeping with the joyous season of Easter? The first to give a satisfactory answer to this difficulty was Canon Moretti, a learned liturgiologist of the eighteenth century. In a dissertation of great erudition, he proves that in the fifth, and probably even in the fourth, century, April 25 was observed at Rome as a day of great solemnity. The faithful went, on that day, to the Basilica of St. Peter, in order to celebrate the anniversary of the first entrance of the Prince of the Apostles into Rome, upon which he thus conferred the inalienable privilege of being the capital of Christendom. It is from that day that we count the twenty-five years, two months, and some days that St. Peter reigned as Bishop of Rome. The Sacramentary of St. Leo gives us the Mass of this solemnity, which afterwards ceased to be kept. St. Gregory, to whom we are mainly indebted for the arrangement of the Roman Liturgy, was anxious to perpetuate the memory of a day which gave to Rome her grandest glory. He therefore ordained that the Church of St. Peter should be the Station on that auspicious day. April 25 comes too frequently during the octave of Easter that it could not be kept as a feast, properly so called, in honour of St. Peter’s entrance into Rome; St. Gregory, therefore, adopted the only means left of commemorating the great event.

She finally asked for the rest - after she read it, she said it was wonderful - and that her company wouldn't publish it because they only publish first-hand accounts of the Holocaust and this was fiction.

Parts of it did, taken from stories of survivors. But it's a blend and some sections - I don't even know where it came from - it just poured out of me for months at a time.

Better safe than sorry. Those who risk the most never experience the security of living in the status quo.

After the war, in 1945 Robert picked up his freelance artist’s career. He became friends with Norman Williams who, from 1950, would illustrate many of Eagle’s true life adventures. Through Norman Williams, in 1955 Robert was recruited by Marcus Morris to illustrate a new adventure strip set in the times of the Napoleonic Wars. The strip, written by George Beardmore was ‘Jack o’Lantern’. It quickly became one of the most popular strip stories in Eagle, as recorded by the Hulton readers poll at the time.

Poetry is my mistress, I know that may sound a cliche, but it’s a reality that I experience daily. She’s demanding, she forces me to act bold, unafraid, and she challenges me to always write original, to remain true to myself, and to explore new territories. Whenever I am happy or sad, she lets me express my thoughts or vent my frustrations. She never judges me. She just listens. She only encourages me to let it all out, and she likes to expose me naked. My life without poetry would just be like a pile of waste. To move forward, to live my past behind, I need her, I need her to move on, to breathe. She calms me down when I am angry, mad, or disgusted. She gives me comfort when I feel alone. She joins me to celebrate my moments of excitement. She helps me escape from my worries, troubles, dilemmas, disappointments, hurts, etc. I have never relied on alcohol, cigarette, or other substances that certainly have the potential to ruin my life as alternatives to escape from reality. Poetry replaces them all. She’s the best mistress one can ever ask for. I am obsessed with her. And I would rather be obsessed with her than anything else. She allows me to tell the truth, my truth, a process which always heals me when I am wounded. I know that the truth hurts. No one wants to heart it, including me. But she forces me to face, express, explore, and share it with others! But when I share what comes out of me, I never intend to hurt anyone. If unknowingly I have hurt you, I deeply regret, and I apologize!

She stared in horror as a crack appeared between her feet, ran across the floor, up the wall and onto the ceiling. There was a splintering whack! like a gun-shot, and seconds later the room was pulled in two. Part of the upper floor collapsed, crushing the dining room table she had cowered under a minute earlier. A huge support beam snapped and dropped from overhead. Natalie dove out of the way, just as it swung like a wrecking ball and smashed the kitchen counter to pieces.

On a personal note, I would like to thank Father James for inviting me to his ordination on Saturday. I am convinced that he has many great gifts, and will be of great service both to the Ordinariate and to the universal Church as a whole. I was particularly grateful to him for the words he chose whilst praying over me when I went up to receive his first blessing on Saturday - his actions confirmed to me that here is a man who will be an excellent shepherd to his flock.

That night, about 11:00, Carter woke up crying, Greg went to check on him and he had thrown up. I got up and bathed Carter, and put him in fresh pajamas while Greg changed his sheets. I started to feel sick and then I threw up. I thought it might just be from cleaning up Carter, so I didn't think anything of it. Carter threw up again and I then I did also. I started to feel so sick to my stomach that I could barely move without gagging. Greg ended up taking care of Carter until about 2:30 when he finally quit throwing up and went to sleep. I just laid in bed, trying not to move and trying not to throw up. My stomach hurt so bad and I was so miserable. About 3-4, I ran to the bathroom, but didn't make it in time and threw up all over the bathroom. Greg got up and cleaned the bathroom and helped me back in bed. I ended up throwing up again before I finally fell asleep.

At this point, it was decided that the landlord would call the police just in case the guy decides to return at some point. Meanwhile, My Friend and I are in our apartment hashing out more oddities that were previously dismissed. For instance, when My Friend got home from work, he found a cup with Kool-Aid in it and Kool-Aid splatters all over the kitchen counter and floor. He assumed that it was messy me (granted, I’m messy, but not that messy) and cleaned up the spills and went about his business.

Contains: a sex scene, violence, language, bootlegging and drinking, but for me the biggest hurdles were I was upset with two scenes. The first when Cordelia leaves her husband (I wondered why she didn’t run away before the wedding instead of after). The other is when Cordelia’s brother is seen cheating on his girl friend in the afore-mentioned sex scene. But in the end, neither was enough to stop me from finishing the story.
In recent reading of Dembski and other ID proponents I saw them make a claim which has been made for over 40 years. This claim is one that the young-earthers have been making. The claim is that the theory of evolution (or major supporting concepts for it) is increasingly being abandoned by scientists, or is about to fall. This claim has many forms and has been made for over 178 years. This is a compilation of the claims over time. The purpose of this compilation is three-fold. First, it is to show that the claim has been made for a long, long time. Secondly, it is to show that entire careers have passed without seeing any of this movement away from evolution. Third, it is to show that the creationists are merely making these statements for the purpose of keeping hope alive that they are making progress towards their goal. In point of fact, no such progress is being made as anyone who has watched this area for the last 40 years can testify. The claim is false as history and present-day events show, yet that doesn’t stop anyone wanting to sell books from making that claim. Now for the claims in chronological order.

To appreciate Sokurov’s Faust, it vastly helps if the viewer is familiar, or at least acquainted with the subject dealt in the film. It is notable to recall Sokurov’s statement given to critic Steve Rose of The Guardian newspaper: "I'm a very literary person, not so much a cinematographic person. I don't really like cinema very much." It is an unusual statement for a filmmaker to make. Yet, it makes sense if you are familiar with the later cinematic works of Kozintsev and, in particular, Sokurov’s film Faust. Three independent and great literary works deal with the backbone of Sokurov’s movie Faust. Both Kozintsev and Sokurov devoured the literary masterpieces and presented those works as cinema adding to the existing value with additional sequences, visuals, and music that make these movies much more valuable for the enquiring mind than the original literary idea. Sokurov creates this magic with the aid of his trusted screenplay writer Yuri Arabov, with whom he has collaborated on most of his major cinematic works.

Ennahdha’s moderation, however, has cost it support both among its more conservative members, many of whom are more influenced by traditional Muslim Brotherhood political ideas (from whence the movement began) and by an increasingly vocal Salafi movement, which while officially excluded from politics, is making itself and its views seen across the country. And despite its moderation on key positions, its inaction against rising extremism and its seeming complicity against very public threats to basic freedoms has made Tunisian secularists skeptical if not openly worried about the future path Ennahdha will take.

I'm making a tart au citron out of all these effing lemons. I sucked in the city streets and went for holiday drinks with expat friends here. I skyped with my family, it was the next best thing to being there! I made cookies here with my French fam, and we had our own inside jokes around the fire. Our glasses were filled to the brim with Champagne and wine to die for. We ate Fois Gras, Chapon with roasted vegetables and Chestnut purée, stinky cheeses, and of course... my chocolate chip cookies! We even had snow, by god, SNOW in PARIS! It's been pretty magical.

The reason I wrote this was that a friend posted on Facebook that she was repainting her living room with a color named Alpaca, which she said was just another name for a neutral beige. I'm not sure when this naming of colors thing started — maybe it was Martha Stewart who started the trend with her paint line for Sears. My bathroom is painted with a color called Sea Glass which sounds a whole lot better than aqua and fits perfectly with my seashore-themed bathroom. But, I've seen real sea glass in all sorts of colors and who's to say that you don't think Sea Glass is a different shade of green than what I picture.

This is definitely one of the best bottles yet. With that said, I can’t really say that I noticed any drastic improvement in the taste of the wine given its older vintage and higher price.

We find your instructions playing a most unique role in understanding guruship, post1977. In order to gain a realistic perception of what happened in ISKCON after 1977, one has to go back in time and see things as they were then. In 1977, after your samadhi, and a few years thereafter, everyone understood without a doubt, that ‘guru’ is synonymous with ‘pure devotee’ i.e. Guru never falls. Nobody in ISKCON even dreamt of a philosophy that accommodated the idea of a guru falling down. It was just not ISKCON’s philosophy then is an historical fact. In the following conversation you clarified that the acarya has to be a pure devotee and that the idea that he falls down to mode of passion is a concocted one.

The Japanese government is also telling the fishermen in Taiji that the dolphins are eating too much fish, and should therefore continue the drives. Ric O’barry was told by town officials that the real reason for the drive hunts is “pest-control”. The dolphins eat large quantities of fish, so the fishermen look at the dolphins as a roadblock to a bountiful harvest. Without any consideration for the role over-fishing has played in the declining fish population, the blame is put on the dolphins. When the Taiji fishermen were asked if they would leave their boats tied up at the dock if they were paid the same amount of money as they would have made by hunting and killing the dolphins, they replied that it was not about money, it was about pest-control. Since 2003, Japan has cited scientific data blaming the decline in global fisheries on dolphins and whales, creating the illusion that they are hunting dolphins for different reasons than money. But the only actual reason why the Japanese fishermen still conduct these dolphin drive hunts is in fact profit.

I had a great testing surface as it was frozen slush, snow, and ice. I ran through these elements with ease....at least the snow and slush. It was just enough grip to have your foot land securely but not so much that you had to work harder to free your foot from the snow. Ice is its own demon, the Yaktrax definitely helped but you still need to be careful. There were a couple of spots where it was black ice on a downward slope and there was nothing to grip...I don't think anything helps in this situation. The other thing I noticed was that the coils didn't collect snow and slush. I wasn't sure if I would have to kick snow that got stuck in them during the run. I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe it was a fluke, but I haven't a chance to test this again.

Some argue that too many students are losing “critical opportunities for learning-and too many teachers are leaving the profession-because of the behavior of few persistent troublemakers” (Public Agenda, p. 135). However, I question if the strict policy of zero tolerance will truly deter those “persistent troublemakers” from causing trouble. It is my view that this policy is too rigid and while it may help curb some problems. it does in fact unfairly targets other issues that in reality are benign and repairable. Suspending a student for accidentally brining a camping utensil that has a butter knife attached to the end does not carry the same weight as brining a gun on purpose concealed in a backpack, yet both are weapons and both punishments under zero tolerance may carry the same outcome. Students and teachers should feel safe and secure while at school, I don’t know if zero tolerance creates that security. A resource officer patrolling the school halls may often intimidate students but I question if the presence of that officer will deter the troublemakers from creating trouble.

As I continued walking home listening to Miley sing, I realized it has taken me a year to reach this particular goal. I climbed many mountains along the way. I tried running this particular distance several times and failed. But no matter how many times I failed at THIS distance, I kept climbing to reach my other goals and my other distances and I never stopped climbing and reaching. And today, a year later, I finally achieve this one “little” thing! It’s not about how fast I got here and it certainly isn’t about what’s on the other side (cause usually the other side of a 5K run means longer runs to train for…but I have already done those other runs and finished them in my goal times), it’s just about the climb and what I have learned about myself in this last year’s climb!

At Stannis’ camp, Davos has a terrifying story for his lord about the macabre birth he witnessed and how that caused the death of Stannis’ brother, but Stannis doesn’t want to hear it. He would much rather just sit back and enjoy the fruits of his success than think about where they came from. The only thing that Davos is able to accomplish is to convince Stannis to leave Mellisandre behind at the forthcoming battle for the capital. In Pyke, Theon meets the crew of his ship, the Sea Bitch, and they have about as much respect for Theon as his sister does. However, Theon (thanks to his first mate) has an idea about trying to capture a Northern town which leads to a brilliant moment about their potential ability to capture Winterfell itself. Ruh roh roobie. At the hellhole known as Harrenhal (voted #1 Most Likely Place for a Rat to Burrow Through Your Chest in Westeros), Arya is Tywin Lannister’s cup-bearer and is privy to his war meetings where he plans to find a way to crush her brother. Twyin didn’t just realize that Arya is a girl. He also figured out she’s a northerner and grills her about the people’s opinion of Robb. It’s a wonderful scene where we see just how icy cold Arya is becoming lately. Arya also gets an offer from Jaqen H’gar who is now in the employ of the Lannisters (he’s the strange foreigner who Arya helped escape a couple weeks ago from burning to death). Because Arya saved his life (and his two companions), he will kill any three men that Arya names. Arya names the “Tickler”, the man that is the head torturer at Harrenhal.
Perhaps other love signifiers you have employed, the aforementioned sex substitutes such as travel and adventure, will lose their appeal as most overindulged activities eventually do. The glory of having a wide range of love signifiers is that as you gradually become bored of them, as you would in your own solitary life, you get to see how you both grow together, dropping some interests and picking up new ones. With a sexual relationship, you don’t have this level of freedom. Once the sex is gone, there’s really nothing to replace it with other than non-gratifying sex.

I remember being pretty outgoing and friendly as a little kid. It was fifth grade that changed all that. I can even pinpoint the exact moment that my social world came crashing down. A girl who had supposedly been my best friend for about a year, actually started a club called "The Vickie Destroyers," complete with a whole-page typed manifesto, detailing how she and a few other girls were going to destroy me. When I found out about it, she crossed out my name and wrote in a different girl's above where mine was still visible on the page.

This was one strange movie. I thought it was a remake of Bad Lieutenant, the Abel Ferrara movie starring Harvey Keitel but after watching it I’m not sure. Anyway Nicolas Cage portrays a rather corrupt cop in New Orleans and the movie is directed by none other than Werner Herzog. Why a genius like Herzog would take on a project like this I don’t know. The result is a rather average thriller/crime movie. Or perhaps it’s a drama. I’m not sure.
If you’ve ever visited a foreign country, you may have been struck by the exotic features of the local cuisine. You may have marvelled: Do they eat this sort of thing? Can they cook this in this way?? Our gastronomic habits are as ingrained as everything else that makes us what we are, so we naturally react to raw squid or fried pickles, if they for some reason haven’t found their way into our regular diet.

Despite the proliferation of Johns around me, I never had a nickname in grade school. That made my mother happy. She was a traditionalist who hated nicknames.

It was a great childhood.

In a matter of moments I felt the sensation a large pulsing hot rock forcing its way past my asshole, pushing deep into my rectum. That rock was rhythmically throbbing, each pounding spasm leaving a pounding echo of pleasure that reverberated inside of me. The echoes were getting louder and more resonant as they clustered. The base of my cock began to throb with the metronome beat of the arousal that was thrumming inside my anal canal.

However, that theme, along with a lot of the jokes, seem to somehow get lost in the shuffle of this 2 hour and 4 minute movie. It seems like every rom-com lately has started to fall into this path where they aren’t just about being a funny, romantic movie, but they also have to have a huge deal of drama in it too, just so it can even things out. The film seems very disjointed in parts, as it was more just a bunch of sketches put together, but they were still funny enough to hold me over and get past it. But by last couple of acts where the film shows Violet and Tom’s relationship starting to crumble down, the film starts to get a bit darker and focus more on the sadness these two have away from each other, rather than focus on some cool moments of comedy. It’s actually a big downer when these two aren’t together because not only does it take a lot of steam out of the comedy, but the idea of these two being perfect for each other is uprooted as well.

We unwind scarves, remove snowsuits, undo boots. I pass the baby to her mother, a soft, plump burden of love, and then seek out the box full of little toy cars for her brother. I bring out, too, the big Noah's Ark with all the animals. Ben finds this fascinating. Soon giraffes and lions, sheep and elephants, jostle for position in the ark alongside myriad little cars. Baby Ashley gums and drools on a sculpted plastic camel.

In the multimedia department, you won’t run out of options with either of these phones. The Droid RAZR and the iPhone 4S have 8-megapixel cameras at the back that can record full HD 1080p video. The Galaxy Nexus can also record 1080p video, but, surprisingly, Samsung put only a 5-megapixel shooter on Google’s phone, which is less than what we have seen on other phones from the manufacturer, such as the Galaxy SII. All three phones also have video chat cameras on the front.

Our immune system is broken. We promise punishment in our Elections Act whenever someone suppresses the ability of a Canadian to vote, but ten months after RoboCon, and 4 years after S-GI’s NDP robocalls in 2008 there’ve been exactly 0 charges laid. There should be millions of dollars in fines waiting for the guilty party. RoboCon is HIV for our electoral system.

It made me think that although I'm not enjoying the general greyness in the weather, I do like grey as a colour. I often wear it, and I like having a little grey around the house. It offsets white beautifully, and reminds me of granite and driftwood and scantle slate roofs - things that I think of as being inherently cornish.
His barrister Phillip Boyd read out a series of references speaking up for his client to the jury. One of them from Councillor Aftab Hussain said: "I have known Abdul Qayyum for the last 10 years as a local resident in the area. He lives with his wife and two children. Mr Qayyum is a hard-working person. He has worked hard throughout his life. Within the community, he comes across very well and I have never seen or heard of any wrongdoing before this case. I personally was shocked to hear about this news."
So many of these children have been around the moon more times than we have… And they remember it. Allow for as much freedom at home as is possible for their safety. I’m talking about allowing them to cook food, create and hang art wherever they want to, clean, organize, pick out clothes, pay at the grocery store, pick groceries, call friends and relatives who they want to speak to. This will allow them to align more quickly with what they like and who they are.

8. Keep a tidier house. I can't seem to commit a full day to cleaning--I just get too distracted, it's no fun at all, plus it's tough to keep up with all of Graham's simultaneous messes on the side. I am testing out a new system, where I clean 1-2 rooms each day (when I am not working). I've also started a new routine of setting a time every night after tucking G into bed and fully devoting 20 minutes to straightening up. So far, so good!

Despite raining in the evenings for the past two nights, thankfully, the sky that night was clear & dry. The 15.5km route took us practically all the way round the smooth 5.5km F1 track. Thereafter, we ran on the outer service track for another 6km, before circling another 4km inside the hollowed ground.

If you cannot eliminate a bad diet, gradually cut down your intake of these memory-inhibiting foods. This is not only beneficial to the memory, but it changing your diet to a balancing one will lead to a more fulfilling life too.

A bit too much, in fact.

I went to church for the second time this past week at a new church. It hurts to have to try to find a place of worship anywhere except with my children. But their dad being the worship leader–still, at the church we attended before, and now dating another worship leader there, and with the backing of the church leadership, I just can’t. The kids are happy there, their friends are there, so it seems only right they stay. It is hard to trust other adults to hold such influence in the lives of my children in a place where I do not feel welcome, and where I do not support leadership’s decision to allow my ‘husband’ to date, prior to the divorce being finalized.

Most olives, and this is about to be the case for the 38 trees on the plot we look after, end up being pressed to extract their precious oil. But before stripping the branches next week we have careful picking to do, selecting and preserving the olives we want for table and kitchen use. Personally, I am beside myself with excitement at this. Having lived in the UK since summer term ended at Bologna I have never had real, live olives to play with. This is a voyage of discovery, and some background reading is required.

There were no role models who looked like me in America's political culture, the world of fame, fortune, film and fashion. Even the countless billboard signs that propagandized Americans from one end of the country to the other were completely devoid of anything resembling me or my culture. In fact, the only person who looked like me who was well known when I was growing up, was the Lone Ranger's Indian sidekick, Tonto, a name which means "Dummy" in Spanish. You can be sure we wondered if that name choice was deliberate.

Let me make a suggestion to all who would call themselves God’s people through Christ. This suggestion applies to situations beyond the media’s current hobby. Unless, and until, we have the facts…ALL THE FACTS… – stay out of it. This case is not about truth. It is not about justice. It is about advancing an agenda, and the results are likely to be “the shedding of innocent blood.” Those guilty of this crime will answer for their actions on Judgment Day, and I pray God’s mercy to not be counted among them.

I felt the weight of this in my own life recently while getting lunch at a local restaurant. I pulled in behind a pickup truck that from top to bottom screamed “tea party nutcase.” The bumper was coated in right-wing bumper stickers and had a Larry the Cable guy quote thrown in for good measure. Sure enough, as the two men exited the cab, they were both wearing overalls with trucker hats.

I thought surgery was not an option until my till last MRI at MD Anderson's. At this point, Dr. Gilbert was very convincing that I did need surgery, and my options were slim. An operations that could take away my speech, mobility to my right side, and risk my quality of life. A surgery that as best usually removed 80 % of the tumor, even on not so complicated cases. MY TUMOR IS 100 % gone!!! Tears fill my eyes as write this. God was been my strength from day one, and even on the darkest of days he held my hand, and has proven miracle on my life each and each days. 100%. I'm still battling actual cancer cells and will probably start chemo over the next week, but I will cross that bridge when I come to it.

I see the OB on Thursday and need to decide if I want to try birth control pills. Possible pro: no excruciating ovulatory pain, no constant zany 16-22 day cycles. Possible con: my edema may be due to an inflammatory process in my blood vessels and I haven't have my antiphospholipid antibodies checked, both of which may increase risk of blood clots. Will have to bring that up. And I'm wondering if my androgens/insulin resistance should be checked.

I woke up this morning with the final verses of 1 John 4 on my heart. I love it when the Holy Spirit speaks directly to me. I haven't thought of or read these verses in awhile and yet, this morning I woke to the words, "perfect love drives out fear." I have had some fear this week as I look at our mountain and it's a little silly at this point. God has already moved nearly $30,000 out of the way, so one would think that the last $3,500 wouldn't make me nervous, at all. It does. It's uncomfortable to need to ask for help (again).

I learned with a new force just how much of an influence Patrick Rothfuss is on me. I read 'The Wise Man's Fear' while I was plugging through the middle of 'Some Kind of Angel', and I'm not sure I'd have kept going otherwise. It's a wonderful book, but more importantly there's an irrepressible joy to the language Rothfuss uses. 'The Name of the Wind' powered significant parts of 'Heaven Can Wait' in the same sort of way. I guess when it comes to November, I'll just have to re-read them both. Or go to Wisconsin and steal the text of the next book...

"American society has lost confidence that there's a single alternative," she said. "Anybody can express an opinion on a blog or any other outlet and there's no system of verification or double-checking, you just say whatever you want to and it gets magnified.

Here is the recipe we were given in school, written by our instructor, Cathy Burgett. Make sure you use a large enough pot for this recipe. The boiling sugar will grow quite a bit, especially when you add the cream and butter. Be careful it doesn't overflow!

Happy memoir writing.
The chapters in the present are narrated from Kinsey’s perspective. The ones in the past are presented through a variety of narrators, providing the reader with both an inside and outside view of the crime. Because we view the events through multiple points of view, we judge for ourselves the characters’ motivations, and become intimately connected with the resolution of the crime. And, as Marilyn Stasio suggests in her New York Times review of the novel, “by alternating Kinsey’s brisk first-person narrative with dramatic flashbacks that catch the spirit of the town during its volatile post-war period, Grafton allows Violet to emerge as a dynamic but dangerous life force – irresistible to men, threatening to women and too reckless for her own good.”

One of the most insightful comments I’ve seen came from Emmalise on a post I wrote last February. She talked about how she likes the teamwork aspect of raiding, how rewarding it is when 25 people all team up and get a boss fight. A week of wipes and frustration and let’s-try-this and what-about-that pays off when suddenly it all clicks. I call it the collective a-ha moment, and it’s an important part of why I raid, too.

In our second podcast on the notorious Five Points neighborhood, we see how the district changed with the influx of new immigrants and the valiant attempts to reform the seedier elements.

Today we are going to brunch (LOL - in the afternoon) with Amy and Rex and Keith. It will be a nice day. I know Ron has a card for me because he had Amy get one at the store yesterday (I tried to not notice when she brought it in and gave it to him). He said he owes her $20 so there's something else that she got, too. Probably some candy that I'll love but that I don't need (doesn't mean I won't eat it!). I probably have cards in the mailbox waiting for me (haven't been to the mailbox for a few days). I will go pick up my mail sometime today just so the box doesn't get too full (it's down the street but not on the way home so I forget to go get the mail).
Some people say that the IPKat gets angry too easily at soft targets like the World Intellectual Property Organization and that he's unduly critical of those noble souls who administer IP systems both internationally and on the domestic front. The good news is that the Kat will have a go at what appears to him to be wasted effort, squandered money and poor judgment wherever he finds it. One such instance is Case T‑139/08, The Smiley Company SPRL v Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, where it is a Community trade mark applicant who is on the receiving end.

Sometimes I get so caught up teaching that I don't allow students to share things about their personal lives. This year my students always had connections. Connections while I was reading, connections during mini- lessons and connections during presentations. It was so distracting that we even used a signal of two fingers touching to signal that they had a connection, but that it didn't necessarily need to be shared with everyone. This year, I would like to start of the day by talking, discussing our weekends, our homework, sports, family time, tooth loss etc.

We woke the kids up at 6am Christmas morning to see the presents St. Nick had left and then it was time to get ready for church. We are so blessed Gemma came to us knowing the true meaning of Christmas and that it was Jesus' Birthday! After a beautiful Christmas Mass we headed home to snap a quick family pic, change clothes, have a quick breakfast and sit down to pass out the gifts. Gemma was just grinning ear to ear. We opened our presents by taking turns and going from youngest to oldest, one at a time. Gemma caught on very quickly and knew it was her turn when Keaton was done! ha Ava actually understood and enjoyed Christmas much more this year too. The older kids really did a great job at getting excited for the little ones.

I think Michelle Obama is intimidating for some people. I mean, no matter how 'brilliant' Condi Rice is, there's still a part of society that says, ' yes, she's been able to rise and succeed, BUT..what did she have to give up in order to do it? A husband and family.' Though Elizabeth Edwards was as smart as John Edwards, and had the career, marriage, and the kids, she STILL sort of looked like a 'hot mess' as the phrase goes. And, though Hillary Clinton was definitely as smart as Bill Clinton, and they had the marriage, and the perfect child, there was that burden of Bill's ' extracurriculars'.

Even if you don’t live in Denmark or the US, you still ought to be concerned; the US government has now claimed the right – and has the practical power due to much of the internet’s backbone being located on American soil – to seize any domain ending in .com, .org, .net, .biz, .cc, .tv and .name no matter what country it’s registered and based in. And that means if federal prosecutors want to, they can impose prudish American standards of “obscenity” on the great majority of internet content in the entire world.

He is a true hero. Emma is a mixture of characteristics, quiet and demur one moment, the next running and screaming, and the next manipulating people to do what they want. The father’s faith is enviable and I—and most readers—could learn from him. Mammi, Emma’s little sister, and Luke’s best friend added comic relief to the story. I laughed out loud in several places.
Edit: I’d be interested to know your opinions, whether or not you’ve read the book. It might be stale news now, but still worthy of discussion I feel.
Strength: This is a high major team wearing a mid-major’s uniform. Long Beach St is as talented as many teams in the power six conferences. It has a bonified NBA player in Casper Ware and a great cast around him. They’re athletic, they can score and they will strike the fear of God into who steps on the court with them. This is the team that nobody wants to play.
I wrote an epic song in my dreams. Good? Well, it wasn't bad. I even had the score worked out, if not something I could put to musical score paper, it was something I could have... sort of... hinted at in a demo. All gone shortly after waking, and probably better for it. What would I do with ka-trillions of dollars in royalties? Oh, dream big ladies and gents, dream big. No, my dream never went that way anyway. I actually offered it up for free, with a few caveats. One, they had to do it my way. Two, if it became a commercial success then a little tribute in the form of gold would be nice. And third, if it was really successful, and they wanted more, that tribute best be worth it and the next song would be negotiated based on all that. I even had some Finnish or Swedish operatic goth band take the song and do it my way. I never did get to hear it though. Ah well.

The real question is what does one do with the garden tub wall? I don't even have tile like the above picture..but I think it will need something. Any thoughts? What could I do for super cheap but get super fabulous results?
So, in summary, these things are less of a product of Japan's whisky culture than an outgrowth of the probably universal desire for a cheap way to get blasted (but are developing beyond those roots). Their existence will, nevertheless, have a great bearing on the future of Japanese whisky, not least because they are sustaining Japan's large whisky distilling sector. International competition winning single malts were never going to be able to do that on their own.
When he returned (with an arrival time of 7:15 AM at the airport one hour away and on a Sunday when I was scheduled to hold a choir practice and also sing a duet in church...) and got to unpacking his suitcase, he presented me with a skein of yarn. And an apology for it not being the kind of yarn I usually like.

I want to show you the striking contrast by reading Galatians 5:19-23. “Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings and such like.”
In a statement, the group added: “The hijab or scarf worn on the head is an obligation in Islam on every Muslim woman when outside of the house or in the company of non-family members.
In my words, the ultimate goal of a successful web experience management solution is to enable your brand or company (depending on definition) to scale positive, individual interactions. This goal begs the question: why is it important to scale those interactions? What are the forces that inspire companies to spend millions if not billions of dollars to accomplish this goal? I believe the WEM movement is part of a general shift from the traditional, one-size-fits-all business strategies of past text book fame to a consumer-driven personalization model.*

my desire to blog is high but the ability is low. I busy with life and kids. This is my attempt to have more focus on getting my life in order and not just letting my life order me. 2 Corinthians 5:17 (NLT) says : This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun! As spring is here and I ponder what I think God would have for me in this life I realize that I need to be more purposeful. I don't think that I am out of God's plan for me but I do think that he has more for me. With that being said here are my goals for having a more God honoring life.
Three: Where oh where are our popular Tv’s? As uninspiring as it is to have to decorate around a huge, metal, dark rectangle – it is a reality. I have 3 in my home. I triple dog-dare-you. Most gorgeous living room galleries are sans Tv’s. We have them and we aren’t going to live without them. We need to realistically combine their reality into our designs without aborting elegance. Honestly, the most gorgeous living rooms and bedrooms I see photos of, are without Tv’s. Yet, every human being alive today requires a flat screen in practically every room of their home, with subsequent remotes gooping up table tops. Let’s see more galleries and luxurious homes that portray the beauty and the beast.

In Australia, where I live, both main political groups embrace market-driven economics: namely the Liberal/National Parties, the main conservative political group, and the Labor Party, which, although losing many voters to the Greens, is still the main left-of-centre party. Or perhaps we should say, the main “nominally” left-of-centre party. Because if there is no difference in the economics on both sides, then is there any real difference at all?

As a result of such actions, many Muslims are exercising a new boldness in America. In fact, Muslim "honor killings" have now arrived in the United States (most recently in Texas); and just a few weeks ago, direct action was taken to prevent the honor-killing of a 17-year old Muslim girl in Ohio who converted to Christianity and, in fear of her life, fled from her parents to Florida.
But back to my original point: I got an email that I’ve attained the new cert “Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate” on Windows 2008. Being always suspicious of “free” stuff I immediately put 2 and 2 together and saw that my new cert was MCSA, which has always been the lesser of Microsoft certs. I’d seen all the articles lately saying that they were completely changing the program again for Windows 8 (now 2012) so I assumed that when the new software got released that I’d have to change over. Who knew that you needed to re-up before the new one even came out??

In 1976, Selsor was tried by a jury and sentenced to death. He also received life imprisonment for shooting with the intent to kill Ina Morris. Later that year, Oklahoma’s death penalty was ruled unconstitutional by the U. S. Supreme Court, and the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals adjusted Selsor’s sentence to life imprisonment. In 1996, the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Selsor’s conviction. During a retrial in 1998, Selsor was again convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.
For those of you wondering if France has a military, the answer is bien sûr. And last weekend it was out in full force to celebrate La Fête Nationale. Don't let the wimpy equipment fool you; these photos were shot in the 14th arrondissement long after the ceremonies had broken up. There was a ton of action on the Champs Élysées. We watched a bit of it in on T.V. It was bizarre to see the beauty of the Arc de Triomphe and all the crowds and realize that it was just a short metro ride away.

7. “Merciful and pitiful is the Lord long-suffering, and very merciful” (ver. 8). “Sweet is the Lord to all, and His compassions reach into all His works” (ver. 9). Were. He not such as this, there would be no seeking to recover us. Consider thyself: what didst thou deserve, O sinner? Despiser of God, what didst thou deserve? See if aught occur to thee but penalty, if aught occur to thee but punishment. Thou seest then what was due to thee, and what He hath given, who gave gratis. There was given pardon to the sinner; there was given the spirit of justification; there was given charity and love, wherein thou mayest do all good works; and beyond this, He will give thee also life everlasting, and fellowship with the angels: all of His mercy. …Hear the Scripture: “I will not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should turn, and live.” By these words of God, he is brought back to hope; but there is another snare to be feared, lest through this very hope he sin the more. What then didst thou also say, thou who through hope sinnest yet more? “Whensoever I turn, God will forgive me all; I will do whatsoever I will.” Say not then, “To-morrow I will turn, to-morrow I will please God; and all to-day’s and yesterday’s deeds shall be forgiven me.” Thou sayest true: God hath promised pardon to thy conversion; He hath not promised a to-morrow to thy delay.

Today, the rumor spread quickly through the local grapevine that the Man of God, Jesus, had just arrived.
But what sort of conduct is, or should be acceptable when someone controversial passes--both in the hours immediately after the death, while the family mourns, and long after the dirt hardens over the proverbial coffin? Is it ever acceptable to express joy at someone's passing, or to damn them to Hell (or the equivalent in other religious or cultural traditions)? Is "good riddance" and appropriate response? What of no comment at all, or invokation of the wise words of Thumper the rabbit? ("If you can't say sumthin' nice...") Does it make the pain of the surviving family worse to hear public exultations of their loved ones' passing, or does this matter?
But here’s the thing. For the past little while I’ve noticed I’m reading less and less YA fiction. Instead I find I’m grubbing around on my shelves for midgrade fantasy. And it suddenly struck me last night that I am rapidly coming to loathe YA fiction.
Mere age is no signifier of course: the homogeny of the 30s poets was more similar than their sex; it often followed that they had the same education; often the same sexuality; and certainly similar careers and backgrounds. Yet, at the same time I think that if we don't necessarily think of the poets of a particular decade being all born within a few months of each other, there is still something about the poetry of that decade being of and from that time. Though Seamus Heaney or Christopher Reid or John Ashbery still win prizes it would seem a little absurd to include any of them in any "post-2000" poetry anthology - has their best work happened since then? I somehow doubt it, yet they've clearly remained an impact. There's unlikely to be a "poetry of the 00s" now and one kind of thinks that if anything there is a certain uneasy modern poetry that was written before and after the millennium a little uncertain of where it actually stood. Oswald's an interesting example; easily one of the most successful poets of the last few years; yet "a nature poet" - one of the oldest and most popular strands of English writing.

Most interestingly, the text occasions an extended account, unparalleled in Islamic literature in its sympathetic approach, of the mysterious Sabi’ans of Harran.

Here is what the Bible says about Sodom: “Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. They were haughty and did detestable (TOEVAH) things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen.” ( Ezekiel 16:49-50 NIV) These people were engaged in TOEVAH, the detestable idolatrous practices discussed in the essay “Who Were The Sodomites.” This city was filled with idol worshippers who performed the abominable sex acts of the fertility cults. Notice the list of sins here… it does NOT say, “I destroyed them because they were despicable homosexuals.”

sent three angels to bring her back, and when she refused, they promised they would kill 100 of her children every day until she returned. Lilith in turn vowed to destroy human children. Accounts of Lilith as a child-killer seem to be taken directly from the Lamastu legend. She is often described as a winged demoness with sharp talons, who came in the night, primarily to steal away infants and fetuses. Most likely, the Jews assimilated the figure of Lamastu into their tradition, but it's also possible that both myths were inspired by a third figure. While she is often depicted as a terrifying creature, Lilith also had seductive qualities. The ancient Jews believed she would come to men at night as a succubus. They also regarded her as a queen of evil spirits, and made amulets to protect themselves against her. She is a personification of the erotic dreams which trouble men; the suppressed desire for forbidden delights. Charles

The film is Korean, this already means it’s going to be as tragic and depressing as possible. I’ve actually lived in that country so I can tell you, the movie has all of that correct. However, strong storytelling and a surprising sense of empathy, for both the story inside the film and the audience having to experience it with them, carry off the movie in a surprisingly memorable way. You’re not just left going, oh that’s so sad.

When I was sixteen, my mom and I moved back to Michigan. I was in tenth grade by that time and I didn't want to move back. But, when you're sixteen, not emancipated and disabled, you have few choices. So I moved back and settled into an even angrier me. I quickly gained a reputation as "someone you don't want to mess with," that still sticks, even though I am not nearly as angry as I was then. And my relationship with my father came full circle also, as I tried desperately to have a relationship with him, only to be treated as unwanted. Finally, I stopped caring.

Today was particularly difficult. I managed to eat exactly 200 calories, but food came up a lot today. I managed to avoid breakfast by rushing out of the house to volunteer at the courthouse, but temptation was everywhere. The girls I work with insisted I eat something for lunch, but I turned down their offers. None of their foods were “safe”. No vegetables. No fruits. No yogurt. Just foods packed with fat and calories. Philly cheesesteak and French fries; a chef’s salad that would have been safe had it not been for the cheese and a mountain of dressing. Plus, the serving sizes were colossal. I helped Vernita make fruit smoothies, but when she asked me to try a bit to see how it tasted, I refused. then she added sugar and asked if I would taste it again, but I refused once more, knowing that she just added calories. When she poured me a serving, I threw it in the freezer and never looked at it again. I couldn’t count the calories in it, so I couldn’t eat it.

Global warming is the story, but we debate too much on personalities. For all the good Al Gore did with his documentary on global warming, it unfortunately put a political face on the global warming debate. So, the other side had to defeat Al Gore and win. Unfortunately, the story is the planet is heating up and the data is overwhelming. For the former NASA employees who want 100% causal proof, you will never get there, so we cannot put off planning looking for perfection. Already there is sufficient correlated, highly correlated and, in some cases, causal data and the impact of global warming is showing up and will continue to show up. The problem is we cannot wait until the sea encroaches fully on low-lying areas to say see we told you so, as it takes about 15 years to make a difference. We need to act now. That is the story, not the diminishing few who cry foul. We need active and real discussions around the problem and long term solutions. We need the GOP at the table with their ideas. And, we need them to today. That is the context.

And isn’t that just like the thing? So often in life we spend time and energy searching for things that are much closer than we realise.

I understand how these mothers feel. When my girls were still attending school it was not uncommon for me to decide if they were well enough to go to school. There were times when I sent my girls to school even though they did not want to go. For at least one of my children this was damaging, and I am deeply sorry for the times I made her get on the school bus despite her tears. As parents we are inclined to give in to the power and control of the school system. We are made to think that it is our duty and responsibility to make our children go to school. We end up believing that it is in our children's best interest to get on that bus. We stop listening to our inner wisdom and we stop listening to our children.

As a result of these changes, along with President Bush’s across-the-board cuts in income tax rates, federal taxes as a share of household income fell for the top 1 percent. Over all, the Bush tax cuts were the largest — not only in dollar terms but also as a percentage of income — for high-income households and increased the concentration of after-tax income at the top. Far from curbing escalating inequality, the Bush tax cuts exacerbated the problem.
Michalko: What I learned from observing and listening to academics in college was their curious tendency to assimilate new information into their pre-existing views. Their mental image of the established view interferes with their perception and understanding of new ideas and concepts. In the case of real life, physicists could not see Einstein’s theory of relativity because of their established, accepted view. For years, they tried to incorporate his view into the established view without success.

I hadn't been quite sure what to expect: the Occupy movement has common global and local concerns, as well as numerous specific local ones. It is a dynamic phenomenon, still evolving. By the time of this rally, it had established itself as a real force, but was also facing a moment of decision if not crisis: how to respond to both the onset of harsher weather and harsher police actions. Certainly, such a movement takes on different contours in a metropolis such as New York or Boston vs. a small rural college town such as Amherst.
The term 'Benefit' is taken literally by the contrived underclass. In a sane society, the genuinely vulnerable would be cared for, and the unscrupulous spongers would be forced to provide for themselves or to perish. We have a moral duty to look after the weaker members of society such as the infirm and disabled, but we have no duty to look after those who are irresponsible and think that they are somehow better than the rest of us and that we owe them a living.

We don't have any sugar. We don't have chocolate chips or self-rising flour or yeast or anything I need for baking. Last night I was struck by a sudden need to bake something. Cookies or cupcakes or something sweet and I couldn't do it. Yes, I know, the last thing I need to do is bake up a batch of cookies or cupcakes when there are only two of us to eat them, but sometimes it's about making them rather than eating them. Not for long, but initially it is. We got some Bisquick at Sam's Club, so I can make some pancakes, but I can't make chocolate chip pancakes. And we only have a few bottles of spices. I want to bake some bread or something, but it's just such a pain to get everything together when you aren't starting with some of it in the cupboards.

But the English really do know how to make a sausage! Dull people sometimes make fatuous remarks about what parts of the animal are inside those clear casings, but I don’t have a lot of time for squeamish bores. When there are sausages, don’t think, eat! Sausages are heavily seasoned, have good flavour and these days can be made out of all sorts of exotic meats. I have to say that pork still beats the others into a cocked hat. I have cooked venison sausages (dry – v overpowering flavour) Chicken sausages (pale and unappetising looking, with a moussy texture, but popular with kids) lamb and mint sausages (strong flavour – rather fatty). Chipolatas (the small, slim pork sausages) are good slathered with some marmalade, baked in the oven and served on sticks at parties. They literally vanish. A bit of grainy mustard and honey drizzled over them before cooking is another delicious alternative. Boring old mashed potato can be revved up with a bit of garlic or chopped herbs for colour. There are many ways to enjoy a sausage, but none so excellent and so correct to celebrate St George’s day, than the Toad in the Hole.
Of course I.Q. tests have been attacked, especially by those who perform badly at them, as one might expect them to do. Detractors claim cultural bias, dysfunctional families, past oppression, poor schooling and a host of other reasons for poor black performance, but the professors defend their contention that I.Q. is largely an inherited trait; that differences are inherent, built into a person’s inherited DNA.
Long-termers tell me it's a rite of passage up here, and I must say, I am surprisingly more relaxed about it than I thought I would be. I'm fine, my pup is fine. That's all I really care about.
Hey girls,
Strange Happenings is the first anthology coming out soon. All of the short stories in that one are done by me. It’s going to be quasi science-fiction. Science definitely has an impact on all of the short stories but it’s not the typical science-fiction that most people expect (outer space, ray guns, futuristic, etc.). Hopefully this one will be out by early July (or perhaps a little earlier).

Fear. Fear for being out of the norm. It’s pathetic. Fear to not fit in. Fear put in our heads by these “leaders” to ensure we’re docile. Contained, content with the safety they provide. The world around us establishes the norm, and like fucking lemmings running full boar off a cliff, following that first stupid little fucker to have an “accident” just go along with it. It’s not fair to anyone. I mean who gives a fuck how fucking destroyed our future gets in the name of commercialism when some stupid little fictional number called a “credit score” is way more important for you to get the shit that you want right now. Instant gratification. The biggest high anyone can get. Getting something nice. Spending money.
Rich had been in a motorcycle accident over 25 years ago. He should have, but did not seek medical attention. He is very much regretting that now. To make a long story short, he sustained a head and back injury that over the years has been debilitating. He suffers from severe headaches, back pain and convulsions. He has long term memory but not short term. He has a depressed skull fracture, where the bone is pressing on his brain. Fragments have been coming apart. About a year ago he needed a cane, and on bad days a walker. He spends most of his days now either in bed or in a wheelchair. He has often wished to die because he cannot take the pain any more. He and his wife Sue have gone to many doctors and have seen two neurologists. Rich needs surgery on his back and on his skull. He needs a metal plate. I'm a little unclear as to why the neurologists won't help him, but it boils down to money, which Rich and Sue don't have. The last neurologist won't even give them the results of tests taken because they claim they haven't been paid in full.
Ask any member of the church why, and they’ll likely respond with something similar to the following:
I read that Apple has invested millions designing a pair of unibody earbuds. What difference it will make remains to be seen, as the current set offered with their iPods are notoriously bad. A friend of mine showed me the new cans he’d picked up over the weekend – a pair of Bose AE2 headphones. This is already the third pair of headphones he’s bought in something like a year. The last set he showed me were the Bang & Olufsen, what the company itself bills as high-tech jewelry. The Bose sounded better than most of what’s offered around here, and they are reassuringly sober-looking compared to the fashion accessory headsets seen everywhere nowadays. But their sound didn’t really blow me away or anything – vocals seemed subdued, and bass was wanting. Also, as they aren’t noise-cancelling headphones, they must be played at loud volumes to drown out outside noise, and Korea is one of the noisiest places on earth. I needed a new set of headphones, preferably something I could use when shooting video and for listening to music on my computer. So they had to be portable. I checked out the recommendations over at headphoneinfo.com, the most objective site on the Net. For under $100, the Etymotic Mc5 earbuds fit the bill: a fairly flat frequency response up until around 10,000 hz, inaudible distortion, 32 decibels of isolation, and great tracking. I just worried because I prefer the comfort of headband style headphones. Now that I’ve used them and listened to everything from Jay-Z and the Police to Lester Bowie and Beethoven, I can say their reputation is justified. My only complaint is they must be jammed into your skull pretty tight in order to obtain the best sound, especially the bass. This morning another friend wanted to compare the Mc5s to the AE2s. He plugged the Bose into his Galaxy Note, listening for at least ten minutes. I asked if he wasn’t going to try out the Etymotics. He put them on for a few seconds, then without a word, yanked them out. Shoving silicone tips all the way into your ear canal isn’t for everyone, no matter how good they sound!

Like most teachers of his time, the maulvi who taught Mirza and Sahibañ was a stickler for pedagogical rules, and his golden rule was: Spare the rod and spoil the child. As a tool of punishment, he used what in Punjabi is called a chhammak. It is a long, thin, green twig or branch of a tree, shorn of the leaves or any thorns. When struck on any part of the body it sends a flaming sensation through the body — and the soul, too, I guess.

But let me remind you that the willingness to engage in dreams and visions is spiritual battle. God uses it for life and to turn us toward obedience. But the enemy desires that our body would perish. This is a very real spiritual battle that we see summarized in Proverbs 29:19. The proverbs, in general, are a rooting and grounding in frustrating your own will. Surrender to God! The writers of the Proverbs call out to us, “Recognize the battle for your soul, my son. Life is deeper than the surface noise!”

Then it occurred to me that a common theme in all those meals was the salad. There was always a salad of some sort, served on a moon shaped plate. We never had the same salad twice, I'm pretty sure, but the point of them was always the same: to provide a crunchy, fresh, almost discreet relief from the fireworks in the main, round, plates.

He shook a plastic produce bag, struggling to get it open. His veined hands trembled. I wanted to know how this story–Elderly Man Navigates the Grocery Store–would end. Thoughts of him and his wife swirled in with my mental grocery list. Where was his wife? Greek yogurt. Had she died? Whole wheat or french bread? Was she sick at home? Shoot, forgot the carrots for mushroom barley soup. Was she no longer mobile? We’re almost out of string cheese. Did his wife sit by the swimming pool in a yellow polka dot bikini a long time ago? Jumbo brown eggs versus cage-free white. Does she continue to sunbathe in his mind?

They assured me I could put out bags of trash this once and they would pick them up. So, I lugged everything out on Wednesday morning and went to work. Wednesday night... the damn trash is still there. I called Thursday morning and they claimed I didn't have it out early enough but they would accommodate my "mistake" and make another trip on Thursday to pick it up.

Backstory: The Joseph brothers came to this country from their native Haiti and have been business and property owners for over 26 years. Two weeks ago, they were informed that their building on South Oxford Street in Fort Greene, Brooklyn could not legally house their business - F + S Tire Shop. While tires were changed on the South Oxford corner (for nearly three decades), the brownstone neighborhood has improved around F + S. Crime has been pushed out, and the downtown Brooklyn location is once again prime real estate.
The industrialized approach to agriculture and natural resource management—which includes specialization, standardization, and consolidation in pursuit of increased efficiency—has disconnected rural communities from the larger economy. At the same time, societal demands for protection and enhancement of rural communities’ key assets (their natural resources) has led to more stringent regulations affecting production.
HAPPY MOTHERS DAY!
Eventually, the summer came to an end. My supervisor told me to leave her my business card, and she’d try to find a way to get it to Will without seeming obvious. Turns out, he asked her about me, and she gave him my card. He emailed me, and we ended up having an on and off relationship for the next seven years. Whenever neither of us was involved with anyone else, we’d get together. It’s always good to have a back-up plan!
Not only did I let my own thinking defeat me, I had dream-killers in my family. Family members, very close ones who would tell me “Why do you even like stuff like that?” or “You’re strange. What’s the point of doing something like that?” or “I’ll never understand you.” Being told that I was strange and that I didn’t make sense was a confidence killer. If my own family thought I didn’t make sense…why would anyone else? This type of thinking has pervaded my life since childhood. For example, when I was in middle school, I was one of the best volley ball servers in my grade. I was told this by peers and P.E. coaches. Did I try out for volleyball? Of course not! Why would I do something as ambitious as that? In my mind, it went something like “*scoffing* You aren’t popular, you’re overweight, you’re one of the geeks. Why would anybody want to see you diving for a volleyball?”. What I didn’t know then, nattygeeks, was that I had zero confidence. I was so used to this way of thinking that I did not know that it wasn’t normal. That way of thinking followed me to high school where I was faced with so many opportunities…that I let pass me by. I was fairly intelligent. I didn’t think so though, I was just doing what you were supposed to do. You were supposed to go to class, do your homework, make good grades. So why were people praising me? Don’t give me credit for doing things that were supposed to be normal. I didn’t feel like that made me special. However, it did. I ended up making the highest score on the PSATs in my class…which dumbfounded me. I alone was a National Merit Semi-finalist at my school. Most kids would’ve celebrated, right? Did everything in their power to continue to succeed. What did I do? I became overwhelmed and depressed. Why should I have all this attention? Why, me? Surely, there are smarter people here. Surely my score was a fluke. I retreated so deep into myself that any type of praise made me overwhelmed. I didn’t go on to the Finalist competition because I wasn’t confident enough to write the essay required or go and take the SATs. Doubt and worry destroyed my confidence along with the confidence killers in my family. The pattern continued throughout my life. It dances in the back of my mind as I’m writing this. Something is changing in me though.

The most egregious variants of these methods are displayed by ex Panther, ex CP member Angela Davis who, for all her experience offers no program other than self-actualization platitudes from author June Jordan, by Michael Moore who evokes the moral imperative against “capitalist greed”, by the ISO which in San Francisco has endorsed anti-working class proposition C and which freely distributes “tax the rich” posters. The ISO at least should have read the 1938 Transitional Program of the Fourth International which develops a program of transitional demands designed to guide workers to take production into the hands of the working class.

If new industries and new residents with income are going to take a chance on cities that can’t offer what cities on the rise can, it will take something dramatic to attract them. However, this scale of public goods can’t be afforded by cities on their own – it needs support from state and Federal government. With loans, revenue-sharing to support new services, and Federalization of existing social services, Federal and state governments help shape the entire course of urban development.

The Princess Bride is such a good film because it's both a parody of the classic love-story/fairy-tale, and yet also a simple re-imagining of it. The story, like so many other fairy-tale romances, begins as such: Buttercup is a beautiful girl whose parents own a small farm in the countryside of Florin and Westley is a farm boy who works for them. Buttercup's favorite pastime is ordering Westely around, to which Westley always replies "As you wish.", a sign of his affection, and obliges Buttercup happily. The two eventually fall deeply in love, but in order to get money to be married, Westley goes off to find a job and start a life for them. But then Buttercup hears of Westley's death by pirates and she suddenly finds herself whisked away by Prince Humperdinck, who is resolved to make her his bride. As the nuptials near, Buttercup is kidnapped by three outlaws--Vizzini, Fezzik, and Inigo Montoya who are hired to kill the Princess and start a war with Florin. Buttercup is then saved by the Dread Pirate Roberts who later reveals himself to be Westley who happened to escape death. But Buttercup is taken once again right as she and Wesley are reunited by the ruthless Prince Humperdinck. The Prince then orders torture upon Westley so as to keep him away from Buttercup, but Westley ends up being saved by Fezzik and Inigo, who in turn risk life and limb to help him save Buttercup.

The cast have been working very hard. A nasty task-master am I and we have had a few weeks without coffee breaks when they have been constantly on the go and running off pleadingly for a brief toilet break. Oh, but they are doing themselves proud. With a few more hours of rehearsals…… And the leading lights have really stepped up the pace and the quality – suddenly, at our last rehearsal before Holy Week, they gave performances that were almost opening night standard. And we all know that there will be so much more to come from them once the lights shine on their faces making the make-up drip down their costumes. Lovely.

As chest pain is an important indicator of heart diseases, therefore it also essential to control risk factors like smoking, excessive weight gain and the level of blood cholesterol, which can increase the risk of coronary heart diseases.
You treated your conscience to a dose of guilt and then prayed to someone or other that things would stay the way they were as long as they could. That’s where you went wrong. You should have held fast to your Western contempt. It might have steeled you against disaster. Because that’s what’s brewing for you now, my friend, and you can’t do anything about it. When all is said and done, it will serve you right, and no one will stand up and fight it. Not even your own. Which just goes to show what a decadent lot you really are.
A brief stop at the Visitors’ Centre atLullingstone Country Park, then onwards, not though the country park itself – which boasts of extensive chalk grassland and an impressive collection of veteran trees in its woodland (if I’d known this before setting out, I would have planned a different route!) – but continuing along the Darent Valley Path. Leaving the river as it veers southeastwards, a permissive path across Castle Farm allows me to avoid the tarmac and traffic (what little there is of it) of Castle Road. Instead, my route continues along the grassy buffer strip at the edge of a field of lavender, narrow purple-grey rows climbing the hillside like contour lines on a map.

In order to be successful at this, I feel I need to know what I'm talking about. No point in telling someone, "Swap out white rice for quinoa, it's much healthier for you" if I've never eaten quinoa myself. What if it's utterly disgusting? What if it has an essence of cardboard and sweaty socks? Is that fair to recommend that to my clients? And if it is a super ingredient, wouldn't it be my job to be able recommend a tasty way to prepare it? Yes. Overall I think people know what they should eat, it's the challenge of making it palatable that they have trouble with.
But I have really whittled down my list. For the most part, I find that too many blogs, no matter how adorable or fashionable or creative or popular or absolutely wonderful they may be......they are in no way contributing to a better lifestyle for me. What I get out of them is that I am not doing enough crafts, throwing enough parties with all my fancy friends, wearing a new outfit in every photo I take of myself, dressing my kids adorably enough, wearing my hair pretty enough and making a tutorial of how I made it so impossibly pretty, living in a fancy enough house, organizing every corner of my life, hand making paper for handmade invitations for a handmade birthday party for my baby that isn't born yet, etc. etc. etc.
