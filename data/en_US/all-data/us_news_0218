They all gathered for pictures Tuesday night on the court afterward, father and son, mother and daughter. A March Norman Rockwell scene.
Director Lee Tamahori ("Die Another Day") has made a kind of retro-homage to '80s bad behavior and hangers-on -- let's all do mounds of coke, wear shiny clothes and go party at the disco with Uday; if we're lucky he'll rape or shoot one of us.

Actions, as we all know, speak louder. At work this week, the in-basket for Elway was filled with a trip to take a first-hand look at Oklahoma State quarterback Brandon Weeden, followed by a chummy comparison of Super Bowl rings with Manning.
"I don't know how it happened to tell you the truth," Stricker said. "To win it once was nice and special and I think the second time was a little bit of a joke. I guess what I've always said is that shows you how far down in a hole I was to win it twice."
The 21-year-old actress, an Oscar nominee for the Missouri-lensed indie "Winter's Bone," overcame concerns about her age and blondeness to score the coveted role of Katniss Everdeen, a reluctant teen contestant on a kill-or-be-killed reality show in the fascist future.

On Trevor, in the hospital down the hall from her:
The members of the committee were made up of an equal cross-section of our three cities, with a parent and staff member from each city (all live in the district and are also graduates of our schools), a representative from each alumni association, and historical representation. The committee spent many hours looking at all the possibilities, with the goal of making sure that the name signified the equal partnership of the two high schools merging and the equal importance of the three cities that make up our district. We appreciate all their hard work and thoughtful deliberations, and we now look forward to having the students from our two high schools select the new mascot. We are grateful for everyone’s support as we move forward with our transitional activities.
“The ebbs and flows of performance and health and stuff are a part of anybody’s career,” he said. “So, thankfully this is nothing serious and we’ll get him going again.”

Wayne has "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon," "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" and "Stagecoach"; while Eastwood has "Unforgiven," "The Good, the Bad & the Ugly" and "High Plains Drifter." All classic westerns. And both have a handful of solid additional entries.

Hey, @MICHIGANvsOSU: This isn't going to be a great recruiting season for Ohio State, but whether Michigan, specifically, can capitalize is the most interesting recruiting question at hand. The Wolverines have 18 oral commits so far, seven from Ohio, while Ohio State has nine oral commits, all from Ohio. It's understandable that Ohio State is going to have trouble recruiting out of state during these turbulent times, but that should rebound when coaching stability returns at the end of this season.

Moyer continues to defy logic at age 49 but he did stumble a bit last Sunday, when he was touched for four runs and 11 hits over five innings in a no decision. That snapped a string of three straight starts allowing two earned runs or less. Moyer is 6-10 with a 5.08 ERA in 19 career games - 17 starts - against Atlanta. Brian McCann is 10-for-28 with a homer and nine RBIs while Jones has gone 9-for-27 with a homer and four doubles off Moyer.
Records in the Summit County Recorder's Office show the Internal Revenue Service placed two liens in 2010 on Hayes' nearly $1 million dollar home in Richfield. The IRS filed a $219,241 lien in August for unpaid 2008 taxes. It filed a second lien for $72,930 in December for unpaid 2009 taxes. It's unclear how much money, if any, Hayes has paid toward the liens because Hayes refused to answer questions.

Reliever Mitchell Boggs is fully participating in camp activities after struggling with back issues for much of last season.
As the Orioles sought to update Camden Yards, they heeded Rosentraub's advice.

Rory Juhn, Henry Hvizdos and Jon Krabil captured a first in the high jump relay with Juhn establishing a personal best effort of 6-4. The Fairview boys were meet champions at the Division II level with 59 points, while the Lady Warriors were third overall in Division II with 31 points.
San Francisco is the only jurisdiction in the state that charged that tax, a big bill for any company in the city that goes public, as both Yelp and social gaming giant Zynga recently have.
“We actually love each other,” he says, his voice suddenly soft. “The secret is that simple. That we love each other but also that we are not trying to replay that first love. That first moment, those first six months or whatever, I think sometimes marriages break up because the people have lost that initial feeling and they panic. They do not realize that you need to calm down. You need to breathe. And suddenly something new appears which you did not expect.”

Democrats are dismayed; Republicans are encouraged. But let's consider the larger picture.
In 2009 the Audubon Society worked with city staff, local residents and the planning commission to develop code revisions to help Troutdale meet its obligations under Title 13. Rather than adopt these very modest changes, the City Council disregarded the hard work and considerable public input and voted to permanently table the staff proposal. The council then proceeded to do nothing for almost two years as the compliance extensions ran out. In the meanwhile, new houses were built in the floodplain along lower Beaver Creek near the Sandy River, displacing streamside habitat and putting life and property at greater risk from future floods.

There are just a couple of pointers to consider when cooking with ground nuts. First, the point is to grind them only until they resemble coarse breadcrumbs, not reduce them to peanut butter. A food processor (use the pulse setting) is ideal for this. In a pinch, you can do it by hand with a large knife on the cutting board.
A funeral service will be held at 11 a.m. today at Congregation Temple Israel in Creve Coeur, with interment at Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery.

"The goal of improved service to the community is easily defined, but the process to achieve that goal is admittedly difficult. We have to stay focused on the goal and ensure that support is provided to the process.”
With regard to the underlying issue of gay marriage itself, what harm could possibly come to Ms. Campbell from the lawful marital union of two women or two men? Does same-sex marriage invalidate Ms. Campbell's own marriage in any way? Ms. Campbell must know that our neighboring country, Canada, found no detrimental effect on heterosexual marriage when many years ago gay people were given the right to marry whom they chose. Why is Ms. Campbell so willing to punish millions of tax-paying, law-abiding, fully contributing gay Americans by denying them access to the 1400 legal benefits that automatically go to married couples in the United States?
They were fast-paced, with different timed drills and sessions to mimic the format Manning will soon do with his new NFL team. It was that type of practice that Broncos officials watched when they traveled to North Carolina to watch Manning nearly two weeks ago.
It's no wonder, then, that when the Patriots took a knee at the end of the game, Umenyiora shook hands with tight end Ben Watson and guard Logan Mankins while Light, who was lined up between the two, simply walked back to the huddle.

Each of the eight places left in the contest now is also going to be visited by teams of Plain Dealer and cleveland.com judges. Those panels -- not online votes -- will send four restaurants through to the Final Formaggio. Then it will come down to the ultimate taste test. Five judges -- Cavs great Campy Russell, chocolatier Dan Malley, The Plain Dealer's Michael Heaton and two readers -- will try pizzas from the chosen four. Their decision will produce the top winner for the whole area.
Precision Castparts' work is state-of-the-art, too. But the surprise in touring one of the company's Milwaukie plants is how many parts are essentially handmade, albeit to exacting tolerances.

The new and higher fees come as a regulation that took effect this month cut the average fees that merchants pay for debit transactions to about 24 cents from 44 cents. In addition, federal rules that have reined in overdraft fees have cost banks billions of dollars, which they are trying to make up in more-direct consumer charges.
At a time like this, no hotel manager in his right mind would add a new surcharge. If anything, they'd remove them to make us happy. "Upsetting guests is not worth it," says Robert Mandelbaum, a PKF analyst.

Columbus -- Ohio fought hard against other states to win this $400 million award in order to create jobs and economic opportunity in our state. Because so much incomplete and inaccurate information has developed around this project, it's important to separate myths from facts:

As of today, Kony 2012 had racked up more than 76 million views on YouTube – an enormous accomplishment for a video launched a bit more than a week ago. The reason I hadn’t watched it until this morning is because, almost immediately following its launch, a media backlash started, accusing Russell and Invisible Children of exaggerating facts, misrepresenting current realities, and failing to allocate sufficient donated monies to helping the children they purport to serve. Disgusted by what I perceived as “nothing being simple or straightforward anymore,” as I complained to my Facebook friends, I simply avoided it as another “cause of the moment.” Until this morning, when curiosity got the best of me.
Inconsistency. Hypocrisy. More leniency for violence than sex. These are the hallmarks of the MPAA ratings process.

It's like crawling and then someone throwing you onto a bicycle and telling you you've got to ride."
Sports franchises do best when they are a reflection of their community. Seattle loves its hip and trendy. The Sounders' Rave Green uniforms suit its fan base. L.A. loves its stars.

In Tustin, it is no different.

"He was much better than me," said the 25th-seeded del Potro, a semifinalist in Paris two years ago. "He has everything; everything perfect. He has very good movement. He's very fast. He's improved his serve. He's beating all the players very, very easy, and I'm one more victim of his game."

Guardianship does not only apply to children. A guardian is also needed when a person cannot manage his or her own affairs or care for himself/herself because of a mental or physical condition. Along with your basic estate planning such as a Last Will and Testament or a Trust every adult over the age of 18 should have a current Durable Power of Attorney for Assets, a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care and a Living Will. These documents ensure that if you should become incapacitated, even temporarily, the person of your choosing will manage your assets and your health care decisions without court interference. Without Powers of Attorney, your family (even your spouse) and friends must apply to a court and endure a Guardianship proceeding before a judge. This can be time consuming, possibly expensive and could cause friction among family members.

This year, Memorial Day weekend - my kickoff to the grilling season - was spent in Santa Barbara. Having rented a house with family complete with a gigantic grill, we decided to "live the tri-tip lifestyle." Ever the cook in charge, all my efforts went into creating an expertly cooked hunk of meat. I dry-rubbed, I flipped; I poked and prodded. And with all of my attention to the main course, my gorgeous array of vibrantly colored vegetables - purchased fresh that morning at the Santa Barbara farmers' market - singed to a crisp.

In a simple menu, I could opt to back up the Windows PC to my MacBook as well as to remote servers—or just to the MacBook alone. On my MacBook, I made sure to adjust the settings to get the fastest speed possible for my giant backup.

scared. As the Super Bowl pressed on and the Giants pass rush intensified, Brady's dropback became sloppier, his patience shorter and his feet happier. The Giants were inside his head especially after Justin Tuck sacked him. The Giants pulled up a chair, popped a six-pack and began rummaging through every neuron that wasn't nailed down like gremlins on a sugar high. This was both Brady's finest moment and his worst. The same could be said for Patriots coach Bill Belichick. Both are among the best in history. Both have forgotten more about their craft than most will ever know but there is no question about the following: their impressive legacies take a hit. A pretty good sized one, too. There are some already reassessing the Patriots legacy. Noting that the Patriots haven't won a Super Bowl since the Spygate scandal, Pittsburgh linebacker James Harrison tweeted just minutes after the game: ‘Told you, cheaters never win!!!!!!!!!'"

Additionally, safety net programs must be retained, including PAAD and Senior Gold. Many low- and middle-income residents depend on these programs to help pay for their prescriptions.

Auerbach's Cello Sonata, written 10 years ago, emerged as a characteristically impassioned utterance, full of urgent phrasing and sharp delineations between the two instruments.

Apparently, for these sportsmen, the game isn't dangerous enough, the risk of injury too low.

Frankly, the Internal Revenue Service has generally cut clergy too much slack when pastors and preachers become engaged in what certainly seems to be overtly partisan activity. It is important, though, to remember that in general the IRS is not required to disclose the resolution of every case it investigates. The public usually learns the result when the church under scrutiny itself reveals the result of IRS inquiries.

Romney has criticized the Times' simplistic headline for suggesting -- erroneously, he insists -- that he would have stood still for the liquidation of Michigan's manufacturing base. But it's hard to know how GM and Chrysler would be alive today if the then-President George Bush had followed Romney's advice not to authorize any direct federal aid to the automakers, or if Bush's successor had been reluctant to provide debtor-in-possession financing for the quick-rinse bankruptcy that ensued.

Under the age of 30, these discs are normally soft, and they act as cushions for the vertebrae. With age, the material in these lumbar discs becomes less flexible and the disks begin to erode, losing some of their height. As their thickness decreases, their ability to act as a cushion lessens. The less dense cushion now alters the position of the vertebrae and the ligaments that connect them. In some cases, the loss of density can even cause the vertebra to shift their positions. As the vertebrae shift and affect the other bones, the nerves can get caught or pinched and muscle spasms can occur.
—Recruiting. With talent along the West Coast in a downward spiral—ironically, there’ve been more McDonald’s All-Americans from Canada (five) in the past three seasons than from California (two)—UCLA was slow to react to the need to take its brand on the road. That happened in 2011, however, when Howland hired Atlanta-based Korey McCray as an assistant. McCray has experience in junior college and “AAU” basketball; he helped connect the Bruins to promising wing Jordan Adams, who signed in November, and low-post force Tony Parker, whom the Bruins still are pursuing along with Memphis, Ohio State, Kentucky Kansas, Duke, Georgetown and Georgia.

There was no better showcase for the rugged 6-foot-3 wing than the SIHSL tournament. Richmond displayed why he was so important to Curtis for three seasons.

Most importantly, he finished games strong, leading the Warriors to their second Island crown in three years.
As creator of the first flat suitcase, Vuitton was hailed as an inventor as he proceeded to supply the "new rich" with traveling cases, as many of them spent their money traveling aboard the very things that had made them rich—the railways. A reproduction of part of Vuitton's first commercial catalog from 1892 for his stores in Paris and London, inserted in the book of the exhibition (and available at louisvuitton.com) illustrates the breadth of his offerings and the level of customer demand. The list includes leather-covered trunks, ladies' trunks, gentlemen's trunks, steamer trunks, special trunks for India, camp-bed trunks, "Gladstone" bags, "Never Full" bags, gentlemen's dress-suit cases and so on. A page of the catalog reads: "Louis Vuitton begs his customers to read his catalog with attention, and in case they should not find what they wish, to kindly note their requirements to him and special plans et [sic] models shall be made for them free of charge."

Wondrich adds, "It was not entirely a disinterested development on the bartenders' part, though -- it was the style, at the time, to make drinks with "sprezzatura", to appear to expend the minimum effort possible, and since proper stirring involves only the muscles of the wrist, this was the dominant technique."
"I love you all. This isn't your fault," Marissa wrote in a spiral-bound notebook Milligan found in Marissa's room, sandwiched on her armoire between "Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul'' and "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens."

The wonderful folks at Aardman ("Chicken Run," "Wallace & Gromit") have created another deliriously silly stop-motion animation delight, filled with giddy pleasures and so many witty details flying by that you wish for a pause button. The "Pirate of the Year" application is whisked away quickly, but we get a glance at some of the questions? Was the booty acquired by exciting adventure, a beauty contest, or perhaps in exchange for bonds? And what is the quality of the beard?

Even if we had walked out that day and paid $8,900, I think I would be embarrassed by it, and I definitely would have lost/chipped/shattered it. It was stunning, but it wasn't me, and it certainly wasn't us. An engagement ring is a declaration of I WANT YOU, not I WANT YOUR FRIENDS TO KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY I MAKE, and a ring that size might indicate the latter.

Home Improvement, of course, was the long-running sitcom starring Tim Allen as a home-repair specialist with his own television show. Richard Karn played Al Borland, his caution-urging assistant.

The rules also would prevent those younger than 18 from working in feed lots, grain bins and stockyards.

But, as the Washington Times pointed out, wealthy individuals were able to make unlimited independent expenditures on political advertising long before Citizens United.

Barry, you have been arguing that the sky will fall if pastors are allowed to speak freely.

Sometimes they did so during very contentious elections. What is plainly evident during that time is that churches didn't turn into political machines and the republic didn't fall apart. Barry, the weight of history is against you and the IRS.
