Of the extra earnings, $21,099 came by working double time. Under a union contract, the county must pay deputies twice their normal earnings if they work a seventh consecutive day, meaning they will start their normal work week without a day off. Working the first day off would earn overtime, the second double-time.

"The Closer" (9 p.m. Monday, July 11, TNT): Kyra Sedgwick, who took home the lead actress for a drama Emmy in August, begins her seventh and final season as deputy police chief Brenda Leigh Johnson. A civil lawsuit, a major departmental reorganization, a new boss and an unexpected tragedy are among the tough issues facing Brenda and the Los Angeles Police Department's Major Crimes unit. This last season will see Brenda facing the consequences of her unorthodox, sometimes-questionable methods -- tactics that draw the attention of the department's new chief of police.

Also Wednesday, the PDC board will get an update on its Centennial Mills redevelopment project.
Right before the year started, we walked to the school together so we could get our school schedules. While there I made a couple of friends and they offered me a ride home. I told them I came with my friend and asked if he could get a ride, too. They took one look at him and said there was no room (there was). I should have said, "No, thank you," and left with my friend. But I didn't. I asked him if it was okay if I went with them and he said yes, but I could tell his feeling were hurt. I chose to go with my new friends.

There are two things each player said they haven't forgotten.
With four games to go, you have to ask if SLU can win out. You can't rule it out, since SLU's next two games, against Fordham and Rhode Island, are against the two worst teams in the league. Then they get a Xavier team they beat on the road at home, and then close at Duquesne, who they've already beaten by 27. So yes, it's very possible. Xavier may be desperate for a win when it hits town, and going on the road is always tough, not to mention the fact the A-10 has been unpredictable this season, so the final two games will be challenging.

Some critics have worried that a glut of incubators are pumping out too many startups with ideas that are too small. But if there was any ambivalence on the part of potential investors, it seemed to be more than balanced out by the fact that they felt they couldn't afford to miss this day.
At Wednesday's meeting, Commissioner Randy Leonard, who oversees the Water Bureau, complained that the proposed water increase isn't enough to enable the city to buy an 11-acre patch of land owned by the Oregonian Publishing Co. in Northwest Portland for use as an emergency staging area. The city wants to buy property -- paid for from water fees -- to use for equipment and services in the event that an earthquake or other catastrophe cuts the city's west side off from the Bull Run water supply.

There was a lot to like in Debussy's "La Mer" and Ravel's "La Valse" on the first half. They are the works (along with Ravel's "Mother Goose") on the orchestra's just-released first DG recording. Chung has a close connection with France (he had a stint at the Paris Opera and has been music director of Radio France's orchestra for a dozen years). He became close to Messiaen during the composer's final years, and Chung was also the first to conduct Pierre Boulez's "Notations" at the L.A. Phil.
The tone of the race is just one sign of the continuing rightward drift of politics in one of the most conservative states. With nearly 50 percent of Texas voters calling themselves "very conservative" in a recent poll, the competition in the GOP is now all about who's the purest and most doctrinaire. And longtime officeholders who rose in an earlier time can find themselves held up against the new breed of hard-liners who brook no compromise with the opposition.
"We have to get Hispanic voters to vote for our party," Romney told a private fundraiser in Florida on Sunday in which he insisted the GOP needs an alternative to the Dream Act.
‘‘Anthony's never been a cocky person,'' said 6-5 Louisville freshman Wayne Blackshear, another McDonald's All-American from Chicago. ‘‘I've known him since we were in fifth grade. I never thought he'd grow this tall. But he had his growth spurt and became an elite player.''
Wells Fargo is the company's largest creditor and has first rights to the mill and Blue Heron's assets.

"Dock took me in hand as a young man and taught me how to pitch and helped my growth as a person," said Demery, who lives in Bakersfield.
"You have to be careful with your bullpen," he said. "Sometimes, you're playing great defense and you see the pitcher hitting and you relax a little less. It's a different ballgame. You're talking about more pitching. The American League has good pitching, but the offense is much stronger than in the National League. But it's a way different baseball game."

Berkshire paid $26.5 billion in 2010 for the 77.5 percent of the railroad it didn't already own. Buffett is "on the prowl" for large acquisitions after record earnings at Berkshire's railroad and energy units helped boost the company's cash hoard to $37.3 billion at the end of 2011, the billionaire investor said in a letter to shareholders in February.

If we consider the number of children born in the U.S. in 2010 (4.05 million), allocate Maryland's proportional share of those births (1.87 percent) and weigh those figures in light of the newly revised autism prevalence rate as determined by theU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventionof one child in 88 births, approximately 16 children will be born in Maryland each week — 832 each year — who will eventually be diagnosed with autism using the existing diagnostic criteria. These children will join the thousands who have already been diagnosed and who will not be afforded coverage for critical early intervention services through their health insurers — therapies that are mandated by legislation in 30 other states to be covered by insurers.
During their 1974 tour of South Africa, the British & Irish Lions were not going to be intimidated _ in fact, quite the reverse. When a player was targeted by the Springboks, he would shout "99," a call to arms for Lions players, triggering a mass retaliation by his teammates. The Lions' thought process: "If the referee sends one of us off, he'll have to send all of us off." It worked. In one of the most violent rugby matches ever _ later christened "The Battle of Boet Erasmus" _ there is famous footage of Lions full-back JPR Williams running halfway down the field to launch himself at Johannes van Heerden. There were scuffles all over the field, sparked by the "99" call.

She died at age 24, and her last words were reported to be, “Jesus, I love you.” According to legend, witnesses, including two Jesuits and many Indians, said the scars on her face suddenly disappeared after her death.
Jenkins advocates such a system. He would ask frequent fliers and others who fly several times a year to voluntarily register and undergo background checks. That information would be combined with other data already collected, including their flying histories, but not race or nationality, to create different levels of scrutiny.

Nope. Seacrest asked David Cook to trade places with Syesha Mercado, and there stood the bottom three: Kristy Lee, Brooke and Syesha. Considering that the judges were cool to Brooke's version of "Hero" on Tuesday night's show -- devoted to Mariah Carey tunes -- many fans were expecting White to go Wednesday night. After Seacrest said Mercado was safe, it seemed Brooke was about to get the heave-ho. After all, Kristy Lee's version of "Forever" had impressed Paula, though Randy and Simon weren't overwhelmed.

Like they did nearly every day during the summer of 1969, the seniors-to-be on the Woodrow Wilson varsity team played pickup ball in the playgrounds along Federal Street. Young 26-year-old coach Gary Williams — who went on to coach Maryland to an NCAA title — had a talented group, with two good guards (Derek Brown and Tyrone Medley) and two good forwards (Mike Racobaldo and Barry Smith). They had one problem: They didn’t have a center.

Unfortunately, the staging by Santiago-Hudson (a wonderful actor) is mostly a sluggish mess of melodramatic thesping and mediocre design that rarely permits the play's sensitive truths to flower amid its windy excesses. Let's skip the gory details, but there's no sense of family among the actors, whose uncoordinated performances are distractingly amateur in some cases. For all of the fashion quirks on view, the actors' general attitudes don't reflect the periods in which the characters exist.
All us South Countians should wonder what is happening to the heart of South County. A bar that just opened recently closed. A Chevrolet dealership is closed. Most of the shopping area around Kmart is closed down. The Dairy Queen has just closed down. Wendy's and an oil place closed down. What is our political person doing about this? If this keeps going, maybe South County mall will be next, like Crestwood. Why don't you call your congressmen or senators for the state of Missouri and find out what is going on to the heart of South County?
And don't assume the Texans will be stingier defensively in their second year under Wade Phillips. In Phillips' last five stops as defensive coordinator, his first team made the playoffs after not making it the season before.

Social Security wasn't designed to offer such generous terms to those who wait. Amendments in 1956 and 1961 gave participants a choice to collect benefits as early as 62 rather than wait until full retirement age, then 65. The formula determining payment size made collecting early as good a deal as waiting, says Gary Burtless, an economist and Social Security specialist with the Brookings Institution, a think tank.
The board did pass resolutions honoring the two other Cuyahoga County commissioners, Tim Hagan and Peter Lawson Jones, for their work with the agency. They also had NOACA board seats because of their county positions, which are being eliminated because of the change in county government.

Last season: After spending first half of schedule doing little offensively, Seahawks found formula that works based on pounding running of Marshawn Lynch.

• An overhaul of the corporate tax code so companies headquartered in New Jersey pay income taxes based solely on sales made in-state (A1676).

It would be welcome to hear those fretting about the mostly elusive Islamophobia in America express outrage about the actual persecution - burning of houses of worship, killing of the faithful - against Christians in a number of Muslim nations.

&bull Requiring all current public employees to contribute at least 1.5 percent of their annual salaries toward their health benefits, and all future retirees to contribute at least 1.5 percent of their base pension to their health benefits.

In family immigration cases, such as where a U.S. citizen petitions for a brother or sister, the affidavit filed by the petitioner is a binding legal document. It commits the petitioner to reimburse government agencies for certain need-based benefits received by the beneficiary of the petition.

Though the law requiring the binding affidavit, USCIS form I-864, Affidavit of Support Under Section 213 of the Act, passed more than 20 years ago, few courts have enforced the requirement that the petitioner support the beneficiary. More commonly, some public entities seek reimbursement from a petitioner. That too is rare.

Would anyone be surprised if Williams was a factor by Labor Day? Would anyone be surprised if Venus was sitting in her kid sister’s box by Labor Day, relegated to fan status only? No, and no. Venus has a 59-10 record at the U.S. Open and reached the semifinals a year ago, but she hasn’t been the last player standing there in a decade.

"He's going to be a small forward in the NBA," Cronin said. "For them he's a hybrid big guy, he's really not a big guy. The advantage we have when we play a team with two bigs, I don't see that in this game, because he can move. I don't think we have an advantage in the aspect where he has to guard someone he can't. I think he can do it."

Her odds-on re-election is based on her effectiveness, attention to her district and sensible politics. She has worked to shore up the city's emergency services system by insisting on trained professionals, not political appointees, at the helm.

I call it "Thanksgiving by Fire," and not simply because it involves persuading 17 relatives to cram into a living room/dining room/foyer not suited to host more than 12.

From Little League to major league baseball, the importance of putting the ball in play can't be overlooked. You put the ball in play, and a bad hop or error can occur if you don't even get a clean hit. I look at this as a multi-step process. In the case of Dunn, at least he was working some deep counts and he has been prone to strike out more than some of his teammates. I was surprised by the the high strikeout rate of Morel and Beckham. There seems to be more deep counts, which is good if you can knock out the starter before the end of the sixth. But there are certain spots in the batting order where there is a premium on putting the ball in place. The No. 2, 8 and 9 spots fall under this category because the No. 2 spot should be a contact spot, and the No. 8-9 spots can only help roll the lineup over.

Why do these disturbing conditions exist? Because jobs, mostly in manufacturing, have gone and continue to go overseas. Our middle class is and always has been reliant on manufacturing jobs as the locomotive of a prosperous economy. Manufacturing jobs need to be recreated in America or else jobs sent overseas need to be returned. Our elected leaders in Washington need to stop the rhetoric, compromise, and work in concert with the private sector to create both temporary and long-term jobs. This should be the their number one priority.

Redistricting has not turned out to be the giant boon some Republicans thought it might be, and the party is playing to beat about 20 sitting Democrats and to win about a half-dozen open seats.

Not surprisingly, many of Bar Symon's tavern-style dishes are on trend. It's been a hallmark of chef-owner Michael Symon's menus at Lola, Lolita, Detroit's Roast and his defunct New York City spot, Parea, ever since his food first attracted attention at the Caxton Cafe almost 20 years ago. But not merely trendy: Symon's food is nearly always well-executed, too. Grilled trout, decorated with fresh oregano and minced onion, for instance, is coddled by just enough fruity olive oil to give the dish an added dimension ($17). The same can be said for a pile of smoky pork butt that shares the plate with briny cabbage slaw ($15). It's sweet, tart and salty all at once. (According to the restaurant, that pork butt is now presented as a taco filling, served daily.)

This has to be one, if not, the worst chamber match in history. I full expect Santino to not even make it to the chamber. As he is playing his air trombone (is that PG?) to the ring, someone needs to throw him into the ring steps, just like what Edge did Kofi Kingston a few years back.

The IRS prohibits political campaign activity on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office by houses of worship that are tax-exempt through their status as a 501(c)(3) organization.

Religious organizations can engage in "a limited amount" of lobbying, including ballot measures, and can advocate for (or against) political issues.

Their were so many accolades since Bill Drake's death that it is only proper to say he touched my life as well. When I opened my travel agency back in the '80's and Dan Erhler was manager of the Chamber of Commere they had what they called an "after-hours cocktail party" rotating each month at different businesses. Because I was a member of the chamber and paid the same dues, I wanted one, too, at my home. Dan brought the bar and charged 50 cents a drink. I remember promoting the Delta Queen as I had just come off a Fam trip (free familarization sponserd by the cruise industry) so I served Cajun food and mint juleps. The cruise rep showed film on the riverboats and my sorority sister from Mississippi dressed as a Southern belle. The hostess usually paid for the cocktails at the end of the evening, but Dan didn't charge me as he said I had one of the most successful after hours. At least 40 people attended, and guess who took the pictures for the Tribune? Bill Drake. Sad to say, I never placed an ad in the paper as I was as busy as I wanted to be, but I did write about my trips that I took when I came back. Reading last week's remembrance, I remembered all those columnists, especially Lotus Perez. And I believe Elaine is one of the last left from that group. Bill always wrote good articles, especially obituaries. I once said to him that I wanted him to do mine, but now it looks like I will have to write my own. Bill always thought about the little people, and he will surely be missed.

That would be welcome for Love, the 23-year-old who finished the season fourth in the league in scoring and second in rebounding. He signed a contract extension in January that allows him to opt out in three years, so the heat is on to surround him with talent that is capable of winning now.

On my last day in Iceland, I visited the Blue Lagoon. Riding past fields filled with nothing but moss-covered, holey black lava rocks, I saw the steam first, a long plume of white in the still-dark sky at 9 a.m. I'd booked a package that included a trip to the lagoon followed by drop-off at the airport. Entrance alone is about $22; I paid about $34 for the bus trip and entrance, plus $4 to rent a plush turquoise towel, which matched the plastic bracelet that gave me access to a locker in the spotless changing room.

RE: Vehicle stickers and water rates. Water rates, you know, (Water Commissioner) Tom Powers came in while we were going through the budget, laid out the history of what our problems are. It was in a meeting, here, with a map laid out in front of me what the problems are as it relates to the antiquated water system. There was just a report, either in your paper or no Bloomberg, about that this country is facing a $1.2 trillion deficit just two weeks ago. And Tom walked me through how bad our system is, both water, sewer pumping stations, etc., and he said how much we spend on just emergencies like wells yesterday or last week, over the weekend, which was a 99-year-old pipe. Again, I don't go chasing tough issues. Listen, you asked me. Tom presented here as every commissioner did when we were talking about this and I asked him questions: What are you doing? Are you set up to do what you're supposed to do? Is this the best way to do it? What do you got to do to change? Tom presented what was the basic problem currently of the water infrastructure and the sewer system. Then I went through a process of what would it take to fix it and I asked him to come back with a series of plans. He came back and there were like five or six options. Then, like always I narrowed it down, I'm doing this by memory, two to three. We massaged a couple of those both on what the work would be, how to get it, and then I basically made a decision that I was going to present to the public through the budget speech in an attempt to deal with what has been an underfinanced, and we're not me, this is true across the country. We are launching the largest water infrastructure investment of any city. This is a cloud, problem even your own paper has written about because we spend somewhere around, I'm doing this by memory so I could be off, $30 to $35 million dollars doing emergency work and I have been working on, you know, how I am going to do this and in Congress I did what the problem is and what we thought it would take to fix it. What was originally proposed is not what I then ultimately settled on, but it is something we agreed to do to get the job done.

Browns fans, every bit as sentimental as those of college teams, say Brian Sipe, the NFL's Most Valuable Player in the Kardiac Kids' season of 1980, was slight in stature and arm strength. That makes one small quarterback without a great arm who became an NFL star. Another is Drew Brees in New Orleans, who has a better arm than McCoy and Sipe and has won a Super Bowl. Brees also plays every home game in a dome. And then there's . . . little Eddie LeBaron?

Either way, it appears that Oregonians soon may see a vigorous debate on casino gaming.
It was also a relief to have the sugar level lowered in the often syrupy chicken teriyaki glaze ($15 dinner, $7.50 lunch). This treatment gave the classic dish a complex but cleaner taste, letting even mere sesame seeds register on the tongue. The meat itself was cut thinly on the diagonal, letting us know, once again, of the exactness and grace of the kitchen. The only disappointment was the strength of the broth in the Beef Udon ($9.95 dinner, $8.95 lunch). Everything was there: thick noodles, shiitake mushroom slices, cabbage and tissues of cooked beef. But the broth seemed more chicken-y than beef-y -- honest, but not as rich as expected.
"These were people just like us. There's a lot of soul searching and agonizing going on. ... Where do we go from here? I don't know."
All the advance hype surrounding “Ghost Brothers” has been somewhat scary, too. How could it not be, as a world-premiere (no doubt Broadway-bound) collaboration between none other than Stephen King, John Mellencamp and T Bone Burnett? But never fear: Under the mesmerizing direction of our very own Susan V. Booth, the Alliance production lives up to it with an almost supernatural ease.
But even if the Barner-Carson-Thomas trio provides close to the production James did, he won't easily be replaced. James, in many ways, is the heart and soul of this team.

Here's another reason not to raise taxes. Gov. Jerry Brown insists taxes must be raised to maintain the level of California government, so he's proposing income and sales tax increases on the ballot in the fall. But this money wouldn't maintain current spending levels. It would increase spending by 7 percent.
“You make 48 saves, that’s a big night for any goaltender,” Johnston said. “And some of them were pretty tough saves. There were scrambles around the net and I thought he hung onto the puck and found the puck. That was the difference.
What really happened is that greedy, incompetent and corrupt Democrats sued the state controller and, predictably, found some sympathetic judge to rule in their favor. Now, the Democrats in the Legislature determine whether their fake budgets are balanced so they can get paid.
Second, the challenges ahead are technically difficult. There's a reason that no president since Reagan has been able to reform the tax code. There's a reason no president save Obama has been able to pass health care reform. These are complicated issues that require a sophisticated inside game - navigating through the special interests, building complex coalitions. They are issues that require executive expertise.
"I really focused on fighting back, and I told myself I wasn't going to lose that game," Lawson said. "I just had to stay mentally tough."

A: First, if they don't win it all, or perhaps even if they do, I think the new luxury tax will force the Heat to eventually break up the Big Three. I also think that if they don't win it all, the odds would be very long for Spoelstra to return.
WASHINGTON and LOS ANGELES — It's not a TV political drama but it could be. Call it "The McKeons."

Strike Force officers were at the impound lot as part of a drug investigation, Omodt said. Ochoa said she had lent her car to a friend a few days before the incident. A Minneapolis police report shows the friend was arrested and the car impounded because he did not have a valid driver's license, but officers later found .2 grams of suspected cocaine on him. The Hennepin County attorney's office declined to charge the friend.

White Nelson Diehl Evans, which has an office in Irvine, hired of Heather Ostrowski of Newport Beach as an audit junior.
Johnson: "No, not at all. To me, it was like wherever I go, I am going to make it to the NFL. That's my goal. I didn't care if I went to Solano Community College, which is where I started at. I was going to make it, I didn't care. If I went D-2 (Division II), D-3 (Division III) or NAIA, I was going to make it to the NFL. That was my goal the first time I stepped on campus."
After the squatters that moved in after the tenants left were evicted, the house was finally Skomsvold and Scott's. With a shoestring budget, they did as much work as they could themselves: The roof had to be fixed, new flooring put in, the walls repainted, and a new kitchen put in.
An outspoken advocate of science-based nutrition, Jacobson won the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's CDC Foundation Hero Award in 2010. But on the holiday he refers to as "Junk Food Day," he knows he's not considered a hero by neighborhood kids. After all, when they're out collecting "garbage," as he puts it, he tries to up the healthfulness of their haul by handing out raisins. "I suspect they eat their candy bars before they eat their raisins, but they don't throw them back," he says.

“It doesn’t seem right. We wrestle with that, and I can’t explain it and never will,” Smith said, “but God’s word is done and everlasting, and the more and longer you know Him...the truth becomes more real — this world is not my home; I’m just passing through.”

Employees are not guaranteed positions with the new owners. Rowan said it is up to BSD Entities if they want to keep all the employees or none of them.
The authors do not suggest McVeigh and Nichols are innocent. Actually, anybody (like myself) who has researched and written about law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the United States will find much of the book sadly familiar. Yes, such agencies regularly handle routine cases well. But on too many high-profile cases, those with authority suffer from two recurring problems: tunnel vision after identifying suspects and failure to share vital information.
Two of the four - J. Russell Coffey and Harry Landis - had served stateside in the U.S. Army. Coffey died in December 2007 at 109; Landis, in February 2008 at 108.

Johnny Ludden, Yahoo! Sports: "Bryant remains a transcendent talent, the game's greatest competitor, and he can still carry these Lakers through games, even weeks. But he can't lift them to a championship alone, and the most satisfying night of his career should have taught him that. In Game 7 of last season's NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics, he nearly shot the Lakers out of a 16th title. So determined to win the game on his own, he nearly lost it. Not until Derek Fisher barked at him, did he finally take his finger off the trigger. In the rush to push Bryant onto Michael Jordan's pedestal, it was overlooked how close Bryant had come to staining his legacy with the selfish superstar stigma he's worked so hard to erase. In truth, Kobe is more stubborn than selfish. It's served him well for much of his career, but it will also work against him as he gets older."
"Just like a power line coming down in the neighborhood, you lose power," NJ Transit spokesman Dan Stessel said.

Gingrich was the first to criticize the president. Never mind that thousands have taken to the streets to protest news of the desecrations, that two U.S. troops have been killed in retaliation and that mullahs are using the incident to drum up more calls against U.S. “infidels.”
Johnson said he was sitting by McCourt at the season opener only to pick his brain, because that’s simply smart business. Believe that if you’d like – he couldn’t do that in private some other time? – but he clearly seems to understand the public outrage over McCourt’s ownership.
The ruling upheld a juvenile court judge who applied a U.S. Supreme Court standard on school searches because there were no previous Oregon cases that applied.
Specifically, the board found that he inserted cardiac stents into arteries that weren't clogged enough to need them — likely because of "pressure to produce."
"Tarnished Angel" moves systematically from desire to degeneracy, from degeneracy to clarity. In its trajectory and its insight, the poem recalls the best work of Horace, the Roman poet of the Augustan Age, who wrote "if you wish to weep, you must first mourn yourself." That's the kind of logical notion that epitomizes a sensibility of the poised and even-keeled, the very sort of mind and art Powell has mastered.
If Rutgers (5-3, 2-2 in Big East) defeat South Florida (4-3, 0-3), it may be able to salvage a season that is fast slipping away after two straight losses. If the Scarlet Knights lose, it's another disappointing season for coach Greg Schiano and a third-tier bowl game.

It's not that his grandfather was particularly happy; some of the most moving passages in the book deal with the author's ambivalence, or outright discomfort, toward him, a distance less generational than constitutional. "My grandfather was not an easy man," Treuer writes. "He was not … the kind of traditional elder that a lot of younger people seek out for approval and advice.… When we were kids and my cousins and I came into the house from playing, more often than not he would say, 'Get the hell out.'"
Mull and Antuane Rogers as Templeton have to unpack a lot of exposition, and their initial interchanges often feel brittle, like well-rehearsed recitations. But they soon begin sculpting the beats and inhabiting flesh-and-blood characters.

This demure dressing-up is a far cry from the dressed-down black-leather leggings, biker jackets and slouchy tees that had previously dominated so many runways. And it doesn't stop at the catwalk.

"I've heard people say that they're afraid to get involved and to come into this, and you know, it makes me really emotional," Horman said, his voice steely. "He's afraid, OK?

On a miserable day at the Masters where they had to laugh to keep from crying, two of the best golfers in the world each turned a shot at the green jacket into a comedy of errors.
The Pasadena Symphony’s Saturday afternoon concert at the Ambassador Auditorium afforded many pleasures: soulful playing by the orchestra itself; the skilled, sustained and often inspired conducting of Michael Stern (a late substitute for the symphony’s music director, James DePreist, who is recovering from heart surgery), and the enveloping acoustics of a fine, mid-sized concert hall.

Instead, Moore has frustrated the entire team with inconsistent play and has been on the ice for two of the Blues' five power play goals in this series, as well as one of their even-strength goals. Moore hasn't been impressive in other areas, either, including faceoffs. He's a good candidate to not even dress Thursday night and be a healthy scratch, at least from the looks of things at Wednesday's practice. Moore's penalty-kill partner usually has been Daniel Winnik. But over the years, Thornton has paired with just about everyone on the roster.

Cars stop. Men get out and look around. They find nothing. They get back into the cars. They drive to the next location. Cars stop. Men get out and look around. This goes on for quite some time. Initially, Ceylan ("Three Monkeys") chooses to tell this tale from a great distance, wide shots far removed from the humans but drinking in the panoramic vastness of the Anatolian night. There is not much light or life in these shots. Eventually he zooms in, taking us tight inside the cars.
What the fallout will be in the long term is still to be determined, said one official with a charity watchdog organization.
