Davis sat on Friday night when Colorado started a hard-throwing left-handed pitcher. Davis is a left-handed hitter. From a strategic standpoint, the move made sense.
And for anybody who thought he’d charge into the big market and seize the opportunity to trumpet his faith or his faith-based causes, Tebow wasn’t about to cause a controversy with that, either. It was a full 20 minutes before religion came up, and he didn’t kneel behind the podium when it did.
He concluded the catch and sprint by showing off his 4.38-second 40-yard dash speed and freakish athleticism, leaping over safety Kenny Phillips into the end zone to give the 49ers a 20-13 lead they would not relinquish when the teams met the first time.
In the '80s it seemed the One Thing was metal vs. pop, Ramona Falls singer and songwriter Brent Knopf said Saturday afternoon, before that band's fourth and final set of the festival. That's no longer true: "There's so much more to choose from and it makes the experience so much better. It also makes the choices so much tougher."
Vinnie Iyer, Sporting News: A-minus. “Upshaw has a chance to fill the big void of fellow former Alabama star Jarret Johnson, while Osemele was the powerful guard they needed.”

Warren County Coroner Roger Mauzy, who has tried to intercede with commissioners on behalf of the Neier family, said repairs to guardrails because of crashes likely would be covered by a motorist's insurance so maintenance costs should be minimal.
The selection of Ewing could mean the end of fullback Ovie Mughelli’s career in Atlanta. Mughelli, who went to the Pro Bowl after the 2010 season, is battling back from a knee injury. He’s in the last year of a contract with a $3.7 million cap number for 2012. NFL teams seldom carry two traditional fullbacks.
The insurance company looked at the driving record for each member in the study for the six months prior to deployment and then at their experience after returning to the U.S. The three-year study started in January 2007 and included 158,000 troops who had 171,000 deployments to various overseas locations.
In only two years, this unlikely Mission restaurant has gone from pop-up to permanent wow. Chef Joshua Skenes and wine czar Mark Bright took over a barn with concrete floors that included an outdoor fireplace that became the inspiration for much of the cooking. The pair continues to upgrade the experience, polishing the rough edges and removing seats. Skenes' food is more exciting than ever, with the juxtaposition of rustic elements (fire cooking/foraged ingredients) and refined techniques. His multicourse feast dazzles. Like a theater performance, you'll have to buy non-refundable tickets in advance, starting later this month. Currently, the 10-course menu, with a few add-ons, is $198; wine pairings add $118. Eat at the chef's kitchen counter and you pay $498, including wine.

If there's one clear lesson in the debacle that is the state's recruitment of Mamtek, a Chinese-American company that aimed to make a high-tech sweetener but instead left the city of Moberly on the hook for $28 million in bonds, it's that dissent wasn't a value held in high regard during the process, which resulted in debt, not job production.
Usually, the sharing tree provides gifts to about 130 children, said Kling, but this year it is up to 287. The food bank is also collecting hats, mittens, and candy canes for the children’s Christmas stocking items.

After casually blazing through the bullet-train finale to Camille Saint-Saëns' Piano Concerto No. 5 in F major, Jean-Yves Thibaudet, soloist with the San Francisco Symphony, looked tickled. The pianist bowed toward his cheering fans at Davies Symphony Hall, revealing a gleaming pendant, which peeked out from behind his open-necked collar -- a neat symbol for the dazzle and opulence of the performance, the piece and this entire program of French and French-driven works.
--Up your good-news foods. Make sure you get omega-3 -- particularly DHA-found in salmon, walnuts and supplements (900 mg a day; take an algae-based supplement); nutrients called carotenoids -- beta carotene, lutein (10 mg a day), and zeaxanthin; and vitamin C, E and zinc. They're in fresh produce, nuts, fortified cereals, papaya, pumpkin, eggs, sweet potatoes and supplements. A vitamin B pill with 100 percent of the daily value of folic acid, B-6 and B-12 can cut AMD by up to 40 percent. Don't take more than that -- it ups the risk for other diseases.

Once inside, the first thing I saw was Mayor Gavin Newsom's handsome face on 42-inch plasma TVs perched high over the scrambled eggs and bagels. The sound was off, but whatever San Francisco's mayor, the gay community's favorite politician, was saying, he looked emphatic about it.
But some economists seem to find manufacturing almost demeaning -- high-rent, low-wage scut work best left to the developing world. Losing those jobs, they say, is really proof of America's greatness, its very essence.
"It was so much fun watching her figure out what toys were, and how to play," said Janel.
If it's good enough for God, it ought to be good enough for Caesar.
Once again, the No. 1s made it through their opening rounds unscathed, although one could reasonably argue that a blown officials call in the closing moments of Syracuses scare against North Carolina-Ashville denied the biggest tournament underdogs of all its best chance of finally cracking through that glass ceiling.
Matt Carroll, Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald's chief of staff, who is on the search committee, said that county leadership would prefer to move as quickly as possible in finding a new leader.

For all the successes, quibbles are minor. The Goomba meatballs were less interesting on their own, as an antipasti ($9). This time, the blend of house-ground Pozzi Ranch veal and Bailey & Long pork was flabby and chalky under a flurry of grated Parmesan. A special of seafood gumbo ($6.25) was oddly chalky, too, tasting mostly of pepper in an oily tomato broth very lightly stocked with chopped prawns, mussels and barley.
The general fund budget was at $99,758,190 for 2011-12, while the 2012-13 proposed budget is $96,363,643. The operating funds are projected to be cut by about $3.4 million, which
"Those meetings included both non-political and political discussions completely unrelated to the Senate, so we always err on the side of caution and never include on any state government materials any meetings that included political discussions," Aquilino said.

Not at all. Herbal medicine uses extracts of botanical substances, whereas homeopaths use ultra-diluted "micro" doses made from not only plants but also minerals or any other substance found in nature. Homeopathy is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration like an over-the-counter drug. But because homeopathic remedies contain little or no active ingredients, they don't have to go through the safety and efficacy testing required of new OTC drugs. Herbs are considered dietary supplements.

"Residence halls, with a mix of ages, represents a unique circumstance that you have to look at carefully," she said. "The carry permit isn't the concern, it's what happens after the gun is in the apartment, or in the dorm.

But potential solutions to re-raise levels in the Michigan-Huron basin mostly fail for several reasons, and not just cost. The most hopeful possibility was the opportunity to place subsurface turbines in the St. Clair River, slowing down the river flow with the plus of a new electricity source. But it turns out that the best place for generating electricity is also prime sturgeon spawning habitat. Virtually every other means for slowing the river results in a similarly unappetizing conflict with boat traffic or wildlife. Even the temporary effects of any such effort could do harm for years on downriver fisheries, particularly in Lake St. Clair.
At the end, my quadriceps were literally trembling beyond my control. And to think I'd actually contemplated running back and forth to this assignment.
"The Irish impairments, payment protection insurance mess and higher costs all spell trouble for the bank," said Christopher Purdy, a sales trader at Spreadex. He said the drop in shares was "magnified" as investors digested the implications of the higher-than-expected impairments.

His friends call him "Shaq Attack," because no matter whether he is playing wide receiver, defensive back, tailback, quarterback or punter, the one thing an opponent can be sure of is that he is going to unleash speed and power.
It's hard to argue with him on that. Minneapolis has invested more than $100 million in Target Center. The building will gobble up an additional $75 million or so in tax increment financing subsidies between now and 2025, but that will still leave the city on the hook for a projected $69 million in operating losses and capital improvements between now and then.
For several years, conservative money managers have said dividends would increasingly make up a greater slice of a stock investor's total return.

Why were his or her friends so influential? The authors surmised that a girl or boy looking to cement a romantic relationship will naturally adjust his or her risky behavior to match that of her or his potential mate's buddies. Your child likely calculates that befriending those important people will make him or her more appealing to the person he or she has a crush on. And, in fact, in cases in which the crush was one-sided, the influence of a potential mate's friends was even more powerful.
Taylor, who is now 20, testified on Friday she restrained the older woman as the two men fought, but that when she let Kathleen Maltese go, the woman attacked her son, who then strangled her.

Case: On March 23, 2009, Gilbert Leon, 54, was driving on 16th Street near Elwood Street when he was struck by a bullet fired from a blue 1996 Chevrolet Caprice. Four people were inside the Caprice when the suspect opened fire on the vehicle, striking it several times. Police believe the suspect was targeting a rival gang and that Leon was struck by a stray bullet. Phoenix police issued a warrant for Taylor's arrest in September. The documented gang member is also known as Maurice Taylor and "Woo." He should be considered armed and dangerous.

Yes, it definitely feels like yesterday when I was taking classes at OSU and playing ball. I definitely miss the environment of OSU and the coaches and players as well. It was a time I will never forget. I still try to keep up with old friends and teammates from OSU. As for the memories of playing in Reser Stadium in front of all of Beaver Nation, that’s one thing I will never forget and will always miss. Its okay though, I look forward to playing in front of Beaver Nation again, just on a bigger scale. The NFL. Until then, I’m just working my way back to the top.

Today it is easy to manage our savings for less than 0.20 percent a year. We don't need to do market timing; we don't need to have the vaguest idea of what we are doing. We only need some degree of diversification. Going from an expensive investment plan to an inexpensive one can increase our lifetime nest egg by about 40 percent - an amount equal to about 15 years of accumulated contributions.

Unfortunately, Memphis Avenue drivers travel in the dark as they pass under railroad tracks on the edge of Linndale. Lights under the overpass serve as little more than decoration right now, making it a tad tough to spot the rim-wrecking depression in the left eastbound lane. The hole's there, though, as too many motorists find out too late.
The dance band will perform six numbers under the direction of saxophonist Scott Johnson, a member of the Blues since 1975 and winner of the coveted Sousa award in 1978.

While other kids knew him as an actor, Davis thought of him "as a fat guy with a squeaky voice."

2. Kansas City (1) - You're probably wondering how can an undefeated team not be ranked No. 1? Strength of schedule. Let's look at Kansas City's opponents during their unbeaten run to start the season: D.C. United, New England, Dallas, Chivas and Los Angeles. A combined record of 8-13-3. Yes, they defeated the defending champs 1-0, but right now, that's not saying a whole lot. A major test looms when Real Salt Lake comes to town Saturday in a potential MLS Cup preview.
"He's had that from getting to know him through spring training,'' manager Robin Ventura said before the game. "He's a humble kid. A hard worker and all those things.

However, that's just Brown's proposal, and no one knows whether legislators will write a contingency plan for rejection of taxes. Nor does anyone know whether they'll enact another Brown proposal to give more money to low-performing districts and, therefore, less to everyone else.
The bank did not provide specific details about what caused the losses; however, they appeared to stem from derivatives tied to usually stable corporate bonds. JPMorgan bet that prices would move in one direction, and it lost when they moved the other way.

A juicer squeezes fresh mango or orange juice and the Venezuelan favorite called "tres en uno" — beet, orange and carrot juices deliciously mixed. Should you want a light meal before diving into the churros, the soups and salads are just satisfying enough to leave you still hungering for an order of dessert. A rustic purée of butternut squash holds squash chunks, potato and tiny bits of Swiss chard set off with hot red pepper. A bocadillo of tortilla Española, crispy, eggy with a touch of onion, replicates the Spanish classic. And mushrooms in a port wine reduction over a good piece of filet mignon fill a panino or come plated with salad.

The governor seems to pluck numbers out of the air. One week he claims that the fraud rate is 25%; the next week it’s 10%. In fact, quality-assurance reviews for the In-Home Support Services program at the state and county levels consistently suggest a far lower rate. And one thing the governor won't mention: He's cut funding for case management, dependent-adult abuse prevention and background checks, and has vetoed legislation to improve home-care worker training and set training standards -- all of which would reduce fraud and protect and better serve consumers.

In the Embarcadero Station in San Francisco, a shouting crowd flees in panic from a sudden rush of water coming from the Transbay Tube. The aftershock has caused the steel seismic joint anchoring the tube in San Francisco, already under enormous strain, finally to fail. The tube quickly floods. So do the San Francisco stations built below sea level. So do the two trains still in the tube. The remaining passengers do not emerge. Neither do the rescue teams sent to find them.

Not that long ago, I was told by someone who has great insight into this negotiation that unlike the first talks that created this original lease agreement, this go-round has some good, honest creative tension in the room.

At the intersection of Paseo del Norte and Cannon, across from the entry to the auto mall, I pulled off into the U-pick-em strawberry field. This is not the tiny little patch you find throughout Southern California, but a huge operation on the side of a sloping hill. Parking in a dirty and gravel lot, I lined up behind the school groups getting their baskets to head out into the field. The morning fog had burned off and the sun glinted through the corners of my polarized Ray-Bans. I looked at the bucket, then the people playing farmworker in the field, then the three-pack of strawberries for sale.

Romney focused much of his speech on a standard Republican refrain, arguing that Obama has enacted job-killing regulations that stymie innovation. “Government does not create prosperity; free markets and free people create prosperity,” he said. “The president has expanded government instead of empowering the American people.

Offensive line isn’t a huge immediate need for the Giants, as they have a group of versatile veterans that will give them plenty of possible alignments. Still, the team is checking out options at guard (Amini Silatolu, Midwestern State, second-round projection) and tackle (Donald Stephenson, Oklahoma, third round) in the first few rounds. Stephenson has very good footwork, which is something Jerry Reese loves to see in tackles. Mississippi State tackle James Carmon isn’t as gifted in that department, so he’s a late-round option. But he visited the team and could be an option on Day 3.

This is not a prescription for savaging the U.S. Army and Marine Corps or eliminating the nation's capacity to carry out counterinsurgency operations altogether. No such decisions would be prudent given a now nuclear-armed North Korea, a Middle East in tumult, a Kashmir capable of igniting all-out India-Pakistan war, or an American military still focused on the important and ongoing Afghanistan mission. But it is an appropriate change in light of budgetary and economic challenges, together with happier developments: the demise of Saddam Hussein, the growing strength of the South Korean military and the ongoing conventional military weakness of Iran for classic ground operations. It might lead to savings of up to $150 billion over a decade, making major headway toward the $400 billion goal (but hardly toward the nearly trillion-dollar figure that some in Congress are considering).

It's a double whammy, because many schools report they are already being hurt by falling property values, foreclosures, business closures and the gradual phase-out of the tangible personal property tax, which was based on inventory, equipment and furniture owned by businesses. The state has been making districts whole on that phase-out, but those subsidies eventually will end.

From Summerwood it's a straight shot over the 101 to Templeton for a quick taste of the area's other bright star, artisanal agriculture. Every Saturday morning from 9 to 12 Templeton holds a farmers market that I am told trumps the one in Paso Robles. I have been to farmers markets all over the state but never one where you could shop for sustainable meats, from beef to lamb to pork, from animals that did their grazing a few miles away. Looking at the gorgeous lettuces and tomatoes, I remember that kitchenette at Villa Toscana.

I don't want to oversell "Another Earth." A few passages, like one involving a venerable janitor, feel downright pretentious, while the mysterious apparition of Earth 2 promises a profundity that doesn't pay off. (And when Rhoda and John peer at the nearby planet through an amateur telescope, why in this world don't they open the window to see it more clearly?) All the same, a small, smart movie that keeps you watching intently is a big deal.

"The way it seems to work for the average voter is that the better the economy looks, the more favorably they look on the incumbent, particularly an executive," said John Green, director of the Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron. "Gov. Kasich and President Obama would make very different arguments about why the economy is improving. But if you just look at the level of economic performance ... then it is really a blessing that can go either way. It can help the Republican governor as well as the Democratic president."

It's difficult to muster a lot of enthusiasm for the 12-member congressional deficit reduction committee that would be charged as part of this deal with coming up with the remaining $1.6 trillion in deficit reductions. The idea is more or less modeled on the base realignment and closure process, or BRAC, which amounts to a congressional recognition that it is too self-interested and petty to make difficult decisions. The committee's job would be to develop a deficit reduction package by Thanksgiving that would be subject to an up-or-down vote by the end of the year. If it doesn't, or if the package is rejected by Congress, the alternative would be steep spending cuts, half in domestic programs and half to the defense department.
During a set visit to Rhimes "Private Practice," TV critics couldn't goad her into bashing Heigl, whom she saved last season despite Izzy's bout with near-fatal brain cancer.

For the remainder of the picks the time is torture. Draft time is not real time, it is Chinese torture time. Each second feels like a minute, each minute like an hour, the wait is agonizing.

It's hard to imagine that even a guy so enthralled with himself would spend part of his last night of freedom making what sounded like some bizarre campaign concession speech in live TV time.

After displaying extreme competence in place of Caleb Hanie last week against the Packers, McCown has a chance to solidify a shot at the Bears' backup job for 2012 with a strong finish agianst the Vikings. Had Earl Bennett gotten into the end zone instead of getting tackled at the 1 on a 49-yard play, McCown's passer rating would have been 88.8 - better than Cutler's season average of 85.7. McCown historically throws to the most talented receivers on the field, so it's worth noting Roy Williams (6-81) and Dane Sanzenbacher (4-51) were his favorite targets last week. The Vikings are thin in the secondary and ranked 29th against the pass.
Mirakutei was marketed as part noodle house, and Japanese noodle buffs hoped it would fan the flames of the city's ramen romance. At first, the "ramen-ya" designation seemed odd. The space felt too new, too formal. Big windows put diners on display; slurping felt taboo. Minimalist decorations are limited to a lone white orchid behind the sushi bar and a large framed image of a Tokyo intersection. Worse, the ramen itself underwhelmed, with adequately cooked noodles, limp bean sprouts and small dimes of char siu pork.

Still, she called the method The Times was using "primitive" and "rudimentary," and said that publishing the test-score data was comparable to the recent broadcast of a misleading excerpt from a videotape of a speech by Shirley Sherrod, a U.S. Department of Agriculture official.

Meanwhile, SEC chairman Mary Schapiro and enforcement chief Robert Khuzami bristle at the suggestion that they're pushovers.

The SEC now compels anyone guilty in a criminal context to admit to as much in an SEC settlement. "If we can get in a settlement about what we'd win in litigation, get that money back to investors sooner, then turn our resources to the next case, that's a deal I'll take," Schapiro says.
