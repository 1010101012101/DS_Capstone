"We largely see what we expect to see," says Daniel Simons, one of the study's creators and now a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois. As he notes in his subsequent book, "The Invisible Gorilla" (co-authored with Christopher Chabris), the more attention a task demands, the less attention we can pay to other things in our field of vision.

The house, of course, is where all the characters converge.
The highly charged and hard-fought contests overshadowed Romney's continued progress toward the GOP presidential nomination.

The verdict: Allen’s less interested in Gil’s romance (or lack thereof) with Inez than his love affair with the city, which is a pure delight even as “Midnight in Paris” threatens to become a series of cultural name-checking (here’s Matisse, there’s Bunuel, etc.). Very funny and deeply charming, “Midnight in Paris” is a living dream about feeling at home somewhere else, with someone else. The movie salutes that sense of escape while recognizing that nostalgia comes with a certain amount of denial about the present, though Allen’s too emotionally insulated to let his characters truly suffer for their loneliness. Wilson’s excellent as a guy with diverging impulses as both a writer (Hollywood schlock vs. artistic novel) and a man (unpleasant fiancé vs. new fantasy woman). He’s supported by similarly lively work by Cotillard, Michael Sheen (as smugness personified) and Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali. The way he pronounces “rhinoceros” is a thing of beauty.

The afternoon meeting on the second floor of the State House was part of O'Malley's broader effort to bring the Senate and House together in a special session to pass a tax increase and take other steps that would avert more than $500 million in cuts to his budget that Democratic lawmakers never intended to take effect. But because two budget companion bills failed after the budget passed on the last night of the regular session April 9, the so-called Doomsday Budget cuts will automatically take effect July 1 unless lawmakers act to stop them. Since the cuts falls heavily on the core Democratic jurisdictions and priorities, members of the majority party are under significant pressure to act -- even as Republicans and some conservative Democrats insist the state should live with the budget that was approved.

Social change rarely comes easily, but make no mistake, the legalization of same-sex marriage is inevitable. It is the direction in which this country is moving and the pace of that change is accelerating. Recently, Washington state approved it, joining the handful of states where same-sex marriage is permitted. The legislature in New Jersey will likely do the same. Voting the bill down this year does not mean the matter will go away. Lawmakers will confront the issue year after year until it is passed — and, ultimately, decided by the voters in a referendum.

He is best known for his paintings of serene, domestic interior scenes rendered with exquisite compositional form, brilliant draftsmanship and a miraculous use of atmospheric light.

There is something otherworldly and magical about the pictures, a psychological and emotional charge that speaks across the centuries with the immediacy of contemporary life.

When he succeeded, taking UMass and later Memphis to the Final Four, his successes were negated by NCAA scandal, earning him a reputation as a renegade instead of a winner.

And those who know him well know he is, at his heart like any other coach, like any professional. No one wants to fail. Everyone wants to be viewed as a success."

What's not: If GiddyUp and Yelp had an app baby, I'd be really happy. I tested this app while on a road trip and didn't like having to use Yelp to search for a good restaurant before I could fill out the event location info on GiddyUp. And because I'm more likely to use it for inviting someone to lunch or a meeting than a big party, it would've been easier to type in a city and toggle among coffee shops, bars and restaurants to pick a meeting place rather than having to know a name or address ahead of time.

Witness the priceless exchange backstage at a television studio, when El Comandante smilingly refuses, and then reconsiders, a staffer's offer of makeup.
As I have written, I don't think there is any question the Bears would have been a better team with Olsen on it. But Olsen is not the type of tight end Martz prefers. Instead of dictating how Martz should play offense, general manager Jerry Angelo chose to give Martz the type of tools Martz felt he could best win with. The move also was made in what was thought to be the best long term interests of the organization. Olsen was entering the last year of his deal. The Bears were not going to resign him as long as Martz was the coordinator. So they traded him when they still could get value for him, rather than letting him walk away as a free agent. At least the team has a third-round pick to show for Olsen.

The lacrosse sticks collectively fly high in the air and then the Hereford boys lacrosse players all merge into one large mass of celebration. It's May at UMBC Stadium, and that means the Bulls have won yet another state championship. The program has won seven all time, and the last three have come under the watchful eye of coach Brian King. Talk about getting it done -- King has gone 57-3 in his three years as coach. After spending four years as an assistant coach working with the junior varsity, King took over a defending state championship team and tacked on three more crowns. He's never seen a season end on a low note and he does all he can to avoid it from happening. King and his wife, Stephanie, have two boys -- Brycen, 4, and Jameson, 2 -- and they are expecting a baby girl in two weeks. For King, a Washington College grad who teaches communication at Hereford, there's nothing better than coming home to his young boys and having them ask: 'Daddy, did the good guys win?' As this week's Coachspeak guest, we asked King about the early-season tests the Bulls have this season and some of the keys to maintaining the program's success.

For long stretches this year, the Bulls lineup has featured only one starter, Luol Deng, along with Lucas, Korver and defensive stalwarts Taj Gibson and center Omer Asik.

In France and Italy, the aperitif precedes a meal, so accompaniments are typically light: pistachios or salted peanuts, olives, potato chips, a sliver of onion tart, chicken liver crostini or a bit of tapenade or brandade on toast. At home, you can expand the concept to include dishes borrowed from Spain's tapas tradition, like toasted almonds, sliced Serrano ham, a potato and egg tortilla (omelet), or marinated Manchego cheese.

San Francisco park tidied up: Parents at Precita Park Playground can relax now that several safety concerns at the park have been addressed. ChronicleWatch reported on the park at Precita Avenue and Alabama Street in December, after a tipster told us she worried that broken latches on the park's gates allowed tots to wander onto the street. Several benches and picnic tables in the park were also damaged. Tipster Alex Gomez said he was more concerned about the sand buildup on the concrete walkway around the play structure, which caused children to slip and fall. "If someone sweeps it, I can't tell," said the local resident. The park, which was established in 1894, is flanked by Leonard Flynn Elementary School and the Precita Valley Community Center. After our calls, crews fixed the latches and repaired the benches and tables. Parks spokeswoman Rose Marie Dennis talked to a park supervisor and assured us that the sand will be swept regularly. "It's much better now, since you wrote about it," said Beth Mitchell, who lives nearby. "It's a slippery slope when things start to break down, but when it's kept up, it stays this way longer."

This cake goes quickly, so I'll often double it to make two. In that case, you'll either need two pots for the pears, or you can poach them in stages. I like to serve this with a mixture of half creme fraiche, half whipped cream sweetened with a bit of the leftover poaching liquid. You can make the brown butter for the base several days ahead, and finish the base and poach the pears a day before baking.

He also has his rivals, chief among them Huntsman, who has made an all-or-nothing bet on New Hampshire, to thank for making the primary seem consequential.
