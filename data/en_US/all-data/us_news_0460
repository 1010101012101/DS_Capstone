Because in the days since Messrs. Obama and Biden took turns praising Mr. Corzine, it's been revealed that the company Mr. Corzine led was ripping off investors left and right. Oh, and he seems to have lost $1.2 billion. If Mr. Corzine ever goes to trial, the judge should take into account the millions of Americans who have lost all or part of their pensions because of the negligence and/or corruption of people like him. Many Americans will be forced to work long after their intended retirement date due to the type of corporate greed and negligence Jon Corzine represents. Hence, 90 days as a Wal-Mart greeter or cashier might be the appropriate punishment for Mr. Corzine, and for all those fat-cat CEOs who pay such little mind to the financial well-being of their middle-class and pension fund investors.

When immigration policies eased up in the 1950s, their home became a mecca for people from her village. Bergad said that anyone who needed a room or a bed got one for as long as needed, sometimes for years. Three generations of Fong children and many extended families from her village came to love her Chinese sausage and egg-fried rice, deep-fried peanut puffs, steamed rice cakes, shrimp dumplings and other Cantonese specialties. She developed friendships and bonds that continued until her death.

A trade complaint filed last month by SolarWorld Industries Americas claims the Chinese cheat: They're liquidating heavily subsidized inventories of solar panels and cells and flooding the U.S. market. They're selling below cost, undermining U.S. solar producers. For that, Chinese solar products could face tariffs of more than 100 percent. Now reports Wednesday from China say a solar trade group is preparing to ask the government there to undertake its own investigation of U.S. companies that export polysilicon, the raw material for solar cells, to China. They're accusing U.S. companies of essentially the same thing -- dumping product below cost and putting Chinese companies out of business.

Even so, taken as a whole, Stevenson's "Cinderella" just doesn't feel like a classic in the grand tradition of story ballets. The real problem lies in the choreographic structure, which can seem noticeably thin in the places where Sergei Prokofiev's sumptuous score - danced here to a recording - is rich with possibilities, but later feels busy with steps when the music seems to call for simplicity. The first act has an overabundance of telegraphing plot details and less of the expressive dancing, of which Stevenson is highly capable.

Physicians and researchers are also now realizing that back pain can stem from minute tears at the cellular level. As in other parts of the body, the spine experiences a normal process of degeneration as we grow older.

These combined changes make the spine more susceptible to generating pain even with routine activity.

Such time machines don't have to be applied only to people. David Blei, a computer scientist at Princeton University, has been studying a vast trove of scientific journal articles.

Any papers that have the same topic scores could then be grouped together, even if they are decades apart and keywords or concepts didn't yet exist. (Think of quarks or H1N1.)

The White House and economists say exports by small businesses are helpful in that they also open markets for larger sales of goods and services from bigger companies.
“Spending is out of control. Our ballooning debt just isn’t some giant number on a spreadsheet. It’s a crisis, a crisis that today undermines the strength of our country and tomorrow will bankrupt our children,” Kyrillos, a Middletown resident, said to a crowd of over 100 supporters. “Yet the guys who got us into this mess, our president and Bob Menendez, are running for reelection. They made things worse, and they’re promising us more of the same.”
It was February 1972, and I was a guest at the wedding of Prince Rainier's niece, Christine-Alix de Massy, and my boyfriend's roommate, Wayne Knecht. My boyfriend, Joseph Evancich, was the best man at this wedding in Monaco's Royal Palace.
2. Help, they need somebody: In order for the Browns to suddenly put some points on the board, the offense will need extreme help from the special teams and defense. The only times the offense has done anything is when it received a boost from Josh Cribbs with good returns. Defensively, the Browns have to produce some turnovers. Problem with that is the Browns are tied for 26th with only eight defensive takeaways. Meantime, the Texans are tied for fourth with eight offensive giveaways.

Cox expects the airport will draw some 750,000 fewer passengers a year, down from more than 8 million now. With each passenger spending an average of $8 on newspapers, coffee, and the like, that could slice $6 million a year from spending at airport shops, in addition to lost landing fees from the airline.
October 2011: A suit brought by Cynthia Van Den Boom of Richmond, Va., was settled before trial was to start the following month. Van Den Boom, who was injected with Botox for neck pain, suffered brain damage, her attorney Ray Chester said. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.

The offense’s key wrinkle is that it aligns the quarterback between the center and the running back, as opposed to him being deeper in the traditional shotgun set with the back to either side. This formation allows the back to run to either side more effectively.

TL: For sure we will jump right into the controversy about what has happened with Rush Limbaugh and John & Ken. Now, you have the L.A. City Council weighing in on what constitutes "acceptable speech." I have a lot to say about that. All the fuss about the quarterback, Tim Tebow, who was just traded, will be on my list. And, I have a lot to say about social networking, which has come a long way since my last broadcast.
When the system works, it does enable the canny connoisseur to part-fund their cellar. A case of 2009 Pontet-Cantet bought en primeur will now realize the owner a few hundred pounds profit, which can be reinvested. But there are also a number of downsides to the system. In the past couple of years, release prices of en primeur wines have been very high, reducing the margin for the buyer. Also, in some cases, the en primeur price may actually fall once the wine arrives in bottle form. This has limited the appeal of the system. There have also been a few cases of unscrupulous merchants selling en primeur—only for the wines to never show up. It is always best to buy from an established merchant.
Matheny confirmed Craig is scheduled to play in the field in a game today for the first time this year.
Although Myanmar's military-backed government has released hundreds of well-known dissidents over the past year as part of a startling series of reforms that have earned it lavish praise and an easing of sanctions, rights advocates say hundreds more remain wrongfully locked away — their cases in danger of being forgotten amid rising hope for a more open, democratic nation.
Campbell was convicted in January in connection with the Oct. 11, 2009 carjacking in which she and a 17-year-old girl ambushed a 34-year-old Cator Avenue woman in the parking deck at Newport Centre Mall in Jersey City.
"Luckily, it's remained steady," said planner manager Rachael Fullenwider. "We'd lose one or two and then gain one or two when people were trying to find another source of work. When there were so many buildings going up, they didn't have to have this outlet; they were just handed jobs."
Not wanting to be to overly philosophical, but even the janitors that clean the building are part of the group. It is because of them that the audience enters a clean coliseum from the hockey game the night before and the band has clean dressing rooms.
The four players have hired defense attorney Nathan Fisher, who also attended the meeting with police but declined to be interviewed as he walked to his car afterward.

Out of respect to the film’s keep-it-simple ethos, though — or maybe just his lead’s limited range — Soderbergh hasn’t given Carano much to do except fight and look slightly impatient with the other characters. It’s as if every scene is another cage match to be gotten through.

Perjury is hard to sell to a jury, though. Earlier this year, federal prosecutors zealously pursued Barry Bonds, the steroid suspect who owns the all-time home run record, on charges he perjured himself about PED use before a grand jury. They came away only with a trifling obstruction of justice conviction, in part because evidence that was crucial to their case was excluded by the presiding judge's ruling.

The key, Todd says, was finding "the right match for tone and material." Her character's unusual past on "Samantha Who?" allows her to retain elements of the dumb-blond stereotype while simultaneously portraying a contemporary career woman -- a canny combination.
"I feel like I'm lying to you," said Lady Gaga to the sold-out house at Prudential Center in Newark. The pop star may tell us that she likes flattery better than the truth, but aesthetic dishonesty isn't her bag. On Friday night, she had new material she was burning to play, but it was off limits until "Born This Way," her upcoming set, hits retailers on May 23. So instead, she did what she's been doing for what seems like a pop eternity: she revisited the long-running Monster Ball for her faithful fans. At her piano, alone and vulnerable, she conceded that she wished she could go to sleep until release day.

Yet despite all of the positives, there are still those that say “The Rock and Brock Lesnar are taking a spot away from a younger superstar who is ready for the main event.” The fact is, both guys have elevated WWE interest to a whole new level and have brought in new crowds. Both of them feuding with Cena is brilliant. Cena needed this sort of outside support to elevate him and WWE even higher in the eyes of the mainstream. When The Rock and Lesnar say godbye, Cena is left with a bigger name and then it's time to have opponents like Dolph Ziggler and Cody Rhodes, who then look like even more legitimate main event players. With a little patience, fans will see that it's a win-win situation for everyone involved.

My earliest memory of the benefit of moderation was when I was about 9. My dad was seeing a nutritionist to lose weight, and the doctor told him, "Look, if you want to eat a doughnut or a candy bar, go right ahead. But buy the best one you can afford and just have one." That was a sea change in the way my dad approached food and a common-sense approach to eating that, I believe, speaks to moderation as a part of the solution to some of the health challenges plaguing Americans today.

The bank's net interest income of $10.9 billion was largely flat from the fourth quarter on slow loan growth, and up just about 2 percent from a year earlier. But the bank's $10.7 billion in non-interest income -- such as checking account fees, trading revenue and a variety of other revenue including mortgage fees -- jumped 11 percent from a year ago. The growth was largely driven by mortgage banking and a surprise lift from market-related activity, including investment banking.
You could blame the kids, but the Skins won on a play by one of their own. The pick-six by the rookie linebacker, Ryan Kerrigan, was the game-changer.

That's Julianne Johnson as Ma -- but it won't always be, during the Portland Playhouse production of "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom."Portland Playhouse will open its production of "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" Saturday night, but already tickets are getting hard to come by.

As The Oregonian has reported, planners have spent more than a million dollars a month for several years on project studies, mostly ignoring calls from members of Congress from the Northwest to dramatically scale back the project's scope and construction cost.

False. Obama may have support from a majority of Democrats in Congress, but it doesn't appear to be "strong" support.

Labeling genetically modified food could just as likely prod consumers to buy non-organic food that's not genetically modified as much as it would motivate consumers to purchase organic food, which is more expensive because it's produced on a smaller scale and requires more labor, said Timothy Lytton, a professor at Albany Law School who is writing a book about industry certification of kosher food.

Another association proposal is to eliminate professional development and training days for one year, which the group says would save the district $105,000.

It's an appropriate name. Sukhothai means "Dawn of Happiness" and was the first independent Thai kingdom, founded in the 13th century. Sukhothai Restaurant in Tampa didn't open until a little later, but it still represented the first giddily exotic Asian food for a lot of us. Sure, we'd had chow mein and egg rolls, but aromatic curries, tom ka gai lush with coconut milk and pad Thai with its rice noodles and crushed peanuts seemed all new. The restaurant's location was no accident — world travelers from nearby MacDill Air Force Base represented the first stalwart customers.

Well, the girls don't exactly stick to the script and they decide to perform "Cell Block Tango" from "Chicago," which is one of my favorite musical numbers, but that's besides the point. They look good, very good, especially Santana. I love it when she's all vixen-y! But they totally miss the point, as the song is about women killing their husbands. Oops.
Montage about the pressure of the season halfway through. People hurt. It's hard. They're tired. Nothing new to report. Oooh, we find out next week is "Classical Night."

Oh, wow, one of the dances is doing wire work, to enhance the feel of wind and breeze that's been in the dance so far. I think this is a "classical" version of Usher's "Without You." There were several familiar SYTYCD faces in that number. I love when the shows cross-pollinate like that.

Some money managers say the economic picture is muddled now because there are so many important issues that aren't settled.

The inn has a tavern, the Plucky, which is well-separated from the dining room. That means the sports crowd can cheer and moan as the game plays out on TV without disturbing serious eating. But several standards served at the Plucky, including fancy burgers ($16) and a pizzette ($14), also are available in the dining room (conversely, the dining room menu, not including the multi-course tasting menu, is available in the Plucky).

Pawlowicz proved me wrong as we hopped the subway to the Broadway/Lafayette stop, then effortlessly glided past the giant billboards of SoHo's northeast corner. A hard right off East Houston Street took us south on Mulberry Street, past NoLita's Young Designers Market and into Little Italy.

New Year’s Eve calls for a great band, but not every great band fits New Year’s Eve. Folk-rock is too sedate, power-pop too blunt, and synth-driven hits don’t carry the necessary grandeur. A New Year’s Eve band needs to be playful enough to fit the mood of a party but philosophical enough to commemorate the passage of time. It needs enough material to keep the crowd dancing for hours, and enough instrumental excellence to justify the extended jams.

Three small, thick slices of chicken breast took on a rich, rust-colored hue in achiote roast chicken ($10), and the meat was notable both for its remarkable moistness and a flavor of warm spices with a slight kick. The side of the long rectangular plate opposite the meat was lined with a pattern of pea sprouts, butternut squash cubes, prosciutto and candied pumpkin seeds.
Old investigative habits, however, return to Bernie with the fit of well-worn leather gloves. The disappearance of a young girl echoes an unsolved case from his days at the Alexanderplatz, prompting him to make connections between a possible serial killer running amok and an "Argentine brand of fascism" that Bernie discovers, to his surprise, even outdoes the Nazis. Kerr even has Bernie engaged in intellectual thrust and parry with Evita, "too cool, too businesslike, too efficient, too composed for [his] taste" and glittering with the excesses of her husband's dictatorship, but also a worthy ally in ways Bernie needs at opportune moments. And the prospect of mortality never looms larger for him, as his late middle age and an unexpected illness contrast sharply with the prospect of one final reach for love, however impossible.
However, Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who co-chaired the hearing, said green energy companies and solar manufacturers need reassurances that the state is committed to attaining aggressive renewable energy targets before they invest here.

Given their druthers, the folks in charge of the Getty's ancient theater program would have preferred something a little lighter. Staging a major outdoor production of an ancient play each September — the budget for "The Trojan Women" is about $400,000 — they like to alternate season by season between comedy and tragedy. This year was supposed to be comedy's turn.
"I see it all the time," said Mark Stebbings, Travaasa managing director. "People are totally drained when they arrive. They can hardly muster a friendly word, but within a couple of days, they're out enjoying life again. They need a place to recharge. This is it."
Nationally, about 17 percent of children and teens were obese in 2009 and 2010, the latest available data. That's about the same as at the beginning of the decade, though a closer look by Ogden shows continued small increases in boys, especially African-American boys.

Thank you for your strong support for the release of Senate Intelligence Committee's report on post-9/11 interrogation of detainees in U.S. custody.

Many of the issues, such as interracial dating or challenging parental authority, are universal. That's one reason Jittaun Batiste Jones, of San Jose, loves the book. The 33-year-old African-American is a convert to Islam and has been married to her Indonesian husband for eight years. She says it is refreshing to see issues of sex and intimacy discussed so openly among Muslim Americans.

Why the Indians continue to test Gordon -- no matter the situation -- is a mystery. Gordon extended his single-season club record with his 20th outfield assist, part of the Royals' major-league-leading 44. The Royals have thrown out 22 runners at the plate, also tops in the majors.

The change would cost the district about $700,000 -- that includes the loss of $500,000 in tuition, which would be offset somewhat by an increase in state aid, he said. Depending on enrollment, the district would need to hire an additional four to six teachers.

The current Broadway Series at PlayhouseSquare ends on a high note with "Next to Normal," a rock-music take on manic depression that won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 2010. But this is no ordinary touring company; it features Alice Ripley, who won the Tony Award for her deeply affecting depiction of Diana in the original production.
In the late '30s, the Owens family -- his parents, brother, two sisters and other relatives -- squeezed into a '33 Ford and left Sherman, Texas, heading West. The car broke down in Mesa, and they stayed with his great-aunt until they found work as sharecroppers. -- The Arizona Republic
Luce's food is as stark and graphic as a Josef Albers painting. Meats, fish and fowl are simply grilled or roasted and served without flourish. Like a modern artist, the chef centers the overly generous portion on an expansive white plate with nothing more than a sprig of herbs or lemon half for visual interest.
Martin Laird was solid for 33 holes and was the only player to reach double digits under par for the week. He was at 10 under with three holes to play when he lost four shots down the stretch.

Eastbound motorists on the Shoreway find scant instructions for reaching the station. A large overhead marker near East Ninth Street tells motorists to take the second right up ahead -- which sounds way simpler than it is while behind the wheel.
"I will challenge those who don't like the way I am using those resources, I challenge them to tell me how they would use them differently," the governor said. "And I've got an open door. If anyone wants to come in from the opposition party and sit down at my table, in my office and tell me what they would do with those resources that would be different than how I am using them, I will listen to them. I offer that to any of my detractors."
"I don't know why I just felt lucky. I was pulling for that from the beginning—14 or 15," said Hansen, whose horse by the same name starts with 10-1 odds as the fifth choice with no winner coming from No. 14 post in 51 years. "You have to breathe through times like that, but yeah, it was interesting. I had a good feeling, though."
All agree the resounding drop in property crime is likely tied to significant drops in methamphetamine labs, following state laws that forced Oregon pharmacies to keep pseudoephedrine behind the counter, require picture IDs for purchase and prescriptions for all pseudoephedrine products.
Ultimately, though, Tuesday’s vote was most about Obama, and about the country that sent him to the White House with great hopes, then watched in mounting frustration as unemployment increased despite his massive expansion of government spending and debt.

He broke Haase again to close out the match.
"When you walk around," he said, "you can really find a lot of things to eat. And every year is a little bit different.
"The Forgiveness of Blood"—hard to imagine a more unforgiving title—doesn't have a beautiful star, or an unforgettable sequence like the one in his earlier film when the heroine, a pregnant teenager turned drug mule, must swallow scores of plastic capsules containing heroin. The hero, Nik, is a gawky 15-year-old with a crush on a high-school beauty; he's played by a novice Albanian actor named Tristan Halilaj. (Most members of the cast hadn't acted before, though you'd never know it from the fine performances.) But the film has much to recommend it, starting with Mr. Marston's decision to put Nik at the center of the action. Just as "Maria Full of Grace" was mainly about Maria, rather than the Colombian drug trade, this new one explores an exotic—and sclerotic—culture from the standpoint of a contemporary kid who finds himself imprisoned by antiquated rules he never agreed to in a two-bit town where no insult, however slight, is ever forgotten.

However, HCHA interim CEO Tom McCasland informed board chairman Beto Cardenas on March 28 that the agency had no unrestricted cash on hand to make the payment.
Hockney will, though: He plans to drop in on L.A. this month for the Oscars and the parties. He's not done yet with working in England, and he still holds only a green card for U.S. residency after all these years (he's not "respectable" enough for American citizenship, he says), but Southern California will always beckon.
The Portage County commissioners, who serve four-year terms, handle the budget and levy taxes. Early voting in the Democratic primary March 6 has begun.

SACRAMENTO – California lawmakers are the latest politicians to don hoodies to protest the killing of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, after an Illinois representative was reprimanded for wearing a hooded sweatshirt a day earlier.

Under the ordinance, introduced by the borough council earlier this month, council would have a year to decide whether to acquire and preserve land for a right-of-way along the Dinky tracks.
And you would. Except, right now, Qualls is the second man on the totem pole. One night after allowing two runs to tied the game, the veteran righthander bounced back to pitch a scoreless eighth. Yet Manuel cannot live on Qualls alone, just as he did not live on Madson alone, or Lidge alone. A good bullpen is like a third-and-15 coverage scheme: three-deep. Park, Durbin, Contreras all were big strikeout arms the Phillies leaned heavily upon.
Clooney's character is a liberal governor from Pennsylvania running for president who impregnates a campaign worker. The woman then seeks an abortion. That much, said Austin, is believable, which drew a chuckle from a few observers.
Domestic Relations Judge
Data presented Monday at a major CDC meeting paint something of a mixed picture of the obesity battle. There's some progress: Clearly, the skyrocketing rises in obesity rates of the 1980s and '90s have ended. But Americans aren't getting thinner.

Romney’s favorability ratings slumped dramatically over the course of a bruising primary campaign, where he often eked out victories after pouring millions of dollars into advertising attacking his opponents.

Pinkerman enumerates a long list of reasons for area residents to frequent the marketplace. She explains that the products are fresh, local and healthier than those at nearby supermarket chains. She comments on the diversity of items and the social aspects of the market. She advocates for local businesses and the historic downtown. Still, her most convincing argument for the event may simply be that "it is the best little market out there."

"We want all four of our elementary schools to compete not only with the schools in our DFG but with the best schools in the state."
That doesn't necessarily mean total education spending would decline. The state could increase per-student funding levels, and the legal student population is expected to grow. Also, Pew estimates that 60 percent of the children of illegal immigrants are U.S. citizens, suggesting that some, especially older students, may remain in Arizona even if their families leave.
After headquarters radioed that we could "take the day off!", two of us walked from the edge of the village further along the street. We were stopped everywhere. We could walk no more than a few feet before being embraced.
This new tablet comes with a paltry amount of memory. It is packaged with a 2 gigabyte removable memory card and 4 gigabytes of internal storage, of which just 1.8 gigabytes is available to the user. That is a total of less than 4GB, versus 16GB for the base iPad. You can buy a larger memory card, up to 32GB, but that adds about $30 in cost.

Watson - they didn't call it and you could probably make the argument that they tried to foul him twice -- and Watson, obviously, not having been in that situation and that pressure moment, made a decision that I'm sure if he could have it back again, he would dribble it out and wait for them to foul him since he's an 81% free throw shooter.
