Mike Acker: Elliot Williams is like the opposite of Luke Babbitt in my mind. Whereas Babbitt didn’t play much and might get shipped as a result, Williams didn’t play at all, and will probably get at least one more year in a Blazer jersey because of it. What we know of Williams is limited to a few preseason appearances, which to be honest were not great, and what can be extrapolated via watching him play in college. He’s athletic and young, both good things, and now has a “history of injuries,” which is not a good thing. Hopefully Williams can contribute when he gets back to one hundred percent. I just think you can’t try to move him without at least giving him half a look.

I absolutely refuse to believe that the anti-immigrant crowd makes any distinction between legal and illegal immigrants. How can they tell the difference?

Across town, another world premiere is being readied. The Yale Repertory Theatre has enlisted a high-powered cast — indie film goddess Parker Posey, Steppenwolf Theatre ensemble member (and Pulitzer-winning playwright) Tracy Letts, Johanna Day (a Tony nominee for Proof) and Glen Fitzgerald (Brian Darling on TV's "Dirty Sexy Money") — for its world premiere of Will Eno's The Realistic Joneses, April 20-May 12.

* Peggy's Work/Life Balance: We've already heard Peggy wonder if her commitment to work makes her seem more like a man than a woman, and her boyfriend, Abe, isn't helping her internal struggle any. As she gets up to go to work, he's still in bed, suggesting they go see the movie, "The Naked Prey." But Peggy's obsessed with the Heinz presentation, since those bean counters are the clients from Hell. Abe is ticked off that she keeps focusing on work, and tells her to have a bleepy day. After all this, when Peggy does get to work, Don drops out of the presentation to take Megan upstate to a Howard Johnson's for a work-related trip, and when the Heinz guy doesn't like Peggy's pitch, her attempt at changing his mind through some sort of ninja thought domination results in her getting pulled from the account. She glugs down some whiskey, and goes to the movies, to see "Born Free," and winds up sharing a joint with a stranger, who she then, er, gratifies there in the dark.

Echoing an older work, "Video Plant" - in which an image of a spindly flora specimen screened on five stacked TV monitors hilariously channels the mundane and the strange - the five-channel video sculpture "Video Stereo" mimics a midcentury stereo console as reality bumps up against reproduction. One screen plays a video of a record spinning on a turntable, twin screens depict speakers from which music drawn from Pieper's vinyl collection pours and dual screens present the cover - in one case, Eric Burdon and the Animals' trippily impressionistic "San Franciscan Nights."

These five, plus senior sixth man Darius Miller, will be drafted in June. That is what Calipari is selling to players, and selling it better than anyone – the express lane to NBA riches."

We're now responding with engines and trucks and multiple personnel who are cross-trained. … It's more expensive in terms of what it costs for that response than it was when we set the fees for what we charge. ... I'm not saying we should be dunning people who can't afford service. But in many instances - most instances - there are insurance carriers that will pay for these emergencies. We have to figure out what the real cost is and start increasing charges."

This is what "Hell on Wheels" attempts to take to a new level, but it is hopelessly weighed down by well-worn saddle bags stuffed with leaden performances and sodden storytelling.

For the rest of you, this mystery emerged -- coincidentally around the time of this year's Academy Awards -- when I came across an old photo (circa 1980) of my mom proudly holding an actual Oscar statuette in what appeared to be some sort of bland-looking office setting.

What is especially striking is how completely Wade has become James' chaperone. James, a man who wears wrist bands with the words "King James" on them, shot glances at Wade Sunday night when tough questions came their way, deferring again and again. This, all in all, is probably for the best.
Steven Anderson, president of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, and Doug Hoey, chief executive of the National Community Pharmacists Association, expressed disappointment in the FTC decision.

Humanity seems fated to learn and relearn that last lesson, always too late. Rome, the Eternal City, was pillaged in 410.

Stapleton: This is true they have struggled the past two seasons, but you can not completely blame the offensive line coach. It may seem like I’m being defensive of Coach Flood but the truth of the matter is he has been coaching the same stuff for the last seven years at Rutgers in that period he's had a line which I was apart of that gave up just 8 sacks for the season, he has had 6 linemen make NFL rosters. The new wave of linemen that are coming thru Rutgers are better athletes than me and the ones I played with, but they the players need to learn how to play as ONE unit, something the guys I played with understood and we prided ourselves on being the best and striving to get better!

The scoop: Owner Charles Bartell made ice cream for supermarkets like Giant Eagle before he opened the red- and white-enameled gelato shop of his dreams. Since October, he's been making his own cream base for gelato with imported Italian flavorings, such as hazelnut from the Piedmont region. Fruit sorbettos are also made in-house, sometimes from a cantaloupe ripening to sweetness in the window. The flat-screen TV and still photographs play all Italian images all the time. The lick: Carmelatte (fragrant, milky caramel), coffee (fresh, warm flavor), chocolate hazelnut praline (heavenly crunch), lemon biscotti (ice cream and cookie) and zesty pink grapefruit and raspberry-lemon sorbettos.

The Rams haven't sold tickets because they've been a stinking mess on the field, and because the billionaire owner won't commit to St. Louis long-term. Tebow could fix all of that? Please. I know he's popular, but let's not get carried away. This franchise won't be a hot ticket again unless Fisher/Snead/Demoff start to show they're turning things around, and unless Kroenke makes it clear that the Rams aren't moving to Los Angeles. Anything beyond that is background noise.
Baltimore officials, including Ms. Rawlings-Blake, have been promising to get tough on tax cheats for years, and it's crucial that they follow through, both because the city needs every dime it's legally entitled to and as a matter of fairness to those who do pay all the taxes they owe.

When it comes to generating goodwill between a company, its customers and prospects -- the very essence of public relations -- it's a buyer's market for small businesses. Much as the Web has enabled entrepreneurs to sell products independent of bricks-and-mortar retailers and their limited shelf space, so too is it letting them engage the public without the mainstream press or the spinners who court it.
