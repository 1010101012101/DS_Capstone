"Everybody told me that. And yeah, I was concerned. But to be frank, while she does have a personal liberal agenda, she does not impose that on this body. She would never have gotten her energy bill through if she had. The Recovery Act represents the work of the members, not her. I'll say the same thing on the health care legislation."

Thankfully, a band of fiscal hawks in Congress are at long last embracing the GAO's repeated recommendations to make this common-sense change. Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, Republican Sens. Mike Enzi of Wyoming, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and John McCain of Arizona, and Rep. David Schweikert, an Arizona Republican, recently introduced the bipartisan COINS Act to eliminate the $1 bill and move fully to a $1 coin. These legislators are true leaders who are unafraid to take on a reluctant bureaucracy and entrenched special interests to find a creative way to reduce the deficit. Now, it's time for more of our leaders to get on board — including our Maryland congressional delegation.
Novitzky earlier gave perhaps an unexpected boost to the government when he answered a question by speaking of a connection he made between Clemens and performance-enhancing drugs. It came during his answer about his 2005 investigation of Kirk Radomski, the former New York Mets batboy who has admitted providing drugs to dozens of players.
The projects got a jump start in January 2010 when SMUD received $1.6 million in federal Energy Department and state Energy Commission grants. The utility has also spent about $500,000 of its own and has received $500,000 from a San Jose solar firm. Last month, the SMUD board adopted the initial environmental impact studies and reports required under CEQA. It also took more than a year to negotiate leases with Caltrans. SMUD is now seeking a private owner-operator, while Caltrans is waiting for the Federal Highway Administration to sign off so it can work with the private firm on permits to use state land.

You would not have known last season at this time that McCoy would become the franchise leader so soon. Browns President Mike Holmgren had his swinnnnng-and-a-miss hunch that Jake Delhomme was not a shell-shocked, over-the-hill quarterback.

I Twittered about that a little bit, just to say thank you to people. What happened is my fancy little car, which after 10 years of skating as a pro I bought for myself, leaked. It was a soft-top convertible, and it was parked on an incline, and there was a massive amount of water in the back. So being a country kid, I try to figure out how to solve this problem myself. So every once in a while, I'd go down in the garage and set up the leaf blower and just let the air blow underneath the carpets and dry it out, so that no mold would come into play. And the third day, my theory is that it was pretty dry, because something went wrong, either the leaf blower sparked, or it got overheated, or it slipped, because I had it tied it off so it wouldn't move, but maybe it plugged either one end or the other and overheated. My cellphone went off, so I left the garage so I could hear, and then I heard the garage door open. I thought, "That's really weird. Why would the garage door open?" I opened it up, and the car was engulfed in flames. The fire department was under restoration. They didn't come for about 16, 17, 18 minutes. And that was enough. The fire took hold from the basement into our living room, into our bedroom, into the roof and burned most of the roof off the house. And five and a half hours later, they had it under control. So I was just trying to get my car dry. It's dry now.

The situation may have seemed dire at the time. Staying involved with basketball was Holden’s No. 1 priority after finishing his Terps career, and the abrupt end to his coaching career was a definite shock to his system. But armed with his Maryland degree -- and a connection from his basketball past -- Holden rebounded in a hurry. Ten years after winning a national title, Holden has embarked on a new career as an analyst for a global financial services company in Jersey City, not far from where he grew up. And Holden has stayed involved with the game he loves as a coach for his former youth team.

This is also according to advice I've given others: We're flawed, all of us, and hoping to find an ideal person is not only pointless, it's also dehumanizing to people to expect them to meet your ideals. All you can realistically hope for are people who are self-aware enough and responsible enough to try to keep their frailties in check.
Here at home, the days and months after 9/11 evoked an unabashed sense of patriotism and national unity not seen since World War II. Americans traveled to Ground Zero to help with the cleanup or simply to comfort the grieving. They flew flags and gathered in churches to pray for the dead and for their country. Enlistments in the military and other avenues of service soared. Members of Congress sang "God Bless, America" on the steps of the Capitol. President George W. Bush proved to be an inclusive conciliator, and Al Gore -- the man many believe should have occupied the Oval Office -- said he was proud to call Bush "my commander in chief."

It's going to be a vibrant, raucous audience. In terms of how we build out, though, there's no question our success hinges on going out and indeed getting some of the sports fans who are not yet soccer fans.

They have more season ticket holders than the Mariners. It's the new thing. It's the hip thing.

Answer: I developed a 3-point shot the last year and half, so this summer it was a pump-fake, one-dribble, pull-up jump shot. With all the athleticism in guys, it's kind of hard for me to get to the rim all the way. So to master a one-dribble pull-up is big for me. So you'll see a lot more of that and you'll see me attacking a little more and trying to be a playmaker when it's open.

In addition to running for the Senate, Novick sought appointment as state treasurer in 2010, losing to Ted Wheeler, and then briefly considered running for Multnomah County chairman. He has also worked for former Gov. Ted Kulongoski and former Multnomah County Chairwoman Diane Linn.
The way Google keeps documents in its data centers requires the company to obtain a license to "host, store (and) reproduce" the files. If, say, a screenwriter in China uses Google's services to collaborate on a movie script written in Mandarin with a script editor in Hollywood who only reads English, Google needs the rights for "translations, adaptations or other changes" to allow the two writers to work on the document in different languages and make revisions.

Dan, I don't share your faith that the national interest would have been better served if GM had gone through an ordinary bankruptcy process. Without government funding to keep GM in business during a bankruptcy, the automaker wouldn't have been able to remain a going concern. GM would have been unable to obtain private loans to stay open during a long, drawn-out court proceeding. Its assets would eventually have been sold off piecemeal with auto suppliers throughout the nation forced to close as they lost GM business, and there most likely would not have been a "New GM" for a new owner to take over.
Growing up in St. Louis (Mo.), Hollywood or New York City felt very far away. I so wished that I had some portal into that world. When I'm tweeting or writing blogs I'm hoping that I can give a glimpse of what it's like to some other girl or boy who wants to be an actor. I imagine how excited my 14-year-old self would be if I could get advice about that world from someone.

Political comparisons are apt, as the basis of Anonymous, written by John Orloff, is that de Vere aimed to use his dramas to rouse the rabble and raise his illegitimate son to be Queen Elizabeth's successor. Like many Shakespeare plays, the pretext of Anonymous is royal succession. Who shall succeed Queen Elizabeth (Vanessa Redgrave)? Will it be James of Scotland, son of Elizabeth's cousin and political rival Mary, Queen of Scots, or the Earl of Southampton, Oxford's illegitimate son?

State Sen. Joseph Vitale (D-Middlesex) was the first to raise a stink, saying Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex), leader of the Democrats’ redistricting team, wanted to further his own career by pitting Vitale against Senate Majority Leader Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex). That would create a district stretching from Perth Amboy to New Brunswick, with the aim of slightly increasing its Hispanic population. But it would also open up a Senate seat for Wisniewski if he wanted to pursue it.

The earlier model, under which retailers could set their own price, enabled Amazon to sell e-books at a loss, a difference it looked to more than make up with profits on Kindle and other merchandise. Under the so-called "agency model" negotiated with Apple, publishers can set the price at which e-book retailers could sell their wares, often at $2 or more than Amazon's usual $9.99 price, with Apple getting 30 percent of the cut.
King's shorts have played festivals from Kentucky to the Caribbean, winning awards along the way.

Rosenstock's play might not have a title suitable for a family publication, but it had one heck of a great cast, willing and able to dive head-first into it's antic world of warped desire. Maher again was a standout, sending the crowd into paroxysms of stunned laughter as a man working through his emotional problems by taking a writing course. (As it turns out, he's assigned to write about the Greek myth of a Spartan queen seduced by a swan, and one of his problems is an unhealthy sexual interest in his neighbor's cat.) The show-stopping moment, though, came from Tim True as a Greek slave impersonating a bird. Flapping his arms, running about the stage and perching behind Burch as the queen, he made his fellow cast members nearly dissolve into laughter. Everyone had to take half a minute to compose themselves before the action could continue.

A complicating factor in the state's surplus-revenue picture is a $500 million payment from the state's private economic development wing -- JobsOhio -- which is tied up in a court case. Keen called it "a very real possibility" the state won't get the payment this year, which would open up a $500 million hole in the budget that he would need to close.
"You don't like to react to what other people do," he said of Americans, and that suggests a strategy of imposing a style on opponents.

That's the theory. What's the execution? Even with No. 1 running back Dan Herron suspended for five games, the Buckeyes have four legitimate options in smaller backs Berry and junior Jordan Hall and bigger backs sophomore Carlos Hyde and freshman Rod Smith. In the parlance of former coach Jim Tressel, the Buckeyes once again should be looking for a pair and a spare. That's why the decisions in the backfield coming into focus this week are so crucial.

All the players would not only play on the team, but they would work at Lingo's dog kennels in Ohio. Since LaRue did not even have a football field, the Indians were mostly a traveling squad. By this point, Lingo's dog kennel had expanded into a large mail-order business, selling dogs for over $100 apiece (an exorbitant amount of money at the time. To put it into perspective, note that the franchise fee for an NFL team was just $100). So the Indians worked as a traveling advertisement for his mail-order business. It was only at Thorpe's insistence that the men be given an occasional break that Lingo agreed to have the occasional "home" game (since LaRue did not have a field, they had to play in nearby Marion, Ohio).

Anything that sounds too good to be true probably isn't true.

The government's strong preference is for banks in need of fresh capital to raise it either through private investors or selling assets, officials say. That won't be an option for certain weaker banks, who may have to give the government big stakes in their common equity to boost capital levels.

There is a stark difference between Protestant and Catholic believers. Many Protestant leaders are in the forefront of demanding ultimate punishment. Official Catholic policy condemns the death penalty. Perhaps the strongest argument against the death penalty is extreme bias against the poor, minorities or those with diminished mental capacity. Although homicide victims are six times more likely to be black rather than white, 77 percent of death penalty cases involve white victims. Also, it is hard to imagine a rich white person going to the death chamber after being defended by expensive lawyers. This demonstrates a higher value placed on the lives of white Americans.

CLEVELAND, Ohio -- I once yelped, quite loudly, "Oh, my God!" in a press box. It wasn't after I had hot coffee spilled down my back, either. I am ashamed to say it was after LeBron James hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to beat Orlando in the playoffs.
MY: Ha ha! Yes, that's become my new motto. I've also been using, "Making waves in feminism one anal scene at time." I made my way into porn years ago to support the gallery. I'm most well-known as an international bondage model for my intense suspensions and for being quite the "pain slut." I've traveled around the world working with some of the best bondage artists and fetish photographers. I also started my own network of Web sites: KinkNextDoor.com, that includes Tied4Sex.com and MadisonBound.com. In an effort to stay closer to home and the gallery, I've traded in my passport for Los Angeles' "porn valley." In the last five months I've been shooting in Los Angeles with companies like Hustler, Penthouse, Digital Playground, Club Jenna, Terravision, Red Light and Evil Angel. We do have grant funding and private funders for Femina Potens, but until funding increases it is a question of "How many anal scenes does it take to open a feminist art gallery?"

"I don't think I've ever worked so hard on something, but working on Macintosh was the neatest experience of my life. Almost everyone who worked on it will say that. None of us wanted to release it at the end. It was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands, it wouldn't be ours anymore. When we finally presented it at the shareholders' meeting, everyone in the auditorium stood up and gave it a 5-minute ovation. What was incredible to me was that I could see the Mac team in the first few rows. It was as though none of us could believe that we'd actually finished it. Everyone started crying."
This is happening at a time when recent grads are finding it particularly hard to find work, not just in their chosen fields, but anywhere.

The Department of Education put the default rate at 8.8 percent of student borrowers as of September 2010.

It's hard to make an impression with tuna tartare these days, since it's become the creme brulée of appetizers. But Keane's flawlessly composed dices of fish are studded with celery root and black radish, all shimmering in a dark varnish of soy, lemon and truffle vinaigrette.

Halak has the inside track on being the postseason starter. He began the season as the team's No. 1 goalie and, considering the Blues' investment in him - an average salary of $3.75 million for the next two seasons - still has to be considered that. He also has been there and done that. He has appeared in 21 postseason games with a 2.49 goals-against average and led Montreal to the Eastern Conference finals in 2009-10, when he pulled an Elliott and jumped past No. 1 keeper Carey Price and became a well-paid star. Elliott has a shorter résumé, with four playoff games for Ottawa that same postseason and a 4.14 GAA.

That she made it to 45 - which she turned Tuesday - registers as something of a small miracle, and she is the first to admit it. Her pals Kurt Cobain (Love's husband, of Nirvana) and Hole bassist Kristen Pfaff, who both died in 1994, weren't so lucky.
The hole they dug themselves in the early going of their first-round series against the Coyotes eventually proved too deep as the Hawks were eliminated with a 4-0 loss in Game 6 on Monday night at the United Center.

But, as many opponents of the bill noted in speeches that amounted to a tactical retreat, this debate is far from over. As uncertain as the prospects for this legislation were even in the moments before Friday's vote, its ultimate fate hinges now on a process that is even less certain. Advocates spent the last 11 months working to win a handful of undecided delegates. Now it looks like they will have less than nine months to win over hundreds of thousands of Maryland voters.
The Frank Mickadeit 2008 Winter Tour has been booked at public libraries for Jan. 21 (Fullerton), Jan. 23 (San Juan Capistrano) and Jan. 28 (Fountain Valley). I've been working with three women, The Real Librarians of Orange County, to bring you an evening of readings, two original songs, including "Home Depot Woman," and a press conference in which you're the reporters. Somewhat reminiscent of my historic 2005 Starbucks tour without the corporate grief. Or the Chantico. Details to follow.
Founded by a Civil War amputee, Hanger Clinic is the same nationwide company that made a prosthetic tail for a bottlenose dolphin named Winter that was featured in a film called "Dolphin Tale."

But she also had a cherished life outside of public office. Davis was an avid painter who won several awards and served on the executive board of the Summit Art Center, now called Visual Arts Center of New Jersey. She volunteered on the Essex County Welfare Board before running for office. And she especially enjoyed get-togethers with her family, which grew from three children to six after her husband, Herbert, died in 1980 and she married Morton Davis, a widower with three daughters, said her son.

Because of these absences, Colangelo said he's putting heavy emphasis on filling the team's front line and looking for players who are "versatile enough to play a couple of positions." But the possibilities remain unclear. Colangelo said USA Basketball officials might choose from their 16-man roster, which features frontcourt players in Tyson Chandler, Chris Bosh, Kevin Love and Blake Griffin. Colangelo also said he's open to adding extra players.
Quite frankly I am shocked it was Biruta who has decided to leave. No question he gave everything he had every night. Teams need players with the kind of passion that he brings each game. That being said, I thought he was a bit slow on defense and tended to get beat a lot so he would use his hands to defend hence all the fouls. I'm not sure he can hang with the quicker big men. He was inconsistent around the basket, too, missing some easy shots there hurt, especially the first Seton Hall game. I do love his heart, though, and wish him well. I wish he would have stayed. I think he can contribute much to this team still.
Midfielder Darlington Nagbe is now running at full speed and lightly kicking a ball around. Nagbe had successful surgery to repair a sports hernia March 4. He is rehabilitating and said he hopes to play in the Timbers' game at New England April 2.

So, did she eat a lot of scrambled eggs along the way? Not really, said Long, who made a handful of egg ornaments this year and one or two dozen in more-crafty years. Often, she did use the contents of the chicken eggs for cooking or baking, but the goose and duck eggs had too strong a flavor, she said.

The most important action would be to stop stealing the people's money and providing the necessary oversight so that elected officials no longer use their political office for personal gain. There is no single action that county government could do to restore the public's confidence. Trust is built over time, and it will therefore take time to reestablish trust from the people.
Jennifer Spangler, who had lived in the apartments, testified Friday that a woman from the leasing office asked her not to tell the Findlays about the death. She told the judge she kept the secret until moving out, to avoid trouble with management.

Under Johnson, an important Democratic operative, Fannie Mae became, Morgenson and Rosner say, “the largest and most powerful financial institution in the world.” Its power derived from the unstated certainty that the government would be ultimately liable for Fannie’s obligations. This assumption and other perquisites were subsidies to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac worth an estimated $7 billion a year. They retained about a third of this.

This is not the case with every dish. But I found myself thinking that many of these plates can be found in versions with deeper tastes at other local Asian restaurants, like Biwa (skewered and grilled items), Pok Pok (chicken wings), Ping (aromatic stews), Wong's King (dim sum) and Du Kuh Bee (noodles). Granted, the offerings are "modern" versions of traditional Asian cooking. But upscale, sumptuously aesthetic "street food" can seem oxymoronic, especially if you think seriously about the Mongolian steppes. And a "B.L.T.," two cherry tomatoes wrapped in peppered bacon and consumed in a single molten mouthful, is a 1950s cocktail hors d'oeuvre rather than something you'd find on the streets of Shanghai.
"The AMA has long-standing policy opposing the expansion of Medicare given the fiscal projections for the future," said the group's president, Dr. James Rohack.

The decimated manufacturing sector is just now starting to pick itself off the mat. St. Louis factories added 4,000 jobs in the past year, according to preliminary government estimates. That replaced some of the 35,000 manufacturing jobs lost from the start of the recession until local factories hit bottom in late 2009.
UMass (17-4, 5-2 Atlantic 10) took a 45-26 lead into the half built on a 22-5 run over the last 8:05. Raphiael Putney scored 10 of his game-high 22 points during the stretch and UMass pushed the lead past the point of no return.

Additionally, the ongoing energy bills can be viewed by the homeowner on their own personal dashboard. Since Green Button information sharing can provide energy use before and after improvements, they can see how much money energy upgrades have actually saved them and continue to think about additional improvements.
Ironically, it was McCain's home state that reignited the immigration issue after the state Legislature passed a law that gives police far more leeway to detain people suspected of being in the country illegally. A secondary goal of the Arizona religious leaders' trip to Washington is to persuade the Justice Department to delay implementation of that law to allow time for Congress to act.

"If he legally can, he almost certainly will get more money," Ganis said. "But I'm not sure that's something entirely within his purview. There are some contracts involved.

It is quite possible. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has been wary of the court’s ruling too soon on broad questions.

Look closer. On the one hand, here is the astounding reach and power of this rare and striking little film, an emotional tinderbox of a movie that, in the wrong hands or with the wrong marketing or if it had been off pitch by just this much, could have very easily been trashed and quickly dismissed, hobbled the careers of two up-and-coming hunk actors and mocked across the board and demonized by the religious right as revolting gay propaganda, the source of all ills, proof of the existence of the devil himself.

Nor for the private sector to get us back into orbit, as Obama assumes it will. True, hauling MREs up and trash back down could be done by private vehicles.
