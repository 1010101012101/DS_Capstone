Opening day
Brantley led off the third with a single. He sprinted for second twice as Kipnis hit full-count foul balls. The third time, Kipnis swung and missed as Brantley did not get as good of a jump. Catcher Chris Iannetta's throw to second was on-target for the first of two K/2-6's against Cleveland. In the top of the fourth, Hunter hit a two-out homer to right for a 2-0 advantage. When right-handed hitters take Masterson deep, it's news.

Boulevard Drinks, 48 Journal Square, Jersey City; (201) 656-1855. If Hollywood ever made a hot dog thriller, it should use Boulevard Drinks in Jersey City as a stage set. Its flickering red and green neon sign, walk-up counter and bright yellow/orange interior is right out of central hot dog casting. But there’s more going for Boulevard Drinks than atmosphere. The hot dogs are good, and the conversation lively. "What temperature do you keep the grill?" a customer once asked.

If ever a movie were meant for 3-D, it’s “Pina,’’ which captures the thrill of sensual, lithe bodies leaping and diving off the screen into viewers’ arms and laps. Some numbers take place onstage, but the 3-D is best when the dancers, in fabulous evening wear, move into the great outdoors of the German city Wuppertal.

The Iraqis have suffered for nine years as a result of the U.S. invasion and occupation. The economic, educational and political systems in Iraq have been destroyed.

No Iraqi politicians want to openly be identified as pro-American.

The 2009 abandonment of the once-ballyhooed "Escalera Nautica" project, which aimed to create a route of marinas and tourist sites up and down the Baja peninsula, and the sputtering, three-decade history of the still-unrealized Loreto Bay project, would seem to argue against the Cabo Pulmo development on financial as well as environmental grounds.
Schultz, 62, and Curley, 57, stepped down from their posts late Sunday, one day after the charges were announced. Today, they appeared in a Harrisburg courtroom, where a judge set bail at $75,000. They weren’t required to enter pleas, but they had to surrender their passports.

While personalities from radio, TV, sports, print media, politics and the corporate world fumbled around as servers - the Crisis Nursery's 20th annual Celebrity Waitresses' & Waiters' Night event raked in more than $70,000 to save babies and keep kids safe.

As a member of Friends of President Station and a neighborhood resident who has worked tirelessly with many others to create the Baltimore Civil War Museum, I'm incredulous this historic building is now on the "neglected" list ("City eyeing sale of 15 sites," March 21). It's a unique museum/education venue not far from City Hall. It might behoove our local movers and shakers to stroll down to the harbor and have a look. The Civil War Museum is hardly neglected. Hundreds visit each month, admire the artifacts we've gathered over the years, watch a film, enjoy a personalized, guided tour and then shop for National Park's sanctioned Civil War souvenirs.
Cordray, 51, didn’t expect to be among those names. His well-financed campaign focused on his track record of fighting Wall Street. His office’s lawsuits against financial giants like AIG, bond rating agencies, subprime lenders and others have resulted in more than $1 billion in legal settlements.
So while the Raiders were proud to say that last year they would have lost a game like this one, the Texans once again were left facing the hard truth that they could lose such a game this year. Just like last year and the year before that and so on.

The slight soldier wore a dress uniform during the proceeding before military judge Col. Denise Lind. He sat at a table with his civilian attorney and two military attorneys, and spoke only to affirm that he understood his rights and to name the members of his defense team.
Hey, Dave: I think the Cavs are trying to develop a possible back-up point guard for Kyrie Irving and giving opportunities to guys like Donald Sloan and Hudson. It appears they do not believe Harris is in that category. Harris, however, did start at shooting guard Friday night.

One day, displays at garden centers and big-box stores are a blur of everyday green houseplants, then suddenly there's a burst of brilliant white as the trumpet-shaped, fragrant blooms are all about. Although we've been treated to outdoor spring flowers earlier this year, and our eyes aren't quite as winter-weary as usual, Easter lilies are still quite the eye candy when they show up to enliven windowsills and Easter Sunday dinner tables.
Still, it's too expensive. I'm starting a campaign against high-priced wine lists, so on two of my three visits, I refused to order wine and stuck with aperitifs and mixed drinks. I know the markups are also high on these products -- a margarita and gimlet for $9, a version of Bloody Mary for $9.50, for example -- but at least there's some in-house artistry involved. With wine, the restaurateur pays for the artistry of the winemaker, and what's passed on is the cost of storing and serving. If a restaurant doesn't offer exceptional service or numerous vintages of hard-to-find labels, then a markup of 2 to 2 1/2 times the retail price is all that's justified.
The crux of opponents' arguments is that only the federal government has the authority to regulate immigration.
Test scheduling and "human error" led to the problem for seventh-graders, and attendance issues complicated the participation for juniors, said Maureen Wheeler, district spokeswoman.
I watched James warm up closely against Miami 10 days ago. He curtailed all the showboating before the critical Orlando game on Thursday, but the Cavs knew they could take the Heat, even if Dwyane Wade had a big night. James threw the ball 30 feet in the air from midcourt, putting a wicked spin on it as it came off his hands, then raced in, played the sideways hop perfectly in the lane, and twisted into a reverse slam. He dunked here, there, and everywhere, laughing, joking, enjoying himself immensely. He didn't seem too concerned with injury.
"But, they are all debatable," he said.
"There's a lot of frustration over the federal government's inability to solve the problem," Giffords said. "They've done a much better job managing Southern California and southern Texas. This has not happened overnight. This has been years and years of neglect."
Memphis arrived at Staples Center having lost five of its last six games, a skid that started with a double-overtime home loss against the Lakers on March 13.
"My fastball command was good," Blanton said. "That's huge because you're able to get ahead of hitters and it makes your offspeed pitches better."
James’ rep announced on Tuesday that the former “Monster Garage” star checked into rehab to deal with “personal issues” after realizing “that this time was crucial to help himself, help his family and help save his marriage.”

Luke reports that even before she is pregnant, an alpha female knows the number of pups she will birth, their sex, and whether they will stay with her or go live elsewhere. While stalking a moose, the alpha stations two of her hunters at the prey's shoulders to assess its heart rate, a strategy that helps her decide when the kill should be made.

Playboy named her "America's Sexiest Bartender" in 2010. "'Playboy' liked my story -- you know, the girl from the small town," she says. That town is LaGrange -- and it isn't just a story. Lottman chose to work at family-owned laid-back Porcelli's over loud downtown woohoo parlors. She does like to ride a Harley, something she learned back in LaGrange.

Several people told me mid-Indy Car that the ALMS race was far more exciting.

Much of the action in Larsson's tales takes place in a hipper, more contemporary district: Sodermalm. And action is the right word. Larsson's books - as with Hollywood's take on "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" - exemplify the maxim that action is character. His prose is muscular, propulsive, his descriptive writing spare. That is one reason I want to see Larsson's locations for myself: He tells us their names, but not much about what they look like or feel like.

"Embryo, seed coat, endosperm: what is a seed if not the purest kind of memory, a link to every generation that has gone before it?" thinks the seed keeper, pondering her place in the universe, which has been rendered obsolete in an instant, the instant in which the water began to flow. Reading that, it's impossible not to think of the woman from Wyoming, who puts her hope in embryonic implantation, itself a kind of seeding, even as she tells herself, "Nothingness is the permanent thing. Nothingness is the rule. Life is the exception."

Along with its two languages, music (by Dmitry Volkov) and movement figure importantly in the production. The spoken dialogue is all assigned to the two main characters. The supporting players sing and perform the instrumental score. Live music, as Baryshnikov rightly points out, "is a rarity of modern theater."
Once under way, the car will revert to electric power up to 62 mph, as long as there's juice in the battery and the load demands aren't too high. When the batts are depleted, the gas engine fires up again—and again, and again, as you drive down the highway. This sawing back and forth of electrons and hydrocarbons takes some getting used to; the nice part is that, at around-town speeds, the car performs almost like an all-electric EV—so much so that Kia engineers created a prerecorded engine sound to alert pedestrians of the car's otherwise-silent presence. That's kind of cool.

But U.S. officials were unable to secure the extradition of San Diego County taco restaurant owner and murder suspect Abelardo "Larry" Tasa from the Philippines, even after he was arrested there.
The verdict came shortly after jurors sent the judge a note saying they were split, though they did not say they were hopelessly deadlocked.

If you're tired during the day as a result, beware of compensating with caffeine. As doctors point out, a regular cup of the coffee that we drink today (and it's usually not a cup if you measure it out, but two or three) has twice as much caffeine as it used to. The same goes for energy drinks or caffeinated soft drinks. They will affect your ability to sleep.

I told him my reasoning was twofold: the Victor Cruz factor makes any story relevant and the fear of the Madden cover jinx was such a threat for Giants fans many of them were actually voting against Cruz.
The four-hour ride back to Cape May was quiet. An overcast day turned sunny in the late afternoon, but at night it was a chilly trip in to port. Some of the men ate, others slept.

It turned out to be the best dessert on all three visits. What we thought would be a simple yogurt drizzled with honey and served with fruit ($11) turned out to be an overwrought mix of items with a stingy mound of tangy yogurt buried at the bottom of the bowl. The baklava ($9) was a deconstructed interpretation with layers of bananas, nuts, phyllo and clove-spiked citrus syrup, accompanied by banana gelato. It was interesting, but I'd rather have the real thing.

One contestant may drop the jaws of old-Hollywood gossip fans. Beverly Aadland was the teenage girlfriend of Errol Flynn, who was then in his 50s. (Flynn would die in Aadland's arms, in 1959.) Aadland's relationship with Flynn was not public knowledge at the time of this appearance, but it was certainly an open secret in Hollywood. (When Marx asks Aadland if she has a boyfriend, one can't help but believe he was being a bit canny.) At Marx's invitation, Aadland sings Elvis Presley's "All Shook Up" as Marx dances around her -- a culture-clash moment.

It does investigate complaints that fall within its jurisdiction, and if those show that a law governing the practice of medicine was broken, the board typically sends the doctor a citation letter, explaining that it intends to take disciplinary action. If the doctor requests a hearing, an assistant attorney general presents the board's allegations and the doctor presents his or her case. Then a hearing examiner -- who is a lawyer -- prepares a summary and analysis of the evidence and sends it to the doctor, who has 10 days to file any objections. The summary and any objections are sent to the board, which then takes action. If no hearing is requested, the board simply reviews the case and takes action.
When the line between reality and virtual reality start to blur, you could be in trouble.

But younger travelers think nothing of it. And that worries him.

Illinois is facing a ticking time bomb. The state's pension systems are only 43 percent funded, leaving an $83 billion pension liability that is crowding out spending on the most basic services, including schools, human services and prisons. This year, the state paid $5.7 billion toward pensions, including debt service, consuming 17 percent of state spending. By 2017, that will reach $7.8 billion, or 21 percent of state spending, according to the Civic Federation.

Cuevas is no awards ingenue; his professional accolades could fill one of the historic Americana hutches in the Pluckemin foyer. But how this particular award came to be is an interesting adventure itself. At Blue Hill, an impressed customer told Cuevas that he planned to nominate him for an award. Cuevas thought little of it. But another night, the customer brought in a group of friends. “Would you mind cooking for us? No restrictions.” Turns out the customer was Sevi Avigdor, U.S. president of the International Academy of Gastronomy, and had brought along the French president of the entire organization.

If you have any to add to the list, please do so in the comments section.)

“The real test regarding Daqduq was not whether the United States should violate our security agreement with Iraq in order to maintain custody of him outside of the country. The real test was whether the United States could exercise our influence effectively with the Iraqi government to ensure that a committed killer of Americans would be held accountable for his crimes in the U.S. system of justice.

Today we celebrate the 42nd anniversary of Earth Day -- an important opportunity to really think about the planet and what we must do to ensure it continues protecting, supporting and sustaining us. From the waters of our splendid Great Lakes to the air we breathe, to the land beneath us and the skies above us, Earth is a treasure that we must not take for granted.

Despite its location, at the bottom end of East Burnside's drinking row, and its concept, an izakaya mixed with a ramen-ya, Mirakutei feels more like a place to enjoy a tipple than get trashed. It's partly the space, a modern box of concrete and steel where large windows let passers-by see your every move. So come for the food.

OK, fine. I acknowledge that many new phones ship with outdated versions of Android, and that many phone carriers don't bother deploying updates to their customers.

Little good it did me, as his fed-up dad apparently reported the car the vile youth (can you tell I'm still a little perturbed years later?) was driving as stolen and therefore his insurance wasn't responsible. I wasn't about to add insult to injury and pay the high deductible on our insurance, so Sweet Sassy still has the bent bumper, much like the wrinkle in a well-seasoned woman's forehead.

To understand the history behind Scandinavian Easter celebrations, we need to travel back in time. When the First Nicean Council in AD 325 established when Easter would be celebrated, Scandinavians were oblivious to the Easter of the southern parts of Europe and the Holy Land. During the Roman Empire and early Middle Ages, they were still very much pagans, believing in Valhalla, Asgard and Norse gods Thor, Odin and Freya. Most seasonal "holidays" were linked to the agricultural year — harvest and sowing — and the Christian Easter was nothing the northerners paid much attention to. It did, after all, take Christianity almost 1,000 years to break into Scandinavia.

I believe what Rock Gaming says, because as you look back at what their principals, mainly Dan Gilbert, have said, since he's made a commitment to Cleveland, he's done what he's said he's going to do. I don't think they came to Cleveland to build a first phase and stop.
His decision comes as states with programs similar to what Maryland is considering have come under fire from federal prosecutors and were forced to suspend all or parts of their programs. His decision could once again kill an effort that has stalled in the General Assembly for years.

Very few foods seamlessly cross cultures, but meatballs are one of them. Around the world, reasons for eating them are similar. They're made from simple, easily available ingredients. They're economical -- dropped into soup, spooned over pasta or potatoes, or wrapped in rice paper, a little meat can stretch into a full meal. They're familiar and, most importantly, they taste good -- which ultimately translates into a food that never goes out of style.

Meanwhile, audiences weren't as nostalgic for the 1990s as Hollywood had hoped. "American Reunion,"the fourth entry in the raunchy "American Pie" teen comedy franchise, opened with a so-so $21.5 million. A 3-D version of James Cameron's historical romance"Titanic" was less popular, bringing in a decent $17.4 million over the weekend. The 3-D version first hit theaters Wednesday, so its five-day total is $25.7 million.
Left fielder Nolan Reimold was out of the lineup Saturday due to reoccurring neck spasms, which cost him a game Thursday as well.
I don't remember a time when so many topics have become politically unmentionable in one party or the other. Republicans cannot admit to any nuance in policy on climate change. Republican members are now expected to take pledges against any tax increases. For two consecutive Presidential nomination cycles, GOP candidates competed with one another to express the most strident anti-immigration view, even at the risk of alienating a huge voting bloc. Similarly, most Democrats are constrained when talking about such issues as entitlement cuts, tort reform, and trade agreements. Our political system is losing its ability to even explore alternatives. If fealty to these pledges continues to expand, legislators may pledge their way into irrelevance. Voters will be electing a slate of inflexible positions rather than a leader.

Absurdly provocative or leeringly voyeuristic, Mel Ramos' modernistic work stimulates the intellect, especially for those whose intellect is located just below the navel. But isn't that the premise behind advertising  and Ramos' parody on sexist advertising  to manipulate via illusory images? The native Sacramento son, who studied with Wayne Thiebaud, has been embraced by feminist critics for his work, such as "Lola Cola #5," showing a well-endowed nude blonde immersed in a soft-drink glass. Pop humor also shines through, as in "Candy #3," in which a peeled Oh Henry bar wrapper reveals a topless Angelina Jolie.

Metta World Peace  the former Ron Artest  found himself in yet another controversy on Sunday, a moment that started amid celebration. He had just dunked for the Lakers over Oklahoma Citys Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka and was pounding his chest with his right arm. With James Harden directly next to him, World Peace raised his left elbow over Hardens shoulder and cleanly hit the Thunder guard in the back of the skull. Harden remained down for about a minute before going to the locker room and did not return to the game. Said World Peace: I got real emotional and excited. He called his actions unfortunate and unintentional.

The potential repercussions of the failed discussions are devastating. Reno-Tahoe's bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics, for instance, is surely doomed because a modern Sacramento complex was being pitched as an ideal venue for figure skating and hockey, among other sports. On Friday, a discouraged Councilman Steve Cohn said a new arena in the railyard would have added density and substantially strengthened the city's chances of obtaining federal grants for the long-anticipated downtown transit center.

His incentive compensation, which was absent the long-term incentive he typically receives, was down 38 percent to $2.7 million.
