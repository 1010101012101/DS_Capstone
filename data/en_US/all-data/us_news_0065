PORTUGAL: Spain has its flamenco music, but fado (which translates as “fate”) is a unique folk style born out of tiny clubs. The acoustic guitar accompaniment supports highly emotional vocal performances sung by divas or their male counterparts. Its unrivaled queen was Amália Rodrigues, but the many modern-day singers are led by Mariza, Ana Moura and Cristina Branco.
Benedict asked about the future of the planet and the environmental risks it faces, and wanted to know what the astronauts' most important message would be for young people when they return home.
Granted these lumbering, decomposing, brain-munchers aren't exactly the cuddliest critters of the bunch, but I do feel very confident arguing that zombies are the most layered and complex monster on the market today. That's right. I'll say it. Zombies are deep, man.
Cunningham was cleared to play just prior to tipoff in the Blazers’ last game, a 109-103 victory over the Chicago Bulls at the Rose Garden, but McMillan elected not to play him. It was the first game the second-year player has missed all season.

Also, since 2007, government spending has jumped $1.1 trillion, but only $200 billion was needed to cover inflation — the $900 billion additional was new programs and benefits and higher pay. That has increased federal spending's share of gross domestic product from 19.6 percent to more than 25 percent.
Nothing stopped Cardinals starting pitcher Chris Carpenter - not some stray cumulo nimbus, not a tedious 27-pitch first inning, not two difficult fly balls driven over right fielder Jon Jay, not the uncertain run support that has tracked him for much of this season.

"We went down so fast that everything — flares, radios, GPS, cell phones — was gone, like vaporized," recalled Gladhill, who has had extensive military winter-survival training. "We held on to the hull for dear life and prayed we would be blown to shore. I kept thinking, 'I can't believe this is happening. We always prepared for every contingency. We even had man-overboard drills.'"

McGregor is fine as the writer, although frankly he projects a bit too much handsome confidence. Then again, part of the hack’s problem is that he thinks he knows exactly what’s going on — just as part of the Brosnan character’s power is that he fervently believes his own lies.

Among the stranger economic tenets of conservatism, which Paul Krugman argues against ("Bombs, bridges and jobs," November 1), is that government can't create jobs. As the theory goes, all government does is displace jobs that would have been created in the private sector if government had just "gotten out of the way and let the free market work." Since the government never has nor can do that, the theory has not been fully tested, thank goodness.

The legislation would allow the postal service to reduce its pension and retiree benefit costs and pave the way for service changes. The bill passed by a vote of 62 to 37 Wednesday, after two days of voting on amendments.
Cap-and-trade systems are designed to cut emissions over time, at a lower price than other potential tools such as a carbon tax. Such systems set limits on greenhouse gas emissions and create markets for companies to trade the right to produce those gases. Companies that cut their emissions below targets set by the state can sell their excess allowances to other companies.
I am talking about the ongoing scientific innovation at our local universities, something most other Midwestern cities do not have. The new entity would receive stock options in any deal funded by the local venture to recoup costs of the program eventually, something any start-up would gladly pay.

Gaga taped the voice-over back in August, at the time admitting it was "a little nerve-wracking." She told EW.com, "I make music, but I don't do voice-overs every day of the week, and their characters are so awesomely convincing and sincere and wild and funny, I had to remind myself constantly of the sincerity of the humor."

As Liz looks back on these years from adulthood, retaining the wary, no-nonsense voice of her teenage self, she is on a quest for a mentor, all the while sublimating that need by being a responsible and concerned older sister and cousin. Mostly, the adult women around Liz just teach her painful lessons about men. Watching these women driven crazy by a man's absence, or turning a blind eye to a man's destructive habits, teenage Liz wonders "if loving someone means you are never happy unless they're around and sometimes not even then."

I was wrong. From the start, "Shortbus" made me glad for the wait -- and of course, glad for the "command" to see it. Mistress Morgana and I agreed that it was the best portrayal and contextualization of hard-core sex -- real sex -- that we'd seen yet in a film. The movie opens with a medley of the main characters having explicit sex, from autofellatio to intercourse in many amazing positions. And in each case it's realistic to a fault, without telling the viewer what to think about the sex they're seeing. Fluids fly, women seek orgasm openly for its own sake and nothing else.

Markets were thrown into a tailspin Monday after weekend elections in France and Greece led to a sharp shift in the political landscape with the focus shifting away from austerity. In France, President Nicolas Sarkozy was thrown out of office by voters opposed to his belt-tightening program and replaced by Socialist Francois Hollande, who wants growth to become a more central plank of Europe's debt crisis resolution.

LYONSDALE, N.Y. — Authorities say a 62-year-old New Jersey man has died of injuries suffered in a kayaking accident in northern New York.
He never cried out for help any more than he asked for it on the football field. He played hurt. He practiced as hard as he played and preached. He never - that's never - took a down off. Those of us who watched his exuberance, his love for the game and the people who played and the people who watched and returned that love, never thought or worried about demons.
In 2009, the city reported 1,008 car crashes, police Lt. Gary Wolske said. That's roughly one crash for every 28 people living in the suburb -- a higher rate than the state. (Ohio's statewide numbers come in at one crash for every 38 people.)

Nalbandian had several run-ins with the chair umpire during the often tense match. The Argentinian was enraged when a tournament official refused to overrule the chair umpire's decision to decline a review of a line call late in the fifth.

The political consequences of austerity are becoming apparent. The Dutch government, one of the EU's main enforcers of fiscal orthodoxy, collapsed this week over disagreements about spending cuts and taxes that will be needed to bring the deficit under 3% of GDP next year.

"In a perfect world, a year seems like a reasonable time for a young, well-educated person to get back on their financial feet, but it depends on their personal financial situation.

The Billikens, like the Badgers, employ multiple half-court sets, rely on a point guard to orchestrate them and, if everything goes according to plan, milk some 30 seconds off the 35-second shot clock.

Over that time, shorter segments have ruptured farther south in Oregon and Northern California, producing magnitude-8 quakes.

That's because Tommy (Chris Kerson) is pulled back into service for a crime lord engaged in a turf war with the drug-dealer brother of Darren (Will Blagrove).

Elsewhere, taxpayers and local agencies bear those costs.

Thing is, the free-agent market this summer just isn't very good. Babby said he is committed to keeping a competitive and entertaining team on the floor even if the Suns decide to save their powder, so to speak, for the summer of 2013.

Here's one example for reducing water use from my own experience. When we wanted hot water, say to take a shower or wash the dishes, we would turn on the faucet and wait – a long time – for the hot water to show up. We installed a water pump, with a timer, that keeps the water circulating at desired times, Turn on the faucet and the hot water arrives in about three seconds. I estimate this saves about 10 gallons of water every day, thus nearly 4,000 gallons a year. Multiply that by just 1,000 houses adding this feature, and the annual water consumption is reduced by 4 million gallons.

A vibrant, open system that incorporates a larger share of the solar energy community would create far more jobs than the 200 to 300 new ones envisioned by Measure B. It would serve not only Los Angeles but the rest of the country and possibly even the entire world, just as L.A.'s movie industry has a global reach. Without a doubt, home and business owners would want to take advantage of the expertise in this open solar community and install their own green power facilities, generating more than the 400 megawatts of clean energy outlined in Measure B.

For skin that's healthy (an attractive color), wealthy (nicely plumped-up) and wise (flexible, with a ready memory), you have to do more than splurge on not-so-magic but oh-so-expensive cosmetics.

Retirement would be based on actual time worked (no more "airtime" purchases), normal base pay (no more adding bonuses, overtime, unused vacation and sick leave) and a three-year average of final compensation (no more final-year spiking).

Will that have to mean new money for the city along with restructuring? Maybe. But the answer is less critical than whether whatever the state does actually works.

Speaking for “that’s not true” was Timaree Schmit, a “feminist academic” who earned a doctorate from Widener University in human sexuality and paid her tuition — you guessed it — as a “burlesque performer and go-go dancer.” She calls Layden “slanderously wrong” and a “shoddy source of information with an anti-porn, sex-negative, slut-shaming agenda.”

Bonds were for the most part a better investment than stocks until the Fed lifted the cap on rates in 1951. That year the tide reversed and stocks outperformed bonds by 25 percentage points, according to Barclays. Aside from recession years, that trend of outperformance by stocks continued over the course of the decade. (It was 1954, incidentally, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average finally regained its pre-1929-crash level.)

Brayan Pena led off the inning with a double. The Royals were up 4-2 and decided to play for a tack-on run. Mitch Maier was at the plate and attempted a sacrifice bunt to move Brayan to third.

I'm calling about Opinion Shaper Jeanie Ransom's column on cell phone use. I thought this article was very ridiculous and in bad taste. To bring up these accidents in the past was a very terrible thing to do. As a matter of fact, the bus accident on Interstate 44, the truck was actually not slowing but was stopped in a construction area when the bus hit it. Also, she said school bus drivers can use cell phones. School bus drivers cannot use cell phones in the district that I drive in. If we get caught using a cell phone, we get fired. If we get a phone call, what we can do is pull over to the side, take the call and then be on about our routes.

Excerpt: This time around, the debate is spurred by the enormous amounts of cash suddenly tossed around by TV networks. And because head coaches rake in millions of dollars each year. And also — let’s not overlook this — because when guys like Terrelle Pryor are trading autographs and game-worn gear for tattoos and cash, we begin to wonder: Maybe it’s a dumb move, a signature for permanent body ink, but why can’t he trade on his name? Why shouldn’t LaMichael James and Darron Thomas and the Rodgers brothers get something for what they give on Saturdays? Haven’t they earned it? Who could possibly be against the idea?

ø"Some key elements that point to excessive optimism are missing," says Grigoli.

As someone who was involved in the divestment movement against apartheid in South Africa, I read with interest the Rev. James W. Dale's recent commentary ("Choosing to stay engaged," May 4).

In fact, his commentary reminded me of the arguments made against divestment of companies involved in South Africa.

So many of these iPad-ish 10-inch tablets are like the women on "Real Housewives." They're all aiming to emulate the same ideal of beauty and have undergone so much work from so many hands towards that single goal that they're mostly indistinguishable from each other. And they're all made mostly from the same inorganic EOM components. I'm looking through my notes and count five that merit little more notice than "10 inch screen, Android 3 OS, Tegra 2 processor, front and rear cameras, HDMI out."

This week, thanks to a suggestion from a reader, we're going to slice and dice on TV dramas. To make it a little tougher, we're limiting it to major network shows, which is far more difficult because all of the truly great dramas -- "Breaking Bad," "Mad Men," "Justified" and several others -- are on cable.

El Palmar is a classic, mainstream Mexican- American restaurant, right down to the neon decorating accents and the sombreros nailed to the walls. The décor is hokey, half-hearted and clichéd, just the way we like it. The menu is all but indistinguishable from thousands of other thriving restaurants like it throughout California. It's that way because the concept, with the nips and tucks for the American palate, is a proven winner.
"We're just really ready to play," James said.

Hey, Paul: One example is Atlanta. The Falcons were 4-12 in 2007 and in disarray after the Michael Vick dogfighting scandal and the desertion of coach Bobby Petrino. After cleaning house, the Falcons went 11-5 in 2008, 9-7 in 2009, 13-3 in 2010 and 10-6 in 2011. They made the playoffs the past two years for the first time in back-to-back seasons.
Gingrich would love to compete in this Southern state, but he's not. Only Romney and Paul landed spots on the ballot, by having early organizations strong enough to collect the required 10,000 signatures. That leaves Virginia mostly a curiosity.

Growing up in the aptly named Millstone, N.J., Chana sat up late at night as a child, ears tuned like an animal's, listening for the thud of her drugged, depressed mother hitting the floor. She would scurry downstairs, extinguish the Tareyton cigarette still in Mom's mouth, haul her up by the armpits, tuck her into bed. "That familiar state," she writes, "hating the one you love, the one you're most connected to."
