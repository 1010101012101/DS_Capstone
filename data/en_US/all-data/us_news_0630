You might think Voinovich, twice burned, has moved on from pursuing high-tech endeavors. Not quite.
First, the basics: Diamond value and quality are determined by "the four C's": color, clarity, cut and carat. The only way for buyers and sellers of secondhand stones to qualify those details — and then agree on a fair price — is for a stone to be certified by the Gemological Institue of America or an equally reputable agency, according to Raz Gnat, who has long run Denver's Gnat Jewelers alongside his father, Itzhak Gnat. "The certificate really protects the consumer," Raz says. Here are some of his other thoughts on dealing with secondhand stones. Elana Ashanti Jefferson
The driver of the Nissan, 28-year-old Ahmed M. Kighta, was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 2:48 a.m., according to the Cook County Medical Examiner's office.

The second concern involves the 2008 beating death of a 10-year-old Fresno boy and pending legislation about sex offenders. If it's hard to see the connection between those incidents and last month's audit of the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services, that, in a way, is the point.

The protest, however, was only part of what appeared to be a widespread effort by Democratic forces to target Romney for defeat. Many polls have shown Romney as the strongest Republican candidate in a head-to-head race against Obama, and a loss in Michigan could threaten Romney's chances of winning the nomination.

It's going to be tough for the Los Angeles Clippers to come up with an encore for their Game 1 performance when they resume their Western Conference quarterfinals set with the stunned Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday.
This self-awareness and sensibility has served Schultz well. A multimillionaire several times over, Schultz returned to the helm of Starbucks in 2008 after the company he introduced to the world two decades earlier became as flat as a three-day-old Latte. The stock price for Starbucks halved as quality decreased, and Schultz decided quickly into his 2.0 stint running the company that all of its processes needed to be rebooted. He cut back on locations, spent tens of millions of dollars on employee retraining, and charged ahead with the risky launch of the VIA instant coffee brand.
"We are not the candidate who reinvents himself from week to week," said David Axelrod, Obama's top campaign strategist, in a swipe at Republican contender Mitt Romney.

On the eve of the start of the free agency period, the team released center Jason Brown, and defensive tackles Justin Bannan and Fred Robbins.
The rebuttal is to look at a photo of a Thome family reunion. They are all big men and women. His father, Chuck Jr., all but tanned the leather covers of pristine white softballs with his bat on the playing fields of Peoria, Ill. His aunt, Carolyn, was such a prospect that the hometown Caterpillar Tractor Co. gave her a mail room job at the age of 15 so she could slug away for their women's team, the Dieselettes.

Benson and his crew even had to design a special ladder to work on them. At every rung there are hooks for the harness, and it’s made to gently attach to the structures, touching at only two points. Every part of the ladder that comes in contact with the Shuttlecocks is padded — Benson and his team repair scratches, they don’t make them.
“I argue that if you really want to have a complete and exciting life, you have to have the courage of dreaming big,” he told students, parents and teachers who packed the auditorium at Barrington High School, his first stop. “One of the great weaknesses of American culture right now is we haven’t had a conversation about the size of the dreams we need.”
I'm looking forward to the day when the Timbers are top of the table and playing for the MLS Championship right there on their home pitch, Jeld Wen Field. I can hardly imagine the intense environment that would be at that stadium. To say it would be huge would be an understatement. It's a bit of a dream right now, but it definately is not out of the question. The organization wants to be top class and they are building up to that with everything I've seen, its just not happening yet out on the pitch.
It may be a pointless exercise to delve into the pros and cons of the Buffett rule, given that the bill has no chance of making it past a Senate filibuster. Besides, as a tax measure originating in the Senate, it violates the constitutional requirement that all such bills start in the House — where the GOP majority has no plans to slap a new minimum tax rate on the wealthy. The fact that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) took the bill (S 2230) straight to the Senate floor, with no hearings or committee action, is a good indication that the point is simply to grandstand.
Notable: The Heat are among the league's hottest teams coming into the postseason, having won 15 of their final 18 games, putting the much-grumbled-about five-game losing streak that preceded that run well behind them. The 76ers, on the other hand, lost five of their final six games as injuries to Iguodala and key reserve guard Lou Williams hurt them.

On Aug. 31, new figures show three out of five O.C. schools fall short of federal No Child Left Behind testing targets in 2011 – the largest number ever. The reason: Scores are climbing steadily on state standardized tests, but not fast enough to keep up with annual increases in federal testing targets.
Parents just don't understand. That's the message of Lee Hirsch's powerful documentary "Bully." The parents of kids who behave thuggishly to their classmates shrug off child-on-child abuse as "kids just being kids." The families of children on the receiving end of nonstop mistreatment don't comprehend their suffering. The parents of 17-year-old Tyler Long, allegedly the victim of longtime harassment by his classmates, didn't realize how he felt until he hanged himself in his bedroom closet.

Though Michigan Opera Theatre's production of Georges Bizet's "The Pearl Fishers" closed last weekend, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra is picking up the Bizet baton. The orchestra will perform Bizet's zesty Symphony No. 1 (1855), an alluring and graceful classically minded work written when the composer was just 17 -- nearly two decades before he wrote "Carmen," the opera that guaranteed his immortality. This week's programs also include miniatures by Jacques Ibert, Benjamin Britten and Mozart, whose Violin Concerto No. 3 will feature DSO acting associate concertmaster Hai-Xin Wu.

The lyrics come right out and tell you everything you need to know about this shoulder-shaking throwback to the days when funk went to the disco. "I don't got no ABBA/I don't play no gabber/I like Zapp, not Zappa/So please quit your jibber jabber." And yet, as retro as they aim to be, there's still something inherently now about the end result.
The percentage of African-Americans pulled over decreased slightly, from 17.9 to 17 percent, but rose slightly for Hispanics (10.9 to 11.4 percent) and Asians (6 to 6.3 percent). Arrests decreased for African-Americans, 34 to 32 percent. By comparison, in the first set of data gathered by federal authorities, African Americans accounted for 40 percent of all arrests from January to April 2000.

Willamette (1-2) rebounded after opening the season with two losses to nationally-ranked Division III opponents, rolling up 419 yards against Southern Oregon.
All you have to do is dig into the roster and depth chart a little bit to see that a return to tackle makes most sense.

Both grew up with NFL-playing fathers, left their home states to attend college, returned for one more college season when the "experts" thought they should have jumped to the NFL and then finished as Heisman runner-ups. Now both have been taken No. 1 overall by the Colts, and strangely, they'll even have the same tutors. Bruce Arians was Manning's first NFL quarterbacks coach and now he's back as Indy's offensive coordinator, and former offensive coordinator Clyde Christensen is now the Colts quarterback coach.
Verizon is introducing the fee as cellphone companies are seeing their profits cut by the cost of subsidizing smartphones, especially iPhones. Smartphones generally cost hundreds of dollars more than they sell for in stores. Wireless carriers count on making the money back through service fees over time, but those fees aren't growing as fast as smartphone sales.
Tebbs' shop in Auburn sells the Felt line of road bikes, among others, and he says the biggest sellers, the Z-series, are more for longer, noncompetitive rides. They cost from $799 to $6,999, with much of the escalating costs tied to lighter weight and a better lineup of components such as cranks, gear shifters, brakes and wheels.

Mendoza bore his trials with the belief that God was making him stronger and teaching him a life lesson, still grateful and proud of his family: three sons, one daughter, two grandsons.

Brandon Roy has a similar surgery before the Blazers' 2010 playoff series against Phoenix and came back eight days later to play in Game 4. Roy's entrance onto the court for warm-ups, then his introduction when he entered game, were moments that anyone who was in the Rose Garden will never forget.

(On if he feels they might be able to get equal value on a quarterback late in the draft)- "Yeah, obviously it's a little less pressure on those types of guys. Do they have to come in and start? No. Do we think they can be starters down the road? Yeah. I think there are guys like that. Mike talks about that all the time, in a perfect world you would always try to draft a quarterback and hopefully you hit on a Matt Hasselbeck or a later, mid-round guy who turns out to be a good player. It doesn't happen very often. Like you said, if you are in whatever round, fourth, fifth, third, if you are close and you have a chance to draft a quarterback, you are probably going to do that if you think he has a chance to be a starter down the road. Now, if you think he is going to be a career backup then in my opinion you don't draft him. You can draft him late to be your third or second or whatever, but if there is a guy who you think can be the starter, why not take a chance on him?"

- A left-wing party opposed to the terms of Greece's bailout agreements will on Tuesday try to form a government after a general election produced a stalemate in parliament.
The frustration's unlikely to end soon. Richmond Heights -- like every other municipality in Ohio -- now faces even more hits: Its aid from the state's Local Government Fund is going down, and so is its share of the commercial activity tax. Losing the estate tax will erase what for years had essentially been the community's capital fund -- just when it needs a new snowplow. And then there's the matter of declining real estate values that are already translating into less property tax money for the city and its stressed schools.
The IRS says that, historically, up to 25 percent of filers wait until the last minute to file their federal returns.

Flash back a couple weeks to Joe Biden's introduction at the Democratic National Convention. Over violins, we hear, : "No matter where he is or no matter what he's doing, if one of the children calls, he stops and takes the call. ... He's a wonderful father, he's an exceptional grandfather, and that's really what it's about for him." When Biden's speech ends, an army of small blond Biden kin rushes the stage. In fanciful moments, I sometimes wonder whether politicians are very different from you and me -- a kind of alien race living symbiotically (or, perhaps, parasitically) among us. It's comforting to hear about their family lives because it reassures us that they are, in fact, genetically human.
At the Grilled Cheese Invitational, Walker found some competitors scoring high by getting extra crafty with their butter. Some mixed sage leaf with melted butter in the pan to add an extra layer of aromatics and depth of flavor. Another trick is to add a little grated Parmesan cheese to the buttered pan before adding bread.
In the 3-4 defense, large is huge. All three guys up front need to go 300-pounds-plus and all three need to be able to run. Redding is set at one end.

Sounds of Colombia: The hype machine at South by Southwest is a powerful, expensive instrument, and on Friday night that engine was running on overdrive: Jack White on 6th Street, Skrillex a few blocks away at the Mohawk, Eminem and 50 Cent at the Shady party, all relentlessly pushing otherwise adventurous souls to feel guilty about resisting. I resisted, instead opting for a different adventure: Grupo Canalon, a traditional Colombian rhythm band centered around the magnetic sound of the marimba, a wooden xylophone that puts forth gentle, melodic tones.
“When you're first diagnosed with cancer, you go into a dark place,” said Reese, as she finished a one-hour exercise class this week at DeKalb Medical Center in Decatur, Ga.
How do other counties manage with fewer employees? Perhaps now is a good time to investigate. GIS is a marvelous tool. But nobody "needs" one to run a government.
Dweebies (Gamewright, $11; 2-6 players; age 8+; 20 min.) This whimsical card game falls into that special category of games that are harder to win than they appear at a glance. The cards feature a variety of cartoon characters (the artwork is independent of the actual game play, but it adds to the charm), and players take turns adding them to the grid. Match two cards at the end of a row or column, and you clean up. Sounds easy, doesn't it?
But the handwriting recognition isn't automatic; instead, you have to tell the program to translate each page of notes one at a time. And the program does an awful job of handwriting recognition. When I wrote in cursive, it recognized about one out of every 10 words.

The next time was under very different circumstances. Later in 1990, I covered the taping of a portion of the video for her “All the Man That I Need” single — the part in which the wall of a room where Houston is singing is raised, revealing a choir — at Newark Symphony Hall. The choir was composed of students from several local schools.

He came under particularly relentless attack from Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the third-place candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party.

"Mitt Romney’s defiance of decades of precedent set by presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle, including his own father, begs the question -- what does he have to hide?" said Obama campaign manager Jim Messina in a statement Friday. "Did he exploit loopholes in the tax code by keeping his investments offshore and is that why he’s protecting those loopholes now? Why did he open a Swiss bank account instead of an American bank account and establish a corporation in Bermuda instead of on our shores? Did he pay a lower income tax rate than the 13.9% he paid in 2010, and is that why he opposes the Buffett Rule to ensure millionaires don’t pay less taxes than middle-class families?"

A little more than a month after the murder, George Machino, a hunter and small-time gun collector, noticed that a handgun was missing from his safe and had been replaced by a toy gun. He confronted his teen-aged son, who admitted that he had taken the gun and "loaned" it to an acquaintance named Eric. Machino and his son went to Eric's apartment. There was no answer. They went to the manager. She said the police had told her that if anybody came by looking for Eric Winfrey, she was to direct them to Det. Michael Harvey of the St. Charles police department. Machino went to the police department and told Harvey, who was leading the investigation into the murder, that his son had "loaned" Winfrey a .38-caliber Taurus Model 80 revolver.

Ryan joined the St. Paul Police Department in 1968 and made all the right career stops: narcotics, vice, robbery, special investigations, station commander. He was even a candidate for police chief in 2004.

To prepare the compound butter: Put shallots, tarragon, star anise, vinegar and Champagne in small saucepan and reduce over high heat until liquid is almost totally absorbed and syrupy. Stir in the lemon zest and juice. Remove the star anise pod. Cool this infusion and then beat it into the softened unsalted butter. Season the butter with plenty of salt and pepper to taste. If you make the butter ahead of time, let it come back to a soft consistency just before roasting.

Intellectuals and journalists regarded Eisenhower as amiable and mediocre. He was neither. He was cold. (See Smith on Eisenhower’s dismissal of his wartime companion Kay Summersby.) He was steely. (A 3-to-4 pack a day smoker, he quit when “I simply gave myself an order.”) He was brutal. (He used financial pressure to bring Britain to heel during the 1956 Suez crisis.) He was subtle. (He assisted de Gaulle’s seizure of power in France in 1944, contrary to FDR’s wishes.) He was audacious. (He evaded Churchill by dealing directly with Stalin.)

But Denktash said Greek Cypriots abrogated any right for a renewed partnership under the island's 1960 constitution when they launched attacks on Turkish Cypriots. Backed by Ankara, Turkey's capital, and the powerful military establishment, Denktash argued for a two-state solution in defiance of international support for a federation.

While U.S. estimates of casualties varied widely, a simple fact tells the scope of the invasion of Japan: The U.S. made 495,000 Purple Heart medals to be given to the wounded and the families of the dead. With the war's end they went into storage for future use. The supply lasted through the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Cold War, the invasions of Grenada and Panama and the first Persian Gulr War, as well as a dozen smaller conflicts. New medals weren't pressed until 1999, when U.S. troops were serving in Kosovo.

His success with co-writing the very different, gangster-themed “Gomorrah” gave Di Gregorio the opportunity to make 2008’s delightful “Mid-August Lunch,” a script he’d unsuccessfully shopped around for 10 years. A small, human-scaled film about the necessity of companionship in general and the bonding nature of shared food and glasses of wine in particular, it was an unexpected success and led directly to “Salt of Life.”

Taxpayers will pay for the bulk of the $12 million project through tax credits, federal stimulus grants and loans. You might not like the idea of using public money for anything other than the most basic government services. But in a world where city leaders can seriously talk about using tax dollars for pro sports and federal leaders go gaga for streetcars, we should all applaud the rare case in which our urban-renewal cash is going to rebuild lives rather than a real-estate developer's portfolio.
The first shot of Emanuele Crialese's remarkable "Golden Door" presents a tantalizing mystery -- two men climbing in barren terrain with stones in their mouths. This is followed by a pullback that loses the men, then finds them again, as with a cosmic eye, on the rocky face of a mountainside. (Agnès Godard did the dazzling cinematography.) The place is Sicily in the time of Europe's tidal emigration to the New World, and the stones in the mouths are traditions of an ancient culture that the men will leave behind. After countless films in which immigration plays a central role -- one of the earliest was Charlie Chaplin's 1917 silent classic "The Immigrant" while one of the best, Jan Troell's "The Emigrants," has never migrated to DVD -- you'd think the canon was essentially complete. Yet this visionary work adds to it by combining harsh realities with magic-realist fantasies.

Perhaps he would agree that what has historically weakened this nation at least as much as any policy the president has ever pursued is the tiresome notion that some of us are more American than the rest of us, that the "all" in "all men are created equal" refers only to those of the right gender, genus, sexual or political orientation or faith. It is an idea abhorrent to the aforementioned sacred ideals, yet one embraced eagerly in recent years by those who apparently feel bereft without someone to fear.

MSU recently outlined its proposal to Detroit development officials. Before the project can proceed, the city and MSU must negotiate a formal agreement, a process that could take nearly a year. MSU has already looked at potential sites on Detroit's east side but won't pick a spot without city approval. The project would probably start small, on 10 acres or less, but eventually grow into a campus, possibly tying in a business incubator devoted to producing food.

Alternatively, the capital could see legislative compromise. The second half of Obama's first term could look much like the second half of President Bill Clinton's first term, when Clinton separated himself from congressional Democrats while moving toward the center in search of compromise with Republicans. While some Democrats scoff at this idea, the triangulation strategy, and insist Republicans will not cooperate, others say the idea is not so far-fetched.

Back then, the stadium probably sat 2,000 people, all on bleachers situated behind and around home plate. They'd been there, in some form or another, since the field opened in 1951. Beyond that, there was no "stadium," per se. It was like a high school field, in as far as the place's purpose was purely to host baseball games.
Such advantages are apparent when considering what letter-grade systems have replaced. In New York City, restaurant-inspection results compiled in a numerical score used to be posted online. Restaurants racked up points for violations—not good practices—so a lower score was better.

According to the Associated Press, the former Fugees singer, who was raised in Brooklyn and New Jersey, would have to prove that he has resided in Haiti for five consecutive years, owns property in the country and has never been a citizen of any country other than Haiti. Jean is a U.S. resident, not a citizen, and given his extensive humanitarian work in Haiti, it’s likely he owns property there, but it might be tricky to prove he has lived there for five years, given his multimillion-dollar home in Saddle River.

When Sally comes out to show Don, Megan and Megan's parents her dress for the Cancer Society party -- at which Don is being honored for his flipping-the-bird public letter to Lucky Strike on the evils of tobacco -- she's ultra-modern in a silvery dress. At the party, though she's served fish, which we earlier heard she hates (and which prompted Megan's save-the-Heinz-account brainstrom), Sally is enjoying sitting with the grown-ups. Roger (John Slattery), split from Jane and still radiating the afterglow of his "life-altering" LSD trip, is charming to Sally, calling her his date. But Roger has also been exchanging flirtatious moments with Marie, and Sally -- unbeknownst to them -- gets a peek at Marie pleasuring Roger in a room away from the party. Her face reveals this is the latest bit of her youthful innocence that is now history.

The film's highlights include the justly famed snowball fight sequence during the opening reels of Napoleon's childhood, which demonstrates early on the future emperor's strategic genius. Gance also wowed audiences of his day and ours by going to extreme lengths with his camera, whether swinging it from a trapeze over a raging revolutionary mob, attaching it to the back of a recoiling cannon, or somehow putting it on galloping horseback. At other times, rapid-fire editing of multiple images per second provides a cinematic corollary to the feverish rhythms of the Little Corporal's always-focused mind, a stunningly modern, even postmodern, technique.

"This plant is full of mana and is prized by Hawaiians," says Zane, who as with kukui first used a design inspired by ti (ki in Hawaiian) for a pareu, in this case back in 1997. His current design, found on aloha shirts and dresses, represents the leaves growing at the base of a waterfall, according to his Web site.

If the president's proposed legislation spent all $447 billion dollars on nothing but rolling back government regulations, simplifying the tax code or even paying Congress to stay out of Washington for the next 18 months, then the jobs bill might have a shot at living up to its name.

Smith told investigators that on the night of the baby's death, he had slipped off the couch where he had been sleeping, but that he appeared to be uninjured and she set him back on the cushion.

But the once-in-a-century Capitol project does not justify neglecting the stuff of typical bonding bills. There are more of those projects in the Senate's $496 million version.

To simulate a cheetah pursuing its prey, the coaster features three separate "launch" sequences, akin to the peel-out start of Disney's Rock 'n' Roller Coaster. You slowly (read: safely, so as not to kill anyone) roll into your first rocket launch from the boarding station. There's a second launch that propels you straight up 102-foot Windcatcher Tower, the ride's eye-popping architectural flourish, which, to be blunt, is all killer build-up but no payoff once you're up high.

The higher the percentage of small clay particles, the more water that soil will hold and the less often you will have to irrigate.

Just take a look at the NFL's own website, which provides a league-sanctioned pre-draft "grade" for every prospect -- presumably for more than simple viewing pleasure. In that rating system, Hughes is tied for the second-lowest rating of any player taken in the first three rounds, with a 48.2 score that the NFL itself qualifies as "A player with solid measurables, intangibles, college achievements, or a developing skill that warrants an opportunity in an NFL camp. In the right situation, he could earn a place on a 53-man roster, but most likely will be a practice squad player or a camp body."

Lou started with $50 at the roulette table; after an hour and two $10 vouchers, he left with $60, then broke even playing blackjack. I went off in search of Juanita's golden slots. Revenge of the lobster: The "Lobstermania" machine clawed up a quick $10; "Wolf Tea" gobbled another $15. "Nefertiti" and "Miss Kitty" were equally unkind, and my cash stash evaporated.

“The main objective was to raise awareness about the fact that racism still exists in the hopes that communities will delve deeper into the subject,” Hernandez said. “The way that we approach that, and this was our goal five years ago, is instead of having an event inside our building where people may or may not come ... I came up with a different technique, which was to give organizations a tool kit and allow them to create their own event for their own constituents to meet their own needs.”
"This is not what they signed up for," King said. "I think the league has to pursue these individuals just to send a message that says we are here to protect our athletes.

Citizens, municipalities and other local jurisdictions should be involved in the planning and design process early and often. People need to be informed and involved to ensure that the local community supports the trail and that it is seen as an asset for residents, business owners and the greater community.

"Democratic Russia has failed to invent a new ideology that most of the society can accept," said Alexander Prokhanov, editor in chief of the nationalist Zavtra newspaper.

According to the National Archives, it "provided for immediate emancipation, compensation to former owners who were loyal to the Union of up to $300 for each freed slave, voluntary colonization of former slaves to locations outside the United States, and payments of up to $100 for each person choosing emigration."

Max and Jenny are heavy-hearted. Business reversals, infertility issues and family discord bode ill for a merry Christmas. They’d nearly forgotten the application they’d made months ago to host a child from the local orphanage for the month of December, and when they are informed that their application has been accepted, Max is reluctant to follow through: It’s just not a good time. When he learns that the child in question is mute, reluctance turns to dread.

The Mistake: When you run a cupcake business on a busy street and you're suddenly forced to move because of maintenance and repair issues, it's easy to take foot traffic for granted.

The Blazers came right back as they used four walks by Wright to pull back within one at 5-4. HB used four walks, four wild pitches and a stolen base to score three runs. Wright walked four that inning, but none in the other four innings she worked.

She also went 2-for-3 at bat with both hits being doubles as she also scored two runs.
"I think it is a byproduct of dementia and cognitive problems," McDougall said.
“I’m pitching more with my fastball now,” Strop said. “I used to be throwing off-speed pitches and trying to be sneaky, but now I know I can challenge people with my sinker and make them hit it. It makes it easier. More ground balls and stuff, less pitches in innings. Like before I would get in an inning and throw a lot of pitches. I’d have two strikeouts, three strikeouts, but have a lot of pitches. It’s a long season, so the less pitches you throw in an inning, it’s better for keeping you not hurt.”
4. Beware of promises to regulate the industry. Casino proponents are trying to assure residents that the state will thoroughly regulate the industry. That shouldn't make you feel safer. It should make you laugh. If the state "regulates" gambling the same way it "regulates" your power bills and insurance rates, consumers will lose — and the so-called regulators will end up getting jobs with the companies they allegedly watchdogged. Again, trust history more than promises.

1937 – The final year where games featured a center jump after each basket.
The sons of Mitt Romney don't have such concerns. Regardless of their patriotism, they each had many options beyond the military, thanks in no small measure to family money. The oldest helps run a private-equity firm. The youngest develops real estate in San Diego. Two other of Romney's sons also work in property development or finance. The fifth is a physician. They often appear en masse at photo opportunities celebrating Dad's latest primary victory. Meanwhile, far from public view, other bands of brothers and sisters — soon to include my son — hunker down in faraway lands, sweating out mortar barrages and hoping not to set off improvised explosive devices.
The school district is in the same kind of predicament Francis Howell and Fort Zumwalt faced when their enrollments mushroomed from residential growth. All those new homes built in the Wentzville area during the last decade or so have brought, and will continue to bring, hundreds of additional students per year into schools that cannot easily accommodate them. And Wentzville city officials hope to entice more development in unfinished subdivisions.

I will be a mayor actively involved in improving our public education system. As a parent, it is on my mind daily. As a candidate for mayor committed to rebuilding our economic base, it is vital; and as someone who believes every child should be afforded a quality education, which is the access point to the American dream, it is a moral imperative.

Broomfield's previous films include "Kurt and Courtney" and "Biggie and Tupac," in which he inserts himself, and he increasingly does so again here. Anyone who has ever tried to get an interview with a famous person has been rebuffed; Broomfield, who knows full well how this game is played, could not seem more mortified that he can't secure a chat with Palin. He seems to take it as a personal affront.

Sometimes, a photograph evokes more than just its moment, stirring up a heritage instead. To look at Tommy Prothro, former UCLA and Ram head coach, on the shoulders of his 1966 Rose Bowl team is to see, in many ways, the history of football in L.A. That this history is bittersweet goes without saying; just compare the smiles of Prothro's Bruins with the image of Jack Youngblood — downcast, covered in mud — trudging the sidelines as the Rams lose a 1977 playoff game. Here too, though, desolation yields to something more transformative: a generation later, back on the field of the Rose Bowl, Brandi Chastain peels her shirt off and, in the process, helps propel another kind of football into the public consciousness, suggesting that the more things change, the more (perhaps) they remain the same.

Signature drink: The house sangria, $3 per glass during happy hour, is refreshing. The flavors are complex and fruity, but without the overwhelming sweetness inherent to the drink. The red wine's flavor comes through strongly, and it has just a hint of effervescence.

Others may arrive more innocently: Hilburn said he got a request last week from a school that wanted to bring five exotic insects into Oregon, including carpenter ants and a termite.

With that in mind, one can view the stars sitting in that ballroom as a collection of collagen-injected piranhas, floating in a

The studies were conducted independently of the companies that sell video and computer games.

Several other countries, including Canada, have already pulled Brazilian Blowout off the market. Some state agencies, meanwhile, including Oregon's OSHA and Connecticut's Department of Public Health, have issued warnings.
But if the design is plagued by doubt about Austria's political history and its place in the world, it is precisely that doubt that gives the building its honesty and forthrightness and therefore its power.
