California Teacher Association President Dean Vogel said changing dates won't help the teachers who are laid off and need time to prepare.

Now, however, the Golden State's fastest-growing entity is government and its biggest product is red tape.

Still, by the time the renowned Red Sox closer, Jonathan Papelbon, took the mound for the ninth inning, and promptly struck out the first two batters, Boston needed only one out to clinch at least a tie with Tampa, and a Yankee extra-inning victory would send them to the playoffs. It seemed inevitable, after all, that they would finally dispatch the Orioles to ponder their 14th straight losing season. Indeed, they were 77-0 this season when leading after eight innings.

One obvious reason is that the party itself has so radically changed. The father, as a moderate leaning to liberal, was a comfortable fit in the mold of Nelson Rockefeller of the time.

On the rare occasion he got the materials to mix cement, he would fill a bucket with cement, stick a pole in it and let it harden. Then he'd flip it over and do it to the other end, creating a homemade dumbbell. That he only had 30 minutes a day for physical activity made it more of a challenge.

Running about an hour, "The New World" will be performed on an outdoor stage erected at Cherokee Street and California Avenue. The intersection will be closed to automobile traffic, so everyone should have a good, uninterrupted view of the show. The actors will be miked, so sound should be good, too.
Secondly, your body may become used to a medication that you've been taking for a long time, such as an antihistamine for allergies. That's not necessarily a bad thing, and it's not the same thing as developing an addiction, which could happen if you take a higher or more frequent dose than is recommended.

"It's the first phase of a line that will ultimately connect downtown to the ocean," Villaraigosa said. "Not in 50 years have we had a line into the Westside."
Our marriage is not harmful to our children. However, the fact that the state denies us the protections that civil marriage offers is actually what is harmful to them. My marriage is not a threat to "traditional marriage." If people are looking for someone to blame for the astounding divorce rate in this country then perhaps they should evaluate their own marriages.

If you don't already own a tablet computer, and want one, then the new iPad will be tough to resist -- if you can afford it. The device, which goes on sale March 16 in the U.S., Canada and 10 other countries, will sell for $499 to $829. If you want to save some money, consider the iPad 2, which Apple will continue making and sell for as low as $399.
The veteran-laden Mavericks showed the young Thunder that their supposed superior athleticism did not mean easy baskets. As the Fort Worth Star-Telegram's Dwain Price wrote, the Mavs taught the kids a lesson.
Bal Harbour is happy to have day visitors such as the Shalits - the village will even pick them up in a trolley that goes as far south as Lincoln Road. But tourism officials also want to see people stay there, so they have created children's programs, free beach yoga, and an arts and culture series.

That prospect loomed larger late Saturday when an all-GOP tax conference committee released the tax bill it intends to send to Dayton. The bill is an improvement over its House and Senate antecedents (see box, right). It no longer cuts property tax refunds to low-income renters in order to pay for business tax cuts and no longer raids state reserve funds in the coming year.

Isaac enjoys being with the other kids, participating in the afternoon activities and especially likes the Friday fun events, she said. He enjoys it so much, in fact, Washington was surprised when Isaac chose Summer Advantage classes this year over swimming. She gave him the option to attend a Boys and Girls Club camp instead, but he chose school.
“Playing would give him a great platform. That’s one of the things I did talk about with him,” Dungy said. “I can go some place to a community center and talk to kids and they think of me as a coach, but when somebody like Plax or Michael talks to them, they see a peer. And for him to say something as an NFL player, it’s going to carry a lot of weight. So I’m hoping the Lord does give him that opportunity to play again because I think it will increase his platform.”
Kennedy Space Center Visitors Complex: For the cost of regular admission ($45 plus tax for adults and $35 for children 3-11.), you can get access to the Apollo/Saturn V Center, from which there is a direct view of the launch pad. It's about 6 miles, so the sound and sensation will be worth the price. Getting on the bus from the Visitor's Complex to the Center is on a first-come, first-serve basis. You can also view the launch from the main Visitor Complex, but that's not nearly as satisfying as the other options. Go to kennedyspacecenter.com for details.

Ed Gilroy - Patricia Hanley
The best thing for the country would be to pair a vote to increase the debt limit with the kind of major deficit reduction plan the president is championing. Despite his rhetoric and abandonment of negotiations with the president on Friday, Mr. Boehner appears to recognize that and understand the magnitude of the opportunity he is being presented to do something important. But given that a significant portion of his caucus won't vote to raise the debt ceiling or revenues under any circumstances, he has proved to be a less than ideal negotiating partner.
Coach Nate McMillan will start the same lineup he’s featured throughout training camp: Raymond Felton, Wesley Matthews, Nicolas Batum, Gerald Wallace and Marcus Camby.
The Miller-Kidd matchup is one of the more intriguing subplots of the series. They are two accomplished point guards and both are in the twilight of their careers. Miller is seeking his first playoff series victory and both are seeking their first NBA championship.

About the Pacers: Indiana has beaten Toronto and Cleveland since interim coach Frank Vogel took over Sunday for the fired Jim O'Brien. The Pacers are looking for their first three-game win streak of the season ... Vogel said his first imprint on the team will be using McRoberts and Tyler Hansbrough at power forward and letting point guards Collison and A.J. Price have more freedom to push the tempo. "I've been waiting to hear that,'' Collison told the Indianapolis Star. On Wednesday in Cleveland, Collison had 22 points and nine assists with three turnovers ... Vogel, 37, is the youngest head coach in the NBA.

Using your fingers, gently separate the skin from the flesh along the breast and legs. Carefully spread a quarter of the salted butter mixture under the skin and along the meat of each bird, making sure that the mixture is evenly distributed. Next, gently slide two sage leaves under the breast skin, one leaf on each side of the breast. Take care when you're working underneath the skin not to tear it - the skin will help keep the bird moist while cooking.

As poorly as Edsall has handled all phases of the job – and admitted to a point in an interview with the Washington Post last week – Anderson should do the same in a more public way than a letter of apology to Maryland fans that was taken off the school's website after there were too many negative responses. His “top to bottom” review of the football program should go further, to his own office as well.

People can register with the party when they arrive, and all those who will be 18 by the general election can participate. But the commitment to attend in person - there is no absentee or early voting - means the caucuses draw a relatively small slice of Iowa's roughly 3 million residents. Only about 17 percent of eligible voters took part in the record-setting turnout year of 2008.

“I’ve been really lucky the last few years and thankfully everything has ended up the way it has,” said Godett. “I didn’t even make the first cut at WAER radio as a freshman, and that was devastating at that time. But by the time I graduated I was able to call a lacrosse national championship game, and an NCAA men’s basketball tournament game. It’s a stepping stone every stop along the way. Right now I’m very happy with where my career has taken me, and look forward to more adventures down the road.”

In 2004, 22-year-old Louise Krug graduated from the University of Kansas and moved to California. She was tall and blond, pretty and in love. She had California things to do.
This is not some lame metaphor. This involved actual flames. If it rained the night before a game, a volunteer assistant coach would get to the field early with a gasoline can. He would pour some onto the biggest puddles, light the wet spots on fire and boil away most of the water. Then the team’s freshmen would squeegee the rest of the still-smoking turf.
"Aviation is already taxed at a higher rate than alcohol, beer, cigarettes and firearms - products taxed at high rates to discourage use," says Steve Lott, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, an industry trade group. "In short, the administration is proposing a huge new tax on the least profitable and most highly taxed industry in the economy, while all its competitors are left untouched."
The speech was scheduled for noon at 700 Beta Banquet and Conference Center in Mayfield. The summit is presented by Cleveland Business Connects magazine, Ursuline College, and University Hospitals Ahuja Medical Center.
The concert’s low point was an acoustic interlude featuring covers of popular songs, including a bizarre version of Jay-Z and UGK’s "Big Pimpin’," a clumsy reanimation of Willow Smith’s kiddy-pop "Whip My Hair" and a rather mean-spirited take on Rebecca Black’s universally condemned "Friday" (unless Perry was sincere when she said "Friday" was her favorite song of the year, which seems weirdly possible). These covers were presented, like so much of the show, with a nudge and a wink, as if we were all supposed to be in on a joke about contemporary culture, or pop music, or perhaps Perry herself. Perry, for all her success, is still a bundle of potential energy, and she does leave the impression that she’s smarter than her material and more than aware of her shortcomings. The fear is that she’s shrewd enough to recognize her problems, but not skilled enough to do anything about them.
YOU'LL PAY FOR THAT POOL
Obama issued his threat an hour after leaders of Congress' deficit-reduction supercommittee announced that they had failed to reach agreement on cutting the debt.

Waiting too long can be counterproductive. Research shows that how well you function going into surgery dictates how you'll function afterward. That's because the grinding, bone-on-bone pain of advanced osteoarthritis (the most common cause of disability in the U.S.) leaves you with seriously wimpy muscle tone, which makes recovery slower and harder.

In two weeks, TriMet planners will hold open houses to show the public details of how the Portland-Milwaukie line could look as it squeezes through established neighborhoods. Beginning in 2015, the as-of-yet-colorless line will carry riders between downtown Portland and Milwaukie, traveling across the Willamette River on a new bridge, past Ladd's Addition and Sellwood -- transforming those neighborhoods and points in between.

Carlisle proposed that White Star equip its ships with 48 lifeboats—in retrospect, more than enough to save all passengers and crew. Yet after a few minutes discussion, Ismay and other senior managers rejected the proposal. The Titanic historian Daniel Allen Butler (author of "Unsinkable") says Carlisle's idea was rejected "on the grounds of expense."

The Angelou study compared the corridor with health-tech clusters elsewhere and found a competitive real estate and tax climate here.
Streshinsky came to Kansas City several months ago and, as he described it, spent about four days in a room with Holmquist, Brumley and others, going through the score and text note by note and word by word as they laboriously transformed "The Marriage of Figaro" into a modern-day backstage comedy, in which all the upper-class and lower-class characters in the original were transposed into present-day counterparts without grossly distorting the material.
Before Arizona became a state in 1912, the Phoenix area was largely an agricultural area with a major problem: The rain seemed to come all at once or not at all, giving farmers droughts or floods. The completion of Roosevelt Dam in 1911 controlled flooding and gave farmers and municipalities a more reliable source of water, as well as source of power, enabling growth to swell. Other water systems would follow.
Stacy Martin, a spokeswoman for the museum, said the idea to "buy" one of Caine's arcade games began as a joking conversation between Mallick and Karen Wilkinson, one of the directors of the Tinkering Studio that operates inside the museum.

Is there a panic button?
There is one way to take advantage of the federal government's lack of recognition of same-sex marriage: Such couples can set up a "grantor-retained income trust," a type of trust that family members aren't allowed to create for one another. You put an asset into a trust and retain the right to income from it. You have to pay gift tax on that asset, but the Internal Revenue Service would subtract a standard rate of return from the asset's value, and you would owe tax on that discounted amount—whether the asset produces income or not, says Mr. Olivieri, in New York.

On the way to those ironies, though, we're asked to indulge long stretches of generic situations and dialogue. ("What are we doing?" Lucinda asks. "I've never done this before.") The clichés could have been intended as irony too, but Clive Owen's performance is awfully earnest, and the obviously gifted Swedish director, in his English-language feature debut, hasn't found a tone to lift the film from literal to entertaining. Vincent Cassel's performance is extravagant, but also intrusive -- I never believed the complexities of his character for a moment. The action also comes to a sudden halt every time the Wu-Tang producer-turned-actor RZA steps into a scene as Winston, a worldly wise clerk at Charles's TV agency. The character's prominence is justified, but the actor's preening is unseemly.
One paradox is the deceased is irrevocably out-of-reach to those whose lives he remade. Another lay in Wickersham's simultaneous response of "it's not possible" and "of course" when she heard the news. The author has a gift for both philosophical complexity and the telling detail: Police reaction to learning her mother's first call for help went to a male friend; an aggrieved uncle who trolls assembled kin questioning them to cement his notion that he was notified last.

Oh wait -- he didn't. But you wouldn't know that from the news release put out Tuesday by Rep.

Jamie Durie, author and host of HGTV's The Outdoor Room, suggests three ways to use solar lighting:
Summary: Shoddy defense helped lead to San Diego's failure to reach the playoffs last year, so the addition of three players that could wind up as starters ranks as a fine haul for a team that doesn't usually have much trouble scoring points. All of the other picks stand a good chance of making the roster and contributing in some form, which leads to a top grade.
Karen Klaman, a 64-year-old retired teacher, was clear about why she chose Romney. "I think he's the best one to beat Obama," she said.

It just might kill me. But seriously, folks, I've long maintained that the Big Ten was a far better basketball conference than a football conference because the better athletes in the Midwest generally gravitated toward basketball than football. I thought the conference would get a minimum of four teams into the Sweet 16. If not for the physicality of the Big Ten, it's unlikely that the Spartans could have adapted to the Billikens' overt willingness to turn Sunday's game into a slugfest. Perhaps the Big Ten should just consider itself a basketball league.
On Saturday night, my last night in town, the Shelborne Hotel on Collins Avenue was a perfect snapshot of all the insanity. The hotel was not hosting the most exclusive party that night — the Delano Hotel had the pop-up club Le Baron and a Brazilian-themed, poolside party for the solemnly serious art-mag Visionaire. But the Shelborne was easier to sneak into, which meant that the only celebrities there were those in life-size portraits on the walls of the hotel's mausoleum-like lobby. Not to be deterred by celebrities' absence, attendees instead posed with the pictures, snapping up photographs of photographs.

The modern spin

"The openly closeted Mormon." Here's the really cool part: When I started, the role wasn't even there. I was in the ensemble. All of a sudden they wrote this song, "Turn It Off," and they asked me to sing it. And then this character started evolving and popping up here and there.

Story behind the tattoo: "I won the Golden Gloves in Youngstown in 1986. I was runner-up in 1992. I used to spar with Ray "Boom Boom" Mancini. The last time I sparred was with Kelly Pavlik.

They also represent my interpretation of the world around me."

And so, on this Thursday afternoon in her living room, Didion continues to work it through. "Let me try again to talk to you directly," she writes in "Blue Nights," speaking to her readers as if the book were a kind of intimacy. And: "I tell you this story just to prove that I can." There it is, that push to tell, to observe, and then the deepening: "That my frailty has not yet reached a point at which I can no longer tell a true story." Here again, Didion is triangulating, positioning herself, commenting on the inability of narrative to sustain us even as she invokes it just the same. Or, as she puts it, surrounded by all her familiar photographs: "I didn't think I'd get through this book. But I did. You always do."

This is a delicious, fuller-bodied Sauvignon with only 12.5 percent alcohol. The wine is bursting with character. It's complex, herbaceous and grassy, but it's not overly pungent like some Sauvignon Blancs from New Zealand. The Saint-Bris is just right. It calls out for seafood with an herbal sauce, something like Oysters Rockefeller.
"I must admit I'm skeptical because the basics of human learning haven't changed at all. The fundamentals are time on task, good structure, good instruction - those types of things have always worked when they are done well," Reeves said.

But those teachers have to be prepared to work with this."

During one of those hikes you might tell your kids about that job of yours and how sometimes you don't like it but often you do, just like sometimes they hate school but often they actually have fun there. Tell them in words they can understand what exactly your work entails, and what you had to learn to be able to do it -- and branch off to a discussion of the kind of work they might want to do some day. We want them, after all, to appreciate the world of work, and look forward to it.

"May have seen" is a necessary qualification because the places are hidden, not only by distortions on the map in Niccolo the Younger's book, but also by other names. Frislanda, Di Robilant suggests, is a distortion of Faroe Islands, a contraction and Italianizing of "the old Viking name from Faeroeisland to Frislanda."
"Push the tiller in the direction you want the stern to go" was her single most important bit of advice. It's somewhat counterintuitive for those of us used to steering a car (or even a boat) with a wheel. This simple mantra stood us in good stead whenever we found ourselves in a tight spot.

Then there is Spielberg in May 1978, when AFI caught him really on the cusp — just a year past "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and before "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "E.T." and the rest of the substantial body of work that would come later. "This is a pressure cooker for a filmmaker, to be in front of the next generations, because I guess that's what some of you are going to become," Spielberg said.

The Marriott's introductory rates, however, aren't as intimidating. Booking anonymously for a mid-March stay, we paid $170 for a standard room. (By mid-April, the low-end prices had crept up to $199.) And with a convention-center hotel like this, you always have to figure in some extra nickels and dimes. For Wi-Fi, $12.95 a night. For overnight parking, $38.
The story regarding the teachers union opposing millions in savings of health insurance costs to teachers and taxpayers, and simply not even trying to keep expenses down, is another example of why our systems are broke. The unions, like lobbyists in Washington, seek only to feather their own nests and do not look out for the educators or taxpayers. In fact, I cannot understand why teachers even want to join unions and pay money into these self-serving institutions. The answer is because the unions also run the legislature in Sacramento, and we are stuck with poorly-mandated laws. Even in Washington, the lobbyists tell our elected Congressmen how to vote, so who we elect to office is often a sham.

Brendan leads us into thinking about the perceived value of the gifts we make. Was Abraham willingness to sacrifice his son to God an indication that there was nothing he would withhold?

Barrel 27 — founded in 2002, when From and Myers were both of that tender age — blew out of the gate with bold, full-flavored wines drawn from a variety of Central Coast fruit sources, from Paso Robles to Santa Barbara. They gave the wines fetching proprietary names such as "Right Hand Man" for their Central Coast Syrah (the high-end Syrah is called "Head Honcho") and "High on the Hog," a white Rhône blend. "We tend to be a little more fruit forward," Myers says, "so we feel we're giving out a little more power than you usually see at the price point." Plenty of bang in the $15 range.

Administration officials and lawmakers have complained loudly about federally assisted banks not making enough loans. It's just a matter of time before they start trying to influence the kinds of loans those banks make.

Again, the solution is to bring private capital back into the banks, not public funds, and all the administration's rescue efforts should be trained on that target.

Five companies accepted his résumé, and one invited him for an interview, but still no job.
"They are so used to running that they know how to protect themselves a little bit more," Herman said. "When you're in space, that's not when guys get hurt. Guys get hurt in the pocket when they don't see guys coming and guys fall on their legs.
Heath's half brother told investigators that John used to hit him when he was younger.
Their guaranteed annual return is the assumed earnings rate of the pension funds investments -- a long-term rate projected by PERS every two years. It's been 8 percent since 1989.

The bottlenose dolphin lost her flukes when caught in a crab trap off the coast of Florida. Against the odds, she survived and eventually was fitted with a prosthetic tail.
The lack of care started at the front door and ended when we tried to call to verify restaurant information. The glass door had been tagged with white paint and was smudged. No one bothered to clean it off. Then the wrinkled and spotted one-page menu arrived - it should have been retired a while ago. The interior also needed a good cleaning, and the rickety chairs need attention. Our waiter couldn't remember who had ordered what, and had to ask at every course.
Last year, the number of miners killed on the job in the U.S. fell for a second straight year to 34, the fewest since officials began keeping records nearly a century ago. That was down from the previous low of 52 in 2008.

Ten years into the war in Afghanistan, and after nearly nine years of war in Iraq, we know that the defining injuries of these conflicts for our service members include traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. We also understand that the all-volunteer force is stretched thin and that multiple deployments to combat zones are routine.
Injuries have not kept them from getting after teams. Phillips' 3-4 and an infusion of new players have produced a defensive swagger the Texans have never had.
With the pressure now rising on both sides of the Atlantic, banks can no longer hide behind this collective inertia to avoid tough decisions. Investors may succeed where politicians, regulators and the press have failed in forcing banks to change their business models. Bank chiefs that fail to control costs or cut underperforming businesses will find their own jobs on the line. That could mean tough years ahead for individual bankers, some of whom might struggle to fund their lifestyles they have created. But a bit of hardship might go some way to satisfy the public clamor for retribution, while simpler, scaled-back business models might limit conflicts of interest and reduce the risk of future mis-selling scandals. Above all, a global squeeze on banker pay that boosts returns on equity should bring forward the industry's return to health. Capitalism will be seen to be working—and public confidence in the industry could return. The time for complacency is over.

On conventions: Since the 1990s, state and local governments desperate for stimulus have spent tens of billions on convention space with little to show for it. States and cities were spending $2.4 billion a year, even as “the overall convention marketplace is declining,” Brookings Institution expert Heywood Sanders noted in 2005. A decade ago, 126 million people went to conventions; last year, it was 86 million.

Without closing at least one or two of Opel's 14 plants -- Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas suggested shuttering half -- the automaker has little hope for long-term profits in Europe, Jonas said. Closing even a few plants "in a non-politically embarrassing way" could take years, he said.
"It's definitely unconventional to do this - but anyone who knows Gavin knows the conventional isn't for him," said Peter Ragone, a longtime Newsom adviser. "He wants to try new things and he's not afraid of the outcome, which I think a lot of politicians are. They're afraid to say the wrong thing, and he's willing to try something that no one else has tried. Why not? Life is short."
For the first time this season, Johan Santana (0-2, 3.00 ERA) will make a start on four days’ rest. A series of off-days allowed the Mets to protect Santana and his surgically-repaired left shoulder during the first month of the year. But now he’ll have to work on a regular schedule.

Both research groups tinkered with creations called DNA walkers—mobile DNA molecules, about 100,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair, that have three or more legs made of a string of genetic enzymes. Each leg moves forward based on its chemical attraction to sequences of biochemicals laid down, like stepping stones, in front of it.

The smirking Franco was an odder choice as co-host, and seemed even odder when the show pointlessly put him in Marilyn Monroe drag, but at least it led to a slightly snarky Charlie Sheen joke.

The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a case between the state of Montana and two corporations suing for their “human right” to the “free speech” of election spending. The Supreme Court could take this opportunity to undo its disastrous Citizens United decision. Or it could decline to take up the case by agreeing with the Montana Supreme Court that Montana’s law does not violate the First Amendment. Alternatively, the court could strip Montana of its rights on behalf of corporations, thereby stripping the other 49 states of the right to limit corporate election spending.
Lawmakers said the state’s already-existing anti-bullying laws, passed in 2002, 2005 and 2007, did some good but fell short.

Scores of books, films and plays have narrated and analyzed the terrorist attacks, the causes, and the emotional, cultural and political effects. The responses have evolved from the quiet grief of Anne Nelson's play "The Guys" to such international thrillers as the film "Babel" to Joseph O'Neill's reflective novel "Netherland." But no fictional character or invented story has forced itself into our minds like the events themselves. No movie has matched the power, and the horror, of the snufflike footage of the plane hitting the World Trade Center's south tower, or the iconic Associated Press photograph of a man falling from one of the skyscrapers.
Spencer was phased out by the 49ers' defense last season in favor of free agent Carlos Rogers and rookie Chris Culliver. The eight-year veteran played in just nine games with the 49ers in 2011.

It looks miserable, and evidently it was. Stars Liam Neeson and Frank Grillo spoke recently about making the film for director Joe Carnahan, in which society's rejects must band together after a plane crash to try to protect themselves from a pack of wolves.

A: It's challenging because the teen hormones can really cause erratic and a little bit of regressive behavior. You feel like you've moved past a lot of things like stimming (self-stimulatory behavior like flapping, rocking or spinning) or some of the things that he's been doing as a child that you feel like you've grown out of, you're seeing that again. Also, just dealing with girls and social circles and all these things that are already a nightmare for any typical teenager or typical teenager's parents. But when you fold in autism, you have social issues that are really difficult to navigate. I try to have those conversations publicly as often as possible because, you know, we don't talk about it enough.
As you probably recall, the Seattle Mariners, the team that lost A-Rod (after losing Randy Johnson and Ken Griffey) went out and won a major-league-record 116 games in 2001.

Bucky Brooks, NFL.com: "In reconnecting with Cutler, Marshall will certainly become a difference maker in the NFC based on their previous experience together. Marshall surpassed the 100-catch mark in each of their final two seasons as a tandem, including a career-best 104 receptions in 2007. In addition, he amassed 1,200-plus receiving yards in each season and tallied 13 touchdowns during that span. The addition of Marshall to the lineup provides Cutler with an established No. 1 receiver where the Bears have attempted to use a patchwork assortment to fill that role in recent years."
