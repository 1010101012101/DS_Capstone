but the rest?
As near as I can figure, something about it felt sad. In fact, there have been parts of this year that felt pretty dang sad, and for no good reason. And somehow knitting and spinning made that more visible, more apparent.
Elegant in its simplicity and framed within heavy solder of rusted iron hues, a cross of crystal chandelier remnants crowns a vintage, unearthed vessel. Donned in a slightly iridescent, ethereal patina naturally formed over the decades underground, the earthy bottle both compliments and contrasts the opulent beauty of the fiery Austrian crystal.
California, where I lived for more than 10 years, is an American tragedy writ large.
This shift is natural. To begin with it may seem that we have to make efforts to understand this but after a while the truth of our experience, the obviousness of it, begins to impress itself upon us effortlessly.
I have to mention that one of the best performances was that of ‘Bad Apple‘. There’s this arrangement with only traditional instruments which was then covered with a arrangement of traditional Japanese language. This added with a kinda dance in a kimono (by a real life Alto – guy who plays the role of a woman in kabuki). You can’t beat it!

"the discovery of truth is prevented most effectively, not by the false appearance things present and which mislead into error, not directly by weakness of the reasoning powers, but by preconceived opinion, by prejudice opinion, by prejudice, which as a pseudo a priori stands in the path of truth and is then like a contrary wind driving a ship away from land, so that sail and rudder labour in vain."

I was, then, quite surprised when I read this short story collection. My expectations, admittedly, were rather low and therefore, surely, I would be impressed. And I was. I read this book in one sitting, and could not put it down. The words not only roll, but jump and somersault off the page; Guadalajara was a delight to read from start to finish, and I could only wish for more. There, though, is where the brilliance of Monzó lies. He manages to fit 14 simple but fantastically written stories into such a short page count, yet you never feel short-changed or cheated out of description or character.
I came back to it today, and I have made progress. How much progress? Well, let’s see: I made an introduction page for the overall theme which is “The Last Word Spoken” (I changed my theme from “The Science of Story” to this one) and I have in mind an “about the artist” page for the last two pages of the sketchbook, so that killed 4 pages that I dont have to worry about anymore *sigh*. On the down side, I have 2 drawings I have finished sketching but Im not too pleased with, so I keep putting off adding color. *hangs head in shame*. Life is difficult!

museum to the new museum. Just eight blocks north & right downtown on St Petersburg’s waterfront, the new $36 million building designed by architect Yann Weymouth, is stunning. It is designed to withstand a Category 5 hurricane ( not that one has ever hit Tampa Bay, but just in case) and the world-class collection of artwork is displayed on the 3rd floor above any possible flood waters. The new Dalí’s galleries have 18-inch thick concrete walls embedded with 220 miles of reinforcing steel that have been tested for major storms. The gallery space in the new museum is about twice the size of the previous galleries,occupying about 16,000 sq ft of the 66,450 sq ft. All of the Dali collection, given to St Petersburg by A. Reynolds and Eleanor Morse, can now be displayed permanently. The last 2 painting were signed over to the museum by Brad Morse, their son during the festivities and before the ribbon was cut.

Well, Tuesday was HOT! I have had to turn my fan on and use it to cool Fiona, Lewis, and Clark because they don't like the hot weather. My fish tank heaters have, needless to say, not been on at ALL lately. Gex has been more active and has been out of hiding more lately too. Smokey and Sunny have been just lounging around and drinking LOTS of water (GREAT for them because cats tend to be slightly dehydrated). I have fixed Fiona's wet cage problem. Her cage was getting wet and dirty really fast and I was tired of changing her bedding ALL the time (I usually do it once a week) so I tried to find out what was wrong and discovered that her water bottle was being pushed up against the gerbil cage and it was being squeezed so it leaked. I moved the water bottle and the cage is not dirty as fast now. I plan to add more fish to my tanks pretty soon and will post pictures as soon as I do. It was very pretty (from inside the house) today with blue sky but if you went outside, it was HOT!
As always, I ran out of room to post all of the pictures, so if you'd like to see additional views and detail shots, check out this project's flickr set!﻿
Preheat your waffle iron. Coat it lightly with nonstick spray or melted butter before each round of waffle cooking. (The original WIG recipe says not to do this, but I find my waffle iron works better if I do. Also, for this recipe, if the bananas poke through the batter, they tend to stick.) Ladle a thin layer of batter into the waffle iron. Arrange banana slices in a single layer on top of the batter. Don’t worry too much about how you arrange them–they are going to melt down anyway. I used half a banana for each waffle. Top the bananas with another thin layer of batter, creating a banana sandwich. I used about 1/4 cup of batter for each layer. Cook until crisp and golden. Serve hot, with maple syrup and any leftover banana slices.
This person is someone who pushes my buttons. Not just a few; all of them. Including the big fat red one that says “do not press under any circumstances”. Pushing the red button is my trigger into panic, anger and despair. It is the doorway to all my past pain and trauma. It is what I fear the very most, and I know anyone getting near it will trigger my emotions to spiral out of control. I do whatever it takes in life to prevent anyone from getting even close to this button. But this colleague somehow manages to slip and slide her way around all my control mechanisms and with a sly, gleeful grin on her face, jumps up and down on my past pain anguish and trauma.
In Survival, the author warns that overconfidence nurtured in the low-risk milieu of home and culture can get us into unforgiving trouble in nature. With dire results, climbers often over-weigh the challenges and goals of ascent while treating descent as an afterthought. Experienced hikers get disoriented in the woods when poor visibility, adverse weather, and other natural forces scramble their mental maps. Skiers who venture just off the path at ski resorts may encounter frictionless slopes and unstable geology. And unwary swimmers at some of Hawaii's beautiful beaches are just a rip tide away from their final aquatic adventure.
This was particularly the case in small towns in the Midwest that lacked rail service. Civic leaders lobbied hard to attract steam or electric railways to their community. Twilight Rails notes that the success of these late-building railroads was mixed. Some enjoyed a degree of success, but others were financial failures even before the coming of dependable highway transportation made them obsolete.

Yes, this very much. I become very impatient with this kind of writing by outsiders, and one particular book begins on this very note: at a fruit-seller’s stall! The description is of course of reeking durians. As well, white western writers are rarely charged with inauthenticity: outside of a charge from peculiar national-supremacist groups, no one’s likely to say a book is not “American enough” or “British enough” (unless perhaps it’s an American writing about the UK). There’s no obligation pressed upon a white westerner to pander, no expectation that what they write will be representative of so-and-so. There is no “single story” for them, as Chimamanda Adichie pointed out. They are under no pressure to sell their culture, and if they write something negative about say the white middle-class American life (or, indeed, a white American serial killer) it won’t be used against them or against their culture: nobody will say “Oh, what a shame it is that all young US men are serial killers!” to again paraphrase Adichie. They don’t have to think of what they write, or even how they conduct themselves, will shape outsiders’ view of all white westerners.

A quarter century after the Vaccine Injury Act was passed, nothing has been done yet to conduct the kind of vaccine science that will give us answers about which children are at higher risk than others for dying or being brain injured by vaccination so their lives can be spared. 15 16 17 Whether industry or government will ever do that good vaccine science 18 is an outstanding question. But that does not mean that we, the people, cannot raise the money to do it. That is why the National Vaccine Information Center is creating an independent vaccine safety research program to study long term health outcomes of those who do and do not get vaccinated. 19

I immediately contact my Sgt and tell him what happen. He starts laughing and tells me good job. At the end of the shift he is going through my tickets and he gets to this one. He is laughing out loud. I tell the story to a few officers and pass around the citation. We all get a good laugh at this. My Sgt looks at me and say jokingly “you know were both going to be in L-T’s office tomorrow. I say yeap with a smile.

Workers in manufacturing earn nearly 20% more in weekly earnings than those in non-manufacturing jobs. While a straight comparison of earnings may not be able to show the difference in earnings for a specific worker, Brookings researchers used regression analysis to identify specific job characteristics to provide a more meaningful comparison. When this analysis was done, manufacturing workers realized wages that were 8.4 % higher than those of non-manufacturing workers. In fact, workers at all levels, regardless of race, gender, and education earned more in manufacturing than in other industries with one exception (Hispanics earned 10 cents less in manufacturing than in non-manufacturing). In addition, to higher wages, manufacturing industries are more likely to provide employee benefits like retirement plans, health insurance, paid holiday and vacation.

It wasn’t uncommon to find 300 or more spent cartridge cases scattered all over the place on one single shooting incident. I had serious doubts whether South Africa’s first democratic elections scheduled for 26 to 29 April 1994 were going to be a peaceful event. The ANC and Zulu Inkatha supporters were doing their very best to wipe each other off the map using AK-47 rifles as the chief weapon of mass destruction. According to my observations, it seemed as if the Zulu Inkatha supporters were losing the bloody conflict!

The devil is in the detail here, and because of the confidentiality agreements that Elsevier insists on, it is very hard to find out the detail. So let me start by asking an obvious question: if the pricing policy is so reasonable, then why keep it confidential? Is it not healthy for academics to know how much their libraries are spending for their benefit, and what they are getting for the money, and what other deals would have been possible?
It was well-marked. I did see large signs declaring wines from Italy, South Africa, Chile, New Zealand (where I did see a marvelous array of wines with shelf talkers and swell prices), California, New York, France, Spain, Portugal; dessert wines, sparkling wines, jug wines, and fighting varietals; wines in coolers, wines in cases, wines to be sampled. Wines on sale: every non-sale bottle of wine was 20% off on Tuesdays! Amazing.

If you want to be a star at Thanksgiving, offer to make this green bean casserole with fresh ingredients. I've made one casserole after another for several years and am happy to share all the tips and tricks and techniques that make this a sure-fire success.

“What majestic trees! What powerful rivers! What beautiful animals!”, he said to himself. As he was walking along the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. When he turned to see what the cause was, he saw a 7-foot grizzly bear charging right towards him. He ran as fast as he could. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing, he ran even faster, crying in fear. He looked over his shoulder again, and the bear was even closer. His heart was pounding and he tried to run even faster. He tripped and fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up, but saw the bear right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw and raising his right paw to strike him.

I wonder why ham is one of the main foods consumed on Easter (we had it yesterday)? Of course, to a Jewish person, pig is an unclean meat, so, they probably didn't have it on that first Easter to celebrate the Risen Lord...and I'll bet they didn't have deviled eggs either.
So this is kind of a big deal. It's really common in the world of mommy blogs to run into many product reviews and giveaways and what-not. We're moms. We're thrifty. I get it.
To add up to all this irritation is the IPL.Ok you must have guessed right now that I do not like cricket. I can tolerate it up to a certain level but now in my already pissed off mood ,my husband being glued to it while leaving me to do all the household chores doesn’t help.Watching the IPL quietly is his way of unwinding after a long and hard day at work but it surely works up my irritation up to the danger levels.I really can’t understand why our country has to play so much cricket?Don’t the cricketers need to relax ? Don’t the viewers get tired of watching?Apparently not because some people like my husband and dad can watch cricket 24/7 and still enjoy it.So we have this fights over the remote because I want to watch anything except cricket and for him it’s nothing but cricket.But sometime in the last few days I have given up my fight for the remote and now have some peace.

I have jokes about my mother being an immigrant, which she is. She’s South American. I can not tell you how man Indian people have come up to me after shows and said, “Oh my god, that stuff about your mom. I can relate, I can relate.” It made me realize that the immigrant thing is a universal. Insert Indian/ Latina/ Chinese immigrant mom and change the accent, put your true spin on it, and you’re going to have funny. Just ask Margaret Cho. She does impressions of her Asian mom constantly and it is always funny.

One of the things I like best about houseplants is how manageable they are. They stay in their pots. They don't overrun other plants, and other plants don't overrun them. They are not attacked by cutworms or Japanese beetles. All the watering and spritzing and trimming can be done in a matter of minutes, in one's pajamas. They never need weeding. Best of all, like indoor cats, they are right there, in the most intimate spaces of the house, pieces of God's own wilderness tamed and contained for my comfort and delight.
Fossils are mysterious beasts and their curious nature has fascinated societies for millennia. A couple of centuries on since we established what they actually are it seems so obvious you may feel it should have been certain from the off. But hindsight is a wonderful thing and once the best supported argument has won out it only takes a little time until everyone thinks it was always known. Fossils are lumps of rock, beautifully sculpted into sometimes quite perfect reconstructions of a once living body. They are not strictly the remains of an organism but rather what comes after the remains, the post-remains if you will.

I often wonder whether therapy will be able to help me with these kinds of feelings. The problem with splitting in such severe ways is that even though I’m the one who’s “broken up” with the band, I still have severe and really painful feelings of abandonment.

I have one lead that’s promising. If we can do it, we’d love to set up a foundation to research these phenomena in not just the Big Thicket but areas where this whole range of phenomena occur, the window areas.

Steven Soderbergh refuses to shoot action in the conventional way with his latest, Haywire. In fact, nothing about the movie is inherently conventional. As with The Girlfriend Experience, taking an actress not known for her acting talents, Soderbergh morphs and shapes the film to the lead’s inherent talents. With The Girlfriend Experience, the filmmaker took the inherent seduction and sexuality of Sasha Grey’s porn star past and formed it into a narrative about a high-class escort, pushing the bounds of intimacy. Haywire’s lead, MMA fighter Gina Carano, is a purely physical being in every way, shape, and form. Beyond just her sensual beauty, every move the actress conveys throughout the film conveys a brutality and a sense of violence that belies that sexual exterior. There is no doubt throughout the film that she can kick anybody’s ass.

So, I was shopping the other day and ran into an old friend who asked me how the “book business” was going. I said, “Same as usual. Sporadic sales. Well wishes from friends.” And then she asked me what I was working on, if anything. (A big clue she wasn’t following my blog!!#!). Well, in her defense, she needed a lesson in how to even find it. (I can understand that . . . I’m relatively computer illiterate). But then she asked how I know so much. Huh? Me? (She had read all of my books–Yay!–and was continually amazed at how much info is in them). Well, I said I don’t really know much at all. I do my homework. Research. Research. Research. For instance, John Victor’s current adventure takes place in the region where my brother (the real JV) heard there was lost treasure. The Tucson area. BINGO! I googled Tucson. Learned where the name came from. Learned about some of the mining and treasure hunting there. For instance the copper mine in Bisbee. And the desert! A plethora of info there! The flora, the fauna, the history of a region. Every little tidbit can become one of the building blocks of the story.

Smoking lowers the levels of HDL cholesterol in the blood and increases the risk of blood clot. It makes the smoker more prone to other heart and lung diseases too. For people who have a genetic disposition for suffering from heart diseases, smoking provides the congenial environment for those diseases to develop.

I'll leave the giveaway open until early next week - I am wondering whether I can persuade one of the robins and blackbirds lurking on the table outside my window to do the draw this time. They are very keen on picking bits of food out of bowls - perhaps I could rub the comment slips with bacon fat . . .

"It's not like I didn't work at jobs though," she continues. She worked on projects, did some writing but she didn't take the time to nurture her own interests and career. "A big mistake," she warns.
Sometimes I wonder what the Lisbon sisters did in their day-to-day life. I wonder about the parent’s and how they could have done something so evil to their daughters. I wonder about the neighborhood in which the family lived, and why no one intervened. I appreciate this book because it REALLY made me think. It made me question the people that lived around me and made me wonder if the Lisbon’s lived across the street from me, or next door. Every neighborhood has it’s own version of the Lisbon sisters, and how I would react if something like that existed near me, or what I would do about a bad situation is something I don’t think I can fully appreciate nor answer.

None unless you count teasing names like double battery and four eyes by boys when I studied for the first 6 years in a co-ed school.
It was a great day, with Sue allowing Josephine (my "classmate") and I to play in her studio. We started off with simple mono-printing on paper first, to get the feel of it. This involves painting a canvas sheet with your chosen colour and then laying paper on top. Various techniques were then used to create a design..
Me: You mean the t-shirts I washed and folded for you yesterday while you were out doing your political stuff? Those shirts?
I knew that my skin is oil type. When removing horny substances, it also tightens pores around my nose. What’s more, it soothes my skin so it relieves redness and it keeps moisture. I wanted to show you how to remove horny substances but I forgot to take pictures. People say that it’s not good to use peeling gel frequently but Caolion peeling gel is not only for peeling but also for keeping moisture. so I think we could use it frequently. Everybody! Be a beautiful skin woman with Caolion peeling massage gel!!

The way to retain your reader's attention is not just to make your book page deliver on your headlines, but rather make your headlines deliver your book page. Work backwards. Make the book page sell the book. That's what it's supposed to do. The promo tweet should sell the link to the book page not the book, itself. So focus your promo tweet composition effort on making headlines that work.

Radon is constantly being generated by the radium in rocks, soil, water and materials derived from rocks and soils, such as certain building materials. Radium is a decay product of uranium which is naturally occurring in the soils and rocks of the earth's crust. . . . The radon concentration in a home is dependant on the type of soil the home is built on. Cracks, openings and various penetrations in the building foundation will provide the pathway for the radon in the soil to enter the home. . . .

The porch and the windows came with a yard. Several mighty pin oaks graced the rear along with a French blue hydrangea about the size of the kitchen. At the first sign of warm weather each year the yard came to life as buttercups, lilies and irises popped up all over, flowers planted long ago by a lady that people around town called Mama Deere. She had lived in the house when it was new, before it had indoor bathrooms or closets, along with her husband and five children. One cheerful neighbor told us that when the man of the house passed away he was laid out in the front room for his funeral visitation. Truth be told I often felt a chill pass through the place.
This can also be seen as a continuation of our study of the mighty Roy Ward Baker’s Hollywood period, begun with a look at INFERNO, and who knows, perhaps to be continued with NIGHT WITHOUT SLEEP?
BE REALISTIC!!! Only keep the scraps you know you will use... for example if you cut up 1/2 of a 12x12 piece of paper then you have a 6x12 scrap that can be used on a smaller page, run through a cricut or even to make cards. Don't keep (and I am guilty of this) a random shaped piece of paper big enough for one punch from a decorative punch. What I have come to decide is, if I want to save every little piece is this rule:
I’m staying on the campus of the Hanoi University of Agriculture, which lies about 7 km’s outside the city. The campus is like a little village full of students. And while they are all used to seeing foreigners in the city centre, I tend to stick out here. I have not met or seen another foreigner in this place, and now I would be as surprised to see one as my Vietnamese counterparts.
I have a feeling we'll be having a few more conversations like these over the next few years. Until then, I'll just do my best to prepare for the unexpected.
I hosted a NOVICA giveaway last April (details here) and was very pleased with the selection, customer service and packaging. NOVICA is a fair trade website that works with National Geographic to provide artisans around the world with a place to sell, similar to an Etsy.

The only bright spot was that "House" was on. But then, then they had to go and play Mazzy Star (who I love), which, in my already depressed state, made me think about my totally lost, wasted youth, and I so next thing you know, I was blubbering all over the sink and dripping snot while I was washing the dishes. Yes, thank God I have a dishwasher to sterilize them, and quit getting grossed out; it's not like any of you lot are coming over to eat.
The two additions come on the heels of five licensees in 2011, and the exit from New Jersey's craft beer scene of just two startup breweries since 2010 (Port 44 Brew Pub in Newark and Great Blue Brewing in Franklin Township, Somerset County).

What do I remember most about Framingham? The bagels, lox, and cream cheese. The market where we shopped sold freshly made bagels and lox by the pound at the deli counter. We ate a lot of bagels with cream cheese and lox. It was all I really needed.

How do you cope with something like this? Sadly, it’s something I think about all the time. I’ve mentioned in other posts, the constant internal conversation regarding my future. Will I beat it this time, only for it to come back in a year, and take my life? Just when I think I’m doing a little better and feeling stronger, something happens and I’m reminded that I’m very sick and I can’t just do whatever I want. As a runner, there’s nothing I’d love to do more than to head out for a long run as a way to clear my mind, but this week, I barely had the strength to walk my dog. It’s such a contrast to say, just two weeks ago. That’s what’s so scary to me because every week, every day, every hour is different…and everything could change in a split second. Reality check — that’s the case for everyone..you just don’t think about it as much as I do. I’m hoping this week will be different. I”ll feel stronger and better about what’s to come, but who knows. I never expected any of this to be easy, but sometimes the mental drain of it all is tougher than the actual physical pain. I can handle discomfort and I can even force myself to push through things that other people, admittedly wouldn’t do (50 mile trail runs), but how do you convince your mind to stay positive, when all those doubts start to creep in? The answer — I don’t have one and I guess for now I’ll just keep moving forward, taking it one day at a time.

I had to do it though, to claw back on two days (I think) that I couldn't write because I was unwell. It's hard trying to get your brain to think and type at the same time when all it wants to do is sleep. Boo hoo. I had a stupid virus.
I continue through the Acer Glade, where Japanese Maples dazzle even under the shade of the oak canopy, then past golden-leaved Witch-hazels, clashing vibrantly with a clump of crimson Wing-barked Euonymus, to the exit from Isabella back into the open park. Up the hill towards Gibbet Wood, then downhill to meander through the ancient oaks to Pen Ponds.
Detailed party directives — which can arrive daily at editors’ desks — also restricted coverage related to public health, environmental accidents, deaths in police custody, and foreign policy, among other issues.
D2‘s response to the saga was ‘Oh… I feel sorry for the Chinese child.’. Hilarious.
Didn’t even think about running again. It would be what it was. I would walk the whole damn thing if needed. Better off OCD-ing about weather, something of which you have no control.

I do my best to stay away from political issues. Most people have a hard time separating political opinion from Biblical truth, and I prefer to engage with people in a way that they can honestly evaluate the Truth of his Word. Even when I bring up the Travon Martin case or the motives of political candidates in trying to convince us they can relate to our way of life, my comments aren’t about what side of an issue I come down on but on a biblical principle involved. Not today.

The woodburner will no doubt come into its own later in the year, with the price of oil going up vertically at the moment – last week when I enquired, burning oil was 58p a litre, this week I’m told it’s gone up to 70p… What I don’t understand is a) why this is suddenly happening now – I mean it would have been understandable when Saddam was setting fire to all the oil fields, but why now? and b) why no one seems to have seen it coming. So much for Gordon’s empty promises that the days of boom and bust were over; we now seem to be poised on the brink of the biggest recession in living memory. And of course the rising oil prices are really going to hit those of us that live in the country hard – we’ve no gas supply here (not that that’s going to get any cheaper), and mostly have to drive several miles for basic services city-dwellers take for granted. Still, I suppose if times get really hard we could always burn the pergola…

The messenger is my youngest son, Yasuki Boketsu, who has no head for commerce, is a terrible salesmen, but was a student of the Hida bushi school and possesses a passable ability at hitting things with a dai-tsuchi. He was “inspired” by the show your samurai put on, and has requested that I allow him to join the Paper Lanterns for the duration of this conflict. Being able to say that one of my fourteen children is bravely fighting in the War of Dark Fire will only help boost sales, so I have granted him my permission. If he should die in battle, I will not hold that against you, especially if it is while doing something heroic that would help the image of the Jolly Crab Trading Company.
Not surprisingly, the Native Americans play a part in these mysteries. Supposedly the Indians knew for centuries about the connection between ghost lights and the appearance of these strange man-beasts, but didn’t like to talk to the white man about it. Riggs presents the theory that the wild men may in fact be remnants of the Karankawa tribe, whose members were known, like the wild men, to be ugly, foul-smelling, hairy, physically powerful, and prone to going around naked. Indeed, Riggs supplies anecdotes from people who claim to have seen Karankawas appearing in modern times near Galveston and Trinity Bays.

Now plenty of not so fun things were going on around me as a kid, but my parents did such a good job of sheltering or protecting me from those things. We definitely were always tight on money, my Mom was ill with MS, my sister was a runaway, my brother could definitely be a big jerk, etc. But I can look back and the wonderful fun and carefree times dominate my memories and never fail to bring a smile to my face.

God created you in His image – our God is an awesome and beautiful God. He created us to be awesome and beautiful too! Unfortunately, we are born into sin and living in this sinful World and not living in the fullness of life and awesome beauty that He would love us to experience. But, despite our sin, God still took value in us, he saw beautiful gold within the dirty rock – deep and lost – that he took tremendous effort to come and find us deep in our sinful lives. He sent His son Jesus. He found us and extracted us from our sinful lives. But it is only then that the real process starts in our lives!

I am going to give you a dollar to dream. Dream big. The difference here is you need to dream about being successful in your in the work that you do. Dream how successful you can be and feel what it like to be a huge success. For just a dollar (free) you get to peek into your business future—and see yourself as master of your business domain . For some, it is hard to visualize success that is a real possibility—and much easier to dream about things that are impossible. Now , the great thing about visualizing your success is you can also think about what you need to do to make that dream a reality.
I was looking forward to mile 6.5, when I saw the boy and my brother. I gave a wave, a big smile, and kept moving. But very soon after, it hit me. Nauseau. By mile 10, it wasn’t just a “maybe” my stomach feels funny, it was a “street pizza delivery” kind of stomach feeling. Press on, I said. By now, a friend of mine, Amanda, had found me, though she began in a different coral. After checking in on each other, we both knew we were feeling less than fine. We briefly discussed our goals going out the window and just running as much as we could together, take in the experience, get to the finish.

About ten years ago I was working in the emergency department one summer when late in the afternoon an eleven year old boy was brought in lifeless, the victim of a drowning. Heroic measures were attempted for well over an hour, but despite this, the boy died. As his heartbroken parents gathered his body into their arms, they told me their story in broken sobs. Jordan was their only child. After a number of childless years they had adopted him as a newborn infant. He was the joy and light of their existence. They were very cautious parents and had only just started allowing him a little more freedom. Jordan and his friend were rowing a rubber dingy in the lake when it capsized. For some inexplicable reason he had taken off his life jacket. His friend made it to shore. Jordan did not.

Wow... How do I even being this post?! Okay starting out, a little warning... this is my blog and I have a right to share personal information on here... This is my blog and I am choosing to write something very personal, an account of probably one of the worst days of my entire life. I am not doing this for pity, or out of anger with the Lord; I am doing this so I can personally keep an account of a major struggle we went through and hopefully encourage others if they have been through (or will go through) something similar. I pray this on NO ONE... Let me tell you this in advance, this is terrible, and terrible things happen to all of us, through these trials we are strengthened. Eventhough it has only been about 24 hours, I am releasing the outcomes to God and I have full faith he will restore me and my husband and will allow us to be ever so blessed in the future. All that aside ... let me begin.

The Council faced a difficult choice over the Coniston but we made the wrong one. We may have won a reprieve from opportunist extremists from outside the area who tried to exploit the issue for their own ends, but we missed the opportunity to make a much stronger case for better public services. Experience informs me we should have taken a different path.

Those of you who know me are well aware that I usually do not buy books, for the simple reason that most of the times it’s just skim reading, going through the book (fiction/ non-fiction/ other classifications out there in the universe) and taking away 2-3 key concepts that stay with me. I might return to revisit a few concepts now and then, but am not exactly in love with the idea of ‘rereading’ books.
After Love’s masterpiece Forever Changes was released in November1967 the band started to go though numerous personal changes. Drugs, specifically heroin and LSD, have been reported as a contributing major factor in the band becoming dysfunctional. Lee, guitarists John Echols, Ken Forssi and the other main songwriter in the band Bryan MacLean were all using drugs on a regular basis. Lee had an unusual arrangement with their record label Elektra where all royalties went to him, which also created a lot of tension within the band. Stuart-Ware writes about the ongoing financial issues, where they were promised money that never appeared. MacLean left in 1968 and Love was never really the same.

Dear Virgin Mary, Mother of God, and our Mother and Queen, we beseech thee to offer the Blood of thy Divine Son Jesus, to the Eternal Father to protect families that rely on baby-sitters. We pray that parents will exercise good judgment in selecting qualified and responsible helpers to watch over the little ones and that baby-sitters will be patient, loving and kind in carrying out their obligations and that children who are being watched by their sitters will be obedient, docile, helpful and kind. We ask these things for the greater honor and glory of God, through His Son Jesus Christ, but not our will but His will be done. Amen.

Luk 11:24 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out. 25 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished. 26 Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.

The third problem the United Nations has is its lack of visibility. One solution would be for the UN to establish a space program. This would involve all member nations in a common enterprise, one that would benefit all of us in the long run and would instill a sense of pride in humanity.

And along comes St. Peter,
It’s always better when you find something of your accord, rather than because someone or something is shoving it down your throat.
So, yesterday morning sense prevailed and a nice admin lady phoned to explain that not only was there no way of getting my notes to the two hospitals as patients are still absolutely not allowed to go anywhere near their own notes without applying in writing, but that they'd also booked me in with the wrong consultant so did I want to rearrange. I did and now I've got an apppointment with the nice rheumatologist in about three weeks time. The difference in the way the NHS performs when poorly paid, and generally poorly treated admin staff have the freedom to use their extensive knowledge and common sense organising skills is astonishing. Focusing on that kind of issue from the bottom up, allowing these excellent and dedicated staff members to suggest practical, locally based improvements would certainly improve both NHS performance and experience. However, no-one in government actually listens to me, or anyone else floating around the 'bottom' of the system because it's really far to important to impose top down, opposed by almost everyone, 'we promise we won't do this' reorganisations.

My companion then managed to snap her sunglasses (essential wear), but the bar owner provided some sellotape - the alternative would have been the schoolboy trick of using a sticking plaster! There were some spectacular gardens, and views, as you can see here.
The groups considered that criminal action a terrorist act not only against the company, but also against the right of all U.S. citizens to travel to Cuba, chiefly the right of traveling to share with and help their relatives, added the note.

But, with her marriage, Rachel found her journalistic calling. First, she became a reporter and editorialist for the Observer. When she sought more editorial control, she offended the paper's male staff; so, Frederick bought his wife a newspaper of her own, the Sunday Times, of which she became editor-in-chief.
I'd also advise this; with people's livelihoods on the line, Wisconsin cannot wait for the next election to oust this dictator-in-the-making. They need to recall Paul Ryan now.
I really think that that is crossing a line…In this particular environment I think it’s really dangerous to try and make your point in that particular way because there are people who are taking that kind of thing seriously.

Not only do people hear from the Famous “Dead,” sometimes they get communications from the Famous Fictional, which opens another large can of worms and has made me a bit nervous when I’ve observed it happening to people I knew. I have at least three theories to explain this odd occurrence. One is what the materialists might say, though a bit augmented– that the fictional personage is simply a projection of the mind of a person who felt particularly engaged or affected by that character. Two, that a legitimate, helpful spirit being decided to show up in the guise of the beloved character, in order to more easily and effectively communicate with the person. And three, that certain fictional characters (Sherlock Holmes and Spock come to mind) have such wide appeal, and have had so much human energy invested in them, that they have developed a kind of reality of their own.
Even though I'm currently replacing breakfast and lunch, I still love to focus on having a delicious dinner.
When I arrived the rental car company handed me the keys to a Mercury Grand Marquis. I turned right around and said, "I'm so sorry, but I'm not sure I can drive at all in NJ - much less in a land yacht. Please tell me you have something slightly more drivable?" They did - a mini-van, but I was scared to ask for a third choice. It was hair-raising, but I was only flipped off three times, so I consider it a victory!
There are a million reasons to love it: Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, amazing music and dancing and very cool, yet sophisticated references to black American urban culture.
Remembering the last time we took the bus, I knew to fold up Ryan's push-chair as buses have limits on their insurance on how many they can have un-collapsed with a child inside. So, once we arrived at the bus stop, I suited Ryan up in his trusty bumblebee reins and had him sit on his changing bag while I held one end of the lead and folded the push-chair.

Huh. Imagine that! Isn’t Romney practicing his First Amendment right by tithing to his church? I mean, it’s his money and all, he should be able to spend it where he wishes right? Who is Bill Maher to judge anyone on anything really? Ironic that a man who gave $1 million dollars to a Super PAC instead of directly to the Obama campaign should criticize Mitt Romney for tithing to his church instead of donating to a variety of non-Mormon church related charities.

So naturally, I have spent since last Thursday painting complex figures on wax paper and painting an old pink tire in the most luscious of reds, which is undoubtedly my favorite color to work on, time and time again.
I got my mums at Walmart for just under $4 a piece. I bought four to fill the big planter and they fit perfectly. I know they look kind of pitiful now, but I picked the plants that had not bloomed yet on purpose in hopes that this would extend the time that I get to enjoy them.

Ok, what am I getting at?…The constant fight and discipline year after year was exhausting me physically and tweaking me mentally. Even though I could sit for hours on end and once in awhile experience the most sublime out of body states, I came to realize that the constant fight would ensure my ultimate separation from the very Source I prayed and fought for. I was fighting the very energy (sex) that was needed to feel deeply alive and aware. I found that the more I was able to kill the sex instinct, the more dead I felt on the inside…and my body started to fall apart. I was getting sick for longer and longer periods.

I do the leaves exactly the same way as I did the flowers. I use 3 greens. The first layer is a custom blend I made using YG03 + Colorless blender in a 3 to 1 ratio. I use this to base the leaves. I then add YG03 around the outer edges leaving the centers with just the base color. Next I used YG17 to add deeper shading around the outside, but not covering up all of the YG03 I laid down in the previous step. Lastly I use the base color to go over the entire leaf blending all three shades together.
4. Discount Cigarette Store Employee, age 18: I had a couple of jobs between these 2, but they were boring. This one was hilarious. It was one of those shitty "Cigarettes, Cheaper!" stores in a strip mall in Oak Grove, a crappy Portland suburb. I worked 4 shifts a week, each 12 hours long. I had a coffee pot, I was allowed to smoke inside the store, and I spent the majority of my day sitting on my ass chainsmoking and reading Harry Potter books over and over. I'd pass the time doing stupid shit like hiding a whoopie cushion under my cash register and stepping on it when I went to pick things up, just to see if the customers would say anything.
Even though there is nothing in Jesus’ prayer for asking about anything but basic needs, there are two reasons to imagine that requests can go beyond this. The first is that Paul tells us to pray for everything. “Do not be anxious about anything. Instead, tell your requests to God in your every prayer and petition—with thanksgiving” (Philippians 4:6). The second is the example of the wedding in Cana, where Jesus, in answer to His mother’s request, turned water into wine in a way that exceeded the needs of the party. We have a generous God. When Jesus boils prayer down to “daily bread,” He is encouraging thanksgiving. Ask for anything, expect the basics, and give thanks for everything.
The removal from office of former Durham district attorney Tracey Cline occurred in a tightly-reasoned 14-page (single-spaced) order by Judge Robert Hobgood. The judge took seriously the Cline lawyers’ First Amendment claims—but ultimately rejected them, and in a way that seems almost certain to withstand Cline’s promised appeal.

One day a week or so ago, I decided that instead of getting super frustrated about all the tricks he was pulling, I was going to take pics and post them for you. You know, for a laugh. Yeah. right. 20 minutes into the morning, and I was like... forget. this. So I only have a few, quite tame pictures to show you. There are no pictures of the lotion squirted all over the bathroom floor, my diet coke spilled on the carpet, the files that got renamed because V got on the computer, the look on my face as I find him playing in an unflushed toilet... the spilled milk and cereal all over the floor because he climbed on the breakfast table, the trash strewn all over the kitchen because I didn't remember to put the trash can on top of the high chair like I usually do. AHHHHHH! ... but I love him :)

Life moves on. We grow up, and apart. And it’s not to be cried about. Tears should never be shed that we lost the house. Because we didn’t lose the house: we found ourselves; we found the true directions of our lives in that building. And when the house achieved its goal of setting the four of us on our own paths, it was needed no more in the world, so it left us.
An-y-hoo.

Now is the time of the year that’s most gratifying. The awards season is coming up in just a few months. So this is when possible contenders are released, albeit some with just limited screening, and they aren’t likely to be your Hollywood blockbusters that might stay on for a while. That’s why I opted for ‘An Education’ over the weekend. ’A Christmas Carol’ can wait.

The skills that can be learned through learning a craft are important. Craft can preserve heritage and culture and it is quite often passed down through generations, whether that be in families or through apprenticeships. I think that it is extremely important that we don't loose the knowledge of these skills and how to use them. Wouldn't it be a shame if they were to die out and become lost?
Would I recommend? The Distant Hours was a real disappointment to me. I’d certainly recommend The Forgotten Garden (I even consulted some others who had read that book to be sure it was as good as I remembered. I started to doubt myself after reading this one. They assured me I had not lost my mind or taste in books.) But my advice is to skip The Distant Hours. It’s not a good reflection of Ms. Morton’s talent.

The restaurant was fun—classic, indeed. Boisterous waitresses, mismatched plates, a mix of locals and tourists, and a menu studded with rabbit, lamb and all kinds of offal. Like many of my meals here, the dishes were solid but not to die for.

Prior to the opening of the Coffee Road in 1823, there were very few pioneer families in all of Irwin County ( then encompassing present day Lowndes, Thomas, Worth, Berrien, Cook, Brooks, Coffee Lanier, Tift, Turner, Ben Hill, Colquitt, and parts of Echols and Atkinson counties). Folks Huxford dated the earliest settlement of present day Brooks County. originally part of Lowndes, as occurring in 1823 after the Coffee Road was opened.

Let me tell you what happened. Though Alexander’s tired and sleepy troops could defeat King Porus yet the battle cost them their energy and their enthusiasm and they couldn’t reach the richer kingdoms of India. This is precisely why Alexander’s headgear didn’t have a golden plume in it. But the birds didn’t know that – do they?
Do you feel like this could be another planet? Some alien world that we have never seen before? Well as Jorge points out below, the beach at night is a completely different place void of most people.

So please read the photo account below and then check out the wonderful portfolio of Jorge Maia. His concept of art mixed with photography is breathtaking in many of his images.

Okay, well, I didn't exactly lie, but I changed my mind. Somebody commented that if I hadn't put on the "he's gotta be hot" restriction, she would have totally dressed up her personal man-companion in a quilt and handed him a burrito while she charged up the Minolta. Somebody else mentioned the Starry Night Hollow quilt calendar, and I thought, well, hell. I can't fulfill my dream of making Quilter's Shirtless Man and Spicy Burrito Monthly into a real publication, but I can make a calendar! Or I can if I can get 12 guys to take off their shirts, drape themselves with a quilt, and hold a nice, spicy burrito (and I mean a REAL burrito, not a metaphorical one, ya dirty minded crew, you).
On February 25th, my oldest son had a Lego Star Wars Birthday Party (yes, just getting around to posting about it). My husband and I had kind of decided that having a Birthday Party at a location (like Pump It Up, or Bounce U) would be easiest with a newborn, but my son begged for a Lego Star Wars Birthday Party, AT HOME. So, after several hours searching pinterest for the easiest, least creative, Lego Star Wars ideas I decided we could do it.

Some context might be needed here. When the big break began, I found myself unable to concentrate on my work. I thought it was probably temporary and subsequently spent two years not being able to focus. I could produce a semblance of work, so my lack of focus wasn’t noticeable, but I could feel it. And the further I got into graduate studies, the more I found myself unable to focus on my tasks. Professors who read my prose could tell that I had good ideas but wasn’t able to express them. Since writing had always been somewhat natural to me (in fact, the only activity that gave me any modicum of self-esteem), this was especially difficult. Plus, I was in the English field, where writing is a necessary skill.

The street wasn’t any different now than it had been that afternoon. A few people were on the sidewalk, either while they hurried to and from doorways, cars or just fidgeted as they waited for the bus. One of those absently scratched at hives rising on arms from either exhaust, pollen or even a sunlight allergy. Ben’s own eyes started to itch just from walking past the florist shop on the corner, even though it had installed a second set of doors in attempt to prevent such irritations to the sensitive.

He examines this first as a claim that the “theist without evidence” is violating an ethical or cognitive duty or responsibility that applies to any member of some cognitive or rational community, and that by violating this duty e opens emself to criticism and disapprobation by (other) members of the community, that being the way that communities work.
Will Atkins long ago invited me to toss in any ideas I had on this topic, but the best I could do was mumble about how 'something involving water' might be nice. (Well, it was in an e-mail, so the mumbling was with my fingertips, but you know what I mean, don't you?)

I’ve heard it’s excellent. Have you read it? I’m not big into non-fiction but every once and a while I find them very worthwhile. My hubby, on the other hand, only reads non-fiction! (I’m trying to get him to read Hunger Games to no avail.)
By pulling these tenets into an organized, government-recognized religion, and thanks to the First Amendment separation of church and state, we might spare our "followers" from any and all interference with these tenets.

Many years ago I decided to give eco bags a try. I was living in Sydney with no car so often found myself on the bus or walking down the street trying to lug around my groceries and trying to avoid that horrible moment when the plastic bag rips and your groceries go everywhere! So I am pretty sure my investment in my first eco bag was for vanity sake - I hate chasing rolling cans across the footpath, very embarrassing.

And really, it’s not like I haven’t read anything. I’ve read quite a bit of the English classics, and I’ve read the usual German ones (Goethe, Schiller, and anything else they wanted us to read at school), and some of the international ones, like the Odyssey, and when I think about it, actually I have read quite a lot. But even as I type, I have the likes of Hebel, Storm, Hesse, Kleist, Stifter, … (= all of them are on the ‘should-be-read’ list of German literary canons) staring down at me from the shelf with reproachful bindings. Not to mention all the American and English ones I haven’t read.

This impressive debut collection by a young poet already well-known for his innovative, highly musical poetry draws its energy from an interplay between melody and intellect.

There are only two kinds of emotions, love and fear. If you’re not growing in the state of love then you’re growing in a state of fear. By allowing forgiveness you shift from fear to love and then healing takes place. I took a conscious decision to let go of fear based life and start a fresh with love this time. I also realized that everything happens for a reason and the reason I faced all those problems was to aid me in developing compassion, forgiveness and non attachment.
Reasoning behind Skype Humoticons? “Because nothing can replace the look on your face,” according to a Skype blog post. There is a distinct irony in the campaign. At the same time it blasts Facebook and Twitter, Skype isn’t above using both social networks for promotion purposes.

UPDATE: 27th April, 2012. NAMA has issued a press release in which it says “The list includes 44 properties which were added in March. The total number of properties now listed is 1,195 (some of which are multiple properties such as apartment blocks). The updated listing includes assets which are for sale (with sales agents appointed) and which have an estimated market value, based on price indications guided by sales agents, in excess of €1 billion.”

I had the privilege to spend it with the grade 4 students at Catalina Elementary. They’re soooo tiny. I was expecting, taller, more adult like humans, but was brought back to earth with smaller, more childlike humans. 22 of them. they were very sweet. One of them even had a ‘welcome to catalina elementary’ picture (trees and sunny skies in a ?park?) drawn and colored for me upon seeing me! she then drew me a second picture (a flying jackrabbit!) for after lunch. received several hugs, and a few from the grade 2 class I worked with last week. They’re all very sweet.
In Conclusion: Having a strong online audience can be an amazing tool! Engaging and interacting with that audience is important, not just so they don’t feel ignored, but also because it can drive new business. I happen to know a hair stylist that posts her schedule openings and last-minute cancellations to Facebook and Twitter so her customers can try to slide into those spots or refer other friends that are looking for such a service. Ignoring the potential of your online audience does not just do your customers a disservice, but it also does your business a disservice by alienating those that you could be utilizing.

The main “plot” in this book deals with an extremely manipulative woman with a “heart of ice”, Elizabeth, who is just plain evil to the core. She uses people to get what she wants, without the people realizing what she’s doing. Elizabeth befriends Cassidy (the TV reporter), which almost destroys the friendship “bond” between the three friends. However, with the “Triple Threat Club” working together using their own specialties, they are able to piece together the bits and pieces of the crimes and are able to figure out who Elizabeth really is – the killer (which you, the reader, know from the beginning of the book.)

Take away the videogame technology of killing – America’s contribution to modernity – and the behaviour is traditional. Immersed in comic-book righteousness, poorly or brutally trained, frequently racist, obese and led by a corrupt officer class, American forces transfer the homicide of home to faraway places whose impoverished struggles they cannot comprehend. A nation founded on the genocide of the native population never quite kicks the habit. Vietnam was “Indian country” and its “slits” and “gooks” were to be “blown away”.
“I said, ‘Go Fuck yourself, last time we did this you flaked out on us after three weeks of rehearsal.’ He assured me that he would behave, so how could I say no?

Now I have direction. I am writing down incidents I’ve observed of her bullying myself and other team members, and as I do it becomes more and more clear, with logic and reason, how she has broken her duty of care.

Mao created the Chinese identity under a Marxist-Leninist understanding of history. History according to Marx is the history of class struggle. It conceives the present class struggle as an incarnation of past struggles, a continuation of history through class struggle. Because Mao’s discourse was so widely accepted it became truth. The History of China was of past, present and future. China was great, British imperialism put it to its knees, and now China will rise again. This idea, and the Chinese identity, is accepted by the overwhelming majority of the Chinese.
His father, who was a Congregationalist pastor in Massachusetts, had studied with Jonathan Edwards' student Joseph Bellamy, and Adoniram inherited a deep belief in the sovereignty of God. The great importance this has for my purpose here is to stress that this deep confidence in God's overarching providence through all calamity and misery sustained him to the end. He said, ‘If I had not felt certain that every additional trial was ordered by infinite love and mercy, I could not have survived my accumulated sufferings.’
We strongly condemn the cold-blooded murder and planned assassination of Kishanji alias Mallojula Koteswara Rao, Politburo Member of CPI (Maoist) in Burishol forest area, Paschim Midnapore District, Jangalmahal, West Bengal on 24 November 2011. At the time of this murder Kishanji was dealing with the process of peace talks through the interlocutors appointed by the Chief Minister of West Bengal Ms. Mamata Banerjee. Such a heinous crime should be condemned by all justice loving people.

The drug for my Hypothyroidism? My levels were only slightly off, so I asked the doctors for more time. I wanted a chance to show that I could improve it, because I think I was taking it wrong. SO I isolated it by an hour and a half from EVERYTHING else I put in my body. I think that will be the trick. No increases.
One evening, the kids and I were all lying on my bedroom floor playing twickatweet-bwocks when LG came up and handed me something. "Twickatweet," he said. I looked down, realized what he had handed me, and immediately turned bright red with embarrassment. Why on Earth had THAT been left on the floor?
Ten years ago, I called for people who will be my covenant partners; and several people volunteered. I said it would be for ten years, the ten years are over now and many of them had asked, what’s happening, are we going to continue? I told them I will ask God.

It was a bit of a whirlwind as Scott and I rushed to the 3PM ferry to discover it full. We walked on and abandoned Scott’s choice 1991 Honda CR-X. We took the PCL into Vancouver and checked into the Rosedale on Robson. No sooner had our bags hit the bed, we were taking the elevator down for a quick pint and then the show.
My oldest child graduated from college last weekend. It feels impossible. I feel like I was just in college… He is going to be fine, though he is presently fretting over not having a job. He is one of the most mature, responsible, young men I have ever known. He will do great things and I’m excited to see where things go for him.

Blowing/fingering - If the ball is spinning inside of a cup, players may either blow into the cup or put a finger in the cup it out in an attempt to make the ball fly out before it touches the liquid. Once the ball stops spinning, it is considered "dead", and no further defensive actions will count. Frequently, only females are allowed to blow, while men are allowed to finger. Note that some rules disallow such actions and count them as goaltending.
These land-devouring, car-dependent malls were invented 60 years ago, with Seattle among the pioneers. Now they are in terminal decline. There was a better idea in Kansas City, but unfortunately it was eclipsed by our mania for malls.

Therapist: I am worried for you. I worry if you go, he will try to do something to shut you up or make you lose that baby. He knows that if you report, it will not be too tricky to prove with the pregnancy, which means jail time or likely prison. Not surprised about UTI. Not pleasant. Quiet… does my mention of incarceration upset or scare you?

“In the revealed scriptures it is declared that the spiritual master should be worshiped like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and this injunction is obeyed by pure devotees of the Lord. The spiritual master is the most confidential servant of the Lord. Thus let us offer our respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of our spiritual master.”
This week I decided I'd buy a few more distress inks to continue experimenting but couldn't decide which colours to choose. Unfortunately I've also had a cold and I had one of those nights where you are a feverish and have a recurring dream or thought. My recurring thought was what colours of Tim Holtz distress ink pads should I choose. In the cooler light of day I chose stormy sky, tumbled glass, pine needles and peeled paint which have arrived this morning. I already had chipped sapphire so I'm hoping these will work together.
Awesome place to feeling-feeling. It was cold alright but we were realy happy with the pictures here....
We can all catch more fish by exploiting flavours but flavours are such an incredibly diverse array of substances and they are certainly not just limited to concentrated or natural flavours, essential oils or nature identical flavour components. I was asked this by someone the other day because he had been using a Rod Hutchinson mango flavour in his homemade baits and found that he caught a 5 to one ratio of mirror carp compared to common carp in his lake in spite of there being 5 times more common carp in his lake.
In reality, reaching the pure land is not as hard as it seems. We do not have to die to reach the pure land, rather it is just an issue of completely changing our conceptions of what appears with unshakable and self-reproducing convictions. If I have complete, 100% conviction that I am in the pure land, I actually am in the pure land. A pure land is, in essence, a tantric bodhisattva training ground. In a pure land everything teaches us the truth of Dharma and everything functions to bring us closer to enlightenment. This is what makes a pure land a pure land.

I want some new softball gear. My glove is pretty old and beat up, although I guess if I could pay someone else to re-string it and put some new padding in the palm, that’d save me the time of breaking it in, so I guess I don’t need a new glove. I do, however, want a couple of fancy new bats and maybe some more tape.

So, after a bit of panicking on our end, which included my checking the cost of one-way same-day plane flights (not a good option, we discovered), we decided that we would worry for the rest of the visit (would the cats go insane? was something smoldering somewhere? would someone call the fire department and break down our door while we were still away?), and that it would be best if we headed home after the Christmas lunch. So there was a frenzy of packing and trying to fit everything into Pod's car (which we nicknamed Mr. Creosote for the day) and we hit the road, Jack, sailed through traffic, and ended up at home.

My fellow marketing professionals, I am about to say something profoundly surprising.
This is a serious warning crisis of an imminent collapse of the economy with no evidence that the government is doing anything to salvage the situation.
So what I decide to do is a mini makeover with the money I kept. Here is my before and after pictures of my craft room. I hope you like it.
They describe the place in terms of it being Mayberry (the fictional town for the 50′s show that can still be found in the nose bleed section of cable channels late at night, provided as a community service for easing late night suicidal thoughts), smack dab at a hundred miles from any metropolitan center either west or east on the highway. They describe it as a place where everyone knows everything about everyone else, in intimate details that may or may not be the reality of what happened or occurred. They describe the countryside as pristine and mild, sitting on a thrust of land that over looks forests and twisting rivers that carve the countryside into bisects of islets and pastures. They describe the movement of time as being different there, a central time allotment, dragging with an ease that can be heard in the drawl and song of the words spoken and heard.

On Thursday afternoon, a radicalized Muslim US Army officer shouting, "Allahu akbar!" ("God is great!") committed the worst act of terror on American soil since 9/11. And no one wants to call it an act of terror or associate it with Islam.

Here's a non caloric treat for you:
I sealed the bottom of each plank with a couple coats of sealer since it is the side with the sink.
I marinated cauliflower and carrot with potato, yogurt and some spices. The blend of the spices and yogurt helps make semi-thick gravy, which is perfect with chapati, naan, or with rice. I used a little sugar in marinate to give it a thin-crunchy layer. I want to strees here that don't worry about sweetness from sugar as it doesn't get added to the taste of the subji.

so, i'm back. did some tech things finally...loaded firefox, so there are more bells and whistles here, but of course, that means there's MORE tech stuff to learn. been checking in on all ya'll's blogs...prolific bunch, i might add, and fascinating, too! i read dh yesterday and i remembered a comment made ages ago by a colleague when i mentioned burroughs (i guess naked lunch had just hit the movie screen)"burroughs? oh yeah, he wrote the tarzan books" two things hit me again...one, the sad state of education and two, how fortunate many of us are to have received one that allows us to discuss/disparage/appreciate literature. we are privileged, but then i ask myself, does that make me an elitist? or a reader? of course, i don't know jack about nascar and my friends who do think only slightly less of me...which makes them elitists...i'm rambling...
I came out to the deck after the above described procrastinating and finally sat down to complete my morning pages, in the afternoon. My morning journal has been something quite helpful to me, beginning initially as a means to diarize my “feelin’s and emotions” and then later progressing to what it has now become, more a hardcover chat with myself. It’s where I can record anything and everything, no topics left unturned, but primarily just a method to let some of my thoughts out. It’s amazing how the process of writing down something, anything, can establish a flow of thought, of ideas, and feelings. It was these thoughts and feelings that I want to capture here, so here I am. I don’t want to neglect my paper pages but as I started to chat with myself in them I realized that here was where I wanted to be, not only on my deck but writing here on this blog. Why? Can’t say exactly, other than my hope is to inspire some thought within someone else, perhaps inspire them to step onto their deck or into their yard, and let the beauty of life surround them.
One of the problems with all of this voting for bigger government is that there is less money for people to make their marriages and families work. The more we vote for bigger government, the less we haves as individuals for our own plans, including our marriage and family plans.

How to catch up on your sleep when your night-owl, needs only five hours a night husband is gone:
Whatever the cause, there is something about Marge that has lead to a lot of her fears being reversible or at least partially reversible. She is extremely responsive to classical conditioning, whereas a lot of other fearful dogs aren't. That leads me to believe that it was her upbringing that caused her to be fearful, rather than a biological reason (which may have required medication to reverse). But I might just be pulling that out of thin air.

My go-to person for graphics is Nevada artist Beth Neumann, who whipped up a darling design and put it in her new shop, Tattered Notions. She posted an informative, well-researched list of links for those who wish to transfer any graphic on fabric here. I’m big on doing everything myself to save money, but fabric transfers require an investment in equipment and a learning curve. My $18 pillow cover from Beth saved money as well as time.

Students of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may often miss the real impact of Shas on the Israeli political system, an impact felt especially when push comes to shove and a ruling coalition needs enough support to continue toward a negotiated political solution. On the face of things, Shas presents itself as a purely socio-religious machine within the Jewish Israeli milieu. It comes across as one of Israel's interest-group parties looking to one sector for support, and advocating on that sector's behalf.
Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) who used his democratic power to free slavery and brought the democratic principles of liberty and equality for all to its height then, had thought that democracy is the best, that a “government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”
Always stay in your lane when you are working for narcissistic boss. The immediate gains that you get will be at best be temporary and the long-term effects can be devastating. Just relate to them on a professional basis. Don’t let their false promises and invitations lure you in. Do your job well and stay in your lane. Maintain proper boundaries and you will survive the narcissistic boss.
When we got there, the Alcocks were out, so we talked to the African bloke who worked in the office. We gave him a copy of the Message to read, and he too said it was about time that the church said this, but he thought it was too late, and that it was a waste of time distributing the Zulu version, becuse only the whites had the power to change the situation. He said he wasn’t prepared to do anything about it himself, because he didn’t want to end up on Robben Island. We tried to convince him that he could put pressure on the church, but having been brought up in an authoritarian church tradition, he said he thought the clergy must give the lead and tell the laity what to do, and not the other way round.

Though I am completely exhausted from non-stop house work this weekend, it is nice to look back and see all that was accomplished. I barely have enough energy to write this post so bear with me. (At least when I started it I felt that way. That’s probably why it took me 3 days.)

At this point, I was checking my email every hour or so. I knew that her mother took her to her house in Elk River, so there was no point in thinking that she was going to be at her apartment anyway. I finally heard back around 7:00 that night that she would check on my stuff the next day when she got back. Since there was nothing to be done about that, I called my phone, figured that if no one was answering it it must be in her apartment because the ringer was on, and left it at that. So another night was spent in Woodbury.

Moore proceeds from a sincere and controversial first principle: Scotland is really a rather pleasant and interesting place. . .As a work of popular scholarship, though, it’s in a different league to the Scottish novelty titles that get stocked next to the bookstore tills as potential impulse purchases, those little handbooks of parliamo Caledonia and regional braggadocio, such as Weegies vs Edinbuggers.' - Allan Brown The Sunday Times, 21 September 2008

By the time we got back to Aguas Calientes, I was absolutely exhausted. We'd actually done quite a bit of hiking. We had just enough energy to change, go get dinner (nothing to write home about that time, unfortunately, we tried a Peruvian take on Mexican food... not so great), buy water for tomorrow (we'll be filling up our camel baks with bottled water), and head back to the hotel.

I want to start anew in 2012 and as a beginning we rearranged my (our) workroom. It is really very tiny and I have to share it with Mr. Beam who does his computer work in there as well. Can you imagine the sound of typing (or better hammering) on a keyboard and the chattering of a sewing machine at the same time? You shouldn't. But we manage! In the course of the refurbishment and reorganisation I had a proper look through all the materials which I've collected over the past months. Amongst it is another 1920's Suffolk Puff Quilt top, similar to the "twin" one I purchased earlier this year, but with still vibrant colours. I can't wait to put my hand on it.

“Nasty gap that”
Men of War: Condemned Heroes tells the story of one of the infamous Soviet penal battalions during the WWII. These battalions are famous for being formed under Stalin’s “No step back!” order #227. They consisted of court-martialed officers that were given a chance to redeem their crimes, or incompetence, in blood by serving as the lowest enlisted rank in a battalion that was assigned the most dangerous tasks. These battalions’ images are surrounded by many myths, and this game tells the truth about these regiments based on real evidence from their former members.
Thanks for your consideration,
The reality is that power comes from acting as a group, in the interests of that group—as La Raza, the Umma, and the Tribe all demonstrate. Blindness to this, like almost any blindness in nature, is a weakness and leads to extinction.

Let’s begin with a little back story. Last year, I found myself in a bit of hot water on Twitter when I said the thing that, as a classic movie fan, you’re not really supposed to say: I do not particularly like Citizen Kane.
Redeeming Love by Francine Rivers -- I've been wanting to get to this, but I think I will read The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins first, a re-read in preparation for the movie's release in March. I listened to the audiobook the first time, years ago, and I'm not sure if I'm going to listen again, or if I'll read it. I did borrow the book free, thanks to the amazon prime kindle lending library, so I can do whichever. I did enjoy the audio version, but I wonder if reading it might be a different experience.

As a child did you ever read The Butterfly Ball, and the Grasshopper’s Feast? This was a trippy 70′s book the like of which I had never seen until a visit to my friend Stacey’s house. Stacey’s family lived at the back of her mother’s hairdressing shop on Rotherham Terrace, Miramar in Wellington (NZ) – know the place? It had the 80′s pink and black sign writing on the window well into the 90′s. Stacey was way cool, she had the Grease record (we never even had a record player), her mum had big hair and smoked – and was pretty relaxed about things. Even when the dog ate the whole birthday cake at her party held in the salon. And she had cool jewellery, actually I pinched an orange plastic bangle from her once – I am so sorry Stace.

This Easter bread recipe was not an exception. I asked her for this recipe when I was still in college. I had rarely if ever worked with yeast, and I had never made bread. While she knew how many eggs and how much yeast I needed to use, she said that I should add "enough" flour and "some" cinnamon and lemon zest. When I asked what she meant by enough, she said, "as much as you need." Feeling confused, but determined to have Easter bread that year, I set to work. I also decided at that moment to start writing down what I did each time I made her recipes so that I would have them going forward. After three attempts in a week, I not only had my Easter bread, but documentation of the recipe.
It's Friday afternoon! Don't these weeks just seem to fly and the time is a-ticking! I have had such a busy week and I know there is a busy weekend that lies ahead! It's all good though and my creativity is definitely keeping me busy.
There are still a few bits and pieces to do aside from the final coats of paint. We need to put up cornising which will cover the rougher filler that's in the gaps and we need to create a frame around the pipework in the corner of the kitchen.

The case for a citation declaring Holder in contempt will be laid out in a briefing paper and 48-page draft citation distributed to Democrats and Republicans on the committee.

There’s also some great tidbits in here from Active Birth; not so much from a physioloical perspective, more like the reiteration that movement and staying upright is helpful whether on “dry land” or in the water. She also points out that the pool actually facilitates movement as you’re less inclined to get into bed and have greater freedom of motion (one of the birth story quotes talked about being able to move quickly from an all-fours position to a squat which is quite a feat on dry land). Plus you’re in your own little bubble where you can be free to concentrate inward which is a major bonus for me.

I'm also experiencing a different type of emotion this time around. Last pregnancy I would get sad that it was no longer going to be just me and Patrick. But now, I feel guilty that Lyla's life is about to change more than she'll ever know. I feel sad that I won't be able to devote all of my time and energy towards her and that she'll have to share Patrick and me. I guess it's normal to feel this way. To Patrick's point, he almost feels guilty for the new baby that it'll never get total focus and devotion like Lyla had for almost 3 years.
So how can we use this to our benefit? I could push color around to fix mistakes. This poor snail was not colored very carefully. I used YG41, BV31, and YR31 and as you can see, the BV and the YR went out of the lines. No worries, this is where my colorless blender comes in to fix my sloppy work.

Fortunately, Austin has just the place where you can satisfy the peskiest military fix: the aforementioned Camp Mabry.

The adjoining room on the same side of the house is the library, and as benefits its character, the finish is in somewhat somber colors. The carpets and walls are of terra cotta tone.

Anyway, yesterday, March 27th, was the official publication date of Storming Heaven, the final novel of the Star Trek: Vanguard series conceived by editor Marco Palmieri and writer David Mack and published by Pocket Books. The seventh novel (and eighth book, overall) in the series brings to a close a story that took the better part of eight years to tell. I know I’m biased, but I think Dave did a wonderful job bringing the whole thing to a rousing conclusion.
As we look at the Illinois economy, the good news is that we have matched the US growth for the past 11 months (through September 2011). CNN Money reported today that initial jobless claims fell to the lowest level for the first time in nearly 4 years. This is a good sign as we look for improvements in the labor market.

And millions of people in the townships face a hungry Easter: the food shops are emptying out and the petrol stations report widespread closures due to lack of fuel.

And several of the schools asked the kids to reflect in writing on their experience. And this is what helped us to know that we were onto something here. One of the students described herself as “a pretty regular fifth-grader who loves sweets.” And afterwards, she wrote that her time in the garden -- and this is a quote -- “has made me think about the choices I have with what I put in my mouth.” Hey -- winner!

So, big day yesterday for sure. To round out my day of training my husband, son and I went out to dinner for a victory meal. I deserved an Ellies Brown Ale and shared some chicken nachos with Jay. Then, who of all people walked into the restaurant? Yes, none other than the author of Running by The Book, Corinne! We were both with our families and I was so happy to see her! She already knew about my 3 mile victory! I wanted to just tell her all about what I’m telling you. I wanted to share my 3 mile experience with her then, but we were with our families and it wasn’t a good time. I would say that this was a strange coincidence that Corinne walked in but it wasn’t. God is good! Pray with me about God’s goodness….

Dear Fairweather Friend-
Now I understand what David was writing about in the book of Psalms.
Now that the spring rain has fallen (we had rain, rain, and then MORE RAIN here in Ohio) and the temperatures have finally heated up, the landscaping, (seemingly neglected while the house was on the market) was turning into a jungle! I had cleared away a crazy amount of dead "stuff", trimmed back the shrubs, drained and dredged the koi ponds, and planted flowers in the weeks leading up to my parent's visit. Still, the property needed some serious TLC. With my parents working side-by-side from morning until after dark for 2 days straight with my husband and I, the lawn finally underwent a noticeable transformation. Trees were trimmed and cleared, our front fountain is now running, the deck has been power washed, you can finally see the beautiful brick walkway around the house, gutters are cleaned, the outdoor lighting is now up and running, and the flower beds are weeded, organized, mulched and actually look like landscaping rather than an overgrown jungle. Sure, there is still a ton of work to be done with the ponds, our garden, and the beds at the back of the yard. But around the house it truly looks like the "after" shot on an HGTV program. (I really wish that I had taken "before" pictures). Hooray! So a BIG thank you to my mom and dad. Mom, I really am sorry about that wicked case of poison ivy that you took home with you (I'm suffering right along with her on that one! I am the Calamine queen today.). And Dad, I am sorry about your back. Hopefully you both recover soon. : ) Next time I promise we will just go sight-seeing, do some shopping, and maybe go to a movie. Love you guys!
On the flip side, because there is *always* a flip side, there are these great conquests for love and heroes and heroines make these great strides in the name of their love and their future and what-have-yous. I mean Helen of Troy launched a thousand ships and stuff, right? Love, lust, power, whatever. They’re all basically the same.
The problem with this has been that when predictions are given to you, instead of you uniting to make the predictions manifest, we notice that you form back into your old ways of duality; splitting yourselves up between those who believe the prediction is ‘real’ and those who believe it is not genuine. This collective expression of separation is what has been holding you back in the avenue of manifesting predicted events.
Gifts are supposed to be something more than a formality and a duty. They are supposed to pay tribute to the giver and the one to whom the gift is being given. The gift we give reflects not just ourselves, but our relationship with that person. An example that comes to mind is a birthday gift that I gave to my friend Brian some years past. He was in the midst of his new business which took up almost all of his leisure time. I knew that he used to play the harmonica in more leisured times and for his birthday I got him a new one and some harmonica tunes. It was a sign from me to him to relax a bit more, take some time, and remember his past-times. It was not pricey, but also not something I could just pick up from the supermarket on the way to this birthday dinner.
And, as Siegel said in the film, Goldstein said, "it’s not about money." His neighbors were opposed to the project but couldn't deal with the fight: "I don’t blame them one bit."

Every time I started to bring in one of my earlier stories or poems, the inspiration would come to a screeching halt and the writing would become a nightmare. So I just stopped fighting it and let it be its own story. Some hints of "Momma and Me" and "The End of the World" have already appeared in the novel, but the details are completely different. The time, locale, even some of the characters are different and it's interesting seeing the stories go from an almost memoir sense (the shorter pieces) to fiction in the novel.

Wanting to explore how others use lace in their art, I will share those findings with you as well.

‘….A Greek dinner-party was a handsome, well-regulated affair. The guests arrived elegantly dressed and crowned with flowers. A slave, approaching each person as he entered, took off his sandals and washed his feet. During the repast, the guests reclined on couches with pillows, among and along which were set small tables. After the solid meal came the “symposium” proper, a scene of music, merriment and dancing, the two latter being supplied chiefly by young girls. There was a chairman, or “symposiarch”, appointed by the company to regulate the drinking, and it was his duty to mix the wine in the “mighty bowl.” From this bowl the attendants ladled the liquor into goblets, and with the goblets went round and round the tables, filling the cups of the guests.’ (1915 Edition: pp. 1682-1683).
She talks in a kind of sing-song way, bubbling and vivacious. She talks their language and connects with them not as an adult per se, but as a sort of űbercool older sister.

When Michael was discharged, DeBow picked him up at the airport — and was staggered. “When he got off the plane and I picked him up, it was like he was an empty shell,” she told me. “His body was shaking.” Michael began drinking and abusing drugs, his mother says, and he terrified her by buying the same kind of gun he had carried in Iraq. “He said he slept with his gun over there, and he needed it here,” she recalls.

I imagine I’m placing my lips at the waistband of your boxers, starting with feather-light kisses and then gently nipping at your skin before tugging them down a bit with my teeth. They slide down your hips easily, revealing the line of muscle that makes a perfect V, an arrow guiding me where I want to go. My mouth and tongue trace that line with painstaking deliberateness.

Lina Kennedy, the founder of Alexandria Professional, introduced us to the Alexandria Professional method to sugaring. This method of temporary hair removal uses an all natural sugar gel-like formula made from natural ingredients that removes the hair follicle from the root. The removal process is done with the natural direction of hair growth, unlike waxing, where removal happens against the natural direction. The sugaring formula contains no chemical additives and is 100% natural. It is non-comedogenic, which just means it will not clog your pores. This method, which is gentler and safer than waxing, can lead to hair growth reduction is safe and effective on men and women and all skin types.

Well, like I said, I was boarding at my future in-laws. I always grabbed a bowl of cereal before heading to school in the mornings. Well, one day future SIL announced that she was out of cereal but she had made granola for me. Um, gulp! Ok, sure. I didn't want to hurt her feelings so I took a tiny bit. After the first bite, I scarfed it down and took a much bigger helping. Surprise! It was not only good - it was delicious!

Throughout Deadlocked, I wanted to smack some sense into both Eric and Sookie. I want them to work out, to get together, to stop being so stubborn. If they were a real life couple, I’d say they need to figure out how to communicate with each other. But they aren’t real. They are characters, and it would be boring if their relationship was easy.
The back layer of each ruler is white to provide an easily visible background for each of the other layers of the ruler. On top of this white base ruler you flip over clear, see-through layers that represent different measurements (as stated above). Each of these layer's have it's own colored tab for easy flipping and each set of measurements are marked in different colors so each can be easily seen as more layers are flipped over on top. All ruler layers are bound together with small, hard, plastic tubing-like pieces, sort of like a comb-binding but broken into several pieces.
The CG sets and scenes are incredible and you really do have to hand it to the film that these things are as good as they are. Yes, it’s bad form to rest the entirety of a film on the special effects and neglect the story somewhat (that’s right Avatar, I’m looking at you as well) but they really were spectacular.

Now your two remaining pieces need to be stuck to the 3rd and 4th panels from the left. This is quite hard to show so I have done these to panels in a different colour.

On August 5, 2010, Governor Deval Patrick signed S2582: An Act Relative to Economic Development Reorganization, which permitted local wineries to sell wine at farmers markets, fairs and festivals. I have always supported this law, and it has been great to visit local farmers' markets and see wineries showcasing their products. Many local wine stores actually do not carry Massachusetts wines, so the wineries really do need additional outlets for their products, such as farmers' markets. There is now evidence that this was a very positive law and has significantly helped these local wineries.

Eventually we made it out of Miami and onto Highway 1. The first highway in the U.S. I don’t know if this means it was the first one ever, or it’s just the first one they got round to numbering, but it’s number one! The road ahead was long, and we drove for several hours, all getting to know each other better. Listening to Sergio and Corstan talk was humbling, both using English as a second language and communicating with what appeared to be ease as they claimed that their limited vocabulary was made things difficult. We took a break for food at a Waffle House, which was my first real experience of the American diner.

I've been on tour in Europe since the beginning of July. July was filled with amazing festivals in France, Switzerland, and Belgium, club shows in the UK, and some splendid down time in Paris, London, and a few other spots. Since the beginning of August, we have had time off in a beautiful apartment in Brussels. We had a big gap in the touring schedule, and it made more sense to stay here rather than fly home and back again. What an opportunity - to truly live in a foreign city! So many of our adventures on the road are enjoyed in fast-forward, zipping from city to city, sometimes barely having time to come up for air. This, on the contrary, has been quite different, indeed.

What is there to say? If that’s the level to which criticism and discourse has sunk in the States then things really are in a bad way. It seems the justification for this kind of venom was Breitbart’s own invective. Soon after the death of Senator Edward Kennedy he described him as “villain”, a “duplicitous bastard”, a “prick” and “a special pile of human excrement.” The favour has now been returned, with one Kenneth J Bernstein greeting Breitbart’s death using the same terms in a diary entry on the Daily Kos, seemingly an American political blog that publishes ‘progressive’ (how I loath that word) views.

I had a creamy white Flotaki rug that had never been put back in place after its last cleaning, so I lent the rug to TA's mom, to put under the table in her breakfast area. It really warmed up the space and made the space functional, attractive, and more than just an after thought. I arranged her displays on the mantel, a baker's rack, and some small shelves. All in all, we made no big changes, we just made a lot of little changes that brought the rooms into a more focused and usable arrangement.

Interesting is that the first bottled products rolled out of the Manila factory in an October day – the month when the German’s celebrates their beer festival – “oktuberfest”.
Clearly, Hollywood has had a steady hand in turning America away from her conservative Christian roots to new age occult beliefs and practices. Pantheism appeals to the Hollywood crowd because it teaches that we are all God and that we need not be concerned about being obedient or accountable to a personal God who created the universe. However, it is not only Christ-rejecting directors who are seeking to get the world to embrace the worship of the earth under the guise of their imaginary Mother Earth Goddess; it is also the leader of the global warming movement himself, Al Gore.

I wanted to go for a nice walk this morning, but doing regular maintenance on my car meant I couldn’t do that. There was no way I was leaving my car on jack stands to do such a thing. Also I could drive to the Mall for a walk either. I may still get out this evening after dinner. We shall see.

My thought was that the new eight power conferences would consist of ten schools each, play a round robin conference schedule and do away with a championship game. For the four conferences with more than 10 members currently, I proposed a “last in, first out” rule with regard to which schools get shuffled out.

This doesn’t mean, of course, that The Strong One couldn’t come from Labour’s ranks. Harriet Harman is the most obvious candidate, if only because she has form when it comes to (a) openly saying she’d change any law at any time to get a post-dated conviction (b) targeting hate-sectors like bankers and white, older males, and (c) being so clearly bigoted and at least part way round the twist in her gender views. But Hattie herself knows she is unelectable – hence her support for Ed Miliband, as the great hope for becoming a sort of surrogate mother, hatching mad schemes and ‘equality’ quotients on Harmperson’s behalf.
Here’s a few books I hope to read this summer:
The reggae icon is the subject of a new documentary, "Marley," from Oscar-winning director Kevin Macdonald ("The Last King of Scotland"). The film, which features interviews with Marley's surviving family members and reggae contemporaries like Bunny Wailer and Junior Marvin, premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival (reviews here and here) and the SXSW Film Festival. It will be released theatrically and through video on demand on April 20, a date whose coded significance will resonate with those who understand its significance.

Please note that there is no such thing as an international patent. Under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) you can file a standard national or regional patent application (international patent filing), and designate one or more countries. After that each jurisdiction decides whether or not to grant you a patent for that designated country. The moment of the international patent filing establishes the filing date for all designated countries. 18 months after the filing date or the priority date, the international application is published by the International Bureau at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in one of ten languages, which includes Chinese. In case the international patent application only designates the U.S., this publication is not automatically published.
Aside from the Kennedy affair, E-town was a notoriously rough place. When one defendant was asked to be tried in a different city because he figured he couldn’t get a fair trial in Elizabethtown, some citizens just took the man from the sheriff themselves and hung him, pinning a note to his coat that read, “So much for change of venue.”

After Gordon Brown's dodgy claims regarding The Sun this week we can see that the, mostly politically motivated, anti-News International campaign is resorting to lies and smears to progress it's agenda. It may seem like natural justice for the press, and I wouldn't be too bothered, if it wasn't for the fact that all this energy is being focused on one organisation, mostly because it upset a political party when it turned it's back on them. The worry is the wider problem in the press generally won't be addressed. What we need is the same tenacious focus on The Mirror, People, Mail etc. No one seriously suggests they've not been using similar methods as the News of the World. It will be interesting to see if Labour MPs maintain the same level of passion and indignation and the BBC continue wall to wall news coverage, when the story moves on to the non-News International papers and, God forbid, Labour papers like the Mirror and People.

With a diamond shaped face, the face is smaller at the eye – jaw line with a smaller forehead and chin, the angular features and very present cheekbones are somewhat similar to the square faces. In order to properly accentuate the cheekbones and bring balance to the general facial traits, it is highly recommended to choose for more upswept frames like the cat eye or the oval frame for your sunglasses or eyeglasses.
Ok, now that we have got all that out of the way, let us get down to the real reason I am writing this blog post. Couple of my friends had their CAT exams one day apart. The first guy (let us say MP) who falls into the category of “no studying, and yet writing”, successfully attempted the paper and got back home. Later in the day, the second guy (let us say RP), who also falls into the category of “no studying, and yet writing”, called MP up to ask him for advice as to how to tackle CAT. MP replied very seriously:
Willard wonders to himself how, if this is how the war is being fought by those still in the good graces of the military, any man could go far enough to get sentenced to death like Kurtz has. But through the letters and recordings we hear about Kurtz, we’re given an image of a man who seems like he should be a war hero. He doesn’t present as insane in Willard’s file, he presents as capable and driven by some unwritten desire that’s beyond the scope of the army.

Is the answer to the first question unconnected with the intention of the third party or does it depend on his conduct, a decisive point being whether the third party applied for and registered the later Community design after receiving an extra-judicial demand from the proprietor of the earlier Community design calling on him to cease marketing the product on the ground that it infringes rights deriving from that earlier design?"

Keep in mind the numerous and escalating wars and the common theme of “Israel first” in the cavalcade of presidential hopefuls. This also makes no sense, if you aware that Israel must be destroyed before the 1,000 years of peace on earth. And it gets even wackier when some evangelists have openly stated that Jews will not be required to accept Christ as their savior in order to get into heaven. At the same time, they are supposed to do battle with an entity that their own Bible has told them is the “Anti-Christ” and who will rule from Jerusalem. According to Jewish teachings, the Hebrew Messiah will do largely what this anti-christ will do and these same Israel supporters are well aware of this and yet continue to garner money and support for Israel.

If I had written that in the 1980s (during my formative highschool and college years), folks might have said, “Well, that’s not real courageous.” They might have said that because my beloved Bulldogs won a national title and came in second during those years. (It’s also when the Great One was there.) They routinely beat the Gators (that’s right children… there was a time when the Bulldogs could actually beat the Gators).

If the three or four action scenes that punctuate the body of the film seem a bit boilerplate, with the likeable team of Asgard heroes not getting much time to strut their stuff even when the film sets us up for that in the finale, it feels like an acceptable lack nonetheless, because Thor retains dramatic cohesion. Branagh manages to invest it with emotional immediacy. The pain of Loki, the confusion and regret of Thor, the anger of Odin, and the earthly emotions of Jane all make an impression, and give impact to the familiar but still enjoyable moments when Thor’s fellows come to his earthly aid, and his self-sacrifice results in his power being restored, perhaps the most rousing moment I’ve seen in a superhero flick since the resurgence at the end of Superman II (1981).

I support both a movement to create a real political left in the United States (as opposed to the faux-left of the Democratic party) AND a 99% percent movement that exposes the gulf on issues where the bipartisan Washington consensus trumps a majority, or even a super-majority of Americans. But they are not the same movement. They are also not mutually exclusive. An ascendancy of the left is not the same as a movement of the 99%, and yet there are left issues that enjoy super-majorities in public opinion polls. The necessity of creating a hyper-popular movement to oppose those components of the bipartisan consensus that frustrate the political will of a majority of Americans is not the same as a movement to reinvigorate and re-empower the political left.

Episode 1 was very dialogue heavy, which may turn people off from the series, but not me; I love my dialogue in anime. Hyouka is going to be 21 episodes (kind of a weird number) so there is no rush for the plot to kick in. I expect there to be some more character development and some new characters before we eventually get to the plot. The show has potential and should be interesting, I look forward to seeing some more of it.
Propaganda prevailed in Japan. Are we any different? We see the same images of “terrorist” torturing and decapitating innocent civilians – but is that a true cross-section of those who oppose us? Can we really label everyone who opposes America a terrorist, a murder, a religious zealot hell bent on the destruction of a Christian nation – or is there something more complex, more logical?

The rice: Fry rice in oil with soy sauce, white pepper, salt, and 5 spice powder. Fry rice in batches if your pan is fairly small. Once fried, add water and the reserved liquids (from soaked mushrooms, run off from pork, peanut soaking liquid). The rice to water ratio should be 2:1. For every 1 cup of rice, add 1/2 cup of liquid. Stir the rice constantly like a risotto. Do not fully cook the rice until done. You should only partially cook the rice. When cool enough, mix the cooked peanuts with the rice.

A battle to control the soul of the president, not unusual in any administration, was under way. While the conservative, hawkish in de pen dent oilmen thought he was insufficiently loyal to their cause, the Rockefeller Republicans felt the same from their side. Writing in the Dallas Morning News, Robert Baskin noted fears among the Eastern corporate elite that Nixon was being dominated by the right wing. A few months later Baskin further underlined the point in an article headlined “Divisiveness Within GOP Rising.” In truth, Nixon’s reign was a highly complicated one, far from doctrinaire, with issues handled on a case- by-case basis. Thus, Attorney General John Mitchell could say the administration was against busing but for desegregation. Nixon himself could complain about people in his administration being too tough on corporations, yet his Justice Department aggressively pursued antitrust actions that angered industry. While waging the Vietnam War, Nixon held secret peace talks with the North Vietnamese Communists. He also produced a series of liberal-leaning reforms, including creating the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. And Nixon implemented the first major affirmative action program. But some of his Supreme Court nominees leaned far to the right, and Nixon and his attorney general championed tough law-and-order tactics against political protesters and dissidents. His presidency was a mixed bag, meaning no one was entirely happy, and everyone perceived someone else as having the

Urban Catholics and immigrants were against Prohibition because it simply seemed unnatural to them; well, it was.

They were semi-interesting characters playing out a semi-interesting sub-plot, but they didn’t really have anything to do with the Doctor.

Well folks, I’m here to say that I’m going to give this a try one more time. I have, hopefully, fixed the issues that were keeping me from success in the past. I now have a plan. Unlike the Shakespeare in a Year project, I know that I can’t finish a play in a week. There are too many other things going in my life for that. But I do think that I can finish one in about three weeks on average. I have listed out all 38 plays, figured out which ones I am interested in reading first, and set a schedule to complete one every three weeks between now and the end of the year (that is 13 plays). As I get closer to the end of the year, I will plan out more of the plays for next year.

She examined Olivia, and shared her insights with us. She made it very clear that Olivia's AMC is not my fault. (She saw the momma guilt in my eyes, I think.) We talked some about Olivia's autism, and Dr. Hall said she has seen some other children with AMC and low-functioning autism. I wanted to ask her if she happened to have their names, addresses, and phone numbers handy. Because, you know, those are our peeps!

I doubt that there is much support for either of these assumptions and this adds to my growing feeling of unease that the diagnosis would become not much a a post-hoc excuse employed by lawyers and defence teams as a means of excusing defendants behaviours and reducing sentences for rape.

This is what we get in terms of character development. Mr Palomar may begin the book fully formed, as a man who needs order in a chaotic universe, but his personality, his curiosity and his innate sadness are gradually peeled down as we read more about him. His need for meaning is frustrated when he visits the ruins of Tula in Mexico. He knows that “in Mexican archaeology every statue, every object, every detail of a bas-relief stands for something that stands for something else that stands, in turn, for yet another something.” He knows that “every translation requires another translation and so on … to weave and re-weave a network of analogies.” (My own search for meaning made me wonder if this paragraph was a sly reference to Calvino’s longtime translator, William Weaver, with whom he collaborated on his English language translations. “I had problems with Calvino,” says Weaver, “because he thought he knew English.”) Yet he overhears a school teacher assuring his class, visiting the same ruins, that “we don’t know what they mean.” By this time in Mr Palomar’s story, we feel like smiting the teacher ourselves. Our hero, ever enquiring, never certain, is far slower to state his conclusions.
It is possible that most of us suffer from this terrible affliction - our bodies running away from the soul, mostly because we are very confused. We are not sure which one is which - 'who' is running the show at this very moment - therefore the 'split soul.' Only when we connect with our 'Inner Self' and therefore to Nature - we can recognize 'the other' for what it really is.
This is Nature’s typical cycle of animals either re-emerging after winter hibernation or subsisting on their fat during long cold winters in the northern hemispheres when temperatures drop well below freezing and there is less plant life for food.

About a month ago I went on my lunch time run on a very cold but sunny say. I was making great time with my first mile at an 8:15 pace. I ran past the main pavilion and started to make the first turn that headed towards the nature areas. About 10 yards ahead of me I noticed a big bunch of keys in the middle of the path. Without missing a step and keeping pace I gracefully swept up the keys in my right hand. I knew someone would be in desperate need of these keys. I figured I would get back to the parking lot and see if anyone was missing keys. Or I could hit the panic button on the key fab setting off the alarm and wait to see who would claim the large heavy key filled ring. It was cold day so the park was not that crowded.

So, back to the story - 16 year old Katniss Everdeen (yes, everyone has weird and bad names in this book, but again, you must climb on board) is our heroine because she volunteers to take her little sister's place when her name is drawn. And that's really all I want to tell you. Except there is suspense, violence, unrequited love, drama, rebellion, and weird futuristic scenarios that are oddly fascinating. Like to the point where you try to fall asleep but CAN'T because all you want to know is what will happen next?!
Well if those are American values you believe in then to reclaim it I guess we know that you, Barry, are going to be getting a pink slip come November as you are antithetically opposed to anything I can even think of an American value.

I both love and hate this table. Love it 'cause it fits lots of people around it. Hate it 'cause it is too big for general family life, invites stuff to get dumped on it and blocks off too much of the usable space.

Way back years ago when we were at Sauk Rapids Alliance Church (which is now Bridge Community Church) and Troy Bondy was the youth pastor (we love Troy and Deana), we used to sing a song by Bob Gillman. I sing it even now:
Shirley was my youngest son; the boy.
When we expect a man apart from Christ to live according to Christ, we fail to remember that apart from Christ a man can do nothing … repeat … nothing (John 15:5).
Grace and justice are perfectly compatible because justice is not law or legalism, nor is it about punishment or eternal torture. Justice is setting people free from the law and from condemnation. That’s true justice.

Everybody lies, though often it's not on purpose. Denial - for instance - is dishonesty that protects the denier. At some point, in some situations, we "break" denial. Some call those moments revelation, epiphany. Sometimes the shock of a brand new truth is very unpleasant. The way individuals deal with denial and its breakage says so much about their characters.

Chronicles of Wasted Time was originally two separate volumes. The Green Stick documents Muggeridge’s early life and his journey out from the illusion of socialism. For a variety of reasons it is the stronger half of the book; Muggeridge inhabits a literary world there are many figures with whom the reader will be familiar (D.H. Lawrence, George Orwell, and others). Furthermore it has a special cohesion because it is the self-contained story of Muggeridge’s ideological journey. The second volume, The Infernal Grove, covers Muggeridge’s war years, but lacks the cohesion of the first volume and is, on the whole, a darker book. A third volume was planned but left unfinished, and might have framed the second volume differently (as the third act gives redemption to the dark second act in a play). Consequently, The Infernal Grove lacks some of the depth and energy of The Green Stick.

The Sultan said Malaysia was not like some countries, where there were no democratic avenues, including elections, and that it was wrong for any Malaysian to emulate the protests there.
So, Tania. She’s investigating the footage she has of Nikki’s accident, rather than following up on who has had Full Body Replacement. She goes back out to Staging (the cargo bay) to see if she can intuit anything more. On her way back she is stopped by Steve, and we get into that whole story instead of meeting Shatner Posey, whom I haven’t found a way to introduce now that the investigation has changed.
This series indeed started on a very slow pace for me. But I really learned to love how it started to build up as each episode progress and that same love helped me to disregard whatever bad side this series had. I think, Episode 3 was the turning point for me. I’ve never laughed and enjoyed any PT episode as much as Episode 3! It cracked me up big time and everything went uphill from there. But I may just add, I slipped down that hill in Episode 16. I love Lee Min Ho, so all the flaws can just go down with me!

When Jesus addressed His disciples, He instructed each of them that they must “deny himself, take up his cross daily and follow me.” Jesus’ message is clear to us all, in order to follow Him, we must have the same attitude toward life and death that He had. Each one us must deny ourselves, that is, not think selfishly about ourselves, but look out for and towards others. You must be prepared to take up your cross daily, that is, you must have total and daily commitment in order to survive the path of rejection that comes with following Jesus.

There has been years of ongoing dispute as to whether the teachers and school system are primarily responsible for the care of a child or whether that sole responsibility lies in the hands of the child’s parents. I have always believed that it takes a village to raise a child so in this bill; you will see that the responsibility will lie at the breastplate of all parties involved.
When Murrow saw the cat carrier, she bolted under the sofa and I threatened to sell her to the local Chinese restaurant. An open can of StarKist and my tender, compassionate voice helped coax her into the carrier, and we were off.

With that ramble out of the way, another fantastic thing Bar Magazine has going for it is how accessible it is through itunes Newstand, after downloading the app it cost a mere $1.99 and within seconds I was flicking through its pages. Unfortunately I am still waiting for my other favourite Bar Publication, Australian Bartender Magazine, to arrive on my doorstep and I ordered that puppy over a month ago!
I'd e-mailed the full draft to my advisor last week, as instructed. She wrote me a harried reply late Sunday night to say she'd only started reading it that day, was halfway through, and was exhausted. (She's teaching an overload and is on seven other thesis committees, she said, as she's said numerous times this semester.) She'd been writing directly on the hard copy she'd printed off. Could I give her my address so she could mail it to me, two-day air? Just the first six chapters. On the seventh, she'd had nothing to suggest.
Sometimes I think we spend half our lives like Chuck in that scene, tugging on the end of the rope, not quite sure whether we are going to give up the raft, or give up the volleyball. Chuck’s problem was that after four years alone, part of him actually believed that Wilson was a real person. He wasn’t sure of the truth. He may not have been fully convinced that the raft would really bring him back to civilization and real people. Because of his experience, Wilson seemed more real, more important than the raft.
True, the reviews were by and large condescending, but when were they not for such an enterprise? And the mockery, albeit of a good-natured sort, even extended to the Raven household itself, as Mandy recalls: “Crucible was very much laughed at by the children - he had six, by the way - for the way in which it resembled our actual home life, especially when he banged the dining room table!”

Existing case law of the EPO takes a very broad view of public disclosure. If the relevant information is accessible it is generally deemed to be publically disclosed, irrespective of whether or not anyone has actually accessed the information. Thus all the books in a library would be considered as being publically disclosed (T381/87). However the EPO has also decided that an uncatalogued document in a library, whose existence was not known, was not public (T314/99). G1/92 held that the composition of a product is disclosed if the product is publically available, irrespective of whether or not there is a motivation to ascertain its composition. Thus according to G1/92 there should be no element of subjectivity in determining what is disclosed, it only being dependent on whether the means for analysis is available. G1/92 also considered undue burden as part of the test for whether something was disclosed.
Suddenly and without warning, the first scout was dragged under the water. Steely hands and sinewy arms slithered around him like the death grip of a giant constrictor snake. He fought and struggled to get his head above water … to catch a breath … to fill his lungs with air … to fight. The swamp-dweller drug the Chinese scout to the bottom like a gator drowning a deer. Once they reached the bottom of the shallow swamp, the American’s weight shifted, his legs wrapped around the U.N. soldier like a wrestler going for a submission and then the scout’s neck snapped. His body went limp as the life and fight drained into the pungent waters of the swamp.
An area of grass is subject to the laws of perspective like any surface of land. Arial perspective means that grass in the background will appear as masses of a lighter tone with a blue bias. Foreground can be painted with stronger colours and with more details, although there is no need to paint every single blade of grass. It is much better to only detail some areas and let the viewers’ brain fill the gaps elsewhere.

Ignorant of that reality we can imagine just about anything--even mining camps on the Moon with ore-carrying shuttles. But the decline of fossil fuels--which have up until now allowed us to harbor such daydreams--may soon shock us back to reality and return us to the urgent task of organizing a society that runs on less, not more energy.

14. Give up attachment. This is a concept that, for most of us is so hard to grasp and I have to tell you that it was for me too, (it still is) but it’s not something impossible. You get better and better at with time and practice. The moment you detach yourself from all things, (and that doesn’t mean you give up your love for them – because love and attachment have nothing to do with one another, attachment comes from a place of fear, while love… well, real love is pure, kind, and self less, where there is love there can’t be fear, and because of that, attachment and love cannot coexist) you become so peaceful, so tolerant, so kind, and so serene. You will get to a place where you will be able to understand all things without even trying. A state beyond words.

In my line of work one gets lots of exposure to South African government officials, academics, and stakeholders; which are typical ruling class individuals. Despite it I am pretty upbeat about politics, in general. Conservative Americans with their insatiable desire for independence from government are giving us a good example to follow. Access to their philosophy with its challenges is possible for South Africans, thanks to the internet and no thanks to the mainstream media. But sadly, conservative America will not continue to exist as we know it and that’s all the more reason to get to know it now before it’s no longer accessible.

Look, if you will, at the level of contempt in which they hold us, the Warrant Card-less. Many seem to think that Mace and Tasers are too good for the likes of us and that they should carry guns. I'm jiggy with that, but only if I can carry a gun as well. At the rate of degradation in the police force I reckon I would spend more time defending myself from them as I would the criminal fraternity....
I’m a visual person first, and a control freak second! If I see something (animal, vegetable, mineral) that clearly needs a tweak, I want to make it better. As a hairdresser in NYC, my gift was my ability to really see other people, and I think that I was successful because I saw beauty where maybe the client didn’t. Holding up that mirror for them and showing them their own possibilities was totally empowering and addictive. Interior design is much the same in that it’s a passion of mine, something that I’d practiced on the side for years, and it’s about really seeing the space, and bringing out what I think is it’s best incarnation.
Then he would comprehend more of the big picture, for God was already in Rome ordering his steps when he would arrive. God was inGalatia, that land off to the north, caring for the believers, those near and dear to Paul. He certainly could no longer minister unto them as the apostle of the Gentiles but he could intercede for them and God could do that ministering spiritually.

Brent Dowe - Down Here In Babylon
I sometimes undertake the thankless, frustrating and somewhat pointless task of trying to convince German colleagues that there is such a thing as non-German beer. The level of banality of responses I get is beyond belief. Last year at a work barbeque I took along what I thought was an extremely safe bet (as I recall a Hobgoblin, a London Pride, a Honeydew and an ESB). One cretin opined "there must be lots of chemicals in it, it tastes strange"... this was a Hobgoblin mind, not a Geuze mixed with fermented ferret sweat. I tried explaining about top fermented yeast and the like, although it would have been an equally productive use of my time explaining quantum theory to a piece of cheese.

After McIlroy posted 16-under in the US Open last year at Congressional, he expects the USGA to tighten things up at the Olympic Club in San Francisco for this year’s Open in June. Bet on it.
