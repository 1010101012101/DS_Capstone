Coen brings the right combination of courtroom expertise, integrity and calm demeanor. He is a Los Angeles deputy district attorney, as are many candidates, and it's no surprise. Prosecuting criminal cases provides rigorous training in the law and courtroom procedure, but more to the point, it puts lawyers in a position to observe and learn from the best and worst judges, and the best and worst attorneys, on a daily basis. It also puts those judges and attorneys in a position to observe the candidate and to assess whether he or she would do a good job on the bench — and judges and lawyers who have worked with or against Coen give him high marks.

With small, sharp scissors, cut through the knuckle shells, pry open and pull out the meat. Wrap the rest of the meat in plastic and refrigerate. You may cut up the lobster shells, and save for stock, or discard.

Every person in higher education has a moral responsibility and expectation to protect the young men and women we interact with on a daily basis.

They failed in properly investigating the claims brought before them and allowed a sexual predator repeated access to a venue to commit disgusting crimes on the most precious resource we can as human beings can create, our children.
That would both improve existing train service and make the rails fit for high-speed trains when they arrive. It also serves another purpose: The better commuter train service becomes, the more Californians will get used to riding the rails routinely. That's important because the more accustomed people are to using trains, the more likely they will be to ride bullet trains around the state if and when the service starts. That's vital to future bullet train financing, which has rested from the start on a presumption that once California's $9.9 billion in bonds, plus some billions more in federal aid, are spent, private investors will move in. They won't until and unless they're convinced ridership will actually reach the optimistic levels often predicted by the rail authority.

Maryland, California and Oklahoma are the only states where the governor has the final say in parole decisions. Elsewhere, the parole commission's decision goes.

Notable: LSU is 7-0 for the second straight season and seeks to go 8-0 for the first time since 1973. Auburn is 5-2. LSU will try to keep pace with No. 2 Alabama in the Southeastern Conference Western Division race but will have to do so without three players suspended for violating the team's drug policy: star CB Tyrann Mathieu, leading rusher Spencer Ware and nickel defensive back Tharold Simon. Mathieu and Simon have combined for 71 tackles and three interceptions this season. If LSU survives, next up is a Nov. 5 showdown of No. 1 vs. No. 2 at Alabama.
Annan’s mission looks like a repeat of the bad movie he starred in with regard to Iraq in 2003, when he tried to “bring both sides together” with a trip to Baghdad. At that time, the “both sides” were Saddam Hussein and the UN Security Council. Annan’s magic formula? A plan to send a team of “black-tie observers” to conduct a polite inspection of Iraqi presidential palaces.
Dallas, meanwhile, could be very short-handed. Point guard Delonte West, who has been starting in place of injured Jason Kidd, turned an ankle during the morning shootaround, and his status remained uncertain.

When Cullen works with a client, "our plant list initially has any whimsical idea that somebody has," he says. " 'I've always liked this plant and that.' Put them all on the list. Then we try to edit them so they can be married together properly. We may have a list, for example, of four dozen perennials. By the time we're done, we're down to eight specific plants that are left. And maybe some of them are ancillary."

Surely, the Jason Kidd era and back-to-back NBA Finals appearances will stir up some great Nets memories with plenty of classic playoff games to choose from during those years. Speaking of Kidd's teams, maybe one of your top memories was Rod Thorn's trade of Stephon Marbury to get Jason Kidd and the draft-day blockbuster that nabbed Richard Jefferson. Those turned the Nets into a championship-caliber franchise.

The Bush administration had to deal with the same problems in Iraq - while being blamed for terrorists' misdeeds. In addition, Bush had to navigate around Democrats who impugned not only the morality of a war of choice but also the morality of military tactics and the cost of the war. Obama frequently denounced the $10 billion per month cost of the Iraq war.

The final question: What religion am I, and how often do I go to church? My answers are unorthodox there, too, but I refrained from an explanation. Indiana is a startlingly conservative state — the Indianapolis News still prints a daily prayer — so I imagine that politics and religion crawl into bed together practically every night. I didn’t want to get into it.
Beastie Boy Mike D's Transmission LA: AV exhibition and festival at MOCA's Geffen Contemporary has been getting tons of buzz both for its vibrant art and for its music offerings (opening night with Santigold, last week's DJ set by Thom Yorke).

In retrospect, it was a historic combination: A player on his way to the Hall of Fame and an executive who should join him there. But Holland was like you and me. He didn't see it. His scouting report: Good player. Needs to get stronger.
A legitimate debate about cyclists and rules of the road seems to be heading where many Florida debates go — off the cliff of reason and into the sea of insanity.
But Bochy sent a veiled message in a meeting earlier this weekend, telling the players to bring only the clothes on their backs Sunday. Sure enough, the charter jet kept its tires on the tarmac, and the Giants have three days to prepare for their first postseason series since 2003.
If you feel like you might be in a clothing vs. body situation and don't know where to begin making changes, try going drastic. If you've been wearing nothing but skirts for 10 years, try pants. Skinny pants, wide legged pants, flares, straight legs, any pants. If you've been doing loads of layers, pare down to a single layer of garments for a while. If you've been wearing low rise bottoms, try high waisted ones instead. Whatever you're doing now, try the opposite. You'll probably end up meandering back to a middle ground eventually, but starting out extreme will allow you to explore the gamut.

Holiday is one of the few guards who can come close to matching Rose's quickness. And with Rose playing more of a floor game of late, Holiday might try to keep him on the perimeter. Like many 76ers defenders, he likes to roam passing lanes for steals. Rose vows he still can take over games if needed despite battling five injuries this season and missing 27 games. He has earned the benefit of the doubt. Edge: Bulls.

Collins believes those figures prove that with this option, some inmates on death row likely would be serving life without parole instead. He also said life in prison allows the state to correct the low percentage mistake of wrongful incarceration.
"It was crazy at that time," Fortgang says. "A basic thing in restaurants is position numbers. Every seat in a restaurant has a number so you can give people what they ordered. When I got there, servers would walk up to a table and say, 'Who's got the chicken?'"

Good break: You never know when you are going to most need or want the bye week but on paper, the Ravens’ Oct. 28 off week sets up perfectly. It’s nearly at the midpoint of the season and it comes on the heels of what figures to be a physical contest against the Houston Texans at Reliant Stadium.

Morton couldn't get his trademark sinker to sink and the Reds took full advantage. Frazier drilled a shot into the bleachers in the second for his first home run since Sept. 2, and Stubbs pushed Cincinnati's lead to 4-0 in the fourth when his fly ball sailed just over the wall in right-center.
There were some rumblings before the draft that the Ravens actually were much higher on Wisconsin guard Kevin Zeitler than his college teammate, Konz. That was confirmed yesterday. The Ravens really liked Zeitler. They loved his durability, his toughness and his mean streak. As they like to say at The Castle, Zeitler “plays like a Raven.” He ultimately was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals two picks before the Ravens were initially on the clock. The more I think about it, I bet the Ravens would have stayed where they were and made the pick had Zeitler been on the board.

It's a timely topic in light of Arizona State's search for a football coach. Does it pursue a big name? A promising coordinator? Does it extend its search nationally or look within? It's a decision that will define director of athletics Lisa Love's tenure and determine whether the Sun Devils can rises from the ashes of football mediocrity.
So off they go, gunning the accelerator. Again, how does this happen? Five weeks after it seemed they were headed for the NFC East dumpster, after losing for the second time to the last-place Washington Redskins? Maybe they were inspired by the jowly foghorn from Florham Park, or maybe the team ahead of them in the standings decided it didn’t want to play anymore when its quarterback suffered a hand injury. Or maybe they just started to share the coach’s faith, judging by the way they smashed their next four opponents by an average count of 30-12.

According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the total cost for renovating Baltimore schools is an estimated $2.8 billion. According to this editorial, the proposal to increase the existing container tax to 5 cents on soft drinks, iced teas, energy drinks, juice, beer and bottled water would generate an estimated $10 million per year. Under this plan, revenue collected from the beverage container tax would be pooled with future revenue from the yet-to-be-built slots parlor and $12 million from other school money that would allegedly enable the city to raise $300 million in the bond market.
The game spotlighted a rookie class that has been derided for its lack of quality and depth. Cavaliers rookie forward Tristan Thompson played his best game and recorded his first double-double, logging 15 points and 12 rebounds.

Established in 1927, Glen Aulin is one of the park's older camps. In 1916, Stephen Mather, the first director of the National Park Service, proposed a network of rustic mountain retreats that would entice park-goers into Yosemite's majestic back country. Today, some of the camps are showing their age. Iron bed springs sag and whine. There are drafty holes in tent skirts. But the hearty meals and enthusiastic service by the camps' young staffers more than compensate for the slightly careworn accommodations. Awaiting us at Glen Aulin were a cake and a cooler of lemonade. Dinner was turkey and dressing; breakfast the next morning was oatmeal, eggs and pancakes. Vegetarian meals were available at all the camps for those who had requested them in advance.

The honest way to bridge the $9.6 billion shortfall would be with addition (revenue increases) and subtraction (spending cuts). The responsible way, as Gov. Jerry Brown has suggested, would be with a combination of the two.

Mr. Palfrey: Google should be able to avail itself of the DMCA's broad safe harbor for copyright infringement under U.S. law. Whether or not Google makes money on the content is not, and should not be, the issue at stake here. The issue is whether or not Google takes its job seriously in responding to genuine demands to take down copyrighted materials from the YouTube service. To date, YouTube has been a model citizen in this regard: they've gone out of their way to license content from big content owners, they've been working on fingerprinting solutions to help content owners track their copyrighted materials, and they've sought to make it easy, expedited process for submitting a complaint about copyright violations. They've even made room for Diddy to have a channel, to which the artist has uploaded BadBoyRecords material to YouTube. Google needs to be accountable to copyright holders. If they are, they should be in the clear for the YouTube service. It's about creating an accountable Internet.

A: That's probably what Carmelo wants. Actually, I think it becomes closer to what the Heat faced when the Knicks visited AmericanAirlines Arena on Jan. 27 and launched 43 3-pointers, making 18. I think they will try to space the floor for Anthony to attack, reducing the Heat's ability to bring help, and when the Heat do double-team, lock and launch from the perimeter. Steve Novak and J.R. Smith may have wrist issues when Game 3 is over. Of course, Mike Woodson has been doing everything possible to distance himself from the Mike D'Antoni approach, so perhaps not.

But comparing the bottom line from one year to the next is an inadequate way to analyze the wisdom of the spending plan Maryland was left with when the legislative session was gaveled to a close.
