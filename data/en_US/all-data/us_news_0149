Without question, collective bargaining takes the biggest hit in the reorganization being proposed, and some of the provisions may go too far. But the general direction is about restoring a balance between workers' interests and the rights of taxpayers in the city. By some measures, Detroit's fixed costs (which include the city's massive pension and retiree health care liabilities) eat up between 35 and 42 cents of every dollar the city has, which means the city spends between a third and a half of its money before it puts a single cop on the streets, turns on a single light or sends a bus down Woodward Avenue.

Love is both bliss and panacea, while politics is a test of fortitude, on India.Arie's fourth studio album. One of the most determinedly virtuous songwriters in R&B or pop, India.Arie strives to make faith, goodness and positive thinking seductive. "Testimony: Vol. 1: Love & Relationship," released in 2006, delved into the pain of a breakup, but on most of "Vol. 2," her equanimity has been restored. There's a limit to how many self-help platitudes a song can bear, and it's certainly exceeded at times here. But with a brisk, pulsating track and boundless anticipation in her voice, India.Arie comes close to making the truisms ring true.

-- As for the other personal-foul penalties for hits on receivers, that's textbook "defenseless" and exactly what the NFL is trying to eliminate. I'm not sure why the home crowd was so upset with the one on S Isa Abdul-Quddus. Per the rule changes of the past few years, that's a blatant penalty.

That is not to say that the city should leave its election alone. Holding separate balloting is a significant waste of money — it costs Baltimore about $3.7 million — and this week's election is a significant outlier. The Democratic presidential primary was uncontested, and the Democratic primaries for U.S. Senate and House of Representatives were only barely so. The only race of real significance on the ballot was the Republican presidential primary, and there are so few registered Republicans in Baltimore that they are a mere blip in the turnout statistics. (Curiously, Republican turnout in the city was even lower than the overall figure at a little less than 13 percent.)

To secure accurate boundaries, the Scouts were willing to invest resources to survey the entire valley. The Scouts retained BHA Inc., a reputable San Diego surveying business, which prepared multiple surveys to determine boundaries in the area. In 2008, in a case involving the Scouts, the Baldwins and other residents in the valley, Superior Court Judge Jacqueline M. Stern found the BHA surveys to be correct as to the relevant boundaries, and judgment was entered in favor of the Scouts and recorded. Others in the valley were represented in that case by legal counsel and had retained their own surveyor. There was no appeal from that judgment and so the true boundaries are legally established. They clearly demonstrate that the land the Baldwins own is some distance from the place the Baldwins call home, as they had been told from the outset. The cabin, the trailer and all the other outbuildings are on land the Baldwins never owned, and are entirely on land the Scouts own.

He authored dozens of books, lobbied the White House for everything from faith-based prisoner rehabilitation programs to more funding for international AIDS relief, and launched a syndicated column and radio show that made him a leading commentator on the day's hot-button issues.

The issue has to do with more than just "Samantha Who's" ability to stand on its own.

Then everything blew up. Huge. Smith and those first outings at the Get Me High Lounge in Wicker Park and later at the Green Mill in Uptown made a lot happen for poetry/spoken word. They built audiences, interest, personalities, and turned the spotlight on a scene that became scenes — many scenes. Some thought that TV stuff, with people shouting into microphones on shows such as "Def Poetry Jam," wasn't the way. Others were just happy that poetry, in whatever form it took, had an audience.

No, it wasn’t a storm cloud, or a howler monkey, or any one of the enormous insects that make their home in Nicaragua. It was Cerro Negro (translation: Black Hill), a 2,214-foot-tall volcano made up of nothing but charcoal-colored rock and ash, without so much as a weed sprouting from its moonscape-like surface.

The catalyst was the impending 2009 government-mandated switchover from analog to digital TV.

These conflicts are not all that make "Footnote" so stimulating. The inventive, playfully cinematic ways Cedar presents the drama — like using unspooling microfilm as a recurring visual theme — are essential in keeping us involved.
"Mickey Lolich is a grown man, he was near the end of his career and he didn't fit into our picture, " Campbell said. "Jim Northrup was traded; Willie Horton was traded.

Hank Greenberg was traded. Hal Newhouser was traded. It's part of the game."

Schundler continued to push unions to agree to a one-year wage freeze, saying it could help offset any layoffs in most districts. Mentioning last week’s rejection of 58 percent of school budgets, Schundler warned lawmakers they should be wary of raising taxes or risk being thrown out of office.
In an email, Mogerman, a portrait artist, described Gingrich as bold, decisive and a "clear thinker. His idea of a moon colony is not a 'looney' idea any more than John Kennedy's idea in 1961 that we would reach the moon by the end of that decade was a looney idea."

Happy birhtday: It's Christine's sweet 16. More than 300 people are expected to attend, including Danielle's ex, Tom, and his new wife. The guests start to arrive and walk the red carpet. Danielle says it's a benefit (though we never hear where the money Christine "earns" is going to), and Danielle got everything donated. Kim G. is there, and Tom Staub shows up with his new wife. There's a nice little reunion. Christine makes her entrance, bizarrely enough, on the shoulders of a professional bodybuilder. Jillian makes her singing debut. No comment. A good time is had by all.

On taxes, Obama is also expected to call for economic fairness encapsulated by the so-called "Buffett Rule," arguing that the wealthy shouldn't pay a smaller share of their income in federal taxes than middle-class taxpayers. Many wealthy taxpayers earn investment income, which is taxed at 15 percent, and Obama has proposed that people earning at least $1 million annually -- whether in salary or investments -- should pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes.
1. The Lakers need a psychological pick-me-up. A victory over the Western Conference's worst team won't solve the Lakers' problems. They're just coming off a week that wasn't much fun for the purple and gold. The Lakers' loss Sunday to Memphis included the team getting outworked and the Kobe Bryant benching controversy. They topped that off with a middling road win against Golden State that featured Andrew Bynum getting benched for taking an ill-advised three-pointer. Then the team got an eye-opening reminder that they can't contend with the West-leading Oklahoma City Thunder. Beating New Orleans wouldn't erase any of that, especially when the Hornets are fielding an injury-depleted lineup of Trevor Ariza (ankle), Gustavo Ayon, Jarrett Jack (ankle), Chris Kaman (illness), Eric Gordon (knee) and Emeka Okafor (knee). But at least a quality performance could put the Lakers in better spirits.

The dog died when its head was caught in a trap set at the edge of a pond in the McCurtains' residential neighborhood. The Cedar Lake Neighborhood Association, of which the McCurtains are members, paid Wildlife Services to kill nutria -- large, non-native rodents that frequent wetlands and can damage trees and bushes. The pond is part of the association's common area. Nutria had damaged the banks of the pond, and worse problems ahead were a concern, Williams says.

The Los Angeles riots happened because justice did not.

Already I've heard some grumbling about the prices and the fact there is cheaper Indian food a few doors down on Fillmore, but that's a naive argument. The products are meticulously sourced, and the interior and service has been elevated. The criticism, however, does have a little more credence on a few items, particularly the Samosas, North and South. The plate has some undressed greens, a dipping sauce and two small pastries for $8 - a triangular packet filled with vegetables and caramelized onions, and a plumper rounded version filled with spiced potatoes.
La Costa Resort: A classic resort with Spanish-style architecture. A big draw is Splash Landing, a great water-park style swimming pool (one of six on the grounds), whose biggest slide emerges from what looks like a Mission-era bell tower. Lots of golf and tennis.

For instance, every self-respecting drug store had a soda fountain. Whenever I could catch a dime from my dad, I would go to Petti's Pharmacy at Juaniata and Oakhill for a milk shake. I think he lost money on me. He had to put in ice cream, milk and flavoring and he threw in a couple of cookies. It must have been a loser for him. Maybe that is why drugstores dropped soda fountains. They were too much trouble and did not make any money.
Birnbaum treats the romaine salad ($10) like the classic iceberg wedge. The head is quartered and topped with croutons and a bold anchovy dressing that's been pounded in a mortar and pestle to enhance its flavor and texture. The warm spinach salad ($13) is equality audacious, with bacon and pickled onions and a poached duck egg nestled in the greens; unfortunately, the egg was about 2 degrees from being hard boiled, so there was no runny yolk to meld, tame and enrich the combination.
