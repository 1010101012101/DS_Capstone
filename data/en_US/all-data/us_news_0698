Doraty doesn't want an exemption from the zoning law. He wants to change the law to reflect what he believes are the needs and reality of the community's commercial interests. With the support of some officials, Doraty hired a lawyer in 2009 to draft new zoning laws that he believed would be supported. But his quest deflated after a township trustee who backed his plan died and another sympathetic official lost re-election.

Nevertheless, Muni is taking no chances.
From what I can tell, the more money you make available for kids to go to college, the more that colleges will charge. That is, if it costs $5,000 per semester and the feds come up with $4,000 in loans and grants, it doesn't mean the student will need to pay only $1,000 per semester. It generally means the college will jack up its costs to $9,000 per semester.
All I know is we came to Mitt Romneys home state, got outspent by millions and millions of dollars, and at least according to the polls, its very competitive, John Brubaker, a senior strategist for Santorum, said from the Amway Grand Hotel in Grand Rapids, where the campaign was holding its election night party.

The mushroom clouds from the atmospheric tests were visible in Las Vegas, 65 miles to the southeast. Protesters were regular visitors at the site. "In those days, we could agree to disagree," McClain said. "Three o'clock on Good Friday, every year, they would line up to be arrested. When they were bailed out, they would come to my house. We had a big open house every Easter."
Understandably disheartened about his contest prospects, Pirate Captain throws himself into his work with renewed vigor but hits a streak of bad luck that gets worse when he captures a young scientist named Charles Darwin (David Tennant). Yes, that Charles Darwin.
Almost by accident, Panther discovers, via assorted Boneyites (ice-queen teacher Jem Jewel; wanderlusting Pearl Peach; her ex, Dieball player Billy Borg), that the weed puts users into telepathic alignment. The book is full of broken mirrors, and the herb triggers levels of reflection that get vertiginous: "Pearl sees how Paul sees Pearl sees Paul." Sometimes the results are blissful; mostly they're extremely freaky, even disturbingly raw, and Shaw pulls out all the stops to show such complex altered states in a manner both intuitive and chaotic. Graphics and text overlap, the timeframes and layers of meaning there to be teased out; in this haze, bits of one body get transferred to another, and it's tantalizingly unclear whose thoughts are being articulated. Most graphic novels are easily consumed at a gallop, but these sequences slow down the speed of "Bodyworld," making for a rich experience (or should that be an irony-free synaesthetic experience?) that can't be achieved through words alone.
Citing that review, city officials declined to comment. The McMahons and their lawyers also declined to comment.
Before the season started, Whitehead and Ozerities committed to UCF and Heggie seemed to be a natural to follow. But then he got hurt. An aggravating a groin injury caused him to miss his first three games.

This season offers four plays by the Bard, including "Much Ado about Nothing" and "Henry V." Another, called "MacHomer," is a retelling of "Macbeth" with characters from "The Simpsons."
But this female-skewing drama gets points for its actors' performances and its originality, from the voyeuristic way it's shot to the subject matter that focuses on a more unconventional profession than your typical cop/doctor/lawyer show - not to mention the casting of a black woman in the lead role.
The law also has reignited interest in the issue: 10 percent of all Americans named immigration as the nation's most important problem in a Gallup survey released Wednesday - the highest Gallup has recorded in more than two years.

"The concern has been we've haven't had a full tournament with automatic qualifiers for all the existing conferences. That's a big part of making sure everybody has an opportunity for their champion to participate," said Appalachian State athletic director Charlie Cobb, the new chairman of the Division I Football Championship Committee.

I couldn’t get enough of Dlugoss’ Asian beef short ribs ($21). They are comfort food with an exotic flair, if that’s not a complete contradiction in terms. Two very large, falling-apart-tender short ribs are bathed in a savory, soy-inflected ginger-hoisin reduction, served alongside the most fabulous jasmine rice, fragrant and almost creamy. Steamed whole baby bok choy adds color and crunch, balancing the plate perfectly.

LIPITOR LOWER: In the first full quarter since blockbuster cholesterol pill Lipitor lost U.S. patent protection, its sales fell 71 percent in the U.S. and 42 percent worldwide, to $1.4 billion. But big discounts to insurers and patients helped retain a third of the market, far more than usual.

Gresham has a sure hand with pasta, and for this course, she creates ravioli with tomato and red chile pasta filled with Asiago and ricotta, tossed with dry mountain-aged Gorgonzola.

Johnathan Rickman, 17, weighed 330 pounds and stood nearly a foot taller than Leonard when he pummeled the boy and threw him to the ground. Leonard grabbed a kitchen knife and chased him out the door and into the street, where he stabbed him once. Rickman died a few minutes later.

Most noteworthy was bass Matt Boehler, as Don Giovanni’s beleaguered servant Leporello. The role could not have been cast better. As much an actor as a singer, Boehler’s comic skills were put to use especially well in the aria “Madamina, il catalogo e questo” — in which he shares Giovanni’s little black book with another victim, Donna Elvira.
The aim of "Bikes!" is to encourage visitors to enjoy that bounty and connect with nature.
My event was at 8 p.m. Luckily, Rent The Runway can hand-deliver in New York City. I didn't wear the Siriano, as both sizes were too tight. But the Missoni dress, which sells for $1,900, left me thinking about buying one for keeps. What's more, each dress was clean and indistinguishable from a brand-new frock.

But in the end, this night was more a celebration of a grand music career than a farewell or a living memorial. The crowd took over Rhinestone Cowboy, roaring its chorus back at Campbell, surprising him, it seemed. Likewise, Southern Nights never sounded brighter or livelier. He ended with A Better Place, a lovely hymn about seeing the big picture, the grand perspective: I need the ones I love, Lord / Each and every day. Thursday night, he was surrounded by them, and it made for an extraordinary show that most of us will long remember.
A: Absolutely. And I did all that injured. I had three severe injuries I was playing with last year. But I was just so hungry and upset at the way I was being perceived, I was going to go out there and play on anything.
The idea that parents have nothing better to do than to elect members to the school board who would "introduce many unnecessary frills" to the school budget is insulting. Is asking for relief for overcrowding, so that all children have a seat in their classrooms and are not taught in the hall or in closets, and climate control, so that teachers and children are not ill and collapsing in hot classrooms, "frilly?"
A look at the events today around the Colorado State spring football game at Hughes Stadium:
His first flight was canceled. The second flight went fine, but on his third one, a two-hour layover to refuel turned into an eight-hour delay.

Howard suggested that building the plants in Troutdale would eliminate the need for PGE's transmission upgrade north of Portland, and might even reduce the need for PGE's $1 billion cross-Cascades line.

It didn't help that Ellis was his spectacular self, seemingly waiting to shine in front of a national TV audience. Ellis had 39 points, 24 of them in the first half, while adding seven assists and two steals. He scored every way imaginable, and often with great improvision and style.

Arizona's incoming legislative leadership, on the other hand, promises to begin the new year by pushing a law challenging the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of birthright citizenship.

The bicultural nature of the company lets us ensure that we have a good understanding of the way the two countries work. Canadians tend to like less chaotic, more regulated society. Americans tend to like a little more laissez-faire, get it done, rough and tumble attitude. Both of those work and when the two come together, it is a pretty powerful result.
When I launched the Realist Idealist column, the idea was to look at environmentally promising home improvement projects through the eyes of a budget-minded consumer. I had seen so much media coverage that heaped praise on newly constructed eco-manses or expensive retrofit products, but the stories didn't answer my biggest question: For the green-minded person writing the checks, are the improvements worth the time, effort and expense?

Someone like Santorum may see no troublesome contradiction here. Of course Bell was embraced by the Eastern, Ivy League, blah blah blah media establishment. The outrageous passages that can be plucked selectively and misinterpreted from his books don't contradict this; they prove it. That establishment is as dangerously left-wing and un-American as Bell was, and so is Obama. Even Gingrich probably holds a more nuanced view of the American political landscape, and Romney may sense that a general attack on the establishment is going to be a tough case for him to make.

"The Financier" centers on Frank Algernon Cowperwood, whom the author repeatedly describes as possessing "force." Cowperwood proves himself both skilled and resilient in the financial marketplace. He also keeps a cool head when he's discovered sleeping with his business partner's daughter. Mr. Dreiser so insistently interleaves stock-market intrigue with sex, in fact, that one critic described Cowperwood's story as a club sandwich of "slices of business alternating with erotic episodes."

"Each episode will focus on a single ingredient," Lamar explained. "We will be visiting several gardens and farms. We will also be working with a variety of chefs to learn how to best prepare each ingredient." "We must restore our connection to our food," Lamar continued. "Real food is thoughtful. Without chemical additives and preservatives, unused food can spoil quickly. Changing eating habits requires basic life style changes, putting more thought into what we eat. Diets, preaching, and shocking statistics — such as obesity drains $150B from our annual health care costs and life expectancy is dropping — raise awareness, but they don't solve the underlying behavioral issues. We must shift our priorities from instant gratification to health and happiness." To share stories which touch down in our own incredible food area, an area loaded with farms, gardens, chefs, wine country, foodies, Lamar has assembled an award-winning team to create and share these stories.

Art Tatum: After I returned home from being a foot soldier in World War II, I was fortunate enough to be able to study under the GI Bill of Rights. One teacher in particular told me to not to imitate other singers so I would just sound like "another part of the chorus" but to find jazz instrumental artists I admired and try to understand what I liked about their style. I always loved the jazz pianist Art Tatum, who would build his performance — he would move in and out of the melody — and it would create a very interesting presentation. At the time all the singers — Sinatra, Dick Haymes — would sing what I call a "sweet, straight line," so I established a style where I would change my phrasing or end with a big finish to a song and I was able to create my own style.

With these as priorities we will build our business model with a clear view of our competitive environment and our own financial circumstances.

Dear Margo: I just found out that my wife of 32 years has been playing me for a fool all this time. It started when we were dating. On rare occasions, my girlfriend (now wife) would initiate sex and insisted we didn't need protection. I didn't complain, maybe because she had a very low sex drive. This began in college and continued after we married up until she had her tubes tied after the birth of our third child. This would happen every six months during school and every year after we were married. Now, 32 years later, I find out that the motivation for her increased libido was that she would have unprotected sex with some other guy and wanted to ensure that if she was pregnant I would think it was mine. On top of that, one of our kids was conceived right after one of her "lapses," and everyone, including his brothers, knows I'm not the father. It's time to file for divorce. The other kids are all adults. What do I tell them? You can bet I'm going to tell her sisters and everyone she knows, if only because she has always acted like Little Miss Perfect. I feel like such a fool. Why did I marry this woman? — Burned Up

I probably shouldn’t admit this, and it’s probably not the most professional thing in the world to do as a film critic…but I left when the movie still had another 45 minutes to go. I really just stopped caring about the outcome and figured I woldn’t waste any more of my time.

The way smart grid works is that the system takes several snapshots a minute of the amount of power being used in a home at any given time.

The Giants don’t have a Graham. They barely have Jake Ballard at this point. But they do have a very good slot presence in WR Victor Cruz. Much as CB Carlos Rogers did the salsa after his interception, I thought Cruz did a fine job that day, especially in his releases off the line. If the Niners play man coverage, they’d better do it in spurts because if Cruz gets enough chances, he’ll beat Rogers again. I’m wondering if the Niners throw more zone coverage at the Giants than they expect right now.

She also uncovers the real motives behind Prime Destinations in a fast-paced, high-stakes narrative in which few characters are what they seem.
Where there is a consensus is on those vintages worst affected. Most experts agree that 1996, 1999 and 2002 were particularly prone to premature oxidation.

"There have been years that have had more intensive damage in a particular geographic area, but what's unique about last year is that virtually every part of the country was affected," Vilsack said. "It was different in every part of the country. We've not seen tornadoes as devastating as last spring. Flooding on the Missouri River, because of the long-standing nature of the flooding - not a two- or three-week situation - was unique. Fires in the southwest part of the country were historic in magnitude. It's been a tough year."
In 2010, 24 of 28 Mount Calvary members present (out of a congregation of 45) voted to join the Ordinariate, following a long-standing tradition of the Episcopal Church: democracy. Negotiations over real and church property ensued, and an amicable agreement was reached last month. It states that the Anglican Use Congregation (the term for a Roman Catholic congregation that is able to retain its Anglican worship rites) will be deeded the church building, adjacent offices and rectory; will keep all furnishings and personal property; and will retain the right to use the parking lot shared with Joseph Richey House, a hospice that started as a joint ministry by Mount Calvary and the All Saints' Sisters of the Poor. The Episcopal Diocese of Maryland will receive a monetary sum as part of the settlement, and will retain first right of refusal if the congregation vacates the property.

But today we you know that millions of individuals making their own decisions is far more effective than the decisions made by a few central planners. The Affordable Care Act will be overturned because it takes back the power from a few and returns it to the many.

Hundreds of runners will be pounding the pavement in Secaucus Sunday to raise money for service men and women wounded in combat, The Jersey Journal reports.
For now, Raskind insists he is not a candidate for the permanent job as CEO of the schools. But there's a growing trend in big-city school districts to hire business leaders. If Raskind succeeds in improving the district's management practices -- and my guess is he will -- the mayor, the school board and the search committee would be wise to put his name on the short list of candidates for a long-term contract.
ESSEX COUNTY -- Philip Alagia, the campaign manager for Essex County Executive Joseph DiVincenzo Jr., was watching the clock as today’s 4 p.m. deadline neared to file petitions to run in the June primary.
Johnson is one of a handful of participants in the scene, which ran from 2007-2010 and involved cold-calling timeshare owners and pretending to have willing buyers.
The Musician's Union has been trying to get a foot hold in the Portland industry for decades, and just recently has been moving in and focusing hard on building relationships with musicians in just the last few years. Still, I know of no one who has signed on. Why you ask? Well, in order for the Union to be effective (just like any union) everyone, or at least the majority of us, must join. The problem here, is that there are too many bands and too many "weekend warriors" that are willing to play for near nothing, or for mere drink tickets. If they only knew that they were ultimately limiting their own careers! So, without a union to be a proponent for the blue collar musician, most are making the same or far less than what musicians were making in the 70's (no joke!).
Late in the summer of 2010, as the San Diego Unified School District waded through yet another patch of budgetary quicksand, trustees gathered behind closed doors to talk about spiraling health care costs.

In The Boston Globe, reviewer Danielle Dreilinger said, "There are books that capture our world perfectly, like a scrim over a stage. And then there are books that surprise the audience and go somewhere new, somewhere completely unpredictable. In this collection, Evans paints a picture, sometimes ripping through the fabric. One wonders where she will go next." Dreilinger called Evans "a startlingly good sociocultural mimic," no matter if "she's observing people who work at Ruby Tuesday or Harvard students." She went on to praise Evans for creating heightened moments in these stories in which she "pulls off writing that makes your throat catch."

Through the process of Detroit Works Project Long Term Planning, we can work together to guide the shift to become a city that works better for our entire community.

I base this on history. At WrestleMania 18, the Triple Threat women's match was wedged between Hogan vs. Rock and Jericho vs. HHH. Last year, the six-person tag (involving Trish Stratus and Snookie) found a home after Taker vs. HHH, but before Cena vs. Miz. This year I “guarantee” the same positioning. Unfortunately, even with the involvement of Extra's Maria Menounos, this match doesn't have the level of interest most matches on the card do. This is a shame personally, because in my opinion there is a lot to look forward to in the Divas division. AJ is doing fantastic work with Daniel Bryan, Eve is finding her own niche as a master manipulator, Beth Phoenix is (as always) fantastic in the ring, Natalya would absolutely hold her own if given the opportunity, an imposing Kharma waits in the wings to inject a new look, the consistently entertaining Layla may soon return from injury, and Kelly Kelly works well as the face of the division, especially against an overpowering current Divas champion.

I grabbed my glasses and stumbled to the window. Lo and behold, there was the sun, climbing over my neighbors' homes and spreading its light and warmth to the world. Shrouded in the constant smoke leaking from the Busch brewery, it announced to all that a new day had come. A beautiful sight; so why was I terrified? I was well-rested but sore, as if I had been lying in the same position for many hours. Then I knew it: the baby. The baby had not made a sound all night and there was only one explanation for that: Our baby was dead.

Durbin said FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate told the senators the agency would discontinue using "no levee" modeling in the update process. Twenty-seven senators had written Fugate in February, asking that the agency change the process because it entirely disregarded existing levees instead of more precisely determining their effectiveness.
The New York Times called Figes' work an "extraordinary book about the impact of the gulag," and said the book "comes at an opportune moment, when the generation of survivors -- people born between 1917 and 1925 -- is dying out and a post-Soviet government is trying to burnish the history of Stalinism. It is the stories of these ordinary people that constitute the ultimate rebuke to Vladimir Putin's efforts to reimpose moral amnesia on Russia," and while "victims do not always make good witnesses," in Figes' work, "these survivors overcame their silence and have lifted their voices above a whisper."

Because the 24-passenger Aqua (and the 32-passenger sister ship, Aria) were built for this river instead of as seagoing vessels, every cabin and public space is walled by picture windows. (Even the bridge looked more like a recording booth than the traditional captain's post.)
Writing for me comes without hesitation. There will be nights where I am fast asleep, but automatically around 3 a.m. I will wake up, grab my notebook, and write a song. One's best writing takes place when they least expect it. However, in this case, I believe Shakespeare always wrote from his heart. Literally put his feelings onto paper. So that is exactly what I did for "Time With You." I took my real-life situation, and wrote it down.
Florida's off-the-grid theme park began with a rope swing.
And Crawford was at the forefront. Mixing his patented pull-up jumpers with breathtaking crossover moves, the Blazers' sixth man scored a season-high 34 points, making 10 of 18 field goals and 13 of 13 free throw attempts. Crawford had been mired in a slump for the better part of the last month and was shooting 28.6 percent from the field over his previous four games. But he broke out in a big way, offering a glimpse of the player who won the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year award in 2010.
Grand Valley at Coal Ridge, Coal Ridge, 7 p.m.
This was the first collapse. A wall of thick smoke and debris surged outward. Ash began to fill my eyes and throat. I banged on the glass door of a deli. Inside, two guys in white aprons shook their heads and mouthed "no." That was really upsetting. Finally I took refuge in a building lobby. People were gagging, vomiting grit. We broke into an emergency closet and retrieved plastic jugs of water.
There was no great brouhaha. It was probably because I explained the idea that the only way to dispel the notion that elected officials had to be black was to elect someone white. It isn't that Detroit needs a white savior; it is that Detroit needs a right savior. And at some point, color has to not matter.

No place in the Clifton-West 117th Street area is busier than this trendy gay bar on a warm night. The proprietors roll up the front walls, roll out the tables and the crowds -- pretty boys, mustachioed vets and club hounds of all sexes and stripes -- roll in. The vibe is high-energy gay club on DJ nights, laid-back corner bar other times. The cafe seating is the perfect spot to sip a beer or a martini, chitchat -- and, most important -- see and be seen.

Matt Kemp’s two-out single off Washington’s Ross Detwiler– the first hit he’d allowed to a No.3 hitter this season – preceded Ethier’s two-run homer into the Nationals’ bullpen.

A newer Jersey voice was heard in Newark on Friday night. Sleigh Bells frontwoman and Manasquan native Alexis Krauss gave the Beastie Boys a shout, too, dedicating her band's opening set to Yauch's memory. Sleigh Bells is exactly the sort of group that the Beasties would have enjoyed -- rhythm-heavy and fuzzed out, suffused with tawdry sexuality, and equally indebted to hip-hop, trash-pop and scuzz-punk.

Czolgosz had every reason to disagree with that assessment. He had bitter personal experience with the consequences of unfettered capitalism. The son of Polish immigrants, he went to work at age 10. The Panic of 1893 led the Cleveland Rolling Mill Co. to impose draconian wage cuts that provoked a strike; Czolgosz was among the workers blacklisted for walking off the job. He was "quiet and not so happy" after that, his brother remarked. Rejecting the devout Catholicism of his childhood, Czolgosz found a new religion in anarchism, which asserted that only through violent action could workers break the capitalists stranglehold on power. At this point, Miller leaves Czolgosz on the sidelines as he backtracks to trace the growth of anarchism from the 1870s through the 1890s, spending a good deal of time on the movement's key figures in the U.S.: Albert Parsons, Johann Most and Emma Goldman. Alternating chapters follow the progress of the Spanish-American War and McKinley's evolving attitude toward imperialism.

Katz was clearly taken aback. I didn't give you my tax returns, he said.
Nicasio was brilliant — seven innings, one run, one walk, four strikeouts on 82 pitches — and frankly left with no choice as the Rockies' offense fizzled again.

Fewer than half of the Santa Cruz vineyards and wineries have tasting rooms, and most of those that do limit their operating hours to weekends. Four times a year—in January, April, July and November—the Santa Cruz Mountains Winegrowers Assn. sponsors "Passport Days" in which about 50 wineries open for visitors. But most places welcome anyone who consults the association brochure and calls ahead to make an appointment.

But Carol Caruso, senior vice president at the Greater Cleveland Partnership, uttered those words just this week, as the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a Senate bill that sets a three-year, $60 billion budget for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The result is not just a bleak outlook for U.S. space exploration in general and for the future of NASA Glenn in particular, but also a violation of promises made by the Obama administration to at least three Cleveland-area legislators that Glenn would have a prominent place in its planning.
When they were kids, Jennifer and Pascal Dalseth spent lazy days canoeing, fishing and building bonfires on separate lakes in the Twin Cities. As adults, they wanted their kids to have the same kind of experience. They had looked for -- but failed to find -- lakeshore property close to Pascal's job in Apple Valley. The closest they found was a tract home in a Burnsville development near the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge.
From what I have gleaned, liquid Tide is supposedly the equivalent of liquid gold in the black market. The rumor mill is foaming with claims that Tide serves as a medium of exchange.

Separately, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio has told Diebold that it is not pursuing criminal charges against the company for transactions and accounting issues.
Spirit's fares are admittedly among the lowest, as I learned during a practice test. When I searched Kayak for a midweek flight from Washington to Fort Lauderdale, the Florida-based airline offered the least expensive ticket, at $122, including taxes. US Airways followed with $148. But if you go to Spirit's website, you avoid the charge for booking with a third party; there, I found a fare of $104.58. Additionally, score a coupon (they've typically offered $24 or $50 off) or a sale (the recent Get Out of Town Deals), and watch the numbers nosedive.

That's not to say there isn't a nugget of truth justifying instant outrage; often there is. But the emotional explosion can diminish the validity of the complaint. An example of cyber-outrage came the other day with an email-string seething at the injustice of calls for a quick trial, with the death penalty mentioned, for Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, accused of killing 17 Afghan civilians, in contrast to the leisurely pace of prosecution of Islamist fanatic Nidal Hasan for killing 13 people and wounding 29 in the 2009 Fort Hood shootings.

A strong performance on qualities such as honesty, confidence, likability and beyond could account for why 75% of Obama supporters say they are voting for him, as opposed to against Romney, but his incumbency brings along its own baggage. More than 60% of Romney supporters are voting directly against Obama, rather than in favor of the former governor. Only 29% of those polled think their minds could be subject to change before the election.

She would place her sons on each side of her, and when her beloved team reached the end zone, she taught them to jump up and yell “touchdown!” It didn’t bother her that neither of the boys played the sport growing up — even the one she named after Kyle Rote, the Giants running back. No one in the family did.

4. Tough decision: David West has a difficult choice to make. The Hornets leading scorer can opt out of the final year of his contract and become an unrestricted free agent. Because his salary for 2011-12 would be $7.5 million, it would seem a no-brainer for him to opt out.

First, we won't be using marina pumps for fill-ups. Heeding the warnings from industry experts about price spikes, Gerry pulled our 27-foot fishing boat out of dry-dock to fuel it up in March, when unleaded-regular gas prices at our local station were hovering at around $3.50 a gallon. The fill-up caused quite a commotion among the station's other customers, who found $50 for a tank of gas for their gas guzzlers a relative bargain. But well worth it: our initial fill-up cost about $100 less than we would have paid at the marina. (Granted, towing the boat with our gas-guzzling pickup has its own costs, but not significant enough to trump the savings from not using marina pumps.)

A boon? Or is it Big Brother? Diane J. Cook isn't in a position to judge, although she's convinced that her particular efforts, along with those of collaborating researchers at Washington State University at this point amount to data-gathering that one day could enlist our homes as partners in helping older adults live on their own for longer periods. Perhaps, she and fellow researchers reason, our apartments might find a way to prompt us if we forget to take our pills. Or Apartment 301 might suggest to caregivers that Grandma doesn't seem to be eating regular meals and needs to be checked on.

One solution may be to remove the carpeting and use floor paint. After filling any holes, you can paint the stairs and risers a color that would be appropriate for your décor. You can even use stencils. There are stencils that are not the bold, tacky, overdone ivy vine from 20-plus years ago. I'd recommend Stencil Library from England (stencil-library.com) where you can buy the stencil and see some great examples of completed work. The landing could be painted like a rug with a medallion in the middle and then a decorative border. You'll need to seal the paint afterward. The result can be as casual or as sophisticated as you choose.

One track, "The Verb," a tumbling folk song about a union on the verge of collapse, is about eight years old. The song dates to around the time Mr. Hansard and Ms. Irglova first met in the Czech Republic, when she was 13 years old and her father, a fan of Mr. Hansard's music, invited the singer home. "The Rain" sends a apologetic message to the Frames, Mr. Hansard's longtime rock band that was eclipsed by the success of "Once." (The Frames serve as the Swell Season's backing band.)

What happened in 2011 wasn't a fluke, the result of a weak schedule or magic dust being sprinkled on the team. It was what logically follows when a gifted coach  Jim Harbaugh  is put in charge and the right personnel moves coalesce under him. It is a discerning front office and ownership that have learned from mistakes and buried ego beneath a desire to succeed, sharing responsibility for attaining that success with everyone on the payroll.
