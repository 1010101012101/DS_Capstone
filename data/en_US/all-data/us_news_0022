Byron Wien has been publishing a New Year's list of possible economic and political "surprises" for years, often with impressive results. The idea is to identify events that are likely to happen but that the market believes have a low probability of occurring -- and that are therefore mispriced.

By the end of our journey into the pages of history, I think we all learned that, as is the case with so many other tales from our nation's past, the reality of the events always surpasses anything even a great poet like Longfellow could construct using a bit of fiction.

Maybe the larger problem is his point of view. He begins his article by criticizing the festival's mission "to break the barriers of stereotypes" because the lineup does "not actively push that agenda" because of (in part) our film about mariachi music. Maybe he doesn't realize mariachi is the national music of Mexico? By that rationalization, every American film with jazz or the blues must conform to stereotype. I think he's confusing breaking stereotypes with something else. Just because a Mexican plays mariachi music doesn't make them a stereotype. Just like a Chicagoan playing the blues doesn't equate stereotype. What is stereotypical, is an American assuming that every Mexican holiday is Cinco de Mayo.We would appreciate it if Mr. Stamets could rethink his (admittedly brief) comments about our film and his view of Chicago Latino Film Festival's mission and lineup in a context that maybe he isn't (as of yet) qualified to make them.

They returned to their car and watched Mr. Ausby as he walked down the street. Eliyahu Werdesheim testified that he grew concerned when he saw a woman with her dog down the block — yet another good time to call the police. Instead, Eliyahu Werdesheim got out of the car and sought to intercept Mr. Ausby again — he testified that his intention was to calm the teen. That was when the physical confrontation took place. Mr. Werdesheim claimed that the boy then came at him with a nail-studded two-by-four and swung the board toward his head, at which point he deflected the blow and knocked Mr. Ausby to the ground. Even if that was true, the fact remains that he never needed to be in that position in the first place.

The renewal of Waikiki's hotels — many of which were looking rather dated if not shabby at the start of the last decade — has continued as steadily as the surf sweeping the shoreline. Although not the very first wave of remodels, the reopening of Waikiki's magnificently restored and renovated grande dame, the Royal Hawaiian, happened to coincide with the inauguration of the first U.S. president from Hawaii, which only magnified the surge of island pride in the area. The Royal Hawaiian also now shares a water playground with the Sheraton Waikiki, which later added its own dazzling, adults-only infinity-edge pool and offers even more bedazzling views from its new club lounge, formerly the Hanohano Room.

The music and media conference and festival takes place March 12-16 and is headquartered at the Austin Convention Center downtown.

Depending on how you count, "Arrietty" is either the fourth or fifth film based on the classic children's book about smallness, "The Borrowers," and in spirit, it is a fairly faithful rendition of Mary Norton's 1952 novel.

Maybe Saturday's OT loss was a wake-up call, and if the Golden Bears can win out against Oakland Mills and Howard, they'll still be playoff-bound for the second straight season.

Rather than simply verify that people are looking for work, helping unemployed workers develop new networks with their employed peers could also increase employment. Volunteer professionals in the same field who pledge to aid the long-term unemployed in locating employment could provide direct connections needed to find work.
On paper, the Angels do look like the best team in the AL West – not only because they added Pujols. He will provide badly needed help for an offense that ranked 10th in the AL in runs scored last year. They're not likely to be an elite offense even with Albert, but they will likely rank as above average. And that should be more than enough support for the Angel pitching staff, which is an elite unit. They allowed the second-fewest runs in the AL last year, and with the addition of C.J. Wilson they may improve on that ranking in 2012. Wilson's departure from Texas makes the Rangers' already shaky rotation that much shakier. Texas still has time to make some acquisitions to even up the scales, but at the moment I'd pick the Angels to wrest the division crown back for the first time since 2009.

Finding something patients can easily eat and digest and, more importantly, want to eat, is why the medical staff at Chinese Hospital in San Francisco alternates rice congee and oatmeal on patient meal trays for breakfast.

Visiting specialists from the Skin Institute Group are also available to perform Mohs surgery – an advanced surgical technique that's effective in completely removing skin cancers. Today, Mohs is now widely accepted as one of the most effective techniques for removing Basal Cell Carcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (BCCs and SCCs), which are known as the two most common skin cancers. This technique spares a large number of healthy tissue while also most completely expunging cancer cells. The cure rates for both BCC and SCC stand at a massive 98 percent or higher which is significantly better than the rates for other standard methods.

The careful carving of a bird as big as a turkey is a project that will take at least 10 minutes for all but the most gifted.

It seems somewhat odd Mats Zuccarello just cannot play in the NHL. Maybe he can’t. There are, after all, educated people with the best interests of the organization at heart paid to make these decisions who have watched Zuccarello all season, but I must say, I find it strange a Rangers team always looking for pace and creativity doesn’t have a minute to spare for him.

Suited up in a tux, he moved lightly from table to table, and motioned with long, tapered fingers.

Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega highlighted his Christian faith during his re-election bid last year, when his campaign rallies were accompanied by religious processions, chants and the campaign slogan "Christian, Socialist and In Solidarity." Ortega’s campaign strategy dismayed Catholic Church leaders, who called his use of spirituality part of a ploy to deceive voters.
There was plenty to talk about. Yando is giving one of the great performances of his long Chicago career — the great performance, I'd say. He captures all the necessary sides of the nasty-but-compelling politico: his cynicism, malevolence, intelligence, sexuality, love of power, formidable insight into the baser aspects of human nature and his sense of humor. He is funnier than Al Pacino in this role and just as mercurial. He has a deeper sense of the man's horror at his own mortality. And, above all, Yando's Cohn is spectacularly present and alive.

Sen. Chris Romer, D-Denver, said he intends to amend a bill that creates regulations for medical-marijuana dispensaries to include a provision that places an excise tax on medical marijuana, similar to the special excise tax that already exists for alcohol.

Although it stumbles a bit over some unneeded melodrama toward the end, "The Green" is a thoughtful and sophisticated film about life in a post-marriage-equality world. The couple at the heart of the story have been together for several years, but Michael (Jason Butler Harner) is still commitment-shy when it comes to sealing the deal in marriage. He's a teacher; his boyfriend, Daniel (Cheyenne Jackson), is a caterer. A "Crucible"-like scandal not only tests the strength of the relationship but also the seemingly accepting welcome the men have received in the quiet New England town where they live.
Reporters were then ushered out of the locker room, so the amount of the fine and the exact reason for it is unclear. Jackson, who was named NFC special teams player of the week for his 72-yard punt return against the Giants on Sunday night, was actually the one who was struck in the head when Giants S Aaron Rouse gave him a head butt at the end of a play in the third quarter.

Business Administrator Bob Smith said that they made the move to hire a building inspector instead of contracting out for the service after determining an increased savings from doing so was “certain.” While the other inspection services of fire, electric, plumbing and elevator might also be more profitable to handle in-house, Smith said the administration wanted to wait to see how the change in building inspections progressed first. Council Vice President Chris Del Borrello, who presented the idea of bringing more inspections in-house during a presentation on possible areas of savings in the budget earlier this year, was concerned that may mean they could miss out on potential revenue.
A: No, but it does suit my persona. You're right, everything about me as a DJ is out of style and out of step. I didn't grow up wanting to be famous or wanting to be a celebrity.

"We have trod the face of the Moon, touched the nethermost pit of the sea, and can link minds instantaneously across vast distances. But for all that, it's not so much our technology, but what we believe that will determine our fate," Flannery proclaims in his "dual biography" of the planet and mankind.

- Reduces the collective bargaining power of about 360,000 public workers in Ohio. The current collective-bargaining law gives workers the right to negotiate on a broad scope of topics including wages, hours, working conditions and any provision from an expiring contract that an employer wants to change. Under SB 5, workers no longer have the right to bargain changes from a previous contract. Certain topics that have been central to negotiations, such as health care benefits, can’t be bargained anymore. Several other topics can be bargained only if management agrees. These topics, known as “management rights,” include the right to decide employee qualifications, starting and quitting times, work assignments, promotion rules and other topics.
