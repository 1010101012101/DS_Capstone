The challenge theme is 'anything goes'!!!!!! As many of you may know I've had problems with my Cricut, so this weekend I had to go to my MIL's house to use her Cricut. I have had so many people giving me a hand with a million different things (because we all know that when it rains, it pours) so I wanted to make 'Thank you' cards. Although this is a very simple card, it was exactly what I wanted. :)
Admittedly, Caitlin does Something Bad in Loving. We know it's bad, because it warrants no less than six exclamation marks in three paragraphs of text. And admittedly, she lets her rival for Jed's affections take the blame for the Bad Thing, and that's a little bit naughty of her. Well, very naughty. And despite the fact that she feels so guilty she can hardly function, she doesn't own up, so the girl she blamed has a nervous breakdown.
Looking for the happily ever after,

I can also recommend heartily the Lallands Peat Worrier who has been following the case for far longer than I have, and whose insights are always thought provoking, assiduously researched and elegantly drafted.
Anyone who knows me, knows that I like to stick close to home. I don't go on many trips and it's rare that I ever go anywhere without my baby. That being said, I have had to travel with work more in the past eight months that I've had to travel in the past eight years. Kentucky, Texas, and this past week Nevada (not to mention a couple trips to Cary). As much as I like to be home all the time and tuck my baby in bed every night, I have to admit, I've enjoyed these trips. I don't think that this makes me a bad mother because I miss Emily every minute, but I do enjoy sleeping in the middle of the bed and not having to get up extra early to get two people ready.
Social Media As springtime is here we find ourselves working more and more hours in the day. As we continue to evolve in our electronic age, here is a quick note about social media. Be careful using Wi-Fi. We are all very busy. We try to stay connected everywhere we go, in our car, at our favorite coffee spot and while waiting in line at the store. Information transmitted over a free Wi-Fi connection can be viewed by anyone. So think twice before logging into your bank account over an unsecured connection. Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn:When you use social media be aware of what you are posting and sharing and how that can be used. Limit the amount of personal information you share. Everyone doesn’t need to know where you are going to dinner tonight or when you are going on vacation. And finally let me close with our Five Second Rule
Morven, Ga., May 24. –(Special.)– There are some very old people in this district, among them being Mr. Norman Campbell, who came to this county in 1829. He was then a young man. Mr. Campbell is a full-blooded Scotchman. In 1846 he ran a wagon from Morven, then Sharp’s store to Magnolia, what was then a seaport town near the mouth of St. Marks river on the coast below Tallahassee, Fla. He hauled cotton down there and brought salt back. Cotton brought 3 to 4 cents per pound and salt brought in this county from $3 to $7 a sack, yet the people made some money and were contented. In this section are several other old men. Mr. George Mitchell is about eighty-six and so is John Delk. Mr. Mitchell came from Robeson county, North Carolina, and Mr. Delk from Liberty county, Georgia. Messrs. Campbell, Mitchell and Delk are the three oldest men in that section – all over eighty-five years old. Not very far behind these in age are Phillip Hiers, Rev. John Hendry and Richard Scruggs. Mr. George Mitchell gave Morven its name.
One Saturday morning, my husband and I were waiting for the bank to open. When we pulled into the parking lot, we noticed two or three County Police cars in the roadway and a line of mostly young people standing outside of a sports store. I waited in the car as my husband made his way to the bank, which was not yet open, so he returned to the car and told me what was going on. A sport’s shoe company was due to release the latest in a line of tennis shoes costing $263.00, and the people were in line to be the first to purchase a pair. The policemen were there in case things got out of hand. My first inclination was to judge and condemn those in line — a stronghold that I had to deal with. Emotions of Disgust and Pride threatened to enter my mind, and my Intellect perfectly described the state of this slow economy that we are in. My Desire was to preach to them of better ways to spend their resources. Then the Word of God came in with Matthew 7:1, “Judge not, that ye be not judged,” and my Pastor’s statement, “We must restore this generation.” My spirit, aided by the Holy Spirit, quickened my mind, reminding me of the time when I was their age and had to have (or coveted) a leather jacket and every color of a particular then-popular brand of leather shoes — a clear result of the lust of the eye and the pride of life (1 John 2:16). I had to repent, and I say again, renewing the mind is process, and we must be patient with those who have not started or are in the beginning stages of this process.
Revived started out a bit slow for me. I thought it was just going to be a formulaic science fiction, where the public discovers the big secret, or they find out the drug has horrible side effects, or something like that. But that's not what it is. I was pleasantly surprised by several unexpected plot developments. Revived becomes dramatic and heartfelt. There's a touching romance. I ended up caring about Daisy, as well as Audrey and Matt. Even Mason tugged a little at my heart.
So they were my June predictions. What about July? On 2011-07-07, when 10 year bond data came out, I wrote an article titled The chance of avoiding another downturn is now almost impossible.

When a child is born; he comes to this world alone. With time he learns to value those relationships and those people who mean a lot to him. I would say he learns to live together, he learns to smile together, he learns to dream together; in one line I would say, “He become a member of a team called family”.
I'd like to go back to counseling to work out a few more things.

I believe your children, friends, homes and possessions somehow magically find you in your life. This sounds like heresy to the shopping population, as we do a great deal of scouring in dusty corners. I always believe, when I open an old folio of photographs, that I will see somebody that I once knew, and I have. Underneath it all, shoppers are snoops. In all my Nancy Drew and Harriet the Spy fantasies, when I fall into a search coma, I am solving a mystery, connecting dots and looking for clues. If you have been with me for awhile, you will know my Father's adage: "Train your eye dear."

While it is painfully obvious that I do NOT support Atleo in the upcoming election, it is important to note that I do not and will not be publicly supporting any candidate that chooses to put their name forward. I think candidates need to stand on their own past records, their ability to lead and inspire our peoples, and the quality of their election platforms. In other words, I do not believe we should support candidates based on who endorses them. This becomes a popularity contest instead of one which is based on traditional leadership virtues.

When I moved up here I found the majority of Scottish sitcoms, with the exception of Rab C. Nesbitt, hard to watch, they seemed very 'knockabout.' Things like Still Game, the 'Dear Green Place' or 'Gary Tank Commander,' tend to eschew attempts at realism and go for a broader comedy with the laughs coming from one-liners or overtly 'comic' characters or scenes. You don't tend to get the flawed, failed characters that form the backbone of English comedy or the element of bleakness, tragedy and isolation you get in the likes of 'the Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, ' and 'Steptoe and Son,' or the naturalistic feel of the Royale family. Its not a complaint. It is not a criticism, (apart from Gary: Tank Commander, which is actually appalling) only an observation and a curiosity why this should be the case.

There is not a more powerful means to obtain true contrition than the Sacrifice of Holy Mass. Let sinners who desire their conversion come with confidence to it: Jesus Christ will speak in their favour, and will appease the just anger of his eternal Father, and obtain for them the gift of penance. This the Council of Trent teaches us.

Martial law can be defined as the military taking control of a city, state or country and running it at their discretion. The military would impose control on a civilian population when law and order cannot be maintained by the civil authorities. Martial law scenarios would likely involve a restriction, erosion or suspension of your Constitutional rights by government decree.

12) I gave up on finding the faucet handle and stood, covering the faucet with my hand, which only resulted in the water spraying everywhere. I grabbed around for one of the raincoats, and I found one under a sopping wet parka that suddenly weighed 20 pounds. I put it halfway on with one hand, then quickly switched my hands on the faucet and finished getting the coat on. (I was already soaking wet. I’m not sure why I thought putting on a coat would be a good idea at the time. Maybe it was years of conditioning by my parents.) I pulled the hood up over my head and looked around again. There were now two inches of water on the bottom of the closet.

For me, the answer to this question is simply no. There’s nothing in any of these oblivious candidates which suggests they are willing to put aside their preconceived personal ideals and make the decisions that are necessary for the good of this nation. I can only hope that come Election Day, “We the People” vote and make the decision that is necessary for the good of this nation.
Those who wrongly assume that government and administration is one and the same thing will have some difficulty in imagining a society without government. A society without administration would indeed be impossible since "society" implies that human beings organise themselves to provide for their needs. But a society without government is both possible and desirable. Socialism will in fact mean the extension of democratic administration to all aspects of social life on the basis of the common ownership of the means of production and distribution. There will be administrative centres but they will merely be clearing-houses for settling social affairs.

In Colombia there is a word used to describe an event where people come together in unification. In the U.S. we might refer to it as a "group retreat" or possibly a "team-building conference." Here it is called a convivencia (literally, "living together"). Since the 9th graders I teach lost the privilege to go for a week to Isla Gorgona due to irresponsible behavior by many during a similar event as 8th graders and several incidences this current school year with theft and poor treatment of substitutes, it was decided several days away from school with the teachers in an isolated environment to work out some class issues, might be a positive thing.

He was so obviously finding me a total embarrassment. Can't think why, I only said things like:

15.) Babes (pronounced “Bebs”)
So when a millionaire receives income from working they pay at the highest percentage rate of taxes (not counting deductions) then they take that money and invest it (means making it work by putting it into other business) then when they receive additional income from that investment they only pay approximately 15% on that investment. Now that money that they were paid for their investment has already been taxed for the company paying the interest on the investment in several different ways and now that it has been paid back to the investor he must now pay that additional 15% on it. Keep in mind that if he lost his investment he can only deduct that which he lost minus whatever he had received on it (this is very simplistic but close enough I think – if you invested $10,000 and had received $1,000 on it you now lost $9,000). I am not sure if you can declare the complete $9,000 as deduction but even if you can you have lost much more than that in reality as if you had just put it into a bank or some bonds or such you probably would have earned more (unless this is a short term loss) but you can not take that into account – you also can not take into account that you previously paid taxes on the $1,000.

We did have a bit of drama when we first arrived. The realtor had given us the code to the house's lockbox, which Tom punched in. It didn't work. Thinking the internal mechanism might be frozen, he punched the numbers in harder. Again and again, but the box still wouldn't open. Watching this from the warm van, the kids and I became mildly panicked and began calling on every saint in heaven for assistance. Tom got back into the van, called our realtor, and got a recording that her number had been disconnected.

Stephens, Atkins and Kingston (2009)* researched the effect swearing had on people’s pain tolerance. Participants immersed their non-dominant hand in very cold water and repeated their chosen swear word at an even rate throughout. This was compared with the same procedure when the swear word had been replaced by an innocuous word. Each participant’s heart rate was measured before and after submerging their hand in the cold water. Anxiety, pain catastrophising and fear of pain were assessed prior to submersion, and perception of pain measured after.

Since its origin, fundamental teachings of the Watchtower Society have been based on and intimately tied to the idea that serious Bible students could determine with reasonable accuracy when Christ would return, either through chronological calculations or observation of unique world events which would serve as a sign of Christ’s imminent return or advent (or both). Generically, Christians who believe that to be possible have been called “Adventists”.

Friends, today I was happy because I didn't have to close at work, and it is my "Friday." I ate the food that was on my menu today. I did weigh in and find myself at 136.2 (0.8 pounds up from last week, I believe). *sighs* These last few pounds sure are being stubborn, and I know that things like donuts don't help. But, moving forward, I'm going to eat completely on plan this week and will see a drop on that scale next Monday. But on the bright side, my butt is looking awesome. No, really. Not being vain here (okay, maybe a little). But it just is. It's more lifted than it used to be, yet it's still pretty much just as round (which I like), and it's a lot firmer. So yay for that! My arms and abs are also looking pretty stellar again. So take that, scale! I don't care what you say 'cause I like what I'm seeing when I look in the mirror.
What is a lamp without oil worth? What is a religion without God? What is a local church without His presence? What was the Holy of Holies without the ark of the covenant? When that veil was ripped in two while Jesus hung upon the cross, did it not expose the fact that the mercy seat was not there? And yet for 500 years the system of religion had carried on right up till Jesus’ time without an ark, without any mercy seat, going through the motions of deadness until they could not recognize the Son of God when He walked into that very Temple. Do we now suffer from the same blindness, going about our business, unaware of how the Lord has been departing, by stages, the churches, leaving behind an institution of works and politics and humanism?
Here is the latest from Keg Liquors in Clarksville:
Mackenzie, too, publicly supported regime change when he prayed for William and Mary at the kirk. However, the latter’s track record of aiding moderate presbyterians and support for the Revolution seems to have cut little ice with the local Society people, as Mackenzie was threatened by ‘armed men’, almost certainly Society people and other locals who were intent on rabbling him out of Mid Calder parish, and ‘warned to desist’ from preaching. Despite being granted protection by the Committee of Estate in May 1689, the threats seem to have taken their toll as Mackenzie fled from the parish and became a brewer in Edinburgh. (Fasti, I, 177; M’Call, Parish of Mid Calder, 231.)
Karl Marx himself has stated that “The meaning of peace is the absence of opposition to socialism,” a sentiment that corresponds almost exactly to the Islamic idea that “peace” means the absence of opposition to Islamic rule. Cultural Marxism — aka Political Correctness — and Islam share the same totalitarian outlook and instinctively agree in their opposition to free discussion, and in the idea that freedom of speech must be curtailed when it is “offensive” to certain groups. Former Muslim Ali Sina notes that “there is very little difference between the Left and Islam. What is lacking in both these creeds is the adherence to the Golden Rule. Just as for Muslims, everything Islamic is a priori right and good and everything un-Islamic is a priori wrong and evil, for the Left, everything leftist is a priori oppressed and good and everything rightist is a priori oppressor and evil. Facts don’t matter. Justice is determined by who you are and not by what you have done.” “Political correctness is an intellectual sickness. It means expediently lying when telling the truth is not expedient. This practice is so widespread and so common that it is considered to be normal.” Sina also quotes historian Christopher Dawson in writing: “It is easy enough for the individual to adopt a negative attitude of critical skepticism. But if society as a whole abandons all positive beliefs, it is powerless to resist the disintegrating effects of selfishness and private interest. Every society rests in the last resort on the recognition of common principles and common ideals, and if it makes no moral or spiritual appeal to the loyalty of its members, it must inevitably fall to pieces.” This will be the end result of Multiculturalism, and one suspects that this was the point of it to begin with.

von Trier is a filmmaker that I'm more familiar with by reputation than experience, as many of his films (particularly Anti-Christ) have always sounded just a little too daunting and intense, but Melancholia makes me want to rectify that. From the darkly beautiful and operatic prologue, in which von Trier shows the entire story's trajectory, including the Earth's destruction, straight through to the nightmarish ending, Melancholia had me absolutely riveted. There are still a number of films I have left to see this year, but I have a hard time imagining that Melancholia won't be included in my year end best list.

With rising operating costs in the 1980s, many David’s Cookies storefronts closed down. The company was purchased by Fairfield Gourmet Foods Corp - a New Jersey based gourmet dessert company who rejuvenated the David’s brand by introducing these high quality cookies and frozen cookie dough into the food service and co-branding industries. Then, in the late 1990s, the company took the next step and made an online cookie store. Today, David’s Cookies is the leading provider of fresh baked cookies on the Internet, and continues to win awards including getting voted one of Good Housekeeping Magazine’s 10 Best Mail-order Goodies for Giving (or Serving), December 2007 for their mini cheesecake selections. The David’s Cookies brand is also growing by leaps and bounds in the corporate gifting industry, with new additions to their cookie gift basket selection, giant message cookies and other great gift ideas."

That we could possibly have the counter-Reformation at last seems impossible, and yet all around us the false dawn of secularism is fading into a desperate night in a red light district.

Now, I'm very lucky and run a brewery on an estate with more history and stories than you can shake a proverbial stick at, so I am naming all my beers after Welbeck-y stuff. Racehorses were a huge doo for the 6th Duke of Portland in particular, and many of the buildings on the estate were built for the equestrian world; stables, a riding school etc. St. Simon was one of the most famous racehorses that ever there was, and it was owned by the Duke. I will be brewing a years series of special ales based on the racehorses at Welbeck which will lead up to the new exhibition at the Harley Gallery. If you follow Welbeck on Twitter and Facebook you'll learn about them as they pop up but I'll try and blog too.

A bit of hometown pride certainly swells up when seeing Boulevard on the Craft Beer Big 12 list. Boulevard had actually been in the #10 spot for 2010 production, but big jumps from Lagunitas (see #11) and acquisitions by brewery collectives pushed them down to the #12 spot for 2011 production. There's not much to say about Boulevard that hasn't already been said, and it's silly for me to sing the praises of this brewery to the home crowd, so I'll just say this: really looking forward to Rye-on-Rye, you guys!

But as soon as the girls cross the Golden Gate, the scheme starts to unravel amid the bellbottoms, love-beads, and bongs. Chloe’s secrets escalate until she betrays everyone she cares about. MJ, who has grave doubts about Chloe’s plan. Her groovy aunt Kiki, who’s offered the girls a place to crash. Her self-absorbed mother meditating back in Phoenix. And maybe, especially, the boy she wishes she’d waited for.
Let's make something perfectly clear here: this is not going to be a repeat of the I-35W Bridge disaster in Minneapolis. Nobody thinks the bridge is going to fall down. It's not structurally deficient, it's "functionally obsolete." People whine about the crash rate, but just as with the BQE in Brooklyn, it would be a lot safer (and undergo less wear and tear) if the Thruway Authority wasn't trying to squeeze seven lanes of traffic onto a bridge where there's really only room for six.

In some countries, banks are forming partnerships with multiple telecommunications companies. “The mobile money network we now have in place, through partnerships with four different telecoms companies in Ghana, has enabled us to extend our services to reach customers in every part of the country,” Owureku Osare, Ecobank’s head of transaction banking in Ghana, told Africa Renewal.
This past week I started working at Lord and Taylor ... they need holiday-season sales associates and I, for a change of pace, was hired on the spot. I guess to say that they "need" people is an understatement. I actually got training these past couple of days from a very outgoing sales manager, obviously the kind of personality-type the folks at Lord and Taylor are looking for ... they certainly emphasized that enough, and I hope I'm up to snuff. The key, I think, is to just come across as knowledgeable and approachable. Lord and Taylor has a long history, though, that they seem to be very proud of ... which is a stark contrast from most businesses that only want to concentrate on what's hip and contemporary.

Monounsaturated fats help raise levels of beneficial high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. These HDL molecules act like bodyguards, capturing “bad” LDL molecules in the arteries and escorting them to your liver, where they’re filtered out of the body.
Of course that trip was easy and quick. So I thought I might just peek into the Castle. It had been a while since I had been through Nektropos Castle, so some scouting seemed in order.
The only picture I have is several days later, so it's not quite as fresh. Neither D nor I were quite sure if we liked the "topping." It was a bit sweet and, to me, had a little too much of a yeasty taste. Still quite fun. For my sandwich, I used roasted squash, sauteed peppers, mushrooms, and swiss cheese with some hummus all toasted together.

“Facts,” John Adams once said, “are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.” The facts in this case stubbornly prevent an interpretation that Brodhead acted to defend either due process or the presumption of innocence. The record of his actions, and that of how his actions were interpreted by key players at the time, suggests a radically different thesis.

Whiskey? Back in the 1980s, most American distilleries didn't bottle anything but standard stuff; no small batches, no single barrels no super-aged Pappy. Many Scottish distillers didn't do single malt bottlings, it all went to blends. If they did singles, they weren't available except in specialist stores. And no one knew a damned thing about them or how they were made. Same thing with beer, really.

There is, no doubt a good argument why we should prolong this predatory and dysfunctional economic, social and sexual system; but I do not know what it is. There is, on the other hand, every reason not to write a column like this.
After lunch (thanks Dick) at a hotdog hotspot in downtown Montgomery, we made a quick stop in a cemetery to see the grave of Hank Williams Sr. Many of Judie’s relatives are also buried in this cemetery, and they wanted to check on the planting of two trees that they had recently made at the gravesites. I’m familiar with many of Hank Williams’ songs, but didn’t realize that he died at the young age of 30. He has a peaceful resting place.

Here is the Christmas miracle - I have no idea how long my little flatiron had laid there at the bottom of the tub. Of how long the water had seeped into it's insides causing it's electrical death - but friends I am here to tell you my little flatrion survived. After 36 hours of laying on the counter and my constant care to shake the water out, praying that it would come back to life - IT LIVES. TRUE STORY. I plugged it in - holding my breath - the little red light came on and the ping to say there was power; 30 seconds later a second ping - "I am HOT" it called to me - and I rejoiced as my little flatiron lived another day to straighten my hair.
Now that I am finished teaching for a month, I am thrilled to get my hands busy on some projects of my own desire, in addition to the dreaded ongoing yard landscaping. I did a simple reupholstery job for an old neighbor of mine on her mother's rocking chair. When she first showed it to me, I was so excited to work on this and secretly wished she would give it to me in the end. Of course that won't be the case as it is a family heirloom and has very special meaning to her since it reminds her of watching her sweet momma playing the piano in that rocker day after day as she grew up. The modernized shabby chic vision I had for this cutie pie was not her vision at all however, and she wanted to keep the rocker looking as similar to its original form as possible, but wanted it to be cleaned up. The gimp (trim) had started to come off and had been amateurly stapled back on by a family member, the fabric was quite old and worn, and unbeknownst to her, the interior foam was disintegrating and very little of it remained.
We are prediminantly a vegetarian family and were really quite taken back by the rather pitiful 1oz portion of cheese that rations permitted per person per week. Sugar on the other hand, was to us rather 'over rationed'. 12 oz per person per week. That's quite a lot, although everywhere you read they complain that it wasn't much!!
I think hair is the nuisance of every Black girl's life. First, it takes so long to do. Can you imagine as 4 year old having to sit still for an hour? Even the day-long styles take a lot longer than ponytails: 5-10 minutes or so.
Take yourself…on a date. Spend time alone and explore what you like to do. It’s always nice to be with somebody else but sometimes there is something you want to do that a friend or family member might not want to. Is there a movie you want to see?Go! A restaurant you want to try? Why not?

I made it to my first festival since officially moving here. The 5th Annual Hood River Hops Festival was a blast. The weather was pretty good other than it dumping rain a few times. There were enough good beers on tap to keep me busy between the rain downpours. One of my favorites of the festival was Vernon the Rabbit Slayer from Big Horse Brewpub (from right there in Hood River). Vernon is a big fresh hopped Double IPA with tons of flavor and body. Another of my favorites was also a fresh hopped beer - Elemental Ale from Pelican Brewing in Pacific City, OR.

In my non-expert opinion, as a kid, I thought she was messed up. As an adult? I still think at least her BEHAVIOR was messed up. To extend mercy and grace toward her, I'll just say that she probably had reached a point in her career where she already should have retired, and I say that based NOT on her actual age, but on some of the behaviors I'll be describing in this story.

Also maybe I will actually get up with him in the mornings like he wants me to and then take a walk before the kids get dropped off.

Let's just say you might have found me crying in my cold car in the garage at 2am one morning. Shawn has been so fabulous and has been strong when I couldn't be. He has taken a big hit on his sleep, all while working full time and I soooo appreciate it!

At age eleven Taylor Markham was abandoned by her mother. At fourteen, she ran away from boarding school, only to be tracked down and brought back by a mysterious stranger. Now seventeen, Taylor's the reluctant leader of her schools underground community, whose annual territory war with the Townies and visiting Cadets has just begun. This year, though, the Cadets are lead by Jonah Griggs, and Taylor can't avoid his intense gaze for long. To make matters worse, Hannah, the one adult Taylor trusts, has disappeared. But if Taylor can piece together the clues Hannah left behind, the truth she uncovers might not just settle her past, but also change her future.
I feel a lot better and I see a little bit of difference in the tone so I thought when I stepped on the scale today that I would have at least lost a little. Nope….I gained a pound. Now I am not going to get too upset about this because weight fluctuates on a daily basis by a few pounds but I still get bummed when the scale doesn’t do any encouraging.
Night two was after his birthday party and he had no nap! So I rocked him to sleep in Callie's room in no time and laid him down.

Over the past three or four sessions we have had all kinds of legislative champions, who understand the community corrections system and are willing to focus more on treatment than retribution. As a probation official, I am pleased to see the message finally getting across. Being tough on crime is a great message, but it doesn't always mean a prison sentence. Much of the time being tough means holding people accountable and making them productive. In many cases, that is a far more severe sanction.Many people don't believe that a probation sentence can be a "far more severe sanction" than a prison sentence, but there are many reasons why that can be true. Probation restrictions can be severe, including curfews, bans on drinking alcohol, and regular urinalysis requirements. What's more, probationers must pay significant fees, restitution and treatment costs, perform community service, and at least try to remain employed, which is collectively more than some people who wind up on probation - who may have chaotic, messed up lives to begin with - have ever personally accomplished before.
Virtue is doing it.
. . . where a waiver of immunity occurs in an earlier action that is dismissed, or an entirely separate action, courts, including our own, have held that the waiver does not extend to the separate lawsuit. See Tegic, 458 F.3d at 1342-43 (discussed below); City of S. Pasadena, 284 F.3d at 1157-58. In City of S. Pasadena, relied upon by the district court in this action and described above, the dismissal without prejudice was found to prevent the "carry over" of an earlier waiver to a new lawsuit. City of S. Pasadena, 284 F.3d at 1157-58. Likewise, in Tegic, this court held that a State university’s participation in one lawsuit did not amount to a waiver of immunity in a separate lawsuit, even one involving the same patent. 458 F.3d at 1342-43.
Environmentalism is the mask of communism, concentrating ownership of all property and productivity in the hands of the government. Even when addressing the need to ensure clean air and water, it has been used as a blunt instrument of power to limit economic development.

sUAS Newsnotes that the purpose of this new approach is to develop non-lethal warhead which will be deployed on miniature precision munitions such as Lethal Miniature Aerial Munition System (LMAMS). LMAMS is a small, soldier-carried, soldier-launched loitering precision munitions system which is organic at the small unit level. LMAMS aim to offer soldiers a portable, non-line-of-sight precision strike capability against stationary or moving individuals. With LMAMS, soldiers will have a system capable of achieving high precision effect from covert positions, with a low risk of collateral damage.

In the weeks leading up to the race, it was uncertain whether it would happen at all. Tensions over the race where high and there were major safety concerns, for the teams and their drivers. The media were also hesitant and recommended to stay in designated hotels, throughout the week. However, the show must go on and despite the protests, Sunday provided another unpredictable race, in what’s becoming a historic season.
Good steps are to be recognized and applauded, but we must always strive for better. We need to continue onward and upward. It would be good to have a statement from the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Communications as to the governments’ commitment to a progressive policy in these important matters.

Like most do now-a-days, Bug's borrowed crib can convert to a toddler bed. We had never found the need to make the change, though, since she liked the crib and (with one exception before the mattress had been lowered for the final time) she'd never tried to climb out of it. With Sherman's birthday drawing nearer, we debated about the best course of action to take to make room for the little guy. Change Bug's bed into the toddler bed and buy our own crib? Buy Bug a twin mattress and put it on the floor until she's a bit bigger? Keep Sherm in the pack n' play until Bug was ready for a big girl bed?

As I’ve stated before, I don’t really consider myself a comic book girl. I’ve dabbled with some titles – The Walking Dead, the Scott Pilgrim series, The Watchmen and Fables – but I’ve never been a regular reader or read any of the super hero titles, which is what I think most people first think of when they think of comics. Part of the reason is that these series have been running for many years and it is hard for a newbie to know where a good place is to jump in (kind of like soap operas). DC comics recently tried to address this problem by rebooting 52 of their titles all at the same time. I’ve been planning to check a few of them out, but haven’t done so yet (though if I was forced to declare allegiance, I’m more of a Marvel girl despite my fondness for Batman).
I hope that you, and any children in your life, appreciate this book as much as I did.
“Do you mean literally or metaphorically?” I ask.
This overheated hostility toward public schools runs throughout the new literature on liberal homeschooling, and reveals what is so fundamentally illiberal about the trend: It is rooted in distrust of the public sphere, in class privilege, and in the dated presumption that children hail from two-parent families, in which at least one parent can afford (and wants) to take significant time away from paid work in order to manage a process—education—that most parents entrust to the community at-large.
We were just given a 2nd chair and a half from a relative (currently covered in maroon floral fabric), that I am planning to slipcover in gray. And we have white sheer curtains that I am planning to layer behind some new modern white and navy panels. I also want to incorporate navy into the room with throw pillows and some new artwork. I am thinking white gallery shelves (probably from IKEA) above our white sectional (also from IKEA).

For light drinking around the house, I picked up a six pack of Great Divide Brewing's Samurai Rice Ale and a six pack of Grand Lake Brewing's Stumpjumper IPA. I found myself turning to these during my short stops by the family place, usually in the evenings between 8 and 10 pm after travels up Clear Creek Canyon or to top off a day with the CCC boys at the reunion.
You can give me all the arguments of bad economy and the need to be pragmatic in making sense in the short term business perspective. But it's time to swallow the pragmatism in favor of a long term vision, of creating a community that really understands and loves tango.
The mother uncorked on me for correcting her kids, but she wasn’t doing a damn thing about it so of course I was going to take matters into my own hands. As a hardcore bowler I take bowling etiquette very seriously. I won’t even take my place on the approach until my neighbors are done, much less start my shot. Of course, it could be that I just take the game way too seriously for an amateur (but trying to go professional) bowler. Who knows.

Seeing is the dominant sense visual learners use. They learn best by looking, reading, and writing things down. In contrast to auditory learners, visual learners tend to focus on the visual component of the lecture such as highlighted terms or diagrams rather than what the instructor is saying. When working with others, they are often the note-takers of the group. When reviewing alone, they not only read their texts and notes but also make additional notes to reinforce their studying.
Given my penchant for seventies television references, it might not surprise you that I am often a bit out of touch with contemporary popular culture. Still, because my gym pumps in the current top 20 on an endless cycle, I am able to at least identify songs that are circulating widely. Over the past few months, I have come to two conclusions. One, Fox is making a fortune off those Glee kids. Two, this country seems to prefer our young women to be drunk and reckless.

I see if some black group of kids beats up some innocent white person you people go ballistic and demand that 40 million people of African descent not only condemn what was done or we are responsible for setting race relations 100 years backwards. Yeah you whites will make us feel guilty if it was in reverse.

For above Kalia's crib, I wanted some of our maternity pictures displayed. I initially planned on just doing some sort of canvas or frames, but after doing the gallery wall above the dresser, I decided I needed something a little bit different for above the crib. I walked in and out of there about 1000 times, and finally came up with something that I thought I'd like...decoupaging our maternity pictures to a big huge K.

There is another, and more important, renewal that we can experience any time of the year. That is the new life which is created when we put our faith, trust and obedience in the Lord, Jesus Christ. We are instructed in 2 Cornithians 5:7; “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.” Sure, we may look the same and our voice will sound the same, but we become a new being spiritually, with a new, eternal future in His kingdom. And the same way that Springtime often urges us toward hopefulness and anticipation, following Christ yields a new outlook on life built on the promises and love of God, the Creator.

Though incidents where young men and girls leaving have stopped but some young folks from villages especially dalits and tribals seem to have taken it as a cause where they see it as a defiance against the powerful “corrupt” elite and those leading them are those youngsters of 1960s and 1970s who have grown old now and have nothing else left but this ideological war for themselves as they have already sacrificed alot for it, their families and hope for better life for themselves.

I have plans to help us – our department – to work better and I wish others felt as strongly as I did about getting ourselves more organised. I can see the workshop potentially pushing out more jobs within its shifts than we currently do but sometimes it feels like I’m the only one who understands that this is possible. If I was to have a little co-operation from people in leadership roles we could complete not just the jobs that are brought to our attention during the day but we could also start chipping away at the pile of outstanding ones.
I called Kirsten and told her I was in the neighborhood, and she told me to come on over. She was very welcoming, and I enjoyed talking with her. I asked her about the crime, and she said...it was kind of "patchy". Which is what I heard prior to arrival....but not prior to making it part of my trip. "Like a checker board", I heard. One block, fine...two blocks later: sketchy. "If it feels sketchy, it is", I heard. :) Luckily, I am intuitive to a fault.

This was the first of two collections of myths and legends from all round the world, illustrated by my friend Jane Ray and published by Orion. The other was Sun, Moon and Stars and they were both gorgeous books to work on.

Then we modified the text for any changes the artwork had suggested might be improvements. This one won a prize: The Primary English Award.

Clearly, accusations of Western involvement in Russia’s opposition, where every prominent leader has documented ties to the US State Department and its various subsidiaries, are more than just Kremlin-controlled propaganda. It is the demonstrative truth and it is indeed the Western media spreading unsubstantiated lies regarding Russian politics, spun from compromised NGOs like GOLOS, and viewed through the prism of US-funded and backed opposition leaders like Boris Nemtsov, Vladimir Ryzhkov, and Alex Navalny.

Family law in Gaza, like in most Arab countries, is based on Sharia Islamic law. It awards legal guardianship of the child to the father while granting physical custody for rearing the child to the mother until a boy reaches age 9 and a girl reaches age 12, although some countries have now extended that to age 15 regardless of gender. However, a mother would not be able to leave the country with her children without the father’s permission.

This blog post from TEACHING|chemistry expresses a lot of my frustrations about the common point-grading systems. It drives me nuts to see a kid who can cruise by, doing no homework and acing tests, and getting D’s because the points don’t work to his favor, despite clearly knowing the material. It also drove me nuts to see a few kids working their tails off for a few more points, while peers who didn’t give a flying fig got higher grades. Some of them just gave up and quit or stopped working altogether. I understand the frustration: I mean, on a transcript, an F is an F: doesn’t matter if it’s 0% or 59.9% of the points allotted.

So now all I have to do is sign up. I have actually recruited a running partner to train with too which is AWESOME! Jeff is one of my best friends from home and we live an hour apart but we are going to try to run some long runs together when the mileage adds up in our training program and provide support to each other along the way. We decided to use the same running training schedule again, I figured the novice program worked the first time it should work just fine this go around too. The program is 18 weeks (which I don't have 18 weeks of time left) so I am starting on week 3 right now but I was pretty much running that mileage on the treadmill anyways at the gym in between the spin classes and some weight training during the week.
Obama is the most secret and devious president in history. There must be many significant things in his past that, if revealed, would quickly show those who voted for him the error of their ways. His failure to disclose his original birth certificate, his visa and financial aid application record, and all of the above indicate he is not the persona he displays to the public. He is playing the game of non-disclosure, opaqueness, and obfuscation with great adeptness. That should earn him a quick exit from the White House when his term expires if not before.
It just so happened that the bar was the first on the Carnage Pub Crawl. For those who don’t know Carnage, it is a University based pub crawl that takes place all over the country.

I have felt very strongly that I am to be an advocate for marriage, family, and traditional values. I have never taken the time to acknowledge my white heritage. I would love to know more about my own white family and their traditions. I feel at age 42 that I am so far behind, and that I am creating a new heritage as I go along. I plant the same vegetables that my great grandmother, Vernie, used to feed to me from her garden. I have her photo in my kitchen, and I talk to her from time to time. I believe that she pushes me along to be a dutiful wife and mother and do God’s work. She was fat and wore a big apron and always had a supply of day-old iced doughnuts, frozen in knotted old bread wrappers. I loved her and now I miss her terribly. She died when I was 16. She was the epitome of my white heritage, and of true strength and femininity, and I try to honor her with my work.

Can anyone doubt that if there were more than 1300 hunger strikers in any country in the world other than Palestine, the media in the West would be obsessed with the story? It would be featured day after day, and reported on from all angles, including the severe medical risks associated with such a lengthy refusal to take food. At this time two Palestinians who were the first to start this current wave of resistance, Thaer Halaheh and Bilal Diab, entering their 64th day without food, are reported by the prisoner protection association, Addameer, and the NGO, Physician for Human Rights-Israel, to be in critical condition with their lives hanging in the balance. Despite this dramatic state of affairs there is scant attention in Europe, and literally none in North America. It is the case that prison protests, even large-scale ones such as occurred in California a year ago often attract little national and international notice unless deaths occur, as happened in the famous Maze Prison IRA hunger strikes back in 1981, but to ignore this expression of Palestinian resistance in the overall context of the conflict with Israel is lamentable. After all, as an occupying power of Palestinian territories Israel has a particular responsibility to the international community.

Why all the sudden do consumers demand personalized experiences? What changed after hundreds of years of commerce where bulk interaction was sufficient? Humans have always been self-centered beings. Its our nature, regardless of how well some can resist the urge. We want the world to revolve around ourselves, so we seek out opportunities for becoming that center of orbit. It’s why we want a trusted confidant in our doctor or a waiter who will tell us what to order. It’s why “have it your way” was such a successful slogan. We have always craved these personal experiences, but only as isolated incidents that were difficult to scale and had no real bearing on the core values of an organization. There was never a need to structure a company’s business model around ego stroking. Then the Internet happened, and it inflated everyone’s natural urges to self-serve.

I started this blog as a way to continue writing, which I love, and to share views and topics that mean a lot to me, which range from books and movies to the environment and other societal issues. Sounds like a grand plan (at least to me) but I'm finding it easier said than done. This blog is a way for me to get my voice out there and hopefully find others who feel the same or who share the same interests I do. All too often I read about news and happenings that make me feel discouraged about what's going on in the world, and I'm thankful for all the people out there who post things about everyday life that put a smile on my face or make me think a little harder about the life I'm living. This blog, for me, is a symbol that there are people out there who also feel that there's a lot to be improved and hopefully inspire thoughts and ideas that help us cope better, and make a difference in our own little part of the world.

You caught the past tense back there, right? Yeah, my sewing machine has been acting up for the last month or so, randomly skipping stitches, but still working *enough* to get through every project. Well. Not anymore. On Saturday, I was trying to finish up a last minute Jessica Bunny (not Rabbit, but pretty much the same) costume for a murder mystery dinner party (so fun!), when my machine decided it was done just skipping a few stitches here and there, and decided to just skip whole rows of stitching. I have no idea why it was doing it. I'd cleaned it, and kept it oiled, and everything.

Ever since yesterday's post, in between drawing, writing and watching Star Trek, I researched, read and thought about my main character's motivation until I believed my brain had effectively melted. I fell asleep thinking about it, woke up thinking about it, had breakfast and made by bed thinking about it, and then sat down at my computer and began to research again.
I’m not saying that there isn’t a fringe or radical left wing, but they don’t seem to have as much money/as many lobbyists/ or frankly as much organization. And I’m also not advocating that being a moderate is the right way necessarily, but I am saying that the mainstream of American voters seems to be rather moderate. I guess the conclusion here is that while I have been frustrated with Romney for being disingenuous I also know that he is having to simultaneously coalesce and combate the most powerful fringe in the nation, and I don’t envy him for that…

For this year, I’ve decided to try my hand in teaching (or tutoring). If you look at all four of my yearbooks, you won’t see the words “teacher” or “teaching” associated with my name, and not in the same sentence with “ambition”, “dream” or “most likely to become”. No one saw me as a teacher. Even now, when I can proudly wear the title “Teacher”, really, I’d rather be called as “Miss”. Maybe it takes a lot of getting used to…

Here we are in April already and rapidly marching toward May! The Sewing, Knitting and Craft Workshop is already nearly 3 weeks behind me now. It was my first time attending an event such as this and I must say that I had great fun! I presented 6 demo's on Gift Wrapping Techniques and 1 on Ribbon Tying and was delighted at the response. I must have demo'ed to nearly 150 enthusiastic ladies who all seemed to enjoy themselves very much.
Those who do value pearls, of course, don’t want to wait around for years and years to find an often imperfectly-shaped or too-small pearl. There is money to be made. So scientists manufacture cultured pearls. Carefully,they pry open the brittle lips of a live oyster and insert special beads to “grow” pearls. These are, of course, less expensive, but no less beautiful.

Often the simplest things are the best though. Hong Lin is famous for its boh lou bau or pineapple buns – named because the texture of their sugary coating resembles the skin of the fruit. Freshly baked, these warm soft buns, covered with their crumbly and crisp sugary topping, really melt in your mouth.

On side two the quality slides slightly, but it still rewards repeated listening. Have A Good Time is a better example of Bishop's good-time, laid back slacker vibe. Wings Of A Bird is Baker's big showcase, and she more than lives up to it. A slinky soul, slow-building ballad with a tasty Bishop guitar lead makes it a keeper for sure. Old Man Trouble finds Jo back at the microphone for a stomping soul-blues that reminds of the present-day Dap Kings, funky middle section and sax break included. Out Behind The Barn is saved by the New Orleans-styled horn charts, and the live instrumental Stomp is a hot guitar jam.

Umm . . . most of them? I know that you have to make changes when bringing a book to life on the screen. But when I cannot understand WHY the changes were necessary, I don’t like it. The first thing that comes to mind is “The Secret of Nimh,” loosely based on Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH, one of the best children’s books ever. WHY was her name changed to Mrs. Brisby in the movie? Why did the rats look like terrifying otherworldly creatures instead of, you know, rats?

I'm inclined to agree with him that many older and grown unschoolers seem to be pretty into academics, though that might just be my perception. Because there have definitely been times when I've felt a bit out of place, or really self-conscious at the very least, because of my lack of interest in more academic pursuits, when among, or in discussions online about, older unschoolers. It does sometimes seem like most unschoolers hit a certain age, and go all academic suddenly, and like maybe I just missed that. Was it supposed to happen? Am I lacking something? Will people think less of me?? So says my insecure self, though I know it's unlikely either that I'm missing anything or that people will think any less of me for it!
The asylum seeker attacked Christine Mackay with a kitchen knife as she slept, cutting through her tendons and almost severing her thumb and causing her to lose four pints of blood.
With Verm suffering another setback, it’s high time AW the Alchemist makes Miquel’s promotion to the first team permanent. Besides AW the Alchemist is renowned for giving chances to younglings at the club. If he could hand youngling Movie superstar Tom Cruise a debut against Olympiakos in Athens, I believe that Miquel should be given a chance to stake his claim for a place in the team. Koscielny is out with a back problem so Djourou will be in need of a new partner. It’s up to AW the Alchemist to decide whether its the Squisha or young Miquel.

Thought I would let you know about some of the newest Vintage Christmas Music CDs that I just released this year. I am really excited about them.
Soups and stews are my favorite meals to make during the winter season. They are so perfect for this lazy period of hibernation, as most of the time all you have to do is prep all your ingredients and throw them into a pot to simmer for an extended period of time, while your house not only warms up but saturates itself with the aroma of whatever you’ve been cooking. It’s amazing. One of my favorite stew recipes I tried out last year is a vegetarian one, actually, that’s filled with delicious veggies like squash and kale. It’s a little more involved, as you have to chop up everything and do a little roasting first, but it’s all definitely worth it in the end. And the beans make it oh so hearty too. I can’t wait to try it again with my new dutch oven I got for Christmas (I wouldget a dutch oven…)
I love my Enviro Cloths. The fact that it has replaced nearly every cleaner I could need has saved me so much money. I know that it is so much better for the environment as well not putting anything down the drain. Better for my health as well to not have my house contaminated with cleaner residues or inhaling their fumes. The cloths' effectiveness continues to impressive me each time I use it as well, so I am not sacrificing cleaning power. Plus, it is incredibly durable. I know I will be able to continue to use my same original cloths years from now (and it's guaranteed with a warranty).

Hello and happy Saturday stamping friends. If you came by to see this weeks Our Daily Bread Designs Shining the Light Challenge, you are in the right place. I will share with you my version of this weeks super fun challenge.
She listened to Jessica's feet pounding on the stairs and then heard the beep of the alarm as she opened and closed the door.
“Mom, I want to stay here tonight. I can’t go home,” I managed to choke out through the tears.
The past year has been amazing. I've made so many connections and formed friendships I didn't think were possible to make without actually "meeting" someone, which made this decision very difficult. I've decided to take an extended break from my blog so that I could dedicate time to some other writing projects I've been wanting to try. I don't know if I'll be successful or if I'll even complete those goals, but at 30, I want to give it a shot.
To mark the premiere of the new restoration of Metropolis and its 25 minutes of previously lost material, Gabriel Thibaudeau, celebrated pianist and composer for the Cinémathèque québécoise—who premiered his original score for Robert Flaherty’s Nanook of the North at TIFF 2005—was commissioned to create a new score for Fritz Lang’s science-fiction masterpiece. Debuted this past summer at Montreal’s Fantasia International Film Festival, this new score brings two chamber orchestras to the stage to express the class struggle at the heart of the film: a soaring string quintet and keyboard represent the elitist spirit of the city, a booming brass quintet with organ embodies the surging power of the subterranean workers, with the two worlds linked through percussion.
When I graduated from middle school, I applied for the special school, and was denied. My grades were not up to their standards, so they would not be allowing me to attend. I was pissed to say the least; I found my classes boring, and easy. I slacked off because I already knew what my teachers had to say, and my grades reflected it. I talked to my school counselor about it. She and I had become fairly friendly over the years, having been in her office multiple times, for not getting along with other students. She understood my problem, and offered to help me re-apply with her recommendation, and I contacted my old teacher for another recommendation. The school decided that I was at least worth interviewing, and allowed me to come and discuss why I belonged in their school. I must have done well because they accepted me on the spot.
Why don't you invite me along,

I'm late for Daring Cards again this week. having been working away meant that a lot of work at home had to be squeezed into a few days. Kathy chose the theme of Sportsman and I hope that Motor Racing counts - even though it consists of a bloke sitting in a car and going round in circles.

Let’s start with the obvious, here: Being gay has nothing to do with your parenting. You won’t “turn” your kids gay, and you can’t “cure” them of it. It’s not a choice. If you’re unsure on that, I presume you consider yourself straight. Ask yourself: Am I tempted by the allure of sex with someone of my gender? That should clear up any lingering confusion. (Or, perhaps, it confuses you more…)
Personally I am head over Heeeels for their "Sweet Cream & Cookies" Flavor- maybe it sounds simple and not as exciting as some of their other creations.. but it is PERFECTION.

Then I sewed it all together with my serger. If you don't have one then use a zig zag stitch with your sewing machine. First...the shoulder pieces from the front and back pieces. Next where the arms fit onto the shoulders, then sew under the arms together down through the sides of the robe (make sure to add the little loops in the waist area for the tie to go through)

Up until striving to live a zero waste lifestyle, visits to far away places have opened my eyes and provided me with tolerance for cultural differences. These voyages have expanded my general knowledge from which I feed on a daily basis and share with you on this blog - unknowingly, you actually profit from my prior travels;). And I wish the same for my kids in their future. I wish for modern technology to find sustainable alternatives to a transportation mode that I do not foresee disappearing. Some think that I am unrealistic dreaming of a world free of food packaging, I think it is unrealistic to dream of a world free of air travels. With the multicultural civilization that we have become, there is no turning back. Air travel is not going away and I can undeniably say that it will always be part of my family's bi-cultural life.
As part of a proud and enthusiastic community of new female game developers, Lee hopes that through the examples of herself and her counterparts other women will come forward and get involved with gaming. “It’s not just about changing games. It’s about changing culture, which is informed by media such as games,” says Lee. “Challenging sexism in the design of games and the makeup of the industry won’t just diversify gaming; it will shake up our cultural consciousness and gender inequity in the wider world”.
I give up! I have to comment on the general situation…
Thirty minutes later, the chicken was done and it was time to convince the house full of Little Explorers to stop moving for five seconds and at least eat a bite before running off to play again. About that time, it started raining. Good thing we went with Plan B—I don’t want to grill outside in a monsoon! Just as the grown ups started filling their plates, it happened. It started with Mrs. Livingstone and I putting chicken on our plates and saying, “Did you feel that mist coming down from the ceiling?” The next thing we knew, Mr. Livingstone and Mr. Washington had sprung into action, grabbing the “Waterfall Preparedness Kit” aka, buckets, (leftover from this crisis the other night)stacked in the corner and shoving them under the stream of water coming in from the skylight. All the gentlemen got the table and chairs out of the way and got buckets set up while we moved the Little Adventurers upstairs for movies and the grown ups into the family dining room to eat.
There’s nothing really wrong with Randling except that there’s nothing all that right with it either. This is the show they want people to get excited about so they tune in and stick around for the rest of their line-up but there’s really nothing to it. It just shows what a mediocre state the ABC is in at the moment that a kind-of okay quiz show involving lots and lots of puns is their big bet. The ABC want a show that encourages people to stick around and watch their quirky, niche comedy programs afterwards and yet they’ve never thought of kicking things off with a nice broad sitcom instead of a quiz show where people guess whether the name Arnold belonged to a Saint or a Cyclone. That said, Randling is a somewhat fitting starting point to a typically mediocre Wednesday night of new comedy on ABC – things do improve from here but only slightly.

Jo joined me as normal this morning to share another Funday Monday here at Sewing by Annie's. We always start our morning measuring and cutting any curtains as you know but today....wahoooooo we had none to do so we had a catch up and then decided to spend our time sewing for Africa :-) The lovely Di sent us a pretty pink floral quilt cover and toning pink sheet a while back to make into little dresses but as we were both having a catch up with other sewing jobs at that time it had been put into our store for future use. We decided today was the day to make use of it so we chatted over the colour combos and the pieces were cut out ready. Jo has since made the 3 pretty little dresses and I'm sure will do a show and tell over on her blog later.
Yet the explanation is simple, and it is encouraging. A certain percentage are trying very hard to remain ethical creatures of intelligence. Some of our people are remembering the United States of America and those things for which it stands, despite that their homeland is tread upon by resident enemies, and that some of these have been successful in tearing down it’s beloved structure and in killing thousands of its citizens. While it is difficult to put any stock in a trust of no torture (WHO can be trusted these days?), it should still be the preferred idea that no land’s government should resort to severe tactics of physical or mental anguish of captives. There still need to be leaders in the realm of peace and good will in operation.

Now, I've written here before about what a people person my father was, how gregarious and charming he could be with others. And he wasn't looking for a confrontation per se. He just wanted to talk to Eric and Patrick. And he did.

Despite running through a town, the river is very much alive, as evidenced by the sighting of large fish – which I take to be trout – calmly lurking in the flow. The road crosses the river by an ancient (though modified) bridge, today known as the Clattern Bridge. A reference in an old document to what was then called the “Clateryngebrugge” suggests that the name is onomatopoeic, deriving from the clattering noise made by the hooves of horses crossing the bridge.

Mrs. Ronald Reagan, another fashion icon, comes for a visit. Notice the huge blue and white pot, the jib door, the beautiful fireplace and mirror. I wonder what Mrs. Reagan thinks when she comes back – they must be bittersweet memories since her husband is no longer here to enjoy it with her. I also wonder about the china – do you think this is the china that Mrs. Reagan designed? That would have been such a sentimental touch. I wonder if Mrs. O has designed their china yet.

Its been a little wild. We left this morning after only a few days notice and tried really hard to tie up all the loose ends between work and packing everything we need for ourselves and the boys. Its been so fun, so stressful, and so exciting.

In December, at a public meeting in Westminster organised by SPUC, Mrs Clarke spoke out about her worries regarding sex education in schools. She said that her son’s behaviour changed radically for the worse after he was exposed to sex education at school. Mrs Clarke, who also runs a charity for child sex abuse victims, said that sex education puts children in a vulnerable position because the material used is basically paedophilic.
We spent time together as a family attending quite a few of the festivities and as well as some time at the beach. I even got in a bit of shopping....I'll post more photos later this week!

I ordered a few things, including eyelashes (I forgot to take pictures of them, but I will be wearing them soon enough), Liz Lisa replica heels and some clothing pieces, usually my orders were always full of Lolita items, but this is a really nice change, I love everything (。⌒∇⌒)。 and I can wear it in day to day life too! I really hope they're gyaru suitable!
There are days when ideas for a post, or perhaps even just something to talk about, come thick and fast. The thing is though, it's not so much the raw generation of ideas.... well, actually, that's not 100% true and I dare say that if you're like me, you look out of the window, sigh to yourself and wonder how you're going to fill the white space of the input form. Okay, moving on from that, if I do have something to discuss, it's how to start it. Sometimes I get hung up on just saying hello, whereas other times - like now - a stream of consciousness bursts forward to fill the t'interwebs with fluff live and direct from the back of my head. :-)

The judiciary is not immune from a shrinking staff. Since 2008, the Massachusetts Trial Court has had a strict hiring freeze that has not only prevented the expansion in the number of positions, but has also kept positions vacant when staff leave. Today, there are 1,316 fewer court employees than in July 2007.

*Best moment this week?: Having my family come in town...with more on the way...has been a great feeling. My brother is here all the way from Tokyo, Japan, my dad and step mom are coming in from Tennessee, and my in laws have been here helping me get everything ready for Tuesday's big delivery. I am so blessed to have such a wonderful support system...I even have sweet friends who want to be at the hospital when this little guy is born. Such an amazing feeling!
I think it might be time for a clean up lol. I lost my bone folder in the frenzy and had to resort to a tongue depressor that came with a set of rub-ons lol. The yellow thread to the far left is leftover from the blanket I sewed for one of my nephew's Christmas present.

The other aspect that hasn’t been thought through – at all and by either side of the coin – is the base fact that I-Tunes (and Amazon and others of that ilk) are all not just region specific but are at the mercy of the licensors.
The Lord has given me the wonderful privilege of being married to my wife, Keri, for nearly 9 years. I know God loves me because he has given her to me ’til death do us part. Life with her just keeps getting better, but because I know putting up with me and being a mother to our three kids is like having four full-time jobs, I want to offer up this prayer to our God on her behalf.

In a frenzy of delicate macaron making for the sudden rush of orders I recieved, I also recieved an order for a birthday cake...and it proved to be a tough one! I had many restrictions. The cake had to NOT include any nuts, coffee, chocolate, or cheese. Bummer!...hence, I had to surrender to the goddess of Flora and Fauna. It took me about 5 minutes of deep thought to come up with something which would taste fabulous, yet not contain any of the taboo ingredients.
That’s why Brizard must become much more accessible to teachers, by holding regular forums for teachers where they can quiz him directly on his ideas, and by sending regular e-mail updates. He needs to listen to teachers; most likely he’ll get some good ideas.

Although I was new to the Diablo games I felt that needed to read a quick synopsis of the storyline from a wikia to get a handle on what was going on. After playing through the first act I soon realized I didn’t have to know any of the lore previously, because Blizzard has done an amazing job of summarizing some major plot points into early parts of the game. There are even lore tidbits available through scrolls found in dungeons. Adding scrolls of lore, like Lachdanan’s scrolls retelling the story of the Black King’s descent into madness, brings the lore fanatic in me more into the Diablo universe. Blizzard does an amazing job of subtly rewarding players for just experiencing the game, it really brings up the replay value. I cannot wait to play the full version of Diablo 3 when it comes out May 15th.
Don’t get me wrong. It takes all sorts and there’s certainly a place for titilation within advertising games, much like it is within sports and movies. The problem here is that it’s always done in such a classless manner that it ends up excluding potential consumers. In future, publishers should try and use their promotional materials to introduce and excite new customers, not just pander to the whims of the ‘safest demographic’.
The bad news?

I suppose I must have done a lot of research but it never felt as though I was “working”. I was simply following my own interests and the inspiration for the book sprang from those. The hardest thing perhaps was reading Father Reinartz’s articles about the Steinfeld glass. Like the legends of Bad Münstereifel, which I researched for my previous book, they were published in the Eifel Club newsletter in the early twentieth century – which means that they were printed in a terrible Gothic type that is really hard to read, and the language was quite old-fashioned. Obviously the articles were entirely in German too, so it was a bit of a labour of love.

The article that inspired the band name Evanescence, also inspired me to make up the song Like a Virgin which Madonna was approached to record. The lyrics were directly inspired by the first paragraph of the October 1, 1983 article by Frank Rich in the New York Times. They were also inspired by the fact that I was a 15 year old virgin when Joe Elliott of Def Leppard discovered me. This is also why I made up the song “Goody Two Shoes” performed by Adam Ant.

Separated from her lover, writer Philip Parker (Byrne), and presumed dead, Kate is rescued by Nina Tsvetkova (Olga Sutulova), a female member of the Leningrad militia.

Prescription drugs, whether they are painkillers, anti-depressants, or any other drug can be dangerous when taken recreationally or if one takes more than the recommended dosage. Studies show that if the pattern of use remains steady and unhealthy, it could potentially lead to addiction. Adults are more likely to succumb to this because they have the resources, whether they have insurance or the extra money to pay for it. Doctors prescribe these pills on a much looser basis; for example, a strong prescription drug called Topamax can be distributed if a patient complains of constant migraines. A young student, who requests to remain anonymous, recalls watching her mother taking more than her prescribed doses:
Hi Readers — Those of you who have read my book know there’s a chapter called, “Fail! It’s the New Succeed!” The idea being that when we let kids fail, they learn that it’s not the end of the world and this is a great lesson, even though it’s very painful (for parents. And kids, too, I guess.)

Reports on bullying in schools (you might have found on a government website) indicate that particularly 9-12 year old children are affected. You might have discovered that physical bullying between children is the most severe form in schools. Therefore you decide to raise awareness within that age group and demonstrate the effects to them because that will help children to understand their actions towards others . The visual language you will be using now needs to correspond to the age group, e.g. colours, type, images need to be ‘readable’ (semiotics!). You might choose to portray three children from different ethnic backgrounds to highlight that bullying can happen to all of them not just particular groups, etc. etc.

Although these digital platforms have amazing technology, it is the news brands that have reach, and many of the news publications that have entered this space have found an additional revenue line. In fact, in terms of ROI, a digital presence is a very profitable proposition; there is no need to spend on distribution or newsprint and there are no overhead costs. A digital presence also opens up the opportunity to exploit content in various forms. Newspapers are combining video, text, audio, images and a lot more to make their online stories as engaging as possible.

Okay so here is my Easel card, I spotted this little chap over at Sassy Cheryl's and just had pop him in my basket!! I got very close to chopping the top of his hat off, I started of with completely different papers but I didn't like them so I decided to change them but I had already matted him up and then that didn't go so I had it cut it down, phew close shave!
With the first sip, I had a revelation. A light went on. It wasn’t that I didn’t like coffee. I just didn’t like BAD coffee. It wasn’t the coffee that was terrible, it was my family’s low expectations for it. The truck stops, drive-ins and Waffle Huts were to blame, not my taste buds! Begone, Maxwell House of Horrors! Farewell, foul Folgers!
An electronic newspaper, Al-Marsad, reported that more than 1000 visitors watched the process of crowning of "a child beauty queen 2010" at the festival in Mecca, called Makkah Khair.
This weekend has been jam packed- just how I like it. Thursday and Friday were spent preparing for the baby shower I threw Friday evening for one of my besties. She had mentioned a while back that she found a cute little sail boat at a second hand store for the nursery, so it sparked the idea of a nautical theme for her shower. I didn't want anything too cheesy (like many store-sold baby shower decorations are) and wanted to use things that she would be able to actually use for her new little munchkin. Here's what we ended up with:

After all, stories about futuristic scifi, vampires and ghosts would have never been written if we steadfastly stuck to 'what we know'. And writers like Stephen King and Dean Koontz would be drawing unemployment checks!
I still remember when I was a little kid, birthdays were always something magical to me.
I made these meringue mushrooms for Irini's Fairy Garden Party, but they would also be great for a woodland or ladybug themed party. I saw them originally on Pinterest, here, and figured they couldn't be too hard, and in the end, not only did they looked amazingly realistic, they were very easy to make. The only thing I would change would be to use milk chocolate rather than dark chocolate. They were a huge hit, and were the first thing to be completely gobbled up!
The fight between pro-slavery and anti-slavery activists as to whether Kansas would become a slave state or a free state was one of the early confrontations that triggered the Civil War. Popular vote would decide whether or not Kansas would become a free state. Large groups of both pro- and anti-slavery activists poured into Kansas to decide the outcome, which at times escalated into violent confrontations, and many of these battles were centered in and around Lawrence. Finally, on January 29, 1861, Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state, less than three months before the Battle of Fort Sumpter which began the Civil War.
Instead of spending half a billion dollars getting hundreds of thousands of kids ready for something they might be physically incapable of doing (like sitting still), why not send out a message to all of their schools? The message could be really simple, and would not be expensive to distribute. I'll even save them the trouble of paying someone to write it up:

Begin by eating healthier. I want to encourage you to eat citrus fruits at this time, mango, lemon (squeezed in water or tea), oranges, grapefruit and lime. Lemons have especially high vibrations and are cleansing both for the physical and astral realm. You really can’t go wrong adding a little lemon to your diet right now.
so there you have it, I'm an imperfect mommy, that does not cherish every minute, (just most minutes). I'm so thankful for the grace and strength that God gives to make it through each day.
I’m basically obsessed with organization. Organizing my color according to color? You know it. Matching bins and baskets to organize belts, scarves, and socks? Could you expect anything less? To-do lists? Can’t live without them.

8. Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels: (First aired 1977, ran until 1980) This series can be accurately described as a cartoon take off of Charlie's Angels. After being set free by the Teen Angels from a block of glacier ice, Captain Caveman emerged as the world's first superhero. Along with the three Teen Angels, the Captain solves crimes with his super strength and an endless assortment of gadgets that he keeps hidden in his caveman fur. Even after the Captain's own superhero days had ceased, he continued to make appearances in other shows and was featured in The Flintstone Comedy Show, the Flintstone Kids, Robot Chicken, and a few others. Who says our Stone Age brethren can't make it in the modern day?
Frustration apart, I would like to take a look with you on this ‘monkey’ survey offered at a publisher’s blog. The blogpost is very good I have to say, it’s smart and asks the right questions, I don’t want to talk about that, I want to take a look at the survey, not at the questions, which are also good, but at the responses. I chose just a few of them.
The voices of reason which pleaded that Mbeki be allowed to complete his term, perhaps bringing the election date forward, were drowned out by the angry voices of the night.

Top comment from RomasRedesigns on YouTube:
In between elections the poor get very little mention and there is good reason for that. Firstly, they are not particularly economically active which means that they don't count. Let me give you an African wildlife metaphor. When an impala is born and is found to be weak the rest of the herd don't run around starting action groups with like minded caring impala to protect the weak of the herd. The poor lame hobbling impala is left to fend for itself and it's inability to run faster than other impala of a similar age is just part of the process of natural selection. The lame and the sick end up on the dinner menu of the predators. And it's not all rosy for the predators either. If a lion cannot hunt for himself he is reduced to scrounging the scraps from other lion kills. The chances are that he will be driven away by younger healthier lions and will become thinner and thinner before dropping from sheer starvation and exhaustion and providing food for the vultures. Who said it was a fair world? We are the only species that protect the weak with such enthusiasm and the result has had a substantial effect on the quality of the gene pool.

In considering the above, it's important to note that most Soviet communists were Russians, and that most Jews were not communists. However, given the relative proportions of the population that were Russian and Jewish, that would almost necessarily be true. But in general communism was seen as being "good for the Jews", and that accounts for the large number of Jews who advanced to leadership positions within the Party.

It’s beyond bad; classrooms full of kids who are, on average, 2-3 grade levels behind their grade level in most any subject, behavioral issues, anger, violence as a basic way life – we see all of that and more, every day. It was true with the fifth and eighth graders I spent last year with, the classes of fifth graders my wife has shepherded through two years at the same school, for most of our TeachNOLA and Teach for America peers that we have bonded with.

There is a guy who is friends with one of my roommates, and he usually just lets himself into our suite when my roommates prop the door open. It bothers me because one, he is an obnoxious person to begin with. Two, who does he think he is letting himself in like that? Three, one time I was heading back to my suite, and he was waiting at the door. Once I opened the door, he just walked in like he owned the place.
I guess we have Jeremiahs now in the pagan community. If they want to go doom and gloom that’s fine with me but they really need to grow up. The “End Times” is a stupid and hopeless concept that does no good for anyone and because it IS hopeless. It’s a convenient excuse not to try and change things. Humans have been predicting the “End Times” since time began and it hasn’t happened yet, whether it be Revelations or Ragnarok.

The daughter who herself has sever health problems grudgingly looks after them and leaves no opportunity to humiliate and scold them. The only reason she is bearing with them , as per her, is the property in her father’s name. Every day is a struggle to survive for them. My therapist goes daily to help them and the stories she narrates are horrifying. Many a times she intervenes but is told to stay away from family matters.
Tonight our daughter and her gang will be over with Lily and I know we'll take photos then-so more to come.

Anyhoo, in the summer, her coach had them up at 5 am every morning to swim. 5 am. 5-fricking-am. In the morning. Sometimes she’d get up, swim in the morning and be back home before I was even up to go to work. Since she was also in the marching band she sometimes had band practice over the summer too, and would have to go back for 4 hours practices in the afternoons. Compared to her, I felt like my 12-hour, 6-day work week at my summer theme park job was like vacationing in the Keys. It was nuts.
I think it might have been last week when I started to think about him and asked myself, “if he wanted to get back together, would you?” My answer, without much thought, was “no, no way”. There’s been way too much that has happened. I didn’t think he treated me with the respect I deserved toward the end. He said some things that were pretty mean to me. I don’t and won’t forgive that.

The Dr. came to check on me and showed me what my cervix looked like after the surgery - and it was astounding. The difference was huge! I was amazed and overjoyed, and was told that my cervix is now the strongest part of my uterus - earning it the nickname "the steel fortress" from me.

For a while there, it looked like the end of the world. You couldn’t kill a zombie with bullets or knives or poison. A samurai sword through the spleen did nothing. Running them over with a semi did slow them down, but not for long. Thanks to the mutation, the undead felt almost no pain and healed almost immediately. They were almost indestructible.

The first minute or two of a patient’s first appointment with me is always the most telling. In these first few minutes I begin to get a sense of what the patient expects out of their time with me. Some don’t know what to expect, as they have never been to a physical therapist before. Some have seen a physical therapist before and had either a good or bad experience. That expectation is at times brought with them when they see me. The hardest type of expectations for me to deal with are those of a patient who has a preconceived notion of what physical therapy is and expects to be treated in that way, whether it is a notion that I agree with or not. Some my patients have no expectations at all, as this is their first time in physical therapy. Their doctor told them to go but that is all they know.
Not perhaps the most encouraging introduction to your guide but it is at least honest (he does also give an early get out clause to those wearied by his dark digressions - 'Besides, anyone who wants to stop reading this account may do so now. He should know immediately that he has my unqualified permission.') and fair warning for what is to follow. To describe Castel as an unsympathetic narrator would be an understatement, in fact he's so unpleasant that it may stop some people from enjoying the book at all. He first sees the woman he will kill at an exhibition of his own work. She spends some time looking at a painting and in particular a detail in one corner of a solitary woman staring through a window at the sea. Then all of a sudden she is gone and Castel is left dejected, miserable and forever altered. Having not taken the opportunity to speak to her how can he hope now to find this stranger amongst all of the inhabitants of Buenos Aires. What follows is a rather hilarious section in which he hopes to bump into her again, haunting his own exhibition, hoping for a chance meeting in the street, all the while paralysed by his own insecurity and all the scenarios he has played out in his head. Eventually they do meet again and what follows are a series of tense, enforced meetings where Castel's fervour is always at the highest pitch as he seeks to convey why Maria is so important to him and his work.

The horrendous difficulties the state will encounter in trying to restore and maintain order notwithstanding, the army is still the only tool it will have at its disposal when it attempts to do so.

My stepdaughter came to me seeking help. It was an obvious ploy on her part. Looking back, there was no mistaking in her gestures and words the message I was to receive. So, I sought help for her, only to be rebuffed by her biological mother, who insisted “all is fine”. And, as the biological mother, she has that right, at least how things are currently set up.
Pin them on to see where you like the placement best. One thing you also need to keep in mind is how heavy the body of the top/dress is. If you made this dress length, the body will be heavier and stretch the shirred straps more than you might think they would. So you would need to adjust for that when you pin the straps on. This is a hard thing to get perfect if you are doing it without the one who will wear it by your side. But you can. Just hang it on a hanger and pull on it yourself until you think it feels right. Sorry that's pretty vague but it's a trial and error kind of thing.
Clint always talks about wanting to go golfing in other places besides Northern Utah. I found a pretty cool course before we left and booked a tee time. The course was in Cocoa Beach and was right on the river. When I say river, don't picture the Provo River or the Jordan River like we have in Utah. Rivers there are miles and miles wide and you can't see the current. It almost seems like a really big lake. These rivers, though, are half salt water and half fresh. That means there are some sea animals living in them like dolphins, jelly fish and sting rays. Now that you are schooled in the ways of Florida rivers, maybe you can picture it a little better.

But when I first began planning the wedding I looked at dark purple for the bridesmaid dresses, flowers, etc. and was looking at a more traditional look. But as I did some research and began really looking at what it was going to look overall I didn’t like the matchy-matchy thing. I didn’t like the shades of purple that I found either, I began to see that purple wasn’t really going to work for me. The more I thought about it the more I realized I wanted my bridesmaids to look beautiful and feel comfortable, as well as be able to afford the bridesmaid dress. I also realized the traditional look wasn’t working for me. It just didn’t feel right.

They have done neither! Which tell me two things. One is that they obviously like their course the way it is – and a beautiful course it is. And two, they obviously felt that they would never be in the position of having a record set. After all, since 2000 the average winner at Boston ran in the 2:10:00 range and until 2010 the course record was only 2:07:14.

Despite the upsurge in global mineral prices, there has been a mild recession in South Africa over the past few years.

What do these results prove? It would seem safe to conclude that were Ken Dodd to choose to stand any of his Diddy Men at the next round of local elections, they would be sure to beat the BFP. Neither however, could beat this party here.
Technically, this is hard to do. Amazon has grown large while staying fairly consistent as an organization, but most big companies got big through acquisition, and that makes synchronizing data a massive chore. Getting targeted information in front of the person who’s dealing with an individual customer, or designing for one, is still a low priority. Customer service in its various forms is still treated as an expense to be minimized, not an opportunity to be developed.

It is up to us, then, brothers and sisters, to choose to follow Jesus’ directives in order to activate our faith to receive the Blessings of the Cross and Resurrection in Faith and not let the circumstances of our lives and past mistakes deprive of the spiritual Liberty and Freedom that is our heritage.

At home, we reluctantly allowed C to do two things: eat his meals away from the family table (on a desk in our kitchen, facing away from the rest of us) and wear his ear buds with his music playing during meals so he couldn't hear us. This has helped a bit; he does inhale his entire plate of food in like 90 seconds so he can get away from us entirely, but at least he's in the room with us up until then so we still have the barest illusion of family mealtime. We've learned that the only real medical treatment for misophonia so far is anti-anxiety medication, but since C is only 15 and has a lot of weird issues with medication like I do (strange side-effects, etc.) we wanted to try something gentler first, so I bought him some nutritional supplements for anxiety that seemed to take the edge off somewhat. He's been taking two before school every day and for a while they seemed to get him through with just a baseline anxiety -- not as many spikes. However, the supplements aren't really working so well anymore.

Similar episodes of unprovoked violence by young black gangs against white people chosen at random on beaches, in shopping malls or in other public places have occurred in Philadelphia, New York, Denver, Chicago, Cleveland, Washington, Los Angeles and other places across the country.

That is, the movers and shakers choose to ignore the obvious when faced with the media. In private, they’re perfectly well aware of how bloody it’s going to get.

In 1837, she was one of the organizers of the Anti-Slavery convention of American Women. The following year, on May 15, the convention met in Philadelphia in the newly constructed Pennsylvania Hall. When the sessions were disturbed by an anti-abolitionist mob, it was Mrs. Mott who exhorted the women to remain calm. During the evening of May 17 the building was set afire & burned to the ground. While the hall was burning, the mob stated toward the Motts’ home on North Ninth Street, where the family sat quietly, awaiting the worst; fortunately the crowd was diverted before reaching the destination.
Haha, relax. I am not trying to kill myself. But this post is and I am sure so will you after you read it. You see, a few months back, in my usual alcoholic escapades, I met a guy who narrated to me his story. He told me how he had been looking for a job and how when he was about to give up all hope, he finally landed one as a Shamba Boy. It wasn’t a prestigious job per se, but the benefits that supposedly came with it were incredible. The job was simple; tend to the little garden at a guy’s house for Ksh 20,000 per month. If he showed his commitment by staying on the job for at least a year and a half, he would get a car and a house. Not bad for a Shamba Boy, right? Sadly, he quit before he even started the job. In my head, he was a dumb ass; in Kenya getting a job with a tax-free salary and guaranteed job security is a hustle. Then the story got nasty…
Today I will show you how I'm usually stretching my all white doilies. After making it, it must be washed in some whitening washing powder and to be taken into the starch melted in a cold water.

English National Ballet’s Dance Artist encouraged participants to feel their bodies being pulled simultaneously in different directions and to perform jumps with the heavy, pounding-into-the-floor feeling of the choreography. “The Rite of Spring is not pretty in any way – it’s angry and aggressive.” Ballet-trained participants struggled to master the tricky style but were kept thoroughly amused throughout class as they attempted to transform themselves into a sacrificial tribe.

Last weekend I went out to Brooklyn with a friend. While we looked over a pier at the Manhattan skyline I was struck again by the reality that I’m living in New York City. I feel a little like a cliche. This city is America’s greatest and most enduring celebrity. Of all of the cities I could have gone to for grad school I’ve come to the most typical. But so far it suites me.

You couldn’t find your “naughty” in the mirror because it is buried deep inside your most important sexual organ – your brain. We all hear about people being bored with their sexual lives. If this is your situation, I would suggest that you might want to turn off all devices you own that require electricity and stare off into “naughty space” for about a week. It takes more than love to keep things fresh in the bedroom. It takes imagination! Ask your partner to do the same and then come back together and honestly compare notes. It may take a little courage but it is well worth it!

This week I wanted to highlight one of my favorite contemporary art galleries in Fort Lauderdale – Las Olas Fine Arts.

But gradually, the closer I got to God and the more I learned about the Word and my spirit flourished, I realized it was just as sinful to not take care of myself as it was to not do for others…so I stopped trying to hide, and pretend I didn’t care about things…that I did, I decided that as long as God was pleased with me and my house was in order, I could do things I love, and that there was no harm in taking good care of the one who took care of others…ME~

One study (Gislen et al. 2006) found that European children began unconsciously to constrict their pupils as well after about a dozen underwater training sessions. So the ability appears to be something that can be acquired fairly easily – although Gislen et al. only used 4 European children in their study, so we should be cautious about drawing any strong conclusions just yet.

"Catwoman: Guardian of Gotham" was a two-volume series published in DC's "prestige format" in 1999. It appeared under the "Elseworlds" umbrella, where characters are twisted and changed into something other than what readers are used to seeing them as. (I don't know if DC is still doing these, but from what little I know about what's been going on in the DC Universe in recent years, it ALL sounds like an Elseworlds series.)

What keeps coming back to my mind is this one scene in Sex and the City, where Miranda and Carrie talk about Miranda’s possibly having an abortion after getting pregnant by accident in the middle of her 30s. Miranda says something like: “What if this is my baby? My one and only chance? What if I have an abortion and will never get pregnant again? I simply have to have this baby.” This is exactly how I’m feeling: this is my baby, my one and only chance.

My sister may have left this world fourteen years ago, but it would not be the only time I would lose her. I had a journey to take – a path of grief to follow, one of which I had skipped lightly around in the year after her passing. It was this same year that my muse became active. Flooding my head with stories, and while I lightly entertained them I made no serious move to do anything about them. Not until they started yelling at me a decade later! I guess they didn’t take lightly to being ignored. Talking to me every waking moment, giving me no peace at any time of the day or night.
I can't believe it has been months since I have written and the only excuse I have to offer is that life has bends and twist and I have been on a twisting path finding it difficult sometimes to find home.

Make no mistake, I’ve enjoyed a lot of books in my lifetime. I would say that I enjoy the majority of the books I read, and I read a lot of books. But it’s a rare thing to discover an author whose voice moves me, whose thinking challenges me, whose writing taps into a sort of “Yes! That’s true!” that has me using exclamation points (and I don’t use exclamation points; I think they’re lazy). Dostoevsky does this for me. Dietrich Bonhoeffer. David Foster Wallace. Still, it’s not the sort of thing that happens every day.

We follow a meandering route through Isabella, around Still Pond, its pink and purple backdrop reflected in the water, and along and over streams (passing an Acer palmatum I remember planting 20 years ago) to Thomson’s Pond. The adjacent lawn features a collection of low hummocky Rhododendron yakushimanum hybrids known as the ‘Seven Dwarfs’, including varieties named ‘Bashful’ and ‘Dopey’! We pass the Bog Garden, looking wonderful, the leaves of Gunnera manicata not yet fully attaining their eventual 2m size, but impressive nonetheless. After a relaxing picnic amongst the trees we follow the perimeter of Peg’s Pond (where the knobbly pneumatophore ‘knees’ of a Dawn Redwood can be seen along the water’s edge) to the gate where we leave the Isabella Plantation.

1. Is it accurate? Earlier in my life, I would have said no, absolutely not. However, now that I’ve seen that it is possible to trust people and since I’ve seen less examples as to why I can’t trust people as I’ve gotten older, I’d have to say that yes, it is accurate.

With the cost of health insurance on the rise, many employers are shopping around for new coverage every year and entertaining plans they would never have considered before. If you are like many Americans who have had health insurance over the years, you have had an HMO or Health Maintenance Organization, at one point or another. You may also have had a PPO or Preferred Provider Plan. But as companies continue to search for health care options that are affordable, you may begin to hear about alternative plans, if you haven’t already.

Second, hand lettering is something at which I’d like to get become more accomplished and incorporate into my art and illustration practice more fully. This project is an opportunity for me to practice in the context of a personal creative challenge.”

For me, the critical difference between Amazon and Apple's iTunes store is that iTunes allows uploads of free books. Amazon supposedly price matches, but only when they feel like it. You can't plan a marketing strategy on the back of somebody else's whim. So Joe is right, when it comes to Amazon: I haven't gotten lucky. Sadly, infuriatingly, 'get lucky' is the only plan available when it comes to Amazon.
Just raising the figure isn’t sufficient, so long as there are corporate slaveholders like Walmart who make everyone “casual” employees. Even when the baboons in Washington rouse themselves to belatedly raise the minimum wage, they stupidly enter a fixed figure in the bill, which quickly falls behind inflation. Under our plan, we will create a minimum wage law that sets the wage as a variable linked to inflation, price indexes, etc. Presto! No need to ever pass another bill!

08. Baby Can Dance (Pts II - IV)
But you see, here’s the thing that is constantly made obvious to me. Many of us carry – to a greater or lesser extent - some kind of pain and trauma. Inevitably it stems from our childhood. Inevitably it was linked to our parents’ or some other’s pain. It finds its roots in pain that has gone on to become accepted childrearing practice - what Alice Miller calls the poisonous pedagogy. It goes on to shape societies and systems of governance. Seldom if ever did we bring the pain upon ourselves – yet we almost always pass it on. So there it is and there we sit with it. What becomes pivotal is how we deal with our pain – if we deal with it - if we are able to deal with it. Either we handle it and heal ourselves from it – and it strikes me that those who do are in the minority – for it takes resources, support, love, courage and fortitude to mine the depths of that which injured us and move on. Or, we pass it on. We may do so by turning it inward or we may vent our spleen on those around us – whether we know them or not. We try to make our issues their issues, we fail to deal with the things that make us ache and instead, like hand grenades, we detonate outwards, spreading and scattering our pain and our fear - through one means or another. And isn’t this perhaps the root of our problems - our and society's failure or inability to take responsibility for personal traumas, issues, baggage - the stuff that we all carry to some extent or another? Of course some might say, “But I didn’t ask for this to happen to me, it’s not my fault, not my responsibility.” Actually, whether you “asked” for it or not, it’s yours and utlimately only you can take the responsiblity - with support and love and care - to deal with it. No one else can. We start with ourselves, with a single step. Perhaps that is indeed the challenge of being human – to acknowledge, call up and accept our pain - personal and collective, to deal with it and our needs and fears, to move beyond and so to stop the rot of the constant spreading of personal trauma and fear. I accept it is not always easy, that circumstances can work against us but perhaps it is a case of to each his/her own level of challenge. I don't know. All I do know is I wish we'd stop hurting others because we are hurt - it makes for far too much of a Catch-22 situation which goes on and on and on...
Things started out comical and fun, but eventually I realized I was laughing less and less and my stomach was hurting more and more. It wasn’t just the harmful stereotyping that pervaded the movie, although that was part of it. Jason Segel’s idea of writing a rom-com seems to involve writing a brutally honest portrayal of all of the real-life crap that tears apart all the relationships of everyone I have ever known. And in the movie, that’s what happens. There were scenes in the movie that hit far too close to home, and even the parts that were genuinely funny couldn’t quite make up for how true to life the bad parts were. It was, as my sister said, like being punched in the face repeatedly.
Last year, my goal for the year was to give more monetary tzedakah. I have always been good at giving time and items, but not so much financially, and while I don’t have the money to give as much as I would really like to be able to – I recognized that if I planned it out, I could give more than I had been. Working for a Jewish non-profit definitely helped me in this way and I feel like I have taken concrete steps towards identifying how I can best give financially and more personally. Both are important, so now I need to find the balance. (And before anyone says it, yes I know that working as much as I do for a Jewish non-profit is a huge gift of tzedakah in reality as well.)
But on what basis does the Bank arrive at its conclusions? Despite studying the 13-page report, I’m afraid the best you’re going to get, is the Bank has used four models to examine actual prices versus expected prices. The expected prices are derived from observations of property prices over the long-term and their relationship to various factors such as average income, population, housing stock and the availability of credit. It seems that on an “affordability” basis, the biggest undervaluation of 26% occurs.

Good strategy requires doing some research. Find out if there is a need or a want for your product and where that market is. Look for the best ways of reaching that market. Set up a goal and the milestones that will mark your way to reaching that goal. Study the formulas devised by marketing gurus and see what has worked and what has not worked for others.

To me, it is really a great idea from a group of NGOs to have mounted the Bersih events so far, to provide all sensible Malaysians who love our country, a platform to demonstrate our hope and desire of what we would like to see constitute a decent government of the day. I do not need fancy ideologies really. No need for “1 Malaysia” from some silly highly paid marketing artists. Just give me a fair and just governing system and I am sure all sensible Malaysians will be happy.
After arranging the sunny yellow tulips in a container and placing it at my husband’s headstone, I begin to talk to my Father. It is a very intimate relationship I have with Him, He knows all about me and my shortcomings, how I miss the mark sometimes, how I fail and disappoint Him. And yet, I still feel free to come to Him and share openly how I feel…and He listens patiently. He is not shocked or surprised when I tell Him I am angry or frustrated. He does not reject me because I am not what we would consider “perfect”. He knows my hurts, my needs and He listens patiently.

Naturally the proposed action doesn’t involve any actual science but rather an expensive full page add in the New York Times newspaper. Brilliant stuff. That’s the kind of thinking that could just win you a Nobel Peace Prize. Just add some Power Point slides and you’re a dead certainty for the now thoroughly debased Peace Prize.

So as you can see, I came up with some cute non 4 legged animals but if you really think about it, it's not easy to come up with many. We did discussed dolphins, but I don't know if I really consider them to be cute. The pink Amazon River dolphins are just plain scary, and I suppose the typical bottle nose dolphin can be kind of be cute, but I usually have to want to snuggle something before I'll consider it truly cute. I don't want to snuggle a dolphin and I actually would be terrified to swim with one because I couldn't even snorkel in a goldfish bowl without freaking out over the fish being near me in the water. I've been to Hawaii twice and panicked at the sight of even the smallest fish both times when I attempted snorkeling along the shore...I'm quite a pansy. I prefer "urban snorkeling", aka. going to an aquarium.
She served as the assistant town manager for the Town of Danville since 2006. According to the city staff report, Somers oversaw many capital projects during her tenure in Danville; these include a 17-acre community park development, the renovation of the town’s historical Village Theatre and the restoration of its Veterans Memorial Building, just to name a few. Somers’ decision to take up the mantle of the city manager’s position, involved several factors one of which was Los Altos’ small-town atmosphere. Prior to her employment in Danville, Somers spent more than eight years working for the city of Sunnyvale.

So, these are our lives now. For the next five years, Andy and I will be in Chattanooga while Andy becomes a Middle School math teacher (those are going to be some lucky middle schoolers if you ask me). Andy will start his new endeavor at the end of June and I will officially start mine on Monday. What we thought would be a short stop in Chattanooga has become an extended stay. And we are okay with that. The friends we have made here, the sense of community we have been given, give us a peace about prolonging our time here. Maybe we'll even stick around after the five years are up. Who can say? It is baffling enough to have a glimpse of what our lives will likely look like five years from now. No need to look any further at this point.

He had the background, the data, the record, and the inclination, and he has blessed us throughout the eternities for the service he rendered in writing the first five books of the Bible.
"I got an email one day asking me if I'd be interested in having my home in a book. Since I am working on a book of my own, I was thrilled to be included. I have been "in print" many times throughout my long career as a stylist, an event designer, and now as an interior decorator, but this book was especially near and dear to my heart because of the concept Christiane was putting forth.
No one knows this, but that's one of the reasons I love studying at the Caffe Veloce near my place. Each Veloce has a somewhat different soundtrack that plays, but the one closest to where I live plays this wonderful piano music. I never wear headphones when I study there... I'm just so happy to be listening to what they have to offer.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Beat together applesauce, almond paste (might have to break up with fingers), oil, sugar, and agave nectar. Beat in egg and vanilla. Mix well. Mix together flour, baking soda, salt, pepper, and whey powder and add to applesauce mixture. Add oats, fruit, and almonds and mix well.

Part 2: Understanding
When we bump into each other I feel no sorrow, no stir of emotion or anger,
So about an hour late to lunch I finally get to the restaurant and find Addi packing my meal into a to-go box. As I was thanking him Becca informed me that he was mostly trying to cover up the tracks of how much of my fried rice he had eaten. Clever.
Many people still feel intimidated by wine, believing they lack the knowledge to best select a wine. So they seek assistance from someone they believe has the necessary confidence and knowledge, the wine store employee. Other customers might rely upon wine scores or the options of professional wine critics. But many average individuals prefer to rely upon face to face contact, a more intimate situation, with a wine store employee. This is a powerful dynamic, an interaction which can have significant ramifications beyond a single wine sale.
Have you read the novel The Search Committee? It’s a popular pick on resource center discussion groups and blogs, especially in the southeastern part of the country. The author is Tim Owens, a ruling elder from Summerville, South Carolina.
Let's get started.
This prophecy, as stated in the opening paragraph, is believed to have already been fulfilled by some when the Romans conquered Palestine, as recorded in the book of Daniel:
Anyway, Mo really has a way of capturing the joy of childhood, so I happily picked up about 4 or 5 of these images. I hope to have another one colored up in the next day or two.
Either way, fasten your seatbelt as you ride on the Amphibian Flying miracle that is the "Oshun Oxtra" for a thrilling tale of boyhood escapades and growing up thoroughly independent and free. No wonder Moominpappa found life in Moominvalley just a little bit...safe!

I might do it later. And remember you can still send me your fan pictures.
Discreet these Spring mushrooms, but I see them, they can't hide forever.
The Bible doesn’t condemn people for their sexual attractions. The Bible says, “Exchanging natural relations for unnatural ones”. Romans 1:26- Therefore God handed them over to disgraceful diseases, and their females changed their natural need and became accustomed to that which is unnatural. God created men and women to marry each other and have children together. This is how God wants us to express our sexuality!
Pull up a chair, grab a cookie, then hop over to her blog and join in the fun and festivities.
They were suspicious, I thought, as I did as he said. I parked in front of an aluminum-slotted rising door, and keyed the car off. Taking stock, I tried to calculate the risks. I created a checklist of suspicious items on or about my character.
The reason for it's success was in evidence in my bottle of Old Boy. It's a perfect name for this drink. This is an evocative ale, which plays tricks on your memory banks, conjuring up images of memories too far distant to be your own. After a couple of sips, I felt like I'd slid effortlessly back to at least the Edwardian or Victorian era. The coins in my pocket were now farthings, my v-neck sweater was now a smoky tweed jacket, and the kids playing in the street were all foundlings I'd recently rescued from the local workhouse.
Do you see a trend with the verses listed above? Prayer is important. We are to pray for each other. It is powerful and effective. People are praying for you. We are to pray continually. I know that it is important to have a national day of prayer, but it is obvious that God wants us to pray at all times. We, as the Body of Christ, must set the example. We must pray without ceasing.
We also have been working on the garden. We’re a bit behind schedule, for what I would like, but we should be all right in the long run.
I'm embarrased to tell y'all just how much fun it is.

The first is a quick gift card holder that I created for my son to give to the principal on the last day of school.
Anyway, are there any other dating rules you’d like to kick to the curb? Or throw in the trash? Or whatever you youngsters are saying these days?
I had a couple of drams (Bailie Nicol Jarvie for those interested) and watched the lights come on in Windermere and Kendal. Although thin cloud raced not too far above my head, stars soon came into view beyond and I spotted familiar constellations.
Jess thought very hard for a moment. A hug?
We walked back over to pick up the girls around 10pm. We passed right through the middle of Times Square. I forgot how breathtakingly beautiful it is at night. I fit right in with all the tourists as I whipped out my camera and started taking pictures of it. The girls were waiting outside for us and couldn't wait to flash us their show passes. It seemed to draw some attention. Half a dozen girls ran over to them asking how it was and if they got to see the band and how lucky they were. Then out came Leslie Mann (from The Change-Up) who took some pics with fans and jumped right into her awaiting Escalade. We finished the night off with a vanilla ice-cream cone with chocolate crunchies on it from the Mr. Softee truck right there on 50th street by Rockefeller Plaza. The subway home took 15 minutes and B was right right there to pick us up. What a great night!
The title of the book is elegant. As it was explained to me recently, the Rift is a valley in Central Africa. You can Google it for more information. Benaron’s title is an obvious metaphor—an allusion to the Rift Valley, but also a nod to the rift that divided Rwanda (to say nothing of the various rifts in Jean Patrick and his family’s life). Benaron goes deeper with the climate and landscape of Rwanda—she eloquently describes the country. I was struck by how different it is from the stereotypical desert we think of. And by making Jean Patrick a geology student, she ultimately gives him an understanding that though the world changes slowly over centuries, the rocks that we rest upon are lasting, no matter what happens above. Again, the author is subtle with this parallel, and like with classical music, it’s the subtleties that show true talent.
It has been quite a crazy few nights, and I am totally thankful to people who sub stuff!

“It was the biggest a-ha moment of my life. To see how they develop players from seven years of age and on. Going over there was really an epiphany of how to develop into their style of play. We want to develop that here at Cal Poly,” Holocher said.
As we came off the mountain, Virgil realized that he had three hungry women in the truck that he needed to feed quickly! We spent the the last hours of our day at a local restaurant with the best "home-cooked" food that could be found.

Jawdat, a Muslim, was sent back to his home in Israel on Friday evening after officials in the exchange program he was enrolled in told him he had been dismissed over the incident, which occurred about a month earlier.

It's not really so very different, I find. I'm not aware of writing in a different way for younger people, though I suppose the language is more of a challenge and you have to be aware of what's acceptable and what's not. Like many children's authors, I struggle with the dialogue, trying to give it an up-to-date flavour without including expressions that would quickly date.
After several weeks of discomfort, trepidation, frustration and uncertainty, I’ve finally received good news.
But I like to have my X-Files fantasies, anyway.
Inspired by a comment asking for my advice on where to have a bachelorette party within walking distance of the Sausalito Ferry Terminal, I decided to take Dad to Horizons last night when he wanted to have dinner 'by the water'. I also had visited earlier but with such spotty quality photos that it wasn't enough to make a good post. So I'm combining last night's visit with Dad with some prior unpublished photos for a mega-review of the food and views of Horizons. And Lynda can take a look (if this post is still in time!) to see for herself which dishes look the best!

Christmas eve and Christmas day were filled with an abundance of excitement and joy! And, then I thought about it from Jacob's perspective. When we found out about this little soul that would be joining our family we received some pictures of him. In the pictures he held stuffed animals and played with a big semi truck. However, when we received him he didn't come with any of these things. Then, to come into our house, already on it's way to be filled with toys and games for this little man, it must have been overwhelming as he began to realize that these were for him... to keep... and to share! He was tremendously gracious as he opened each gift, giving them all a little time as he perused them. Even still, he spends a bit of time playing with everything each day. Still very excited that he has firetrucks that make noise!
The Calvinist doctrine of 'predestination' has wracked believers' souls for centuries, and continues to do so to this day. The idea that God has marked out each one of us for eternal joy or eternal torture has driven people to depression, madness and even suicide.
a. Introduction. If the hydraulic brake system, and the drum and brake shoe clearance are satisfactory, when brake pedal is depressed with sufficient force to set brakes firmly, the pedal will have a “solid” feel, with at least 2 inches of floorboard clearance. During the initial 1/4 to 1/2 inch of pedal travel, the pedal should move freely (if pedal clearance is correctly adjusted it will be 3/4 inch for the WW2 jeep). The sub-paragraphs below furnish probable remedies for various behaviors of a defective brake system, based on the behavior of the brake pedal as a symptom.
The bottom line is, men are just as deep and complex as women, they just express it in very different ways. Knowing this, isn’t going to make getting along with each other much easier. Yet, hopefully it will make all of us more understanding of the deeper emotions we all deal with everyday.

This morning, I hopped on Facebook like I do periodically throughout the day. And what do I see being passed around by my friends? An article called "How to miss a childhood" by another blogger at handsfreemama.com. It was an article about the dangers of technology in our world, particularly how technology impacts the life of children. I felt a sinking feeling in my stomach. I had recently watched a BYU Devotional on the same thing. I had pondered it. But, I still find myself on my phone almost constantly. So, I feel like this was another kick in the pants. It made me feel like an awful mother. It made me feel disgusted and angry at myself. It made me feel inadequate. But sometimes in life, those are good things to have happen to you. They make you re-evaluate where you are & what is really important.
- I have had computer tech guy investigating the issues we have been having, and he thinks it may be resolved. Last week we had practically no service for 2 and 1/2 days! So we shall see if it is fixed.
Keep in mind that public education was designed to create beings with set responses to authority. This line of thinking is what got us here having to discuss how to raise a psychic child. We are out of whack with our natural selves because we have subscribed to a system that forces us to try and be like everyone else. Funny enough, we’re not really all that different. But, we must step into our whole selves which includes embracing all of our abilities. Unschooling represents the undoing of that old paradigm. It’s in the experimenting with what we like and want that we discover who we are. As an Unschooling mama, I am pleasantly surprised with how well my son can read, write and analyze data. Unschooling is not about not learning… It’s simply about unblocking that which was holding us back from learning these hidden treasures about ourselves. If you know that regular school is best for your child, trusting that instinct is part of embracing your family’s psychic ability. My suggestion in that case is to take these Unschooling vibes your home life and feel how that inspires you.

There’s now a small gap where they need to wait for the votes to come in, lines close at 9pm. So the compare is on stage and working the studio nicely. He has four signed cue cards and is playing a game (of ‘who’s the biggest fan’) to determin who should get them. He’s having music from the four coaches played, and the people who know all the lyrics, or who are dancing most energetically will be the winners. It’s fun to watch if nothing else. He keeps the audience engaged while we wait and nothing is going on.

As a short story collection, Speculative Japan is a strange book. 200 of its 290 pages are comprised of short stories, and the other 90 pages are mainly short non-fiction essays about the book itself. These essays involve topics such as how the stories appearing in Speculative Japan came to be selected, edited, and translated. 20 of these 90 pages are author and translator biographies, and another 20 pages are filled by a translated essay by Shibano Takumi, the editor of the Japanese sci-fi magazine Uchūjin. For a reader who starts the book at the front cover and progresses in a linear fashion, Speculative Japan gets off to a somewhat rocky start with pages and pages of metatextual material.

Reuters reported on Feb. 1 that the county could see a drop in the rapeseed crop, meaning that vegetable oil imports by the world’s top buyer could rise by about a half a million tonnes in the import year ending Oct. 31.
Overall, this is not your standard celebrity autobiography. It’s consistently funny, interesting and engaging. There were a couple more typos than I would expect for a book that’s published by Random House and originally cost £18.99, but his enthusiasm for the fiction and films of his youth made me wonder whether the fiction I loved as a child had any influence on my life. It’s also interesting to see how much Pegg has matured looking back with hindsight, such as when he realises that a girl in school he thought was crazy probably just “had a big personality and a great sense of humour – two things boys find threatening in girls and thus are likely to dismiss as chronic mental illness” (38). Although Pegg has matured, he has still maintained his childish sense of humour, and that’s what makes this book such a treat.

MARXISM IN CULTURE READING GROUP – LONDON
As the questioning continued, as referred to below, it becomes apparent that the allegation is that Mr Whittamore was used by the NotW for inquiries into Mr Sheridan. Here, as in the case of Mr Coulson, the precise terms of the question and answer are vital. Was Mr Wight categorical that only one investigator was used? Can it be shown Mr Whittamore was instructed by NotW? Would Mr Wight have known this?
The summer surge is attributed to a desire to beat the fee increase and to stepped up campaigns promoting naturalization in anticipation of the upcoming presidential election.
Just like with early Clementine and other early church literature, the literary relationship between Jude and 2 Peter seems to be utterly arbitrary, and serving a hidden theological agenda. Brewer comments that Jude 4 & 17 speaks of prophetic prediction of these false teachers and Jude 4 has pareisduw and 2 Peter 2:1 has pareisagw, both of which are closely related hapax legomenas. If Jude isn’t referring to 2 Peter, we have a lost apostolic document being referred to and must wonder where this lone lost apostolic document went and why it was partially preserved in Jude and 2 Peter. If Jude came after 2 Peter, Jude 17 speaks of fulfillment of 2 Peter 3:3 and skeptics are horribly allergic to fulfilled prophecy since this hints at divine inspiration.[74]
Then we headed out to see a movie at a London Cinema (21 Jump street). Since most things were closed, Andrew decided that he will enjoy a birthday week instead of just one day…..so we will continue celebrating with him for his 30th.

The world literally stopped and it became every man for himself. Anyone exhibiting signs of illness, any illness where tossed onto the fire. It was only the ones that didn’t scream that they knew for sure was truly infected, the rest was chalked up as casualties of war. Those still unaffected fled in fear of contracting the scourge, while others fled with infected loved ones not wanting them to be destroyed. In the end whole families were decimated. Jacob was lost in the chaos, he had been sneaking into the hospital at night trying to discover its origins while Reilly worked at identifying the first victim. They both thought if they could trace the out break back to ground zero they might have a chance in understanding how it worked. Now that Jacobs was gone and the world had gone to shit Reilly had given up hope. There wasn’t anyone left to interview no more leads to follow, even the hope of death had been taken away from him. The stiffness in his muscles was worsening. He couldn’t even hold the pen any more, his fingers were so ridged. All that was left to him now was undying misery.
I could just shut up shop but then be left with beautiful pieces that will go no where unless I do more craft shows, which is what I hope to do later in the year as usual.
I sit here with a lot of anticipation 2 days before the Region 1 Cross Country Championships at Mae Simmons Park in Lubbock, Texas. For the first time since the 1986 season, my Eastwood Troopers have a very realistic shot at finishing in the top 3 and advancing to the State Meet the following weekend. Let me go back a bit in time here.
Let’s hope her sympathy is genuine and she maintains her composure when her husband is discharged from hospital. The last thing Jason needs now is a sardonic spouse who makes satirical remarks while she’s nursing him. A man recovering from a temporary bout of insanity doesn’t want to be reminded that he made a colossal arse of himself whenever he asks for a glass of Lucozade.
I’ll be honest. I wanted to tell him about it. I felt so sad for him not to be included. But it wasn’t mine to do the inviting. And, I knew I had to just let things be. Which is not easy for me.

A novel, like a short story, should be able to stand on its own. It should have a complete story arc with beginning, middle, and ending that an unfamiliar reader should be able to absorb and enjoy without reading five novels before or having to read what follows. Everything required should be there. That doesn't mean there can't be allusion to characters and situations from before that would allow a fan who read the whole series to get something special. But the book should not require outside information pivotal to the story arc of this novel. This story has to stand on its own using only information provided inside the story or it's a cheat and a dirty trick to force more sales.

If this need is real for humanity, why does there appear to be so little freedom? One difficult answer is that in places like the slums in Cairo, Egypt where Stephen’s Children ministers or of India, or in places with strong governments like Cuba or North Korea, structures beyond the individual’s control have a huge roll in determining the options and freedoms available to whole groups of people. What we can do about situations like these depends largely upon what we do with our own situations.
Remember that when you finish a project off you want who ever receives it to be able to enjoy it for a long time. Whether it's just for friends or family or for clients who purchase your crocheted goods. That is a another reason why it's so important to make sure your item is finished correctly. You don't want an unhappy customer. You want them to come back time, after time and tell others about your quality work.
Until then, I will start posting pictures and small tutorials.
Both my trilogies have taken a lot from mythology. In my Lulu Baker trilogy, a very unusual recipe book comes into Lulu’s possession – but she hasn’t heard of any of the ingredients. The more I delved into this subject, the more fun I had inventing rare and wonderful ingredients that come from plants with mythical origins. One favourite is the Idzumo Tree (whose fruit Lulu uses); this is a talking tree. It takes its name from Japanese myth of the Central Land of the Reed Plains, where all the plants used to talk. Another is the Dum’zani plant, that Lulu has to fertilise using her own tears. It is named after Dumuzi, the ancient Sumerian god of fertility and vegetation who was a precursor of Persephone; he descends to the underworld in the height of summer, when all is scorched, and retrieved each autumn by his wife Inanna. Lulu’s recipe book takes its title from the Apples of the Hesperides.
