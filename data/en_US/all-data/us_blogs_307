Some schools in certain developing countries – e.g. Benin, Central Africa Republic, Haiti, Tajikistan, Pakistan and occupied Palestinian territories – provide their students with free meals due to support from bilateral or multilateral agencies such as the United Nations World Food Programme. Beside the development context, the programme has implemented school meals in emergency, protracted relief and recovery contexts. As of 2011, the school meals programme is in 62 countries.
And then the thought that was even more scary that my computer crashing: If my computer dies, can I not buy a new one? Does replacing a computer really count as a new thing (well, I know it does, but I didn't want to admit it).

“It doesn`t sound too real to me,” said Calvin Jones of the Florida state Division of Historical Resources. ” I’m always open minded because we`re always learning new things. But the idea of a pyramid structure, let alone one made of glass, under more than 10 feet of water — the chances are about one in a million.”
So here's what I think... let's stick with a more positive approach and message. If you are a teen or adult and you are facing some questions that scare you or trouble you about your sexuality- take the risk and talk to someone that you know loves you. If you are thinking about hurting yourself or feel like you simply don't want to exist anymore, reach out to someone. If you stop and think for a moment, I hope that there is someone within your circle that you have heard say things that indicate that they are open-minded and all-loving. If there isn't, turn to resources like The Trevor Project.
Had to buy new timber for the studs and boards on the roof, screwing down the 45mm square studs with 90mm screws, and the 15mm thick tongue and groove boards with 45mm screws. The children all helped, excited to be up on the roof. Once the boards were on, however, the surface was a bit too slippery for the kids, even though I made the slope on the roof 2:5 ratio, shallower than the 1:2 ratio that the house roof is, so the asphalt paper and the corrugated iron was my job. I chose iron for the roof to keep it light, but screwed that down with 45mm screws as well. The heavy tile roof on the old house was not wise in an earthquake area. Now it should be strong enough to withstand an earthquake at least of the magnitude of last march, as well as typhoons and heavy snow. Now that spring has come, walls and windows can wait until Autumn.

“Nonprofits” and “community groups” are of course euphemisms for ACORN, Color of Change, Rainbow PUSH Coalition and other such race-hustling commando squads raiding the public’s pocketbook with back artillery cover of Neue-Marxist outfits like Daily Kos, Move On and Center for American Progress. NASA can no more motivate “children” to take up science careers via nonprofits and community organizations than it can by placing recruitment ads in the MTV Video Music Awards young imbecile fest.
All this clears the way for Governor Perry to ask the Board of Pardons and Parole for a pardon recommendation for Timothy Cole, who was falsely convicted of rape and died in prison before DNA cleared his name last year. Cole's family has been adamant demanding the Governor pardon their departed relative, and with this opinion I see no reason that process wouldn't proceed.

“Well, fellas,” Lanigan kept his tone light, “I’m sorry for the inconvenience, but we’re in need of a couple big trucks and a Hummer with a mounted .50.”
The biblical basis of the credal doctrine of the Trinity appears, therefore, to be secure. We can be thankful that the Fathers embodied in Creeds the exegetical conclusions which they had so patiently worked out, since this enables churches that use the Creeds to keep those conclusions constantly before their minds. The positive contribution which Calvin made to the exposition of the doctrine, by emphasising the three Persons and their equality, as each being God, was a valuable one, but the doubt cast by some later Calvinists on the eternal impartation of the divine being and nature by one Person to another has been a regrettable development and, insofar as Calvin was responsible for it, he has had a negative influence also. This negative development has involved an attenuation of trinitarian doctrine and a reductionist approach to the biblical evidence on which it rests, and of these tendencies Professor Helm’s lecture is a rather extreme example.

If the discourse on rock is taken at face value, it can be divided into three periods from the perspective of authenticity. Authenticity was the paradigm of the discourse in the period 1965-80, which makes the period until 1965 the ‘pre-authentic period’ and the eighties and nineties the ‘post-authentic period’. However, the study of cultural production should not isolate the discourse from other elements of the field (Bourdieu, 1993) and this article will furthermore point to the importance of broadening the perspective from Anglo-American music and discourse to other areas. Through this double widening from a narrow discourse analysis the conception of authenticity can not be locked within simple periodisation but becomes a key to the changing and multiple meaning of rock and to the gradual breakdown of centre-periphery relations in the rock field.

Krabby is simply based on a crab, it’s one of the more realistic (ie it looks like the animal it’s based on) designs for Pokemon, though crabs are only that colour when they’re cooked. Its Japanese name is simply “crab”. In the anime, and the game PokePark Wii, Krabby walks sideways, like real crabs do. Instead of saying their name like most Pokemon do, Krabby goes “kooky kooky”.

It was a little more meticulous work than I thought it would be. The stones are very irregular so the bezel has to fit just right. I think it worked out beautifully.

I am hoping to upgrade to gold for some of my more colorful stones.

Afterwards, we went back to admissions to return the meal card and to thank eveyone.

There are a great many phenomena contributing to our experience of the world, and many of them are not observable except through extremely sophisticated methodology which often only infers the results of the experiments which produce them. We must descend through nearly invisible layers of matter to determine the molecular structure of the elements. Our most cutting-edge technologies in physics have revealed the theoretical existence of particles or wave structures so far below the perceptual limits of our senses, that it defies the limits of credulity for most observers to suggest that we could do more than infer their existence.

During college, I had always had early classes (8am is definitely early for this non-morning girl!) I would zombie walk to the cafeteria, grab a bagel/crossaint/eggs sandwich, and eat it on the walk to class. Not very healthy. Lunch was a sandwich and dinner was anything and everything that sounded delish to a sleep deprived hungry student. Helloo pizza, burgers, mozzarella sticks, pasta, and chips! Sounds divine.

One of my friends has a gingerbread party for the children every year. It is one of my favorite things to do at Christmas! Her house is so bright and inviting, and she has such a sweet, sweet family. I found a Maileg kitchen towel with the directions for making gingerbread cookies. I added some measuring spoons and a large peppermint candy cane. She had recently told me that she loved eating these large candy canes as a child. She would carry it around the entire month of December, carefully wrapping it in plastic wrap when not in use! Oh, I remember that!

Now, now that I am able to think in this clear way in this way without depression around my shoulders I can see what I have missed. And now, now I am catching up. Last year at the leavers ball I was one of the select few who didn’t bring a date, didn’t because I had become so rapped up in myself I didn’t have anyone to take, and this year. This year I have. This year I hope is different, different enough for me to catch up with all I have missed. And you know I am trying because, because instead of bunching it all up inside I am trying to let it out. So when I feel bad I don’t need to put on a fake smile and retire early to bed. So that, so that these two Hannah’s that seem to have been created will become one Hannah. Not the Hannah that I allow everyone to see who pretends to cope and the Hannah that no one can meet who sits in bed and plans those unplanned thoughts. To create the one Hannah who has bad days, but can cope with those days and, and who doesn’t retreat into herself. That’s what I am trying to do, to recreate what I was before I turned into a wreck. Instigate these changes, changes that my dreams enter. But still I fear, fear because I know that this wont last, in some time in the future I will return to the wreck, return to those well trodden ways. Because that’s what bipolar is, it’s the cyclical moods, the up and down.

It helps on the yogic path to have an Ishta Devata or chosen form of the Divine to worship, usually some aspect of the Divine Father or Mother. We should seek to connect with them in our experiences. The path of Bhakti Yoga or devotion often revolves around spiritual experiences of the deity through mantra, chanting, pilgrimage and meditation.
My work started making a shift from serene and lovely to whimsical back in 2000, so it makes sense that I was drawn to this clock. But over the years, as my work has progressed, I can definitely see that this one clock had a bit of an influence!

And it's so easy to not notice it happening. Better safe than copy-cat!)

Yes, now is the time that stores do what they do so well: they entice you, excite you, whet your appetite for things you didn't know you needed. And they show you the realm of wants all displayed artfully and temptingly. They deserve all the profits they can make at this time of the year. Without them, we would not know what joys money can buy.
Regular TSM readers will remember the wonderful Power Within project, an effort to produce copies of a powerful anti-bullying comic to distribute nationally to LGBT youth centers.

Thanks to the generosity of caring people like you, the project not only met its goal, it raised more than the $4,200, fully funding the printing. Christensen notes on the Kickstarter page:

From the artist: My goal, as of now, is to break away from the traditional frame or canvas. After years of painting I decided to remove myself from the four corners of the canvas and expand my work to having multiple sides and angles. I was extremely into photorealism and realized that my efforts to depict something realistic, realistically stemmed from an urge to make something three dimensional. My paintings felt trapped in a box.

To make it through tough events in life, we often convince people to view avoid the truth of the situation to make things easier. If someone is afraid of public speaking we tell them to imagine the audience in their underwear – or even nude. For someone escaping certain demise in some catastrophe by walking a thin line high above ground they’re told to avoid looking down. If they look down they’ll see the real danger and it will affect their ability to complete the task.
An analogy would go something like this: Suppose a loving father warns his child not to stray from the house into the road. He warns the child that if the he goes into the road, he could get hit by a car and die. This is a true and sound warning. However, also suppose that the father is perfect and was watching the child at all times. Every time the child wondered too close to the road, the father would run out and grab the child and bring him back into the yard.

There's definitely a place for opinion journalism. MSNBC's full lineup now is opinion journalism, as is Fox News'. The difference is that for the most part, MSNBC hosts' claims can be backed up with something demonstrable, whereas Fox is ALL about pulling stuff out of Roger Ailes' ass and reporting it as truth. Imagine if Fox really WERE a counterpoint to MSNBC, one in which two differing view of how things ought to be done could actually be compared to each other and argued on the merits.

If you think she is behaving badly, be mad. Call her a few names even. But don’t you dare choose names or language that suggest she deserves to be sexually mistreated, subjugated, submissive, or exploited because of her behavior. I think (and perhaps this is an area of conversation) there are names that are inherently threatening and demeaning and, thus, perpetuate violence and violent attitudes, and it’s time we made a moral stand calling to account all who use and/or condone them.
Baboons are the most homophobic of all the hairy primates – it’s because of the complex they have about their behinds. Heterosexual male baboons are tormented by the fear that people will think their exposed rump is a sign of gayness. That’s why they are so hard on baboons who are genuinely gay, driving them mercilessly into exile. I took pity on one such refugee as he sat forlornly on a tree stump:

In terms of the book itself, I was surprised to find that it was a collection of essays (rather than a novel). It was a nice surprise! I think that I was exposed to more facets of running – i.e. coaching, racing, training, hills, trail running, track running, specific competitions – because of it. The book was also a nice read and by about halfway through it I found that I was in that phase where I couldn’t put it down and was walking while reading.

I am so grateful for the optimism, yet my own emotions are experiencing a great divergence from day to day. I continue with all of my best efforts to stay focused on the present, and to allow God to take control of this, but there are days when the fear and doubt come slithering in. There are the days that I have completely accepted that Nora is exactly who God made her to be, and then the days that I mourn the loss of who I thought she was going to be. Some days I imagine what it would be like to bring her home, others I’m tormented by the likelihood of planning for an infant’s funeral. I can’t think of a time in my life where I’ve felt such a loss of control. Yes, it is frightening, but ultimately it is where I need to be in order to let God take over.

Education is highly valued here. Most people cannot expect to get far with anything short of a bachelor's degree and in many cases, a master's degree.

The BPAI first interpreted "hardware error" and found that its broadest reasonable interpretation was "an error related to computer system hardware, e.g., system memory." The Board further found that this interpretation was consistent with the Applicant's specification. In particular, the Board noted that the specification referred to a machine check abort (MCA) signal as a "hardware error signal” and that the specification further stated that the MCA signal "may occur when an error occurs in reading and loading memory data, i.e., from corrupted memory."

That is, of course, a lie, as Annie just wants to get Vanessa alone so she can tell her she knows EVERYTHING and to STAY AWAY FROM LIAM!!! Vanessa tells Annie she’s got no idea what she’s capable of and Annie tells Vanessa she won’t tell Liam about her ID’s if she leaves. Later, Annie comes by looking for Liam and Adrianna tells her that Liam and Vanessa went out of town. Annie says she has to find out where they went and tells Adrianna about the car/ID situation. Adrianna says that Annie could be wrong and could be pushing Liam away. We then see Liam and Vanessa on a bridge eating some food. Liam tells Vanessa AGAIN that he wants to be in a relationship with her, not Annie. Vanessa then says she has something to show him. Vanessa leads the duo to a house, where she tells Liam she hit him with her car and that she’s been in trouble with the law before. Annie then shows up out of the blue.
The age-old adage “Never judge a book by its cover” is a great sentiment when it comes to accepting and understanding people but when it comes to actual books unfortunately it matters.

I had been vacillating over whether it was worth my purchasing a Kindle. I tried my wife's Kindle on vacation and found it pleasant enough to use on a plane. Not sure I really wanted to spend the money on it (being inclined towards frugality in some areas), I was, however, attracted by the Kindle convenience and the huge library of free books. My lovely and talented wife put an end to my vacillation by giving me one. Thanks Hon!

In fact we know we are reaching a wider community, Autism Awareness Month does get media coverage, and it is marked by documentaries like Louis Theroux’ Tough Love. More importantly we have a presence in the mainstream media, autistic characters are being written into more and more television dramas and the occasional comedy, autistic characters feature in mainstream movies from Hollywood to Bollywood. Even more importantly governments are beginning to notice us, some American states are specifically recognising Autism in healthcare provision, Scotland now has a national Autism Strategy with over thirteen million pounds of government funding. In all honesty the gains so far made, however magnificent, are small compared to the overall needs of the autism community, but they are a start for which we should be grateful. The campaigners who have won these gains should be proud, and we should be proud of them.
I’m often with the “boys” whether we are eating or pre-gaming or in a club. I am very fond of all six of them and will keep in touch with them when we all leave to go our separate ways. The one that I’ll discuss in particular won’t stop being attractive! He is really smart, my go-to guy for class and other miscellaneous things, down to earth, has sex appeal and he’s mature! I find myself constantly talking about him! I really wanted him to meet my French girlfriend. Just wanted to introduce the two. While waiting for him to show up at a party I could not stop talking about him. My friend asked, “Why do you want me to meet him so bad?” I said because he’s just really cool. I’m sure you’ll like him. (Everyone would like him! Did I mention he’s awesome?)

Soooo... how to get started on this paleo lifestyle? First and foremost, ask yourself the question, "Do I really want to do this? Am I ready?" If you find a bunch of excuses for why you can't stick with it, then maybe it's not time for you quite yet. Or maybe you need a step by step approach... starting with cutting out the grains (CUT THE GRAINS, I'M SERIOUS!), then the sugars, the starches, the legumes.

I can't speak for their parents - maybe they didn't have enough to offer, maybe they couldn't handle the pressures of their own lives and therefore couldn't be there for their children. I don't know the situations. I just know that I saw kids who were falling and no one was there to pick them up.

I've decided to change my drawing style. My drawing stucks when it needs perspective. So I searched for old masters, what did they do or which style they used. Not surprised of course, they was using a style named "Gesture" I was know that but I wasn't know what gesture for. At the begining; I didn't need something like that. But now I'm thinking it's the only way to reach exactly what I need. I started to search and study about it by monday. I wasn't able to draw gesture drawing so it didn't work for me but I believe it will!
Dave Sim is a polarizing figure. On the one hand, he’s a giant in independent comics publishing, and his accomplishment of viably sustaining a self-published comic series over a long and ambitious series of plot arcs makes him an undeniable and significant part of any conversation about independent comic books.

Heather Trimlett put out a 40 bead challenge where you choose two colors and make 40 beads only using dots. At first I it wouldn't be that hard, I love doing dot beads but after the first 20 it got tough. My beads are strung onto the leather in the order I completed them starting in the center. I started with some of the basics and moved on quickly to masking dot techniques that I had never tried but had seen others do an loved the look. As time went on I had to wrack my brain for ideas because it turns out that 40 beads are a lot to do with the same technique being limited to only two colors, I used CIM Phoenix and Moretti Dark Red Purple. I loved the fact that the Phoenix turned different shades depending on how long it spent in the torch but in the end I think it may have been cheating a bit :).

Less known perhaps is that following the exodus from Egypt, we embarked on forty years of kvetching in the desert, including this gem of a complaint found in Numbers 16:13: "Isn’t it enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the desert?" Note well: our complaint was that Egypt was the land of milk and honey!

There will (hopefully) be more babies in our future, ones that we will get to bring home, cherish and never take for granted. But Joey will always be in my heart. He will always be my first baby.

He is the one that showed me what life is really about. It’s not about

So how does this all affect financial planning? When rates change, it affects the survival rate for retirement plans. Calculations for needed post retirement income cash flows and the amount of time until all the money is gone from the retirement fund are all in jeopardy. By changing assumptions about the broader U.S. market (in the inputs of our equations), we find that it can change the range of the projected safe retirement period. As for the future, I suspect that the ERP will be lower than what we have seen in the last 30 or so years and that we are likely to see long-term inflation rates around 3%. My standard assumption of 6.5% return per year for the S&P 500 lies within range of historical results. I believe that the best thing is to be conservative. Hope for the best and plan for the worst.
There are a few reasons that I feel like this, the main one being that when you go to the skatepark, you become best friends with groups of 16 year old teens. The problem with this is that there isn’t really a whole heap of maturity to be developed from 18 onward (as I have learned from working with people a lot older than myself) and I personally find it way too easy to sink my maturity down to that same level. It is actually a lot of fun until you notice a random parent looking at you with pity.

My first thought was 3000 is a lot of CDs, around 6 or 7. So I set aside work to write my pretty stupid idea for an essay about how I’m grateful finally for MP3s and technology in general. I would have said that I’m grateful to 2010 for finally giving me the epiphany that technology is good, that it makes people lead better, convenient lives. But I thought the society of writing geniuses that run the contest might misinterpret the essay as incorrect or just plain stupid, and that I’m missing the point of it since it’s quite clear that one is supposed to write about a heartwarming, modesty or charity-driven Chicken Soup type of essay, which I just don’t have the persuasion powers to pull off.

The comedy is up and down, but I laughed enough. I have a feeling some people might get annoyed by T.J. Miller (you may remember him as the voice behind the camera in Cloverfield), but I thought he was funny. In fact, Kirk’s collection of friends, overall, was much less annoying than the usual group you’d see advising the hero in the ways of women. They didn’t score a huge amount of laughs, outside of Miller, but at least they were tolerable.
Now we've been introduced to someone called The Brothers. I must confess to having no memory at all of this, a sort of pop-reggae thing. Still, the drummer has a cuddly toy on his drum kit, so they at least have something going for them.

I was recently contacted by a journalist who was keen to write a story about private midwifery as a career. He told me his audience is people who are contemplating a career in health, and he hoped to shed light on the ins and outs of the particular career that was in the spotlight. He told me he wanted to present information in an informal, conversational manner, and even hoped for a bit of humor; that by the time a reader had read the piece they would have not only an idea of the particular career profile, but also know something about the person who had been interviewed for the article.

The record has a lot of personality. I'm seriously diggin it. Obnoxious punk crap that was a precursor in some ways to the snotty sound FYP was throwing down in the mid 90's. Shit, I almost hear a little Celtic Frost or Hellhammer sound in there as well but it's probably just them buzzsaw guitars making me think that way because no one would mistake this for Metal. Reminds me a little bit of the band Filth who were gigging in the East Bay around the same time or even Grimple who would be coming down the pike a few years later. I'm not saying T.P.U. was as good as the above mentioned bands but if you're at all familiar with any of the names mentioned above then you'll probably like this record.

Some advice you might object less to. Advising children not to get into cars with strangers and to look left and right when they cross the road. That I suspect is one aspect of the nanny state you don’t object to. I don’t read many blogs taking the line “How dare the government advise kids not to take jelly babies off strangers that pull up to them in cars and ask them whether they want to get in the back seat and stroke some puppies. It’s a free country goddammit; the kid should make their own mind up, assess the risks for themselves and decide whether they get in the car. Not all strangers offering jelly babies to kids are going to rape and murder them. It’s a diabolical liberty and infringement of our basic freedoms. Why are we paying our taxes for this?” Though if you know different, let me know. That would be one worrying blog to read.
Most people take on a job to meet one or more of the six human needs, be it certainty, uncertainty, connection, growth, contribution or significance. The idea is that having a job will provide financial security, either temporarily or indefinitely for some, depending on their goals and intentions. For others having a job meets the need of significance where by you might lead a team or run a department, or even the business or company itself. For others the job provides uncertainty or variety from an other wise mundane life. Whatever the reason, some part of your belief system feels that having a job will meet these needs. If your job makes you happy and meets your needs then a huge high five to you, nothing beats being happy. For those saying, “Tell me about, I can’t wait to leave this place!” then we need to talk here for a moment. By the way, a job can also be your business or company.

11/22/63, by Stephen King – My first, and probably only Stephen King, but I loved it. Loved. Time travel novels are kind of my kryptonite and this one was ah-mazing. Jake Epping is a high school teacher in present-day Maine, divorced from a manipulative alcoholic, when he reads an essay by one of his night GED students about the night the student’s father committed a brutal multiple murder. That shocking tale is still reverberating in Jake’s head when his sort-of friend Al Templeton drops a major bombshell: the storeroom in Al’s diner is a portal to 1958. A time-traveler who’s willing to risk… well… everything could pop through, take up residence in the past, and prevent Lee Harvey Oswald from shooting JFK in 1963. Al can’t carry the mission through himself – he’s returned from an attempt just to die of lung cancer. Jake is intrigued, and he thinks he might be able to stop his student’s father from committing his horrific crime if he travels back, so he goes. What Jake doesn’t bargain for is falling in love – which he does, with a lovely (albeit klutzy) librarian named Sadie Dunhill. Will Jake be able to carry out his “business” in the past and save JFK, or will his love for Sadie distract him from the dangerous work he has to do? And if he succeeds, what consequences might flow from his act? 11/22/63 is a tome that kept me feverishly turning pages, including over 400 in one day – it’s just that exciting. (It’s also violent and contains some pretty offensive language, so potential readers beware.) This wasn’t Stephen King’s usual fare, which might be why I loved it so much – because horror doesn’t hold much appeal for me, although time travel / suspense / love stories do. (I loved Jack Finney’s Time and Again, and King thanks Finney in his acknowledgements – makes sense.) After reading this heart-wrenching page-turner, there’s nothing for me to do but add my voice to the chorus saying… All hail the King.

My night time routine is second nature to me. I enjoy spending those 10-15 minutes taking things off and putting things on and rubbing things in and generally winding down before getting in to bed. Paul, on the other hand, is a brush teeth/have a wee/jump in to bed kinda guy. The closest he comes to a skincare routine is a daily spot check in the mirror and a quick squeeze if he sees anything vaguely suspicious. (I have seriously played this down- spot squeezing is by far his worst habit- it drives me mad!!)

I began the month in conference mode, affording myself the opportunity to spend rather too long in the company of like-minded individuals with whom I have nothing in common. For three long days and three even longer nights we were cooped up together in a crumbling private school to make Hogwarts seem embarrassingly post-post-modern, suffering taps which failed to run and (thanks to the bloody heating) noses which ran big time. The best part? It shat it down — like some torrential hell had been visited upon us for the duration of our stay.

*The plot. There was too much going on. The car accident was not even the main focus of this book. It was mostly centered around Paige, Lacey, and Jake + their relationship drama. Every time I turned around Paige was fighting with Jake about how close he was getting to Lacey, how he was ditching her for Lacey, etc. etc. Then she'd forgive him and pretty much turn into a bumbling fool every time the guy kissed her or gave her a hug. She let him act like a complete jerk and give her the run around without any consequences. No wonder he walked all over her! The other issue with the plot was that there was a parallel storyline about gay rights. I guess where these people live is some sort of cowtown. So they have cowtown views on such things, and when a teacher is suspected of being gay, rumors are started, and eventually accusations are made and he ends up getting into some trouble. Well, I don't really think this added anything to the plot as a whole. I feel like if this element were taken out, the story could have been better. It's not that I have a problem with gay rights, don't get me wrong. I am actually very passionate about them. It's just that the impact of the message that (I thought) was supposed to be the main focus of this novel would have been more intense. Don't drink and drive, right? Instead, the gay rights issue took over more of the book than the actual drunk driving thing. That, plus the relationship drama and teen angst, just made this book one big, mixed-up blob of stuff. If someone asked me what it was about, I would not know what to say. Drinking and driving? Gay rights? Shallow girls learning to be nicer and less judgmental? Vapid mothers? Writing? Cowtown assholes? Love triangles? It's all too much.

In conclusion: The Ferry building is obviously a destination for both tourists and locals alike. The plaza is aware of its appeal and I can't blame for the stores inside, who no doubt paying large rents, for cashing in on their captive audience. However, I think Taylors is pushing it a bit too far. At those prices they should at least provide a clean environment, staff with a little more savvy, decent utensils, larger portions and a more interesting wine list. My advice is to skip eating or drinking here and head to the The Ferry Plaza Wine Merchants instead, where you can get a great glass of wine at a much better price. They also serve picnic boxes of cheese or pate with bread, or you can take along a snack of your own choice to consume at the bar whilst you sample their wine specials.

Let's address the arguments right away. Yes, some romance novels are crap. Terribly written tripe with rapey heroes, stupid heroines, and an HEA (Happily Ever After) I wouldn't believe in a million years. You know what most romance novels are, though? Well-written. With flawed but funny heroes, smart and interesting heroines, and a HEA I see coming (because it's romance and you have to have the HEA) but can totally believe. Let's just say that Jennifer Crusie, Laura Kinsale, Eloisa James, Lauren Dane, and the Godmother of them all, Susan Elizabeth Phillips, kick Dan Brown's vanilla-prosed, conspiracy-spouting ASS.

This low-rise building sits slightly back on a raised plaza at the corner of West 40th Street and Seventh Avenue in Midtown. Its height and general shabbiness make it seem a likely development site in the future. Which would be a shame. It was designed in 1960-62 by William Lescaze, an early pioneering modern architect, who is unfortunately not that well-known today. His own landmark designated-house has been featured on this blog, and he designed more than a dozen other buildings, including housing for the City of New York. The building was originally commissioned by the Brotherhood in Action and named for them, although I can find nothing out about the organization. There is still an inscription on the marble base that runs around the building.

randomosities... i thought maybe i made that word up in a stroke of "genius". but i looked it up. it's been used before, even if it's not a real word. oh, well. speaking of looking up words, i looked up a word a little while ago to see what it meant. it's a word i had heard before... often enough to recognize it. but i never really knew what it meant. and i must not have been curious enough to know either, because it wasn't until today that i made the effort... this time, i was curious! i'll get to all that in a little bit, though.
“I have encountered many children that bear the burden of parents that struggle with the grips of addiction,” he said. “My program is court-mandated.

If Christ is so important, then why does he say the church is the answer and not Christ? If the church is the answer, then why does he say that his church is not for people who want to know Jesus? Why was he hostile against the gospel at his revival by sensoring it? If Christ is important at all, why did Furtick cheer Perry Noble on for promoting him as Messiah?

But she is not alone. In recent seasons we’ve seen, Xavier Carter (10.00/19.63) and Wallace Spearmon (9.96/19.65) jumping on the coaching carrousel and leave prominent coaches right on the cusp of the Olympic season itself. And the coaching move of Jeremy Wariner from quarter miler guru Clyde Hart to assistant Michael Ford has been one of the most chronicled coaching changes ever. Wariner went from Olympic gold medalist and two time World Champion to consistent runner up to Lashawn Merritt while running nearly a second slower as a result of his downgrading of coaches! Losing Olympic and World Championships gold in the process.

No one knows what is going on behind any of those doors because no one is told and if they were told, they'd be told in French and 95% of us don't speak French because we all just arrived in Paris. Luckily I have the bilingual Montreal dude in my alliance and ask him questions whenever he is released from a door. Then I convey his information to one of the girls who come out of another door, who passes it onto the next girl if I am behind one of the blue doors.

We also don't have that crazy ladder on the back patio any longer, and probably most important is that there are NO BOXES!! I'd like to think (and remember) just what we accomplished this summer and know that while I didn't scrapbook a whole lot, I finally got our house turning into a home (slowly but surely) and I spent time doing fun things with my kids.
"As we got closer to the street, we looked up the road, and we saw a quite a bit of commotion going on and there was a guy laying in the road, and nobody was even laying there. He wasn't even moving. Finally a car pulled up. They stopped right next to the guy, and it looked like someone was going to help him. We were kind of stuck, because we couldn't cross. Traffic was going through. Young black men running around, beating on people, and we were like 'Let's get the heck out of here.' The light turned, and I got attacked from behind. I just got hit in the back of the head real hard. I'm like, 'What the heck is going on here?' I heard my bell ring."

And the Langdowns are kind of celebrating today. On account of the public holiday, and to make up for the fact that we didn't go on our annual long weekend adventure, we're having a picnic by the river with the extended family this morning. Derek's parents, my parents, Derek's brother and family, four medium sized kids and two big kids (with husband/wife) and ALL the dogs. We're off to eat a chicken brunch by the Murrumbidgee River and play a bit of cricket and perhaps some soccer. It will be a nice day.

It feels so good to finally be at a healthy weight and be able to do so much more because you have gotten the weight off! I'm so proud of you!

Jeff Parker once told me that he counted sentences in paragraphs and words in sentences as a way to increase tension. At the climax, the sentences and the paragraphs got shorter; the words fewer. In other words: short crisp sentences are more energetic and keep the reader moving along at that rapid clip you want to claim.

I have just returned from a two-day stay on an island called Koh Samet located about half way between my current residence and the Cambodian border. I had been to Koh Samet a few years previously and that trip proved to be one of those life altering events, bringing with it a lot of pain and changing my expectations about the rest of my life. But that is another story for another time and place.
Since Anna is on the cusp of three-dom, I figure it’s a great time to start implementing new and fun activities into our schedule. Our options for outside activities are pretty limited since we live in the sweaty butt-crack of the sun, so any activity we choose must have the following:

Consider this: How has all travel, thus far, functioned? Air, sea, space, or land, we move progressively across space. Now, granted, that’s space, and we’re talking time. Time, though, isn’t supremely different than space. We can’t define what makes up space anymore than we can time (ask a physicist sometime about ‘what space is made of’ and get ready for some weird, mostly theoretical stuff). The primary difference, though, is that we are better able to perceive of space than we are time. Perhaps, for this reason, time travel is beyond us–we just aren’t smart enough to ‘see’ it as it is.

I've written here, at some point, about the amount of books and related material that I've read, or watched, about the two world wars. My thirst for knowledge about it was based on, on the one hand, the need for historical perspective: to be able to have a sense of what informed the flow of events and how these have shaped the subsequent decades upon which they still have a huge impact.

Rayloth’s brows knitted themselves together as he looked up at the Grand Master of the Jedi Order and the Force tugged at the base of his skull. Not quite a warning—and too vague to put a proper name to—but there was definitely something big lurking around the edge of his perception, like a massive Mon Calamari shark swimming just below the surface. “What is our mission to be?”

Remember Cristiane? This week we finally find Guilherme (her boyfriend) at home too and were able to teach them both together. Cristiane said that he never seemed interested in participating in the lessons before and always stayed up in his bedrooms when the sisters would come over. Sister Dangerfield and I were praying that we could start teaching Guilherme too, because, really, it is a lot easier for a couple to progress when they are progressing together. And our prayer was answered! Guilherme still kind of seem reluctant at first, but he came down and listened and participated in the lesson, and by the end he seemed a lot more receptive. They said they´re going to start reading the Book of Mormon together every night...I´m excited! I know it´s going to help Cristiane a lot!
And yes, I know, I am spoilt rotten by my adoring husband who has never played the role of the token father, changing nappies, giving bottles and getting up in the middle of the night for her from day one. He is amazing, a legend and most days he's my hero when he's not making me want to scream for leaving the SAME GOD DAMNED CUPBOARD OPEN EVERY MORNING despite repeated requests that he please just humour me and close it.
I can screw with guys. In fact, I can’t say that I’m completely innocent in this game of commitment-phobia. Bad Boy probably would’ve gotten old really fast had he not mistaken me for his doormat. Maybe I have some karmic debt to pay. Believe me, though, I wasn’t born with my intimacy issues. I really do deserve some karmic credit. Or at least a balanced account. So fuck you, Mr. Zegna. I deserve more.
The Nik software already has made me rely less on my Photoshop skills by allowing me to make subtle as well as tonal changes without individual layer masks. It also wakes up the echoes of my photo darkroom supervisor in Heidelberg, Germany: Herr Tkach was a soft spoken formal man from Czechoslavakia. He worked at the Army Headquarters in Heidelberg and ran the photo darkroom which was available to all military and civilian personnel assigned to headquarters. He experimented with his color landscape photos of Heidelberg and one, a 16 X 24 “solarized” print, was completely unrecognizable as Heidelberg. That’s the one I liked.

Unfortunately, the middle and high schools that these children move onto, more often than not, do not offer them the same quality of education as their primary school has. The children will have to walk for at least an hour each way to get to school, and sadly, some girls won't even continue on as they are kept at home to help around the house.

Salvation is that simple. It is not according to what we do to attain to God but it is rather what God has already done for us. Grace is a FREE gift that was given by God in his abundant love for us. It is by YOUR faith that you are saved no one else can get saved for you and you cannot get saved for someone else.
Kept saying “Awesome venue!” on the train at Vauxhall and rubbing his knees against me!!!!! Hoped to avoid him, but he got off at Clapham (platform 4) and walked very close to me all the way to platform 15 (I was varying my speed....) where he said “Oh, aren’t you coming with me to the exit?” I said “Er, no.

Bersih’s rank and file are responding to legitimate concerns regarding inequities that exist across Malaysia’s diverse population. Ethnic Malaysians are perceived to be receiving more benefits and upward social mobility than Malaysia’s large groups of ethnic minorities. Likewise it is perceived that Malaysia’s ruling government has an unfair advantage come election time. However, the movement’s demands and tactics seek simply to destabilize Malaysia politically and return known Western collaborators, and in particular Wall Street proxy and International Monetary Fund (IMF) functionary Anwar Ibrahim, back into power.

The first major DLC release for Gears of War 3 finally hit a few weeks ago (Yes, I’m ignoring the Horde Command Pack DLC), with RAAMs Shadow. This campaign DLC takes players back to the point in time right after Emergence Day only instead of seeing the familiar faces of Marcus and Dom, you’ll be picking up the lancer rifles of Zeta Squad. Gears of War villain, General RAAM, also returns and better yet, players finally get to take down COG soldiers as the big man. With a new campaign story lasting around 3 hours, more multiplayer skins, new achievements, and a new weapon skin, is RAAMs Shadow worth your time or should it be curbstomped?

Realize that the entire world is not being directly controlled, but indirectly manipulated through disease, war, famine, poisoning of the food and water, climate manipulation, television, medication, education, celebrity, etc. Not every event is being orchestrated, but major events that shift world power and thought are being orchestrated in some manner. It is not a conspiracy theory that all of these events happened on these days, rather the significance and the history of each one of these events. Each one is a staple of American History!

Whilst no soup was proffered on this occassion, Pasta e Fagioli would be a comforting welcome to any guest. With many in Italy disputing its origins most claim the soup originated in the Veneto and Tuscany regions and previously in ancient Rome. It’s regarded as a simple peasant soup designed to fill the stomach with the combination of beans and pasta but in modern times it has been re-invented and turned into more of a showpiece. Traditionally eaten as an autumn-winter dish when pork / pancetta is widely available, I decided to knock up a batch to warm us in this current bad weather we’ve been having in northern Italy.

The answer to that criticism might be, at least, it is a start. (And to be fair, Garcia’s plan is also at least a start, although it comes off as bureaucratic gamesmanship to grab credit at the end of the administration of Mexican President Felipe Calderon.) That $5 million grant will be spread over four years and will be administered by Freedom House* which will work with the Mexican Human Rights Commission, the Mexican Interior Ministry, and with Mexican non-profits. The U.S. embassy has supported other safety programs for journalists in the past, which included training for reporters in hostile conditions, along with training on how to use electronic tools to protect their online identities and cell phones conversations.

From evidence I've gathered looking at her things, I think the mother-in-law had been a seamstress. I had two questions about the machine - these two would tell me everything I needed to know: What kind? Where was it made? It took her 10 minutes to answer those questions. She had no idea where to look to answer them. I meant to ask both together, but once the first question was out of my mouth, she was gone to look. So she had to go twice. Poor dear.

I was very proud of him because we hadn't tried him sleeping in it before the trip, in fact, the Michigan trip was kind of a trial for our Africa trip, which is why we got it in the first place.

I love a good, complex character. Greta Kendall has so much going on, both out in the open and under the surface that you can’t help but want to get to know her better. The relationship she has with her aging mother only makes her even more likable. The twists and turns in both her life and her emotional state create an intensely emotional story that will really draw out your own feelings. She’s representative of so many women in the real world, the ones that look like they have it all together, but are actually falling apart when no one’s looking.

We continue the demand, adopted by the whole trade union movement in the 1970s, for May 1st to be a public holiday. The Labour Government of the time imposed the divisive decision to make the nearest Monday a Bank Holiday. This created many difficulties and separated Britain from virtually every other European country that celebrates May Day on 1st May. The anti-union laws of the Tories further pressured the movement and made participation in May Day difficult. But in the last 5 years May Day has been growing.

So the kids have started soccer. It is always exciting in the beginning. They get up early to put on their socks, shin pads, shirts and shoes. Very early. This has been much anticipated all year long. Soon the june bugs will make their appearance and half of my children will be sitting in the grass playing with them. The sun will get hotter and we will be steaming, sitting, anticipating when soccer will be finished. I love to see my children grow. Which brings me to my next post...growing and punishment.

As an author, you need to be aware of where your story's headed, whether you're a planner or a seat-of-the-pantser like me. Maybe not the specific ending for the story, but where you want your characters to be and what you want to accomplish with the story. The ending is your last chance to have your say and accomplish your goals, but you lay the groundwork for that ending from the very beginning, whether your ending is effectively polishing off a fulfilling entree or topping off a light meal with dessert.

The committee interviewed Paulson in April, 2009. He detailed the circumstances that led to the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the financial impact and confusion it caused. Paulson said that he received 70 and 80 calls a day from banks, and financial industry groups about the takeover. Waters’ call was one of them. Paulson was adamant that Waters did not “mention a particular bank” when she requested the meeting. Paulson quickly added that “even if she had mentioned that she had a personal financial interest in One United Bank that he would still have granted the meeting. He considered the request reasonable and non-partisan.
The U.S. must begin to plan for the non-combatant evacuation of Israel to the U.S. as a means to mitigate or avoid a second Holocaust. Prevention of such a tragedy by diplomatic or military means alone is unrealistic. With Iran threatening to be in possession of nuclear weapons soon, other increasingly hostile neighbors of Israel will follow suit to respond to the new Mideast balance of power. More ominously, nuclear weapons will find their way into the hands of radicals through state sponsorship of terrorism. Whether the conflagration occurs later in a general confrontation, or sooner as a function of a 3rd or a later 4th Intifada, the writing is on the wall as it pertains to the most vulnerable members of the Israeli populace and the preparations that Israel and the U.S. must make.

Grubb does a very good job weaving these mysteries together and keeping all of the various story lines interesting. I was a bit let down because I could guess the final reveal mid-way through the novel, but it still played out in an interesting and entertaining way.
Feeding the Gods is a big trip, where time has run away with itself and men ‘meant’ to be dead are very much alive, some doing odd things. Franz Kafka has clawed his way into the dressing room. P.B. Shelley has all too obviously lent Hamilton part of his stash. Plentiful alcohol has also crept into the genesis of these pages. In between the ears of this Scott Hamilton, who does not play rugby at all, but reads a hell of a lot, there is something divergent; a mythopoeic morass that seeps onto the page with a flurry of quick-shuffle images and juxtaposed heroes, and above all, a vibrant social conscience...Scott Hamilton, the non-All Black who has never met Graham Henry, exists in a strange sociolinguistic ethos in comparison to most of his Pakeha poetic peers, in an extra-intelligent terrain unexplored by most of his fellow citizens...

In other BIG news, My uncle Jesse was ordained a Deacon in the Catholic Church last month! We missed his ordination 'cause I had to work, but we did get to go to his thanksgiving Mass last Sunday. It was beyond cool to see him up on the altar with the priest! What a blessing to have an ordained man of God in the family. My grandparents would've been so proud. Sorry no pics, but I promised him I'd keep him as incognito as possible. :)

There are technically two new girls in New Girl. One is trouble-maker Becca, who was shoveled off to boarding school by her parents for her junior year. Becca mysteriously goes missing at the end of the year and her spot is replaced by new girl #2 for her senior year, whose name we don't even learn about until the end of the novel. The story switches back and forth between the two girls as they both advance through their respective years, and it's kind of interesting to see how each girl is treated by the student body.

WoW has helped me cope with a lot of things in life it has to be said, but in one area it falls short. As a level 85 arcane mage (ilevel 387 – I’m getting there – I can almost taste level 397…it is salty) I feel I’m due actual powers by now. I mean surely the game should be set up so that eventually, through some sort of magical whizzy abracadabra timey whimey power transference you actually become the class you play. Wouldn’t advocate being a rogue though- probably end up in prison, and I’ve heard druids are hard to toilet train, but the rest…well the real world is crying out for some real life WoW class power, and no more so than at family parties.

Namely, žito is not a dessert. The door of the family house where slava is celebrated stands open on the day of its patron saint. At the door stands a younger female family member with a bowl of consecrated žito (in a church ritual, žito is blessed and "crossed" with red wine by an Orthodox priest). The visitors will cross themselves in the Byzantine fashion and take one teaspoonful of žito before they proceed into the house.

We also have been brainwashed (don't ask by who because I honestly have no idea where we all got this from) that we as individuals cannot make a difference and that it takes a gazillion of us to get anything done. In some ways this is, of course, true. If you have a mob of thousands, you're going to be heard faster than one person screaming at the top of his or her lungs. However, I believe that a well thought out plan enacted by an individual person can be more effective at making change happen than a mob that is easily written off as a group of apathetic, lazy moochers...

When one with only a superficial knowledge of the country thinks of the racial makeup of Argentina he thinks of Spaniards, Italians, a smattering of escaped Nazi war criminals and a sprinkling of immigrants from all over the rest of Europe. What he doesn't realize is that this describes only the relatively unimportant 95 per cent of the population which has merely replaced the long since wiped out Indians as the peons and serfs of that society. The other five per cent control absolutely everything, and they are Jews.

Steel's masher, or the external masher, was invented in 1853. It gives a much more consistent mix of grain and water and does it as they both enter the tun. Such a good design that it's still in wide use today. So, if the mixing has been done before the grain has even got into the tun, why still have internal rakes?

But the love I felt was so intense, and the peace so profound, that I welcomed her... well, I welcomed her with an open heart.

In the past, the term "partner" was one I used only because I hated referring to a significant other as "boyfriend." Saying "partner" sounded less sophomoric, more serious and committed. And sometimes it kind of confused people who were used to hearing the word only to describe gay and lesbian couples. I sort of liked that. It felt like I was being ultra-politically correct by using it.
So many times we are waiting on God – and God is waiting on us. Why do we hesitate? Why do we draw back from God’s Word and His promises.
But all along, people (including our pediatrician) keep saying, “There’s no link between vaccines and autism.” I’ve never understood how such a sweeping statement can be made with such confidence. The fact is, nobody knows what does cause autism – so how can anybody say with absolute certainty what does not cause autism? My, albeit very amateur, guess is that different things cause autism in different children. For some, it probably is vaccines. And the scary thing is, there is no way to know which children will be adversely affected and which will not.

It’s a knowing wink to the audience, and this kind of fourth wall acknowledgment is used throughout THE MUPPETS, which adds to the general pleasantness of the film. Miss Piggy is last on the list of Muppets to bring back into the fold, with Kermit actually willing to not go after her. The others protest and they’re off to Paris. When Mary tells Walter they can’t drive to Paris in a car, the Muppets tell her they can do it if they “drive by map,” and we see an image of a map pop up with the traditional hand-drawn route line taking us quickly from LA to France.

I also noticed some leaves appeared on the trees and some grass growing. Then I thought perhaps..if grass could grow, maybe flowers would..so I planted some. My neighbours did the same and now it's just a beautiful colourful paradise in my neighbourhood! What a miracle!

It was here that I first became acquainted with the Countess of Segur, Mark Twain, Louisa M. Alcott, Robert Lawson, and so many other excellent writers. I doubt that I would be the same person I am today if it hadn't been for that key, that place, those books. When, a few months later, the library was officially reopened, I was distraught! My kingdom was no longer my own, my refuge was taken from me. Or so I felt. I was rather a selfish child then, though not in a malicious way. I did not know anyone else who loved books as I did and truly believed that no one else would enjoy them as I did. I am sure now that I was wrong.

So maybe I should say that I am not DOING anything with my degree. Rather, I am allowing God to chisel away at my being (in order to intensely purify my understanding of the faith) right now in preparation to participate in the "doing" of God through me. How God is going to call upon me to use this great gift of intense, reflective study has yet to be fully revealed, but then again, I am already participating in His mission in my vocation as a wife and mother. So even if my ultimate task in life turns out to simply pass on a more vibrant and accurate understanding and witness of faith to my children, this time and effort will have been more than worth it.

The campaign represents a school supply assistance program for the greater Piscataquis area by providing starter packs of new school supplies for families in need throughout MSAD #4, #41, #46, #68 and Union #60. (The starter packs include erasers!) Last year nearly 250 kids benefitted from the program and there’s every reason to believe the need will be even bigger this coming school year. Penquis is looking for donors to help empower our kids.

Your ego may tell you that running away from the situation is cowardly. I disagree. In some circumstances I think it’s the best decision to make. If a lion comes up on a deer the deer would be stupid to try to fight a lion, the deers strength is to run away, it’s the lions strength to fight. For example, you cannot fight with negativity. The moment you fight with negativity you become negative. Often time the wisest option is to run away from negativity.

Shrove Tuesday is the day before Ash Wednesday, which is the beginning of Lent, for Catholics. Lent is the 40 days preceding Easter, which Catholics usually restrict guilty pleasures and try to eat simpler and leaner. So, since pancakes are made with sugar, fat, flour, eggs, which is traditionally restricted during lent; they have become to popular way to start off Lent. Since Lent is about giving up indulgences, I figured I'd give you all a pancake that would be worthy of Pancake Tuesday.
We rented a house in Girdwood last month for 3 days with some friends so that we could enjoy a couple full days of skiing. It was great to have a nice place to crash, have some hot soup and margaritas, and hang out instead of having to deal with the long drive back home, exhausted after a day of skiing. The kiddos had lots of fun playing with each other and so did the adults! We saw a great band at the Sitzmark Bar and Grill where Miles and I had our wedding reception. The skiing was amazing-decent temps and conditions. Willa's skills really improved after taking a couple classes and she felt confident enough to venture to the top on the tram with us for the first time! Dylan blew us off the mountain as usual....but the old folks are happy at their current level of speed-I have a career depending on a functioning body, after all! I'm loving my new updated skis...what a huge difference from the straight looooooong skis I'd had since high school! No one stares anymore or says,"WOW!!!! OLD school!"
Jackals and cobras on the palace grounds; sleeping sweaty under a lace mosquito net; being served tea on the royal crest china, waking to the call of the whooping Koel bird, the snow shower of white blossoms beneath the plumeria tree heady with tropical perfume - I suddenly felt like a character in a Rudyard Kipling story. Some killjoy will probably have to write in accusing me of having "Orientalist fantasies."

A source of electricity like this is important even in the capital city of Kampala, where we have rotating blackouts known affectionately as “load shedding,” during which the power is frequently off in 8- to 12-hour rotating cycles throughout the city.

He did unspeakable things to her, then reburied her when he was finished. His goal was to twist her into a submissive slave void of all independant thought, or reasoning, but in order to do that he had to break her down. He did it in two stages, the first was through physical and emotional abuse, keeping them in the box for long stretches at a time, controling everything from when they ate, to how much sleep they were allowed. This made them malliable and easy to manipulate.

The most important idea extracted from Cheek’s book is that the CCP and the PRC are one. The way in which the PRC was born, and the discourse used to render it the level of institution, made for a cultural incapacity to separate Party from State. In addition, the Party has used several creative means to maintain the linkage very much alive. They have done this through historical connections and discourses that appeal both to the present developments as well as the created history.
This chocolate is the second delicious item that has really impressed me. It isn't something that you can buy off the shelf like naan; it is the chocolate pie from Monument Cafe. I recently received one of these pies courtesy of Monument Cafe. I put it into the fridge without really giving it much though. Later that night, my sister came over for dinner so we broke out the pie. This is no ordinary pie. The chocolate filling is thicker than a chocolate mousse, and not too sweet. The crust is literally candied walnuts. We had this pie with 512 Brewing Pecan Porter, and it is amazing. At the next dessert and beer pairing, I will serve this pie with Pecan Porter.

We came up on one little stop about 80 to 100 miles from the town where we knew we'd need to get gas. Terry glanced down at our gauge and decided we were fine, and we kept driving. Unfortunately, the needle dropped more quickly than we were used to, seeing as how we were driving faster than normal. Thirty miles from the town, the "Low Fuel" light came on. Thirty miles is cutting it close. You will understand that the next half hour was spent in quiet solitude and gut-wrenching worry.

In bygone times taking snuff was extremely popular, its palmy days in England being during the eighteenth century. Snuff was praised in poetry and prose.

The thing about beer is that it gets written about by beer geeks so if you were to read the story of American beer you would get reams on craft beer and buggar all on the far bigger story of the success of light beer. My suspicion as to why it never took off in Europe was confusion as to the term “lite”. Is it diet beer? Light in Alcohol? Light tasting? Either way the European drinker decided that was for girls and didn’t drink it. Will light beer take off with sexier names like Gold and Chrome? God knows. If it does, a couple of mainstream brewers have found a product they can sell at a higher price and save established brands from decline. If it doesn’t we await with anticipation for the name of next light lager sold at a premium. Would I win a prize for suggesting “Carling Posh”?

They are pushing all the small businesses out.
Obviously this great crowd of riotous Jews to which Paul was speaking was made up of unbelievers. By nature, they obeyed man just as every unsaved person does. The cults are made up of people who believe and follow some who put themselves up as leaders. Seek out the religions of the world and you will see men in charge and a number of people willing to be led about by them. So it was in Jerusalem.

Among the more persistent items of writer mythology--agents are likely to steal your work, publishers aren't interested in first-time authors, you can't get an agent unless you're already published--is the notion of blacklisting. Many people fear that there's some sort of master reference list that agents and editors use to identify troublesome writers, or that agents or editors can turn a writer into an untouchable by passing his or her name around among their colleagues.

It is noteworthy that the official US patronage of the Immaculate Conception (1846) came eight years before the dogmatic definition.

One thing I learned about biking— it does say A LOT about life. For a beginner, you have to bear the pangs of pain that will shoot up your thighs as you do the first kilometer of pedal. Then at those first few distances, the temptation to stop and give up will start nagging. But of course, to heed it is stupid. Why quit when you’ve only just begun?

A biography of Dr. Muschik indicates that he’s a nice enough guy. He’s board-certified and licensed in South Carolina, a reassuring thing except for the South Carolina part. He was trained at the National University of Health Sciences in Illinois in the treatment and rehabilitation of physical injuries and advanced neurological diseases, as well as back and neck pain. He’s certified in CPR (in other words, he can press down on the front of your chest as well as on the back), he teaches youth coaches tactics in sports injury prevention, and is the official chiropractor for the Winthrop University soccer team. He is “consistently active within the community,” perhaps more than you can say about his hobbled patients whose activity levels are more subdued.

At the end of the path, we were still a long way from the moraines which terminate the glacier, which was a bit disappointing. A large gravel rock fall obscured much of the ice. Warning signs and newspaper cuttings were pinned to a board telling us of some idiot who had died trying to get a closer look and had been crushed by a serac collapsing. So we observed from a distance.
Now I'm stuck trying to end this blog post.
Which brings me to my one other suggestion. There is an extensive documentary on the incredible, troubled production of Apocalypse Now titled Hearts of Darkness that is as much a part of this story as the movies themselves. Coppola really took a whole crew into the jungle and went through an experience that left all of them scarred by it. It’s not only interesting from a film production standpoint, but by a human one, to see the director slowly unravel in interviews and recordings made on set as the pressures mounted and time took its toll. Nobody seemingly comes out of it untouched, and most of the cast are interviewed and recall it much like soldiers would recall their own experiences in war. It only drives home the reality of the film that much more to see it play out on a meta level.

We found each other years after,after a huge series of meetings than never happened,even blind dates,concerts that we both were attending but we were always missing each other.Years after all the marks on both of us were too visible,we had left our pride and our defenses aside when we were talking to each other.Our arguments fierce and our mutual trust reborn in a certain level.
I found a whole mess of packaging with no toys inside. It was just garbage. It had no value at all. So I decided to throw it away. Then I found some of those silly little toys.

Theatre in the Mill, Paper Zoo and Bradford Theatres– Theatre in the Mill is part of University of Bradford, and offers a huge and diverse range of performances with a more avant-garde bent. The performances they put on are exciting and unusual, but that shouldn’t put you off – visit their What’s On Guide and try something different for a change. I know you’ll find something you’ll be so glad you saw you’ll come back again and again. Paper Zoo theatre company was born and bred inBradford. Created by alumni ofBradfordCollege’s Acting BTEC back in 2005, they’ve gone from strength to strength. Now putting on up to three productions a year, and giving young actors their first taste of performing and touring, they were commissioned by the National Media Museum to stage Orwell’s 1984, and tempted John Hurt, who played Winston Smith on the big screen, to be Big Brother himself. Whilst I haven’t been to a production, a quick question to those who have reveal that Paper Zoo is a brilliantBradfordinstitution… and I’ll be seeing them this year! Bradford Theatres website brings together the council owned and run theatres in Bradford city centre: The Alhambra, St George’s Hall and The Studio. There’s loads on offer, from comedians and bands to plays and ballet. Don’t think you have to go far to see household names or up-and-coming talent: it’s right here on your doorstep.
The guild’s needs are slightly changing. We’re still a young guild. Today, we’re two weeks old. Even so, things are moving rapidly. We’ve had an interesting mix of responses to the Organic Roleplaying post that I put up, here, yesterday, and to which I linked on the realm forums. We’ve had very good turn outs at all of our events, so far. For those of you who are keeping count, we’ve had 5 events, including last night’s 5-Man Dungeon Night, which went well, despite getting started a little late. We still have 2 official events and one unofficial event scheduled for this week, including tonight’s Guild Roleplaying Night, tomorrow’s Guild Raid Night, and a member-organized / member-scheduled Ulduar Raid (for, inter alia, transmog gear) for Saturday night.

DC continues to talk expanded learning—the Government Accountability Office and a bipartisan group of Senators are the latest to join the conversation. Many of you probably saw the recent GAO assessment of the federal School Improvement Grant program. It’s supposed to help struggling schools turn around by increasing learning time and improving teacher evaluations, among other strategies. The GAO team concluded that “the SIG requirements to develop teacher evaluations and increase student learning time were difficult to implement quickly and effectively because they required extensive planning and coordination.”

Illustr8 was primarily an educational game company, churning out text adventures in the mid-to-late eighties, but it was their attempt to corner the market on a new fad that would lead to their dissolution and infamy. “Virtual reality” gaming experiences had been around for a year or so at the time, booths set up at state fairs and tech conventions. A lead developer for Illustr8(whose identity has never been confirmed) experienced a booth one year and brought a new idea back to his fellow developers. They would make the first “totally submersive” arcade experience, according to a memo that popped up in a few court cases.

However, I think my stress over the white boxer runs a little deeper, in part, due to the fact that there are still breeders who put them down. How horrible is that? It wasn’t too long ago that white boxers were not even recognized by the AKC. They are now, but they cannot compete as “show” dogs. They can compete in agility competitions, etc. That bothers me too. Why shouldn’t they be able to compete as show dogs? It’s not like they are breed to be all white. Basically 1 in 4 boxers born are white. It’s straight up genetics. A roll of the dice, if you will. If the boxer carries the “white spotting gene”, a litter could have a white pup. I believe that flashy boxers all carry the white spotting gene, since to be considered “flashy” there has to be white covering at least 1/3 of the body. I could be wrong, but I believe flashy boxers are recognized and can be registered with the AKC.

I’m so excited for summer, as mentioned in my last blog post. I haven’t read a whole book since January when I had almost the whole month off of school for winter break. Currently I’m working my way through Ann Voskamp’s book One Thousand Gifts. I’m still loving it so much–it’s the type of book that demands to be read slowly, savoring each drop and letting it marinate through my thoughts.
Highly disillusioned, I found solice in the QWC headquarters, where I chatted with a lovely lady behind the counter, picked up a copy of the latest AWM book, and bought a raffle ticket (I didn’t win, FYI). The few minutes I spent in the QWC office refreshed me: I was ready to go back out into the festival, and I was ready to put that rather unusual panel behind me (after about an hour of serious bitching between Ali and myself over coffee (on Ali’s part) and water (on my part) and countless cigarettes (on both our parts)).
Police not autonomous from the government; heightened armed police presence; rising police abuses; video surveillance and community cameras; control of mainstream media; criminalization of society; arbitrary search and seizure; civilian complaint mechanism against the police deliberately undermined by the state; antiterrorism measures that violate basic human rights; radio frequency identification; surveillance legislation; clandestine internet, cell phone, telephone and mail monitoring; data bases of personal information; firearm confiscation and prohibition; martial law; mass arrests; arbitrary ‘preventative’ detention; carrying and providing identification ‘papers’ when challenged by police or deputized private security agents; degrading distinction between the law and the exercise of political power by the executive; enacting ‘secret’ laws behind closed doors; restrictions on civil mobility; and encroachments on the democratic freedom to express or communicate political or other views.
Yesterday we enjoyed a very warm day. We talked about Spring and all of the wonderful things about it. We went on a long walk to the park, we made little birds in a nest, planted seeds, weeded the garden, and read some books about Spring.

Megan Abbott has done something few of us can dream of. She’s taken everything we know about noir fiction and re-framed it in a world almost alien to the genre. She has imbued it with a command and grace that compels while meeting our expectation of entering the dark and forbidding places of the human psyche.
Not long after, I opened our garage door a crack so the cat could have some shelter during the night and I smelled smoke. Thick in the air, but no idea where it was coming from. I ran upstairs to tell Craig, who, at this point was snuggled cozily into bed and didn’t want to get back out. After a thorough check of our house, including the attic, Craig ventured outside in the pouring rain to find smoke billowing out of our darling neighbor’s A/C units.

The bulk of the suspicion for these "accidents" is placed squarely on the delicate shoulders of Michael's former brother-in-law David (Merritt Butrick), the spa's resident computer expert. Why, you ask, does a health spa have a computer expert? Well, you see, everything at Starbody Health Spa is run by a kind of super computer, one that takes up an entire room, and David, it seems, is the only one who knows how to operate the complex behemoth.

The Toulouse murders are a State operation designed to create sympathy for Israel for the coming war. The modus operandi of a biker opening fire on civilians is straight out of the MOSSAD handbook. The murder of scientists in Iran by men on motorbikes was a MOSSAD operation. Having found this tactic to be so successful in Iran, they have simply transferred it to France.

“Girls” is, in other words, a particularly galling example of tokenism, in which the only unsung voices we’re allowed to hear are the ones that fit the other prejudices of the people operating the sound system. Just as it’s not progress in representations of people of color if the only ones we see are drug dealers or welfare moms, it’s not progress in representations of women if the only ones we see aren’t all that different from the Carrie Bradshaws to whom we’ve already been overexposed. By all means, if people find this show interesting and entertaining, they should watch. But they shouldn’t be telling the world that it’s some sort of feminist triumph when there’s so, so much else that’s wrong with it.

“If I were asked about the withdrawal, I would say to politicians: The U.S. army must stay until the Iraqi army is fully ready in 2020,” Zebari told reporters at a Baghdad news conference. His comments were carried by London-based Channel 4 News and several other media.

One thing is for sure between these two contenders, however; both teams are more alike than different. Both were threatened with relocation (and Phoenix is still fighting it off) to Hamilton, Ontario from now former Co-CEO of Research in Motion, Jim Balsillie. Nashville almost met the fate of Canada back in 2007, but luckily, loyal Predators fans were able to nip that decision quickly in the bud. The Coyotes, who are a currently owned by the NHL, are purely at the mercy of the City of Phoenix, who currently pays to keep the team in near by Glendale, Arizona.

I waited in the hallway for them to come back so that I could see if they needed help, I still had not gone to my apartment yet, I felt a bit sensitive about their situation & I wanted to offer my help without offending them or anything; but I think that I heard Flynn saying something as they were walking back to their apartment, that caused me to decide to avoid having them see me & so I walked off to hide.

I love these figures, as they are so typical of African-American gangstas, for whom attitude is everything. These figures are so full of character and beautifully sculpted. They are crying out to be teamed up with Bobby Jackson's Thugz. Scale purists will be pleased to know that these figures are true 28mm scale. You can buy each figure separately for £3.00 each or £2.00 for the Doberman, but a better deal is to buy all six as a group for £12.00, saving you £5.00. Next time, I'll take a look at their female counterparts, the Sun Valley Bulldog Babes.
Weeping Underwater Looks A Lot Like Laughter by Michael J. White ($15.00, Berkley, softcover) will further enhance the author’s reputation as one of Barnes & Noble’s Discover Great New Writers for spring 2010. Teenager George Flynn and his family have just moved to Des Moines, Iowa and, on their first night in town, a young woman is murdered at the hotel in which they are staying. Is it an omen of things to come? By turns witty, charming, and heart-wrenching, this is the debut novel about a young man coming of age under the toughest of circumstances. It is a story of first lovers, unrequited emotions, second lovers, family secrets, and the untold truths that lurk in one’s heart years and years after they’re grown. George’s life will be influenced by the Schell sisters. He is immediately smitten with one, Emily, his classmate and peer, and the perfect counterpoint to her sister, Katie, who has been diagnosed with a baffling case of multiple sclerosis. You will want to go along to learn how these three deal with life’s challenges and upheavals. Finally, for sheer laughter and fun, pick up a copy of Blotto, Twinks and the Ex-King’s Daughter by Simon Brett, the first of a series based on two of these characters ($14.95, Felony & Mayhem Press, softcover). Brett is best known for cozy mysteries set in a little English town as one of the grand old men of British mystery since 1975. Set in the 1920s we are introduced to siblings, Blotto, a handsome fellow whose low on brain power, and Twinks, his beautiful and brilliant sister. The result is that rarest of genres, a genuinely funny crime story when the daughter of the exiled king of Mittleleuropa is kidnapped on a visit to Tawcester Towers.

Imagine a modern spin on Mary Shelley's Frankenstein where a young couple's undying love and the grief of a father pushed beyond sanity could spell the destruction of them all. A string of suspicious deaths near a small Michigan town ends with a fall that claims the life of Emma Gentry's boyfriend, Daniel. Emma is broken, a hollow shell mechanically moving through her days. She and Daniel had been made for each other, complete only when they were together. Now she restlessly wanders the town in the late Fall gloom, haunting the cemetery and its white-marbled tombs, feeling Daniel everywhere, his spectre in the moonlight and the fog.

When one is traveling then it is important to be observant about your environment. It is important to blend in and go beyond the tourist circuit. I have seen some people who get very comfortable talking to local people and mingle with them whereas there are many others who are just interested in looking at buildings. At some level, I am telling myself that if I were to become a writer some day then it is important to pack bags and go around the world and mix with different people and cultures.

The stakes at Copenhagen, in other words, were rather different from those discussed in the media, and the outcome could have been predicted from the debacle six years earlier at Cancun. When it became clear to the major players that the United States and its allies were not going to get what they wanted, the entire process fell apart, leaving China to seize the initiative and offer a face-saving compromise that committed neither bloc to any limits that matter. Afterwards, since climate change had failed to keep the BRIC nations at bay, the US dropped the issue like a hot rock; the financial hangover of the housing bubble made climate change lose its appeal to the Democratic Party; and activists suddenly discovered that what they thought was a rising groundswell of support was simply the result of being temporarily funded and used for somebody else’s political advantage.

I’ve never been any good at holding a grudge, though I have admittedly tried. In the past, I have been more apt to forgive easily. Some would say too easily. The problem was not that I forgave, it was that I also forgot, which meant that I stayed in bad relationships too long, or looked past completely unacceptable behavior, which kept me wide open for hurt after hurt, and certainly to abuse. There is a middle ground, I believe. We can forgive, let go of anger, hurts, and bitterness, and still remember that the behavior and actions were awful, and that we did not deserve that type of treatment. We can then make healthy choices about who we keep in our lives, and who we do not. Keeping anger in our lives is never healthy, nor is holding grudges, yet may people do, to their great detriment.
Josh and I are on a mini-tour through a part of the country that I really hadn't spent much time in before. Two nights ago we were in St. Louis and had a great time with some musician friends. Yesterday we drove through some pretty intense weather in Missouri and into Oklahoma (right now we're crossing our fingers that a tornado isn't heading this way). I forced him to pull over when we passed through Springfield, MO because I knew the Red Velvet Vintage boutique is there! I've been following their blog, A Beautiful Mess for a long time so was very excited to see the brick-and-mortar store. It was very cute and well-merchandised, full of very nice, reasonably-priced pieces but not so packed that it's hard to look at everything. I have always said that if I ever open a store it will look like Urban Outfitters but be filled with unique vintage pieces. The RV boutique definitely fits that description! It actually reminded me a lot of a smaller version of the Blitz vintage "department store" in London.

For those of you who don’t have children or for those of you who are sane (basically the same thing) there is a relatively new Christmas phenomenon that’s hit the streets of which you are probably unfamiliar. It’s called the Elf on a Shelf and in a nutshell, an elf (one of those creepy ones from the 1950′s with the plastic face) sits on a shelf in your house and while your children sleep, he returns to the North Pole and reports back whether the kids have been good or bad. Apparently this goes on for the entire month of December.

Aggressive abuse can also take a more indirect form and may even be disguised as “helping.” Criticizing, advising, offering solutions, analyzing, probing, and questioning another person may be a sincere attempt to help. In some instances, however, these behaviors may be an attempt to belittle, control, or demean rather than help. The underlying judgmental “I know best” tone the abuser takes in these situations is inappropriate and creates unequal footing in peer relationships.
We’ve finally reached the end of what was probably the most tumultuous season ever on the Biggest Loser. We had three players quit, more fighting than I can even remember and drama to fill more stages than Shakespeare. But what fun it’s been to watch! Tonight we find out who wins the major prize, a quarter of a million dollars! Plus they will award the one hundred thousand dollar at-home prize and the winner of the PALA (Presidential Active Living Award) campaign for the hometown gym.

Even reporting your sickness needed a very careful choice of words. For instance, if you had been injured during beatings by the "commanders", you were not supposed to say that you had been beaten.

Oh that may not be their intent, but regardless of how good their intentions are that will be the result if they succeed. Even a novice of history like me can see that clearly.

They are AWFUL!! Never mind the horrible taste and after taste but they are really, really bad for your body. Splenda in particular reduces the good bacteria in your intestines, stimulates your appetite, kills your brains cells (because its so much sweeter than sugar) and on and on. Click here for an article to get you started...... Please, please, PLEASE do not put this terrible chemical into your body. In fact, avoid it and others (Nutra Sweet, Truvia, Equal) as all costs. If you want more info, just google for more information. But beware of where it's coming from, the makers of Splenda say it's fine. Hmmm......
i just bought the ice cream sandwiches at Target then saw them on clearance yesterday – sad!
Davis: I see the whole question of epidemic control and biosecurity being modeled after immigration control. That’s the reigning paradigm right now. Of course, it’s a totally false analogy – particularly when you deal with something like influenza, which can’t be quarantined. You can’t build walls against it. Biosecurity, in a globalized world that contains as much poverty and squalor as our urban world does, is impossible. There is no biosecurity. The continuing quest will be to achieve the biological equivalent of a gated community, with the control of movement and with regulations that just enforce all the most Orwellian tendencies – the selective creation and provision of vaccines, anti-virals, and so on.

All three themes have been prevalent since the start of this adventure. Grilled cheese I, of course, knew would come up quite a bit in an exploration of food and health at a vendor that exclusively sells cheesy sandwiches.

This has sod all to do with beer. It’s about people. This afternoon I was invited to join a lottery syndicate by my work colleagues. What has to be the single most retarded lottery syndicate on the face of this earth. Lotteries by large are for idiots. I know the idea that somebody wins it but when you look at the odds then actually no it’s not going to be you. You have a greater chance of being knocked over by a bus than winning the lottery. That’s even if you never left the house because a bus just might pile through your living room, even if your road isn’t on a bus route. You never know.
If someone believes that God does exists, but does not go to church, or believe in the bible, or in an after life in Heaven or Hell, are they called an Agnostic, because I know an Agnostic is someone who does not know if there is or is not a god.

The essay was prompted by the acquittal of the army doctor accused of performing “virginity-tests” on women activists arrested during a demonstration. This outcome highlights that Egypt’s widespread culture of sexual harassment will be a tough cancer to control. Men feel entitled to the behavior and blame women for it; even secular women will blame themselves for it; moreover, it is a government practice.
What Owen is picking up on is that all throughout the bible, the heart is considered to be the core of a person; decisions come from the heart, thoughts and emotions come from the heart. Our very being and person is found in the heart. But the problem with our heart is that sin has poisoned it. God tells us in Jeremiah 17:9 that our heart is ‘…deceitful above all things, and desperately corrupt.’ This is a hard truth. But it is the truth.
I showed Matt a bunch of very rough sketches for the CD cover illustration, but he was really taken by one that was a literal depiction of "a man versus concrete," so I did a better version of it and that was that. Then we talked about that silly hospital chase scene in Star Trek 4 (Matt said it was too much like the Keytone Cops, and I agreed, but I said that was probably because of the light, non-threatening music that completely undermines any sense of real suspense that scene could have had).

One of the saddest days in my life was when he went off to college and left me in Buffalo. But he also deigned to have me come and visit him in Ann Arbor, and I had a wonderful time – we had a wonderful time together, and I felt for a minute that we were equals as we just did the normal college things that normal college freshmen did in those days, you know, we studied hard and I helped him with his homework! He took me to see Herbie Hancock and Freddie Hubbard; it was pretty great.

Down in West Texas the Eastwood girls have silenced all doubters as they are the undeniable #1 team in the El Paso area. The Eastwood boys have been THE biggest and nicest surprise this season as they have finished no worse than 3rd (at the big Lubbock Invite) and have won twice. Right now they, along with Montwood, are the co-leaders as the top team in the city. Top runner Juan Blanco, who ran a great 15:52 in Lubbock, has had the luxury of having his teammates step up and run close to him.

The Trades District sounds more chic than it is: a collection of shabby buildings and sand roads, which are mostly deserted. The coach pulls up near #352. The brothers get out to scout ahead, leaving the Paladin and Cleric behind: sneaking is not one of their virtues.

Julia Cameron's The Right to Write and The Sound of Paper -- Julia Cameron has been known as a kind of creativity guru for decades, helping all kinds of writers overcome writer's block. Her most famous and widely read book, The Artist's Way, was born out of those lectures and teachings. One of her main exercises is for writers to write 30 morning pages every day, no matter what. It doesn't have to be your work in progress (or WIP) or an article you are working on. Just get those 30 pages done and you will train yourself (like an athlete) to become accustomed to churning the work out every day. She also advocates taking yourself out on Artist Dates -- a time when you and your artistic sensibilities (or "muse") are treated to some time together. It could be a 20 minute walk or a trip to a museum. Anything to get those creative juices flowing.

Now correct me if I’m wrong, but aren’t our bridesmaids supposed to be our closest and most-valued loved ones? Ok, so there may be a future sister-in law or annoying cousin in there as well, but generally, don’t we want to dress our bestest ladies in something that makes them feel comfortable, happy and, well, like them? This notion of not wanting the bridesmaids to look better than the bride is utterly ridiculous. As if anyone will be radiating more joy, love and gorgeousness on the wedding day than the bride herself. (And I truly mean that; no-one goes to a wedding and looks forward to seeing what the bridesmaids are going to wear- it’s all about the bride, right?)
Ok so after I got my class prep done and laundry done and emails done, I felt that I could guilt-lessly sit down and begin to play with my NEW Silhouette Cameo machine. Thanks to all my FB friends who have been giving me tips & tricks, I sure appreciate it! And I will say this FOR SURE was easier than my Cricut…I easily chose a few images from the HUGE Silhouette Library (I subscribed for $14.99 a month which gets me 50 images a month, any over that are only 75 cents each). They loaded right into the Silhouette Studio softward on my laptop and I was ready to go! I love, love that I don’t have to purchase cartridges to then only use 5 images off the cartridge know what I mean! Then after a small blade glitch…apparently I hadn’t pushed it down all the way LOL and it was ready to go. Now I didn’t do anything incredibly difficult yet but I’m gonna take my online classes first before I go merging images and such hee hee so I learn CORRECTLY! But so far I’m loving it and boy it’s lightweight too and slim….I love that its not as bulky and heavy like the Cricut was (anyone want a Cricut…I gotta sell my Expression for like $50 LOL?) So if you are on the fence about getting one…research it and watch my blog cuz’ I’ll be using it a lot and you know I’m always honest..butt honest about what it can do and my mess-ups hee hee. So far 6 of my friends have ordered one too LOL…let’s see if any of you all will join me in the Silhouette Craze!!!??? (Tinnnnna)

However, I absolutely HATE being in an LDR with my family. When I used to live in Chicago, my family and I would road trip to Minneapolis every weekend– it was like having a family reunion every weekend. For most people, having 30+ people under the same roof sounds dreadful, but I wish I could have it every day. Our family has grown a lot since then (where each family reunion consists of about 45-50 people in the same house per gathering), and people have slowly started branching out from Minnesota, so these functions only happen once or twice a year these days… Thank God for Facebook!

As the year 2011 draws to a close we need to sit-up and consider what lies ahead in 2012. Now I don't care whether you're a conspiracy theorist believing the world is ruled by Jews and ugly old men attending Free Mason meeting in dark little rooms, whether you believe the Chinese are colonising Africa (or the world for that matter) and supporting the radical terrorist movements in driving the whites from Africa, whether you're Christian, a Muslim or an Atheist. Frankly I do not care whether you consider yourself a Boer a Dutchman, an Afrikaner or a proud white South African, whether your home language is Portuguese, German, Dutch, Afrikaans or English. I don't care if you came here five years ago or whether your forefathers came here 300 years ago. I also do not care whether you're a liberal, an appeaser or a conservative fundamentalist right-winger.
In 1900, AK was as common a beer name as IPA, especially in the South. Cheaper than full-strength PA, it was often one a brewery's best-selling beers. Only one remains: McMullen's AK. I can remember just one other being around in my drinking life, Hole's (later Courage) AK, brewed in Newark. So where did they all go?

I viewed “The Bang Bang Club” movie for the first time in my life when it was recently screened on SABC 3. I almost lost interest when the movie opened with the following untruthful words on the screen, but I also realized that the words were placed there to make the film more appealing to a broader audience:

Mr Wight was called as a Crown witness formally, but this as a courtesy to Mr Sheridan.

No executions are scheduled at this time in Virginia, which has executed more people than any state except Texas since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Dieter said the federal government and all 34 death penalty states use lethal injection, although some have other methods available as backup. In Virginia, condemned inmates are allowed to choose between injection and electrocution. If they decline to choose, they get the injection.

Persuasive as that argument sounds, college is not the best choice for everyone. One of the most overlooked choices is the trades. Originally, “the trades” meant becoming a skilled blue-collar worker – a carpenter, electrician, plumber, machinist or mechanic.

Two managers, Sea Goats and Shagging Flys, didn't even make it to the draft. And, frankly, they wound up with really good teams each. Maybe that was the way to go. Kinda disconcerting, seeing two teams that are probably better than my own that were picked by a computer. That's the way it goes sometimes. The Sea Goats wound up with the incredible Albert Pujols and an outfield of Curtis Granderson, Carlos Gonzalez and Nelson Cruz. All players I coveted. Same with Shagging Flys and Miggy Cabrera, although his outfield is littered with the often-injured Josh Hamilton, Carl Crawford and BJ Upton. A starting rotation of Dan Haren and Cole Hamels helps offet that extremely well.

His first hoax, early in October of 1862, was an article about a Petrified Man found in the Nevada desert east of Virgina City. Twain describes a prospector with a wooden leg who was found turned to stone at a place called Gravelly Ford. He describes the man's position, and if any of his readers had bothered to adopt the pose – or even mentally visualise it – they would have realised immediately that Twain was joshing them. (He even signed that article "Josh") One of his main aims in writing this hoax piece was to vex an enemy of his, a man named George Sewall with whom he was feuding. And he succeeded. People generally do not expect the printed word to be an outright lie.

Elsewhere in my apartment pools of water have formed on top of the linoleum but luckily none are near any electrical devices and my dirty clothes hamper remains untouched.

Instead I decide to deal with it in the morning.

Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the berries are very tender and the sauce is slightly thickened, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat, and let cool. Refrigerate until cold before using.

Val continues working for XXXXXXXXXX, out of California. Since she works from her home office, over the Internet, it is hard to beat her commute. She is a Sunday school teacher to the preschool class this year. It can be quite a challenge. Activities and demonstrations are a big part of the class. They have ranged from splashing sinks full of water to demonstrate the parting of the Red Sea, to a “talking” stuffed gorilla, answering Bible questions. She is enjoying it and apparently learning a lot. Val is still active with the American Sewing Guild, ASG, and is the quarterly newsletter editor. Her sewing projects have included two formal dresses for Maddy, Sweet Heart Ball and Prom (because you can’t wear the same dress twice), Tiffany’s wedding dress, bridesmaid dresses, and various Christmas gifts. She entered the Prom dress in the State Fair and won 2nd place in the Special Occasions division.
As silly as it may sound, books with titles beginning with the letter “A” may be more visible than a book which begins with the letter “Z.” Many Websites and Blogs have sidebar lists of the books they enjoy or recommend to their Website visitors. Some of these create their lists in alphabetical order; placing your book which begins with the letter A at the top of the list. Top listings receive 17% more hits than lower placed listings.
After just a few minutes of Googling, followed by some hurried IMs with a guy calling himself "Brother SelloutImust," we discovered the real cause of the fire: one monk (we’ll call him “Wholier Then Thou”) reneged on a deal he signed with the Devil back in July of 1987 for... yup, you guessed it - his soul. Details of their back room deal are sketchy, but Brother SelloutImust swears (profusely) that it involved pole dancers, fruit roll ups, and a clown suit.

Grandma Jeanne flew to Kentucky to help pack up the house. In between me being nauseous and tired we packed and packed. We had many fabulous friends who pitched in and helped watch Reagan and also pack things at our house. To alleviate some of the traveling tolls on Reagan and I we decided to fly straight to Utah instead of driving across the country. Sterling and Jeanne took on the tremendous responsibility of driving the 26 foot Uhaul with the car trailer on the back all the way to Colorado Springs. They had a set back outside of Louisville with the Uhaul that set them back several hours. We hired Two Men and a Truck to unload our stuff into storage. Jeanne flew home to Portland, and Sterling and Annie drove to Utah with the car. We were only able to spend a day and a half together before Sterling had to fly back to Kentucky:(

Do you remember GIGO? Garbage in, garbage out. Pastor husband and I were watching Cartoon Network with the boys this morning and there was a commercial for Kidz Bop. Well, we've had experience with Kidz Bop before; a little over a year ago McDonalds was giving KB cds in kids meals. Pastor and I listened to it and promptly tossed both cds in the trash. It was adult themed music sung by children. It was completely inappropriate for children! The commercial this morning had Lady Gaga on it! OMW! Really? Lady Gaga for children?? Why oh why would parents let their children listen to that??

In Winter’s Shadow completes Gillian Bradshaw’s Arthurian trilogy, begun in Hawk of May (reviewed here earlier) and continued in Kingdom of Summer (reviewed here earlier). The central characters are Gwynhwyfar, her husband King Arthur, and Arthur’s chief commander Bedwyr. Other important characters are familiar from the legends, including Arthur’s illegitimate son Medraut and the warriors Gwalchmai (later Sir Gawain) and Cei. Fictional characters from the earlier books, including Gwalchmai’s servant Rhys and his wife Eivlin and Medraut’s companion Rhuawn, also reappear here.

Wow.. It sure feels good to be back! WordPress is like a home, in a thin air that hangs somewhere between your High head and warm heart. What a month or rather year that has dawned on this side of the world! I no longer live in my year old home, my car is gone and so is my partner. I have already relocated twice, will be shifting again tomorrow and still would take another 2 months to finally reach where I need to be. I haven’t lived with my parents in 10 years but now I am living with my In-laws. It sure feels funny.
Now, I know there are many authors with cartoon style OTT violence. Anthony Horowitz, Robert Muchamore, it is a long list, I may have even done it myself. People(boys and girls) love it. But within those books we know it's not real. 15 year olds are not really spies, your reader knows this, he knows he is reading escapism. I have no problem with that.
Leaving people like Gary with a professional stalemate to try to adequately and efficiently treat his patients when they want to be treated. It would be unjustifiable to agree that a completely health based solution is the answer to the decriminalising of drugs.

As you know, I was one of the contributing authors for Margaret McSweeney's book, Pearl Girls (available here). 100% of the proceeds from the sale of this inspiring book are going to Hands of Hope and Wings, two very worthwhile organizations.

Wings provides safe houses for women and children fleeing domestic violence, job training and placement, transitional housing, hope, and so much more for those in the Chicagoland area.

Jashi pushed her Warding ahead of them and again Pevan could watch as the Wildhawk slammed into it. No mistaking the greater force of the collision this time; no lazy roll from the Wilder. Instead, the thing's body spasmed, its shining wings snapping open as it trumpeted again. Pevan felt Jashi shudder as the Second-Realm part of the creature's scream brushed over them. The sound pressed on her brain, clouded her vision, dizzied her for an instant.

That happened to me a few times on this trip. I was surprised at how in reality both the sanctuary and the social hall are much smaller than memory serves. They look the same, they are lovely, just smaller than I remember.

Sarah Pinborough – Diary Entry #1
I have been looking at a 100 amp alternator which means a bank of batteries with about 400 amp hour capacity. Not sure exactly how I will fit all those batteries into the boat. At any rate Defender has a sale on that will save me about 30%. I just wish I could look at the engine and reassure myself that the alternator will fit. I am trying to ascertain if I have the right one with them and by looking at Perkins stock alternators online.
There were some very nice comments on the pomegranates, both on the blog and otherwise. And several folks mentioned they'd like to make some. So here are the two references I used, both found on the internet, of course! Have fun!

and was proudly showing photos of the big buck he gamed this year. Just so you know, I DO NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF SHOOTING ANY ANIMALS,but my son has a good heart in every way. He just enjoys the sport of hunting. He firmly believes it is Gods way of keeping the deer from starving from being over populated. So even though I don't agree, it is his decision. I love him unconditionally!

If you haven't seen it yet, go now. Don't pass go, just leave work tonight and go. I loved the books and while the movie wasn't quite as good, it was still awesome on it's own. Mike really liked the movie and he had never read the books.
What are some of the consequences of having Monsanto’s foxes guarding our food safety hen house? The following alerts are a couple of examples of Taylor & Vilsack’s worst crimes, followed by an action link to put pressure on President Obama to drop these guys before the 2012 election.
My love for the arts don’t just stop at drawing and painting. I’ve actually explored architecture in my senior year of highschool. I really wanted to become an architect and my dad had a construction company so it was perfect, but then again my dad had different plans.
Thank you for the visit
Obviously if I’m asking five people to read my work and comment on it, for nothing more than an acknowledgement in the book and a free copy when it is published I need to give something back. I did think about setting something up that worked like a baby-sitting circle. But this could be complex to organise and it might mean you work with the same people all of the time which could lead to a “house style” that may or may not be right. An element of randomness is probably welcome.

This information states clearly that Obama’s father was NEVER a U.S. Citizen.

Doctors also emphasize that the pills of today are innocuous compared to the early versions of birth control. The older generation of pills contained significantly more estrogen and physicians admit these were capable of causing weight gain. I have an issue with this threshold reasoning. You see it often with food ingredient research “at these levels there is no cause for concern.” Concern is concern and my thought is that today’s pills range in their hormone content and who’s to say what dose produces what effects in certain people. The reason studies may not tease out obvious trends is that everyone’s system reacts differently. A Mayo Clinic piece mentions that estrogen can make adipose cells larger but not more numerous. Larger fat cells = weight gain.
This morning as I marked off my checklist, I realized I was feeling sad. I didn’t get all the laundry and housework done. I didn’t get out and have fun. There were no particularly defining moments that I wanted to etch in my brain. There were no apologies needed for drunken behaviour either. Hell, I didn’t even so much as touch a drop of alcohol (not that it’s important that I do, but hey, it was the weekend and normally I do have a drink or two).
"That they were probably smoking crack through a lightbulb," I replied. My stock answer. "Fuck, me five years ago most likely would recognize the me here and now."
I withdrew my novella from the Polari Prize after Paul Burston outed me. I didn't think he could read my work properly through that red mist of his. And anyway, I think it is just too gay for me and my novella. At the end of my story the woman in it asks her male companion:

I started with a couple of sheets of cardstock and scrapbook paper and a clothespin for each kid. As you can tell I kept with my color coding system: blue for Henry, green for Grant, and orange for Eli.
For my birthday, I asked my husband for the money to make an organized art closet...he was more than happy to (and I think a little relieved that he didn't need to shop for a present!:), plus the handyman that he is, he even shopped, measured and installed the 2 new mdf board shelves. He's such a good man!
Wrong. Daly and LSP are back, with a new website that includes many of the same books (apparently, when the bankruptcy trustee decided to abandon assets, he didn't order return of rights to authors) as well as a new line called Coffee Break Reads. Naturally, the website--which blandly proclaims that LSP is "A publisher who believes in timeless tradition, using modern technology"--gives no hint of LSP's or Daly's earlier troubles.
Before honoring Joanie's living will, Matt must gather her friends and family to say their final goodbyes, a difficult situation made worse by the sudden discovery that there is one person who hasn't been told: the man with whom Joanie had been having an affair, quite possibly the one man she ever truly loved. Forced to examine what he owes not only to the living but to the dead, Matt takes to the road with his daughters to find his wife's lover, a memorable journey that leads to both painful revelations and unforeseen humor and growth.

I have no idea what result Sunday's poll will bring - most probably the need for a second round of voting to get a clear result - but I do know that we're all suffering from a chronic form of pre-election fatigue, otherwise known as:
They used to endanger their lives, used to do wonders and extraordinary deeds being sure of Allah’s Help, depending upon Hls Promise as it happened in the Islamic army under the commandership of Said bin Abi Waqqas. He stood in front of the town of AlMidian and could not find any ship or boat (it became completely impossible for him to find anything of that sort) and the water of the river Tigris (‘Iraq) increased tremendously with overflooding (its water became dark) and it overthrew its foam from excessive water in it. Sa’d addressed the people (troops) over its bank (saying): “I have resolved to cross this sea (great river) in order to assault them (the enemy).” They (the people) replied: “May Allah direct us and you to follow the right path. So please do it.” Then he (Sa’d) rushed heedlessly into the (river) Tigris with his horse and all the people (his troops) too rushed heedlessly into it (Tigris) and not a single man remained behind from him; so they marched over it as if they were marching over the surface of the earth, till they filled it (the space) between its two banks and one could not see the water surface from the cavalry and the footsoldiers. The people spoke to one another over the surface of water as they used to speak to one another over the surface of earth. So when the Persians (army) saw them they said: Diwana… Diwana, i.e. mad people… mad people). By Allah! You are not fighting against human beings, but against jinns.” On that Sa’d (raa) started saying: “Allah is Sufficient for us and He is the Best Disposer (for our affairs); by Allah! Surely Allah (swt) will give victory to His friends; verily, Allah will make superior His Religion, and verily Allah will defeat (over power) His enemy, as long as there are neither adulterers nor committers of those (similar evil) sins in the army (Sa’d's troops), then the good deeds will overcome the evil.”

My point is, we should all ask ourselves what would we do if one of our loved ones, a beloved pet, or even a stranger needs emergency medical care?
At the moment prints have been made of Baba Yaga, Snowflight Under the Seasky, Anja in the Horse Chestnut, A Girl Mad As Birds, Father Christmas and The Goods & Chattels Man, and they've all been hand embellished (i.e. signed, titled and numbered) by me. This edition of fine prints is all roughly at the size the originals were painted, which in the case of Anja in the Horse Chestnut means almost A1.
Today, scientist can state with confidence that well chosen vegetarian diets can meet nutrient needs whilst still supporting health superbly. Such evidence is not easy to obtain though.

A great example of a running pop commercial campaign would be the E*Trade baby. The first couple commercials we thought were great and everyone enjoyed watching them. They were commercials about stocks, but we all watched them for the shock value of that talking baby. The ones that I could watch over and over are the one where one baby sings “Broken Wings” while the other baby talks or the two that where about using the iPad and a Smartphone while he is in “solitary confinement.”

One thing I did change was that I used fabric instead of scrapbook paper. I only had Mod Podge and it works way better on fabric than paper- plus, now my rulers match the mini-curtains in my room!
Subconsciously your brain is working against you every second of the day. Well what does this mean? Do you pack a gallon jug of water with you to work out with?

Chat up your mates and spend time staring at the chicas?

Ronnie handles what he sees as a potential for trouble in his usual fashion – he hangs up on her. Unfortunately, KXLA’s address can be Googled. Before Ronnie can make a clean getaway, Kellie shows up at the station. It turns out she’s not so bad looking, so Ronnie begrudgingly agrees to help Kellie prove Flynn was snuffed by what he sniffed.
I don’t know why he feels the need to downplay what happened to everyone because when its just us he as no problem saying ” As hard as I knocked you into the Cabinet you should have a big gash” lucky for him I don’t bruise easilly.

It was a real pleasure to make this dress and I had a lot of fun trying to recreate Joanie's overall look for the pictures. I've also really enjoyed following everybody else's progress and reading all the research other bloggers have been doing into different character's looks. This has probably been the most enjoyable challenge I've been involved in so far - I've had a big grin on my face during the whole process! So massive thanks must be given to Julia Bobbin for organising such an interesting and fun challenge. Don't forget to check out her blog from 1st April, where she'll be showcasing all the other amazing Mad Men dresses that have been created worldwide. I can't wait to see them all.

Back to spring. Its presence allows me to happily dream of spending eight hours a day working in the summer vegetable garden. I know that there will be months of hard work before we eat our first tomato in spite of the fact that they are already planted. I know that some vegetables that I spend hours planting and tending will do their best to disappoint me. I have only to think about the Three Sisters Garden that I toiled over last year. I spent weeks preparing the planting bed and months tending to the beans, squash, and corn only to end up with nothing more than a handful of beans and a few corn husks to show for it.
Thanks to Prof. Ecks (who you can find here–>http://77dosesofecks.wordpress.com/) I found a new idea. To do a new song every day. Of course he doesn’t have a schedule or set rules. I need some. So this will me the schedule (I’ll add to it as I go). It will start May 18 and end August 1. I don’t know how many days that is, but it’s pretty long. I’ll delete my previous posts of songs, so you have to follow my song journey. :)

This art is really about youthful ideals gone horribly wrong. It is the product of White kids that are privileged enough to choose to live like bohemians. All the hating of the Bush and the War and America probably has a lot more to do with hating parents and growing up. This art also detracts from anyone with a liberal point of view making an intelligent point. Sort of like Jeanine Garafalo getting involved in the 2004 election.
Towards the end I’ll be taking some of the more general points I have been making and illustrating how they inform relationships with customers, using some of these businesses as examples.

Russell the Sheep well I doubled over giggling my head off....people up the isle looking at me...:)~ go one like I worry about that...so...I pick it up and open it up and start reading it out loud, (how else are you going to read a kids book?) I can't stop laughing..serendipity rides again...I go looking for Russell..and I find him..and now I love this little sheep... I took him to work today and read him out loud, showed all the pictures, and pointed out Franklin... whom I had to go online to find out his name...it is not said outright in this book...I even got a couple clients to read it while they were waiting to see the Vet. Now we all know about Russell and I can't wait to go see Mable and Splat, and the rest of the lovely things from Rob Scotton's mind :)

Like I said, I don’t even see me anymore. I don’t feel like a person. I have no identity. I have nothing.
When we reduce our gospel story to a moral lesson we are not helping our kids. That will only make them self-righteous little Pharisees. Even Jesus condemned the Pharisees for reading the Old Testament to find rules to follow (John 5:29; Matt. 23:1-39). Wouldn’t it be so much more glorious to tell our kids how the Bible is really one story with one Hero who has done for us all the things we are incapable of accomplishing for ourselves?
Brothers and Sisters this year, let us start to be generous to someone. Not only to your relatives and friends but to anyone that needs our help. And I firmly believe that God will REPLACE all things that we have lost and fill it with so much more that it OVERFLOWS.. You cannot outdone God’s generosity… You cannot compete with Him… If you are generous, guess what? He is MORE generous than you.

I look her and I am grateful that so far she has been an easy teenager, and I still can’t quite believe where the years have gone. She has always been an easy child, bright and inquisitive she demanded a lot of attention in her early years but once she learned to read the answers to most of her questions could be found in books. Nowadays, I am the one who asks her questions, she is like a sponge and has an never-ending supply of knowledge though frequently in her imitable teenage manner I will be told to “just Google it, Mum.”

Of all the flowers in the garden, the sunflower is surely the one most readily associated with the long, leisurely, picnic-filled days of summertime. Most of my sunflowers have either faded and drooped their lovely faces towards the soil or have been cleared away during the last week due to their extremely brown and crispy appearance. As this gloriously welcome hot weekend dawned over the veg patch on Saturday morning, there are two sunflower plants still putting on a show. By standing on a wall, I could just about photograph this one; with the sun shining through the petals, I was struck by how beautiful the back of the flower is. It seemed an appropriate view to symbolise the last of the summer.

December 1 was World AIDS Day. Mike texted me to see if I could help him cover the day's events and help him take photos of the celebration, awards and speakers. Of course, I got there as soon as I could. I have photos to share that I'll be uploading soon. What I will try to relate as well is the feeling of incredible love and hope that exists today for those on the forefront of fighting AIDS and discrimination for HIV+ people. What I learned about this disease, now in the 25th year since its discovery, shook me deeply and also made my eyes fill with tears of compassion for the people who live with this illness on some level daily.

Family and Friends: Best friends were Wally Cleaver and Clarence "Lumpy" Rutherford. His parents were George and Agnes, though his father's name has sparked a minor controversy. Eddie called himself Edward Clark Haskell, Jr. in one episode--implying Dad's name was Edward. In another episode, Eddie referred to his father as Frank. In The New Leave It to Beaver, the grown-up Eddie's sons were Freddie and Bomber (played by Ken Osmond's real-life kids). As a child, Eddie had a dog named Wolf. Eddie's girlfriends included Christine Staples (played by Marta Kristen from Lost in Space), Caroline Schuster (who actually thought Eddie was a creep), and Cindy Andrews (Eddie punched Wally for "seeing" Cindy--Wally was actually serving as a model for a sweater that Cindy was making for Eddie).

When I was a junior in high school I was on the softball team. We had a tournament that we were playing in in Moab, Utah (a good 4 hour drive from home), and because it was a weekend-long tourney, we were staying in a hotel there. It just so happened that said friend and another of our mutual friends had come to the tournament, as well. They weren’t playing, but friend #2′s brother was on the baseball team (and was a former flame of mine) and they had decided they wanted to see both of us play. So Friday night comes, we play in one of the qualifying games and then head back to the hotel for a little “free time.” Friend #1 (let’s call her Jen) and friend #2 (Kara, for this tale) show up at my hotel and ask if I will go hang out with them. I asked my coach and she said it was fine, so we took off in Jen’s piece of s#!t car. We drove down Main Street for a little while and then I realized that Jen and Kara were both drunk. I told them that I couldn’t get mixed up in whatever crap it was that they were doing and that they needed to take me back to my hotel. (I can honestly say that I was not drinking with them. Normally I might have, but softball was such an important thing to me in high school and I was working really hard for college, so I couldn’t allow myself to be pulled into anything that would jeopardize my future.) Just as I talked them into turning around, we see police beacons in the back window. Both of them panic. Kara begins weeping hysterically and Jen begins laughing maniacally. I am trying to get them both to calm down and shut up so that we don’t get arrested for DUI. (Although I was in the clear, the last thing I wanted was to be tagged as a delinquent.) In the midst of all the ballyhoo, Jen pulls over for the cop. But it wasn’t a normal “pull-to-the-side-of-the-road” pull over. Jen decides to turn left across Main Street and pulls into the exit to a Taco Bell drive-thru. With a cop tailing her, lights and sirens blaring.

Mix together the flour and semolina and create a mound on the counter top of your kitchen or table top with a crater in the center. Crack the eggs into the center of the flour and semolina. Use your fingers to gradually draw the dry ingredients into the center, mixing them with the eggs. The dough will be hard to mix at first but eventually it will come together and be relatively smooth.
