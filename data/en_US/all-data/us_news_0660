In the case of a war of choice waged primarily for humanitarian reasons, there are a number of rules that should guide American engagement, in our view. The provocation must be deemed severe enough to justify putting American lives at risk: Genocide, for example, shouldn't be allowed to continue just because its perpetrator invokes national sovereignty. Before an intervention begins, policymakers should determine that all the alternatives short of war have been exhausted. If the plan is to aid a rebel group, as in Libya or, potentially, Syria, planners should be sure of who those new allies are and what they stand for. Countries should seek the widest possible support before committing troops or resources; Obama was right to insist on the backing of the U.N. Security Council and the Arab League before taking action in Libya. Where possible, intervention should be undertaken by multilateral organizations rather than individual nations. Once war is underway, planners should set narrowly tailored, definable and achievable aims.

Decades ago, Baltimore County was divided into 15 election districts. They no longer have any real function in elections, but they remain the basis for apportionment of liquor licenses. In general, one "on-sale" license — that is, a bar or restaurant license — may be issued for every 2,500 people. Randallstown is the only part of the county that is undersubscribed when it comes to licenses, and because of grandfathering, one district, on the county's east side, is vastly oversubscribed. The Dundalk area, by population, should have about 42 licenses, but it actually has 125. Licenses can be bought and sold within a district (provided that the county liquor board approves of the new owner), but they cannot be sold across district lines without a special dispensation from the General Assembly, which controls county liquor laws.

Although the view is said to be spectacular from the slope of Concepción, whoever said so had the good fortune to climb on one of the few days when its top half wasn't shrouded in clouds. I recalled tales I had read of hikers perishing before the Nicaraguan tourism board mandated guide accompaniment in 2006. How could someone get lost on a volcano? I had thought. You just go down. But as the mist enveloped me so completely that I couldn't hear or see any of my companions, I started to understand.

Only Philadelphia's rotation has as many quality starts as the Cardinals' 14. And that has been Westbrook's point, both personal and pitching. What he lost got a lot of attention. What the Cardinals lost in Carpenter has garnered headlines.

Meanwhile, back at the plot. Nick and Monroe arrive at Melissa's spacious home (big white columns in front), but it's dark and eerie. "This is so the part of the horror movie where the sidekick gets it," says Monroe. Nick carries a flashlight in his best "X-Files" style (are the bees a reference to the first "X-Files" movie?) and eventually they discover a goopy hive upstairs. Clearly, Melissa is not your ordinary abandoned-mill owner.
"It was a classic pitchers' duel. It's the first time I ever threw 10 innings. It was neat," Lee told the Associated Press. "I'd rather give up two runs and get the win though. Any time you lose it's disappointing. I had a good change up and I was throwing my curveballs for strikes."

They face a real threat. Broadband speeds are now swift enough to permit Internet phone service from companies such as Vonage. Companies that create movies and TV shows can now deliver these via the Web. So the companies that dominate the broadband market face a new and direct threat to their core businesses. That gives them a motive to extract a toll for using the "fast lane" - or to keep competing companies like Vonage in the slow lane.

Party like it's 1979: Teresa decides it's time to throw a housewarming party -- not for the house she's being foreclosed on and not for the one she's being forced to sell off to settle millions and millions of debt. The other house. The one that's not for sale, even though the bankruptcy filing makes it seem like it's pretty much their own asset. That is, if they didn't owe so much on it. Let's take a moment to consider the timeline: Season two was shot in the fall of 2009. Teresa and husband Joe Giudice filed for bankruptcy in late October 2009. We don't know when the housewarming party was, but it apparently happened before Ashley's attack on Danielle at the North Jersey County Club on Nov. 11, which appears to be part of next week's episode. So, right around the time Teresa filed for bankruptcy, she hired party planner Elvira Grau, who envisioned a Studio 54 theme, and to that end rented furnishings, set up a dance floor, hired a chef, bartenders, cocktail waitresses dressed like Playboy bunnies, break dancers and fire-eaters (although did we actually see any fire being eaten?), stocked booze, etc. To be fair, it did look like Teresa scaled back her spending when it came to furnishing her own house. Her ginormous great room looked ridiculous with only two sofas, a coffee table and two gigantic urns in it. Then again, she did have a mirror the size of a Hummer in her bedroom.
Fusco-Walker added that patients who are used to CFC inhalers may have a slight learning curve in transitioning to HFA inhalers. "They need to be cleaned differently, and they have to be primed four times," she said. According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, HFA inhalers also taste different and have a less powerful puff of air.
Mitchell back: Starting defensive end Jayme Mitchell was back on the field Friday after missing Thursday's practice for a personal reason, and is expected to play Sunday. He sat out last week with chest and ankle injuries and was replaced by Emmanuel Stephens, who had four tackles. "He's back out here and he's doing great," said Shurmur of Mitchell.
"I know for me, that year we were all playing with each other it wasn't a one-man show," said Collison, Indiana's point guard who has missed four games because of a sore groin entering Monday's game against the Wolves. "We were playing team ball. When we got the opportunity and got our own thing in the NBA, we all just kind of branched out."
Just as Indy has slowly discovered this team, now the national audience will discover why they had the fifth-best record in the NBA. They will give the Heat -- we're assuming the Heat -- all they can handle.
The Mark Twain Commemorative Coin Act would require that a surcharge from the sale of $1 and $5 commemorative coin sales be divided between the Mark Twain House and Museum in Hartford, Conn.; the Mark Twain Papers and Project at the Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley; the Center for Mark Twain Studies at Elmira College in New York; and the Mark Twain Boyhood Home and Museum in Hannibal, Mo.
Mohamed, a senior at the University of St. Thomas, said he had expected the event, inspired by a venerable Spanish event called La Tomatina, to lure mostly people from his age bracket. Instead, 30 percent of the crowd was over 35 and 40 percent from 25 to 35. They came dressed up in all-white, painter's coveralls and other "crazy costumes," including a coterie of pirates.

So, I get the need for manners, and I appreciate Debbie's reminder. I also don't want to turn into one of those people who bray that they just get too many invitations to keep up. That's like complaining you've got too many friends. Trying whining about that a few times and you'll have free time faster than you can order takeout for one.

On Wednesday, the Justice Department sent a letter to Judge Guimond saying its lawyers had carefully reviewed the documents before they were put on the Web. "Regrettably, a number of R.W.

Beck through its counsel, we also apologize to the court."
Nov. 18 — Ford 400, Homestead, Fla.
Shurmur: "He's extremely fast. I think he talked about running a 4.26 at some point. We got him clocked down there around 4.3. He can beat anybody in here. He can go, he can really go. We got some intimate knowledge of him. Mark Whipple was with him in Miami. He talked about how this guy has got a great future. He hasn't really been exposed to the kind of coaching he's going to get in this league. He felt like this was a tremendous kid. Now, we got to know him and he is a hard guy not to like. I can't wait for you to get to meet him. You're going to feel the same way about him that you did about meeting Brandon and of course Trent. There is a lot there. He is extremely fast and when you put speed on the field it changes things just like when you put a running back that could really go. We felt like he was going to add that element to our receiving corps."

“People of New Jersey need to decide,” Christie said last week during a State House news conference. “Do they want to know for sure that their property taxes will increase no more than 2.5 percent a year or do they want to continue to engage in the game of Trenton roulette, where the amount of increase depends on which slot the ball falls in, which special interest is going to be catered to, which tax is going to be increased that year.
Reports surfaced this weekend as Boston hustled to craft an extension with Gonzalez that the Gold Glove winner wanted a Ryan Howard-type deal.

Perry said he was cognizant of when he first arrived in Corvallis of not walking into a meeting with the secondary and instantly declaring himself an expert. In fact, he says he’s noticed that players tend to listen more when you first ask them what they think about everything.

A: Last time I checked, the NBA does not issue get-out-of-Knicks-series cards. The real question should be: How could a team with as much talent as the Knicks have allowed themselves to toil until season's end at the bottom of the playoff seedings? My only issue with Heat-Knicks is how they keep Knicks fans out of AmericanAirlines Arena. To have Spike Lee clowning the Heat from the front row directly across the Heat bench is just wrong. Happiness would be seeing Spike along the rail, among the standing-room-only, atop the balcony seats. If only.

I don't think I'd be very successful at my job if I didn't feel that way. I mean, c'mon? That's not really too tough of a question. That doesn't mean that things are going to work out that way.

During those fallow periods, it must have been tempting for the musicians to chase trends. The Smithereens were better positioned to capitalize on grunge's popularity than other college rock bands because they already rocked hard. They barely budged. The Smithereens did toughen their sound and turn up the amps during the dark days of the early '90s, but they never misplaced their core sound: a little wild Who, some Lennon at his darkest, some Costello wit and urgency, and Jersey hard rock crunch. This was all filtered through Pat DiNizio's vision: the songwriter's narrators are, like the protagonists of the classic films he loves, drowning in obsessive emotion. For DiNizio, love is peril. The character in "Behind the Wall of Sleep" would gladly lose his soul for the woman he's smitten with. In "A Girl Like You," the band's most popular song, a man prepares to give up everything, say anything, and abandon his identity for a shot at satisfying his desire. "In a world of pain, I have no peer," he sings in "Only a Memory," as he searches the house for a woman who left him.

As we continue to digest all of the legislation that passed in the final hours of the session a few things remain clear with the dysfunction in Annapolis. It is now clearer than ever that Annapolis is moving ahead with plans to run Maryland counties from the state capital. The budget continues to exhibit the characteristics that the State of Maryland does not have a revenue problem but has a spending problem. I continue to resist efforts to raise the personal income tax, gas tax and any efforts to reduce mortgage interest deductions. As the economy barely begins to recover, I think it's the worst time to impose additional tax and fee burdens on working families in Harford County.

"The Collected Works of Billy the Kid" was first published by a small press in the 1970s when its author, Michael Ondaatje, was still in his 20s and two decades away from the success and fame that would arrive with "The English Patient."

The last few games are important on several levels.

True, right? Actually, no. It's true that there were good intentions to improve the fire and safety codes.

That's what I'm doing and I'm loving it. There's nothing more I can ask for."

Chase Utley, Phillies: His chronic knee problems leave fans wondering how much and how well he will play for the rest of his contract, which pays him $15.3 million this season and $15.3 million next year.

It certainly helps that, while MSU doesn't always have a great team, the Spartans pretty much always have a veteran team. MSU does not churn out first-round picks like Kansas and North Carolina. Players rarely leave early. So when it is their turn to lead, they are ready. Draymond Green is the most recent and extreme example of this, but many Spartans have become tougher, mentally and physically, as upperclassmen.

Part of the problem is the fact that more Americans (especially youth, service members and those hit hardest by a poor economy) have become more transient: nearly 1 in 8 Americans moved between 2008 and 2010, Pew reported.

The group put down $1.3 million for television ads in Alabama, another $900,000 in Mississippi and more for radio on Christian and other radio stations as well as thousands of pieces of mail designed to help the former Massachusetts governor.
