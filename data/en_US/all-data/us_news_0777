Housing starts are still hovering near 30-year lows."

Just outside Krotz Springs, 23-year-old Jake Nolan said National Guard troops knocked on the door of his home in a subdivision to tell his mother of the evacuation order. He said they advised her to have white towels and have access to the roof if they planned to ride it out -- presumably in case of a rescue -- though that didn't appear to be part of any official instructions. And besides, he didn't need an order to leave with his wife and three children.
A major reason for this fundamental disconnect between buyers (employers) and sellers (candidates) is that organizations often correlate past experience with future success. Without possessing a clear understanding of what really drives success, many employers mistakenly focus on whether a candidate has done something before.

Carter is accused of keeping the assistant in "involuntary servitude," making her work for 24 hours at a time without any monetary compensation, giving her bizarre commands such as to sit in a bathtub for hours, eat pizza after having a cat sit on it, call Carter "Dom," short for "Dominator" -- and telling her he would kill her if she didn't do exactly what he said.
At the same time, the practice is hard to stop, say websites and federal officials. Sites try to catch underage users - "We are not burying our head in the sand," said Joe Sullivan, the chief security officer at Facebook - but verifying a young person's age over the Internet is a task that ranges from tricky to near-impossible.

Then, fate presented a chance for a rematch for a man who hates losing more than anything.

A different, happier Gray Maynard came back to Vegas, knowing what he had to do.

This was a more diverse, informal crowd, heavy on the twentysomethings but ranging way up in age, with jeans, T-shirts and sweaters and tie-less shirts mixed in among the suits.

Yew's arrival in Chicago from New York is not, of course, the only big change at Victory Gardens in recent years. The theater's move to the newly renovated Biograph Theater was similarly transformational: the larger mainstage offered more opportunity to do bigger plays but demanded more sophisticated production values. And the move to the Biograph also left the theater — and now Yew — with an ongoing budget deficit. The audience did not grow with the size of the new theater. Rarely has the Biograph mainstage been sold out.

Mechanization brought by the Industrial Revolution, which flowered in the 19th century, created an era of conspicuous consumption. Suddenly, residents of Alameda could buy goods their parents couldn't. They displayed this triumph ornately: in the bay windows, tall ceilings, swirling woodwork and gingerbread trim.
But the benchmark has shifted during the intervening 14 years. Seafood selection and preparation has improved exponentially in restaurants all over town. Meanwhile, the Oceanaire's innovative edge seems to have dulled. Parasole spun it off in 2001 and the company expanded across the country until it slammed head-on into the Great Recession. Next stop: Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In 2010, the company was purchased by deep-pocketed Landry's Restaurants Inc., a Texas-based conglomerate behind a number of chains, including the Rainforest Cafe.

"When I first moved here, the one daily Piedmont rarely filled one coach; now there are six full trains," said the former Ohioan, joking that weekend trains are called "laundry runs" because so many college students use them to visit home on weekends.

As someone who covered Oregon State the past few seasons, I'm still getting used to the idea of closed practices. But I'm curious what the fans think about closed vs. open practices. And please, put aside your media hatred while in the comments section and just answer this -- Do coaches in this day and age, specifically Chip Kelly, have something to fear by opening practices? In the last decade, fans have become accustomed to being able to watch practice whenever they please, save for Civil War week -- does it bother you that the rules are changing, even a little bit? I have a few friends who are big Duck fans, and one commented to me last season that he didn't like how things were changing; he said he felt like Oregon was become a less and less friendly program, and having grown up in the state, he wasn't used to that. But I'm curious to know what other fans out there think ...

øUntil recent days, Joe Paterno was among the most revered citizens in Pennsylvania. Critics suggest his larger-than-life legend contributed to an atmosphere in which his program could seem to function above the law.

The farm-to-table movement, adopted by pioneering Portland chefs in the early 1990s, has been around long enough to become a well-worn cliche and the butt of jokes. But, spurred by forward-thinking farmers and pesky diners, produce from Oregon and southwest Washington has leapt off the white linen tablecloth and into neighborhood sports bars, Northwest chains and tiny family-run eateries. Today, a crop of new chefs, along with purveyors of those chains, pubs and cafes, have joined Portland's farm-to-table pioneers in bringing the concept to the masses. That's not only been good for diners who want to know where their food comes from, but it's also drawn national attention to Oregon's dining scene, and created a new market for rural farmers, even in an economic downturn.

To this point Paul maintained the crowd's interest. But then he turned to the seemingly ridiculous: the assurance of salvation Jesus gave to all by his resurrection from the dead. It was at this point, the story in Acts notes, that some "scoffed", or according to other translations of the Greek verb echleuason, "jeered," or "mocked" him. A notable few, including a man named Dionysius and a woman named Damaris, continued to follow Paul and became Christians.

After M's abortion, I started to clip anti-abortion messages and put them in her locker. I joined the debate team that was debating Roe v. Wade and became a right-winged activist.

It became about me, my emotion and my family (much like it is for most adolescents), and I was relentless.
Last week, the Obama campaign ran a cheap-shot ad on the death of Osama bin Laden. Part of the ad was Bill Clinton effectively talking about the decision to kill the terrorist. But, in the middle, the Obama people threw in a low-minded attack on Romney. The slam made Clinton look small, it made Obama look small, it turned a moment of genuine accomplishment into a political ploy, but it did follow the rules of gangland: At every second, attack; at every opportunity, drive a shiv between the ribs.

Mullen says that sums up the way she intends to lead the 104-year-old college -- by working with its strengths, and embracing its identity and legacy. And changing perceptions.

Mullen wants the public to realize the college is central to Oregon's identity and that it's preparing students for a complex world where the craft of manually making something is invaluable.

Sam and Dan? My picks from the beginning, but they've (both of them) become too whiny, and the brother-squabbling is over the top.

Newsom told CNN that gays deserved "the same kind of rights that are extended to my relationship with my wife" -- whom, Californians later learned, he cheated on with his friend's wife. I find it interesting that the four most prominent heterosexual politicians supporting a new definition of marriage -- Newsom, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer and his successor, David Paterson -- have all acknowledged committing adultery, in the latter two cases with numerous women. Shouldn't that disqualify them from deciding what marriage should be?

That young Joe somehow managed to survive the traumatic ordeal isn’t exactly to say that he has lived to tell about it. For the rest of his life, Joe has been sadly resigned to burying it deep within himself and letting his inner demons eat away at him.

The recent availability of a blood test is helpful in identifying people treated with Tysabri who are at risk for developing PML and may aid treatment decisions.

Teague's last school didn't have football, and his new school has a BCS program in need of a jump-start.

New Jersey is already awaiting word from a federal judge about whether it will have to return $50 million it received for providing speech and physical therapy as well as psychological counseling to disabled students.
By proposing his amendment, McGovern helpfully illuminates the lengths to which some liberals want to go. So when next you hear histrionic warnings about tea party or other conservative "extremism," try to think of (BEG ITAL)anything(END ITAL) on the right comparable to McGovern's proposed vandalism of the Bill of Rights.

seek a solution.
Zach (David Elder), director/choreographer of the new show, is a demanding, or possibly sadistic, guy. Besides making the prospective chorus members dance, he insists that they tell personal stories in front of everyone. (Such stories were, in fact, the root of this Pulitzer Prize-winning musical. But those dancers revealed themselves at two marathon rap sessions, not an audition.) These stories, the heart of the show, emerge in spoken language, song and, of course, dance; they make us care about the grown "boys" and "girls" putting everything on the line.

Improvised Jazz Solo: "500 Miles High," Chick Corea
Modern civilization can be compared to that of the Iron Age non-civilization that existed in western Turkey thousands of years ago? Wrong. The plunderers of ancient Lydia now go by a different moniker--politicians--and their methods are much more devious than a stone to the head. (Example: "We're going to spend a trillion taxpayer dollars on "shovel-ready" jobs to keep unemployment under 8% while creating and (what we will hilariously call) "saving" millions of jobs." And two years later, "That first tril worked so well, we want to spend another half-tril on the same crap we told you the first tril was for.")
Senior outfielder Derek Mattea (Collinsville) figures to be one of the key contributors for the Missouri State baseball team that is the pick to win the Missouri Valley Conference title. The Bears, 33-23 overall and 11-9 in the MVC a year ago, were No. 1 in the league's preseason coaches poll.
The answer, a resounding yes, is something of a foregone conclusion. It is not any given topic that is literary, but the writer, no matter gender or whether she (or he) has children. And here, Enright proves herself to be one of Ireland's most strikingly accessible literary talents.

Axis forces fought with fanatical ferocity. In Europe, Luftwaffe and Panzer regiments mowed down Allied forces with ruthless efficiency. V-1 buzz bombs and V-2 rockets rained terror on England. German engineers fielded revolutionary jet-powered aircraft that easily screamed past any airplane under Allied command. The Third Reich's brilliant scientists raced against Allied efforts to create a revolutionary explosive based on splitting atoms.

It goes almost without saying that the claims against me implied in Current's statement are untrue and will be proved so in the legal actions I will be filing against them presently. To understand Mr. Hyatt's "values of respect, openness, collegiality and loyalty," I encourage you to read of a previous occasion Mr. Hyatt found himself in court for having unjustly fired an employee.

Siegel left more than a year ago to head to the Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton San Francisco.
The Sun's typical and relentless bias against the GOP and conservatives in general was certainly on display in your editorial "Buying the presidency" (Feb. 24). One could just as easily substitute "super Unions" for "super PACs" and get the same results. It should be noted that those contributing money to the super PACs give their funds voluntarily to support candidates or causes, while contributions by the unions are taken from union members who do not necessarily want their dues going to the unions' choices of candidates or causes. Let's have a little fairness and probity here.
Of course, in heavily partisan districts, the divisive primary effect is irrelevant. The seven-way Republican primary battle to replace retiring 15-term Rep. Dan Burton is so heated because it will determine the general election winner. Democrats don't stand a chance in the 5th District.
You have a natural compass on Gozo, for in every direction one sees a church dome, partitioned and its recesses painted red, resembling a Catholic cardinal's skullcap. From most points, you see the shimmering Mediterranean, or the pinnacles and ramparts of Victoria's noble fortress, Il-Kastell.

Follow-up question: Does Teresa Giudice know what "impugn" means? We've been waiting for the inevitable Teresa-Caroline Manzo showdown since the end of season two, when cracks in the "We're all one big happy family" facade started to show during the "Real Housewives of New Jersey" pilgrimage to Italy. And throughout the third season, Caroline's patience is clearly wearing thin, between the bikini fashion shows and the shotgun parties and the Teresa's inability to follow her sage advice. But we are a teeny bit surprised that it's apparently going to come to a head over a lighthearted passage in Teresa's latest cookbook, "Fabulicous: Teresa's Italian Family Cookbook."
And from that guilt, Springsteen says, came a feeling of responsibility to tell the stories of the people who never got that big advance, who never got the chance to slam the screen door on that life and get away from the house with the cabbage-rose wallpaper and bills on the kitchen table.

"I’ve never had a massage in my life," he says.
Durchik concedes that vaccinations can be costly, though the Health District's partnership with the Ohio Department of Health helps to keep costs in check. In addition, Durchik argues that costs associated with non-immunization would be far higher.

"I am thankful to the very kind Interstate Towing driver who helped strap my bumper back on my van this Sunday after it was damaged in an accident.

You both made an awful situation bearable. "

Who: Bob Fay, CPA, explains federal tax issues for small businesses, and Ohio Department of Taxation representatives will speak about CAT, sales and income tax obligations for the state.
A. Yes, I thought it was odd at first. I quickly learned that ADCers don’t follow the typical business rhetoric just to say we do. We take the best principles and adapt them to fit us, not the other way around. We also have unusual team names that say what the team does: Product Availability (purchasing), Focused Image (marketing), Logistics (warehouse).
Kudos to the builder and decorator. It looks and feels like an upscale French country restaurant nestled on a good piece of land in Roseville. Nice details, especially the high ceilings and exposed wood beams. Lovely patio, appealing fireplace.
The Romney campaign is aggressively looking into all aspects of the Obama administration, with a plan to present the president as a nice and likable but unsuited to solving the country's economic challenges.

His home near the 18th hole of a country club was in jeopardy. Property records show he had refinanced the mortgage at least three times in five years and owed close to $1.7 million on a property now assessed at $1.08 million.

The Volt's electric motor produces a relatively mild 148 horsepower, but the 3,781-pound car accelerated confidently on metro Detroit surface roads and highways. That's because electric motors generate their maximum torque -- the force that most directly affects acceleration -- as soon as you depress the accelerator. The Volt's motor generates a healthy 273 pound-feet of torque, more than some big V6 engines.

McMullen received a bachelor's degree in economics from Pomona College and a master's degree in public economics from the University of Pennsylvania.
Each of the last few years, a bill has been filed to limit the free meals, if not outlaw them altogether. Limitations on such giveways are the norm in state legislatures around the country. Not in Missouri. Here, lawmakers seem downright indignant when it is suggested they should have to buy their own meals.
Amgen was founded as Applied Molecular Genetics in 1980 with funding from venture capitalists amid a rush to exploit the power of gene splicing. The company worked on several products in its early years, including cloned chicken growth hormone, meant to increase broiler production.

Capriles represents a new style of political opponent in a country where old parties are largely viewed as corrupt. He defeated the president's handpicked candidate in his run for governor by emphasizing education and pledging to represent rich and poor alike.

He's launched anti-hunger projects, and called for the private and public sectors to work together to raise living standards for everyone.

I thought about this last week as I was driving down the King Kamehameha Highway on Oahu after sunset. As I approached the small town of La'ie, I noticed a bright glow in the darkness off to the right. When I got close enough, I could see where the light was coming from: the illuminated Mormon temple. It was like finding the Lincoln Memorial in the middle of a jungle; that is how out of context it seemed.

We are about to have the worst presidential campaign money can buy.

“(I) didn’t have a fastball,” Hunter said. “You get hit when you don’t have one. That’s just the bottom line. I’ve got a couple bullpens coming up and the emphasis is going to be down in the zone.

No matter your background, at some point you've probably braved the omnipresent lines on the Magnificent Mile for a bag of hot caramel or buttery popcorn at Garrett's. Bread and Wine's salted caramel popcorn panna cotta is an incredible custard expression of this ubiquitous Chicago tradition, so much so that our table orders a second helping while fighting over the last drops of the first portion. Panna cotta is usually too jiggly and bulked up on gelatin. Bread & Wine's is creamy, reminiscent of an indulgent creme brulee.

In Congress, Wisconsin's Sensenbrenner isn't the only legislator with an E15 bill. A bipartisan Senate bill backed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., would limit liability of retailers and others for problems caused by E15, including damage to car engines.

Rick Santorum may be out of the GOP presidential race, but Democratic strategist and talking-head Hilary Rosen has given him a consolation prize. Rosen's now-notorious crack that Ann Romney has "never worked a day in her life" offers seeming vindication for Santorum's argument that liberals and feminists are engaged in a misogynistic crusade to make working outside the home the only marker of social value and self-respect.

But the world cannot afford to ignore a humanitarian crisis of the magnitude now facing Somalia, where the continuing flood of refugees threatens not only to destabilize neighboring countries but also strengthen the hand of Islamist extremists bent on exploiting the chaos.

We are the only country that can really make a difference at this point, and we should use the opportunity to do whatever we can to help those most in need.

Where the sun's magnetic field becomes tangled, cooler sunspots result, some a mere 5,000 degrees. Those sunspots are draped by strong magnetic fields that spit out solar storms, outbursts of charged particles and radiation shot into space.
