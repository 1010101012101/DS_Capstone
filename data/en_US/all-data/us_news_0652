The larger point I’d like to offer in response to those who either think more needs to be made of Garcetti’s achievements or to those who think I’m already in his camp is that my columns on the mayor’s race for the moment are in the nature of scene-setting. I’m trying to introduce the personalities of those who will contend for the seat, which is up in 2013. This isn’t the time to examine each candidate’s record in detail but rather to say who’s a serious candidate and why -- and a little bit about who they are. As the campaign unwinds, I’ll look more deeply at each and at their records.
Pairing France's highest-of-high-brow museums with a Japanese technology company behind games like Donkey Kong, Mario Brothers and Zelda might not seem like a natural fit.

In Darkness is also, pivotally, the story of a city sewer worker, Leopold Socha (Robert Wieckiewicz). A married man, a Gentile, whose moral core seems fairly coreless at first, Socha takes money to harbor the Jews - guiding them to hideouts, bringing food and supplies. It was a mercernary act, not a missionary one, but over the course of the year and two months that he served as their secret guardian, Socha undergoes his own transformation. Like many of his Polish brethren, he felt antipathy toward the folks with the stars sewn on their clothes, living in the ghetto. But as he comes to know them, playing with the children and befriending Mundek (Benno Fürmann), a brawny thug who insists on returning aboveground to look for a missing girl, Socha puts himself at risk, sacrificing his own safety and standing in the community to help the frightened fugitives.

But the “Four Last Songs” offer a more formidable challenge, for their subject is human frailty, the exact reverse of what is demanded from the soloist. They are expressions of gratitude for a long life (the composer was in his mid-80s when he set to work) and a fulfilled, comfortable resignation toward impending death. They should be sung in the spirit of a last leaf on a sun-splashed autumn day; there is no more fully adult, meticulously planned and ecstatically fashioned leave-taking in the repertory.

Hussein did, indeed, bar inspectors after Clinton-era 1998 raids on suspected remnant Iraqi weapons facilities. But Hussein caved to U.N. Security Council demands in the fall of 2002, and U.N. inspectors were active in Iraq for three months — before being pulled for their safety just prior to late March of 2003 U.S.-led military action.

It was this radical, overarching vision that enabled him to hold together a movement that constantly seemed on the verge of fracturing over strategy and tactics or collapsing under the onslaught of those who would use any means to defend the old order. In doing so, he inspired not only his fellow Americans but people throughout the world to stand up for their basic human rights and dignity. The revolution he spearheaded may still be unfinished, but its repercussions have resounded around the globe from Northern Ireland to South Africa, from Tiananmen Square to the Arab Spring.

That's a good question. I guess if I really dig a song and I think the Cats can make it our own without corrupting the original version, I bring it in to the band.

MF: No, that's not right. The self-interest of the kind of people you just described is promoting public policy. That's what they're interested in doing. For example, what was my self-interest in economics? My self-interest to begin with was to understand the real mystery and puzzle that was the Great Depression. My self-interest was to try to understand why that happened, and that's what I enjoyed doing – that was my self-interest. Out of that I grew to learn some things – to have some knowledge. Following that, my self-interest was to see that other people understood the same things and took appropriate action.
Manning's presence does put a win-now flavor to the Broncos, but his abilities are such — Elway has said all boats rise with him — that the Broncos could still remain true to a foundation built in the draft.

The daughter of a Methodist minister and a piano-playing teacher, Ryder sang in her father's churches, in student choirs at Parkway West High School and in the St. Louis Symphony Chorus; she's currently an alto in the choir of St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Ladue.

Except he is, in a way. He has the gift of serenity, in this sense: The oldest of four siblings, he has seen two brothers and a sister surpass him in size, and acquire cars and college educations. He, however, with an underdeveloped entitlement mentality, has been equable about life's sometimes careless allocation of equity. Perhaps this is partly because, given the nature of Down syndrome, neither he nor his parents have any tormenting sense of what might have been. Down syndrome did not alter the trajectory of his life; Jon was Jon from conception on.

She and her brother and sister return here a couple of times a year — in fact, her brother calls during our meal to check up on his take-out order — to soak up the atmosphere. “It never changes,” she says admiringly.

Marston, who co-wrote the script with Andamion Murataj, focuses much of his attention on just how isolating and endless that sort of house arrest can feel.

The claustrophobia of confinement and Nik's growing frustration are there in the ball endlessly bounced against the living room wall, or the drawing scratched on another next to his bed.

Kipps instead ventures out to Eel Marsh House, the crumbling pile where the dead woman lived. A causeway that floods during high tide leaves it isolated. The disturbing d�cor suggests an 1800s Tim Burton as interior decorator; the delightfully demented wind-up toys are a brilliant touch. Once Kipps is inside -- naturally circumstances conspire to force an overnight stay -- it's pretty standard haunted-house movie stuff.

In an eerie quirk of fate, an inferno of even greater proportions was visited upon a village 250 miles to the north that same evening.

You couldn't not be touched by these kids."

The offense continued to struggle for long stretches, and Purdue's aggressive defense took advantage by creating one layup after another to run the Illini out of Mackey Arena. The Boilermakers (12-3, 2-0) have won the last seven meetings, and coach Matt Painter is 9-4 against Weber.
It’s all pretty dramatic and deliberately offensive, in a punk-rock kind of way. The problem, though, is that the Runaways themselves weren’t really that dramatic and offensive — or even influential.

Our endorsements offer just one guidepost against which to measure candidates. Readers know what our values are and where we stand on issues, and they can use those markers, combined with our picks, to learn more about where candidates stand. All newspaper editors would like to think their endorsements sway voters in a positive direction; it wouldn't surprise -- or even disappoint -- me if just as many people saw our endorsements as advice to vote for the other candidate.

Steve and Jabu's marriage, with so much that binds them and much that threatens to tear them apart, is at the heart of the novel. Here Gordimer is on familiar territory and her insights into the complexity of such a union are subtle and insightful on many levels. But the couple has no sea of tranquillity to swim in — it is full of shifting currents and cultural whirlpools. Jabu's Zulu roots and, still more, Steve's attraction to the siren song of all that the wider world has to offer signal danger for them. The novel's denouement is stunning in its abruptness but more powerful precisely for that reason. Her protagonist's final declaration mirrors Gordimer's own unconditional embrace of the here and now in her native land, no matter how challenging it is.
Simply repairing the burned half of the existing 85-year-old school would not create enough classroom space, would leave the school with outdated electrical and safety systems and with a gym that is less than half the recommended size, DLR said.

Emaus, 26, played just 14 games with the Mets in 2011 before being returned to Toronto. He batted just .162 during that stretch. He was originally a Rule 5 draft pick.

But consider the issues surrounding the district, including widespread poor student performance, not to mention fights and assaults, even the sexual assault of a teacher.

"Public Enemies" wasn't a great movie, but "Hoosiers" (1986), which is about Hoosiers and was filmed largely in Indianapolis, may be the best sports movie ever made.

Even if you won't admit it, the Supreme Court has. In 1943, it unambiguously stated that "if there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in ... religion, or other matters of opinion." The court didn't say "except when pastors address the subject of electoral candidates." I side with the Supreme Court on this one.
Following the exit of "mean judge" Simon Cowell at the end of Season 9, the "Idol" judges have focused on being nice to contestants, with trenchant criticism the exclusive province of 59-year-old mentor and record mogul Jimmy Iovine, who appears in taped segments.

Dimora and former County Auditor Frank Russo often stole the spotlight at past annual dinners with their banter, self-deprecating humor and focus on honoring elected officials. The two have left politics after being charged in the massive federal public corruption investigation into the Democratic-controlled county government. Dimora has been charged with 26-corruption-related counts and pleaded not guilty. Russo was charged with 21 counts and accepted a plea agreement last September.

Among all the expert recommendations put forth, the researchers could find only one case for which the expert guidelines were rooted in medical evidence of a need for a particular amount of sleep. That was a 1926 study that measured the actual sleep of 500 kids between the ages of 6 and 15 who were deemed “healthy.” Other than that, it seems that experts simply looked at the amount of sleep children around them were getting and figured that they really needed a little bit more, the authors wrote.

That they are quite mortal, even on offense, away from home. The Titans have had a solid season, but the Saints were lucky to get on a plane back to New Orleans with a victory. They improved to 4-3 on the road, thanks at least in part to the inexperience of Jake Locker at the end of the game. The Saints got help in the homefield battle with the 49ers losing, but a trip to Green Bay (where they’ve already lost this season) likely looms.

Anyone who cherishes the 1950s or at least enjoys the kitsch from that time, will get a kick out of the Flamingo Conference Resort & Spa. This Santa Rosa historic landmark, which has a spinning pink flamingo on its roof and Charlie Brown statues in its lobby, was built in 1957. Fashioned after the famous Las Vegas Flamingo, this once-glamorous resort hotel immediately drew Hollywood stars of the day, including Jayne Mansfield who spent hours by the Olympic-sized pool.

I think the gravity of that matchup may be understood, but just as important may be how the other forwards in this series produce. Shawn Marion and Gerald Wallace are both very important to their teams' success, and skilled on both sides of the ball.

It probably doesn't change a lot of what I do. I don't think it would affect what restaurant we go to, if we were going to a movie or something, I don't think it really hits that intrinsically. If somebody was of a faith that they didn't drink alcohol, it probably might be a little bit of a limitation. If you want to have wine with dinner, it puts a bummer on that.

Check guidebooks and consult with local tourist offices and hotel staff for advice on what to watch out for. Take special care after dark, in dense crowds, and with likable strangers. The freedom of being far from home can release inhibitions in wonderful ways. In fact, I try to do something new every trip.

"Like any new industry or trend, as soon as everyone jumps in, the regulations follow, which often makes sense.

"The only way I can connect the dots is with racino," Senjem said of the stadium funding puzzle. "We had it towards the end of the session, and it seemed to have some traction."
Personal story: "In our 2011 season, my volleyball team became the Class 2 state champions. Going into Districts, we had to beat our biggest cross-town rival: Crystal City. In sectionals, we had to defeat a team we had previously lost to in a tournament,Scott City, and to advance to the Final Four, we played the exact same school that stood between us and state in 2010: Bloomfield. I was fortunate enough to be a member of the 2010 team that got second in state and a captain of the team that got first in state in 2011. While competing in the championship match, I was able to come off the bench and actually score some points after a teammate had been injured in the first day of play. Because I always worked hard and supported my team, I was there to fill in when a starter got hurt. Although terrifying, playing the championship match against Fatima was one of the most exciting things of my life. Through my entire high school career, I have learned that attitude and dedication are everything, because at the end of the day, it is just as easy to support my team on the court as it is on the bench."
"I think doubles is the biggest transition," Brozovich said of the changes. "With the doubles you're switching partners and you don't know what the team dynamic is going to be. You have to figure out who you're going to pair up with. In singles there's only one person on the court."

Such moves give the firms, which don't have the clout of major studios like Warner Bros. and Paramount Pictures, better access to the lucrative Chinese market. The deals also offer filmmakers access to a potentially huge source of capital: Chinese investors, who face significant restrictions on sending their money overseas. However, partnerships in China also mean U.S. producers must work closely with the country's Communist government and its censors.
Rekowski said he was "very pleased, quite pleased" with Friday's rulings.
Glenn Stark laid white roses outside the Apple store in London's Covent Garden. "I had to remember him," said 23-year-old Mr. Stark, an employee at an Apple reseller who was on holiday from Switzerland.

Still, when time is of the essence, people worry that a cellphone might not be charged, the call might get dropped or that they might not even be able to find it. As with TV remotes, a cellphone never seems to be in the same place twice.

DICK SUMMERS: I didn't get married until I was 32, so I thought there were a lot of places to go and a lot of things to do. I used to go to the Plaza and Westport in my 20s. Getting back out when I got divorced, I went to Village Singles, which I found so large it was difficult getting into it. I'm a small-group kind of a person. I play golf, and I heard in 2000, on my way home one night, that there was a singles golf club getting started. ... I'm just finishing up the year being president.

Yet, if you add all the ingredients in the prepared products, including the anchovies, tamarind and molasses in the Worcestershire sauce, the spices and corn syrup in the ketchup and vinegar and chiles in the hot sauce, you probably end up with more than 25 ingredients.

From 2004 to 2006, Inge was an average major league hitter and above-average third baseman. After that he was sometimes decent, sometimes almost-decent and often injured. He had a normal career for a player of his caliber: rough start, pretty good peak in his late 20s, then a decline. The difference with Inge is that he did it all in one city. Almost all players of his ability play for several teams. They aren't loved or hated. They are just there, and then way over there, and then out there.
In Game 2, the Jaguars kept the heat on the Vikings. They sprinted to a 13-5 lead helped by a string of solid serves from Josh Thomas and some impressive blocks, particularly from Nate Richardson.

But the budding romance is doomed: Goethe, whose literary aspirations have been dampened by rounds of rejection letters, has taken a job clerking for a fussy judge (Moritz Bleibtreu). This man, Kestner, is a bachelor. He is well-off. And he sets his sights on Lotte, unaware that she is already involved with his upstart clerk. (Nor does Goethe know the object of Kestner's affections.) Soon, he is proposing marriage, and Lotte, torn between her ardor for Goethe and her sense of duty - Kestner could provide for her impoverished family - wells up with angst and anguish.

That dollop of leftist populism would have added a few paragraphs to the federal tax code -- but after 72,000 pages, who's counting anymore? -- and given tax consultants to the wealthy a 15-minute puzzle to solve.

This is a highly literate drama (Hampton wrote the screenplay) with a distinguished cast that includes Michael Fassbender as Jung, Viggo Mortensen as Freud and Keira Knightley as Spielrein. Cronenberg, not known for making decorous films for tea-sipping academics, plunges us immediately into the grotesqueries of Spielrein's hysteria. Unfortunately, this sort of mental distress is difficult to capture on camera. Spielrein's symptoms are flamboyantly theatrical, yet Knightley's portrayal of them seems like a calculated performance. She grunts and stammers and flails in a manner that doesn't so much invoke someone in the throes of mental illness as an actor laying it out there for award season.

The script: In the middle, Unga played OK, but not spectacularly, and Robinson might actually be better on the outside. A throwback OSU middle linebacker who cleans up all over the field (and makes a ton of tackles) would transform this group because potentially Welch and Doctor could be outstanding. They have the kind of speed and hitting ability Beavers’ outside linebackers had in the good old days. Welch could turn into a special player. Fans saw glimpses of what he could do last season. … the experience factor: Robinson started four games in 2011 at three different LB positions, Unga started eight games at MLB, and Doctor started 11 games at weakside LB.

Today, the town is a popular tourist destination and jumping-off point for attractions in the vicinity.

His assessment is backed up by numbers from the New York Building Congress, a trade association for the construction industry. In a report issued this week, the group forecast that construction spending in the city will rise 5 percent this year after dropping 3.5 percent in 2011.

A: While I was preparing for the marathon, I was regularly eating jerky. What I found was that there was little innovation in the jerky market.

"All three tales revolve around conflicts between love and vocation; more significant, all explore tensions between desire and gratification. Even when dreams are fulfilled, when love and vocation are balanced...such harmony is short-lived. Smith's characters are no more able than we are to reach a permanent resolution of desire, nor do they, any more than we, really want such a resolution -- the craving for challenging adventure is as strong as the need for peaceful security."
Kennedy's role on Sunday was to underscore Kucinich's message.

NEW YORK (USA TODAY) — The seventh-season auditions were winding down last month with a final stop here, and if it weren't already apparent, this year's America's Got Talent, NBC's vaudeville talent carnival returning Monday (8 ET/PT), is all about Howard.
Being the biggest rapper in the U.K. is a nice honor, but to be fair, it’s not as reliable a predictor of stateside sales as being the biggest rapper in certain New York neighborhoods. So why is Tinie Tempah — the current king of U.K. hip-hop — succeeding where so many other heralded British emcees have not? It’s partially because he’s adopted American production styles, and he wears them as well as our current batch of homegrown hitmaking emcees do. Bombastic Top 20 hit “Written in the Stars” sounds like it could have been peeled from a B.o.B set list; “So Addicted” enlists the synth-happy help of Drake compatriot Boi-1da; “Love Suicide” adopts the laid-back acoustic-rap style that Wiz Khalifa put to questionable use on “Rolling Papers.” But it’s also because American hip-hop production has moved closer to the old continent. A club track like “Miami 2 Ibiza,” which co-stars the Swedish House Mafia, would have felt alien six years ago; in 2011, its house-rap groove feels awfully familiar. As for the emcee himself, he’s hit-or-miss, but an endearing innocence sweetens his braggadocio. “When I was a kid,” he raps on “Illusion,” “I wished that I could be in Narnia.” Me, too, Tinie.

Symbolizing the closure of that divide was the seating arrangement in the sun-drenched Rose Garden, with California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, representing a state in the vanguard of the environmental movement, next to Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, representing the heart of the belleaguered auto industry. Afterward, Schwarzenegger, a Republican, praised Obama, a Democrat, for the "huge victory" that brought all sides together.
Probably the biggest dose of reality that can be washed over the hype is the simple mathematics of the sport. Only 22 position players can start for a team in a given game. Each recruiting class consists of about 20-25 players deep. If all 20-25 become starters then we would rarely, if ever, have two-year starters.

After the vote, Prime Minister Petr Necas pledged to continue with austerity measures—although his government has been weakened by a corruption scandal and public opposition to budget cuts.
I first started thinking about Acts of Kindness after Break Down. Partly what intrigued me about that project was how much members of the public wanted to talk about it. People were very generous. Most people spend their lives working hard to accrue all these things and they put them on their shelves and they look after them, and I was doing quite the reverse of that. I could have been vilified but I wasn't. I came away thinking the general public are OK. Then, since I didn't have many things at that time, I started to think about what else makes us human apart from being consumers. What I started to ponder was compassion and kindness.

They all deserve a break.
