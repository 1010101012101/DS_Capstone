Along with outrage, stories about Gulnaz's situation have sparked the usual orgy of self-satisfaction on this side of the globe. A reader's comment posted online in response to a New York Times article about Gulnaz's pardon is typical. After expressing disbelief at the subjugation of women in "most of the Muslim world and large parts of Africa," the reader added: "By the way, I must once again say how much I love America. We have our problems but boy, we do it right!!!!!!!!!!!!" Even the liberal Daily Kos observed, "We could never imagine anything like this happening here."

That's the fault of director Phyllida Lloyd and screenwriter Abi Morgan, however, not Meryl Streep. Streep's portrayal of Margaret Thatcher, the grocer's daughter who grew up to become the first female prime minister of Great Britain (and the longest-serving of the 20th century) is spot-on. Streep's customary immersion in a role, perfecting the accent, the mannerism, the look, the feel, all are on display.

By calling Fluke and injecting himself into the Limbaugh controversy, Obama sent a message to more than one law student. He was reaching out to young voters and women — two groups whose support he needs in this re-election year. And he was underscoring that the White House, despite bungling its rollout of the birth control policy, sees it as a winning issue and welcomes Obama's name next to it.

In the NFL, there's revenue sharing, and the Vikings get one of the biggest shares of any team. Owners of teams such as the Cowboys, Redskins and Broncos, unhappy with contributing a lot of money to the pot, have been trying to eliminate revenue sharing. And if the Vikings moved to Los Angeles, certainly those other teams would have to contribute less because the Vikings would be contributing to the pot instead of taking from it.

While $2.4 billion is a huge figure, it pales in comparison to the likely costs of building such a pipeline. Million says that the project can be built for less than $3.2 billion, but an estimate done by the state of Colorado in 2011 pegged the number at closer to $9 billion. It seems unlikely that Million could find enough private investors to scrape together $9 billion, so ultimately some form of public financing would need to be involved. That's kind of like asking your neighbor to help you pay your water bill, then later forcing him to buy some of the water that comes out of your faucet.
This year, the Georgia Legislature passed the Responsible Dog Owner Act. Awaiting the governor’s signature, HB 685 is a public safety bill that revamps the antiquated dangerous dog law. It was a tempestuous two-year process, and the bill was amended several times. Thanks to a lobbyist for breeders, some valuable requirements were removed such as sterilizing a vicious dog. (Intact male dogs are involved in 70 percent to 76 percent of reported dog bite incidents.)

Remove livers from pan and drain well. Repeat with remaining livers.
The report contradicted a recent string of optimistic data, from retail sales to housing, leading many analysts to suggest the figures could be a statistical aberration rather than the beginning of a weakening labor market.

Several scientists not involved in the project said they were simultaneously thrilled and wary, calling the plan daring, difficult -- and pricey. They don't see how it could be cost-effective, even with platinum and gold worth nearly $1,600 an ounce. An upcoming NASA mission to return just 2 ounces (60 grams) of an asteroid to Earth will cost about $1 billion.

Karie E. Casey, 47, a lawyer with the downtown law firm Evans & Dixon, has a seizure disorder and couldn't drive a car for several years. But even now that she's been cleared to drive, she still bikes 16 miles round trip most days.
In baseball, the invention of the pitch-by-pitch record, reliably available only since 1988, has turned out to be important for much more than capturing the drama of one riveting seventh inning long ago. We now understand its utility for managing a pitcher's productivity, health and longevity. We don't need to go beyond Koufax to see that throwing too many pitches over too short a time can lead to debilitating injury. Despite suffering excruciating pain from arthritis in his elbow, he sometimes pitched under conditions that today would be considered abusive -- entire games on just two days' rest, for example. Baseball eventually figured out what constitutes abuse through analysis of the effects of game and season pitch counts, days of rest and age of the pitcher on performance and injury.
But real urban revival also depends on drawing a steady stream of smaller businesses with fewer employees, enterprises beneath the notice of politicians eager to hand out special deals and cut ribbons. The proposed tax increases could make downtown unattractive to many of them.
This composed salad from Aaron London of Ubuntu in Napa has a lot of parts, but the beets - be sure to use two varieties - can be made a day ahead, and the blue cheese mixture up to two days ahead.
For some reason, everyone is jumping on board the Wolfpack bandwagon, but we just don't see it. Yes, they score, they shoot and they rebound, but all those "big down-the-stretch wins" people are foaming over? Miami, Virginia Tech, Boston College and Virginia. Three letters: M-E-H.

Yet Ron Martinelli, founder of a California forensic consulting firm, said that Zimmerman was probably cleaned up when he was treated by paramedics at the scene and that in many cases there is no significant visual evidence of an injury.
You can't ever satisfy those cranks, because to them -- come what may -- a Democrat is still a Democrat. So Ohio Democrats might as well act like meat-and-potatoes Democrats, not Ivy League "triangulators." Even an Ohio kook can spot a phony.
The city is desperate to solve a problem that doesn't exist. If you liked the overnight removal of all the trees on California Avenue, you'll love the loss of half its lanes, with all the resulting traffic tie-ups and additional accidents. If you don't want California Avenue destroyed, write the city council today.
Weve actually had meetings with the airlines already to talk to them about the possibility of service, but obviously Id rather have a large number of people sign the petition, said Joe Cambron, director of air service development.

Apparently this is point in the show where the contestants get makeovers. Did Kristina really need that much makeup? Are they trying to make her look like Adele? What happened to the cute ‘50s chic she had going till now? Why did James need so many studs on his jacket? Why is Juliet blonde?

In New Jersey, 65 percent of those who are released from prison are arrested again within five years. But some people on parole go back to prison without committing new crimes. Federal statistics show one-third of state prison admissions nationwide are due to parole violations, and Mauer estimates half of them return for technical violations such as missing an appointment with a parole officer or failing a drug test.
To begin, we must care enough to show respect for the language and ourselves. Then we make the decision to change. The follow-through requires a concerted effort. We could bolster and help one another throughout this process.

Perhaps there is another approach to changing this country’s eating habits, one that embraces our freedoms while fattening up the economy. Hank Cardello, author of the book “Stuffed,” makes an argument for creating economic incentives for food producers in Tuesday’s Atlantic. “[W]e analyzed fifteen of the largest consumer packaged goods (CPG) corporations such as General Mills, Kraft Foods, Coca-Cola and Nestle and concluded that companies with above average sales of better-for-you (BFY) products enjoyed larger sales increases over a 5-year period, higher operating profits, better returns to shareholders and superior reputations,” he writes about the Hudson Institute’s study, Better-for-you Foods: It's Just Good Business. He concludes: “Companies are in business to make a profit and to maximize their shareholders' returns. I can see no better way for food and beverage companies to deliver on their missions than to speed up the proliferation of healthier, lower calorie offerings.”
Secondly . . . yeesh. Given that the publication of a book through the iBookstore is still subject to Apple's approval, it's possible that after months of effort a creator might wind up with a book that Apple refuses to sell, and which can't be sold elsewhere.

It was there, in the slop of Churchill Downs, that all the wheels came off.
When I saw Mike Posner drive the girlies wild at Bamboozle, I figured there were two ways this story could go. Either he could leave the frat house behind and step with confidence into post-collegiate society, or he'd treat his success as a sign from the gods of Alpha Beta Zeta Theta that his laddish attitude was his moneymaker. But I didn't expect him to curse out an ex-girlfriend by name, on a major label release. Ugh. If only he had chosen NJCU over Duke, I'll bet the chair of the English Department would have knocked some humility into him.

I have two arguments against him. First, dominion implies stewardship, not misuse to exhaustion. Second, and more important, I do not believe the environmental argument is about whether man or Earth is more important. Rather, it is an argument that if you continue to mess where you eat, you will not be able to eat there very long. Unfortunately, the days when you can just pick up and move to a new spot are gone.
These aims aren't always reached, and in the end the marriage dissolves. But since the Democrats and Republicans can't divorce, our only hope is that reconciliation is possible. For that hope to materialize, the points I've listed must become feasible. What they imply is a process. One of the biggest problems in Congress is that both sides want to skip the process and jump straight to the results.

Now, it's all about Stoudemire. Will he face disciplinary action from the Knicks? Will he come back next season? Will the Knicks try to move him and his uninsured deal, which still has three more seasons and around $64 million to run?

His Awesomeness, Jason Statham, has let it be known that he chooses his films based on the fight choreographer the producers hire. Often as not, that blows up in his face. Why else would the Human Bullet from Blighty end up in dogs like "War," "Transporter 3" and "Death Race"?
Under New Jersey law, someone who fails to report a death by accident or violence, or who disturbs a body, can be charged as a disorderly person. That would become a felony under Caylee's Law. It would also be a felony for a parent not to report a missing child within 24 hours of disappearance.

The size-and-expense issue was just one of three reasons Clement cited for calling the expansion coercive -- the other two being that refusing to cover the newly eligible could cost a state the aid it received for existing Medicaid enrollees, and that the expansion was tied to a "decidedly nonvoluntary" mandate to purchase insurance. But it was the most intriguing because it asks the justices to think about the political ramifications of a congressional action, not the legal ones.
Gardner wasn’t just an animal lover, he was also a car lover. He had painstakingly restored a 1960 Chevrolet Parkwood, doing the work by hand and dedicating the car to his grandmother, whose name was inscribed on the glove box. After the accident, Gardner’s girlfriend had promised him on his death-bed to get the car in shape for an upcoming car show.

Yes, now's the time. Given the quantities of butter and the roasted, toasted flavors in nearly everything, ou can unabashedly uncork the opulent, well-oaked Chardonnays you've been waiting to drink.

Any day now, Carlson predicts, police will raid the shop he's owned for 29 years and arrest him. But every day that doesn't happen puts another $16,000 or so in his till, Carlson estimates.

Jason Yip, a principal consultant at ThoughtWorks in Sydney, Australia, plays music such as Bob Marley's "Get Up, Stand Up," to round up colleagues. "It acts like a Pavlovian bell," he says.
Democrats are clearly enjoying the essential conundrum facing the GOP candidates and their supporters: Conservatives aren't wild about Mr. Romney, but the alternatives appear so flawed and their campaigns so disorganized and underfunded (as in Ohio, Mr. Santorum will not field a full slate of delegates in Illinois) that it's hard to see much benefit from this prolonged fighting — except for the incumbent.
South Carolina’s economy and culture are deeply tied to the military -- one-quarter of voters in the 2008 Republican primary here said they had served.

Jarecki is painstaking in his dissection of the subject as he poses the question to a host of people, from pundits and policymakers to regular folks at a Fourth of July celebration, particularly as it applies to the current conflict in Iraq, and gets an equally diverse batch of answers.

So I'm especially pleased that "Free Agents" didn't gain the unenviable distinction of being the first new show to get the ax. I didn't bother watching "The Playboy Club" after its dreadful pilot, so I suppose it could have gotten better. But as the ratings reflected, viewers avoided it like a sexually transmitted disease from the first episode on, so that's that.
SeaWorld San Diego's Manta represents a significantly more compact version of the 125-foot-tall, 3,500-foot-long Blue Fire coaster in Germany, which features heart rate monitors, video screens for each rider and lap bar-only restraints.

Not unlike its counterpart rock 'n' roll, memorable jazz novels occupy a pretty slim shelf at the local bookstore.

The problem for economists is that the crisis has, to some extent, reaffirmed this dour and previously discredited view. Prolonged prosperity from 1983 to 2007 bred bad habits and overconfidence. This does not mean that we know nothing or that we have no tools to combat savage recessions; after all, we did avoid a second Great Depression. But it does mean that one promise of modern economics -- to extend economic expansions and shorten slumps -- can create the conditions for its own failure. Although the conclusion is obvious, economists ignore it. The most likely reason is that it undermines their self-appointed role as agents of social progress.

His bill would create a special class of PERS beneficiaries for school employees, then reduce their retirement benefits by lowering the guaranteed return to their retirement accounts, reducing cost of living adjustments and limiting their benefits to a progressively lower percentage of final salary over time.

My fear is that the 24/7 media feedback loop is changing our anger calculus. Like porn on the Web, political anger is becoming a compulsion. The Joe Stacks of the world -- the ones who are mad as hell and about to fly a plane into an IRS office -- could always find compatriots, but now they can congregate instantly, on a fan page on Facebook, for instance. It's all become too easy, accessible and, in some cases, merely an end in itself.

Overall, this course can require a lot of gear-shifting. Newer riders may wonder: When is the best time to shift? The short answer is, before you really need to.

There are now two trams from Melbourne on the streets of San Francisco. The one that first attracted my attention was the 1928 W2-class tram.
