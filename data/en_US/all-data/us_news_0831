We get to the hotel at 12:30, knock on the door, and ... nothing. We knock louder. Nothing. We leave a card. As we depart, we smell an intoxicating aroma in the hallway, a mellow, yellow aroma that whispers, "Rock n' roll, baby." This has to be the place.

The CPR goes further by ending the guaranteed pension for new hires. There are some concerns about the legality of some of the provisions (such as excluding certain specialty pay from counting toward an employee's pension) and questions surrounding the ability for employees to opt back into Social Security.

Into this breach, states like Arizona have decided to take matters into their own hands. Given the levels of frustration across the country, this is understandable. But it is also ill conceived. And it's not just that the law Arizona passed is divisive -� although it has fanned the flames of an already contentious debate. Laws like Arizona's put huge pressures on local law enforcement to enforce rules that ultimately are unenforceable. It puts pressure on already hard-strapped state and local budgets. It makes it difficult for people here illegally to report crimes -� driving a wedge between communities and law enforcement, making our streets more dangerous and the jobs of our police officers more difficult.

After the game, and after seeing Jordan and Riley sitting together courtside, James made an emotional statement on the court that he was going to ditch jersey No. 23 out of respect to Jordan. In fact, he felt all players should stop wearing No. 23.

The PSD needs to fund School Improvement Programs for 2012-2013 in a timely manner. If they don't, our PTO's may have to make some difficult decisions and some of our PTO's do not have enough money to cover the School Improvements Programs plus their regular budget items.

Yet there's no evidence that states that attach criminal penalties to the failure to report child abuse have lower rates of abuse than states that don't. On the contrary, criminalizing the failure to report carries its own troubling risks. The threat of prosecution could inundate authorities with a flood of spurious reports that overwhelm investigators and make it even more difficult to identify those children who are truly in danger. Given that two-thirds of abuse reports are ultimately found to be unsubstantiated, some child advocates argue that the last thing the system needs is for more people to report their suspicions just for the sake of making sure they are protected from criminal liability in case abuse is actually occurring.

Indeed, I can't think of any other opera that so convincingly bewails the horrors of poverty while making most of the resulting hardships seem so deeply romantic. Cold weather permeates "La Bohème" — it begins on a frozen Christmas Eve in the garrets of Paris — and yet the impression we take away with us is that of a suffusion of human warmth. It is a world in microcosm, pulsing, youthful, meticulously detailed and deeply believable — flesh and blood behaving as flesh and blood always have and always will.

Colombia has become a security success story because they had the courage to fight the drug cartels and the narco-terrorists of the FARC. Out of that struggle, Colombia has emerged as a security exporter with robust government institutions and a successful free-enterprise system. But the fight is not finished, and the U.S. must continue its support, including providing Colombia access to armed, unmanned aerial vehicles. Countries like Colombia can then be security exporters to the emerging trouble spots of Honduras and Guatemala.

Logically, then, Vino Noceto's riserva sangiovese is more powerful than other takes on the varietal in its portfolio, yet it still conveys the grape's easygoing nature, sunniness and balance. Its structure is more solid, its tannins more evident, but it has the telltale liveliness that characterize other sangioveses in the Vino Noceto lineup. It is readily drinkable with food right now, especially dishes that include husky cuts of meat. It will be even smoother in another three years, and should continue to develop handsomely for a decade.
DelBarba intends it to be that way.

South Florida (20-13, RPI 53): Bulls might be on the very top of the bubble, a team the selection committee should mull over for a while. They're just 1-9 against the RPI top 50, beating Louisville, but the top-30 strength of schedule could give them a little more consideration. Prediction: In.
But if action films tend to come from the right, horror films tend to come from the left.

I'd barely heard of the East Cape when I first visited there five years ago, and the rutted dirt roads nearly voided my rental-car contract. Air-conditioning was a rare luxury; solar and generator power ruled.

Active types and fans of primitive, wide open spaces will still find plenty to love, but be aware that Baja Sur has big plans to turn this region into the Cabo Riviera one day. The paved highway, making its way south from La Ribera, will eventually run all the way to the Los Cabos airport.

Now with the economy in the tank, food prices, gas prices and utility bills climbing, we don't know what to do. Is bankruptcy an option? Our bills are current right now, but there is barely enough for groceries. We still have equity in our home and have a 5.5 percent interest rate.

"This ruling on SB 1070 should have provided Washington the opportunity to fix this," said U.S. Rep. Harry Mitchell, D-Ariz. "There's no excuse for not securing the borders and fixing the broken immigration system - there's no excuse whatsoever. But it's an election year, and politicians are motivated to grandstand and to score political points instead of trying to help fix the problem.

If, on the other hand, the measure is somehow resurrected before year's end and the tax cut extended, voters might be willing to forget the momentary insanity. After snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, the GOP would at least look like they had their act back together, however belatedly.
Neither Ackerman nor creator/executive producer Scott Silveri has Portland connections, so they're relying on series star Kyle Bornheimer's brother, Ryan, to keep them honest with local references.

Cruz. The amazing part is he now has four 100-yard games and is 43 yards away from 1,000 for the season yet he's still working to refine his game. If you noticed, Manning came to him after a handful of plays and was gesturing for ways to run better routes or hit different spots in coverage. To think, he can still get so much better.

Obamacare seems a dead end, entitlement liberalism's "bridge too far" -- a flawed attempt to impose central planning on an enormously complicated economic sector.

The mythology implicit in the plot offers great potential for storytelling and puzzle-solving, and you'd think would be put to good use here. Instead, whatever mythos exists bobs almost unnoticed in a sticky pool produced by incessant hacking, slashing and garroting. Perseus' goal, it appears, is to cut through a wide array of baddies and bosses like a weed-wacker through a scrubby field, gaining a degree of personal energy with each bloody death but not much insight or awareness.
Merage Foundations Executive Director Marshall Kaplan presented a leadership award to Rob Balen, El Sol Academy’s Board Chair, and spoke about a newly-formed partnership with Share Our Selves, which will establish a wellness center at the school.

But the real star is the C8 Spyder, a supercar from Dutch automaker Spyker. At $237,000, buying the convertible would put you in an exclusive club of fewer than 150 people in the United States. With a dashboard covered with chrome toggle switches, and an exposed gearshift that runs the length of the car, the Spyker looks like it was designed by a yacht maker in the 1920s.

Sending Mr. Roos—instead of President Barack Obama going himself—could help to defuse any pressure in Japan on the U.S. to comment on its position on the atomic bombings, as well as from those in the U.S. critical of what they dub the president's "apology tours" abroad.

Think of all the money Danny Ainge could have squandered elsewhere had Doc Rivers turned Kevin Garnett into a center before Shaq and Jermaine O’Neal. K.G. has owned Josh Smith the past five years. Versus K.G., Smith averages 13.0 points and 36.1 percent shooting. His averages against everyone else: 16.7 and 47.7. On the flip side, Garnett is 15.9 and 52.5 percent against the masses during that same span and 18.2 and 52.3 against Smith, who is coming off his finest season and must keep K.G. from mentally taking him out of his game. Or will Rivers give Garnett a break and stick undersized Brandon Bass on Smith?

Driving the GOP effort is a desire to avert a $55 billion cut—about 10 percent—to the Pentagon budget and a $43 billion cut to domestic agencies starting Jan. 1. There's bipartisan opposition to this so-called sequester, but it's not at all clear what part the cuts proposed by Republicans will play in any ultimate solution. Many budget observers believe any solution to the sequester, as well as what to do about the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts at the same time, will be postponed until after the November election.

9. There has been considerable Internet celebration over the Bears adding offensive lineman James Brown as an undrafted free agent from Troy. Slow down. While the Bears kept five undrafted free agents a year ago, that won’t happen this year. It wasn’t a sign of improved scouting when they did it. It was a sign they had open spots at the bottom of the roster because of poor drafting. ESPN’s Mel Kiper banged the drum for Brown throughout the draft and had him rated as a third-round pick. So, I called a scout I trust and asked him why the Bears and 31 other teams passed on Brown through seven rounds. He explained off-field issues that I won’t get into here because I can’t document it. Maybe Brown pushes for a spot on the practice squad and that would be a good thing. The Bears need a developmental prospect and Mike Tice has done well with projects throughout his career. But Brown is unlikely to solve any issues this season. He played a lot of football at Troy but struggled at the Senior Bowl, another reason his stock fell with teams. He had several offers to sign with other teams and chose the Bears. It’s worth wondering if his agent Bus Cook, who also represents quarterback Jay Cutler, steered him this direction.

"I think that's why a lot of the (football) schools have departed because they're carrying the show and too many people with the round ball are making the decisions," O'Leary said a few days ago on his weekly radio show.

A majority of survey respondents - 51 percent - said they would choose a smaller home within walking distance of workplaces and shops, rather than a single-family home with a big yard, which required driving almost everywhere they wanted to go.

The clearest way forward would be through a convention targeting dictatorship as an international crime. Rather than treating dictatorship as an ancillary issue in the prosecution of other crimes, this would focus attention on the types of atrocities and oppression in which dictators engage. These crimes include the curtailment of certain civil liberties -- such as the freedoms of association, speech and press -- state interference with institutions such as the judiciary and electoral bodies, and oppressive regulation of personal autonomy. Moreover, nations could incorporate this criminalization into domestic law, providing an additional forum in which to publicize violations and prosecute violators.

" 'Game of Thrones' is a sexual world, but it's also one that has to condense a lot of information," says Maureen Ryan, TV critic for the Huffington Post. Especially, she says, since the show's writers want to be true to the novels. Sexposition can be useful for any scene that might otherwise be considered pretty boring, mostly for a lack of action and an overabundance of dialogue, she says. It proves unsuccessful, Ryan says, when the combination of sex and a big "information download" is so jarring ­­— so much of a circus — that it takes a viewer out of the show and becomes cliche.

So they're unlikely to become drugs for the prevention of lung cancer, as they currently are for breast cancer.

"He was a versatile guy in Boston, moved him up and down the lineup," Hitchcock said. "He's one of those guys that's an underrated player, kind of a glue guy for the hockey club. He fits the way we play. You're trying to build a work ethic and you're trying to build an edge to your game and he's a tough little guy.
