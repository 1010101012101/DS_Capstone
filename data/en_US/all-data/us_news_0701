• UCLA Basketball: "Every Game is a Must Win" -- Bruins Nation: While part of me thinks it is refreshing for a coach to be overly pessimistic instead of Chianti Dan like on the PAC 12 South football title; I wish he had had not said it. I think the PAC 12 regular season champion has a good shot to go to the 68 team tourney. Also, anything can happen in any one game in a tourney like the PAC 12 so it would be very good to still win the PAC 12 regular season title. I think CBH realizes that when he says every game is a "must win."

The move, announced Saturday, signals that Beijing is increasingly confident that the yuan, also known as the renminbi, is fairly valued, a key requirement if it is to relax its grip on the currency. China points out that its trade surpluses have declined. It recorded a $5.4 billion trade surplus in March, after a $31.5 billion deficit in February. China's loosened controls on the yuan come just days before the International Monetary Fund is expected to sharply reduce its long-term forecast of China's current-account surplus, the broadest measure of a nation's trade.

Tom Shepard, Reed's chief of staff, argued that the city faces a certain lawsuit if it passes Slay's bills. And then, he said, the city will be stuck in the same position it is now – paying the debts of previous legal losses. "That's just proof positive that bad decisions stick," he told the aldermen.

While the performance level never varied, the quality of the actual material certainly did. Coldplay has a handful of truly magical compositions, which stand tall among the best alt-rock tunes of the last dozen years, and the ones performed live in San Jose certainly thrilled the 15,000-strong audience.

His career WHIP of 1.183 and years of abysmal run support from the Giants do a better job of explaining his performance. His agent can say that. So can his manager. He won't.

By searching for artists, special subjects or media, site visitors can create their own online collections complete with commentary and sound effects. It’s especially fun to search for big themes like “food,” which turned up dozens of things ranging from 18th century Chinese-lacquer boxes and a sleek 1950 meat slicer at the MIA to a Walker video interview with artist Rirkrit Tiravanija, who once cooked a meal in a Walker gallery and left the dirty dishes there for weeks.The site claims to have 94,000 works and allows the tech-savvy to click-and-drag images and text to their own customized “art collection.”

As I stood for hours waiting on that runway, waiting, my tension increased as my mind wandered. I started thinking about the many ways I could mess up the pictures of this flight test. Adding to my stress was the fact that I wasn't shooting with my trusty film camera. Instead, I was using one of the first digital cameras, a type that I wasn't yet experienced with. I was part of the beta testing of the world's first integrated digital photographic systems.
There are people who want to do away with anything that seems rigid or repressive in religion, to which I say a loud Amen. Many others find mainline churches entirely too reasonable, too helpful, too focused on the positive to the exclusion of the harsher realities of life; to them I also say Amen. My soul longs for mystery and thirsts for the sacraments; I am not much swayed by happy talk.

Mr. Rodricks' observations on the enormous human costs of the Iraq war were absolutely appropriate to the occasion. The war in Iraq was a conflict initiated under the dishonest pretext that Saddam Hussein was somehow "behind" the hijackers of September 2001. As Mr. Rodricks pointed out, scant attention has been paid to the hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths that were the consequence. Remarkably, hardly any other public commenter on the Sept. anniversary — certainly not Mr. Bush himself — acknowledged these grim results of U.S. foreign policy. Mr. Obama even boasted that in the 10 years since the attacks, "it has been shown that those who mean us harm can't hide anywhere in the world," vague words which could easily be interpreted to include Iraq, Afghanistan or even Libya.

• Vince Grippi, The Spokesman-Review: Pac-12 teams adjust to tougher rules on secondaries: More often than not this season, seemingly, the flags have flown.

Highlights: "In our game against Century this year, I scored seven goals and had one assist. ... Another highlight this season was playing against Jesuit; after a rough start to the game, I scored a goal to get the offense running. In the game, I ended with five goals and one assist with a final score, winning 9-7. With 39 points (29 goals, 10 assists) and six games completed in the season so far, I hope to keep pushing our team's pace and keep winning games. Being a team captain is a great responsibility that I have earned this year."
I don't usually eat breakfast, but the prospect of a pre-noon meal in Vegas of something other than strawberries was too good to pass up, so the next morning at Society Café Encore consisted of a blood orange mimosa and (faux) egg flatbread ($13). The drink was yummy, but it was the nearly foot-long flatbread with spinach, two types of vegan cheese, fake eggs and vegan sausage that I'll come back for. If you're vegan and hung over (and you're in Vegas, so you are), this is a mandatory must-have.

The water park also features a lazy river, a hot tub, a large water-filled playground area, a kiddie pool and two three-story-tall water slides that take you outdoors before dumping you in a swirling pool. You use an inner tube on one of them, a fairly easy but fun ride, though riders under 4 feet tall aren't allowed. Both of my adventuresome parents, in their 60s, went on this slide. But I was the only one to brave the tubeless green slide, a superfast ride that you go down lying flat on your back. Children who are too short for the big slides can use a third slide; however, it may seem too small for kids older than 6.

It’s not that Perry is a bad pop star or a poor singer. It’s that her success is completely out of whack with her abilities and aspirations. Perry has had five No. 1 singles in a row from her “Teenage Dream” album, and just when it seemed like there was no chance she could squeeze out another, “The One That Got Away” has crawled into the Top 10. “The One” is featherweight, as are all Perry singles, but it’s more listenable than the awkward “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.).” Should Perry claim the top spot for the sixth time in a row, she’ll have accomplished something that no singer has since Whitney Houston. It is hard to make the case that pop music is in robust condition when a figure as flimsy as Perry can dominate it.

The latter point reinforces the reality that the burden of two wars, one of them a war of choice in Iraq, continues to fall on a very narrow segment of the American population -- the men and women in uniform and their families left back home.

California's rate was 5.3; the U.S. national average was 5.0.

Entertainment Weekly has a recap by Tim Stack, who notes: "It’s a little Hitchcock, a little soap opera, and a lot over the top.

Most young children like being in the garden but are not yet interested in gardening. They see it as a chore, although there are exceptions. They like plants that grow quickly since immediate satisfaction is high on their lists.

But, in a sense, the Uptown Sound is its own acting gig. The band came together through a Craigslist ad placed by Bungeroth in 2007.

"In simple words, all that's happened is disappointing. I don't know why did we go in there in the first place and why we are leaving. It tells me that there was no clear-cut policy about what is the mission. I don't know anyone who can answer that. Because I don't think there was a clear-cut mission beyond just getting rid of Saddam, which was successful, obviously. But is the country any better now than 10 years ago? That's the question to be answered. I don't know. I would say it's at least not achieving what the expectation was."

Either bill would give consumers more information about their doctors, and empower the Board of Registration for the Healing Arts to take action against dangerous doctors.
In other words picking specific numbers or parameters to make lists can skew the picture somewhat. Nevertheless, there is a huge generality here: The ranks are rather sparse of players who dropped to the depths Jeter dropped to in 2010 and ’11 then rebounded to have even one good season, much less an extended run. It is just about barren for shortstops. Thus, for Jeter to maintain even a strong 2012 would be historically impressive, and to take a real run at 3,500 — and maybe even 4,000 — hits would make one of the most unique players of all time even more so.

I remember when Santa Monica Boulevard was the worst street in town, with its picket fence of high power lines, the buzzing transformers, the abandoned streetcar line down the middle, a million ugly billboards and porn theaters. Now it's adorable, complete with park median and terrific bars and shops. I've seen quiet, anonymous Mid-City become Koreatown, with its high-density shopping and late-night scenes. I remember when there was a kiddie amusement park where the Beverly Center is now. I remember the Los Angeles County Museum of Art when they hadn't yet killed off the Ahmanson gallery by walling in the atrium. There used to be a pretty gift shop that ornamented the entry, full of unusual trinkets and bright Japanese paper goldfish kites, and I still can taste the excitement of looking across and seeing all the open galleries, how electrifying it all was. Now it looks like King Tut's tomb. Before they opened it.

And that’s what we’ve done over the years — for the part that we use.” She said the association has put about $10,000 back into the barn.

American Samoa has a smaller range of lodging options because tourism here is less developed than in independent Samoa. I stayed on the harbor in Pago Pago, at the Sadie Thompson Inn, 633-5981, http://www.sadieshotels.com, ($160 a night double but ask about specials), a small hotel with a very good restaurant. It's named for the main character in "Rain," a 1920s short story, set in American Samoa, by W. Somerset Maugham.

One of the pitfalls of having so many characters west of the Narrow Sea is that there will be episodes where our young khaleesi Dany is absent or only seen briefly. She’s dispatched her bloodriders in three directions, and true to the show’s brutality, Rakharo has returned as a head in his saddlebag. His mate wails that he “won’t be able to join his ancestors in the Night Lands,” and things look bleaker than ever for Dany and her upstart band of dragon enthusiasts.
Loyola University in Baltimore said it will not make any immediate changes to its health offerings because of the decision. A health maintenance organization plan offered to employees covers prescription contraception, but another plan is more restrictive. The HMO, which has fewer subscribers, covers prescription contraception because of mandates the university was required to follow when the plan was created.

Unlike many fairs I've attended recently, this one didn't have a long line of applicants winding around the building, anxiously waiting to get in the door. Perhaps it's a sign that the economy is indeed inching its way back. More likely, it was the heat.
Beyond that, German policy has already hard-wired austerity into the euro-zone structures and into legislation across the bloc in changes introduced since the debt crisis's onset. Slovakia and the Netherlands may change governments but their pledges to keep to the new budget rules remain.

Carpenter hit his second homer of the spring and his second extra-base knock of the game to lead off the sixth inning. Carpenter jumped the first pitch he saw from Mets starter Dillon Gee for a solo homer over the left-field wall. The lefthanded-hitting Carpenter has 11 extra base hits this spring, and manager Mike Matheny has said that the power spike is not unexpected. Carpenter used to swing from a standstill, and over the previous two seasons he's worked on getting a load and some momentum into his swing. This spring, John Mabry and Mark McGwire have worked with him on using his legs to generate that weight shift that could unlock more power from the utility fielder.

Van Zandt said Karr, who was unable to pay $100,000 bail in his 2001 child pornography case, served six months in jail while awaiting trial in 2001. That means he likely already served the bulk of whatever sentence would be coming to him if found guilty, she said.

The sport's governing body, the International Skating Union, took more than a month to review film of his performance before certifying the jump on Oct 26.

"See, in a sense, what allows me to do this, to paint some of what I painted and write some of the things I have written about this job, is that most of my passengers don't think of me as a person," Samarov said. "They think of me as part of the furniture. And I am. They say and do things they wouldn't do around other people. Because they simply don't regard me. Not everyone. But on a base level, that's true of a lot of people. And I get it. The back of my head is turned to them, which makes a difference. They feel looser. That said, probably, most don't try to talk to me, and I don't start conversations. I'm comfortable in silence."
"That sounds like a crazy thing to do," said Snow, founder and owner of Scott Snow Financial Advisors LLC in Westlake. "Mortgage rates are at all-time lows, and the stock market has pulled back significantly during the past three months. I think this is the worst time to be cashing in stocks, which have good long-term growth potential, for an asset like a home, where you're lucky to get your money back when you sell it 10, 20, 30 years down the road.

I am sorry, P. I grew up, eventually. I am now a responsible, caring teacher, who doesn't tolerate that type of behavior.

The NFL Players Association received the confidential March 2 and March 21 reports on the Saints matter that were distributed to the clubs. In addition, members of the NFL staff, including the NFL security investigators, met with NFLPA officials to review the results of their investigation. A number of current and former players, including each player disciplined today, were offered the opportunity to be interviewed with counsel present. One player (Hargrove) submitted a written statement in which he did not dispute the existence of the program, but no player agreed to be interviewed in person. In addition, the NFLPA publicly stated that it conducted its own investigation into this matter, but it has shared no information from that investigation with the NFL.

If that's a cult, then maybe Rev. Jeffress should sign up for some lessons.
One complication is that there are overpass and railroad bridge piers that prevent MoDOT from just slapping an extra lane along what is now the highway shoulder. So the state will do what it did when it added temporary lanes to part of Interstate 70 and I-44 a few years ago while Highway 40 was being rebuilt.
PUBLIC PENSION IDENTITIES: The Salem Statesman-Journal explores the death of a bill aimed at preventing the continued release of the names and pension amounts of retirees in the Oregon Public Employees Retirement System.

What it's about: Superheroes are summoned by a secret government agency to battle an alien invasion.
They'll also get a boost from a change in the Olympic competition. In the past, it was single elimination, where one mistake could be enough to send a team home. But this year the first round will be conducted in a pool-play format, meaning a typically slow-starting team like Gunawan-Bach could lose its first match yet still advance to the next round.

But as you make your viewing plans, be forewarned: These teams may have scored a lot of points, but they aren't actually very good. In fact, they may be the most defense-challenged, star-dependent and choke-prone teams ever to vie for the English Premier League crown.
But she is a Democrat in a Democratic state, and she could not ignore that the mortgage crisis is centered in California. Given the circumstances, she had little choice. Voters' opinions do matter. In this instance, the right policy is good politics.

Historically, Oregon technology has specialized in computer hardware. Software developers and executives tended to congregate in Seattle and the Silicon Valley. When Portland startups had success, they often moved away to tap talent pools and funding resources in those tech communities.
What I reject is the idea that this has any intrinsic value whatsoever other than voyeurism. One of the degrees of hell of this decadence is narcissism: What I feel in this moment is more important than anything else on Earth, everything else be damned other people close to me, people far away from me, the plight of people around the world that we're bound to whether we know it or not.

Shot in dark, stormy Ireland and on the bright seas and sands of Puerto Rico, the movie re-creates the world of seafaring men, including pirates, in such detail that you can almost taste the salt on their cracked lips, feel the sting of the tattoo blade and smell the desperation when the hunt for buried gold becomes a grim battle to survive.
But two is apparently not enough. Less than three blocks from each location, yet another Walgreens is being fashioned out of the old Tower Records store that was once a touchstone of music and culture.

This will be the 14th Final Four appearance for Kansas. The Jayhawks are 3-5 in title games. Forward Clyde Lovellette led them in 1952, when they defeated St. John's, 80-63, for the championship. In 1988, forward Danny Manning keyed an 83-79 title win over Oklahoma. In 2008, with guards Mario Chalmers and Brandon Rush and forwards Darrell Arthur and (former Cavalier) Darnell Jackson, Kansas rallied for a 75-68 overtime championship win over Memphis.
Yes, I still think that Blackmon is worthy of the No. 6 overall pick. It doesn't take blazing speed to be an elite receiver, just look at Larry Fitzgerald. And Blackmon runs fast enough – he showed that at his pro day. You also have to wonder about Floyd because of his three alcohol-related incidents. Lastly, you need a trading partner to trade down, and at this point it doesn't seem like there's any one player worth trading up for. If you're a quarterback-needy team anxious to get Ryan Tannehill, you need to get ahead of Miami at No. 8, so the team you'd be talking to about a trade would be Jacksonville at No. 7 not the Rams at No. 6.

Much like an earlier GOP plan to privatize Social Security several years ago, it is the Republican proposal to change the Medicare that could have a lasting impact on either side of the debate.
And now a nation descends on him. Piers Morgan demands to know if he'd allow women as members at August National. Bubba said he would, but he also respects the club's rules. Watson bought the General Lee, the car from "The Dukes of Hazzard" for $110,000, but that car has a confederate flag painted on its roof. So NASCAR nixed the idea of a parade lap in the General Lee in Phoenix. And like Tim Tebow's, Watson's outspoken Christian beliefs surely are to be dissected.

"I just read online the story you did for the fallen firefighter and I have to tell you it was the best written story ever. As I sat here reading tears fell freely. As a daughter of a firefighter this hit so close to home. I am no longer in Missouri as my husband is in the U.S. Army and we are stationed at Ft. Hood in Texas but I try to stay up to date with things back home. You wrote this story with such passion it felt like I was there the whole time at each shift change. My heart goes out to his parents and the surrounding communities. Firefighters take care of their own and your story shows just how much they do. Thank you for writing such a great and emotional story."
