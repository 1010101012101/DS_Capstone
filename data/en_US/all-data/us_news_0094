However, a new report from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission leaked to the New York Times suggests that the continued pumping of water into the plant may be putting a strain on the Fukushima facility that will leave it more susceptible to future earthquakes.
But if White has a brain in his head and more than a grain of political self-protection remaining in his soul, then after Smith either resigns or is kicked out of the House, White will make extra sure that the 10th District finally gets a capable, hardworking, smart state legislator who respects his or her constituents and works hard every day on their behalf.

And that is essentially what that opening dedication is all about - diverse interests and balance. It is not about listening to your sisters' old vinyl while you plow through a sixer of your newest craft brew discovery - not that kind of diversity. It's about wanting to try several beers in the same night, but not wanting to drain eight pints in the process. But eight half-pints? OK, that's a little more reasonable.
Final approval to set up the facility on Grove Street would come from the state Department of Environmental Protection, said Nicholas Maddaloni, solid waste and recycling programs coordinator for the Essex County Utilities Authority.

- Pursuing regional sustainability as good economics through the Climate Prosperity Project. Led by RCGA Board Chairwoman for Energy and Environment Tracy Hart, president of Tarlton Corp., this focuses on growing a work force for green-economy jobs (a recent analysis showed 9,000 jobs, one of the fastest-growing sectors in the region), encouraging companies to capitalize on "green savings, " and generating "green opportunities" by creating sustainable industries. As part of the St. Louis Climate Prosperity Project, the RCGA and the Missouri Botanical Garden launched the St. Louis Green Business Challenge earlier this year to measure savings and sustainability achievements at company headquarters in six areas: outreach. St. Louis is paired with Silicon Valley, Portland, Ore., and Denver in the national Climate Prosperity Project.

The Falcons topped Glenelg, 3-1, in eight innings.

Severna Park then scored two runs the next inning that included an RBI single by Paige Briganti and a double by first baseman Emma Yale.

All of the exciting reasons to vote for Mr. Obama are gone. Even his accomplishments don't excite people, never mind his failures. His "Yes, we can" rhetoric is gone because it sounds stupid after four years of "No, we didn't." Now we get cynicism and fear-mongering. His attacks on the Republicans are tawdry and desperate. He even admits the "Buffett Rule" is a gimmick. Other issues, like green energy, are passé now even though gas prices continue to soar. (A troubling sign for Mr. Obama: Only a third of hybrid car owners are interested in ever getting another after they get rid of the one they have.)

Companies have pulled back sharply on hiring after adding an average of 215,000 jobs per month from February through April. The economy typically needs to add 125,000 jobs per month just to keep up with population growth. And at least twice that many jobs are needed to bring down the unemployment rate.

Colombian prostitutes and lavish partying in Vegas inspire hot headlines -- and understandably infuriate the public. But concerned as President Obama must be over the unfolding embarrassments in the Secret Service and the General Services Administration, he may actually be comforted by the feeble attempts of a few politicians to wring political profit from those scandals. The likelihood that the White House is implicated can be measured by their stature.

On earlier visits, she had fallen in love with Filoli ("one of the most beautiful gardens in America") and Western Hills Nursery's garden near Occidental, and was befriended by Berkeley garden designer Mai Arbegast: "She took me under her wing and taught me a lot of things." Hobhouse was prepared with a list of climate-suitable plants, but admits to having been nervous about her new client.
Vixen Creations was started in 1992 by Marily Bishara, who was a Bay Area IT consultant who literally saw a hole in the sex toy market that needed to be, ahem, filled.

It was planted in 1991 by C.T. Lin, a home builder who immigrated from Taiwan and Japan, and Norm Jones, a longtime airline pilot, now retired. According to his story, Lin, who trained as an architect and later grew yuzu, came up with the variety by hybridizing two mandarins, a satsuma and a ponkan, in a Montana greenhouse in the 1980s. (This would be a difficult cross to make, since satsumas have sterile pollen and rarely produce seeds, but it's not impossible.) He later sold half the Temecula property to Jones, who now manages it.

U.K. officials are now fielding questions about how quickly they acted in pursuing answers about Mr. Heywood's death. As The Wall Street Journal reported, people familiar with the matter say British consular officials in China expressed suspicion over the death of a British businessman in its immediate aftermath last November, but the case wasn't initially pursued because other U.K. officials believed that asking the Chinese to investigate would be problematic. The U.K. didn't ask the Chinese for an investigation until mid-February.

At the camp, Pavel walked us briskly around the old fortress, which had been converted to house thousands of Jews during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. And he explained that Terezin had been used in propaganda films designed to display the supposedly humane treatment of refugees and to hide the truth of the Holocaust from the eyes of the world. Newsreels showed inmates planting gardens and playing soccer, but nothing was quite as it appeared. Each scene was carefully scripted and performed by actors who could not refuse their roles.

This stirring up of old memories is not good for Jacky, not good at all. But paradoxically, now that we know the past, the more savagely he acts the more we feel for him. And the more we see how tragic his fate is as a brooding outcast, all but consumed by fires of anger that can never be extinguished. Very much in the pattern of Frankenstein, Jacky is a monster we sympathize with even if we flinch at the monstrousness of what he does.

It's no coincidence that the five teams that have been No. 1 or 2 this year — North Carolina, Syracuse, Kentucky, Ohio State and Missouri — are among college basketball's most popular and valuable teams. According to a 2010 survey conducted by Forbes Magazine, North Carolina was tops, valued at $29 million, followed by Kentucky at $26.2 million. Ohio State was seventh ($18.3 million) and Syracuse eighth ($17 million). Meaning that the combination of the team's popularity combined with the drawing power attached to top-ranked teams, usually means a financial windfall for the road venues they travel to.

When that happens, it won't matter who's in charge or whose plan is in place. It will just make life more miserable for everyone -- most especially the city's beleaguered residents.

"Inside Deep Throat" was produced by Brian Grazer, whose introduction to the once outrageous, now rather quaint blue blockbuster came, fittingly, via his grandmother. It was directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato ("The Eyes of Tammy Faye," "Monica in Black and White"), who have a nose for sniffing out consequence in the outwardly ridiculous. The documentary doesn't plumb the depths of the movie that inspired it (there are none) so much as it explores the uses to which it was put by interests as diverse and contradictory as the Nixon administration, a newly politically active Christian right, the mob, lefty feminist activists and the then-burgeoning porn industry. It examines "Deep Throat's" lasting cultural effect and finds it to be not unlike the fertile crescent of the modern culture wars. Both the current zeal to legislate "moral values" and the cynical modern porn industry can be traced to the same event — the release and unlikely success of what must be the pluckiest and dumbest, in a cute way, porn movie ever made.
"Homeland" also received a Best Actor nomination for star Damian Lewis, Best Actress nomination for Claire Danes (who won Sunday) and three nominations for various writing awards handed out by the Writers Guilf of America.

In addition to finding the best possible practitioner, you need to do your part beforehand. If your insides aren't as immaculate as you can get them, it's harder to detect polyps, especially the flat kind on the right side of the colon (which this study found to be a potential blind spot). There are variations on the prep, which is basically a clear-liquid diet for some period of time plus laxatives. Following to the letter whichever version your doctor recommends is the best way to ensure an unobscured view of the walls of your bowel, says Sidney Winawer, an attending gastroenterologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney swiftly disagreed with Obama.
But borrowers may want to consider the Federal Reserve's announcement last week that it is slowing down a program intended to lower mortgage rates and boost the housing market.

One thing you'll notice about "BFF" is that despite the friction between Joe and Jessica, the show isn't mean. In recent years, wisecracks have become the go-to comedic form for sitcom writers, so much so that after a couple episodes of, say, "2 Broke Girls," you want to break out your handy-dandy Norman Vincent Peale just to feel good about the human race again. In the first episode, at least, "BFF" doesn't fall often into that trap.

Only one night's lodging was a disappointment. In the small and lovely village of Wotton-Under-Edge, we'd booked at the Swan Hotel, which looked in pictures like a typical small historic hotel. To be fair, it was undergoing renovations, and we were the only guests the night we stayed. But the room was tired, the bathroom corners grimy and the noise from the pub below continued late into the night. We were glad to be off early the next morning.

One teacher I spoke with during a recent trip talked about the luxury of being pursued by different charter networks willing to pay for her talents. After 11 years of teaching, she said, it was the first time she felt she was being treated as a professional. I visited the classrooms of Sci Academy, where 99 percent of the students are minorities and 92 percent are eligible for free and reduced-price lunch. They have some of the city's highest scores on statewide tests, and more than 90 percent of Sci Academy seniors have already been accepted to a four-year college or university. At O. Perry Walker College and Career Preparatory High School, one of the first charters to open after Katrina, the mostly African-American student body has turned in dramatic gains in achievement.

From here on in, James provides the reader with a no-nonsense, pithy education on the bedrock of the detective novel, distinguished from other forms of fiction by "a highly organized structure and recognized conventions." Her analysis of Agatha Christie astutely points to the lack of innovation but commends the author's ability to produce a consistently "strong and exciting narrative, the challenge of a puzzle, an accommodating and accessible style and original detectives . . . whom readers can encounter in book after book with the comfortable assurance that they are meeting old friends."

This creative solution is transforming a bastion of elitism into a more relevant and welcoming place.

We made it home to the Brooklyn Heights exit, and I lost power steering and acceleration. I coasted up the ramp before completely stopping on the berm. A number of residents stopped and asked if we needed help (for which I've known for a long time Brooklyn Heights is a great place to live), and a number of Good Samaritans who we didn't know stopped also. My husband was amazed at the good people who were concerned and kind enough to ask if they could help us. Thanks to all of you."

Yet given the Postal Service's projected $14 billion deficit next year, innovation alone probably cannot stave off reductions in payroll, properties and services such as Saturday delivery. Rather than prohibiting such changes -- congressional handcuffs are one reason the Postal Service is in such a deep financial hole -- lawmakers should give the Postal Service a fighting chance. That could include a fresh look at onerous pension-contribution requirements that the Postal Service complains have catapulted it toward insolvency.

The top prospects: Alabama's Mark Barron is the top strong safety prospect in the draft. He has good size and was stout against the run for the Crimson Tide. Notre Dame's Harrison Smith projects as a safety who can do a little bit of everything. He is fast enough with good instincts and cover skills. There doesn’t appear to be a consensus top free safety in April’s draft, but that could change once someone steps up at the combine.

It's worth noting that the festival isn't having an attendance problem. Nicholson said he expects the final 2008 attendance figure to be in the neighborhood of 390,000-395,000. Though that's down from the previous season, 2007 was a record-setting year, with around 405,000 customers. What's put the festival perhaps $400,000 under budget for ticket revenue, however, is that many theatergoers opted for lower-priced seats this season.

Casino companies, which are closely regulated, commonly have provisions in their legal documents to address issues of compliance among shareholders. Wynn's articles of incorporation, written in 2002, state that people found unsuitable to own shares by the board may have to wait 10 years to be paid back at fair value, with 2% interest per year. That language is unusually favorable to the company, legal experts said.

For large craft breweries, the demand for American beer abroad creates a more pressing problem than shipping headaches. Koch says rising illegal beer trafficking is one reason why Stone decided to build a brewery abroad. "I've seen our beers in Australia, and we don't sell there," he says of the growing underground ring of illegal exports. Koch says black-market beers are often procured from illicit distributors or by individuals who buy a retail store's entire inventory. He hopes to curb illegal sales by making Stone beers more widely available abroad once the brewery is built.

Get interesting bread. At its most elemental, bread is flour, yeast, salt and water. Get bread that has very few ingredients beyond those and it will taste better.

Molina has had plenty of opportunities to deal with other people's opinions of her. In 1976, in the wake of Argentina's military coup, she moved with her family to Paris. Molina was 12 years old.

It is not overstating the case to say that what The Lord of the Rings represents to young men, Twilight represents for young women.

No one ingredient dominates, and each plays a distinct role: Garlic gives it a little spice. The peppers add heat. The mint has a fresh sweetness. Sesame oil provides richness and fat for balance and a wonderful aroma. Pine nuts offer texture, a hint of sweetness and fats of their own. The chili powder is complex and spicy. There's salt, to banish blandness. The raw egg yolk slightly emulsifies with the oil. And the Asian pear, "the ingredient that makes it all happen," adds sweetness, acidity and freshness.

"If I had to pick a single turning point, it would be in my early 20s, right after graduate school, when I was working at a small policy think tank. I had finished everything but my dissertation for my Ph.D. in economics, and I was pretty much a policy wonk with little interest in politics. But working in a think tank made very clear to me that writing long academic policy papers only reaches a small, mostly like-minded, audience. I was drawn to the challenge of trying to communicate policy ideas to a broader audience. And that led me down a path -- at the nexus of policy and communications -- that I never would have predicted, but which has presented me with great opportunities and fascinating and rewarding work."

Located at the northern end of the developed section of the boardwalk, right on the water but pleasantly distant from its nearest neighbor, the grimy Showboat resort, Revel is enormous.

Illinois Sparkling Co. wines range from dry and citrusy to downright fruity, but all of them offer bright acidity, a hallmark of the best sparkling wines and Champagnes.

I see Missouri is facing a budget crisis and thinking about cutting services for foster care (and) for blind people. Rather than cut those human services, let's cut some things we can live without. Close permanently, if not temporarily, many of the state parks. Close all of them temporarily. Just abandon them, let them sit there; they're not going to go away. In addition, cut back on the Missouri Department of Conservation 50 percent. All the bird watching and raising elk in south Missouri could be gone. Think about the things you can live without. You can't live without food, clothing and shelter. Cut the things you don't have to have.

In fact, before they started exploring wedding styles, Bullough had never even seen her fiancé in a suit. “When I saw him in a suit, I knew that the formal style just didn’t fit,” she said. In the end, Brown wore gray pants and vest from Jos A. Bank, a gold Ralph Lauren tie and “cowboy boot-esque shoes,” while Bullough wore a silk chiffon J Crew gown, gold chunky heels, a jeweled headband created by her friend Jennifer Housman, and a Victorian agate seal necklace that had belonged to her grandmother. “Wearing my hair down was important to me,” she said, “as it reflected a natural, Bohemian look.”
Thursday, I followed him around the courthouse to witness how he managed to represent so many clients. As I wrote Friday, he works hard and he's organized. But the exercise with the Xanax case later stuck with me. In addition to his private-pay clients, Polland took court appointments in 623 cases - including 92 felonies and 190 juvenile cases. With time off for holidays and a single two-week vacation, Polland would have about three hours to devote to each case.

We inquired at several hotels in the area until we found a price we liked. The Vezir Hotel offered a cash rate of $53 a night with Wi-Fi and breakfast.

The single room had a double bed, small shower and a wooden door that still locked with an old-style key rather than a key card.

But in what was to become the beginning of the end in this country's history-altering Civil War, it took Major General William Tecumseh Sherman and his Union Army - 62,000 troops divided into two columns - more than a month to reach the sea.

"To the End of the Land," the engrossing, nearly 600-page product of such specific anguish, does not marshal any bold new arguments. Grossman's case against war is the most primitive one imaginable: He endeavors to demonstrate the cost of a single human life, in this case by underlining the miraculous set of circumstances that converge to bring a child into the world. The novel begins in a private sphere carved out of an earlier conflict, as three sickly teenagers holed up in the isolation ward of a Tel Aviv hospital comfort one another while the Six Day War of 1967 rages outside. Sitting in bed, recovering from jaundice, Ora receives a series of visits from Avram, a garrulous romantic with a vivid imagination and writerly ambitions, and Ilan, temporarily wheelchair-bound but mysterious, reserved and beautiful. This fateful meeting quickly develops into the sort of grand love triangle common to sweeping historical fiction, and although she establishes relationships with both men, Ilan is the one she marries, and Avram is relegated to the role of intimate surrogate.

POSSESSION OF DRUG ABUSE INSTRUMENTS/DISORDERLY CONDUCT, BAINBRIDGE ROAD: When a Solon man, 28, called police late on April 14 to report a suspicious vehicle in his driveway, with the driver inside holding a spoon and white powder, police followed the car up to the Tru-North station on SOM Center Road, where they made a traffic stop. A license check revealed that the driver, 39, of Shaker Heights, had a warrant out of Bainbridge Township for failure to appear, along with a notation that he might be armed and dangerous, with violent tendencies. But as he was opening the door to get out of the car, broken glass fell out of vehicle, and he said that the resident on Bainbridge Road had just smashed in his window with a baseball bat.

OZEKI: Not exactly. There was a language barrier with the Korean owner of the store, and we couldn't really go over the details in advance.

A brief moment of frisson occurred when the painting threatened to slide off one of the dollies, catching one of the crew off balance and sending him into the arms of Kropf, who propped herself against him and the crate. The moment passed quickly and the painting was slid onto the A-frame in the truck, buckled in place and on its way. The trailer part of the truck, by the way, is triple-insulated, has a massive cooling system and locks that would require an industrial blowtorch to remove. While the elaborate alarm system was going off, of course.

Still, Democrats and the Obama administration have identified a real drawback to the current system. Although average working- and middle-class taxpayers theoretically pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes than the wealthy, in practice, they often pay a larger share than many taxpayers with stratospheric incomes.

Shapiro plays at staging narratable moments to provoke spasms of notional projection, the better to expose them to a heightened pressure of self-consciousness. They instruct us in the differences between seeing them as things and seeing something in them. They do not suggest that we ought to - or could - master either capability at the expense of the other, merely that the two must be held in balance.

Christie proposes spending $8.1 billion in 2012. So spending is up, but not at the same level as before he took office, when federal money was available.
