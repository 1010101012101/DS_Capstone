It is impossible to have this list and not include one of the great female characters of all time. Of course Lena Headey isn’t nearly as impressive as Linda Hamilton in the role, but it still is a great role. The TV series focuses mostly on the Sarah that was introduced in Judgement Day, that was tough as nails and frequently kicked butt. What a fantastic, ahead of her time character. I’ll say it again, because it is worth repeating: Not as good as the movie Sarah, but the whole series was a fine adaptation of the film.

My partner wasn't all that fussed about what he got, but after using an ipad for the last 12 months I decided that I wanted an iphone. I was happy to upgrade to a basic model, but my partner decided that we needed the latest one with all the bells and whistles.

Another Pinterest find! This one I consider fully dumped in the "score!" category. It. was. awesome. What makes this recipe stand out, by far, is the "cheesy yum" (the original recipe creator's term, not mine - but isn't it fun to say? cheesy yum, cheesy yum.) at the bottom of the bowl. It really does make the soup taste like lasagna.

My husband and I planned to make the inn our afternoon coffee stop on the long trip back home from York. When we arrived, we practically had the place to ourselves. My husband and I ordered lattes, then walked through the inn, exploring all but the inaccessible caves. I couldn’t help but think of all the centuries between us and the date of the inn’s purported establishment. We found a comfortable booth in a cave room with a window and contemplated all the people who came before us, sitting, eating, drinking, talking, laughing, arguing, planning…and looking forward to doing lots and lots of killing.

A couple of weekends ago while out and about running errands I passed "our" video store and saw the "going out of business" sign. A wave a sadness washed over me. We no longer rent a lot of movies, so I suppose in some small way I have to take some responsibility for their demise. Although I suspect "Movies on Demand" (I think we have that; I can't figure it out though. We tried to order a movie once. We watched the first 30 minutes, or so, and it cut off. We got our bill and discovered we were charged three times for that movie. They were very apologetic and gave us a month upgrade with more movie channels for us not to watch.) and Netflixs have a lot to do with it.

It hardly matters what the author himself thinks of his book, but it’s worth taking a moment to dispel the notion that Heller didn’t think Something Happened as good as Catch-22. The exchange usually relied upon is between an interviewer, who asks why Heller hasn’t written anything as good as Catch-22, and Heller, who responds, “Who has?” A quip is hardly an endorsement (and I’ve been unable to find the true source; some links suggest Heller asked the question of himself in order to answer it), but anyway we know better. Heller definitely did say, “I used to think Catch-22 was my best novel until I read Kurt [Vonnegut]‘s review of Something Happened. Now I think Something Happened is.” Vonnegut’s review is a work of art in itself, so much a part of my later readings of the book that it should be published in all editions as an appendix. It’s also worth hearing what Heller himself thought about Slocum, from his Paris Review interview: “I told several people while I was writing the book that Slocum was possibly the most contemptible character in literature. Before I was finished, I began feeling sorry for him. [...M]any of my friends to whom I showed the book found not only compassion for him but strong identification.”

There was a guy named Joe in the Bible. He had another name too, but I’ll let you try and guess what that was later. Joe wasn’t a man that got a lot of attention or accolades but without him a lot of things would have been very, very different. Joe was one of those guys who didn’t seek the limelight, and never really wanted to be the guy up front, but was very wise and talented. He was of particular help to another guy who really did do incredible things, and I think if that guy were standing before us now he would likely say that without God really using our hero Joe, he may never have accomplished what he did. Joe’s best quality was the he was an encourager. The word “encourager” comes from combing the word “in” with the word “courage”, in essence saying “put courage into another”. He was one of those people who could see the best in those around him, knew that everyone had something great to offer, and was not shy about standing up for them with other people. When people looked at others and saw the bad, Joe knew how to both see and extract the good. Wow – what a trait to have. Which person do you want to be, the discourager, or the encourager? Not a hard question to answer is it, but in spite of that, we spend a lot of our time being discouraged, AND discouraging. We really should seek to be more like Joe shouldn’t we?

Summary: Tom Stein is your average Hollywood junior agent; he has a few B-list clients, most of whom are difficult to work with and worth far less than they think they are and one star (Michelle Beck) who he is only representing by way of luck. That is, until his boss at Lupo Associates, Carl Lupo, asks for a favor he will never forget. Tom is to represent a potentially world-changing alien race called the Yherajk who contacted Carl because of his influence in Hollywood. However, these aren’t the little green men Carl has made millions portraying, the Yherajk are essentially a glob of stinking goo and therefore not a desirable image in the minds of the world. Tom must figure out a way to essentially create a Trojan Horse as a vehicle to introduce the Yherajk to society. Joshua, the Yherajk sent down to interact with Tom is a humorous, often crude character who is able to inhabit different being’s bodies, a skill that will come in handy in Tom’s adventure with the Yherajk. Tom must do all this while handling his demanding list of clients, battling a reporter out to dig up dirt on him, and other agents vying for his business. Fortunately, Tom has the help of his witty assistant Miranda and the only other human who knows about the Yherajk, his boss Carl.

Covering up the attempted murder of a Russian oligarch on a London street is undesirable from every point of view. And the worst of it is that it inevitably engenders the suspicion that there are other cover-ups, other important stories being withheld from the media.

The entire appointment was a bit surreal for me and I’m not actually sure how I maintained any composure because all I really wanted to do after hearing that news was burst into tears. I knew that wasn’t going to get us anywhere so I tried to keep asking questions to use our time wisely and postpone the emotions until we had more privacy. I did NOT want to be sent home in tears feeling like I didn’t know anything new. Information is comfort to me so we pressed on. We’re not sure what we’re going to do yet but I needed to know enough to feel like we were able to make a rational decision and not just an emotional one or like we were grasping at straws. I even pushed the issue a little more of trying fertility drugs with our current method and the doctor completely denied it again. I guess it was just really hard for me to let go of that because I was 110% sure that was going to be our next step.
But when I started to think about it more, I decided I’m not totally on board with the idea. For starters, a woman who is a dedicated runner could have a BMI below 18.5 and still be considered healthy. Now, it’s not likely that a marathon runner is going to want to be a model, but you never know. If this law was passed to promote health in Israel’s models and citizens, then maybe more attention should be focused on the condition of the models’ bodies rather than their weight. A chain smoker could be overweight and extremely unhealthy, whereas an avid marathon runner who eats well could be underweight by this standard, but still healthy. Yet only the former would be allowed to model in Israel.
Yet this is not the first time that the Boers are facing such an ethnic cleansing campaign by a nation which is hell-bent to remove their very rights to exist in South Africa - this is actually already the third time in Boer history.

In the business sector issues of race, coupled with unequal pay and corporate crime continue to hamper our economic growth. When you see things like this you wish that the government spent less time trying to muzzle the media and the Opposition, (and making stupid tasteless jokes a la Roodal Moonilal) and focus on actually running the country efficiently….but that would require having a plan that’s broader and more complex than draining the treasury, wouldn’t it?
The resulting prosecution is a depressing display of abuse of government authority. It’s hard to comprehensively catalog all of the lawless aspects of the US government’s prosecution of Megaupload, so I’ll just focus on two:

I'm taking Heidi's ashes and we're getting our own Urn and you can be in your own box by yourself."
Life's rhythms go on. Most of the things that I considered important when I was 18 just aren't anymore. In fact, even five years ago, I was a totally different person. I remember how my 80-year-old grandmother used to laugh at things that I would say, responding "darlin', none of that grows a garden".

The question that everyone needs ask to is: Is it possible to centrally plan a highly complex national economy? To plan an economy, a government economic czar needs to posses omnipotence in order to cover and understand all aspects, areas, and units of a large-scale economy. He needs to consider crucial issues related to wealth-creation and economic gains, such as the primary source of wealth, how this wealth is created, the role of producers or manufacturers, the role of consumers, the importance of a stable currency, the factors of global trade, among others. However, the most important question of all is: Who creates wealth? Is it the government or the private individuals?

Could you argue that the sheep doesn’t know about his fate and therefore this is a harmless trick? Yes, you could, but I think that a guillotine is not a normal sort of environment for that sheep and that it must feel, if not fear, at least discomfort in his surroundings. There are reasons why we don’t run certain scientific experiments on people, even if the results might be astoundingly significant or even beneficent. We should evaluate what we do as “performance” art in a similar manner. Crossing a boundary is one thing. But crossing every boundary is not necessary or desirable. It’s cheap trickery at best.

Instead they elect a bunch of farm managers for their problem farm, and blame the farm managers that there is not enough milk (for their pity me parties), or too much cow dung (crime). Most farm managers go along with this farming slavery plantation charade, because the slavery and cannon fodder plantation farming system has evolved to the point that nobody appointed to farm manager positions can in fact solve any of the problems. The good one’s do their best to mitigate the symptoms; and the corrupt ones just exploit their status as farm manager.

While in FT Lauderdale a few weeks ago for Fleet Week, I had the privilege to visit USCGC BERNARD C. WEBBER (WPC 1101) and spend some time onboard with her crew. BERNARD C. WEBBER is the first of the Coast Guard's new Sentinel-class cutters, a true 21st century patrol boat class that brings a significant increase in capability. She is 154 feet long, capable of speeds of 28 plus knots, armed with one stabilized, remotely-operated 25mm chain gun and four crew-served .50 caliber machine guns, holds up to 24 crew and can independently deploy up to five days. The increase in size, speed and crew capability gives this class of ship a significant advantage over her predecessor, the 110-foot Island-class cutter.
The night before I had joked “any time I decide to bring in munchkins, somebody else brings in a wafflemaker”. I can’t keep up with the thoughtfulness of most people.

Kind of, although mine turned way better than the pictures! The pattern envelope photos and illustrations also don’t really show how A-line this garment actually is.

He's a happy boy, full of energy, and loves his father so much. It gives a sort of balance to the story, Ronnie hating his father, and Jonah loving and enjoying every minute he spends with his dad. If the case is they both hate their father, I think the story would be so hard to endure.

As is readily seen, the advantages of Zinc in the body, both in how it is necessary to fight and prevent acne and due to it being active in maintaining a healthy immune system, are numerous.

A smaller scale example of this phenomenon would be Swedish 'Primtives-meets-Ramones' band, The Dahlmans cover of "I Love You Baby (But I Hate Your Friends)". The song, written by Andy Shernoff of The Dictators first appeared (I think...) on a 2006 album by Kitty and the Kowalskis (which I head about here). It's a pretty solid album but that song just leaps out and infects your brain. So, while The Dahlans, who have superb taste in covers, may not make this song a pop sensation, making it as the A-side of a single helps bring the unknown to light.

There are too many cameos in this crazy movie for me to tag and list here… It’s a veritable Who’s Who of past Kevin Smith films. A reunion of sorts. Written as a promise to pal Jason Mewes (after the actor went to rehab and got clean), Smith’s reunion movie pulls out all the stops. They even dig up Morris Day & the Time for the grand finale.

Playground by 50 Cent. The usual growling prejudice against celebrities who decide to write children's books had to be suspended for this one, because I loved it. This is despite it being a 'therapy' book, which is a device I usually don't like. It's the story of Butterball, who starts off as an unpleasant bully who has violently attacked another boy. Without excusing or ignoring what he'd done, the reader gradually comes to hope for Butterball's redemption - something that seems impossible at the beginning when he's full of incoherent swagger. I was fascinated by the US setting - paying for your own social worker? Paying for private school if you're expelled from state school? - a long way from the anodyne view of American life served up by Disney Channel.The healing relationship between Butterball and his cousellor was truly moving, and might help readers understand what is missing in their own lives. I could not stop reading until I had found out Butterball's secrets.

2) Its only reasonably precise meaning is also its most useless: it can mean “massage that reaches under the superficial muscles to reach tissues underneath.” All massage does this, of course; there's virtually no way to avoid it. And all competent massage therapists, however they advertise themselves, know how to move the body around so as to get better access to deeper muscles. A massage therapist who won't do this, who just pets an immobile body with a uniform light pressure, won't last a week. Even the supposedly fluffy relaxation therapists do this. Some are more aggressive than others, but they all do it.

Prepare linguine as instructed on the box, and in another pot add enough water to cover onion, garlic, and peas. Cook until peas are bright green, drain, puree and then add pesto (make your own or buy fresh pesto at the store). When the linguine is done, mix pea/pesto together and add some water to thin it out. Sprinkle salt and pepper and parm cheese and enjoy.

The concept of habitat as a locale whose characteristics conduce to the flourishing of particular species can be extended into the realm of abstractions. If a particular set of ideas must be established for persons whose livelihood depends on the widespread acceptance of those ideas to flourish, those ideas constitute a non-geographic sort of habitat: an ideological foundation which, when established among a populace, will permit persons whose ambitions they favor to rise in prosperity, prestige, and influence.

Kendall is another strong player in this story, the trailer park girl who moved up to the rich part of town. She and Seth have known each other almost their whole lives and have a surprising history between them. Kendall is a mess, but also has a beautiful strength to her that resonates throughout. For every mistake she makes, Kendall seems to come back swinging to make up for it in even bigger ways, and I completely adored the way she and Seth interacted. Some of the most intense, stunning moments of the book were between these two.

As usual by the author, Arthur Hailey, this book is a combination of perfect research, lots of details and a gripping story on automobile industry. He has not written too many books but whatever he has written can provide you inside out information about a particular industry. “Wheels” as the name suggests does the same for automobile industry specifically dealing with the mass production of cars and how it affects the industry as well as people who live in these cities.

My friend would send me something that he heard and/or read about, and was as amazed as I was. Because of the timeliness, he encouraged me to not only write my script, but to also write a novel. At first I said “no way,” I can’t write a novel, especially when I am preparing to write a 100-plus page script. But as the outline grew, and my note cards multiplied, I realized there is a novel contained in my story.

Yeah, yeah. Let’s get down off our high horses for a moment and recall that this is exactly the advice that most moms give their teenagers at some point or another (ever been told your friends were having a “bad influence”? or gotten the “You are who your friends are” lecture?

And it doesn’t always have to do with any sticky class or racial prejudices–getting ahead is the sort of thing that ‘Murricans worry about, like, all the time.

I sat down with Cookie to make sure she knew her own mind. As I suspected, she knows it rather well. She loves music and takes lessons. She sings in a choir. I occasionally have to separate her from her ipod so her brain can rejoin the family. She is always singing. She chooses her music and she chooses great stuff. I showed her Beyonce so that she would know. I showed her Beyonce's lyrics. I told her that we have never talked about Beyonce because we have never really thought about Beyonce... or Jay-z or Rihanna or Brittany Spears or a thousand other cultural idols. I told her it's not about keeping fun out of the house... but keeping beauty and goodness alive. The kids listen to what the Chief and I listen to so this is not hypocrisy. And she understood everything before I even said a word. The discussion wasn't particularly necessary although I think she appreciated the time I took to make sure.
I’m scared Voluntary work will suffer greatly when the introduction of all the activities mentioned above takes place. Vital local and mostly charitable services, such as support for the disabled, local youth football teams or even just a friendly ear and a hot cup of coffee may have to face the stigma of having “perverse” single parents volunteering with them, or “feckless” benefit bums working with them, all because of the stigma attached to the WP. Services may have to be reduced and costs cut back even more as people may start thinking “Well, they’ll get the people on the dole to do it, i don’t need to”.

If creating art is not your thing then try making photo collages using Shape Collage, Microsoft AutoCollage or Andrea Mosaic. Microsoft AutoCollage definitely has a big ‘wow factor’ but Shape Collage does offer more control over their finished collage as it allowed them to choose a background colour, border colour, shape and overlap. Andrea Mosaic is a different sort of thing entirely and some might think it needs too much effort as you need a large selection of images to get a good result. The resulting creations have a big impact though.

I just truly wonder why the stories of what racist politicians are saying is not demonstrated to the world! I also wonder why it's not common knowledge how tens upon thousands of South Africans feel so threatened that they've placed refugee applications into foreign embassies, awaiting, begging and pleading to be allowed out of this racism mess that the ANC seem so beset on creating. What would be great is to see demonstrations like never see before to voice the cry of anguished people living under a Neo-Nazi threat, this time only reversed, here in Africa.

About 10 years ago, I was in a barn show in Westminster MD with Say Anything (not the wimpy emo band), Innerside Burning (hxc), Element 101, Hangnail and The Undecided. As I was browsing the merch table, I notice 2 compilations. This one, and Happy Christmas volume 2 on BEC recordings. I wasnt sure about this comp, so I bought happy christmas because BEC and Tooth & Nail were putting out some awesome pop punk at the time. The x-mas comp had only 1 good song on it (MxPx - Christmas Day). So I was a bit bummed out. Wishing I would have bought the Going Nowhere Fast compilation just for the MxPx and Element 101 songs.

We reached the same camping knoll we stayed at a couple of days earlier. This time, however, it was occupied by the park rangers on their whatever mission. Likely there was another spot right next door. One of the park ranges, as soon as he saw our group, came over to talk. I suppose they don’t really see large groups like that often.
I would have felt particularly offended by this final humiliation if it wasn’t for what happened next. It is perhaps best not to describe it in too much detail, though, needless to say, the best efforts of Terry Nutkins and three firemen couldn’t stop Patrick from finally fulfilling his intentions in a way that was beautiful to see. After two minutes, I left the commotion behind me in order to find Judy, who placed a rather respectable fourteenth.

Prediction? Looking at all the games and based only on last season, worst case scenario, 11-5. Realistically it’ll be more like 13-3.

In 1994, I was a new, middle-aged American bride living in my husband’s home of Cote d’Ivoire. I had arrived in August and by November I was student at the University of Abidjan’s French language program for non-French speakers. At that time, Liberia’s civil war was in full rage and many Liberians had taken refuge in Abidjan. Some were lucky enough to receive United Nations scholarships which enabled them to take French language courses at the University of Abidjan as well. They became my peers, my friends and my refuge from the callousness of Francophones. They were also my point of entry into Liberian history, Liberian-American history, factional fighting, changing alliances and the delicious joy of rice with palava sauce.

There's a larger issue here, of course, and that's the fact that nothing is really private on the Internet. Just as job-hunting college students have found themselves embarrassed when potential employers discover their MySpace pages, writers need to remember that blog entries, message board posts, and Usenet participation are public discourse. If you take responsibility for your words, and say nothing online that you aren't willing for everyone in the world to see--including the agent you queried last week--you won't need to worry about who's doing a websearch on you, or what they might learn.
Resettlement and closure led to retraction of wards and services back into the main building, with the areas to the north closing first.

I was not aware until later that this was merely a detail from a small piece by Italian Renaissance painter Andrea Mantegna. This is, in fact, a sleeping Joseph, while the rest of the painting depicts Mary, baby Jesus and, you know, the adoring shepards. Interestingly, our discussion of this seems to have been hampered by our lack of that information. The children identified the man as sad and we spent several minutes proposing our ideas for why he might be sad, but without anything else to go on, the discussion, quite rightly, fell flat.

More Haitians live in Miami than anywhere else in America. Their presence does not seem to please Miami’s Cubans or even its blacks. Last year a black activist tried to prevent government funds earmarked for “African-Americans” from being shared by Haitians. This angered Haitians, who reminded Miami’s blacks that Haitians will soon outnumber them. This may not be pleasant. A letter to a Miami newspaper from a newcomer suggests relations are not good: “My experience as a Haitian-American with African-American schoolmates was one filled with racial epithets such as H.B.O. (Haitian body odor), Haitians eat cats, Haitians are boat people, and Haitians have AIDS. These African-American kids were taught at home to despise Haitians.”

Well, the new EP consists of 5 re-imagined versions of tracks that appeared on the demo. The goal was to create and deliver a more energetic and vivid experience and I think I was able to accomplish that with this record. It also serves as a good indication of the direction I’m heading in with future productions. I had a lot of fun working on this project and I truly hope the fans enjoy it as much as I did putting it together.”

Not to mention the fact that I was giving the eulogy at Dad's funeral, so I had pretty much cut myself off from feeling. I was my mother's rock; I made call after call to family and close friends the entire day after my father passed. (That Friday was the worst day of my life thus far and that is not being melodramatic. It really was.) I organized food (thank God for Facebook; I don't know how I would have gotten through the week without it!) and made sure that the arrangements were appropriate. I performed my duties thoroughly, without qualms or regrets.

Kelly green is also a great color for the latest shoes this season. You can find it in Yoki’s new spring-summer line. Try the color out in the new “Brenda” style, which is a flat sandal adorned with an adorable bow. Or if you want to be over-the-top trendy, invest in the “Mogan” style – a thick heeled platform shoe incorporating both Kelly green and yellow. Two trends for the price of one!

A few times I’ve mentioned something I call the Great Realignment, but I thought I’d discuss it again in light of the French election results. The Great Realignment is a process I believe is underway across all of western Europe. European politics is realigning along the axis of receptivity or resistance to the triple threat of Islam/Immigration/EU.

But all jokes aside… the fact that we as the American people have been slowly manipulated into consistently buying foreign, cheaply made, disposable (to ensure repurchase) products is a most heinous consumerist conspiracy, whether is was intentional or not (and it was intentional), it is and has been slowly destroying the economy and the manufacturing and production value of our entire nation. And at this point, that value and pride of production is almost completely vanished. A whole generation is now being brought up thinking that this is somehow normal and acceptable. And these same kids will grow up with their only job options being in the service industry. Bankers, customer service, check-out clerks, police, government, forced volunteerism (Obama-corps)… or in other support functions such as IT, computer software, computer programmer, technical support, or any number of non-producing, non-relevant jobs. And as the products they continue to blindly purchase from increasingly less quality sources become more poisonous and more disposable, they wont have any frame of reference to compare their way of life and their consumerism to in order to save their own economic viability and for that matter, their humanity.
Hard-core Trekkies may remember that The Motion Picture received a similar treatment (and when I say ‘hard-core’ I mean the only group of people who would be willing to sit through “The Slow-Motion Picture” twice in one lifetime) and of course, we all remember the Star Wars Special Editions and Blade Runner make-overs. Their success has led us to now expect the old cheesy special effects to have been replaced by new computer generated ones every time an old series or movie is re-released.

I have a hard time thinking through God answering a prayer for me. I’m not someone who easily accepts the idea of God’s love for me (yes, I know – odd for a minister). Even more so in what can be a very isolating job as a minister. So today, I have been attempting to ‘try on’* the idea that God reached across the veil with this silly little cat to let me know God loves me. It is a small token to remind me that God still loves me, even amidst all else that is going on in the world.
That’s too simple.

It is also true that the possibility that Congress will again fail to provide funds for the operation of the government is a remote possibility. But there is no harm in providing for all the possibilities, both near and remote. If that remote possibility never comes, well and good, nothing is lost and the situation is saved. However, if the remote possibility does come, and it is not impossible, and we had already nullified the executive order on appropriation, how will the government function and survive? On the other hand, if we defer judgment upon the nullity of such executive order, and that remote possibility does come, we still have the saving lifeline of that executive order which may, perhaps, be tolerated to save the country from chaos, until a more proper and adequate remedy can be secured.

Prince Maximillian Franz was also aware of Beethoven music and so he sent Beethoven to Vienna, in 1787, to meet Mozart and the further his musical education. Vienna was, after all, the beacon city in terms of culture and music. There exist only texts of disputable authenticity on the subject of this meeting between Mozart and Beethoven. Mozart is thought to have said “don’t forget his name – you will hear it spoken often!”
We both had to get back to work Monday morning, and I was asked numerous times if I had been drunk the whole day of the wedding. While I can’t deny that I had my share of drinks at the reception, at no point was I intoxicated. I was just intoxingly happy. And so was Dave. And it was WONDERFUL.If you’ve read previous posts, I’ve probably got you concerned right now, thinking something like… “WHAT!? She’s pregnant and she was DRINKING!?!” Unfortunately, that was another change since the last time I posted.

Speaking to the Guardian, Nikahang Kowsar, a prominent Iranian cartoonist who fell foul of the Iranian regime after famously caricaturing a prominent cleric like a crocodile in a series of cartoons, said: “This verdict is a direct threat to each and every cartoonist working inside Iran. From now on, if this sentence is not set aside, any public official could sue the cartoonists for portraying him/her in a cartoon.”

Once my legs could bear it no more I came back inside. We call the website we ordered from which is a middle man for tons of restaurants in Denmark (http://www.just-eat.dk). They have live chat support and thankfully we got someone who did speak English. They called the restaurant then explained they had left the food outside, by our camping van…but we don’t have a camping van. So the middleman phones the restaurant back and they agree to send out a new order of food.

So, how do you begin? As with everything else, begin with broad strokes and then fill in the details later. You might begin by making a list of the major people groups in your world, or in a portion of it (this is how I started creating the world of Avnul). Or, you might begin by drawing maps, or even doodling and deciding later that your doodles are maps (this is how Orson Scott Card began building one of his worlds). You might start by listing out the major political powers in your world, and how they relate to one another (I’m in the middle of doing this now for a new story that I want to write someday). Wherever you start, begin with this in mind: Good world-building takes time. If you only want a big enough world to write a two-thousand word story, then it might only take a few weeks or a month – maybe you only need a city, or even just part of a city. However, a complete world can take years to write. It must grow, evolve, and become a creature and a character all it’s own. I don’t plan to write anything longer than flash fiction in the world I just started for at least two years.

Father Christmas’ connection with reindeer harks back to ancient times when the Winter King was a symbol of masculine natural energy, embodied in the stag and other horned animals. His reindeer are replacements for Odin’s eight-legged horse Sleipnir. Magic is obviously an integral part of the legend and enables Father Christmas to deliver gifts to all children around the world on Christmas Eve!

Now we’re hearing that the action has shifted to Koulouba and the presidential palace, where mutineers may be confronting the presidential guard. Fortunately RFI (French radio) is still in business; around 10 p.m. it reports fighting and possibly flames in the vicinity of the palace. It’s unclear whether this is simply a “misunderstanding among brothers-in-arms,” as some of the mutineers earlier claimed, or an out-and-out coup attempt.

The hardest thing to explain to someone who’s never performed is how much you have to feel. How you aren’t just showing others what it’s like to feel what you do or be where you were, but creating enough of that emotion that it reaches out and touches them. I don’t get up on stage and sing for me – I sing and feel and exert energy for every person in that room. In order to do that, to put so much into five or fifteen or forty five minutes, I have to believe that it’s worth it. I have to blindly invest every bit of my heart and my energy and my faith in the fact that what I am doing matters to someone, because 99% of the time, nobody else is going to tell me that it does. I don’t get a score or a grade or even a response sometimes. I just have to turn my face upwards and believe that they are listening, even when I can’t see them.

It's always good to add some sparkle. This is a collection that I've created for my clients over the years of gold pinecones, berries and eucalyptus. The pinecones typically come on large sticks which are too long to use at the top of the tree.

Another key factor is to roast at a high temperature so that the veggies caramelize and become sweet. Also, make sure that they are well spread out on the baking sheet. You want all sides of the vegetable to be exposed to the heat so that they brown nicely. Otherwise, if they are too cramped together, they tend to steam, & get mushy, rather than roast. Not that that has ever happened to me, mind you…

I have to say, right off the bat this book intrigued me. Duff. I'd never heard the word before but after learning it's meaning, it is definitely something that I could see myself, and many other teen girls (and boys) relating too. Besides that though, the plot sounded really good so after hearing some positive buzz about the book, I decided to pull it from my bookshelf and read it.

As a “rouge” from California, I expected a drinkable red table wine dominated by the vegetal flavor of zinfandel grapes and that’s exactly what I got.

There are other reasons to not walk the streets. One it’s stinking hot, two it’s dirty & dusty, and three the pollution levels are suffocating. That’s not to say it’s not livable. You can quite literally build your own climate-controlled castle here, have a live in maid to cook, clean & wash, and your own personal chauffeur to drive your two cars between home, work and shopping mall. You only have to be middle class, with a steady job and a willingness to live in a “bubble”. I’m starting to think it might be nice to live here someday. Maybe when I retire. Everything is cheaper here and of course it’s nice having relatives nearby. After ten years abroad you tend to be quite out of touch with the joys of family.

As for how I danced, from what I felt like, there was a 50/50 good-bad ratio through out what seemed to be endless heats. The early heats were rough for me, fear, nerves and sheer terror, took its tool. My legs were shaking so much I stumbled on the easiest of moves. I was taking my victories where I could, remembering the saying about when you go on the competition floor you only keep half of the dance you have in practice and thinking I’d only kept about 25%.

I was curious about the farm, and on the mini tour to view the pheasants and Mad March Hares, I asked a lot of questions. The farm had both livestock (cows and sheep, for meat though not for milk – no Eau de Dairy Farm here) and arable crops, and having been told this, I opened my mouth to ask a question about the cows – only to be corrected before I’d even finished my sentence. Another countryside lesson: while colloquially the term ‘cows’ is used in general to refer to cattle, in Farm World calling a beast a ‘cow’ implies that the beast is female, and has had calves. ‘Heifer’ is the term for a female cow before she has had any calves. A bull is an “intact male bovine animal” while ‘bullock’ refers to a less fortunate male, who has been castrated. The cows (colloquial use) on this farm were all bulls, being farmed for beef. I have to say, I never thought I would know this much about cows (again, colloquial use), and I’m still not sure it will ever be useful, but for now it will become yet another part of my country disguise, so that people think I know what I’m talking about.

Sun Up Brewing’s Nut Before Christmas Nut Brown Ale is, sadly, uninspiring. I tried their Vanilla Porter earlier this year and liked it very much, but this limited edition is best left alone. There is no discernible flavor up front and just a tiny hint of sweet nuttiness in the finish. I’ve been left wishing I’d gotten a jug of their IPA instead.
At twilight we stopped by the side of the road and she took off like a bird into the dusk, stopping to collect rocks and sticks and build sculptures with no need of any interaction from us.

An offensive slogan was being posted on walls before and during the election,” If you want a N***** for a neighbour, vote Labour”. Harold Wilson attributed this to Griffiths on national Television, when asked by Robin Day on Panorama of 9th March 1964 . Mr. Wilson replied, that he understood that this was said by the Conservative candidate in Smethwick. Griffiths denied he or any member of the Conservative party had used this slogan, but did refuse to condemn its use saying it was an expression of frustration felt by local people at being ignored by their representatives. He explained that the only person who had heard it was Mr.Walker, who claimed it was in use in the Municipal elections of 1963. A Labour spokesman said that Wilson had said no more than was in the morning’s Times. Mr.Griffiths threatened to sue Mr.Wilson but later declined. After the Election new Prime Minister Wilson broke from his address on the Queens speech to insult Griffiths by calling him a “Parliamentary Leper”, who would be shunned by everyone in the House. This breached the convention that new members be protected until after their Maiden speech! Harold Gurden Birmingham Conservative mp (Selly Oak) told the Times 25/1/1965, “He “had not met Griffiths but would be his friend in the House.” Then on October the 5th 1964 just two weeks before polling Griffiths was denounced for his campaign in the Birmingham Post and the Times Midland correspondent wrote, ”It is abhorrent to all Conservatives candidates and officials of stature to whom I have talked.” The column of October the 12th, “Vile –its all in Black and White.”As the election result was announced on October the 16th Socialists made Nazi salutes. Mr.Walker, the embittered loser griped,” I feel the result tonight will give Smethwick a bad name.” The Bishop of Southwark called the electorate “unchristian” and the Bishop of Chelmsford and Archbishop of Canterbury also condemned them but that local people supporting a local-born candidate in a democratic election over a local issue is a model of Democracy at work yet, these un-elected Bishops who lived far away, were imposing their a priori ideology on the situation but not drawing inferences from the facts or observation.
Chapter 2 of Liquids and Gasses has lots of fun water experiments. Because the weather was not conducive to being in it, we used the bathtub. We punched holes in a milk jug and watched the water shoot out father from the bottom hole than the top hole. We also poked a hole in the bottom of one cup and the side of another to demonstrate that pressure is in all directions. I thought this would be rather simplistic, but I underestimated boys' fascination with water.
As the data plainly indicate, Rome knew how to create wealth. And, despite the fact that Roman soldiers had little qualms about inflicting pain, I would also argue they showed more compassion during their crucifixions than the EPA does during theirs.
The way the MWA, WF and WP works, you get little say in the type of thing you’ll be doing, however, when you make your own conscious choice to volunteer in a place that interests you and makes you feel like you’ve accomplished something, then, my friends, i have nothing but praise and a sense that there is hope for humanity. Volunteering shouldn’t be seen as work, in my opinion. Volunteering should be seen as helping your local community, you’re providing a service, for free, using your own time and energy to ultimately make someone or a group of people’s lives better.
The suite business offers big profits, and has been the impetus for numerous sports franchises to seek sleek new facilities.
First, I cut my 4' board into 1' pieces (Okay, I had my husband cut them for me with his circular saw...I am not to be trusted with sharp objects). I spray painted them, let them dry, and then drilled a hold in each corner of one piece.
THERE is a class of prosy gentlemen whom the inexorable fates decree that we should meet sometimes at the corner of a street on a windy day, who come between us and the object of our affections at a botanical fete, and hold us metaphorically by the button on every inconvenient occasion, to tell us something which we have heard a hundred times before, or retail one of those remarkable adventures in which the chief characteristic is the constant recurrence of the first personal pronoun.
Smile and wave. That really pisses them off.
First though, I had to wait a week whilst John made me a leather carcass for the scissor case. John has past experience of Andy’s sharp things, as many of his leatherworking tools were also made by Andy, so he was wary enough of the pointy to use his thickest sole leather for the case so that the tip of the scissors would have a harder time piercing the end of the case.

It’s the Tuesday after our first men’s conference for 2012, and I’m still excited! By God’s grace, more than 1,000 men experienced the presence of God’s Spirit in a very masculine way. Let me describe what happened. Most of all, I will pass along direct quotes from others who were impacted by the Promise Keepers (PK) 2012 “Called Out” men’s conference.
Jeremy Crawford: There is a tremendous amount of world texture that we can include when there isn't pressure to make everything count in every single combat encounter.

The night We arrived Anne and the other Ladies met us for a get to know you meal , as it turned out I had met two of the women in Kentucky at MMM a couple years ago and Debby is an old friend from Doll club here in NJ ..It is always good to make new friends and spend time with old friends Too . On the first day of the workshop Anne gave each one of us a beautiful Beaded bracelet that she made, how cool is that ! It has inspired me to learn how to bead ! but that is for another Blog .. Anne is a Talented and generous lady I'm so happy to know her .

Here are some indicators. Sea levels were rising about 3mm a year until last year; this would have lead to an increase of 270mm by the end of the 21st century; since last year, however, they have dropped. Since satellite measurements began in 1978, the Antarctic has been getting colder and its ice increasing. Since 1978, the Arctic ice decreased until 2007, and has recovered somewhat since then; open water at the North Pole happened throughout the 20th century; I have a picture of the US submarine Skate in open water at the North Pole in March 1959.

I thought a few mins and basically told him what I was gonna do, but it was game over without doing it. I would give the Kodiak 1 focus to make a simple push. Even if I rolled a 1 and he rolled a 6 on the STR check, the immortal infantry guy was gonna be pushed 1 inch away, no longer contesting the flag. Then my 2 remaining Demo Corps would score on one flag and Irusk would just run btb with the other one to score the 3rd remaining point. I love playing tactical scenarios and specially incursion, so I was glad with the victory.
I'll be coming around sooner or later. And I'll still be writing. I'll be a whole writer again. With friends. Deal? Deal.
Yet another of the day’s many unexpected sights was a giant squad of police decked out in riot gear outside our destination – the Rodin museum. It was very strange – people walking dogs, tourists, families with strollers were all allowed to enter the street without any problems – but clearly something was going on, or about to begin. The whole scene was a little disconcerting. These white vans filled with policemen lined the entire block, all the way to the end.

“I decided that after my day, I had earned a night at the inn. I ate my dinner and had a few drinks in the common room before sitting down in my room to read ‘The Cabin in the Woods’. Finally, I put the book away and wrote all of this down. Now, it is time to turn in for the night. I am absolutely exhausted, but it is the fatigue of a day of proud work.

D was a bit reluctant about going to school today but the chilly school run had her almost rushing into the classroom. She blamed me for being cold so there was no goodbye hug, nothing! Thanks D! At least she was in, I guess.
I am frustrated, disappointed and getting to the point of being pissed off. I want to not feel like my time is a waste. I just want something for participating. For trying. I am not looking for a lot here, I know this. I have heard others vent the same.
Sorry, I'm coughing..LOL
I got a chilly surprise as it tumbled down dripping everywhere.
(Viewers can see the policemen’s responses in the sub-titled video on a loop at the exhibition. “You use the word ‘crossfire’ with the picture of a paddy field at night and everyone knows that’s where it happened,” says one. “The image gives the impression of a place we may take them to do our work.”)
Sometime in the near future I hope to move my blog to a new website. It will still be through blogger, but the web address will be different, and it will have a new title (we're not Triplets plus 1 anymore!) That and I get so many weird spam comments through this blog and I'm ready for a fresh start. I'll post the details whenever I make the move! (This blog will still be here at this address, I'll just be starting a new one at a different address)
My absolute favorite meals are the ones I get to have with close friends and family. I don’t really care whether it’s 100% paleo or not. As soon as Halloween is over people start putting up Christmas lights and buying Christmas presents and it makes me sick. Thanksgiving just kind of gets swept under the rug.
Hope you're have some fun plans??? I'm taking my middle daughter to Savannah for some shopping. Rebecca grew quite a bit this summer..and her feet grew from a shoe size 5 to a 7 1/2....crazy huh??? Anyway, Savannah here we come!!!
One buwaa had discovered a family of owls living in the nearby jungle. The half-dozen buwaas working on the TCC immediately dropped everything, ran one of their number up a 15-meter log, and safely returned him with a precious cargo of three baby owls. The owls, DBD explained, would fetch 100,000 rupees apiece in the Kathmandu – three of them would bring in almost exactly the amount needed to pay off TCC-related debts.
Last month, Madison started dance!!!! I have been so excited about this since I found out I was having a girl. I think we started her at the perfect time. She is typically very shy but has recently started breaking out of her shell.
I waited with Dad, we were third in line at the cash register while he fished in his green work pants for money to pay for our things and I didn’t even feel like everyone was staring at us oddly. Having your period has always been as natural to me as brushing your teeth every day or bathing. It’s just something you do and you have to take care of your body.
But it’s nice to see people start blogging who actually take right to it. Like Dawn! I feel a bit bad that I keep forgetting to make a post about your blog… SO here I am now. Posting about your blog.
Lightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Combine flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl, stirring with a whisk. Combine banana and next 5 ingredients (banana through egg) in a bowl; beat with a mixer at medium speed for 1 minute or until well blended. Add flour mixture to banana mixture, and beat until blended. Pour batter into prepared pan.

Impartiality requires a Councillor to actively seek out and weigh the relevant arguments on any issue and to present them fairly and without personal bias. It means listening to both side of any argument and both points of view. It involves actively seeking out the broadest breadth of view.
Today I decided to sleep in and avoid the cold - which forced me to go to the gym to get my run in for the free childcare...... see this year, NO EXCUSES! I felt great today and took it easy. I was huffing and puffing on Tuesday, less on Thursday and almost not at all today until I was at 2.4 miles.

I was on another such call recently, the purpose of which—according to the Jewish rabbinical group that invited me—was to help listeners “understand the current state of the economy; learn about the impact of the proposed budget cuts on the poor and disenfranchised; consider the consequences of the increasing gap between the rich and poor in America; and, glean homiletic and textual background to help prepare their High Holiday sermons on this timely topic.”

“This really gives producers the potential to radically alter their business model, and conceivably be able to see many more people in the same period of time,” Kerzner said. “Likewise, if carriers can get better at actually completing business online, so those producers could get apps in real-time, working online with a consumer makes more sense.”

Even after six months in the lower class, Hyemi, Samdong, and Pilsook are not being granted the opportunity to join the performing arts class. But they aren't the only ones with school woes--the students in the idol group "K" have been absent too often and the principal will only let them pass if they participate in the Dance of the Year competition. Um. Okey-dokey, Mr. Principal, sir. It's not like they should be made to attend summer school or write essays or anything crazy like that. Dance-offs it is! The lower class kids will be competing to gain enough points to get into the upper class next year--all they have to do is win third place, but of course Hyemi wants to aim for first if she can get it.

By contrast Germany has a two-tier approach to photographic protection. A mere “photograph” i.e. any old photo with no creativity or artistic quality is treated as a “relative right” and protected for 50 years from the date of publication. The title of “photographic work” is awarded to “personal intellectual creations” which are similar to the French original photographs (angle, focus, colour etc are all important in this assessment).
For this week's challenge, "Love is in the Air" #97, we were asked to make a project with a heart on it. Some of us were also lucky enough to use some of our FABULOUS sponsor's stamp...who is our sponsor you ask, the one and only K. Andrew Designs Stamps. I just LOVE all of her stamp sets and had so much fun playing with this set.
Pretty cheery 'After' view now, eh? (Sorry, prepping myself for our trip this weekend!) And doesn't the Windsor chair look so pretty white? I prefer honey on my yogurt, not my wood grain. The other three chairs will be white, too. Someday.

In my youth, my muse was full of passion and possibility. It was a voice of idealism. It was a voice craving for life, all of it. It was the part of me that thirsted for all that life had to offer. It was the voice of my deepest longings and my greatest hopes.
So last month I told you all that I was working on an 1890's cycling costume for our DFWCG Steampunk Tea Party. Well... life got in the way, and that outfit didn't get finished in time, so I've put it on hold until our train ride outing in May. I ended up digging though my closet and settling for a hodgepodge, thrown-together, last minute costume. It's a very typical steampunk look, but it was fun and easy, and really, isn't that what steampunk is all about?
I was surfing the Internet the other day and ran across a glowing review of a new eBook offering over at PCSecrets.com. The review was so good, I started to doubt the reviewer was legit, but the premise of the guide was too good to ignore.

Well I declare myself as both expressive and secretive. I like to express my thoughts and views at certain issues but like to keep my personal things private. I only share personal things with those who are close to me but even that, I still find many things being kept to myself :)

Well…it’s a full moon alright. I was saying to myself, well Joyanna, you can’t write about the stuff you usually do because you are so busy calling auto centers and saying, ”Do you have any Chevy Impala’s?” Yes, I am pretty much sick of any kind of car that was ever invented. I’ve been to at least 30 dealers. The cars are starting to all look like booby traps for insanity.
I think it’s safe to say that most of us when we think of the word ‘Confidence’ think of the second.
While Mr. Wonderful may not have been aware of Annie’s shenanigans behind his back, he was certainly aware of her open hostility. As soon as Annie learned that he had continued his affair throughout months of marriage counseling, it was Guadalcanal at their house. He left late one night with two suitcases. Annie thought that presented a perfect opportunity to dispose of whatever belongings he had left behind. So she went to the local grocery store parking lot and sold clothes, sports equipment, and tools out of the trunk of her car for ten cents on the dollar. Documents and keepsakes went missing too.
At 6.00 pm there's a new development. Leon Cornwall, a PRG and Central Committee member, who, with Hudson Austin, heads up the People's Revolutionary Army (PRA), delivers a statement. It's still a confusing mish-mash of rumour and counter rumour, but this time Maurice is finally mentioned. He's directly blamed for starting the original rumour and criticised for holding onto power for himself. The same rules apply to everyone, he says, and that is why action had to be taken against Maurice.
I’m a different person than that shy girl trying out for that Varsity Choir class. People that know me today, would be shocked to know I was at one time this shy girl. I had an obligatory 88th birthday party for my mother and invited my brothers, even through we don’t keep in touch (or speak). When they both continued with the same banter I remembered as I child….I told them both since it was probably the last time we would see each other I would be making a donation to the local Humane Society in their name, and it was time they each got a dog.
The recovery period nearly drove my wife insane. I came home one day at lunch to check on her only to find her watching Jersey Shore. The next day she dispatched me to Hobby Lobby to purchase her yarn and crochet needles. On day three she delivered the best line of the whole ordeal when she said, "I'm too old to watch Jersey Shore and too young to crochet.
I just wish there was more I could do.

I was sent Sex in the City 2 Soundtrack that pretty much rocks out my tiny CD player in the kitchen. Nothing too outrageous that the kids can't be around to hear. How many times have you watched a great movie and wanted to keep hearing the music. Thoughts of driving with the top down up in the hills with the leaves blowing above you and Alicia Keys "Rapture" blasting from every speaker in your car. You know, I relate music to a lot of life happenings.. Have you ever heard something and it took you back 10 years..maybe even 2 months? I have a terrible terrible terrible memory but I can blurt out every lyric of TLC's Shoop. A friend of mine and me in middle school made it a mission to memorized and act out this popular song in the 90s. And as embarrassing as that may be I still think of Ang every time I hear that song. What's your song moment?

There was a reason esoteric knowledge was kept secret for so long. A reason why the Church, the Mosque, the Temple were able to limit people’s knowledge for centuries. A reason why the secretive higher orders of the monotheistic religions held knowledge in thrall. Knowledge is power. And the reason why esoteric knowledge is so accessible now is indicative of the times and who you are who are seeking it. Even today, what the Seeker finds easily accessible on Internet remains inscrutable mystery to the masses.

1/2 Prince is definitely something to check on. It’s a manga based on an online game, gender-bender. I feel that this manga is compatible with reader from 13 – 15 years old, well it’s different from each person and what you prefer. This manga is funny, and creative and reminds you of many games. The game based manga is very alike the games we play these days. It’s really unique and the whole system. But unfortunately there isn’t many editors, scanners and translators so the release of the manga with English translate takes some times. Well I can’t help them out since if got seriously 0% knowledge with it, but if I could I would definitely join and help them. Between this manga is recommended for those who likes gender-bender and games. Also some love included.
1: I have a thought for those who run the consumer world. Shopping carts should be large enough to seat two small children. I took both kids to Target yesterday (one is 2 years 4 months and the other is 7 months). Therefore, Princess is too young to be able to walk on her own. She just isn't trustworthy right now. And Little Man is too big to be carried around in his carseat, and frankly, even if he was, that would take up even more space. So, it's just me and the kids at Target, meaning I can't push two carts. I put Little Man in the seat and Princess in the basket. Princess was all over the place, standing up, shouting "have that, have that" about everything we passed. She was causing my cart to fly all over the place. If the cart was just a little bigger, with 2 side by side seats, it would have made my shopping trip much less stressful.

“What I recalled most about Father Ralph’s homily as I lay in pain,” I continued, “was that I didn’t need to be present before St. Peregrine’s first-class relic at Stella Maris to state my petition. I remembered the story Father told about little Cooper from Victoria, TX.”

Above, recently discovered family photograph of the Dunhams during the early 1950s in Beirut, Lebanon. In 1953, Stanley Armour, Madelyn Dunham along with Ann Stanley was stationed in Beirut with Dr. Thetford, most likely than not as deep cover CIA agents.[50] Dr. Thetford’s primary research from 1950-1953 had centered on the personality development and fantasy projections of children.[51] Most likely than not, they had been clandestinely MK ULTRA briefed and trained on ultra secret projects involved in the development of cybernetic children through Wisner and Helm’s OPC of the U.S. State Department.
Then she looked down to see her loose sandal and her scowl returned. The sandal flopped with every sodden step down the corridor and threatened to come off. “Just what I need,” she muttered, wishing she had grabbed the captain’s boots. Thoughts of returning to get them were quickly replaced by worry that the two remaining soldiers would find the trigger that opens the trap door. She held the lamp aloft and examined the walls of the corridor as she walked. The walls and ceiling were engraved with more symbols and frescoes. The majority of the carvings depicted crude scenes of battle and strife on the streets of Nazerak, and they were cut very deep and savagely into the rock salt. Looking closer, Sharia noticed the rough ravings obliterated earlier, shallower wall engravings that depicted a different city than the one Sharia knew, a beautiful place with tall buildings and smiling crowds.

This is my favorite day on My Cricut Craftroom's blog. This time I decided to look at Smiley Cards since I was able to use it in Cricut Craftroom rather than with my Gypsy. Not sure why I had that ability and now it is gone but it was fun for a couple of days anyway.
It’s no secret that I’ve been writing like a lunatic lately. While I love posting something new every day, I am beginning to worry about burning out my muse. Starting next week, I will be reverting to my previous blog schedule where new posts will show up on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday.
One Thanksgiving day, after our big meal at my in-laws, we were sitting around, relaxing, when I said, “Wow, did you guys feel that cold air come through here?” I shivered. The kids shook their heads and they went about their business. Adam got up and walked through the kitchen, into the Hearth Room, where he had been playing with his Lego’s before we left.

That expectation, the one of sunshine and gentle life, is another thing that I find curious. Easter is a celebration of life, yes, but in some ways, it is a holiday of horrors and extreme emotion. As Christians tell the story, it’s preceded by a horrible death of a very good man. Jesus was also God and therefore perfect and innocent, and his death, completely undeserved, is considered an atonement for the sins that all the rest of us busily commit. There was great anguish and pain – not only His, but also for His disciples and others who loved Him – present for days. From the cross, an instrument of tortuous, suffocating death, Jesus cried out, “My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?” Pain, abandonment, disappointment, probably fear, maybe betrayal – Christ must have experienced, with dreadful immediacy, the whole, crushing range of dark human emotion until death relieved him of that burden. I imagine his disciples, family, friends, and other followers experienced similar, albeit somewhat less intense, feelings. They loved Him. They’d banked on His promises. Can you imagine how it must have felt to watch Him die? To live with the knowledge that He was gone, dead, and far beyond human reach? That Sabbath must have been a very dark and hopeless day for them.

Snap doesn’t do much but provide a few convenience methods to do the division necessary. It stays as small as possible by providing no ‘training wheels’…it won’t calculate styles or do DOM lookups…it assumes you’re already using a library for that. It also won’t check that you’re passing integers…it will blow up if you don’t.
For US chain Domino’s too, India is its fastest growing country outside its home market, with a market capitalisation only second to its American parent. Without divulging specific details of forthcoming plans, category leader Jubilant FoodWorks’ CEO Ajay Kaul says its ‘pizza mania’ platform is a ‘runaway success and an industry benchmark’. The listed Jubilant FoodWorks, with a network of 439 stores across 100 cities as of December 2011, posted 49% increase in system sales and 30% same store sales growth in the last-reported October-December 2011 quarter. Adds Kaul: “Domino’s Pizza, over the last several years, has become synonymous with affordability and value-for-money propositions.”
happy 2012 everyone!
We went to Shirley's Fabric store. I needed black embroidery floss. I was thrilled to finally find some there as I have been searching for it for quite a while now. I thought I wanted DMC, but Shirleys had Coats and Clark, and since that name is so familiar to an old sewer like me, I bought a handful of skeins. Hope they restock the black soon as this is all they had on their rack! The store had been given major adjustments to the inside look. So much better than it used to be-kudos!
And I wrote it down upon My heart

I'm sure many of you love shoes. Who doesn't? I know I do! It's the perfect way to complete your outfit and it can take your getup from day to night, from casual to chic, just by changing styles and heights. They're must-have investments and staples in every stylish girl-on-a-budget's closet!

Well, I skipped yesterday, because I thought what I wrote sucked. Had a pretty interesting weekend. Worked the whole damn thing, but managed to hang out with a couple of friends. Wait til I get my crap together….TFG, I figured out what those gay guys did to the rice crispy treats that made them taste funny….(No, no that you disgusting freaks.) It was 3 Olives Cherry Vodka….those crafty gays….Martha Stewart’s got nothing on y’all.

I did manage to shuffle/jog my way the last mile and actually picked up my feet the last tenth of a mile to cross the finish line. (Only to find out they didn't have any medals). They are supposedly mailing me a half marathon medal, but still. Kind of sucky.

This is not, repeat not, a political blog. I have my own reasons for disliking the Tea Party, but that aside the loosely defined group is a hitch in my kettle mainly because its existence has made searching for tea news and information increasingly difficult, especially online.
Andrew Robinson -- one of the most memorable villains in film history -- may be the most important part of the film. His performance as the Scorpio killer is just the right amount of insane and cunning. His plan to indict Callahan is what fuels the second half of the film (what is essentially the same narrative as the first half of the film, only this time we understand that Callahan has been told not to follow Scorpio around), and it’s a brilliantly executed scene as Robinson plays it so well that we aren’t sure if he’s a masochist and enjoys the beating, or if he just enjoys what’s going to happen to Callahan once his plan goes into full effect. I mean is there anything creepier than when Robinson utters the line, “I changed my mind. I think I’m going to let her die.” He’s just the perfect villain. Apparently Robinson was a pacifist and had real trouble shooting (and even holding) a gun. It must have been hell for Robinson to do the final scene; the memorable moment where Scorpio takes a school bus of children hostage on his way to the airport. It’s such a creepy, maniacal performance as he forces the kids to sing “Row Your Boat” over and over until he finally snaps when he sees Callahan waiting for him on a bridge as the bus drives by. It’s one of the most iconic shots of the film. Robinson, shockingly, didn't make many more movies immediately following the success of Dirty Harry. Perhaps he suffered from Anthony Perkins complex in that playing a villain so well and so convincingly, he was doomed to typecasting. He found a niche on television doing one-off roles (with the exception of "Ryan's Hope") until 1986 when he starred in the Sylvester Stallone action vehicle Cobra. A year later, he was once again a memorable movie villain (for about 20 minutes) in Clive Barker's Hellraiser. It's too bad he hasn't done much since (a lot of TV movies) because he gives what is arguably the most memorable performance in Dirty Harry.
“She may well have been drinking, GB, but she wasn’t lost. Some despicable forger put a note under her door inviting her to my quarters. She barged into my cabin and took off her gown before I could say a word. I had to throw a sheet around her! Here’s the note she got – read it yourself.”

“Despite the weak start to the year, the economy appears solid,” said Scott Hoyt, senior director of consumer economics, Moody’s Analytics. “Looking beyond temporary factors, GDP appears to be growing at an annual rate near 2.5%. While hardly a boom pace, this is strong enough to expand employment and reduce joblessness especially as some of the current drags wane in the second half of the year.”
At 3 PM (or 1500 as medicine uses military time) I took back one of my original patients and prepared for a fresh post-op case. He came out at 1700 and the race was on to do as much as I could get done before the next shift showed up at 1845 while also, you know, taking care of the patient. As I was saying to Mybloody last night, I once started to write a post about post-operative care of patients who required heart bypass during surgery but when it took three paragraphs just to establish the basics of hemodynamics, I deleted it. Too complicated and therefore boring for anyone that doesn't want to actually do it I think.
I went back on Metformin tonight. I am starting out on 500 mg./ day for the next seven days. If you care to know what this drug does see here: Metformin and PCOS . I am going to lose weight fairly easily on this drug as it controls my Insulin Resistance and High Testosterone issues. Metformin also blocks a percentage of carbohydrates from going from my digestive system to my blood system. One of the side effects is it makes you (me) sick as a dog while my body gets used to it....so there is another way I will lose weight -- I won't be over eating at all.

Everything was great and we were having some laughs when suddenly penises appeared and started waving all over the place. I stopped taking pictures at that point and started laughing very hard with my head down on the table. I know, I know -- it was the wrong decision, but I was taken by surprise by all the penises.

Outbreaks of paralysis using labels other than polio, such as NPAFP (non-polio acute flaccid paralysis), conveniently obscures polio outbreaks among vaccinated populations. Experts outside the vaccination dogma box point out there are other polio type maladies with different names, including NPAFP, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, and others.
When we recognise what God did for us in Jesus - dying for us so that our sin is paid for and we can be reconciled to God, and when we dwell on that love and that sacrifice and allow the truth of that to truly sink in, we are transformed from the inside.
I can’t begin to tell you how many of the people I work with who seem to have learned from an early age that pleasing others is a good way to receive validation or affection. By the time they come to see me it’s such a habit that when we talk about what they need to do, my suggestions have to go through a filter of thinking, “How can I do this for myself without letting others down?”

A month ago I was “learning to appreciate” this varietal. Well today, or better yet last night, I believe I am there. This particular wine spoke to me during our class and luckily I purchased 2 bottles. Regularly priced $9.99 but class price of $7.99 may have had something to do with it. I am so glad I did. This has to be the most delicate Torrontés I have tasted to date. Gone is the usual and almost overpowering strength of Lychee on the nose and palate.

I bribed him to write a little blog post for us, just because. So, just grab a beer and pretend like he’s all salty-dogged out, and doing his usual hand-gestures and sound effects.

Making Memories Love Struck quotes
I have an audio cassette of our first show. Victor Rice played bass, actually. I have to digitize it some time. It was, as I recall, January 3rd, 1991. The date is written on it… It was at a place called Hugos on Long Island. That was the venue for our second gig, too. We were very lucky – people took to us at our very first gig, and I don’t think we ever had a really shitty gig in the US after that. Sure, it happened occasionally on tour that we’d play to an empty room on a Tuesday in Little Rock or something, but we were one of the luckiest bands ever. Deal with the devil? You tell me.
I may be over 21 but the legal drinking age is 18. By all means ask for ID and ask with a smile, but I no more wish to drink in a place that bars 18-21 year olds any more than I would wish to stay in a guest house that bars blacks, Irish or homosexuals. I’m not a member of those 3 groups either, but if that’s your policy you can stick my custom up your arse.
Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy it.
For 17 minutes, we will push ourselves further, challenge ourselves deeper, feel the doubt and wonder what the hell we got ourselves into, and if we can make it, but then remember why we are there and appreciate fully those who we wish to honor. We turn to our community of friends and family, asking them to join us by donating what they are inspired to give to our two phenomenal organizations.
I sat back down and stared into the photo, then closed my eyes. The scene I’d left moments ago reappeared. His wife, a limp rag doll in his arms, was being placed into an SUV. He started up the engine and opened each of the windows. Motor running and the door closed, Seymour slipped out of the garage, got into his car and drove away.
Just before Christmas, Phil and I went to The Fashion Gallery with a friend. They had these giant clothes hangers out front. I asked Phil to pose with them so you could get an idea of the size. Right inside the door, you are greeted with a butler holding this sign. My favorite sign ever in a store! "Your husband called...He said to buy anything you want." But back to the hangers; I feel that it won't be long before I will be needing them this big for my clothes. The steroids I have been taking have gained me about 20 pounds in a month, I clearly cannot keep on like this. But it is not an option to stop the steroids, so I must diet or something. I am just seizing life, but perhaps I am seizing a bit too much...

ONE OF HIS MORE MEMORABLE QUOTES: “This is our generation’s Sputnik moment.” Sputnik, for those of you who haven’t a clue, was the first earth-orbited artificial satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. I thought America had its moment when we landed on the moon.
To accept Islam into Britain is akin to turning the other cheek but to reject Islam is to fight back. To accept calls of racism and racial hatred laws is only justified if the white Anglo Saxon is the one doing the calling and not some rainbow coloured free loader. Racism will only be a hate crime whilst it is aimed at the white population so by not accepting it we fight back. Whilst the establishment is busy integrating all manner of foreigners into this country we should be reminding them that this country is British, we are not Islamists nor are we racists but most of us are pure Anglo Saxon White Protestants who dislike these changes and want our country back.
Elie and Lauren climbed back up to our perch and the barbecue resumed. A while later, another ambulance arrived and the boy was transferred from the Intensive Care ambulance to a regular one and taken to the hospital. I've had this sense of "panic" - too strong a word, but there you go - before. I felt it that time, many months ago, when I realized the Elie, Shmulik, AND Chaim were all going on a call after a report of a building on fire, and other times.
This is for a Sweet Sixteen who has a plan for her future. I will stand for her until she can do that for herself. She, like all of your children, deserves the best we can give them. This current government is not doing their best, not for her or anyone else.
Now our walls look like this. Okay, really they look much more lavender than in this photo. (See the photo of Ben near the top of the post.) And this was as much of the wall as I could squish into the photo. One day I'll figure out the whole lighting/wide-angle lens thing. Still, you can see that my husband did a stinkin' awesome job on the stenciling.

But then Julian emerged from his tent, wearing nothing but a pair of athletic pants. Her vision tunneled like she was in an Alfred Hitchcock movie, and she found her legs didn’t work quite as well as they used to. She already knew he was strong, that his chest was a hard-packed surface of muscles that radiated heat. But seeing, in this case, was more than believing. It was swooning, drooling, falling to the ground in a pool of hormonal bliss.

So yes, we are going to demand to know our candidate’s principles and their stance on all of those important issues — including their reasons — because, hey, voters also want to know if their candidates have actually put some modicum of thought into what they stand for (or perhaps I am asking for too novel a concept)?

I hope everyone had a great New Years. A few of us got together at Johns New Years Eve and just hung out and ate a bunch of food and played some games although I did have a few beers also. Today the gym was loaded up with the New Years resolution crowd, in a few weeks it will be back to normal again I am sure. I am not real big on New Years resolutions although I hope to have more patience, be a bit less selfish(except for running) and be a better father and husband too.

The breast exam video played without controversy. During the male genital asessment video though, there was a bit of an uproar. The "patient" in the video was uncircumcised and the narrator explained that with such patients, the examiner asks them to retract their foreskin. The guy in the video did and you'd think there was mouse in there or something. Gasps and actual muffled screams from the ladies in the audience (I didn't hear any of the five other guys, but maybe they freaked too). I'm not sure exactly why they were so surprised and/or horrified. Once he pulled it back it looked like a circumsized penis, something I assume they'd seen before. Maybe they were shocked by the amount of foreskin? Cause he did have a lot. Whatever the reason, it cracked me up to see and hear such an extreme reaction.

A more festive custom enjoyed by both the Korowai and the Kombai is the eating of the Sago grub, the succulent larva of the Capricorn beetle, which is a delicacy the tribes harvest from rotting trees. Very occasionally the Kombai host parties to which guests from other tribes are invited and fed Sago grubs, while even more seldom still the Korowai will host a Sago grub festival to encourage fertility and prosperity. Such rituals seem to anchor the deeply spiritual lives of these people, who see spirits in the forest where outsiders would see none.

The experiment also found activation in the amygdala, a brain region associated with emotional reactions, but only in cases where participants refused to take cash to state the opposite of what they believe. "Those statements represent the most repugnant items to the individual," Berns says, "and would be expected to provoke the most arousal, which is consistent with the idea that when sacred values are violated, that induces moral outrage."
How could I tell? Because of my approach, and because of my heart. I started with a defined end state. I knew how I needed to start and end. I knew how long I had. I was doing it for a specific purpose. I was THINKING it, instead of FEELING it. And it just never felt right.
Perhaps the higher truth is as simple as this: the opposition of public and private, and the insistence the administration is stewarding us in a single direction is itself inadequate to understand the present situation. “The public” in fact persists; it now refers to purchasers, who literally have no business on the quad; the businesses await behind the Memorial Union’s doors. We might, we must demand “public education” because this is an idea cherished by the public.

Madoka I have lots of problem. I am annoyed by their “show back-story of the girl who got her head bit off 5 minute before she dies to invoke some emotion into you“. I also hate the ” you should feel all sad with this boring blue hair girl and her complicated relationship with the boy she likes while we play heavy, emotional music and let the character have over the top expression of crazy desperation so you know you should feel sad here.” They are terrible because they couldn’t manipulate me into having the emotions they want to emulate. It’s just out right distracting and annoying because I am always pondering of whether I really should feel sad here or laugh at this failed attempt of making me sad.

Mrblocko and Blockette liked it a lot, but they said that they wouldn't want to eat it every day. I thought the oatmeal could use more sugar, but "more sugar" and "morning" are not a good combination for me. I think I'm just used to the over sweetened pre-packaged Quaker version of oatmeal.

“She was rushed to Sawai Man Singh hospital and is undergoing treatment at the burn ward. The police in our village did not bother to register an FIR,” said a relative of the girl.
Like I said: I can really only speak for the Intuitive’s perspective on this one. I have – seriously – no clue how a sensor thinks. I only recently became even slightly interested in developing my sensory side this year, when I took up painting and roller derby (that’s a story for a whole ‘nother post).
There are many ways to crop a photo and it all depends on the elements captured in that photo. Digital cameras are packed with larger and larger megapixel. When it comes to cropping, having a large megapixel camera (at least 10MP, in my opinion) helps in preserving those finer details. On the web, it may not look so obvious but comes to printing, it does make a difference.
The results one year on are dramatic; I don't just mean that I'm now a published author, either. I finally left the band for good last month (I'm going to their first gig without me on Thursday, and looking forward to it now that I'm free of the stress of playing). I killed the webcomic for good back in July. I couldn't get rid of the PhD that easily - the best way to get free of it is just to push ahead and finish as quickly as possible - but I'm more or less up to the half-way point of the work, and hoping to do most of the rest in the oncoming year. I've even more or less sorted out my personal life.

The opening track Riddle Of You gives an instant indication of the progressive nature of the release with its initial bubbling melodic beckoning towards the ear. The song soon expands into a striking creature as the track slowly rises to its feet. Muscular riffs start flexing and leading the cause as the fine vocals of Johnston starts unveiling the heart of the song. The riffs continue to niggle and badger the ear as the melodic invention infuses within the powerful intensity. Lit up by the magnetic pull of the melodic enterprise that pours from the song as it progresses, the senses are captivated and eager to drive further into the album though the lengthy ten minute opener ensures the wait is very satisfying and the following Slightly Out of Breath ensuring it was worthy while.

This would all take place December 2010. But, like some of you might have heard, the airports across Europe were closing down due to weather and partly because they were running out of de-icener. Crazy! Europe really isn’t prepared for winter when it comes to snow and ice. So, Heathrow, the airport my sister was flying into was shut down for a few days as well because of old man Winter. What happened then ? L’s flight got cancelled and my dreams to finally hold the sister I so longed for went down the drain.
So how has my life changed since talking with Georgia Peach three weeks ago? (Georgia Peach, by the way, has a family member diagnosed with Celiac.) Well, I'm trekking much further to the grocery store now.

I was reminded of this conversation on hearing that the police in Vancouver have paid damages to a lawyer they believed was plotting to throw a pie at the prime minister. In their zeal to protect the nation’s chief executive, they arrested the lawyer and subjected him to a strip search, expecting to find a pie hidden in his rectum. But the lawyer was much too crafty to hide the pie there, realising it would be the first place the police would look. So the police found no evidence of the conspiracy, and the lawyer rubbed salt into their wounds by suing them for wrongful arrest and unjustified digital penetration.

They named the tract “Beech Haven” in honor of its dense population of beech trees, and made plans to build a large summerhouse on a hill overlooking the creek. Effie chose a location that would allow cool breezes to blow through, and drew up the architectural plans to include high ceilings and expansive porches. It was, after all, a summerhouse.

In contrast, Beckett’s references to contemporary literature are few and far between: Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye he liked “more than anything for a long time”. For me, however, the great revelation of the letters is Beckett’s occasional engagement with the work of Maurice Blanchot. As early as October 1948, he acknowledges receipt of an unspecified essay sent by Duthuit, presumably for translation. Three years later Duthuit has Beckett translate passages from what is presumed to be Sade’s Reason and “the foreword” to Faux Pas which just happens to contain this passage:
Ok, ok, I know I went off topic for a bit. So, we didn’t not have nearly as much time as we wanted to see everything, which realistically, would have taken us days to accomplish. We spent sometime at the Herb Ritts exhibition since it wasn’t permanent and I love photography. It was mind blowing to see all those celebrity portraits from the late 80s and early 90s, mainly because they didn’t feel like celebrities, Herbs had a way to get into the soul of the sitter and expose their true nature.

The World War I Papers in the Military Collection of the North Carolina State Archives include a number of invaluable private manuscript collections. Of these collections, the largest and undoubtedly the most interesting to students of science are the papers of Col. Joseph Hyde Pratt of Chapel Hill, commander of the 105th Engineers. A native of Connecticut, Pratt earned a bachelor of philosophy degree and a doctorate from Yale University. He moved to North Carolina in 1897 to join the Toxaway Company and to work as a mineralogist with the N.C. Geological Survey. Soon thereafter, he was appointed state mineralogist, a post he held until named state geologist in 1906. In these capacities, Pratt was credited with the discovery of several minerals. He was also active in the acquisition of land for state and national forests, and in the nascent State Highway Commission, serving as its secretary for a period. A member of the state guard since 1913, Pratt enlisted in the army on July 24, 1917, and was commissioned a major of engineers. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in November and assigned to command of the 1st Battalion of the 105th Engineer Regiment, which assembled for training at Camp Sevier, South Carolina.
Of course every day here looks like a sunny day you’d find front and center in a postcard and the film is super full of the values that are adored by the conservative demographic that makes up a nice portion of Mr. Sparks’ target audience, while still providing the sexy scenes with the sexy actors to draw in the other demos. But it kind of works as that romance in Louisiana story; it’s just hurt quite a lot by the fact that the secret that Logan’s keeping just looms over the whole movie even if it’s not mentioned, especially because it’s not that big a deal when you dissect it had he just told it when he arrived there. But it’s when the film tries to go all heavy-handed dramatic with Beth’s ex that it’s just too bad to bear.
Laurel Brown from the blog Nostrand Park came by to talk to us about her interest in Crown Heights. She has lived in Crown Heights for 3 years. She studies law, but she is doing a documentary on gentrification in the neighborhood. She is a really cool person. One can never be bored talking to her; she is full of life and a very good listener. She gave us advice on how to reach out to people for our project and gave us names of people who can help us achieve our goals.
“Now, we are planning for something new,” she says. “A Jewish friend and I wanted to create a long-term project to let women meet in a social setting and speak casually about shared cultural issues. So we are beginning to host a once-a-month gathering for activist Jewish and Arab women to meet, speak about themselves, and get to know each other. It is good for the Arab and Jewish women to hear about the other side, their habits, their holidays.”

Like the ducks who wouldn’t take her bread, the cat who didn’t want to be stroked, the horses in the field by Thirsk Road who went crazy every time she walked past. She couldn’t shake the school visit to Flamingo Land where every flamingo panicked and fled before she reached the lake. Or her short-lived goldfish, Rhett and Scarlett – the only pets she had ever been allowed. The total horror that first morning when she found them floating upside down on the water’s surface, with the colour drained from their scales.

I enjoyed the performances of just about everyone, but felt the romance between Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried was out of place. It felt chemistry-less and forced. Their relationship would have resonated more had they found themselves becoming friends.
But, there is a bonus for longest rail. Toward the end of the game, Mila brought up the topic of longest rail and we paused to count out the length of everyone's rails. We all assumed Tap's rail was longest. It just LOOKED like it was. However, looks can be deceiving and when we counted it out, my rail was a bit longer. I sort of wished the issue had not come up when it did.

There have always been tricksters who take advantage of other people and make money by engaging in fraud. However, there have been predictions that incidences of fraud will increase in the coming year and some experts in fraud prevention and detection have suggested various ways to prevent fraudulent practices. What is it that has prompted these suggestions? Why do they expect fraud to increase?
Honestly, I’m pretty terrible at practical application, mostly because I think sometimes that takes the magic out of things, but below are just a few suggestions to think over when it comes to the practice of worship…whether you’re alone or with thousands.

"Terroir" is a French word we usually think of in relationship to winemaking. It means "land," or "earth," and is shorthand for goût de terroir, literally "taste of the earth." Winemakers talk of terroir as the totality of the effect of place on grapes and wine: the soil, the altitude, the latitude, the surrounding topography, the climate, the local flora and fauna.

Secret funds buy hideaway for top cops
Since the county that I live in is the worst in this already pathetic state for adult services, there isn’t much to pick from. Like many families, I am facing the reality of what little there is. And what little funding there is. So aside from the emotional aspect of this transition, there is a huge financial component that, when looked at beyond the near future, but more into the long-term, it can truly bring me to my knees.

Lacy had trouble breaking through the Dodgers' vaunted infield in the '70s. He was one of those players that I wished would get a chance to be a starter -- preferably pushing Bill Russell out of the starting shortstop role. I was disappointed that Lacy was traded to the Braves in the Dusty Baker deal, figuring that would be Lacy's big break.

These grants enable writers to attend a seminar, conference, workshop or teaching event. State arts commissions sometimes issue professional development grants to enable conference attendance. However, nothing beats contacting a conference organizer directly with a request for financial assistance. Even local conferences, like the South Carolina Writers Workshop Conference, offer financial aid.

It was a lovely party. I saw some old friends, Lynne Chapman and Anne Rooney, from Facebook, SAS and SCWBI. Made some new friends and got a bit squiffy on the mulled wine. I even bravely ate half a mince pie and it was ok - promise. I had a lovely chat to the publisher, Simon Rosenheim who talked about how fiercely independent Meadowside is and I said I felt really at home here. Its good to have a publisher who is 100% behind your ideas. I also talked to Catherine about foreign rights and New York Art Galleries and to Rupert about sales. Meadowside publishes over 40 titles a year and has an established reputation for good books. That feels the right place to be. 2011 is going to be a great year!
The beginning of February last year I decided it was time. Time to organize those boxes full of mismatched, misplaced pictures. I wanted organization and I wanted it to look nice. I wanted to be able to file pictures away and know exactly where they were. I wanted to be able to go to the box I needed when my kids would come home with projects for school and they would need pictures of themselves. But most of all, I wanted to be able to keep these memories from getting wrinkled, torn and ruined from lack of organization.

A friend of mine has recently started a photography and art blog and to be honest it something quite wonderful.

However, if you wish to discuss what you had for tea last night I'm sure he wouldn't mind that either.
JS - If that’s the situation, how worried are you that you are setting a precedent here that any club with debts they find they can’t pay can simply go into administration, re-emerge through liquidation and come back as a newco.

Fears may inhibit you from moving forward and completing the tasks you set out to do. Fears are about the future and only increase if that is what you focus on. To decrease your fear (of failure, success, how others will judge you, etc.) it is important to focus on what is right in front of you.
Customers want to spend money. This is not some magical formula. Retail is not surprising. Customers enter, give you money, and leave with a product or service. The same is true in an online environment. As a Manager, or Sales Person, it is your responsibility to remove obstacles to this process.

Ben Frost — Stomp / Scanner Remix
- In Luke’s version, Jesus concludes the model of the prayer of dedication He is teaching His disciples by also indicating that without forgiveness they cannot be the Father’s envoys to bring forth the Kingdom. For His is a kingdom of Love and since He Is Love, His Love must rule your heart. If we do not forgive, we are in sin and we CANNOT do His will when we are in rebellion against His will! But if we sin we have an advocate before the father, so that if we confess our sins we will be forgiven (1Jn.1:8-10). The concluding line indicates our awareness of our human weaknesses and tendency to sin and asks that He keep us from trials that will lead us to sin. Again, in the Catholic tradition, after we confess our sins in the Sacrament of Reconciliation, we ask that He “… keep us from the near occasions of Sin” or situations that are beyond our spiritual maturity and wisdom so that we will not fail to bring forth fruit for His Glory and For His Kingdom.

Each month a bit of joy ends up in my mailbox. Reminisce magazine and Reminisce Extra (both bi-monthly) is chalk full of wholesome memories and stories from yesteryear. Sure, lot's of unhappy things happened back then too. However if you dwell on the bad times, you'd be quite unhappy, but I think we can learn from our past. Everyone has their own trials and tribulations. What matters is how you handle them.

The magic of Roberto and Sabrina is grounded in their admiration and respect for one another, but also in their working partnership. They’re the perfect team, combining individual know-how, capability as master chefs, maitre’d's, and whatever else has been needed. They have their own orto, vegetable and herb garden, and have been known to raise their own free range chickens as well. In the early days, they ran the villa by day, waited tables at night, ran the kitchen and nearly single-handedly rebuilt the buildings, as their vision grew. Now, they can relax a little (although they usually don’t), since they have added a wonderful chef, Gabrielle, as well as other staff to make sure things run smoothly.

It's a hard question to answer because I don't think it's the same for everyone. But here's how it worked for me. The first thing was that I had to really confront what happened head on. I couldn't just bundle it up into an "I was abused" package and move on from there. I had a lot of repressed memories and I had a lot of memories I just didn't want to acknowledge as being real. I had to bring those memories to the surface and face them head on and accept that they happened to me, they were real, and I wasn't just making things up. That was some of the hardest work I did. Facing those memories meant flashbacks at times, lots of tears, stomach aches, heartache. Thankfully, I was in a very safe place to be able to work through them since I was in a locked down unit of a hospital. When I agreed to go into the hospital program, I was serious about changing my life. I was serious about doing the work. I didn't know how hard it would be- but I knew I'd survived it once and would survive it again.
Johnny fricking Unitas. I love this guy and the card is just classic looking. The price tag was only 5 bucks and the card is in amazing shape. I knew I was leaving with this card! After seeing very little in terms of hockey cards, I bundled a bunch of cards together and made a deal I couldn't refuse. So in the end, Mr. Unitas came home with me for less than a 5 spot.
DON’T: Mistake the genuine, “OMG, this is the best book I’ve ever read,” from your family and friends as legitimate critique. It’s not. It’ll never be. And as great and inspiring as it is to hear, until that manuscript is in actual book form – it means nothing on your journey towards publication. Harsh…but true.

I do collect my affirmations in piles of little notes and sticky notes and journals…all around the place. I stick them to my bathroom mirror and to the sun shade in my car. Now I have them collected with some of my favorite colors and background techniques and all artful. And I can carry them with me! As I used a ring that I can open and close, I can also add to the ring when I’m working on a new affirmation or mantra…and I have extra circles cut so that when I want to play but don’t have anything particular artsy in mind, I can make more affirmation cards. Fun fun!!
There is much to be gained by taking a step back to examine the broader stage on which some movement is insisting upon itself. Its often a step never taken, resulting in tunnel vision that at a minimum, hinders innovation, but in the worst cases can cripple companies, industries, and civilizations. Am I getting too dramatic? Jim Collins describes the value of this “zooming out” quite well in his newest book Great By Choice. In extremely short summary, he states that the most successful leaders have the ability to zoom in to intensely understand their domain and equally to zoom out to understand the environment in which that domain exists. Like all of Collins’ arguments, the suggestion is backed by carefully analyzed empirical data. I recommend the book.
Justin was great. He listened. And then he laid out a plan for what we'll do--which was exactly what I needed at a time. I needed someone to delegate for me. He told me about the quiet car ride we'll have with adult music. That it can be a fun(ish) weekend away instead of just a trip for the procedure. Maybe I'll even be able to convince him to eat at Cafe Yumm ;)

I'm loving these shades and reaching for them often. I honestly think you can't go wrong picking up either samples or petit sizes from Darling Girl. The prices are fantastic for testing and trying and I have yet to be disappointed by any of my Darling Girl purchases. I'm also a nerd and the fact that I'm wearing, say, "Mayor's Daughter" and "Boy With The Bread" on my eyes makes me happy. If you were only to purchase one shade from the collection, Mayor's Daughter would be my pick (and pick up some Glitter Glue to go with it!).

Blessing beads. A really good friend of mine designed these and I gave them away during a gathering of friends I had hosted. Every night I use them to list the blessings in my life. It’s pretty hard to think you’ve had a rotten day when there is so much to be grateful for. There are beads for 11 blessings and the final large bead is used to send out a wish for someone or something else. When I gave these away I told my friends that if they couldn’t come up 11 things to be grateful for every single day of their lives then they weren’t paying attention.
When I was about 9 years old my dad bought me a hot glue gun. Accompanied by a scalpel and balsa wood, I used to enjoy making structures and boxes. They weren’t anything in particular but I loved it. My dad enjoyed encouraging my creativity and I loved making things – it was a win-win!
VG: I like the cricket analogy - but how does it work if there are two versions of the first stanza? which one leaks, from your point of view??
For the quilt, I had to prep 80 leaves, 8 big flowers, 2 small flowers, 8 rosebuds and circles for all. It took me all morning, but was so much fun working on this while watching the snow falling outside my window.

In terms of it’s depiction of female characters, this show nails it on the head. I might not be a fan of Cersei and her horrendous scheming but her reasons behind her actions are often easy to understand as are the more sympathetic Catelyn Stark’s actions too. Also when you consider the characterisations for the likes of Sansa, Arya and Daenerys. That and the rather interesting depiction of Renly’s relationship with Ser Loras and this is a show that effectively covers all kinds of fan bases.

While I could not find the court’s decision (the link appears to be broken – check the source later on just in case – here) I believe the case is straightforward. Yet there are many things which we can speculate. 1.- Have Coca-Cola registered the name ‘zero’ alone? If so, then I believe that the next action will be the invalidation of the mark. 2.- If the mark zero is a combination i.e. Coca-Cola zero, then the use of the word ‘zero’ alone does not deter other business for using it, specially if the word is not distinctive enough. 3.- Is the word ‘zero’ used by Ambet identical to the one used by Coca-cola? There is the need of a global appreciation test, not just an aural assessment. For instance, are they written in the same font, or colour, or style, or is the word in combination with other words or logo? If so, the marks are not identical but similar. 4.- It is understood that Coca-Cola is using the word ‘zero’ as describing that the drink does not contain sugar and this idea just put into my mind: is Ambet using the word also as to identify beverages that are free of sugar? What about if the use of the mark is to identify drinks that are for consumers of free will or free spirit, or open minded? In this case the word zero will be distinctive for Ambet’s products and still not distinctive for Coca-Cola – an awkward moment since the sentence could backfire Coca-Cola’s intention i.e. invalidating Coca-Cola mark and opening the doors to Ambet for the protection of the same word – some will call it an unfortunate event.

Let’s not tell any fairy tales here. Any criticism of Islam is a ‘hate crime’ to every Muslim. Thus ‘hate crime’ legislation will help enforce a case of the totalitarianism of the mind, which in turn will effectively prohibit any and all criticism of Muslims qua Muslims, the Koran and Mohammed the Paedophile… sorry, the Prophet.

I only purchased two bottles from the new Hans Christian Andersen collection but I thought you might enjoy some reviews! I ordered The Red Clouds and A Merry Life from Violette Market’s etsy shop on 1/16/12 and received them on 1/25/12. As always the Violette Market bottles come individually wrapped in plastic and then in a little mesh bag. I also received free samples of Dark Moon Kiss, Smoking Plum and Moroccan Market.
Mr. Bergman told people the ensemble’s albums, unlike most comedy records, were never made to be listened to just once or twice. “He said our records were made to be heard about 80 times,” Mr. Austin said.

Of course, by this point, the boys were both totally exhausted, annoyed at being ignored and snapped at while mommy and daddy worked, and also very excited about the new beds. Bug kept wanting to sleep on the bottom. "I wanta sleep with Gizmo!" And once Gizmo realized it wasn't a game to sleep in the new bed, he wanted nothing to do with it.

First, I noted that this is a song that was meant to be sung. “For the director of music” must mean that it was for the orchestra or choir director or both. Thus, there would be a performance of this song at the court, or perhaps in the temple. It is certainly not meant to be left lying flat on a piece of parchment collecting dust. Michael Wilcock interprets the Psalm through a number of lenses, one of them being ‘liturgy.’ He writes, ‘Psalms begin to appear which are suited, or intended, for corporate use. In this respect Psalm 22 is like Psalm 20 and 21. Although it is I who speak throughout, this is my praise in the great assembly, and in the congregation I will praise you (22:25, 22).” (Wilcock, Psalm 1-72 in the Bible Speaks Today Series, 79).

Brody was MIA for most of the weekend eating due a hockey tournament, but he made up for it Sunday night. I requested steak for my birthday dinner and the best place around us is Jacobson Bros (they also make killer potato salad). We picked up two bacon-wrapped filets before swinging by Market Street Diner for a sweet treat (Brody doesn’t bake). I chose a slice of turtle pie and Brody got carrot cake. When we ate around 7:30, we accompanied the steak with roasted veggies (potatoes, sweet potato, onion, and fennel).
But, like i said, I wouldn't buy new. I like the old. It suits me.

Back to reality. Myles Allen at Oxford has a vivid way of simplifying the scale of the task involved in preventing carbon levels rising above 450ppm. The modern world has been built on half a trillion tons of carbon. At present rates of increase we will burn the next half trillion tons in 40 years. The best guess is that that will result in a one-degree rise. There are, perhaps, four to five trillion tons of burnable carbon still in the Earth. But the maximum we can burn is half a trillion tons. In Copenhagen, therefore, the talks should be about allocating that half trillion as if it were a gigantic carbon cake. To make this work and ensure we don’t burn more than that, Allen goes for a radical option. “It will only work,” he says, “in the context of a plan to get emissions down to zero by the end of the century. So I think we need what none of the politicians seems prepared to acknowledge. A rationing system for putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is only a temporary measure; eventually the whole practice has to be banned.”
‘I was eighteen, and I’d just come out of the pub where we’d been rehearsing this play – I can’t remember what it was, don’t ask. Anyway, I came out of the pub, and it was a full moon, bright and round, so I thought I’d walk home and save the fare. So I started walking, and there was no one around. Except for this man, who started to follow me on the other side of the road. Well, I knew what that was all about. So I started to run, and he did, too. So after a while I thought I’ll cut through the stadium and lose him there. And that’s what I did. He chased me through the stadium, but he had no chance. I skipped over the fence the other side and that was that.’

I figured I could take a nap in the terminal, except for the fact that a million people decided that they were going to win their retirement on the goddamn slot machines right next to us. SHUT. UP. Not to mention the airport was kept at a breezy 10 degrees. Awesome.
Knowing I just had 9 miles left I tried to tell myself it would be just like a longer week day run and I can do this. I ate a Bonk Breaker bar and that helped a lot. It gave me a lot of energy and helped me starting putting miles back down. I look back and think the Gatorade I had might have made my problem worse. I swear someone added tons of sugar to it when handing it out. I learned a lot about fluids though on the race.
For the player pool, I am removing all players who played less than 40% of available minutes and took less than 20% of available shots during those minutes, resulting in a group of 41 players on the men’s side and 49 players for the women. I am doing this to restrict the group of “scorers” to only those who played significant minutes and were expected to score during those minutes. To generate a player’s scoring rating (SCR), I took a player’s percentage above or below the group average for all three statistics (a Shot% of 26.3%, a TS% of 0.528, and a TO% of 15.6% for the men; 25.6%, 0.486, and 18.1% for the women) and averaged them out. In this way, I think I have a fairly accurate read on who the best scorers were during this past season.
Thank GOD for expats. Or my colleagues would've had to deal w/ that Pepperidge Farms crap, and I couldn't have that.
Metaphors may also be used in ways that introduce bias to mainstream news, but often go unnoticed because they are so engrained in the way that we speak. Otto Santa Ana discusses the ways in which language used by the media can create and maintain negative images of groups of people in his book “Brown Tide Rising.”
In a burst of desire to eat a bit healthier, we started flipping through my "exercise plan" book which also has a section on nutrition. I told Brad to pick some recipes that he would be interested in and I'd see what I could do. Well, he decided that lentil soup might be interesting and the search was on. A quick internet search turned up a recipe by Giada de Laurentis of tv fame and we decided that she probably knew what lentil soup should taste like. And you know what? That was a great bet to make because this soup is tasty! Enjoy!

There’s never a good time to be laid off, but this was especially bad, because we immediately lost our health insurance, and my wife was scheduled for hernea surgery the next week. So we had to buy very expensive Cobra insurance to pay for her operation. Also, we had just purchased non-refundable airline tickets for trips to both Colorado and Montana later that summer.
This is based on a 1952 movie of the same name and though I haven’t seen the original I fully enjoyed this as a conventional 90′s thriller. On a Scale of Pride and Clark to Grey Goose I give this a Svedka. I wouldn’t run out to find it but if you ever catch it on AMC check it out.

In pondering all six seasons, I couldn’t help but think of something William Faulkner—no stranger to the concept of time and man’s relation to it—wrote in his novel Light in August: “Memory believes before knowing remembers. Believes longer than recollects, longer than knowing even wonders.” Complicated? Yes. Thoroughly engrained into the world of Lost? You bet.
10. How are your new year's resolutions going?
I'm going to change things such as having the A Line at a Time project be a full month thing instead of bi-weekly. The Pic 1 k will be changed a little bit too. Also, I'm going to propose and look for "feature weeks" featuring one or two people with just their work all week long. Trust me, the changes will be sweet.
I see that Dr Peter West, retired university lecturer and social commentator, is in today's Age fulminating on the bad manners of Young People at the Opera and the Consequent Decline and Fall of Civilisation. Apparently nobody obeys Rules any more. It's all the fault of entitled young people with their newfangled phones, according to Dr West. Or possibly people on drugs. Anyway, I was inspired, and decided to list some Rules of my own.

Six-bedroom homes sleep around 14 people in your vacation nights like this can result in a foreign country with all the orange beach vacation home of your holiday too, so you still may be in anyone's way. Also, many of the housing communities throughout Kissimmee feature an abundance of communal amenities. From clubhouse, fitness center or business center access to satisfy both teenagers and younger children. Some of these rentals will also get additional benefits of a condo, so you could easily play both in the sauna.
The next class is Monday night. So now my plan is to show up, take a trial class, see how my ACL-lessknee holds up, see how I like it.

The narrator’s name, if it was ever presented, does not come to memory, and we hear the story, firsthand, from him. He is very present in his memories and, in his memories, very present in the moment. The first book describes some very lovely effects of light and flowers and food. The second book, it seems, delves a little into the fragile nature of our emotional selves, but it also sees the narrator develop the idea of how his own actions affect others. In this passage he refers directly to “loving-kindness” as he relates the turmoil he experienced in deciding to go to the theatre
