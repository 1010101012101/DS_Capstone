The script: Maybe no position on Oregon's roster is as easily replenished as the defensive line. UO rotates its front seven to remain fresh because of all the time the defense spends on the field thanks to the team's no-huddle offense.

The primary threat could be Armstead, who at 6-8, 290 pounds would make the perfect strong-side defensive end opposite the more agile Jordan on the weakside. Defensive tackle is loaded with the return of Isaac Remington and Ricky Heimuli.

Two weeks ago, Fox commentator Bill O'Reilly and Newt Gingrich used the term "San Francisco values" as the three dirtiest words they could think of to label future Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (and her Democratic brethren). While politer pundits rally for and against what these words mean, citing liberal issues and pot clubs and immigration, we all know what "San Francisco values" posited as dirty words really mean. When someone says, "San Francisco values," they mean sex.

I wanted to do that kind of cult-deprogramming story differently, so I starting searching for something to focus on within that realm. I found a few sentences about a woman who escaped and made it to a bus stop. The cult leader caught up with her and instead of taking her back or reacting violently, he bought her a ticket and wished her well. That, to me, just seemed so creepy.

Across the rotunda, Senate President Brandon Shaffer has been no better. Perhaps the low spot of his personal legislative agenda is a grandstanding bill that would penalize lawmakers in the very unlikely event that a state budget wasn't passed on time.

Most of Amtrak's long-distance trains use double-deck Superliner equipment, but those cars won't fit through the tunnels into New York City, so overnight trains fanning out from there — to Florida, New Orleans and on two routes to Chicago — use single-level equipment. Sleeping cars are Viewliners, so named because the two levels of windows provide views from upper and lower berths. Dining cars are in the Heritage Fleet, a creative euphemism for old. Still, I find them perfectly functional, even attractive, and they are a source of nostalgia for longtime train riders.

This countercultural Brigadoon populated by shaggy square pegs and passive-aggressive druggies is the proving ground for their relationship in Wanderlust, David Wain's riotous, raunchy, and more than a little raggedy showcase for Rudd's improv genius and Aniston's airy groundedness. He is gut-busting funny, she gently ticklish - ideal comic rapport.
Chatting with Elena Skye from her Hoboken apartment, she recalled moving to town from Manhattan at the height of the city’s gentrification. “I grew up Chicago, went to college in Vermont, then started coming to New York City to play CBGB with a rock band I was in at the time,” she explained. “I fell in love with the city and knew this was where I wanted to live, so I moved to New York City for about six years and then came to Hoboken to open Blackwater Books around 1985.”

They handle a range of tasks.

These include local pain and bruising, minor bleeding, and lightheadedness. Serious side effects are rare.

Adverse reactions such as these have significantly declined since 1988, when using disposable and sterilized needles was required by law and when more rigorous requirements for acupuncture training were mandated.

Today he claims to be for jobs and the middle class, yet he was willing to destroy both by killing off GM and Chrysler.

All this makes Social Security "welfare." Benefits shift; they're not strictly proportionate to wages but are skewed to favor low-wage earners -- a value judgment reflecting who most deserves help; and they aren't paid from workers' own "contributions." But we ignored these realities and encouraged people to think they "earned" benefits and that Social Security is distinct from the larger budget. Politicians, pundits, think-tank experts and journalists engaged in this charade to spare Social Security's 54 million recipients the discomfort of understanding they're on welfare.

The film's a passable B-grade spy-flick divertissement -- but its script, look, editing, music, action choreography, grim tone and cynical view of the bureaucrats who run the espionage game seem so blatantly lifted (intentionally or not) from the last two "Bourne" movies, you wonder if they had DVDs on set for reference.

So an international group of researchers combed through 19 studies - most of them designed to investigate cancer - and found data on 1.46 million white adults between the ages of 19 and 84.

Natural gas prices are low and drilling in the gas-rich Marcellus shale has tapered off. But Chesapeake is tapping eastern Ohio's deeper Utica shale, where it's finding not only dry gas but also natural gas liquids. Propane, ethane, butane -- aka "the 'tanes." Plus oil.

At the risk of coming across as a nag and a scold  one of those pesky "declinists" and "dystopian journalists" the governor lambasted in this year's State of the State address  slippery fast talk isn't befitting a leader of Jerry Brown's pedigree. It's not in keeping in the spirit of a no-frills, no-spin governorship.

One of my favorite post-induction rituals in years past was repairing to Sir Harry's, a small bar in the Waldorf-Astoria. After our deadlines, my fellow reporters and I would convene there to dilute the adrenaline still coursing through our veins with outrageously expensive libations and swap war stories into the wee hours. Occasionally, we found ourselves in the presence of greatness, as when Eddie Levert of the O'Jays dropped in for a drink.

Since you are dealing with a mature tree, it's important that water penetrate deeply into the soil surface. The simplest option would be to lay soaker hose in the area and allow it to penetrate deeply into the ground. Another option would be to install deep-root aeration tubes into the soil surface and run a hose or bubbler line into the tube. The purpose of using root aeration tubes is to deliver both water and oxygen to the deeper soil below the tree. One popular design uses PVC plastic pipes with cross-drilled holes that provide the opening into the soil for aeration.

On Monday, the RNC Committee on Arrangements announced that the Florida delegation will be at the Innisbrook Resort in Palm Harbor, nearly 32 miles from the Tampa Bay Times Forum.
On the other hand, Obama's fundamental beliefs are a legitimate issue. Even after he's served a term as president, they're not clear, at least to me. But they're clear to many in talk-radio land, based on his association with the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. (his former pastor in Chicago) and Bill Ayers (a former authentic violent revolutionary, who called for blood and got it, now playing the more cuddly role of a harmless aging radical). These are characters left over from 2008.

The endemic corruption is one reason many analysts think China faces a period of political instability as it consolidates the fantastic economic gains of recent years. As prosperous as the new China may appear, it's also riddled with networks of corrupt power and privilege – and managed by a nervous elite that is transferring ill-gained loot to foreign bank accounts before it gets caught.

In the more attention-grabbing moments of this year's "My Head Is an Animal," these Icelandic folk-rockers approach the wide-screen grandeur of an Arcade Fire or the Bright Eyes of "Lifted" (although the comparison of choice for the moment appears to be Mumford & Sons).

A course for U.S. military officers has been teaching that America's enemy is Islam in general, not just terrorists, and suggesting that the country might ultimately have to obliterate the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina without regard for civilian deaths, following World War II precedents of the nuclear attack on Hiroshima or the allied firebombing of Dresden.
