Talk about pains in the neck . . . this sounds to us like cervical spine arthritis (cervical spondylosis), not heart trouble. Cervical arthritis attacks the top vertebrae in your spine -- seven bony segments in your neck, separated by shock-absorbing cartilage cushions. Severe damage can inflame nerves in your spinal cord, shooting pain from your neck down your arms. It's often aggravated by an old back injury.

Sripal's salary is listed as $114,014 in the 2009-2010 official state manual. But Missouri's online financial tracker shows he actually was paid more than $300,000 in both of those years. His total wages ballooned over his base salary because physicians at the Farmington facility get an extra $80 an hour when they serve as the onsite, on-call doctor on nights and weekends. Sripal was paid for more than 2,500 hours of nights and weekends last fiscal year, according to department records.
Uribe, sore left wrist and all that kept him out of the starting lineup, entered at shortstop in the top of the ninth. He immediately picked up a hard one-hopper by pinch-hitter Ross Gload in the hole and made a strong throw while falling away for the out.

Arriving in June 2002, the competition (spun off from the UK hit "Pop Idol") hardly took TV by storm. Fewer than 10 million viewers tuned in for the premiere. But by the time Kelly Clarkson was crowned that September, viewership had surged to 23 million, and "Idol" hasn't looked back.
When combined with other charges - for providing the RAL in cash, or transferring it to a high-fee prepaid card - the cost of the RAL can approach loan-shark levels. During last year's tax season, Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc. was blocked from selling RALs after the Office of the Comptroller of Currency prohibited the company's bank from financing the program. In December, federal regulators similarly cut off RAL lending for H&R Block Inc., the nation's biggest tax-prep firm.
The Bug's Life project is budgeted at $826,000. A property tax-funded grant from the Developmental Disabilities Resource Board of St. Charles County will cover $250,000.

The woman, 30-year-old Sandra Fluke, a law student at Georgetown University, wants the Catholic school to pay for contraceptives in its insurance policy because, she says, she and her friends cannot afford the cost otherwise. Apparently Ms. Fluke is not aware that contraceptive pills, according to John McCormack of The Weekly Standard, "can be purchased for as low as $9 per month at a pharmacy near Georgetown's campus." Or that some places dispense them for free, along with condoms.
Spending a few days in Alex's shoes is wearying, from the school bus ride where he's regularly threatened and pummeled (these are the scenes that caused most of the uproar with the ratings board, and they have been left intact) to telling his parents about the indignities he suffered that day. You can just about comprehend how a kid might choose suicide at a certain point, especially after Alex mutters, "I'm starting to think I don't feel anything anymore."

The New York-based alliance argues that Perdue shares responsibility with the Hudsons for manure from their chicken houses that allegedly washed off the farm, because the company owns the Cornish game hens raised there.

Weeks after selling his home in Oklahoma City in a buyer's market and purchasing a new one in Oregon, Cho was ousted in a move that blindsided him and most in the organization. It was like the movie Groundhog Day, with Cho and Pritchard alternating in the role of Bill Murray's character.

Final reason: there's less pressure on the Cards. Nobody thought they'd get here, and the majority don't think they'll win. The burden of expectations lies on the Rangers. The Cards have been free of that burden for seven weeks, and they're playing .700 ball over that span.

Rachel Bonds’ “Anniversary” depicts the uneasy courtship between a kind young man (Jerry Richardson) and a lonely woman (Julie Fitzpatrick) still mourning the death of her lover.

Paul Silas is out as coach of the Bobcats, who finished 7-59 and with the worst winning percentage in NBA history (.106). The Bobcats are young and lacking a clear superstar talent, which could change in the coming draft. But whoever replaces Silas is only going to be as good as the roster allows, which means as good as the pingpong balls fall. Rick Pitino would have been a lot better coach with the Celtics had they been able to draft Tim Duncan, right? … The Brooklyn Nets unveiled their black and white color scheme and logos, paying homage to the old Brooklyn subway signs. Part owner and hip-hop legend Jay-Z was apparently the lead designer. … David Stern tells ESPN radio's Colin Cowherd that the wear and tear from a condensed NBA season has nothing to do with an uptick in injuries (Derrick Rose, Dwight Howard, Iman Shumpert to name a recent few). Rose was, after all, well rested before tearing his ACL Sunday, Stern said. Yeah, Rose had missed a third of the season with other nagging leg injuries. There's no way to know for sure about the potential cause and effect, but the more injuries, the more it's going to be questioned.

Times, and technology, have changed. While waiting for a transplant, many patients' hearts are outfitted with left ventricular assist devices – pumps that help the ailing organ do its job. Cheney reportedly had one implanted at Inova back in 2010. The devices have become advanced enough that they can increasingly be used as a lifelong solution in and of themselves rather than as a bridge to an eventual heart transplant.
Is it really so hard to imagine why a person would be opposed to that?
But because Lemay qualified for the state flood assistance, the county's Port Authority applied for a grant from the state Department of Economic Development - thus freeing up the county to spend the casino money on freight incentives.

To me, Santa is a representative of all things Christmas almost as much as the birth of Jesus. He's a jolly fellow that travels throughout the world during one magical night of gift giving and cookies. No, I've never seen him. No, I don't know if he really lives at the North Pole or flies through the air in a sleigh pulled by airborne reindeer. But I have faith in him just as I have faith in God.

Eden Bower Lane, 10:12 a.m.: A vehicle was burglarized; a purse was stolen.
These minor omissions do not detract from the wonderfully rich sense of Anne's personality and preoccupations conveyed in "Against Wind and Tide." While the five previous volumes, edited by Anne in the 1970s, delved deeply into periods of a few years, this one covers four decades of growth and change. We see her coming to understand that Charles' absences were necessary for him while matter-of-factly voicing her feelings of being "abandoned and put upon." She learned to make her own plans and firmly refused to adjust them to his last-minute demands. She continued to be grateful for the worlds he had opened up for her while realizing she had worlds of her own to explore.
I'm not sure I understand why Busch is declaring that his company is not a craft brewery; until it brews 6 million barrels a year or starts using adjunct ingredients, that's exactly what it

Bootleggers abound in John Hillcoat's film about Depression-era Franklin County, Va. The authorities want a cut. Tom Hardy, Shia LaBeouf and Guy Pearce star. Sounds pretty swell. We used to live there and can vouch for the area still producing excellent moonshine. Or so we have heard.

When the Peoria Sports Complex opened in 1994, Peoria, Ariz., was barely a blip on the map, and it initiated the league's movement into the West Valley. It's 11 miles from Camelback Ranch and is home to the San Diego Padres, the Dodgers' fierce rivals, and the could-be-fearsome Seattle Mariners.

The secret to savings is threefold: First, do as much of the work yourself as you're qualified to do and you'll save a bundle on labor. Second, choose faux finishes instead of granite, tile or marble. The latest versions of laminate and higher-end vinyl are hard to tell from the real thing. Third, focus on finishes, accessories, paint and maintenance - affordable items that can make your bathroom look sharp without the huge cost of replacing the major pieces, such as the toilet and tub.

Kennedy Airport in Queens; the George Washington Bridge Bus Station in Upper Manhattan; the Port Authority Technical Center in Jersey City; the Port Ivory/Howland Hook container terminal in Staten Island.
The lawsuit also challenges whether patient information should be available to tax regulators or law enforcement, not just the health department. Advocates say that because the constitutional amendment passed by Colorado voters in 2000 described a "confidential state registry" maintained by the health department, others in government shouldn't be able to see who is using pot.
"The numbers are not realistic, especially with the economy the way it is," Dunn said. "It's important to have businesses that are viable, and we have a lot of great places already."
Peditto said Maryland hunters should appreciate that the available wildlife-management areas to pursue their passion have nearly doubled from 60,000 acres to 112,000 acres, and that public hunting lands have also increased to about 500,000 acres. In the mid-1950s, only about 15,000 deer were killed by hunters; last year it was about 100,000.

I wish I could have been there last night when District Attorney Tony Rackauckas got home and his young son asked him, "Daddy, why are you holding up boxes of Saran Wrap on the TV news?" Because without a script, I'm sure he fumbled out something like, "Uh, Saran Wrap is a legally trademarked name, son. It wasn't Saran Wrap. Eat your carrots."

The accident occurred around 11 a.m. Monday. The driver, 76, of Bloomfield Hills, told police she was attempting to park when her foot slipped and hit the accelerator on her 2011 Buick LaCrosse. Nobody was injured, which was especially fortunate since moments before the crash two people were standing in the area where the car finally landed.
Unfortunately, eyebrows were also being raised elsewhere. According to reports, a Brazilian journalist, Lúcia Guimarães, posted a story on her blog regarding a well-known Brazilian song that appears extensively in the second movement of a string quartet by Golijov, again without crediting the composers. The journalist reported that Golijov withdrew and reworked the movement, pulling the questionable melody.

Parker told jurors that the three women expected to testify that they survived Sowell’s attacks certainly had sad stories to tell.

"In addition to the men's team, I inherited one player, Mallory Cummings, who is the team captain for the women. They've given me the directive to build as many as 20 players on both teams, so I've hired Dustin Schilling to help me out with the men's team and Kathy Schaeffer will help out with the women's team."
The work was a commission by the L.A. Phil. Gustavo Dudamel gave the premiere in Disney in 2009. At the Seoul Philharmonic's appearance Wednesday in Santa Barbara, "Su" and "Mother Goose" had replaced the "Pathétique" on the program. It doesn't usually happen that way, but I suspect the Santa Barbarans got the better deal. Thursday's large, stylish, attentive and enthusiastic Disney audience, however, may not have felt that way.

Tancredo said the state should roll back Medicaid eligibility to 2007 levels, something that would be prohibited by the new federal health care law. Even rolling eligibility back to levels permitted under the law might not save the state any money, because the most recent expansion in eligibility was funded by a fee paid by hospitals and then matched by federal dollars.

In the vaguest of terms, there's a similarity to Rowling's saga. Morgenstern's novel also centers on two dueling magicians, one of whom is difficult to pin down by name. The pawns in their odd, extended game are several sweet, young innocents who struggle to uncover their own destinies just like Harry and his friends. And the drama takes place among an interesting assortment of characters populating the Cirque des Rêves, which does seem, a little, like Hogwarts.

The Shaker Heights visit was Obama's 16th to Ohio since taking office in January 2009. While the event was billed as an official presidential visit to discuss the economy, there was some political calculus to the timing of his swing-state appearance.
The obvious reason that the artistic logic of making the best product possible is largely ignored is money.

Mulally's comments weren't offered as a criticism of Romney. Rather, he was defending Ford's decision to go to Congress with GM and Chrysler in 2008 to call for a federal rescue. Ford didn't need the money itself -- it had previously arranged a multibillion-dollar line of private credit. But Mulally said he believed then, just as he believes now, that GM and Chrysler threatened to drag the entire country into a depression.
DG: Whiting received some consideration for the club's Pitcher of the Year Award within in the Cardinals' front office. He started the year in the bullpen but emerged to be the most consistent starter for Low-A Quad Cities. Was the best prospect in that rotation? No, Carlos Martinez was to start the year and Trevor Rosenthal was to finish it. But you could call Whiting the ace of the group. He is the latest control pitcher to succeed at that level, following P.J. Walters and Trey Hearne, to name two. Folks I've spoken to believe Whiting's stuff is a tick better, and that will have to be true for him to ascend. Boone has command of three pitches, he operates in that 88-91 mph area, and he has what's advertised as a true swing-and-miss slider. That last trait will serve him well as he advances, and it does feed the notion that relief work could be in his future. Right now, he'll stay as a starter because of his mix of pitches and his ability to fit them into the edges of the strike zone. It makes sense for him to be on the same "track" as the pitchers he echoes - a steady climb through the system. Hearne had trouble in Class AA. Walters and his changeup had difficulty in the majors. Like those two, Whiting will have to master the level before moving ahead, and his first test will come in Springfield, when he gets there.
"After all, what good is a bankrupted company at generating revenue or employee payroll taxes," Drewniak said. "If, in the correct circumstances, being reasonable in tax enforcement and working with businesses can make for a positive outcome, then we favor that."
This is not the way the story is usually told.
The rose told me that person must have been really loved by someone. After a moment of thought, I knew who had died. There was a little, frail man who worked where the sign stood. He lived next door. He was very plain and very simple. His old clothing said he was not wealthy. He didn’t talk very much, he just told you the price of your purchase. His life seemed uneventful, almost sad. He seemed to be alone and seemed to follow the exact same routine every day. He had a brother next door who is deaf, a sister in law who is deaf, and two adopted nephews who are deaf as well. He seemed to exist for his business and the people who came to enjoy his bread.

But the action is clear and swiftly paced, and the large ensemble does well by both the play’s poetic language and its intense physical demands — one character is killed in a mechanical chair, another starves herself to death and a third robotically continues dancing when hearing that her loved ones are dead. Among the standouts are Andrew Weems’ Bassanes — barking out such lines as, “Hold your chops, nightmare!” and “Furies whip thee!” with entertaining gusto — and Boras, heartbreaking as the doomed bride.

The beetles have reached Mount Hebo, one of the few remaining habitats of the threatened Oregon silverspot butterfly. The beetle thrives in similar environments as does the endangered Fender's blue butterfly in the Willamette Valley.

Gazelle beetles climb shrubs and grasses, unlike their more earth-bound relatives.

The mayor's Partnership for Los Angeles Schools gave them math and literacy coaches, more feedback and the opportunity to watch their more effective peers, said Angela Bass, the group's former superintendent of instruction.
Centeno's food is rustic in the best sense. You can't call it American eclectic or global or any other convenient label, really. He seems to cook more from his palate than his head. That's how he comes up with such vibrant, lush flavors. The plating is very simple. It certainly doesn't seem as if he's spent nights poring over every page of the hyper-stylized Noma cookbook. He's a chef who likes to cook and likes to eat. You don't need to know much more about him than that.
In their suit, Goode and Grant have alleged due-process violations, assault and battery, negligent and intentional infliction of physical and emotional distress, negligent supervision and hiring, defamation and victims' rights violations.

Brickowski said he's studied the parallels between retired athletes and retired military personnel. "I had a high-ranking military officer tell me, 'The higher the ranking, the more difficult the transition.' And that's the same with professional basketball.

Like a skilled batter fouling off pitch after pitch, Novitzky made Hardin work hard out there, standing in the middle of the courtroom for hours on end. Hardin leaned back at one point with his arms folded across his chest, shooting questions at Novitzky, who sat forward in the witness seat, alert as a tennis player who has gone to the net.

"I began to wonder whether this might offer a sliver of hope for American publishers, although more interesting was the notion that these young women were creating an independent literary community.

Today, you can hardly log onto the Web without running across stories detailing the wreckage and waste wrought by the green jobs fantasy. The Solyndra scandal, in which half a billion dollars in loan guarantees was funneled to a now-bankrupt solar panel maker, is still unreeling.

But it's the fraught relationships between the crooks and their molls and/or wives that pad the action and diffuse the film's potential tension. Only Boyd's rocky marriage to the radiant, long-suffering Doreen (an excellent Kelly Reilly) is worth its emotional close-up, despite a stock trajectory.
At ease enough to dispense with "Run" early on in his two-hour set, Nathanson reveled in revisiting all corners of his 15-plus year career - the self-pitying acoustic numbers from the days when he used to play the Brain Wash Cafe-Laundromat on Folsom Street for just three people to the soaring mid-tempo ballads that were played during countless crying scenes of various WB television network dramas.

But by and large, the team hasn't had much luck in the lottery proper or with the players it has drafted as a result. Only once has it actually improved its position, and that was more of technicality. In 2003, Cleveland and Denver tied with the worst records in the league, 17-65, and in a drawing to determine which team would draft first should neither earn one of the top three spots, Denver finished first and Cleveland second. So, technically, the Cavs moved up one spot by winning the lottery.

Though corn and beans are better-known Mexican natives, squash predates them by several thousand years; Maya people domesticated several varieties of squash as early as 8000 B.C. Oils from these seeds were the main source of dietary fat before the Spanish introduced beef and pork. Though the native plants included cucumber, zucchini, patty pan and butternut squash, great quantities of pumpkin — la calabaza grande — defines the Yucatán diet even today. Toasted, ground pumpkin seeds still appear on menus even more than the flesh.

If funding is tied to retention rates, students will learn a false lesson. They will "learn" that the world does make allowances for people. Because, of course, for them it will. You get what you pay for, and if you pay for high retention and graduation rates, that is what you will get.

That story blended in my mind with the one about 12-year-old Michael Green II being shot on a basketball court near his home.

leading scorer in the series for the Blazers with four goals and seven assists, while Jordan DePape has added four goals and five assists. … Carruth surrendered seven goals on 43 shots in Game 6, including three goals on shots from the point. “I think Mac has been good in the series,” Johnston said. “You come out of games like Monday’s game and you can over-examine things. But I look at the goals and there’s nothing that was his fault. It’s funny how sometimes point shots hit a shin pad and bounce to the left or to the right, and sometimes they find their way through. Monday night was one of those nights where they found their way through.”

The West Portal strip has plenty of grown-up attractions - in the form of friendly neighborhood pubs. And they all have quintessential bar names: The Dubliner, Joxer Daly's and perhaps best of all, the Philosopher's Club. The closest you'll get to mixology in West Portal is a gin and tonic. And in this case, that's a very good thing.

2009 Rock Wall Stagecoach Vineyard Napa Valley Zinfandel ($40, 15.8%): Kent Rosenblum and daughter Shauna certainly know the style their partisans love. Here they've tapped the rocky Stagecoach site for a no-holds-barred expression. Intense, lusty cinnamon wood notes, with blackberry jam and a sweet licorice tone. Not subtle, but rewarding. As one taster put it, "This is the wine that will make you do something stupid." Hope not.
Standing from quite literally the heights of basketball glory, you are reminded that the struggle of a hall-of-famer — surely one of days, hours, and years spent trying to learn and understand the game, of hard lessons learned both on and off the court — is shared by all lifetime basketball-lovers. In this sense, the Honors Ring spotlights the people who best represent, not own, the game's legacy.

The French believe they have a right to pleasure and are highly tolerant of their fellow citizens' private behavior. They don't seem to mind that President Nicolas Sarkozy and his stunning pop star wife, Carla Bruni, have had affairs and they weren't too distressed when the culture minister wrote openly of patronizing young male prostitutes abroad. While Americans have "proved time and again that they see a politician's cheating in marriage as tantamount to cheating on the voters and the country," the French "do not enjoy ugly revelations that disturb the surface and threaten the social fabric," Sciolino writes. In fact, male politicians are expected to exude virility as proof that they are able to handle the job. President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky was praised by even right-wing French politicians as a sign that he was a healthy male.
A The lanes have not been narrowed and are the standard 12 feet wide.

A That certainly I have done on purpose. I like records that have kind of a homemade feel about them so you can hear the human beings at work on them. I think it makes the general public quite nervous. The other reason is that a lot of people who listen to my records are people in the business -- other musicians and producers and people like that. They never buy my records; they get them free. But the payback is I can pick up a cover song if I don't overpolish my stuff. That's how I make my living, is people cover my songs.
ConocoPhillips idled one plant last year and Sunoco Inc. closed another and announced plans to close a third. Losing all three means a drop in production of 700,000 barrels daily, Laskoski said.

Western Kentucky loses coach's debut
Church spokeswoman Kim Farah says it is merely emphasizing concern for keeping families together.
There are lots of ways the answer could go. The question put to SLU coach Rick Majerus is, how has sophomore guard Mike McCall gotten better? All of a sudden, everywhere you look on the court, McCall's making a key contribution, whether it's taking care of the ball, passing the ball, shooting the ball, guarding the ball, guarding someone without the ball. All are areas where McCall has stood out in the past four weeks. And the answer is … none of the above.
Obviously there isn’t a 1:1 correlation of everyone who is really into shooting games being a homicidal lunatic. Anders Breivik probably has a lot of hobbies, and someone sharing those hobbies doesn’t make them more or less likely to commit such a horrible, violent crime.

Those numbers are commendable to be sure, but even more so are the driving dynamics I enjoyed while obtaining them. In the smaller Nissan Versa, for example, I averaged a very good 38.3 mpg, but that car was about as flavorful as cottage cheese. In the revamped and very well thought-out Hyundai Elantra, which is also rated at up to 40 mpg highway, I averaged 31.3 mpg. Even the latest Honda Civic I drove didn't match that, returning an observed 32.7 mpg with a less-powerful engine.

Bears comeback against Bombers
I was reading Jim Fox's column this morning. I really enjoy his comments, but he forgot one important game we used to play in the alley, and I'm surprised it went past him. It's called "bottle caps." Maybe he was from the more affluent neighborhood that didn't have taverns on the corner. We played around Cherokee and Iowa. There was a tavern on every corner, and we used to go around collecting bottle caps. Then there were guys who could throw the bottle caps, and we hit them with a broomstick. We had the same rules as corkball. But he forgot that.

"The calls were coming in from everywhere, distant places," he said. "We thought, 'What in the world is happening?' "
Russo and his willing confederates deserve whatever punishment they receive from the federal courts. But they leave behind much collateral damage that can be repaired only through an end to the virtual one-party rule by Cuyahoga County Democrats that enabled Russo and his cronies to thwart any realistic checks and balances for so long, and an even more diligent house-cleaning of county government than the one already under way as part of charter reforms voters enacted last year.

Once your pop-culture legacy has cross-pollinated with the Kennedys, you're branded forever. You become inescapably embroiled in too-many-to-count conspiracy theories, sordid memoirs and bad TV movies.

"The bottom line is we're 0-3 in the league," 10th-year coach Mark Richt said. "We've never been there. We've had enough issues off the field that have been a big distraction and sad for our young men and our program and for our university and our fans and everybody else.

Tom Leuhrs, president of the St. Francis Center, which provides shelter and services for the homeless, said the message of compassion is not getting through to those on the streets.
I shudder to think of the time when I have children and they are old enough to drive.

Restaurants with tablecloths are practically an endangered species in L.A. Here, tables are draped in white cloths, which does a lot to tamp down the noise level.

Hands shot up when Raimi asked them to describe the music, and they nailed the Shostakovich piece, written in response to the fire-bombing of Dresden, as communicating “fighting,” “tragedy” and “danger.” At the end of the program, which also included demonstrations of string instruments’ varied sounds, the kids treated the musicians to boisterous rhythmic clapping and colorful works of art they’d made as gifts.
Minutes later, Uddin pulled her car onto the side of Hwy 52. Video shows his next frantic two minutes as he grabs at several passing cars in the northbound lane, then hops the median, running in front of four oncoming cars before stepping in front of the slowing semi.
