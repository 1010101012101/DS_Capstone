Brown's plan is not perfect, and parts of it may not even be legal. It would create a separate pension program for future employees that, among other things, would raise the retirement age for collecting full benefits from 55 to 67 for non-public safety workers. The new plan would also shift some retirement funds into 401(k)s and end the practice of pension "spiking," in which unused vacation time artificially inflates pension payouts.

Artsies in Portland seldom utter the word "gallery" without preceding it with "commercial"—reminiscent of the way people in Southern California used to say "snow skiing." Portland's art galleries—at least the ones I sampled in the Pearl District—have more of a goods-for-sale vibe than the feeling of standing up for particular aesthetics. In size and plain-white-cubeness, the Elizabeth Leach Gallery most closely resembles a serious New York or Los Angeles gallery. Charles A. Hartman Fine Art and PDX Contemporary Art, both recommended to me as standard-bearers, offered fairly conservative painting (respectively, Eva Speer's realist chunks of ocean garnished at the edges with "unfinished" skeins of combed paint, and the twee veggies of Tina Beebe's "Of Gardens" exhibition). Both shows were quite respectable but hardly as weirdly compelling as Ralph Pugay's wickedly faux-naive little pictures (one title, "Chicken Pox Orgy," should convey the flavor) at a funky place on the north side called Rocksbox—which is, naturally enough, yet another alternative space.
Preppy Hamptons chic has finally arrived with the opening of Roberta Freymann's eponymous boutique on Fillmore Street.

There's also a colorful assortment of accessories like beaded clutches in playful patterns, lightweight beach totes, and checked blue or red scarves with a pom-pom border of cotton tassels that add a layer of fun. The 650-square-foot space, painted a sunny orange with contrasting black wooden floors and ornate features, captures the essence of Freymann's aesthetic and transports shoppers to a warm South or East Hampton beach. Jewelry such as the Beaded Bib, a sparkly necklace that's exclusive to the Fillmore location, can spice up a daytime outfit or pair with a contrasting kurta.

Cutting US forces to 300 deployed warheads — a level that experts say we haven’t seen since the early 1950s — might force us to alter our strategic doctrine. Right now, that’s a “counterforce” policy — we target opposition-nuclear forces. A smaller force might require us to put “countervalue” targets, that is, large population centers, in the crosshairs.

If there was a best way to stop smoking, everyone would do it and no one would be smoking! So while there is no best way to stop smoking, there are better ways. Studies have shown that with each additional support component added to a person's quit plan, it is more likely that they will succeed. Combination therapies are increasingly becoming standard of care (nicotine patch and lozenge or gum, other medications and nicotine replacement products) along with supportive coaching — individual, in a group, online or phone quit-line. Every quit plan may have common elements, but it really needs to be suited to the individual. With Freshstart, we work with each person to create his or her own quit plan featuring the elements best suited for them.

Even vegetarian dishes showcase this bold approach, including the vegan delight ($5), with its miso broth smoky with shiitake mushrooms and filled with silken mushroom dumplings. Taiwanese eggplant ($8) consists of fat slices of the vegetable, plus whole leaves of basil and three types of garlic. Again his technique shines: Thick slices are brined, and when it comes time to stir-fry the eggplant, the hot oil doesn't soak in but draws out the salt water. He then dunks the vegetables in boiling water and quickly sautes them with chile oil and garlic, producing a light but assertive dish. It's a technique he says he learned at Farina.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. There are the medical dangers of football in general caused by head trauma over repetitive hits. There is the false concept of the football student-athlete that the NCAA endlessly tries to sell, when any major college player will tell you that the demands of the game, a year-round commitment, makes the student half of the equation secondary and superfluous. There are the scandals that have beset programs in the desperate pursuit of winning—the University of Southern California, Ohio State University, University of Miami and Penn State University among others.

* One hopeful sign for Pujols: his line-drive rate is very healthy so far. His line-drive rate of 24.4 percent is up about 7 points from where he was in 2010 and 2011.

His batting average on balls in play is .256 That's low for Pujols, who had .315 career average on balls in play before this season. The luck factor is working against him in the early days of 2012. That luck certainly can change.

One story, which he encouraged in numerous interviews, was that he arrived in a hot-air balloon. Soon he heard a message and began erecting a cross. Mixing water and hay, he put a facade on the mountain, then painted it with religious messages and motifs.
Interesting that Amar’e Stoudemire came to New York without Carmelo Anthony or Jeremy Lin and had fans chanting “MVP...MVP.”
The East-West Gateway Council of Governments, the region's designated planning agency, recently endorsed the plan. If both the County Council and the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission give their approval, which they should, then work on phase three could begin in late 2012 or early 2013, with completion possibly by the end of 2014.
Fingerprint foul-up: In 2004, FBI mistakes led the bureau to detain Portland-area lawyer Brandon Mayfield, a Muslim it suspected of leaving a fingerprint on a bag of detonators found near the wreckage of commuter trains blown up by terrorists in Madrid, Spain. Agents jailed Mayfield for two weeks on a material witness warrant after his name was leaked to the news media. But when Spanish investigators linked the fingerprint to an Algerian national, Mayfield was released and the FBI apologized. Mayfield later sued the FBI, which settled the case for $2 million.

Ms. Ruksana, 5-foot-2-inches, was herself born in the countryside outside Jodhpur. She completed the fifth grade before her father pulled her out of school to help with chores.
Banks rightly realized there were enough sociological issues loaded into that boy's declaration to fill a book. As he puts it: "Over the past half century, African Americans have become the most unmarried people in our nation. By far. We are the least likely to marry and the most likely to divorce; we maintain fewer committed and enduring relationships than any other group. Not since slavery have black men and women been as unpartnered as we are now."
The minutes were Redd's first in 14 months after he endured his second major reconstructive knee surgery.
Traders punished Apple after AT&T said it activated far fewer of Apple's iPhones. Apple fell 2 percent, dragging the Nasdaq composite average to a lower close. Apple shares recovered the day's losses several times over in after-hours trading after the company announced another record quarterly profit that easily beat analysts' forecasts.
Cassie, who attended Blackhurst before it closed, was trying to encourage her sister as she showed her around.
The play "exposes the underside of creating theater, and it is both hysterically ridiculous and funny at moments but also surprisingly moving. Theresa understands what draws us to this art form, sometimes like lemmings, but also what this crazy life style gives back to us," says Amy Glazer, an old hand at Rebeck ("Seducing Charlie Barker") who is directing "Understudy" at the Rep. "It explores why we choose the theater as a lifestyle and why some of us are so addicted to it."
“The reason I say that, we don’t know what the incidence is of people who are still alive walking around with this condition,’’ said Gunson. “There may be several people who escaped what happened to Fred. They might not have exercised as hard. Who knows why? It’s really hard, because you can’t do that kind of study.’’
"Key worked very hard with the parties involved to avoid foreclosure," a KeyBank spokeswoman said in an e-mailed statement. "Because of the recent foreclosure actions taken by others, Key has no choice but to assert and foreclose on its interests in the Avenue project. We have not yet filed our answer and cross claim and are therefore not at liberty to reveal specific client information."
Stanford and San Jose State also will compete.
LLC of Creve Coeuer, the lead developer, will want to bear the entire cost of land acquisition, roads, sewers and utility lines. Altus and its partners would be competing against subsidized developments elsewhere. They're going to want subsidies, too.
The Indians started spring training on Feb. 20 with pitchers and catchers reporting. That's 43 days of nothing but baseball, but in actuality it was longer. Players such as Jeanmar Gomez came to Goodyear in late January to begin training. For Gomez the extra work was worth it because he won a job in the rotation as the fifth starter.
The statement was given to police at 10:35 p.m. Jan. 8 in the Port Authority Administration Building at the airport.
Physicians at Madigan have been overwhelmed, many soldiers say, by the flood of troops returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan looking for help. Behavioral health visits rose sharply in 2010 to 101,000 from 93,000 the previous year and then increased again in 2011.
News of the departures came the day after federal agents charged the county's former Chief Information Officer Tahir Kazmi, 52, of Rochester Hills with extortion, theft and obstruction of justice.

Their experiences -- even the apparent contradiction of some of their actions -- show the bigness of the challenges and the fragility of the people involved. We will not go into details about why they came into the system out of respect for their privacy.
That call is the province of league vice president of basketball operations Stu Jackson, and Mickael Pietrus at first steered clear of remarking on that process.
It was a year ago in Seattle that then-junior point guard Nia Jackson suffered a season-ending knee injury, one which she has been haunted by for most this season. But Jackson told the Register-Guard this week that she finally feels good, and that is key for the Ducks as they try to ramp up their pace heading into the final few weeks of conference play. Now you combine do-everything forward Amanda Johnson with freshman bruiser Liz Brenner, and the Ducks could become even more of a nightmare to guard.
On his blog last month, malpractice lawyer Alan J. Belsky said the case will be "ever so closely" watched as it develops.
"Westbrook's numbers against right-handers are far worse than they are against left-handers," he explained beforehand. "So it's kind of one of those days to get these guys some at-bats."
Nothing takes the place of simply hearing the story of Jesus' birth read aloud. Luke, for example, offers a poignant image of families traveling to be together in response to a government edict. Although scholars debate what Luke actually meant by "there was no place for them in the inn," the image of families double bunking and sleeping on floors resonates with anyone who has spent the night on grandma's pull out sofa. Hearing the story of a baby cradled in a young mother's arms, only to be visited by religious outcasts such as shepherds stirs the hearts of those yearning for good news of great joy. A singing Christmas tree may get our toes to tapping, but it is the promise of God in human flesh that makes our hearts glow.
After reviewing the results, regulators reprimanded Wasemiller but allowed him to keep working if he accepted certain restrictions on his practice and attended various courses, including family practice medicine and pain management. Wasemiller failed to comply. In November, the board suspended his license indefinitely, which means Wasemiller cannot practice in Minnesota without petitioning the board for reinstatement.

Christians celebrate Christmas with trees, candles, and home decorations. Jews celebrate Chanukah with an 8 branch candelabrum and now with parties, feasting, and singing. Zoroastrians observe the birth of the sun by lighting fires and feasting with friends. Hindus celebrate Diwali with lights and food, and both atheists and agnostics decorate trees, light candles and go to parties. Millions of African Americans celebrate Kwanzaa with its own set of seven candles.

Kowroski remains a ponderous lump, however, wasting this display of heroism. Ramasar and sprightly Tiler Peck are given nothing interesting to do, and during all this nonsense “L’Arlésienne” seems to be playing in another room.
Those pieces -- part of an "Art ReMix" program designed to spark new perspectives on art history -- have now migrated to other galleries. But visitors will still find Minnesota artist JoAnn Verburg's panoramic photos of misty Italian groves among the Chinese porcelain, and a modernist abstraction by painter David Reed with the Baroque paintings.
At this time of the year, bears come out of their winter dens hungry and before their natural food sources are available. Bears then turn to bird feeders, garbage, pet food and even barbecue grills for food.

Biology and baseball are widely different pursuits, but both benefit from copious, thoughtful data gathering. We should keep in mind that the data we collect today could someday bear fruit when analyzed in currently unimagined ways. As with biological data, honest, precise and complete baseball data will help extend the limits of human physiology and anatomy -- and perhaps allow some future Sandy Koufax to throw another legendary game.

Turner vowed to soldier on against what she called "The Club."
The American kabuki dance known as the Congressional supercommittee has ended where it started, with no deal on cutting $1.2 trillion from the federal deficit. What it has mostly accomplished is to underscore why public approval of Congress as a whole is mired at a ludicrous 9 percent in the polls.
TriQuint, which makes wireless chips for Apple's iPhone and other popular mobile devices, lacked the capacity to meet rising demand last year and turned away some business. When Apple issued the Verizon iPhone early this year, TriQuint's chips were absent.
At Ford, the UAW is optimistic it can reach an agreement by weeks end. UAW President Bob King and UAW Vice President Jimmy Settles met with the company on Tuesday and bargaining sessions are expected to continue until a deal is reached.
But those sites and others like them don't often look at the issues in Kansas City's back yard. Like the cable news stations and talk radio shows that steer the majority of the country's political discourse, they build their audience on the national topics that affect the biggest numbers of people.
Apple sold 1.1 million more iPhones over the next three months. The volume has only increased as Apple has released new versions of the phone in a growing number of countries and software developers have created add-on programs, or "apps," that do everything from online banking to mapping bike rides using GPS. In the most recent quarter, Apple sold 8.7 million iPhones.
An unforgettable Labor Day gathering marks the perfect end to a great summer spent hanging out at the beach or on a Beverly Hills patio. Hosting a fire foods party is an ideal option for this special celebration because it pairs delicious yet easy–to–prepare dishes with a relaxed, casual atmosphere that makes guests feel instantly at home. Inviting party-goers to choose their own skewer ingredients and cook them together over an open flame creates a laid–back atmosphere — and offers a simple solution for catering to different diets and appetites. A few irresistible recipes from renowned San Francisco chef Joey Altman paired with an assortment of high–quality dishes and accessories are all it takes to set the stage for this memorable outdoor meal soaked in the California sun.

WASHINGTON -- Under fierce election-year fire, President Barack Obama on Friday abruptly abandoned his stand that religious organizations must pay for birth control for workers, scrambling to end a furor raging from the Catholic Church to Congress to his re-election foes. He demanded that insurance companies step in to provide the coverage instead.

From U.S. 1, on the mainland, it's a sharp left (west) to U.S. 41, the Tamiami Trail, and a delightful straightaway into the Everglades and Big Cypress National Preserve. This time, instead of riding over the sea we had the sense of riding over a sea of swamp grass, bounded at great lengths by canals off the edges of the highway.
In a report largely focused on Miami football by Yahoo Sports released last August, the booster, Nevin Shapiro, charged that Haith thanked him for a $10,000 payment funded by Shapiro. The payment allegedly went through an assistant coach, a gift Shapiro said was "required" by a family member of prospect DeQuan Jones to secure his commitment to Miami.

Rumor is James will leave Oregon early to enter the 2012 draft, but he still has a lot to prove. He's super quick and elusive and has great instincts, but he's small. A big Rose Bowl performance is a must if he hopes to be drafted before the third round.
Christian Lopez caught the ball from Derek Jeter's 3,000th hit -- a home run -- and thumbed his nose at everything this country stands for in 2011 by giving the souvenir to Jeter.He could've tried to sell it to the Yankees' shortstop. He could've put it up for bid on the Internet. He could've used the money to pay off college loans believed to exceed $100,000.

Weinstein got to brag about getting a PG-13 without cutting a crucial scene that contained three F-bombs (two more than are typically allowed without triggering an automatic R), while MPAA ratings maven Joan Graves could say that the system worked by pointing to the edits that were made in the film.
When I took the opportunity to scan the 599 bills signed into law this year by the governor, since I had been in a coma most of January and likely missed some issues during my time down, I found the following nugget: The governor signed into law Senate Bill 522, sponsored by Sen. Bruce Starr, R-Hillsboro. The bill authorizes the court to terminate the parental rights of a person convicted of first- or second-degree rape with respect to a child conceived as a result of that rape.
"It's very hard to clean up" problematic police questioning with the subpoena, said Dennis Jay Kenney, a professor at John Jay College and former police officer. "You can try to tidy up, but it's pretty hard to do. Once the mistakes are made, it's pretty hard to get yourself out of them that way."
The franchise that started off 13 years ago with five sex-crazed teenagers and one badly treated pastry is back, this time for a high school reunion movie. And although it ends with hints of sequels, the series should simply end, period.
She was 7 when her dad took her to get a haircut, and Makenzie held out a book of hairstyles and asked if she could get her hair cut like this. She was pointing to a boy who had an Opie Taylor haircut.
Kasich joked that he would like a cameo role in the film, but not as a superhero.
I truly wonder what is to become of our state when our legislators seem to prefer to argue cultural issues for the sake of argument, or to proclaim their willingness to reject federal laws and federal money rather than work toward common-sense revenue measures that would enhance the common good for our citizens. I am bewildered.
Among the dieters who lost at least 10% of their body fat, joining a weight loss program was helpful too. The researchers speculate that “the structure of being in a program” was useful in and of itself, even though many such programs involve eating specially prepared foods (a strategy that, on its own, did not help obese people in this study).
A board member "didn't recognize the name and neither did any of her friends," said Jim Washburn, a writer who covers pop music in Orange County and became friends with Phebus.

"I am horrified by the senseless attack on Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and members of her staff," newly elected House Speaker John Boehner said. "An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve. Acts and threats of violence against public officials have no place in our society. Our prayers are with Congresswoman Giffords, her staff, all who were injured, and their families. This is a sad day for our country."

Tim Scavo asserted that this type of test won't prove anything. He said: "The Lord will not submit Himself to anyone's science experiment, or to any scientist's double blind studies.

“It’s nice to see you’re out of jail and doing better,’’ the judge told Chapek.
State lawmakers have already voted to move the primary date to May when it was included among a host of election law changes in House Bill 194.

His meticulous schedule, his exhausting regime, his bike rides up 9W into New York and his runs to the George Washington Bridge have paid off. He placed fifth in his 30 to 34 age group in the Ironman Triathlon race in Lake Placid, N.Y., in July, finishing in 9 hours, 46 minutes. In what amounted to his first marathon, he finished the run in 3 hours, 25 minutes. Now, the rigors of Kona await him. In preparation of the mid-80s heat he will have to endure today, McNeese would crank up the thermostat to 90 in his apartment and get on his stationary bike in bundled layers that were more appropriate for the dark winters he trudged through as well.

The scandal led to the departure of university President Graham Spanier and the dismissal of legendary head coach Joe Paterno after law enforcement officials said they didn't do enough to stop suspected abuse when it was reported to them in 2002.
As much as the Lakers anticipate Denver to react by pushing the pace and resorting to more drive and kicks, they believe Bynum can still replicate that same presence. Should Denver actually take Steve Blake and Devin Ebanks more seriously on the perimeter, well that just opens the lane for Bynum. Plus, Bynum's already learned all the scouting.

Mike Knuble and Jason Chimera scored first-period goals for the Capitals, who will host the next two games of the series. Washington is trying to repeat its first-round feat when it lost the series opener but rallied to beat Boston in seven games. The Capitals have earned four of their five wins in this postseason on the road.
Whatever the cause, that circumstance merely underscores the need for caution when it comes to managing the blue crab population. Better to keep modest restrictions in place now than risk a disastrous decline (or a moratorium on harvest) later.
The murders happened two days after Reginald Brooks was served with divorce papers. Beverly Brooks told the Parole Board she filed for divorce because Reginald Brooks refused to support the family.

The 6-7, 235-pound junior was ticketed for the first round last year after helping LSU win the College World Series. Ranaudo was 12-3 with a 3.04 ERA with 159 strikeouts in 124 innings in 2009, winning Game 3 of the College World Series against Texas.
The diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders have come a long way in recent years. In the past, people who snored might be advised to sew a tennis ball onto the back of their pajama top. The "snore ball" would discourage them from sleeping on their back and might quiet their droning. Or a doctor might use the "dog index" to measure poor sleep: If your dog generally sleeps with you but by morning has left the bed more than half the time, it may be because you're such a loud, restless sleeper that the dog has gone elsewhere for some peace and quiet.

"The era of the middle-class writer who makes $250,000 a script and people like them, they don't necessarily deliver movies but they do a good job and they are pleasant to work with, that's done," said an agent who represents screenwriters and directors but asked for anonymity. "That was the staple writer business 10 years ago."
* Rams rookie defensive end Robert Quinn has been awfully active and disruptive when given an opportunity to play a lot this season. It's really a shame that the Rams didn't fast-forward Quinn's progress by playing him as much as possible this season. It's not as if this team was vying for a playoff spot and couldn't afford a few mistakes made by a rookie player.
Already ahead 2-0, the Cards threatened in the third after Wilson slipped coming off the mound trying to field Rafael Furcal's leadoff bunt and made a poor, backhanded flip that skittered past Moreland. But with runners at the corners, Wilson got Holliday to bounce into a quick double play. Not so surprising, really — Wilson induced the most DP grounders in the majors this year while St. Louis hit into an NL-record 169 double plays.

That would be no great tragedy. It would give the state time to take measure of the gambling program it has and to make any expansion the product of a considered, deliberative process, not 11th-hour deal making.

Nonetheless, in a matchup between Obama and presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney, the groups said the contrast for environmentalists was clear. Romney has called the Environmental Protection Agency "out of control." He has walked back his earlier position that climate change is occurring and that human activity is the prime factor, asserting now that "we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet."

Assuredly, before flood talk began around St. Charles this spring, many residents here didn't know where Gavins Point Dam was. By the end of June, many probably won't forget the far-away dam that was built in 1952 as part of the Flood Control Act of 1944.
The water should be 130 to 150 degrees Fahrenheit, typically the washing machine's hot-water cycle. Then dry using a hot drying cycle. That is germicidal; it actually kills and destroys a lot of vegetative material. It also kills the dust mites. For extra protection, "bleach is excellent. It is probably the cheapest germicide and can be used in a low concentration." Cold water non-bleach bleaches use peroxide, so they're also germicidal.

The question I’d be asking is did the people who recommended Jimenez do so knowing he’d join a contending team as a flag-waving, lead-dog starter to carry them to the postseason this year?

Though they're only a small part of the menu, the pizzas at Gjelina in Venice keep getting better. Six months in, chef-owner Travis Lett has his pizza mojo down. His pies have a graceful aesthetic, beautiful to look at, even better to eat, and farmers market all the way. Like the seductive vegetable dishes here from the wood-burning oven, the eight pizzas on offer shift with the seasons. A pie blanketed in Fontina cheese and bitter greens accented with bacon lardons or one that melds Taleggio cheese with dusky wild mushrooms and pea shoots may give way to a pizza topped with sweet porky guanciale, crushed olives and bufala mozzarella. The crust is very thin, very crisp. Pizza is such a popular item, though, you may have to wait for yours: The oven is only big enough to cook four pies at a time.

And then there's Don (Jon Hamm), who has seemed as happy as he's ever been this season, while also struggling with moments of unease and nightmarish anxiety. It's as though he sensed the dream life he's had with Megan (Jessica Pare), the younger, more loving, effervescently pretty wife Don reached out for, wouldn't last. He discovers, to his obvious dismay, that Megan is dissatisfied, too. Like Pete, she wants something more, but in her case it's to renew her acting career. Like Betty, she isn't content with just being Don's wife. Don tries to say the right thing, to be a modern and supportive husband, but he's unmoored. He sends Megan off to her farewell lunch with the girls from work in the elevator, and then he pushes the elevator button again. The doors open and he looks down into the elevator shaft. He moves away, but the symbolism of the moment can't help but recall the falling-man image in the opening credits and Don's own shoot-your-brains-out metaphors in previous episodes.

In "Raking Light" - indeed, in almost everything ODC performs - what compels the most is the galvanic audacity onstage.

There are sobering revelations aplenty in "Obama's Wars," including intelligence appraisals on Al Qaeda's ongoing effort to recruit terrorists from among the 35 countries whose nationals don't need visas to enter the United States. According to one briefing Obama was given, at least 20 holders of American, Canadian or Western European passports are being trained by Al Qaeda in Pakistani safe havens. Other threats abound: During the last presidential election, for example, U.S. intelligence agencies caught the Chinese hacking into the computers both the Obama and McCain camps used to run their campaigns. When the president-elect got his first private briefing from Adm. Michael G. Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he discovered that eight years into it there was "no strategy" for fighting the Afghan war, that the contingency plan for military action against Iran dated to the Carter administration — a 90-day bombing campaign followed by a Normandy-style invasion by a force larger than the entire U.S. military — and had no plans at all for dealing with the growing Al Qaeda presence in Yemen and Somalia. While no contingency plans exist for dealing militarily with a collapse of nuclear-armed Pakistan, there is "a retribution plan" in place, developed by the Bush administration, if the United States suffers another 9/11-style terrorist attack. That would involve bombing and missile strikes to obliterate the more than 150 Al Qaeda training and staging camps known to exist, most of them in Pakistan, which presumably would suffer extensive civilian casualties.

They have even been applied to the president of the United States. Remember his controversial tarmac meeting with Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer? She said that she "felt threatened" by President Barack Obama, even as the Secret Service and multiple cameras recorded her finger-wagging at him. Her simple allegation was sufficient justification for her aggressive and disrespectful action — with little, if any, repercussions against her.

H.R. 3523 fails to provide authorities to ensure that the Nation's core critical infrastructure is protected while repealing important provisions of electronic surveillance law without instituting corresponding privacy, confidentiality, and civil liberties safeguards.

Moreover, such sharing should be accomplished in a way that permits appropriate sharing within the Government without undue restrictions imposed by private sector companies that share information.

Jacob Bell (St. Louis): It would be an extremely tough sell for Ravens fans to see a Pro Bowl left guard replaced by a member of last year’s Rams offensive line, which allowed young quarterback Sam Bradford to be knocked around on a weekly basis.

His ESPN Insider scouting report says that his quickness and athleticism make him a much better fit in zone blocking schemes, which the Ravens employ. He probably would be a better fit as a veteran backup at this point of his career. Bell reportedly will visit with the Cincinnati Bengals.

The amount of time between issues may also contribute to the paper's award-winning status, Giuliani said, because without a quick turnaround, students are able to delve into the issues and paint an in-depth, comprehensive picture of the news.

However, my park is the American River Parkway. For the past 25 years, I've used it almost every day to ride my bike or to walk. I often pass restrooms that I would not consider using as the stink is horrendous. I ride over rough sections of bike trail that have been marked for repair for months (some finally fixed this summer). I still love being there.

No, they mostly let me do my own thing. Now, me and my great producer, Billy Sherrill, had several disagreements on songs. The biggest was “He Stopped Loving Her Today.” I told him several times I didn’t want to cut that song because it was just too sad. I told him no one would want to hear that, but he persisted and kept bringing it up until I finally gave in, and I am so glad he did.

He never once looked like the tin man in Oz after the rain hit. Maybe that was because the Cavs prepared him for inclement weather with gag presents like a snow shovel and galoshes on his first day in Cleveland. He looked better than expected, fitter and less mechanical than could have been the case after missing 23 games at the end of the season.
Last year, Massey proposed that the state create and oversee investment trusts for the industry, an idea ultimately rejected over concerns it would make the state an active conspirator in federal crimes. Colorado U.S. Attorney John Walsh also criticized that proposal.

Barack Obama won a remarkable two-thirds of the Latino vote in 2008. This year, according to the polls, he's running even stronger among the biggest minority group in the country. If Republicans don't find a way to win more Latino support, Obama will be hard to beat. In the long term, if Latinos become a more-or-less permanent Democratic constituency like African-Americans have, the GOP will inexorably go the way of the Whigs.

Imagine our shock and surprise last month, when we returned from a spring break trip with our children and found trees felled up and down our street. We were “fortunate” that none of our trees were cut down, but our neighbor lost two beautiful trees and another resident down the road lost 67 or more. She can’t even count all the stumps because of the stacked tree trunks.

Authentic Mexican street tacos are a far cry from the shattering hard-shell American version. Instead, warm, soft corn tortillas cradle beef, chicken or fish fillings and come with condiments such as pickled red onions, radishes and lime wedges on the side. No iceberg lettuce, no grated cheese, no tomato-y sauce. Among worthy vendors on both sides of the state line, Taqueria Camecuaro in downtown Kansas City, Kan., is a standout out  and not for the atmosphere. The dining room has all the ambience of an employee break room. But it is large, and there are lots of tables. The menu lists five filling choices for tacos ($1.50 each) or soft-bun tortas ($3.50). Don't miss the al pastor filling made from roasted pineapple and chili-marinated pork. Two fiery-hot hose salsas are offered if you dine in. Unfortunately for your shirt, the chips they are served with are wagon-wheel shaped, fried pork-flavored chips that function more like a sieve than a scoop. Worth checking out in the grocery store and meat market are the chorizo sausage, the giant house-made flour tortillas (perfect for quesadillas on the grill) and  for adventurous eaters  tubs of the restaurants incendiary avocado-tomatillo and roasted red pepper salsas.

But there’d be a silver lining: Findings of test-tampering here might mean our education officials are finally ready to admit that schools may go to great lengths, even cheating, to keep the public from learning just how lousy a job they’re doing.
A heartfelt celebration of caring and kindness filled the Ritz-Carlton ballroom to capacity Nov. 5 for the 35th anniversary of Womankind, a locally grown charity that provides myriad services to pregnant women with limited access to traditional health care. Longtime patrons (many with extended families in tow) turned out in droves to help make the evening a sell-out affair with nearly 400 in attendance. The classy environs provided the perfect backdrop for an evening of live music, luxury auctions and a gourmet dinner. Womankind executive director Eileen Murray said she expected the party to raise $100,000.
“It’s a great time, it was a great day,” said NYSAIS head coach Gerry Stone of Poly Prep. “We did the best we could and kept the strongest kids out there as much as we could but we also had to get everyone in.

Bush was the one who declared that this country would get Bin Laden "dead or alive." Only it didn't happen on his watch, didn't happen until May 1 of last year, didn't happen until Obama gave the order and SEAL Team Six went up those stairs in Pakistan and took the bastard out.

Debates about truth in nonfiction are older than the cases of James Frey and Stephen Glass: Edmund Morris invented a character (himself) in his Ronald Reagan biography, "Dutch," and Truman Capote concocted a comforting last scene for "In Cold Blood." D'Agata and Fingal contribute to the discussion with the format of their book, in which they argue their positions in alternating typefaces. Although D'Agata's essay can get lost amid the commentary, it's fascinating for anyone (at least anyone who works in a newsroom) to watch a fraught back-and-forth about the number of strip clubs in Las Vegas evolve into a treatise about the nature of reality.

A: Our fund generally holds 150 to 200 stocks, because we recognize there's always a risk of default. We've now got more than 200, so if one stock tanks, the impact on the portfolio overall will be minimal. We're obviously screening out all the indicators we can.
