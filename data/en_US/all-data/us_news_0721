The Sixers made the NBA Finals once in Snider's time and lost money in the last handful of years, at least. Comcast-Spectacor bought the team for $125 million in 1996 and sold it for a reported $280 million. The return on his investment, then, was an entirely unspectacular 5.5 percent a year. For comparison's sake, the S&P 500 average grew at 4.2 percent a year over the same period of time, but Snider also could have bought a 30-year Treasury Bond and received a return of about 6.8 percent. Then again, Sixers-as-tenant and Sixers-as-cable programming served other lines on the Comcast-Spectacor ledger quite well, thanks.

Marketing last year from Hyundai takes on some of the new compacts from Ford and GM, whose 40-mpg EPA highway ratings apply only to certain drivetrain variations. For example, only about 1% of Ford Focus or Fiesta listings on Cars.com's national inventory carry the 40-mpg SFE designation. Could the 2013 Dodge Dart, whose 40-mpg variant comes with Fiat's 1.4-liter turbo four-cylinder and a dual-clutch automatic, have the same problem?

Project Manager Doug Decker of the Oregon Department of Forestry said the land will be managed as a "working" forest, including logging. The forest, predominantly young and slow-growing Ponderosa and lodgepole pines, probably won't produce a significant amount of timber for 30 to 40 years. In its sixth decade, the forest is projected to produce about 13 million board feet of timber and $2.8 million in gross revenue annually, according to a state analysis.

Few people bought one loaf. Most bought two. You see, you needed one for dinner and one for the ride home. Arguments took place in the car for “elbows” (the ends).

"They've been on a high the last few weeks, beating Florida in Game 7. To have to step off that plane and take the bus to come here and play, they're riding that high. They've been playing really strong, playing really hard. And, for us, maybe that week off is affecting our play so far... Especially in the last two games they've outhustled us. I think they've won the majority of the battles."

Elsewhere, "Prime Suspect," very loosely based on the Masterpiece Theatre masterpieces with Helen Mirren, is weak (I like Maria Bello but not in this); "Revenge," starring Emily VanCamp and set in the Hamptons, has possibilities; I'm not sure how "Ringer" can be sustained; the new sitcoms with Zooey Deschanel and Christina Applegate didn't hook me although "2 Broke Girls" made me laugh; "Terra Nova" is rather cheesy.

Some frequencies will also be reserved for public safety communications.

By steering the discussion about morality, normally the providence of ethicists and philosophers, away from the symposium and putting it inside the laboratory where thoughts are considered to be not so much conscious choices, but instead reflexes based on a neurological network, Mendez and other neuroscientists are furthering the inquiry into the nature of right and wrong.

Because there is nothing else in life but sports. Everything else sucks. Once, I watched a sports channel from 9 in the morning until 10 at night without a break. I watched every highlight like I never saw it before. Sports are basically our way of feeling sorry for ourselves. Most men can't become athletes. We're watching guys who actually made it. We see them dunking and making touchdowns. Then we think about ourselves when we were younger. My friend Harry wanted to be an athlete, but he never grew tall. Now, he's the guy at the airport who shines shoes, but he loves to watch sports because it reminds him of how he did play in junior high. That was his highlight in life.

As co-curator Constance Lewallen points out, California artists had an edge in humor.
The Dayspring offense, which doesn't get nearly the credit it deserves, made the Rams' comeback difficult and pressured Merino quarterback Wyatt Barber every time he dropped back to pass.

It is fascinating stuff, and there is not nearly enough space here to do it justice, but the salient point is this: Vines is not some godless heathen lobbing bombs at Christianity from outside its walls.

Slow-roasted lamb shoulder ($22.75) is sliced thick atop a creamy potato and green garlic gratin, with baby carrots glazed with honey on one side, and a salsa with chopped almonds and herbs.

Still, there was a sad irony in that Cathleen McCarthy and Joan Lazarus received kudos for their work with the WestWave Dance Festival in a year when harsh economic realities have forced a scaling back of much of the summer festival's performances. Among the literally thousands of artists whom WestWave has brought to the stage were Alex Ketley, Kara Davis, Katie Faulkner and Manuelito Biag, whose collaborative effort "Terra Incognita, Revisited," which debuted last year on a WestWave program, took home top choreographic and company performance honors.

Christmas cactus: This plant is frost-sensitive, so cover during cold snaps, or bring inside. After the holidays, keep the plant inside in a sunny area because the plant will wilt in the heat. Keep in well-drained soil and mist the plant periodically to humidify it. When the top half of the soil is dry, it's time to water. If you hang the plant outside, avoid direct sunlight, which can burn the leaves.
WRIGHT PATMAN: Water stained; 71-76 degrees; 1.01' high. Black bass are good on Texas rigged worms, shallow crankbaits and chatterbaits along main lake points. Crappie are fair on minnows and jigs. Catfish are fair to good on cut shad and prepared bait.
That's the ideal scenario, but not what usually happens, say Cohen and other doctors. A patient goes to a doctor -- usually a primary care physician -- complains of anxiety, and walks out with a prescription for Xanax or Ativan (though many doctors are careful to only prescribe low, short-term doses).
Besides a rehashing of previous performances, a blooper reel, a cataloging of Purrfect the cat's greatest moments and an explanation of the bromance between Blake and Adam, we got NBC cross promotions with SNL's Keenan Thompson imitating Cee Lo and Cee Lo appearing in a pre-taped skit with Amy Poehler and the cast of "Parks and Recreation." We got to see Justin Beiber make good on his threat to return to the show and perform his new single "Boyfriend." Lady Antebellum also performed, as did Hall and Oates, who did "Rich Girl" as though they really didn't want to perform the song ever again. An interesting note, after all the fuss kicked up about Tony Lucca singing "99 Problems" with the b-word. How come Daryl Hall got to say "It's a bitch, girl" several times without NBC insisting they substitute a metaphor of some kind? Well, that was written back in the '70s. Those were more permissive times.
We have also taken the fight to al Qaeda and their allies abroad. In Afghanistan, our troops have taken Taliban strongholds and trained Afghan Security Forces. Our purpose is clear – by preventing the Taliban from reestablishing a stranglehold over the Afghan people, we will deny al Qaeda the safe-haven that served as a launching pad for 9/11.
A: I kind of always had planned on doing it. When I got back to Los Angeles (earlier this year), I was talking to someone on Twitter about training and a couple of my followers were like, "I want to train with you." I've trained probably seven or eight different clients. It's been fun. I'm Type 1 personality so I have to stay in shape. I like people and so that's enjoyable for me. I don't like being inside.
"There is zero question in my mind that we'll get them. Whether it will be this year or next year, I don't have a crystal ball," he said. "We've created hundreds of more jobs for the state and table games will create even more jobs and even more revenue, so they'll do it."
A. Yeah, I don't have as big a stage, thank goodness. But that's a good way to be. It's more fun when it's a real workout. You want to come offstage dripping sweat, and feeling like you did something.

March passenger car sales of 1.4 million were only 4.5% higher than a year ago, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. March was better than January and February, but the quarter's 3.77-million passenger car sales were down 1.3% from a year ago.

Best surprise: Ivan Fischer’s double-duty performance at the Mostly Mozart Festival as conductor and director seemed to come out of nowhere. But leading the Budapest Festival Orchestra in a musically bracing, dramatically sound and visually innovative production of Mozart’s “Don Giovanni,” he impressed on all counts.

He pulled off a small trade early in the season, sending miscasted guard Jerryd Bayless to New Orleans for a protected No. 1 draft pick.

At any rate, his "The Gospel According to Sister Aimee," a four-movement work, 23 minutes long, that recalls the colorful career of the evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson, seemed slapped together, loud and repetitive and not especially inspired. It restlessly searches for grand climaxes and ends up overexerting itself. The musical substance – a blues motif and gospel tune, broken chords, swirls, tone clusters, etude-like sequences – isn't interesting enough to warrant so much repetition. The extensive organ solos, played by Paul Jacobs, were particularly empty.

Next will be stage makeup, and Polly says she is trying for a look that will be "part Emily Strange, part Cleopatra."

And economic realities have conspired to make that balance even harder to achieve: average wages for men have remained flat (and even declined a bit) in recent years; long hours, escalating job demands, greater job insecurity, and boundaries between work and home life that have broken down.

Indeed, many held progressive social views, which caused them to vote less Republican. In fact, in 1992, according to Emory University's Alan Abramowitz, who studies party alignment, 1 out of 6 of such voters defected from the GOP because of its extreme antiabortion position.
When he left the Yankees following the 2007 season it was due to what Torre perceived as a lack of respect from the late George Steinbrenner, who offered him an incentive-laden contract with base salary below what he had been earning.

The move was pretty much a no-brainer after Temple announced it was leaving. Butler's steady success and location in an untapped TV market made it an obvious choice. The only question was whether the increased travel costs would make it worth it for Butler. The decision apparently was that the higher profile - and potential for bigger payouts from the A-10 having more NCAA participants - was worth it.
Young couples still come to get married, and everyone still does a bit of shopping, though even Starbucks looks pained for business these days. For tourists who don't mind the feeling that they are at a convention even when they are not, the tower hotels provide a respectable level of accommodation and service, and as for all that recreational shopping you used to do when on vacation - how many aloha shirts do you need, anyway?

A somewhat milder take on young adult science fiction than "The Hunger Games" — and preceding it by more than a decade — Lois Lowry's "The Giver" reads as though it is aimed at a slightly younger audience than "Hunger." Nonetheless, it exerts a certain discomfiting power in its depiction of a false utopia. It is a numb, homogenized existence. Strict rules about thought and behavior are enforced. Doublespeak is the lingua franca. Extreme emotions are taboo. Sexual urges are repressed with pills. And in return (somehow), the people of this society experience no physical or emotional pain.
Brown had resisted any talk of concessions, demanding that his rivals on the left drop their proposal. But faced with falling poll numbers, Brown's negotiators laid out the governor's terms of a compromise — terms that administration officials say they expected to be rejected.

The Mehlville school board has approved an appropriate districtwide auditorium. It has to work through a sewer pipe situation which they consider to be of no big deal. However, they have no idea what additional costs they may incur. They don't know what type of seats will be included in the auditorium and think because of the limited lobby space that patrons will have to go outside to another building for restrooms and refreshments. This is an appropriate auditorium with final costs not known for the Mehlville School District. We should once again be proud of our school board.

Ease of viewing: Very good. Getting to the beach can be a chore in South Africa, where roads, rails and flights can be unpredictable. But once at the area, there are plenty of beachside accommodations and easy access to the breaks. The town of St. Francis Bay has a Mediterranean feel. The action is close enough to the shore that the casual observer can enjoy it without the aid of binoculars, though you should bring them anyway to get a closer view. There's a surf museum in the Quiksilver shop in town.
I also can understand confusion over the requirements of campaign-finance disclosure.

Both the Romney and Paul forces did a good job of getting their supporters elected as delegates to the county conventions, the next stage in the process. At one north Vancouver precinct, for example, Romney was supported by 21 of the 45 voters who participated. Romney supporters then won four of the five delegate slots to the county convention while the other position went to a Paul supporter.
Hess said based on Lane's cell phone activity he expected two sectors of a specific cell phone tower to be used. But a call was picked up on the third sector, Hess said, which indicates Lane may have been in a different area.

If you factor out the pain and anguish Rachel Barton Pine has endured since 1995, she's leading essentially the life she envisioned as a child thunderstruck one indelible Sunday afternoon by the power of music.

When Adams was a city commissioner, back around the time City Hall began loosening zoning at the airport to allow big boxes, he hung an anti-Walmart sign in his office window and warned neighbors whenever the retailer began checking out Portland sites. When Walmart bosses considered the old Thunderbird Hotel on Hayden Island, he pushed a development moratorium that drove them off.
Can 28,000 people be wrong? Yes, in some cases. But not when it comes to the region's most popular participant sporting event, if you insist on calling it that. Some people do actually run (and race) the annual event that benefits the Sacramento Food Bank & Family Services. But most flock to east Sac to help the less fortunate, get in a nice preprandial stroll before another gluttonous turkey dinner and add another T-shirt to their collection. You cannot call yourself a true Sacramentan without participating in the Run To Feed the Hungry at least once. And once you do, you're liable to come back for seconds.

After the break-ins, Zimmerman's calls to 911 seemed to shift, zeroing in on black males. Were black males actually responsible for any of the crimes reported in the Retreat? Impossible to say. Morgenstern, the police spokesman, said last week that he was too overwhelmed with media requests to get the arrest records on individual cases.
Yet I suspect that virtually everyone in our industry — players, coaches, administrators, boosters, agents and fans — shed our naivete long ago. We know that the sole focus for many star college players is getting ready for pro ball, that coaches are looking for financial security on the backs of teen-agers and that boosters enjoy the ego stroke that comes with virtually owning a piece of a team. There’s nothing inherently wrong with these goals, but there’s nothing “amateur” about the process, either.
