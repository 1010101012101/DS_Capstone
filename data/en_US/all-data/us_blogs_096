Ah well, isn’t that the best seasoning to appreciate what you’ve done?

Be sure to email me your goals for this week. You only have three weeks (or less for some of you) of class left. Graphic design students need to complete the mock business assignments and post them on a display board. All students need to write a letter to me. Details of what should be included in the letter are in a previous post. This letter should be in a personal business letter format… not just paragraphs on a page. Some of you have submitted your letter and did a fantastic job with great feedback about the class.

Just over a week and half ago my son calls me up and asks, "You like Bobby Curtola, right?" to which I reply yes. He then asks me, "You met him once didn't you?" to which I again reply yes back in 2004 when he came to meet with our Executive Director for a meeting...hey I spoke to him on the telephone a few times too. The first time he called our office, he actually sang Corinna, Corinna to me just because my name was Corinne. Yes I am much younger than he thought I was when we met. Bobby was a hit back in the 1960's and I was born in the mid 60's. I always said I grew up in the wrong era....the music from the 50's and 60's were always my favorites growing up.

I consider myself incredibly fortunate to be who and what I am. I'm fortunate to be living at a time when somehow stars aligned and allowed an opportunity for an otherwise resigned soul who dared to imagine what it could be like on the other side of fear. And I think it's always important to remember where you come from because those are my roots. They just are. Whether I choose to accept that they're still a part of me or to otherwise justify that it was simply a phase that I've outgrown doesn't change how important I feel it is to go back and visit my past to truly appreciate my present and to re-energize me for the possibilities in my future.

Hey there! It’s morning!
Yesterday, I had quite the discouraging run. Since I ran 20 min straight twice last week, I thought it was silly to follow what c25k told me to do this week. Run 5 walk 3, Run 8 walk 3, then Run 5. So I was planning on shooting for 22min. Well my legs were so incredibly heavy, that I don’t think I made it more than 10 min of running before stopping to walk. I went for a total of 40 min with walking breaks. I tried to keep them minimal, 30-60sec at a time, but they were still there. Maybe the c25k program knows what it’s talking about, huh? It knew that I would be needing a break. So tomorrow, I will definitely stick to the program. Run 10, walk 3, Run 10. Hopefully I feel good and all goes well.

Then finally the main event Hip-hop party.
I also made crab apple, chili and rosemary jelly. Crab apples are too tart to eat but are great in a sweet or savory jelly. I only picked about 20 apples which I removed the stems and seeds of. Bring to boil with just about enough water to cover the wedges. Leave the skin on as it will be strained after anyway and the colour is so beautiful. Cook until soft and strain through a cheese cloth. The juice was enough for one jar of jelly. Even Martha Stewart likes crab apple jelly and she famously whipped up one during her time in jail with crab apples picked from trees on the prison camp grounds. Well, you just can take Martha out of the kitchen...

What is known about what happens when the environment is loaded with sulphur dioxide is bad enough, since the compound is the main component of acid rain, which according to the EPA “Causes acidification of lakes and streams and contributes to the damage of trees at high elevations (for example, red spruce trees above 2,000 feet) and many sensitive forest soils. In addition, acid rain accelerates the decay of building materials and paints, including irreplaceable buildings, statues, and sculptures that are part of our nation’s cultural heritage.”

When Dad moved to Texas and my mom, sister and eventually my brother once he was born, moved in with my mom's folks, I stayed with Grandma and Grandpa from January through June of my 8th grade year so I could finish the school year. It was the 2nd happiest time of my childhood. I had so much fun with my friends but the true reason for my happiness was that I was surrounded and immersed in unconditional love every day, all day long. That was the real gift of my grandparents. They gave me unending, unconditional love without reservations. No matter how much of a smartmouth I was, no matter how much of a brat, no matter how much I failed to appreciate them properly, they never once stopped loving me or being proud of me. Hell, my grandfather never so much as raised his voice to me in my life and even when I was a teenager, 6ft tall and towering over my grandmother, she always had a lap for me to lay my head in and cry if I needed it. They never once gave up on me. Not once.

DW: Probably pretty close to everyone else. I have a personal trainer I go to Monday through Friday, and usually we go an hour in the gym and work with weights and on the core and legs.

I also like to get in my backyard and shoot pucks when I get the opportunity and in a couple weeks I will start skating twice a week and that’s about it.

During his papacy (1566-1572), Pius V was faced with the almost overwhelming responsibility of getting a shattered and scattered Church back on its feet. The family of God had been shaken by corruption, by the Reformation, by the constant threat of Turkish invasion and by the bloody bickering of the young nation-states. In 1545 a previous pope convened the Council of Trent in an attempt to deal with all these pressing problems. Off and on over 18 years, the Church Fathers discussed, condemned, affirmed and decided upon a course of action. The Council closed in 1563.

It doesn't matter that this person was in the bar a few hours earlier and, unsure of what to go and watch, had asked the bartender his opinion was of a film. This bartender, making friendly banter, had said the film in question wasn't as good as the book, but that it was still quite good. Apparently this bartender had been horrifically misinformed and, although this other person hadn't actually read the original book, he'd decided to come back into the peaceful bar to threateningly tell the bartender what an idiot he was. It wasn't 'quite' good, he said through gritted teeth with finger pointed, it was 'very' good, and he should get his facts straight.

Every once in a while, I like family epics. Usually, I don’t have much of a taste for contemporary domesticity in fiction—which is hilarious, considering how much of a homebody I can be—but something about it spread over generations or, if done properly, a single generation, engages me. I’m also fond of self-made families, whether they’re chosen or not; I’m reminded of a bit in the documentary Waking Sleeping Beauty when Don Hahn talks about how the animators at Disney, during a particularly grueling production period, essentially composed a family all their own. I find their dynamic interesting because the bond is deeper, yet more ephemeral than blood bonds. This, rather than an interest in the history of rock-and-roll, is what prompted me to pick up Evening’s Empire.

Thought 2. Preparing the food is probably more fun than eating it. By the time the turkey is ready to go in the oven, I'm so grossed out by the thought of eating it that the cooking of the turkey is almost like an afterthought (I'm really all about the stuffing, actually. The turkey is the vessel). Something you have to go through with since you've come this far already.
It’s not bad, it’s just underwhelming. The animation is beautiful but director Jennifer Yuh Nelson never seems to utilize it, ignoring the potential for elegant kung fu action sequences in favor of close-up gags involving Po’s incompetence or his big belly. Kung Fu Panda 2 has a voice cast or enormous talent, including Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman and Gary Oldman, all of who are fine but ultimately contribute very little. Voices from Seth Rogen, David Cross and even Jack Black himself are really grating in this movie, because even though they are all talented people the anachronism of their voices in an Ancient Chinese setting are irritating to no end. It certainly couldn’t have been cheap to cast Jackie Chan and Jean-Claude Van Damme in roles here and, considering they don’t have a single complete line between them, it was not money well spent. Ancient China is a great setting for a children’s film and it is a shame that it is wasted on this franchise which centers around such an unlikeable main character. Po is not bad but he’s obnoxious to a fault and it spoils what could be a great concept. To the film’s credit I will say that I have a certain affection for the relationship between Po and Mr. Ping, which consistently provides the truly funny and tender moments that are lacking in the rest of the film.

A final piece of evidence that suggests the spontaneous origins of this coup is the name the ruling junta chose for itself: La Comité National pour le Redressement de la Démocratie et la Restauration de l’Etat (National Committee for Recovering Democracy and Restoring the State). Regardless of whether it signals the true motivations of the putschists, this has to be the worst name for any governing body in living memory — awkward to say and uninspiring to hear. ORTM journalists and even Captain Sanogo himself continually struggle on air to get its exact wording straight, and have frequently misstated its abbreviation. Early abbreviations tended toward “CNRDR,” as though the final état were absent, but in the last few days “CNRDRE” has been used more commonly (though still not exclusively) in state media. If you were going to plan out a coup, wouldn’t you at least come up with a name for your junta that you could remember?

July 20 – Camden, NJ @ Susquehanna Bank Center
Like many confronted with serious illness or chronic disability I have asked myself, self-pityingly at times, "Why me?" I get anxious, frustrated, angry, frightened, panicky - a gamut of emotions surrounding my breathlessness. But while my emotional state with all its attendant irrationalities may play a big part in my management of the disease, it has no bearing on the origins of the disease itself. So I am not looking to the psychosomatic or to karma or to some mystical mumbo-jumbo for explanation as to "Why me?". Rather my search for a rational explanation is one that makes sense within the framework of evidence recognisable as appropriate to science and scientific studies.

This last is clearly what gave rise to objections to the book on its first publication, objections which our group couldn't help sharing, Jo especially. We were unanimously alienated by the casual cruel snobberies and selfish and high-handed behaviour of the characters, which often went seemingly unremarked by the narrative: the constant reference to 'types', both 'higher' and 'lower', that the characters would or would not want to associate with, the fact that servants are worthy of notice only when they are 'shiftless' or found drinking the wine, the casual witty dinner conversation about what would be inside a waiter if you dissected him ('Old menus ... pieces of broken china and tips and pencils stubs'), the easy and taken-for-granted way that on two occasions Dick pays off the police to protect reputations. And as for Nicole: as John pointed out, it seems that her 'madness' consists merely of being upset when she realises that her husband is involved with another woman and in being the only person to get upset when a man, who happens to be black, is found dead on Rosemary's hotel bed! (Dick, as someone in the group pointed out, seems to find Nicole's reaction to this last far more remarkable and a far greater matter for concern than the discovery of the body, which he characterises as 'only some nigger scrap'.) After Nicole receives a letter informing her that Dick has seduced a fifteen-year-old patient and confronts Dick with it, his behaviour seems astonishingly reprehensible. The narrative informs us, without any irony that we could pick up, that Dick was not at all to blame, the girl had tried to seduce him, and all he had done was kiss her! In front of their children, Dick orders Nicole to pull herself together and initiates an immediate family outing. Nicole's distraught behaviour during the outing, which from our perspective seemed natural reaction, is then proof to Dick that she must be institutionalised once more in a psychiatric hospital. In this episode the narrative seems to share Dick's view of himself as hard-done-to and of Nicole as his unfair burden. Nicole's final recovery at the end of the novel involves her rejection of Dick (marriage to whom had originally been seen as her cure) and this is seen, quite straightforwardly it seemed to us, as his tragedy.

I failed miserably at my attempt to clean out my pantry. I had made a 'resolution' to use up what was in my pantry and freezer, only buying fresh ingredients and those staples that I needed on a regular basis-flour, sugar, tuna. I failed. I have this odd neurosis-I am afraid we are going to starve. I really don't know if this is somehow attributed to the stories of my youth about how there wasn't enough food to go around when I was really young. How my Mom would sit out on the porch with a cup of coffee, while my Dad and sister ate, and I picked through the few things I liked.

Now, it was springtime during my stay, a cool, cool springtime with a hint of winter still in the air, but springtime nonetheless. There was no snow on the ground. Biking and walking were easy.

Limited effective treatment with a canine distemper vaccination has allowed this deadly disease of dogs to spread widely in most countries and was responsible for the near extinction of the black-footed ferret.
The mistake Kelly made was relying on the biography by Rene Kraus to round out his research, which later biographers have found to be riddled with errors. Kraus never states a birth date in Young Lady Randolph (1943), but he repeatedly insinuates she was born in 1850, such as referring to her as a “10 year old beauty” at an event that took place in 1860.

I thought about waiting a few weeks, thinking this would be the BEST April Fool’s joke ever, but decided against it.
I am so grateful for all that is here in this universe, for all that I am creating and for the people I have brought into my life. Thank you!
Performance anxiety. Perfectionism. I have to remind myself of my own advice; perfectionism is nothing more than low self-esteem. I still draw. I still write (obviously). I still do my work.
I read all the time and enjoy a variety of topics. I tend to move from one style and type of book to another. I blend mystery novels, historical biographies, cultural resources, and sports stories. On any given day I am probably reading a couple of books as well as tracking an audio book in my Jeep or on my iPad.
In college, I had an idealistic, socialist professor who had a significant early influence on my architectural preferences. He also colored my interest in art to some degree. He introduced me to Constantin Brancusi, a Romanian sculptor who rose to prominence during the first half of

The glass shoes became Christmas presents for the client and the client’s sisters and launched a series. Then a man asked Friedrich to make a Cinderella’s glass slipper to hold a ring for his hoped-for fiancee. Friedrich liked the sloped structure and enjoyed pushing the glass to its limits.
There are so many things that I love about this quilt - so I'm just going to run through a couple of them.
Welcome sports fans, homosexuals, mom bloggers, and likely just empty air! Before I explode your brains with some sports knowledge, let’s talk about ME! Here is a little bit of background for those of you who don’t think I know anything about sports:

I have been away from the blogging for a few days. Over the weekend I was playing the Diablo 3 beta, which I cannot wait to release hah, so needless to say, I have been terribly side tracked.
A movement/entity it is never attacked from without before it destroys itself from within. The national interests are not at stakes from spies but rather at the political bureaucrats who are supposed to serve the needy population but instead are doing worse than nothing.
3. Talk to yourself. This is annoying to those around you and confirms the thought that you are either a crazy person or a lonely person who is used to having nobody around to talk to but yourself. Instead of thinking out loud, just think to yourself, until you’re alone for real.

I LOVE love love the ornaments on this tree – they’re mostly silver and white and glass. Lots of shimmer! They are just gorgeous:
Caitin at All About Growing Up and Becoming a Famous Author tagged me in this meme, which I've been following around bloggerland and really enjoying. I love the title of Caitin's blog - it reminds me of all the dreams I had as a child.
I did leave eventually and came back on Tuesday prepared to pretend it had never happened.
But there's a bit of humour to be found in everything if you look closely enough:
Hello MIM fans!
“I hear it’s very nice down there.”
“This year, we may see our African and Filipino missions partners reach a ‘tipping point’ in their embrace of church-planting movements,” says Dwight McGuire, Pioneers’ lead missiologist. “In post-training evaluations, participants are saying ‘I wish we would have had this type of training five, 10, even 15 years ago.’ And these people are telling other believers that they need to think about CPMs.”
She’s got no info for him so he bids her farewell but no kdrama heroine is going to accept a man’s kindness without trying to repay it… well, mainly because we need the leads to reunite… so she follows him and that leads to more hijinks and even before the lie in the title begins, people have already begun to assume they are a couple. And how odd is it that this is one of the most realistic things about this drama? Because there have definitely been a time or ten when I’m with a friend, a stranger or even my BROTHER when random strangers have assumed we are together. Why, people? A man and a woman can be together without being a couple! But I digress.
Often I have wished I could have been with the walking Jesus; today I'm reminded of the sorrow that also entailed.
“No,” she was told by my friend, “he was the chief prosecution witness.”
I talked briefly with Stephen last night. He sounded good but is still in ICU. He has had 2 stints and hopes that any other issues can be corrected without surgery. He indicated that maybe they would let him go home in a few days. I passed along all the well-wishes from all of you and he said thank you very much, it meant a lot to him.

I'd like to clarify some things after reading a couple of yesterday's comments. I am sure my long term readers already know this and I feel it so deeply I don't spell it out in every post like this. I'm accepting of all types of relationships. In fact I wrote about this last week here. I don't expect to see only husbands and wives, or men working with women at home. I don't think every couple should have children. I think people should live to their own values (not mine) and do what makes them happy. I believe that is why I get so many emails about the stages of life - I don't judge and I don't expect anyone to live as I do. To me, a partnership is formed when two people commit to each other - those two people could be a man and a women, or the same sex, and they can be married or not. I have gay friends my age I have know most of my life, and they're all in relationships. I wrote yesterday's post directed at the woman who emailed me. It was her experience and mine I was referring to, it didn't reflect any specific view on what makes a family.
Sam Raimi’s original Spider-Man sort of defined what a Marvel film should be. Instead of trying to reinvent the superhero for the screen, Raimi reinvented the screen for the superhero. What ended up on screen was literally a “comic book movie”. A movie the reveled in the way that comics told stories with the visual grandeur of a motion picture. Raimi not only helped to get our favorite web slinger off the ground but also numerous other mask men who, until then, were never given a chance.
Actually, I don't even know if they are all hens or not. One or more could be a rooster. I really hope not since I think that the city ordinance here prevents anyone from keeping a rooster, due to their loud alarm clock style nature. ;)
Luring a substantial contingent of bestselling authors away from the Big Six seems the only plausible route for an imprint to affect Amazon’s overall business. Amazon needed someone with a substantial industry pedigree to pull this off. Amazon quickly – in time for last spring’s Book Expo America -- landed just the man for the job: Larry Kirshbaum, formerly of Warner Books.
I also enjoy this movie because it touches on something that is close to my heart as a teacher-bullying. It breaks my heart to think about the way children/teenagers treat certain people. It breaks my heart even more to hear of how this can lead some young people to feel like their only option is to take their own life. Why do we put a value on people? Why are some people worth more than others to us? What makes us think we’re better than anyone else? This is a huge problem that only seems to be getting worse. This scares me.
Anyhoo, I have lots of thoughts about this novela but I’ll stop there. Suffice it to say, this novela is a cornerstone of my evenings 6 days a week.
Serious coriander and orange peel. Nose and flavor. Goes down smooth. Less filling and great taste. As I type this two days later, I want to get a keg of this stuff and hook it up to my veins. High 4 stars for the Fish.

There is more space back to the left, but it’s full too. So here’s the progression of work…..Ms. R. searches out the furniture and coordinates picking it up. I (try) to help base coat. I organize, sort and otherwise try to find space for furniture hardware, paint, etc. when I’m not doing that. Heather…..well she’s the true artist. She does all of the pattern.
“Peace,” Fortunatus said and removed his hands from Ronan.
So as we cave in to this man, please see below this man of hatred that so many choose to support. This is the man - who calls out wanting to know who will next step up to murder Israelis, who will carry the explosives and fire the guns against my people?

The physical reality of not having my son to see, talk to and be with is the worst pain of all. Sometimes in the car, I draw from memory to have conversations with him. I try not to think too much about the fact that he would be working on is dissertation supported by a dissertation fellowship. He would have had some ability to plan some free days, perhaps to visit here longer or to travel. I don’t think about the woman he started dating, because my heart can’t take it. I think about his other friends now and then, but often block information on Facebook. I can’t really put a name to the feelings the information brings, so I avoid it.
(3) Chill the dough for about one hour – you can just leave it how it is in the bowl. This is a very important step, trust me!!
I’ve never really believed in nothing. I mean, the concept of nothing is not something I ever believed in. That sort of came out sounding like a statement made by a double-negative using, nihilistic Forrest Gump.
Throughout this week, the vast majority of the anime series I’ve followed this season will be finishing. As such, I’ll offer my opinions on them as a whole.
One thing Americans like to do is eat, and the Peach Festival had a wide variety of different foods for just about every conceivable taste. The Sweet Spot (above) had things for those with a sweet tooth.
The bird mirror was $4, and goes very well with our bed and dresser. The "Big Oak Tree" picture was $5, and I had to have it since one of my favorite things about the south are the beautiful, gigantic Live Oaks.
“Would it kill you, to show a bit of encouragement?” I called her up last night, after I had decided that I simply could not deal with it, any more. It was some time near 9pm. she was in the house, just a football field away. And, I am pretty sure she was getting ready to go to sleep. “Did it even cross your mind, to show a little support.”
There are two anthologies I’m doing.
Variations I have made:
The dumb asses get to the cabin and it turns out to Bunnyman’s place and now we’ve got a rip-off of every backwoods torture slasher film going but we don’t see the deaths on-screen they are just implied with blood. There’s a terrible rape scene with Bunnyman’s pet hunchback dry humping one of the women but it’s as unconvincing as the death scenes.
Since Bryan and Jeremy were climbin the Petzl Ridge of the Grand Teton, I tagged along with Matt and Holly but sadly, did not eat any chicken because the line was cray-cray long. Instead, I partook in the baked goods section and procured myself a peanut butter and jelly bar with a Diet Coke. Sassy.

Dr. White said there was much more to be said but did not want to give away the story and insisted the trilogy be read -- he did not want to give away the plot.
...And then maybe I can marry a rich, rich man who will buy genetically engineered miniature Serengeti animals for our children's back yard menagerie. Or maybe I can just marry Alexander Skarsgard. The Clan of the Cave Bear taught me that you become pregnant when your spirit animal is overcome by another, and seeing as how Alexander chooses to amble rather nakedly into my dreams on a regular basis, this may very well be a Skarsgard in the oven. That, my friends, is called "happily ever after".

"Au contraire mon ami. I'm actually uncharacteristically rooting for romance this time," he said wistfully.
Being of Italian decent, I took particular interest in the legend of Befana, who every year apparently flies across the sky on January 6th (during the Feast of the Three Kings) searching for the Christ child. It is said that Old Befana visits all the children of Italy leaving them candies, cookies and gifts in hopes that one might be the Baby King of Bethlehem. Tomie de Paola’s retelling of this old tale is unique because of the detail in his illustrations. The story is carried out with pages are of biblical imagery. For example, throughout the book there are many pictures of a six-pointed star which represents the star of creation. Also shown with the three kings is a panther which is a symbol of the way all ‘true believers’ are drawn to Christ and an oak tree which is the symbol of strength. For all the teachers out there, this book could be read to your class with a follow up cooking lesson for Pizelle cookies!4. Hershel and the Hanukkah Goblins
Remember it used to look like this:
This is a ‘documentary’ and yet there is absolutely no way to check any of these facts against reality. According to Mr. Maddin, Winnipeg has a civic law prohibiting the destruction of signage, thus the creation of the world’s largest graveyard of discarded signs. Fake Nazis invaded the city during WWII as a test to see what would actually happen if the fuhrer made it across the pond. The town has an epidemic of sleepwalkers. What do you make of this? Do you sit there, declaring what’s bullshit and what’s not? Do you call the man on his shenanigans? Or do you sit back and allow the insanity to take hold, to seep through your every pore and infect you with the oddity of pure sense. Not an ounce of this picture is coherent and yet you never question. Once the claws are in, you let it drag you along, smacking your head against the sidewalks of ‘irrationality’ and ‘Oedipal complexes’. It’s as though you’re sitting next to a good friend, showing you his/her art film. Every time you ask a question, such as ‘Did you have to dissect a pig anus? And did you have to do it to a soundtrack of the Backstreet Boys?’ they yell ‘SHUT THE FUCK UP AND WATCH’. And you do. You do shut the fuck up. And you do watch.

Especially when you can get a bar of soap from the local Dollar Tree right ?
Starting on the left we have of course THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. Sound by William Bell & Director Tobe Hooper. Another no brainer that shouldn't need explaining. Dutch Oven was cool enough to take the entire movie and dub it straight on to a 90 minute cassette! That's right, the ENTIRE MOVIE, word for word. Even the creepy John Laroquette intro. The only thing more fucked up than watching the movie is LISTENING TO IT.
My mother’s words:” In fact it isn’t even him, but it is his ego, your ego…what you perceive. Accept everything and let it pass through you. Put out positive energy and compassion to this man. There is no him to remember…it’s just part of the illusion.”

Those who know me will often see little 'treasures' on my creations. These may be bits of jewellery, small pieces picked up from ebay, car-boot sales or charity shop finds, and I have a couple of small boxes filled with old watch pieces, game pieces, vintage sewing things, vintage ephemera, keys, frozen charlotte dolls, bottle tops as well as new things like the TH Idea-ology range.
The vision, right. Rissad Van Raighan, and a huge door that a Gift-Giver wanted to keep him from. Well, if Chag Van Raighan was a master thief, what must his elder brother be like? Rel explained as quickly as he could. If it was possible, Pollack’s face seemed to get darker with every word.
it loathes.Proteus is, at this point, trying to win Silvia for himself, though Thurio doesn't know it (in fact, the latter thinks Proteus is helping him, Thurio, press his own suit). And it seems to me that there is an obvious dick-size double entendre going on in the talk about the size of Thurio's "leg" — Proteus, the undisclosed rival, implying Thurio's dick is too tiny — but Barton, in her footnote glosses, ignores it, telling us instead that "spurr'd" means "incited" and is an "obvious quibble on Thurio's reference to being booted" (which itself, in this context, could have a bawdy meaning, too; but Barton ignores that as well).
and then other people saying things like “Oh,
Age of Autism’s argument is to compare the risk to the infinitely smaller risks of chemotherapy and radiation in cancer cases, proving once again that vaccines don’t poison children; anti-vaccinationists do (when they get their way). Orac discusses this further here. Seriously, Age of Autism might as well at this point be promoting cyanide as a cure for autism . . . or leeches.
That leaves 141 toss-up votes in 11 states — Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. If you live in one of those states, you’ll be having a presidential campaign. The rest of us will just watch.
There were mountains surrounding us the entire time we were there.
OK, so it’s not a huge loss for them. But it does affect their depth at running back a bit. And, who knows, maybe… Alright, I’m just kind of rambling on because I’m trying to ignore this thought in the back of my head that is showing a little persistence. Maybe if I were to look at it from another angle… Thank the Gods this wasn’t us. Yeah, that’s a much more palatable way of looking at it. Because “What if it had been us?”, frankly, scares the hell out of me.
The flowers look blue, but they are actually a lovely deep purple shade.
There's the 'bucket list' that is popular these days; places you have to go to before you turn to dust.
The total exhaustion I felt last week is waning. Now I am “just tired”. By this time next month I will be giddy with renewed energy because it will be the last days of the school year. Sunshine, yard work, and a couple of days at the beach will be like heaven.
In Dubai, Kelly Maelzel, in-demand Australian zoologist, is blackmailed into accepting a new job – protecting the visitors to a strange new project. A millionaire philanthropist has created a game reserve where the livestock are particularly violent, unpredictable… and human.
So I gave it a try. It comes in Strawberry (which I couldn’t try because I’m allergic to strawberries but Mike loved it), Chocolate, which was fantastic and Vanilla which was so-so. I got to try two of each and I have to admit putting them in water made them taste okay, passable and good for you but I tried them in skim milk and they tasted amazing, yes it added calories but I figured it into my daily calorie and food allowance so I was good.

Marley muttered the word, family. He looked at Roland. Studied him. He sensed some sort of deception in play but thought that maybe his suspicions were being fueled by his dislike of the person in question.
On the other hand..my mum is 91 and not having the best of times. Life is boring and painful, and she misses my dad, who died a decade ago. She’s still got plenty of marbles but not her sight or hearing and she can’t go for a walk because of arthritis (and recently it’s got even worse than that – but I won’t go into that now).
One of those kind of days ya just feel like going back to bed and covering up your head!
And guess what? A bunch of us, including me, have prizes to give away - so don't miss any stops on the hop!

After years of hearing liberals tell us that any criticism of President Obama is because he is Black, it seems to me they ought to admit that he got elected because he is Black. In the interest of accuracy, he is half-Black and half-White. I say this because the media has now begun calling the shooter of Trayvon Martin a “White-Hispanic.”
Rolling around in end zones.
Today we headed off to the Tower of London. We had saved up our Grandparents babysitting options in order to not take the kids to the tower with us. Its a long day there and in all honestly its just not interesting to 2 small children. While they have done their best to be wheelchair accessible (aka pram friendly) its an ancient castle with cobbled roads and lots of stairs and narrow halls. Sadly, Grandma called around 7am (waking us up) to tell us that Grandad wasn't feeling well so they wouldn't be able to have the kids. I will admit I did entertain the thought of telling Adam to go to the tower alone with his sister as the kids were just going to ruin the day for us anyway, but I wanted to see the Crown Jewels too.

With this in mind, I am wondering why there is a resistance (no pun intended) to strength training amongst the fairer sex. I am ready to explore this area as much as I can from home. With limited time and resources the gym is not an ideal option for me. There are many benefits to including weights in our exercise programmes. For me, the most exciting reason is that muscle cells eat more calories than fat cells!! They are hungrier 24 hours a day. : ) They also look sleeker and more toned, but they are heavier. Who cares?? That is another reason why I don’t agree with weighing ourselves. There is a reduced risk of osteoporosis, diabetes and heart disease and general injury.
I wrote one post on this already, then deleted it. It was just me irritated and venting the irritation. Why so irritated? This site is where it all started for me. It is actually an interesting read, I made it several pages deep myself. But what stood out was how so many people managed to take so much out in loans and now think that they are somehow exempt from paying it back. One guy has about 150,000 in loans for an art degree. I look at art on my local coffee shop and see that the artists are asking for their paintings and usually think, “Good luck with that.” I doubt I would say to myself, I want an art degree and I think I am so good that I will be able to make enough to pay back 150,000 in debt, yet, I am that good.
how cute am I
The Backyard Makeover exhibit is a permanent part of the zoo, with volunteers available everyday 10am-4pm. Weekdays, the booth is usually staffed by Oregon Zoo volunteers, weekends by Master Gardeners, and for the next two months, Master Recyclers will be out there as well on the first Fridays. I will be back on September 2nd. I’ll do another “take a picture with the Trashmaster, win a prize” event as well. Come on out, say hello and pet a worm with me!
With my ongoing chronological journey through the work of H.P. Lovecraft--all performed on my Kindle--this idea struck me as particularly cool. The perfect blending of the ancient and the modern...sorcery and science. Imagine flipping open the Necronomicon and reading about the Necronomicon. Or a digital Harlequin Romance. Whatever floats your boat.
Last time I talked about skincare / haircare, I was testing Liz Earle. I used her products for five months, hoping to get that clean, inner glow but alas... no results. They weren't bad at all but I didn't see any improvement and I was getting bored... so I've moved on.
Student politics still follows the Boyo rules of instant irrelevance, in so far as the gowned masses can be roused from their rent-book torpor at all. Spengler and Gramsci would have picked up the gamey reek of decadence and nihilism in their chosen causes - The war in Iraq was "Not in My Meme", and the "We Are All Hezbollahas" are indifferent to the bigots Medieval and modern who litter their rallies like trousers in a Whitehall farce.
Here is a list of all of them:
Try to pick a table with opposite knowledgeable players. Playacting a spirited equal salamander or bludgeon at a tableland replete of amateurs present put you at a discriminate, but at the synoptical moment you do not requirement to cull a plateau where you are the bottom participant no thing how swell you are.
They fight for their country, their homes, their families, their own rights and their very existence as a nation and a people. They also fight for freedom - and that includes giving the Shministim and their ilk the right to their own opinions. Many are maimed or pay the ultimate price for these things - they give their lives.
Now I'm off to find an Arby's. Wish me luck. I think I'm going to need it.
Now, I mentioned the whole "trance" thing. And that mysterious Colorman character. This strange little man keeps showing up the artists and offering them paint, especially ultramarine, the Sacre Bleu. This is the color used to paint the Virgin Mary and is extremely rare. The Colorman never accepts money from the artists, who indeed are never really sure they want to buy color from him, although they always seem to end up with some. The artists seem to lose time while painting with it. There are paintings they remember working on but don't seem to be anywhere. And of course there's the matter of Van Gogh's letters to his brother Theo about a Colorman following him to Arles.
There’s been a lot of interest in Bucket Lists ever since the inspiring movie with Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson came out. It’s a wonderful idea – making a list of things you want to do before you “kick the bucket”. In the movie, Morgan Freeman waits until he has a terminal illness to make his list which raises the question in my mind, “Why wait?”
That's what I thought of too when they told us our daughter along with all the other babies would be arriving right outside our hotel rooms at 7:30. "There's the man with the beard" I told my wife when I first heard the screams after the elevator doors opened- but I don't think she heard me.
As you’ve probably read, I’m having an amazing time here in the land of the light. I’ve posted a few updates about what we’ve been doing to share with our readers, but I haven’t spoken too much about what I’m having issues with. I feel like it’s important to discuss these things. On one hand, maybe I’m trying to be TOO perfect and am mad at myself for kind of failing. On the other hand, maybe I could be doing better?
Most importantly, the report shows the "green" building standards do not pay for themselves in any reasonable time frame. Examining two "green" schools, JLARC notes the payback time ranged from 27 to 30 years. Even this is generous for two reasons.

Another proposal would have removed attempted crimes from the list of violent crimes requiring longer sentences. D.A.’s could reinstate the designation for individual cases. Once again, a free solution lowering the inmate population one case at a time.
First, the cast includes a number of real-life participants playing themselves. Ben Sliney, the FAA's National Operations Manager, plays himself as do other FAA officials. Several civilian air traffic controllers in the Newark control tower also play themselves and the pilots and stewardesses aboard Flight 93 are played by real life airline pilots and flight attendants. In the scenes at the Northeast Air Defense Command Center, most of the military personnel are played by real-life military air traffic controllers, including Major James Fox who was in the command center on September 11th.
That’s why I’m asking Seventeen Magazine to commit to printing one unaltered — real — photo spread per month. I want to see regular girls that look like me in a magazine that’s supposed to be for me.
We are getting ready for our party. Mr Young vacuums Archie and the sofa. We have our usual argument about where to put the kitchen table. I want to leave it where it is, but Mr Young thinks we should put it in the bay window. I tell him that’s a ridiculous idea.

There was something else that caught our attention. The sound output of the Nokia 808 PureView was superb. Undoubtedly, one of the best in the industry. The Agneepath trailer, captured in Dobly Digital Plus, sounded superb over the headphones as well as the speaker. The handset is also Dobly Headphone compatible, a special software designed for the Nokia device that can decode the content recorded in Dobly Digital and play it in multichannel. There is also a Dolby on/off mode, usually seen in laptops. While turning off the Dolby icon, there was a noticeable downscale in the sound. Nokia claims this Dolby headphone option works well with any stereo headphone be it the one bundled in the pack or a Bose unit or even over a home theatre system. The output over the speaker was also praiseworthy but not similar to on the headphone. While playing with the settings, we could not locate the equaliser settings, but we doubt we will ever need one.

I inked the solid cake stamp with 4 colors of Dew Drop Memento Inks (the dew drop shape makes it easy to ink small sections) and stamped it on the muslin bag. I stamped the swag along the top and adhered colorful sequins to it. Then I stamped the sentiment along the bottom.
My parents, much to my ambivalence, did not grow squash this year. I was not so much disappointed that I wouldn't be pulling a muscle or two reaching for a 4-inch marrow before it grew to a foot, but that the pilgrimages through the marketplace for the blossoms made me just as sore and stressed. I'd grabbed up a serendipitously found box of them several weeks ago, and decided, like most first timers, to prepare a fritto misto, rather than stuff and fuss and possibly ruin them.

This week I came across quite a few articles that I found interesting.
It's like happiness. The route to happiness is usually indirect. You don't achieve happiness by trying to be happy. You achieve happiness by doing something else -- spending time with people you like or learning to do something well. But trying to be happy will mostly make you miserable.
Since I am not a fan of reality or game shows, I'm coming up with my own. I think I would win big on what I am calling, "Show Me Your House" because I take a lot of pride in my house. It is always clean and tidy and I get a lot of compliments on the way it is decorated. It is something I simply enjoy doing, but if I could win doing it--I'd take it--sure.
But every journey begins with the first step, and there are some simple steps that all Lib Dems can take now to increase our involvement and visibility in the modern co-operative movement:

After the viewing today we decided to hop over to the wine bar to get some grub so I wouldnt have to cook dinner. To our surprise, our friend Jonny let his family know we were there since they were in town, so they came and joined us! Jonny, Jen, Tia, Rose, Carin and Mom, we love you and are so grateful for you! Jonny, thank you for that wonderful surprise! We had such a nice time chatting. Made my night and made me feel at home.
Given the choice, I think I would take the gemstone link bracelet which features tourmalines, aquamarines, peridots, amethysts, topazes and garnets. It's not like anyone is offering me the choice. I'm just throwing it out there.
I also have to admit to eating way too much of the things that are bad for your teeth. I am badly addicted to sugar, especially chocolate. That might be considered to be a separate issue to the mental illness, but I'm aware that I use chocolate to self-medicate. That's actually a little more rational than it sounds. Modern studies are showing there are definitely natural anti-depressant chemicals present in cocoa. It's unfortunate that it usually comes processed and mixed up with lots of fat and sugar.
So what experiences have you had moving into a new apartment? Do you have any tips for me on what I should do while moving?

And there was a collective WHA?!!! followed by a YEAH!!! as Colton is revealed to be the bottom vote getter. With Jessica having already taken the judges’ save, nothing can protect him from elimination. Good riddance I say. His time on this show was painful to watch. Plus there was the whole thing of the judges and/or producers letting him in when he didn’t formally audition for the show. Like Dante Hicks at the Quick Stop, Colton wasn’t even supposed to be there this season. Now he is out. Might there be hope for this show? Probably not, but I can still count my blessings.

When I saw "The Bang Bang Club" last year, I worried about what it would do for reconciliation between people who still remember the violence and those who still miss loved ones who were taken from them. It's not that we shouldn't remember the past for fear that it is too painful. The subject of black-on-black violence is not taboo. But it does demand truth. There is no space for artistic liberties or creative rewrites of real events. If we are going to remember this past, we must do so with integrity, honesty and laudable motive.
The store charges its consignment authors according to a tiered fee structure: $25 simply to stock a book (five copies at a time, replenished as needed by the author for no additional fee); $75 to feature a book for at least two weeks in the “Recommended” section; and $125 to, in addition to everything else, mention the book in the store’s email newsletter, feature it on the Local Favorites page of the store’s website for at least 60 days, and enable people to buy it online for the time it’s stocked in the store.
Trust yourself! There is no great year than 2012 to learn to do that!
We can then reflect on the glory that was our Antipodean adventure on another 24 hour flight in leper’s undergarments. We will have another 18 thousand kilometers at our disposal to remember the laughs we had cleaning up vomit for the first 4 days, the piles of rubble from the 3 thereafter, and the road rage and loss of our deposit from the last 2 weeks.
We all love certain books a bit more than others. They might not be bestsellers, or they might be critically acclaimed, but we think of them as ours, like no one else knows they even exist.
Not so new is this recording by the great Patsy Cline. Several folks recorded this song, but this is the one that helped raise me and I prefer it. I pretty much prefer anything sung by Patsy. BTW: The photograph is one I took on the road to Valentine, Nebraska, as I as drove out west last year. I take its picture every chance I get. Talk about the potential for wind.... Anyway, without further ado, here's Patsy:
When the history books are written about Goldman Sachs, they may reflect that the current chief executive officer, Lloyd C. Blankfein, and the president, Gary D. Cohn, lost hold of the firm’s culture on their watch. I truly believe that this decline in the firm’s moral fiber represents the single most serious threat to its long-run survival.
The movie was great. I was captivated the whole length of the movie. The one thing that did bother me was the shaking. I believe it was done to limit the amount of violence that needed to be shown while still trying to get the intense feeling of violence across to the audience. It just made me dizzy.

If you’re an arachnophobe, I’d advise you to look away now. That’s because my latest ebook is full of spiders. In particular, there’s a rather unfriendly spider queen called Arachne who likes to lay her eggs in unseemly places. If you’re very unlucky, she’ll show you her spinnerets …

As the rest of my day unfolded I started to really relate to what a chick feels like as it is cracking thru the shell of an egg. All my external energy was pretty much non-existent, but internally there was a party going on. I could feel the inner energy zooming and zipping and doing god knows what… while the energy that fuels my ability to move even a muscle in life… it left the building! What a strange quandary within let me tell ya.
It also was a bit of a burden. I gained the reputation as one who would speak his mind no matter what others might say about it, including supervisors. (I have reached a point where using ‘his’ in that last sentence felt foreign.) I had a very interesting relationship with the last warden I worked for in the prison system. In fact, one of the interruptions to this post was an exchange of emails I had with her yesterday after she got the letter I sent through my friend the food service administrator.

On our recent drive home from one of the Danish islands, after visiting my husbands family, we experience beautiful views of a late sunset as it unraveled over the sea, before we embarked on a ferry to take us home. Later we watched the silver skies accompany us home all the way through to the other side of midnight.

I have a wonderful family, who I love! But I also have wonderful friends whom I love, and consider them family, and I can’t forget about my Mr. Curious who is so special to me. My friends are all beautiful and unique in their own way. I have to say that I look up to my friends and consider them a role model. When I see how beautiful and amazing their personalities are, I inspire to be like them! I don’t see all my friends to often, but we always are able to pick up where we leave off from the time before.
Then next morning I took a shower. Nothing strange in that. Basic hygiene. But the shower is my idea factory. I have a direct line to the idea reservoir plumbed into the house via copper pipe and the ideas come squirting out of the shower head each morning. (This is, I think, because the shower is the one place on earth where I cannot take my notebook.) So after jotting down the idea on my whiteboard while naked and dripping on the carpet (Sarah is used to this, it happens a lot. She's very patient) the CERN idea took hold, almost fully formed.

He told me that I'd left some boxes at my old house (his new girlfriend's house, remember) when I moved out, and that he'd brought them with him because he figured he'd see my brother. I told him, let's go get them because I wanted that to be the end of it... closure. We walked to his truck then to my car to put the stuff away, then he walked back over to where my brother and Steph were sitting. And that's when the best thing I've ever seen happened.

We have felt very alone in all of this. If you describe it to someone, if they see him react to a trigger and ask what is wrong, it's nearly impossible to say. It sounds like it's all in his head, like we are coddling him by letting him take his meals upstairs to eat when we have company over, like he is a brat and we are indulging him. I assure you, this is not the case. C is not being willful. He told me the other day that he would happily let doctors cut out parts of his brain if that would stop this. As stressful as it is for us, it is even more stressful for him. His life with Asperger Syndrome was already like walking through a minefield every day, and now it is 100 times worse, because he never knows when someone will come around the corner smacking their gum or munching on a breath mint and send him right into a full-fledged panic/rage attack. If you've ever had a panic attack yourself, then you know what he is feeling multiple times per day, every single day. It is debilitating.

So, we went to MCS, then took a ride up to our local fabric shop where we buy our ribbon.

The point that I hear resurface over and over again from the right wing activist side of this argument is that we live in an increasingly violent society. Children are exposed to a shocking level of violence through television, film and video games, and that it impacts physiological change on the brain, causing them to desensitize.

Jones’ story demonstrates how unrealistic it is to set standards of “proof” for people to identify their gender transition. If trans people were celebrated for their authenticity, they would not face the undue hardship of being punished just for being who they are.
Her lips barely fit around his cock, but even still, she had half of him stuffed in her mouth. Dim light came through the half-open window and made both of them glisten a little – her with a little trail of sweat on her belly and him from the saliva on his rod. I couldn’t help it. For the space of thirty, maybe forty-five seconds, I just stared, completely enraptured by the show in front of me. Both of them were completely oblivious to anything going on around them. That made it hotter, I think. The two of them were so devoted to pleasuring one another that they had no idea that someone was watching.

In the grand scheme of Canada’s commercial trade interests and imperialist intrigues in the Gulf, the fate of one of its citizens appears to be a matter that needs to be buried rather than raised.

“Therefore, we, in the International Union of Muslim Scholars, demanded, on more than one occasion, that he apologize, in one way or another, or else we would halt the dialogue with the Vatican.

The catch: China was completely closed to foreigners. Britain had just whupped them in the first opium war, so they weren't exactly friendly to Europeans. But in 1848, the British East India Company charged Fortune, an ambitious botanist from Scotland, with the task of sneaking into China and stealing tea plants. And we're not just talking about throwing a few seedlings into a gunny sack and jumping back aboard a clipper; Fortune made two journeys into the interior of China — in disguise — to dig up, package and haul out several hundred tea plants, plus convincing some Chinese tea makers to join him and bring their knowledge to the West. And he was largely successful.

Harriet needs to receive some credit for my blogging absence. The little miss Inexhaustible has been making valiant attempts to ditch the morning nap (AHH!) thus denying me the hour or so of uninterrupted typing time. I'm not really sure what to do about the morning nap ditch. On some days it's easy to go with the flow: she gets up later (8:30am), messes around all morning, and takes an early afternoon nap. But on other days the lack of nappage is like scraping my fingernails over a chalkboard. Harriet whines if she doesn't sleep and whines if I try to get her to go to sleep. And I sit on the bed staring at her theatrics and praying for patience.
The fifth joyful mystery is the finding of Jesus in the Temple. This scene also comes from the second chapter of Luke, when Jesus is twelve years old. Before he was found, however, he was lost. Mary and Joseph did not find him until the third day. The search for the lost Jesus is the third of Mary’s seven sorrows.

The audience I have in mind are those Christians, pastors, and churches that continue to affirm the basic contours of evangelical faith. They've never read Fosdick or Tillich or Schleiermacher. They don't read the Christian Century. They don't know much about Deutero- or Trito-Isaiah and don't really care to waste any more time with documentary hypotheses. They think Paul wrote Ephesians and John wrote John. They love Jesus and want other people to love Jesus. If you ask these Christians, pastors, or churches if hell is forever and people must be born again, they'll say yes. If you ask them whether you can trust everything in the Bible, they wouldn't dare say no. They have no problem with any of the historic creeds and confessions. The people and institutions I have in mind gladly affirm penal substitution, the bodily resurrection of Christ, and a real historical Fall. The folks I want to address are energetic about evangelism. They want to see churches planted and people come to Christ. They think small groups, accountability partners, and mission trips are excellent. And at least in private conversation they'll tell you that homosexuality is not. These Christians, pastors, and churches are not liberal. They don't feel like one of the bad guys.

With drums pounding and chants filling the air, the ANC president, Jacob Zuma, initiated the traditional cleansing ceremony by ritually sacrificing a bull, killing it with a spear, while it was tied to a tree. ANC secretary general, Gwede Mantashe, explained: "traditionally the act of slaughtering has different meanings. All nations have a way of celebration through slaughter... it is the same but in different circumstances." The inter-faith service included messages and blessings from representatives of all major religions, including Muslim, Hindu, Christian, Rastafarian, and traditional Animist witchdoctors. Despite the ANC, chaplain general's assertion that "all nations have a way of celebration through slaughter" journalists could not think of how the Queen of England, for example, marks national events by ritual slaughter of a helpless animal.

The basic premise is a familiar one, various forms having been used over the years in a variety of films. There’s a young woman on vacation who meets a mysterious yet attractive stranger, falls in love, marries and, after a time, discovers that all is not what it initially seemed. The woman in this particular movie is Celia (Joan Bennett), an heiress who’s recently found herself alone in the world and has taken off on a trip to Mexico before returning to the States and settling down to a life of bland respectability. However, Celia is not the usual, run-of-the-mill innocent abroad. Contrary to appearances, there’s a darker, almost perverse, side to her nature that soon becomes apparent. Quite by chance, she witnesses the flare-up of a knife fight between two local men. This isn’t some matter of slighted honour, more a duel of passion; the men are vying for the affections of a woman. Instead of doing the sensible thing and walking away, Celia is rooted to the spot, fascinated by the events before her. The viewer isn’t the only one struck by the hungry, predatory look in Celia’s eyes as she absorbs this primitive ritual – another bystander’s attention is drawn to her. He is Mark Lamphere (Michael Redgrave), an architect of patrician background. To cut to the chase, Celia and Mark fall in love, marry and move back to his out-of-town home in the States. Even before they leave Mexico though, it’s apparent that all isn’t well with Mark; he has a tendency to withdraw from intimacy without explanation. As the couple embark on their new life the skeletons begin to rattle in the family cupboard and, bit by bit, secrets and hints of a dark past start to emerge. Celia’s husband is a deeply troubled man who appears to have a morbid obsession both with historical murders and the rooms in which those crimes took place, while questions linger over the death of his first wife. The true roots of the problem are not immediately obvious but, even so, the new bride slowly comes to suspect that her own life may be in danger.
The only released version of this song was recorded in September 1983 for a Peel session, at the BBC. For whatever reason the band chose to record a full-blown studio version in June 1984 during the "William, It Was Really Nothing" sessions, but never did anything with it (it was meant to be a B-side along with the July '84 "Rusholme Ruffians" recording, backing a proposed-yet-binned "Nowhere Fast" single which also was recorded in June/July 1984). If anything, time gave Moz a chance to get a bit more confident with his vocal, but it's not significantly different overall besides being a bit faster. Still a nice find though...
am hoping to have a little play with that later today.
"We took the divergent path," explained Frank Cooper, chief consumer engagement officer for Pepsi. "We wanted to explore how a brand could be integrated into the digital space."The idea behind the program was that you, the consumer, got to engage with Pepsi by voting for the "Refresh" projects you deemed most worthy. There were also other opportunities to engage through an enormous online effort -- Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, website, blogs. Millions of dollars were also spent in what might be called "traditional advertising in support of social media."

I wish I could bottle these moments when they are each other's best friend.

Obviously, they had not heard John the Baptist’s identification of him on the day of baptism. They were not there as Father affirmed him as “Son” from heaven and the Spirit descended upon him. They were not privy to the 40 days of isolation and consecration in the wilderness. The battle and ultimate victory he had achieved against the Tempter had not been reported to them. They only knew that somehow, someway, Joseph’s boy had built a reputation for himself because he walked in a peculiar authority and read the scriptures with in a manner in which they had never experienced.

The Mentor/Shadow program should be obvious – in a country this large we need to develop as many top level coaches in every discipline that we can across the nation. I would even look to develop Regional Coaches Directories, along with Regional Coaching Development Programs that put coaches like John Smith, Alberto Salazar, Bobby Kersee, and Dick Booth together with their peers to exchange information/techniques. This should be mandatory for all coaches who want to work on international programs – because we want to replicate their success, we want as many athletes as possible benefiting from their knowledge. Similarly the Athlete Referral program would take elite athletes and put them in touch with coaches that can help shore up their weaknesses. For example, while a Walter Dix has his own coach, he (and his coach) could be referred to Jon Drummond for analysis and tweaking of his start mechanics. Again, without disrespect to their personal coaches, acceptance of referrals should almost be a mandatory component of competing on international teams. As we want those athletes competing in the Red, White and Blue competing at their absolute maximum potential.

Now there are more changes as sites such as Facebook and Flickr mean that photographs are easily available to everyone. I have to keep a keen eye on Facebook along with everyone else to see the first images. This is wonderful, but also means that we cannot keep images exclusive to those who perhaps 'deserve' to see them first. The hardworking Area Co-ordinators and drivers who are the driving force behind getting the boxes to the children should perhaps be the first to see the first child get a box, but it is sadly no longer possible to do this. Such is progress: we re-balance our expectations to accommodate changes which can only be to the good.

We wandered up to MacGregor’s Folly. MacGregor in about 1900 decided to give the stone masons employment over the quiet, jobless winter months. He had them build a collescium up above the town. It is three levels high of of a stone circle with arches. Had he lived longer, it would have been 40/50 metres high, with museum and art gallery nearby and statues of himself and family within.

He's not sporting the current mod kid hairstyle, he's not wearing anything remotely trendy or hip. He's supposed to be a nerd. And the Highlander kid is telling him this, in his own way.
The first time I saw Tangled, I was completely unimpressed. I thought the story was ok, but the songs just fell flat for me. I have no idea why I thought this, but upon a great many rewatchings, I grew to love everything about: the characters, the songs, and those small moments you only notice after watching it at least a dozen times. Something just clicked in me and I fell in love with the film. The characters are dynamic and wonderful. Rapunzel is incredibly naive because she's never been in the outside world, but she definitely isn't stupid. Her naivete and kindness actually helps them cross the land to the castle to see the lanterns of her dreams. Plus her hair gets them out of a lot of sticky situations. Flynn Rider is a cocky, egotistical, self serving jerk on the outside, but a sweetheart on the inside. I really liked that their relationship is built on friendship and getting to know each other as opposed to the typical fairy tale instalove. Pascal, Rapunzel's pet chameleon, is just about the cutest thing ever and plays an instrumental role in the story. Maximus, the horse bent on capturing Flynn, is more like a dog than a horse, which was kind of weird, but still cute.

Hendrix fans amongst you will recognise the above as lyrics from Bold as Love, the title track of Jimi's second album. According to the sleevenotes (from a long-lost cassette, so you'll have to trust my memory on this), the concept for the song was the idea of using emotions to describe colours to a blind person. The more obvious interpretation is that Hendrix was using colours as a metaphorical device to describe his own conflicting emotions.

For the better part of this book, the romance was almost non-existent. Granted, I knew and expected were things were headed between Jeremy and Mia but the romance was only hinted, so it would make much more sense if things progressed in a much slower pace between them. After all, the whole story takes place in four days, so for two people to fall so helplessly in love so quickly while fighting for their lives, strikes as unbelievable to say the least. So, for about the first half of the book, things are going in a pace that makes sense and then suddenly the whole story takes an unexpected romantic turn that kind of felt like the author decided that it was about time that the romance should bloom between her two heroes and be done with it. It's just that one day Mia doesn't even know what to thing of Jeremy and his motives and the next day she trusts him completely and invites him for a sleepover...

I can also tell you that this is not an aberration as was evidenced by The Susan G. Komen debacle earlier this year. Earlier this week, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant signed into law a bill that effectively shuts down the state’s last remaining abortion clinic. Just yesterday, the House of Representatives approved a $33 billion cut in food assistance programs over the next 10 years and, while it will likely rot on the Senate floor, it shows the frame of mind we are in as a nation. It gives a person pause to think about what it means to be an American, a community member and an individual. Listening to political rhetoric, one could come away with the impression that the three things are mutually exclusive.
Many corporations are faced with a dilemma. In many cases, the founder of a company may not recognize the need for an organizational vision as business changes. Leadership often tolerates inefficiencies, especially when “fire drills” are often case. Often, leadership they understand the history, inception and evolution of the organization since its founding, to may not have a clear understanding regarding its next steps.

Well, if Paul were president, he would be the opposite of that. And although he does have the power to send troops on an emergency basis anywhere, the power of declaring war sits firmly with Congress, and in recent years they have demanded that they be able to authorize or reject any action taken solely by the president.
A strong rally propelled global equity markets during the first quarter of 2012. Improving economic data in the U.S. and much of the world, easing sovereign debt tensions in Europe and an increased willingness by investors to put money into riskier assets were the major catalysts for rising markets. For many stock markets, it was the best first quarter in more than a decade.

Again, just another game I grumble at. Not exactly the worst, just sometimes……goes bad. Levels are too easy/hard, and I’m not a fan of the gameplay or controls. The fact that marked boxes can’t be demolished provides a safety factor (if you get the mark right), but even so, it makes the game a lot less suspenseful than it ought to be. The guy is weird in an oddly entertaining way, and that keeps this game from getting a 1.0 rating. As well, you can interact with your sculptures, and that’s entertaining. But it still gets a medium-low rating from me.

Not all political anger is about showmanship. In one of PoliWood’s highlights, the mostly liberal members of the Creative Coalition sit down with conservative delegates at the Republican convention. Their interaction is civil but intense and several of the conservative speakers take the Hollywood figures to task for what they perceived as arrogant condescension. As actress Rachel Leigh Cook later reflects, the scolding was not intended to impress others; these people were genuinely angry because they felt marginalized and ignored. The protests of this scene are not really about the celebrities; these people are lashing out in frustration because they are immersed in political debate but they are also alienated from the institutions that are supposed to represent them. That this was filmed in mid-2008, well before the Tea Party and the Occupy movements, makes the footage a fascinating preview of future events. In the context of a discussion about politics and media, it reveals something that the infotainment establishment often misses: the way in which the voices of average people are drowned out by the rancor of political spectacle.
Houda’s idea is that a woman can be whoever as long as she’s first there to prepare all the meals, keep the house clean, teach the kids, and so on. 24/7 sexual availability is a big part of this, too, because a woman’s duties to the household extend to the marital bed. The husband’s word is law: Houda explicitly says she would not encourage a woman to study/work if her spouse forbade it. This is a view many Muslim women I personally know hold, albeit watered-down versions of it (thankfully), and it’s what I was taught.
"But it's really hard to get into Veterinary Science," I told him, and Dr. Guoqing smiled and said he knew. "It's not the case in China," he said, "a neighbour told me that I'd never find a wife if I did veterinary science, and so I didn't want to do it."

Let’s start with the good. While there are few devices with stand-out names, it’s not difficult to pick them out, because, well, they stand out. The most iconic and instantly-recognizable in the modern tech bubble is the iPhone. Such a simple name, yet simultaneously such a profound choice. While seemingly an obvious name for Apple’s revolutionary phone, the name is quite clever, actually. The use of the “i” prefix ensures a continuation of Apple’s brand. Starting with the iMac, and followed up with the iPod, the “i” trademark has become synonymous with anything Apple. Thus, the choice to stick it in front of “Phone” was a natural one. Apple built up a force to be reckoned with in its heavy marketing of the iSomething devices. The long history of customer satisfaction with products bearing this single letter prefix is like a wave, carrying any new product up to the top, almost immediately.

The avarice of the early '90s would lead to the downfalls of the Limelight's main characters. Alig would be charged with murdering fellow club kid Angel Melendez. Gatien was arrested on drug charges in 1996 -- by then, the Limelight was a veritable candy store for ecstacy and 'special k' -- and in 1999 for tax evasion. Alig is in prison, serving a 20-year sentence; Gatien is in Canada, presumably forever.

ZP: Slowly. Gareth has been very busy with Los Campesinos! stuff, and we kind of lost touch after a while, but he finally got back in touch and finally announced his attention to be a part of this project. I’ve got a bunch of songs for it, but nothing that’s been finished, but we’ve committed to finishing a record by the end of the year, to ourselves. I’m very, very excited about it. I really love both those guys a lot, and I think the project been really fun. I’ve also been working on this project with my very good friend Claudia Meza who use to be in group called Explode into Color, who are no long but were a Kill Rock Stars band for a bit and we’ve been working on a new project for a bit that will hopefully get out sooner rather than later.

When your body burns or tans it’s a reaction by your cells to the sun. If you’re as red as a lobster, congratulations you’ve just killed your skin cells. As a result, when your burn finally peels away, the new skin cells will be slightly darker than the ones you just burned off. It is your body’s way of protecting itself. The pigment of you skin cells are caused by melanin and the amount your body produces really depends on genetics, so that pretty much dictates how your skin is going to react.

In the Hudson Valley region of New York State the daffodils are in full bloom and spring has officially arrived according to the calendar. Just two weeks ago we had temperatures in the high 70s low 80s, but are back down to the high 30s low 40s for the last week. Even though, we've taken the time out to clean the deck and patio and furniture for both. I'm looking forward to moving my morning ritual outside in the coming weeks and enjoying our yard before the hustle and bustle of the day.
What I want to say to the Cousin is: Are you fucking kidding me? Have you been watching Dr. Jenny McCarthy lately? What you are describing is chelation therapy, and yes I’ve heard of it, as well as the 100+ therapies out there marketed to desperate parents of children with autism. Did you ask your stupid friends how much of their life savings they’ve shelled out for this miracle therapy? Have I tried chelation therapy? No, but I have tried lots of other shit that had no effect from the Wilbarger protocol to hippotherapy. Don’t you think if mercury was known as the universal cure that autism wouldn’t exist? My son needs understanding, not a cure. He needs love, not judgment! Just because you know someone who has a child with autism does not mean you have any insight into my personal experience. Stop making casual conversation with me unless you’re going to say something intelligent. Fuck you! Oh, and sorry you have breast cancer. That sucks.
The more detailed answer would’ve been, “I love you and just I spent twelve hours yesterday not knowing if you were in jail, had run out of the courtroom and thrown yourself in front of a bus, or if you were ok, and if you weren’t ok, I had absolutely no idea of ever knowing if I would ever find out what happened to you or what had happened to you and I didn’t really handle any of these things well.”
In a recent article in the Chicago Sun Times an African American writer called John W Fountain details his objections to being addressed as “Bud”, which, as I understand it is the American equivalent of the Anglo/Australian term “Mate”. To Mr Fountain, oblivious apparently to the fact that in vast swaths of blue collar America just about every male is known as “Bud”, the term is a post-racial form of “boy” used by racist white Americans who can not bring themselves to address a black man as “Sir”. Mr. Fountain's article goes some way to proving that, as many have long suspected that the real meaning of “racism” can be just about anything that an over sensitive black man wants it to be.

In a double-dweller cottage between this factory and the wood circle by Great-grandfather Peachey had his home. This was where he kept the ferrets that were an essential tool of his trade of warrener. My father, as a young boy, used to poke their pink noses through the cage with pieces of straw. Once, while out with his Grandfather in the Arminghall fields, he was told to go with a stick and hit a wounded rabbit over the head. To Great-grandfather’s disgust he was unable to do so.
Both boys are such little monkeys. They can get on anything! Now, they're able to pull out the chairs and climb up. I found out the hard way that I can't keep my purse or the diaper bag on the dining room table anymore. Evan pulled my purse down and was going through it the other day. Evan can also open any door now, so we had to put those annoying child proof things on all the doors. We already had them on the main doors (like the one to the basement) because we knew he was close to figuring it out.
I love how the Walmart website states that students will "enjoy nutritionally well-balanced foods like breakfast wraps, yogurt, or fruit.."

Commercial cultured buttermilk: Commercial buttermilks are cultured milk, as above, made from pastuerized and homogenized milk. Typically, in the US, 1 1/2% milk is used. Often, there are thickeners such as carregeenan. It does have live cultures, and is acidic. Commercial buttermilks contain probiotics, and are low fat. Sometimes, when substituting homemade cultured buttermilk for commercial buttermilk in gluten-free baking recipes, I find it helpful to add a 1/2-1 teaspoon of ground flax to compensate for the thickeners in commercial buttermilk.

The message is not only that ability and talent alone will be insufficient for success but that our approach to the everyday challenges we face will actually make the difference. Dr. Dweck focuses two different attitudes or “mindsets” that we will most likely choose to use–a fixed mindset vs. a growth mindset. And that choice can be life altering. That is to say that with the growth mindset there is the understanding that people can change and the leader can help that positive change take place, or with the fixed mindset the leader works with the perception that people are the way they are and nothing can be done about it. In this text the examples are myriad. That is one of the reasons it reads so well. The reader will find this book to be instructional, motivational, and maybe even a bit discomfiting.

Against Mbeki’s reserved style, there is Zuma’s unbuttoned conduct, dancing half naked in tribal dress.

It has been suggested that Zuma has done for South Africa’s international image what Borat Sagdiyev has done for Kazakhstan. With one distinction: Borat is a fictitious character, the product of Sacha Baron Cohen’s comedic genius; Zuma is “for real.”

You may have noticed that in her comments on last weeks' post, KATHY over at OREGON GIFTS OF COMFORT AND JOY suggested it might be a good idea to have a Sepia Saturday Facebook Group. It is indeed a good idea and one KAT MORTENSEN had when we first set up Sepia Saturday a couple of years ago. She kindly set up such a group and it has been lying fallow ever since. It can be found by doing a group search for Sepia Saturday or by (hopefully) following THIS LINK. If you use Facebook why not join the group and we can use it to exchange old images and chat about all things sepia. If you don't use Facebook or if you prefer the larger image formats available on Flickr I have also set up a Flickr Sepia Saturday Group which once again we can use to share our images. Again, you should be able to locate it via a group search or (again, hopefully) by following THIS LINK. Thus the Sepia Saturday brand goes remorselessly onward and next week I hope to announce the launch of a range of branded Sepia Saturday underwear!

For starters, the local cuisine is Tibetan; the thukpa (noodle soup), sephaley (meat rolls) and tsampa (roasted barley flour).
Eggs are a great ingredient to build a meal around. You could make a Swiss cheese and mushroom quiche, or an omelet with cheese and tomatoes. Meatless pasta dishes are another option--how about spinach lasagna, or spaghetti with marinara sauce? Indian samosas can be made with a potato and pea filling, maybe served alongside a chickpea curry. Something as simple as tomato soup and grilled cheese is a good vegetarian meal. Rather than a deprivation, eating vegetarian can be a delicious adventure!

I'm hard on myself too. Here I am - it is Tuesday after I've gotten out of school on Friday. I had worked 12 days straight including Saturday and Sunday - the last four days I worked for around 18 hours a piece finishing up the graduation movie and here I am on Tuesday making a list a mile long and wondering why I'm so tired.
This year I am having to focus a bit harder on my job just to keep up and since that is what is paying the attorney fees and bills right now that is where I am putting my focus. Even though I know for a fact that I am more productive and happier when I get out and move my body.
Please continue to look after us!! ♥

It's time to assemble, to make the sandwich you need 2 slices of English Muffin, 1 egg, 1 slice of cheese and 1 slice of meat. Put it all toegther and then lay flat on a cookie sheet to freeze. I like to freeze these for about an hour, this will let all the moisture out and get them ready to wrap in foil.
I like to prep my griddle with a light coating of vegetable oil, then I melt a small amount of butter, for flavor. I also use a 1/4 cup measuring cup so that my pancakes are evenly sized. The bottom of the measuring cup helps to spread the batter evenly.

“The Bowker statistics do show another significant growth area in the non-traditional category—the role publishers like BiblioBazaar (272,930 titles), Books LLC (224,460) and Kessinger Publishing LLC (190,175 titles) are playing in the publishing industry. Take out just these three publishers from the non-traditional equation, and the resulting 76,883 does not look quite so dominating for all those author solutions services. What remains a factor, which cannot be ignored, in spite of the three noted publishers above, is the extraordinary rate of growth in the non-traditional category—a 181% increase on the 2008 figure.”

The first taste tells me that the smoked fish is still there, but now it is accompanied with smoked bacon. Afterwards the smoky feeling stays in the mouth. The crisps on my plate taste less, and the Danish gräddost cheese is more or less tasteless.
I must have been about the same age when I went to our corner shop with a girl from school, who began to demonstrate her own much more practiced method of shoplifting. I was beyond shocked, and though we didn't use the phrase 'comfort zone' then, I knew enough to know that I was out of mine. As a child, I was terrified and regretful even when I hadn't even done anything. The most exciting thing I remember doing was walking to the other side of my village with my friend Joanne. It was so far away! (Over half a mile!) We came back, giggling uncontrollably and amazed at how far we could reach in the world.
A couple of weeks ago a lone man tried to get 3 of 4 into his car, promising a ride home from her bus stop. I now meet the bus every afternoon. It's a shame that a 12 year old can't walk a block without a problem. I'd like to think it's just a kindly neighbour making a friendly offer, but now a days a lone middle aged male in a car alone should know better. It was a beautiful, sunny day and she was close to home, no need to offer. She didn't recognize the man as being from the area.

I have previously defined Hyperinflation for the American dollar as beginning at 25% because it is a reserve currency. In the 18th century colonials had to either earn English pounds or gold coins to buy things from overseas. In 2011 people in Asia who wanted to buy oil had to earn US dollars to make purchases from the Mideast. In 2013 the US inflation rate will hit 25% which is Hyperinflationary. People who hold dollars will lose tens of billions of dollars every month. This will prompt an international conference at which the dollar will be devalued and the Chinese yuan will be increased in value. This will overnight make WalMart a very expensive place for Americans to shop. The devaluation of the dollar plus the accumulated inflation since January of 2012 will cut American wages in half by the summer of 2013 give or take a few months.
Actual human-filled events happened in 2010 including weddings, (two, one that is corked so hard and one that was such a spectacle in all sorts of fashions), illnesses, special gifts (as in Apple special), human kindnesses done to me, really annoying things done to me, death of a friend’s loved one, heart attacks, heart conditions of friends’ families, actual feelings felt for family, etc, etc. These were all important to me and I want to relish or pick life lessons off them but 2010, it also made me realize how incapable I am of assigning importance to what really makes life meaningful, illegal downloads or people. It’s a tough choice so maybe it’s best not to submit them for scrutiny, yes? Yes.
this is still a little touchy for me since it only happened a few weeks ago, but long story short, my husband went to the hospital after we realized his heart was beating "off rhythm" and he was feeling some pressure in his chest. after a long night in the ER and eventually ending up in ICU, the doctors decided he needed to see a cardiologist for an "a-fib".
Thanks for reading.
It paints a bleak picture of an administration in shambles where corruption, misspending and flagrant abuse of public money is the order of the day.
My main thought today will be taken from a very familiar passage in the Book of Philippians, chapter four. As we get ready to read this passage, who remembers where Paul wrote this particular letter from… a Roman prison. For the last four years he has been in miserable conditions dealing with the worst possible circumstances. He’s spent two years in prison in Caesarea for a trumped up charge. Then he’s put on a ship to go to Rome to appear before Nero who is not known for his niceties towards Christians. On the way he’s shipwrecked, stranded on an island, bitten by a poisonous snake, waits the winter there, continues on to Rome, spends another two years in prison awaiting trial to be executed. During this two year period in Rome he is chained to a guard for 24 hours a day.

It was another unseasonably beautiful day that evening, and after the session we held hands and walked through a park. We went for dinner together, and then back to the park where we sat on a bench and talked. We spent 4 1/2 hours together. I returned home alone and without resolution, but I allowed myself some hope.

Unfortunately, Jason and I don't have too many pictures of just the two of us.Once you have a kid, you find that most of your pictures are of either you or your spouse with your child. Since I don't think it'd be a great idea to teach Aidan how to use our expensive camera, we don't have very many pictures of Jason and I together.
You also have to think about the upkeep of a home. Everything from cutting the grass to putting on a new roof is your responsibility. The costs can really add up. Then add taxes, water and sewer bills and other expenses and you can get into some sizable payments.
Mark Richt heard the man loud and clear, waited for him to finish and answered.
The enemy of the men’s movement is not the women’s movement. The enemy of the men’s movement is man himself. Systematically man has denied his fellow men of God’s gifts of feeling, of understanding more emotive acts than simply momentary annoyance and aggression.
It’s Shoji White by Sherwin Williams. I know, I know. But, after living with the blue swatches on the wall for a week or so, I started to feel like it might be too much. Considering how much more chaotic our lives are getting ready to be in another few months, I kept finding myself drawn back to images of calming, neutral rooms.
I am trying to do that now too. I am trying to teach my kids how to heal from a bad situation. I want them to learn lessons from my mistakes and also give them skills to cope with life, the good and the bad.

At age 72, I have been spared major injuries and sickness. Other than birth, I have never spent a night in a hospital, but I paid a visit a few years back for a common ailment of men of my age. I was in and out of surgery the same day.

When appearing as members of their order, they wore a garb of sanctity, visiting prisons and hospitals, ministering to the sick and the poor, professing to have renounced the world, and bearing the sacred name of Jesus, who went about doing good. But under this blameless exterior the most criminal and deadly purposes were often concealed. It was a fundamental principle of the order that the end justifies the means. By this code, lying, theft, perjury, assassination, were not only pardonable but commendable, when they served the interests of the church. Under various disguises the Jesuits worked their way into offices of state, climbing up to be the counselors of kings, and shaping the policy of nations. They became servants to act as spies upon their masters. They established colleges for the sons of princes and nobles, and schools for the common people; and the children of Protestant parents were drawn into an observance of popish rites. All the outward pomp and display of the Romish worship was brought to bear to confuse the mind and dazzle and captivate the imagination, and thus the liberty for which the fathers had toiled and bled was betrayed by the sons. The Jesuits rapidly spread themselves over Europe, and wherever they went, there followed a revival of popery." - E. G. White, The Great Controversy, pp. 234, 235, 1911, Pacific Press Publishing Assn.
“Just a bit of advice. Don’t presume Barry. I plan to hang those clothes up in her closet. And stack the shoes in her closet. That’s my plan. And you have fucked it up!” he said pushing the parking break down, gearing up and turning out fast into the street.

He added that the Yankees will seek electricity discounts, even as other public projects, notably the mass transit system, need capital. So that raises “fundamental political concerns” regarding whether public processes need to change. The single strongest argument, Brodsky said, “is the one you haven’t made, or hardly made: the federal government takes more money from us than they give back.”

The Scandinavians call kick sledding, "sparking." Well, that's what I'm told, but I'm not sure it sounds the same in Norwegian. Some Scandinavians commute to work and school with kick sleds. We have some kick sleds here at Dodge that the Preschoolers and visiting school agers use, but you can try out this great cardio activity too. Dodge hosts events like Frosty Fun, when the general public can have at our kick sleds, but some local parks also provide kick sleds for your pleasure. Visit Lebanon Hills Regional Park in Eagan and glide over a frozen lake or plan a longer route and pack a snow picnic. Mountain Boy company makes a home grown version and the Hearth Song and Magic Cabin retailers sell kick sleds too.

You all have no idea how much I wanted to offer to buy it for her but knew I had to set boundaries. If I bought one mom a dress how could I not do it for each mom who came into the store who did not have the money. I am sure you are wondering why being it was Saint Vincent De Pauls I did not just give her the dress. We do give clothing but we give needed/necessity clothing and items. I could not start this habit at the store.

Then I will want to draft out the whole series – which may be a few years worth of writing. Then I’ll edit and make sure they all at least match and don’t contradict each other, so perhaps add another year.

The Blessed Damozel has often been said to be about Rossetti’s wife – the deceased heavenly female figure in the poem. Rossetti was somewhat haunted by her ghostly presence, as he was by those of the other two women in his life. This added another dimension to his work, a more eerie and foreboding one. Although his subjects ranged from classical, biblical, historical, and literary, and often the ethereal and romantic mood prevailed, his female subjects were often portrayed as seemingly innocent yet obdurate seductresses charming the male to his end. Perhaps Rossetti adhered to the antediluvian belief that the great fall of man rests at the hands of a woman. But who can say? Rossetti’s poems, like his paintings, are beautiful, at times remarkably so and characterised by the themes which shaped the poet’s own life, namely love and death.
My force have had various requests over the last year or so from individuals and organisations regarding the operation of the Mental Health Act involving the police. Last week, you may have seen a short BBC Newsnight piece concerning deaths in police custody during which Freedom of Information Act figures were mentioned. The BBC sought figures from every force in England and Wales on their operation of s136 Mental Health Act and details of where individuals who were arrested were taken (hospitals or police station). It was nice to send it back saying over 90% of people detained go to hospitals, which puts us in one of the best places in the country.
Today recipe is very special one for me, it was dream to make this kind of layered mousse cake, I spend days in other versatile food pages seeing and getting inspired. When I saw Mango event in Tanvi's Sinfully Spicy, when I saw the book she is going to give as the gift I knew what I have to make. So here is guys, I wanted to try the way I could handle, by keep it extremely simple and very subtle. Base cake (mango saffron olive oil cake) I tried couple of months before when mum went back to India made it for my sis, she was singing glories of it so wanted to it make it for myself....it is fantastic! When I made it for my sis, used normal cooking oil but for the competition made it olive oil, since I didn't taste it last time, not sure if there was change in taste, but I believe there shouldn't be much. I'm submitting it for the Mango event.

Dr Internet isn't helpful either... it kind of makes it worse (have you looked at pink eye pictures. YUCK!) Joshua informed me his eyes aren't sick anymore but mine still are! I thought mine looked better than his!
In addition to helping your child understand why bullying occurs, you need to teach him or her how to deal with it when it does occur. As adults we know that bullies will pass over kids that do not react to their bullying in favour of kids who make the bullying more entertaining by becoming upset. Keeping this in mind, if the abuse is only verbal, teach your children to hold their head up high, walk away and ignore the bully. Teach your child to be proud of whom he/she is. She/he should know they are a wonderful person that should be treated with respect. Thus positive reinforcement is essential when assisting your child to face negativity from others.
Another important Coney Island export to the world of vaudeville. Just as the Steeplechase Tilyous gave us the Surf Theater (which is really just a footnote), Frederic Thompson and Elmer Dundee, the owners and designers of LunaPark, created two of vaudeville’s most important theaters, the Colonial and the Hippodrome, both built in 1905.

The shots were taken in our kitchen and the idea was to tell a story..For the eye to register that a Provencal kitchen is the heart of this home, that this kitchen is not only for cooking but for eating and socialising...this is a place to talk farming and to talk family. The small details...the polished wooden table top, the peak of terracotta tiles, the hand picked lime-blossom in the glass canisters, the painted ladder back chairs with traditional woven straw seats, the light switches, the cabinetry, the parchment light shades...all tell a Provencal tale...
5. Running puts things in perspective: I’ve noticed recently that I’ve increasingly had more and more conversations with friends about some very serious and life-altering topics, which has given me pause. There is just something about sharing the road with someone that compels you to open up and share, and not only do I have the amazing opportunity to lend a listening ear, but I’m left with a greater feeling of purpose regarding my own role in the world.
I feel so torn right now. I would love to have a Snow Day and the chances of having one are quickly coming to an end for this school year. I would love to go to school tomorrow. My students are so excited for our Leap Day celebration. I am pretty excited for the day, too! Our frogs are ready to be named. Ten random colored frogs are hidden in bags ready to be graphed. Measuring tape is ready to measure the length of said frogs leaps. I'm just not sure how I should pray...
This commitment to supporting my children's passions involves a great deal of trust. Trust that they really know what is right for them and trust that I am capable when their passions push me out of my comfort zone. This week has had big moments of trust. One of our daughter's heard an ad on the radio about talent scouts who were coming to our area. We went on-line and checked it out as best we could. We talked about what the experience might be like and what the possibilities were that it could actually lead to her ending up with an agent and an acting career. We really didn't know what to expect, but our entire family went with her to the event. We listened, took notes, and when it was her turn she walked up to the table. The scout asked her a few questions. She gave him confident answers. He saw within her the passion, the desire, the confidence that this was what she was meant to be doing. Next thing we knew we were sitting down again listening to the realities of being parents to a child actor. Those realities don't exactly mesh with my comfort zone.

In America we have a very resilient and robust Wall Street; and a downcast and depressed Main Street. And the object of the game is to keep the downcast Main Street (99%ers) ignorant to what is going on. They keep the low information voters busy with the stupid stuff, the crazy political issues that are not real issues at all. Instead of doing their political homework they inadequately attempt to entertain and persuade with simplistic talking points and slogans and misinformation email forwards. This is an intellect insult to the ones that know better — the ones doing their political homework. But more importantly, unbeknownst to the unaware, it is an intellect insult to them too.

Reading what were contemporary novels when they were written, but are now 'classics' offer us a way to time travel. Austen is a favourite writer of mine; her wit is surprising to us, given the ponderous length of her sentences. But her sentence length is just when she was. Her wit is what she was. She was a product of her time as much as we are and we can visit that time by opening her books. She noticed, named and recorded the early nineteenth century

Rather, the goal of each is to impress on us that hell is a very bad place! Hell is everything which is opposite of what God wants for humanity. In fact, the term hell itself metaphorically expresses this. Hell in Greek is gehenna, and gehenna was a valley outside of Jerusalem which was used as the city’s major dump. What ends up in hell, the biblical authors are saying, is simply the refuse of humanity.

2) The Righteous Path Through The Forest of Old – Mammatus – from “Mammatus”
All murders are awful acts of barbarity, and nobody deserves to die, however, in terms of the cruelty of the act, Stephen's murder was over in moments, whilst Kriss's killing dragged on over hours and involved horrific suffering and torture.
This decision was seen as a "dramatic expansion" of the double patenting doctrine. The judicially-created double patenting doctrine prevents a patentee from receiving two patents for one invention. However, when a second patent covers matter described in a prior patent, the second patent is still valid so long as the invention is patentably distinct from the invention claimed in the first patent. By applying the doctrine in this case, it was argued that the CAFC limited Eli Lilly to one patent for two inventions.
“I felt slammed into the sudden weight of my meat on the bed the rasp of breathing, reeling as sounds returned and the room jigsawed itself backward out of the void, like a kit assembled by my opening eyes. The sense of loss, the fall from heaven, was heartbreaking, but it was my origin story too – my personal induction into the cosmic corps, the army of light.”

In 1809 Newcastle Corporation bought the keep and provided it with a roof and battlements. In addition the private dwellings within the castle boundaries were demolished. In the mid 19th century the arrival of the railway in Newcastle led to a viaduct to be constructed to the north of the keep and crossing the site of the castle. As a result, only the keep and the Black Gate now remain. The Black Gate is so called after Patrick Black, a tenant there in the 17th century. About that time a brick house, with mullioned and transomed windows was erected on top of the original, fortified gate.

While thinking about how to talk about springtime eating, I kept coming back to poached eggs. I recently learned how to poach eggs and I've become rather addicted to the process. A well poached egg is delicate and ephemeral, a fluffy and yet solid white pouch holding a vibrant pool of yellow. You have to eat it fast and parsley is a necessity. A sprinkle of salt, and, if you are feeling decadent, the redundancy of freshly made hollandaise sauce is very springtime-in-Paris. Free ranging chickens start laying again as day length increases. Spring. Barnyard chickens are happy chickens and it is nice to eat the egg of a happy chicken (I think it tastes better too), even if it feels as though you are "poaching" that hen's egg.

Bursting out of the titty-covered barn like a rabid tapir with things to do, the opening montage is jam-packed with gaudy images that scratched me where I itch from a stylistic point-of-view. (Spotting a woman dressed as Columbia from the Rocky Horror Picture Show in the opening montage was like a lighthouse, signaling to me that it was safe to continue watching.) Establishing its time and place, after hours on Sunset Boulevard (a.k.a. The Sunset Strip), the film shows a series of street level vignettes depicting a society drowning in a lukewarm, parasite-ridden pool of its own filth. Of course, I found the decay to be downright charming. If wearing legwarmers, high heel shoes, short shorts, sequined halter tops, excessive eye makeup, studded dog collars and leaning seductively into the passenger side windows of parked cars is against the law, then arrest me at once, because I'm guilty on all counts.

Just a quick post today; I’m on the road in Cambodia, visiting friends in Siem Reap and Phnom Penh. The plan was also to go to Battambang for a day or two, but the Try brothers changed their minds and decided to stay longer in Siem Reap (where they used to live, and where I first met them 10 years ago) to visit friends of their own. No problem for me; it saves having to book more transportation and hotel rooms. Plus, it’s nice to actually relax and do not much of anything for a day or two.
Of course I snapped pictures of some crazies for you!

He didn’t expect anything to go wrong, of course, but that didn’t mean nothing would. He was optimistic that Director Lorovic would uphold his end of their bargain. If Hesha and her closest supporters could be kept out of the Senate Hall, even for a few hours, Drahzen would be able to seize the initiative and bring her weaker supporters and those senators who were still undecided over to his side. If Lorovic was true to his word, then Drahzen would be able to surge ahead in the vote and build an insurmountable lead before Hesha would even be able to make her case. And if Lorovic didn’t come through…well, his career would be over.

Yes, they live with less "stuff" and that does make for a simpler, less cluttered life. But it's the reason behind it that is so compelling to me: they seek to create margin in their life. Not just empty space but space that is available to nourish family, community, and faith. Their Christmas is far less elaborate than yours or mine, but what they do fill it with is oh so right.

Early on in the flawed Happythankyoumoreplease, Sam Wexler (Josh Radnor), the center around which the film spins, is informed that the novel he is desperate to get published is “just kind of, well kind of” meh and ironically it is also the most on-point review of the film. “Happythankyoumoreplease” was written and directed by the How I Met Your Mother star, which might explain the lack of real plot and the suspiciously enormous New York City apartments owned by artists with part-time jobs in this indie romantic comedy.

In this case, it is important not to force upon the reader what they are ‘supposed’ to feel, especially if there is a choice they can take for it, unless it is only to be expected. The emphasis here is that of description of the world that a reader is supposed to see. However, I strongly urge against literally creating a blank character that has no feelings or motivations. Should a plot necessitate that the main character should react in a certain manner, do it. If not, a characterless character will strain the plot greatly.
You can buy precut cards that measure 2-1/2 inches by 3-1/2 inches at art and hobby stores. I found canvas and wood ones at Hobby Lobby.

2. Quality of life: The NYC Parks Department did the math a few years ago and concluded that for every dollar they spend on street trees, New Yorkers derive $5.60 worth of benefits. Along with reducing noise, providing shade, and beautifying a street, trees moderate weather, blocking wind and rain and acting as enormous air conditioners in the summer (the USDA equates the daily cooling impact of one healthy young tree with 10 room-sized AC units going full blast for 20 hours). Trees also improve air quality (no surprise there), attract songbirds, and have even been shown to reduce stress with their mere presence.

The row of stores, across the way, have changed a number of times over the years, with the exception of Mountain Made. The store that is The Bridal and Formal Shoppe of Pendleton, it used to be a splendidly random gift shop that carried dishes, dolls, soaps, decorative rocks, and everything else that your heart could desire. And it was always shifting around, so I never knew what to expect in there. Since it changed hands, though, I have some fun memories of my cousins trying on several dresses for a formal outing, and posing in their lovely dressing room.
Late last fall My Baby and I undertook the huge project of rejuvenating a gorgeous, interesting house in a beautiful neighborhood in our nearest-by town. The house had been his part-time bachelor pad/ part time home to four active children for the 20 years before acquiring the house in the country five years ago. In the time that has passed, the house has been lightly lived in and somewhat overlooked. Our early love affair created a bit of a distraction, so the house needed, let's just say, a bit of work. Besides, every house needs a little makeover every 20 years or so, right?
I mentioned above that there were two reasons that it was a thrill to be on at halftime of a Georgia game with Larry Munson. The first is how much I liked him and enjoyed listening to him call games.

I was able to tell him that.

And, those are the 2 pictures I have taken this week.
The first shot after the gravestone is of a snipers gun barrel, the identity of the gunman is hidden by his hair and the low angle of the shot helps to cover his face with the gun, whilst we are seeing this man the music changes to a very uncomfortable odd sound, which helps to set the characterization of this man, making the audience feel uncomfortable, and telling them that this man is not going to be a protagonist. After this the camera changes to a shot through the sniper scope looking at a woman in a swim suit going for a swim, this helps to entice the audience because people are more likely to feel more about a very pretty young woman being killed than a not so good looking middle aged man. This shot also sets the characterization for this woman, we know she is wealthy as she has a pool by a penthouse suite, and a lot of free time to be swimming, we also see her as a victim because we know the sniper is looking at her and she is going to be shot.

Saturday was a work day, but I got to squeeze in some shopping at the flea market - and it was a GOOD day! I bought a desk, a console, a vanity chair, a decorative column, a floor lamp, and a bunch of cool odds and ends. This HUGE vintage Italian mirror was a little mother's day gift to myself. I love the shape and texture. I'm hoping it works over the mantle in our new place.
Then I adjusted my pattern a bit more: bad idea. After the pink and grey pair (bottom of the top picture), things went downhill and I almost threw in the towel. The green circle shoes were made during this dark point of my cobbling. I just couldn't get the proportions of the toe right, and that threw the whole fit off. Finally, I swallowed my pride, looked on the internet, (actually my dad looked for me :)) and found a real pattern. Very similar to my original pattern, it had a couple small changes that I couldn't seem to figure out on my own. I made my own small changes to this final pattern and have it perfected. I still keep trying new things; I put bamboo batting in a pair a couple of days ago to make them thicker. I usually just use lightweight canvas by itself.

HA!” Apparently she found out Abe is now married and having his first kid in a few weeks. They got married for health insurance reasons. She says he’s changed and is looking forward to be a father. BUT then she told me he asked about how I was doing & said he missed me… You have a baby on the way and your married and you’re still asking about a girl who dumped you over 2 years ago? I told Zoe there’s your answer on if he has truly changed…

On Opening Day 1, I demonstrated a technique for making a record of box contents by photographing as you unpack. It was an infinite improvement over trying to describe each item! But, one of the drawbacks is that some items had loose papers inside. No problem as the location of the item can be recorded during the scanning process. But, since archival storage materials were determined during opening day, the unique needs of the inserts were not taken into account.
Fast forward to this morning, Im right back down in it, thanks mom (she always has had the greatest capacity for triggering me, so I dont know why Im surprised). I got up to pee, and saw a note from my mom on the table. I shouldnt have read it when I was planning on going back to sleep but I did. It says, “Toast pick up all poop and sticks in the yard because someone needs to mow the yard before it turns into a jungle, dad needs some help hes too busy”.
In this regard both the ruling coalition and the opposition coalition seem to be equally at fault: Neither side seems prepared to take the bull by the horns and do what seems simply necessary if we still going to entertain the notion that there is some form of nation-building at work in this country.

Cory McAbee’s universe is wonderfully portrayed in the film. McAbee’s use of lighting and shadows gives the otherwise simple sets a sense of depth. He makes us feel as if we are in the 1920s (or watching something from that era) with effective use of makeup on characters like The Boy Who Actually Saw a Women’s Breast, who is shot like a silent film star.

We pass through small towns; they may even be villages, with equally small churches. Towers and spires, arches and stained glass windows. Many of the buildings have rough edges and still bear the marks of simple construction. They lack the ostentatious grandeur of goldfield churches and buildings, but they fit into the landscape. They seem to sit low to the ground, and come from it rather than rest upon it. They seem part rather than placed, a part rather than apart.
How beautiful is that.
Today I had to take my car into Hereford early for an MOT and service - so I took the chance to do some unaccompanied shopping in the morning rather than come home. I was expecting my car to be finished with by about 1 pm, but then found it would take several more hours, but not long enough to make it worth driving home in the courtesy car and then back again. So I went to do more shopping...just for fun and to kill time.

I find it interesting seeing this now, a year after it was recorded, as my answers to Mathieu's (the guy who put together this series) questions, the things I emphasized, would definitely be different were a similar interview to be conducted now. Some of my opinions on unschooling have definitely changed (though nothing specifically mentioned in this video), I no longer really differentiate between unschooling and radical unschooling when I'm talking about it, and similar things... Regardless, I'm pretty happy with what my mum and I had to say (mostly me... Sorry for hogging the interview, mom!).

“Fuck that,” Shushan said. “You’re going to learn you can’t do everything the right way, because of all the people who are ready to do it the wrong way. You’re just a kid, your nose is in books, and maybe you know a lot, but what you don’t know is that in the real world somebody has to make a decision every minute. Okay, sometimes you get the wrong somebody, and sometimes he doesn’t have the luxury of being democratically elected, but somebody has to step up.” (pg 90) Everything a good novel should be and more, THE IRON WILL OF SHOESHINE CATS is by turns hilarious, brutal, irreverent, thought-provoking, vexing and terrific fun. - Declan Burke

Combine the cumin with 2 teaspoons of salt and about ½ teaspoon freshly ground pepper. Season the pork chops well on both sides with this mixture. (You may have some seasoning mix left over.) In a large sauté pan, heat the oil and brown the chops well, 4 to 5 minutes per side, over medium-high heat. Remove chops to a warmed platter. In the same sauté pan, sauté the garlic until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. In a separate bowl, combine the chicken brother, tequila, and lime juice. Remove pan from heat, add liquid, and return to heat. (Have a lid ready to cover the pan in case the alcohol ignites-by combining the liquids, the alcohol has been diluted, but it may flare up). Bring the liquid mixture to a boil and reduce to about ¼ cup. Add the butter and any juices that have accumulated on the platter. Swirl the pan until the butter is incorporated. Season to taste with the minced jalapeno, salt, and pepper. Pour sauce over the chops.
Last post I mentioned school was not going too well for Max so far this year. The year started out fine. The 2 paras that worked with him last year though did not return this year. One of them was hired when Max was in 1st grade, just for Max. She was awesome and the best para. Max loved her. He was a little upset that she was not there on the first day. He got mad at me when I told him he would be with a different para. It is one he knows and works with some. This para was his first para in kindergarten but it just didn't work out!

I think I am genetically programmed to prefer those, but still, I have an open palate, and it was a fun wine to try.

But this isn’t what new age false prophets feed their lemmings. Instead they advise them to get rid of guilt altogether. Guilt is bad. Forgive yourself and move on. They don’t tell their fold, hey, if you’re feeling guilty, start examining that feeling; have you done to another something that you wouldn’t want done to yourself or that you would tolerate another person doing to your child? Or are you feeling guilty because you were mis-raised by an overbearing berating parent who didn’t love you or show you any warmth or tenderness, but who always seemed to criticize you for everything you did, and so you walk around as an adult with this dark “I’m not good enough” cloud hanging over your head that you interpret as “guilt”? These soft-minded false-gurus don’t offer much real insight or much real wisdom, they just dispense their all-or-nothing nonsense; get rid of guilt, stop feeling guilty and you’ll feel better. So what if you did wrong? So what if you cheated on your spouse because you were ungrateful, so what if you broke up the family and moved 2,000 miles away because you were unhappy and bored and wanted to start over and be true to you?

What’s interesting, though, is this doesn’t happen if you just ask someone to imagine something. Especially if you ask them to imagine the outcome of the sale, rather than making the purchase itself. There’s no resistance to that.

Are you a good or bad egg? When I started on my Easter egg pillow craze, these came to my mind. I think they are so fun. They are another reverse applique / faux chenille technique like my Shabby Chic egg pillow. This one has a cleaner edge in case you are not a fan of the free motion sketch motif of the other one.

LinkedIn is a mainstream business application with several important capabilities. First, it is a large database of business professionals with 90 million members as of January, 2011. Each user has a record that contains (1) biographical information (called a profile), (2) a list of business associates also on LinkedIn, and (3) contact information. Second, it is a social network. A social network brings together people who have relationships, and who potentially could have relationships. This is accomplished in large part through the key word search function. Third, LinkedIn provides convenient channels of communication, allowing its members to interact and share. This is accomplished by (1) the feature of sending e-mails through LinkedIn to members of your network, and (2) discussion groups organized around specialized topics.
I think I must be terribly romantic. I love Jane Austen's weaving love stories from the 1700's. I could read Pride and Prejudice over and over, and probably never tire of reading about the love story between Elizabeth and Darcy.

I’m going to be honest, even if it’s a bit fangirl-ish: content-wise, I loved Cataclysm. My introduction to World of Warcraft lore took place in three parts, or more correctly, one story in the parts: War of the Ancients. Knowing that I would get to team up with and face off against the characters and dragons I’d read about put me on the edge of my seat for the expansion.
Wow, leave it to a guy to tell a gross story like that on a date. Or could it be called a date? The writer does have a boyfriend. What do you think, dear reader? Were her intentions good? Should she have gone and met this boy in the park? I think we’ve all seen what the romantic atmosphere of a park can lead to based on Valerie’s diary entry above. Her innocent kiss led her right into Vince’s bed.

After a while I realized it was an odd sound that occurred each morning at precisely 4:20am that was spring-boarding me into yet another new day. The noise was so very foreign that I couldn’t actually peg it. Was it a bird? Was it a plane? Was it that woman next door having particularly loud sex again?

Caesars is very opulent. This is where Mesa Grill and the delicious buffet with all the desserts are.

Essentially, officials want Congress to require all services that enable communications — including encrypted e-mail transmitters such as BlackBerry, social networking websites such as Facebook and software that allows direct “peer-to-peer” messaging such as Skype — to be technically capable of complying if served with a wiretap order. The mandate would include being able to intercept and unscramble encrypted messages.

Now, I say this like it happens a lot. Like I just sit around on beds until Grant comes home. ha ha ha HA. Not really. That's just not how life works, no matter how many kids you do or don't have. But every once in a great while, an opportunity pops up for a teeny retreat. Just a moment or two of quiet. To sigh, close my eyes, pray, be in a different room of my home. Do you ever retreat at your house? Let me encourage you to make your bed and go sit on it!
Sigur Rós, let me be honest with you: I had barely heard of them. But that is where it becomes fun to be confronted by a young redactional team. From time to time they have persuasive arguments to change even the mind of a somewhat elderly chief-editor. Such as: Sigur Rós was top of the bill at Werchter and Pukkelpop. and moreover: de Morgen Magazine is the only one, worldwide, to do an interview with the musical sensation of 2008. And if that wasn't enough persuasive force: Belgian photographer Eva Vermandel made a photoalbum about this band. Sometimes even the most obtuse chief-editor can be moved by such arguments. So, we want to know. who are these people out of bankrupt Iceland that can inspire the young folks in Flanders so much that they even achieve the top while singing in a non-existing language? Further more there is the remarkable role played by Flemish photographer Eva Vermandel in the Sigur Rós saga. She made a remarkable photoalbum about the band which was added to the luxurious edition of the latest album by the band. When she was 22 she left for London in the hope of building up a career as photographer there. aAtask she managed quite well. Without much glamourous tricks she made photographs for the Observer, the Independent magazine and worked for the Wire and British Vogue. that deserves some respect. As much respect goes to Sigur Rós, the counterpoint to the adage which tells us that the media is all-defining. Sigur Rós never needed the media, they even didn't want anything to do with it. Thus they haven't done any interviews this year, with the exception for one in the British magazine Q. How then did Bart Steenhaut managed to get to them? Shall we ever get an answer to it? Two years ago there was an appointment, but then front-man Jónsi left without honouring it. Now however it worked. Flemish Eva Vermandel probably provided a link. Because things work out between Vermandel and the Icelandic sensation. "I thought what she does is real art. not too styled, not too cool" we are told. Maybe the most interesting question of them all was asked at the end of the interview, especially so after the impressive performance Sigur Rós pulled off at Vorst Nationaal. With what sort of feeling do you hope the crowd leaves after a Sigur Rós concert Bart Steenhaut wanted to know. "I hope they are happy and satisfied. but above all I hope our music inspires. Sometimes i am amazed when i see the part our music plays in the lives of others."

The 1934-36 Batter-Up set, issued by National Chicle, contains 192 blank-backed die-cut cards. Numbers 1 to 80 are approximately 2 3/8" by 3 1/4" in size while 81 to 192 are 2 3/8" by 3". The latter are more difficult to find than the former. The pictures come in basic black and white or in tints of blue, brown, green, purple, red, or sepia. There are three combination cards (each featuring two players per card) in the high series (98, 111, and 115). Cards with the die-cut backing removed are graded fair at best.

Brunch, an amalgamation of breakfast and lunch. One of the more popular meals often found on a weekend by those who have slept in past breakfast but are hungry before the lunch period. Today I find myself at Danks Street Depot on a Saturday morning enjoying brunch with a couple friends – what a better way to kick start the weekend!
Same roasted grain taste and a decent bitter pop. It's indistinct, with any particular characteristics drowned out by the roasted flavor. It still has that hint of sweetness too, and it still seems a bit like a milk stout.
But it was late at night already and didn't have time to bake a whole new cake, so instead I just cut out the main part of Hello Kitty's face with the majority of the cake, and then with the scraps I cut out the shape of the ears and bow. Then I fit them into the mold, hoping the mousse that would go on top would end up holding the cake in place.

Tricky, but I think it has to be all those tales connected with the Slavic witch Baba Yaga. ‘Baba’ means granny or old woman in many Slavic languages, and she’s very much an archetypal crone figure, sharing characteristics with the likes of Hecate and The Fates of classical mythology. Bony, long-toothed, and wild-haired, Baba Yaga scales the skies in a pestle-propelled mortar, and lives in a log cottage that’s raised from the ground by a pair of chicken legs and surrounded by a skull-topped fence. Some believe her origins reach back as far as Paleolithic times, when she was a patroness/goddess of huntsmen, horsemen and agriculture. She’s most known as a destructive force, but her reach is all encompassing: she’s both Destroyer and Creator. She controls time and nature, the rising and setting of the sun and the cycle of the moon. Life and death – human, animal and plant - is in her command. She’s also Mistress of the Underworld: her hearth is said to be the threshold to the world of the dead. In some stories more weight is given to her all-knowing capacity. Interestingly, the Russian word for witch, ved’ma, derives from the word to know, ved’. One of my favourite Baba Yaga stories is ‘Vasilisa the Beautiful’ in which a girl, guided by her magical wooden doll, successfully completes a series of tasks set by Baba Yaga and is freed from her bullying stepfamily.

Yes, I'm intentionally not calling them resolutions. I don't know why. Perhaps it seems trite, and yet, here I am posting a list on my blog, which is just as expected and hackneyed. But somehow I like the idea of setting goals as opposed to making resolutions, though I do like this particular definition: A course of action determined or decided on.

Because like any big family we fight a lot, sometimes in public. We have opinions and we really, really care about them, sometimes so much that we don’t treat each other as well as we should. We have “old-fashioned” beliefs that are out of mainstream. We are called to welcome the alien, care for the vulnerable, commit ourselves to prayer, use our sexuality appropriately, forgive the sinner, and respect the dignity of every human being. Every. Single. One.

5. Finally, even if you concede the rest of the argument, Habermas’s conclusion requires you to assess the probability of whatever ad hoc theory you concoct at argument #4 and weigh it against the probability that the resurrection actually occurred. This is conceptually impossible, and not simply for the reasons given by David Hume. Any comparative analysis requires you to assign some nonzero value to Pr(R|B), which is the probability of the resurrection given our background knowledge. If Pr(R|B) is zero, then Pr(R|B&E) — the probability of the resurrection given our background knowledge and some new evidence E — is also zero via Bayes’ theorem.

This is your brain opening doors and showing you possibilities. Glimpses of what could be. They're telling you your characters *could* be these kinds of people, or your world might be like this. They're inviting you to think long and hard, make choices, sink into the mind of the people whose story you need to tell, to immerse yourself in their world. They're inviting you to walk through as many of those doors as you like, have a curious wander around, then either move in or walk away and close the door behind you.

And it was a little nerve-wracking and fun talking with Tyler during the process, who when I first told him I was going to send the script out to some contacts, expected to field 3 calls, maybe 4 tops. He didn’t expect to be on the phone for 8 straight hours two days in a row. He didn’t expect to have to turn down calls from producers who just days ago he would’ve sold his left arm to talk to. It was insane.
There are some 3,000 Christians in Gaza amid a population of some 1.5 million Muslims. They mostly have good relations. But some Gaza Christians have reported harassment by religious hardliners since the terrorist Islamic group Hamas seized power in 2007.
I have the same problem with my new Western Mysteries series, set in Virginia City, Nevada Territory, in 1862. To me it is deeply thrilling. I have the Civil War, Indian battles, the Salting of Silver Mines, Runaway Slaves, Mark Twain & other priceless primary sources. Plus Virginia City is still there and chock full of museums, mine shafts, lively saloons (!) and historical re-enactors. But it's still going to be a hard sell to children aged 9+ in the UK. To them this time and place is deeply unsexy. Their grandfathers liked Western movies for heaven's sake. How uncool is that?
Although the White House is saying this trip was not political, it’s handy that the president’s address was on the anniversary of Osama bin Laden’s death. Obama can now say he ended one war (Iraq) and has started to end another.

Nicolas though that he was glad with not having a hurried morning schedule, he thought that he preferred a shadowy existence paralleled to that of everybody else. And he thought that his runs every morning brought him a great deal of joy in a world where joy took very little part. He thought that being the best in what he was without fail brought him a little sense of justice, a way of revenge, since he didn’t choose to do what he did.

The ‘pain and terror’ soundscape was created often in both TOO and Dark Star on the tour, but here it seems to echo the events of 1937 and the pain and terror captured by Picasso. What makes this (fortuitously) remarkable is the musical figure that Weir starts up (on the right) about three minutes in. He’s trying to guide the band into what is commonly termed the ‘Spanish Jam’. I can’t recall if that happens on any other night but I’m fairly sure it doesn’t combine with the warzone theme.

Dried fruit platters, nut platters, rugelach tins, mandelbroit, chocolate arrays, bagels packages seem to be the natural way to go. People need comfort food at a time like this if they choose to eat at all.
Traveling Vegan can be tough when you are visiting new places. One thing to keep in mind is that all restaurants have vegetables. So even a baked potato dry can work. Not as exciting as some dishes though. You can always ask for an all veggie salad too without the extra non-vegan items they throw on it. Steamed veggies go great on top of a dry potato too.

At school, I learned about the ancient civilisations of Egypt, India, Rome and Greece, but Sub-Saharan Africa wasn’t mentioned. And so outside of school, I became more fervent in my curiosity: learning about Colonialism, Slavery in America, Apartheid, Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu from my mother, the media, literature and the internet. I read Uncle Tom’s Cabin, Long Walk to Freedom, anything I could get my hands on and news articles about African countries were always the first to get my interest.

We have been watching Andrews head since he jumped from 60% to 95% and has been climbing from there. We do have an extra cautious Dr. (which I prefer), and doesn't help that John has had a shunt since close after birth, but we have put off the CT until now. His head is off the chart and his fontanel is nearly closed. We were feeling pretty good about it, but wanted to make sure. A quick test, and all is NORMAL! Drew was amazing for it all. Charmed everyone in the waiting room, quickly made friends with those helping with the CT, zoomed through the scan no problems, and got a new ball, sucker, and a sippy cup of milk out of the deal.
