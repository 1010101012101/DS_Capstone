Thankfully, as a counterpoint, one of the film's great attributes is Emily Blunt as Violet, the aspiring scholar proposed to by Tom (Segel), a San Francisco chef. Blunt adds a genuineness and grace that helps smooth out some of "The Five-Year Engagement's" more problematic edges.

In 2008, 66 percent of young voters cast their ballot for Obama; today, there's a chance those numbers may have dwindled. According to a report released last week by the Public Religion Research Institute and Georgetown University's Berkley Center, 61 percent of college-age millennials — those aged 18-24 — are registered to vote, but only 46 percent say they are absolutely certain whom they'll vote for this November.

At that time I was a saucer-eyed brat working in an (also now defunct) East Village guitar shop, in order to be a part of that live-music scene and to keep my ear to the ground. Regular clientele at the shop included Iggy Pop, Frank Black, Mark Ribot, Robert 'Bob' Quine, Robert Poss, Ned Hayden, Jon Spencer, Paige Hamilton, Joan Jett, and Billy Gibbons, as well as guitarist-producers like Eric Ambel, Nite Bob, and Danny Blume. In addition, there were the locals in up and comings, including a heavyset character named Tom Price, whose presence immediately outshone whomever else happened to be around, celebrity or no. Staff and customers would wait for his arrival and hang on his every word. Those words were loud, hilarious, quick, sharp as a knife, genuine, and brutally honest. Also, he would buy virtually every cheap guitar that came through the shop for the purpose of smashing onstage.
As to the rest, though, the Ohio General Assembly needs to do as it did with vouchers and mayoral control: Grant Cleveland an exception and let it experiment.

So is long term care insurance a waste of money, especially at these new higher premiums? I certainly hope that you live a long, healthy,� and independent life, with a quick painless ending. But one thing is a sure bet: We will all die someday. And in between now and then, we want the best of care. And that's The Savage Truth.

This is not to complain about the show. It's a wonderful show — funny, inventive, madcap, full of energy and good music and, in its way, subversive. Does one dare compare the Monkees to the Marx Brothers? At the least, they share the Marxes' penchant for mayhem and thumbing their noses at authority.

That's more than a half of a billion in guaranteed contracts for his clients since the start of December. To offer further perspective, those four Lozano clients are one investor shy of being able to buy the Houston Astros (purchase price: $615 million) if that investor was, say, shortstop Jose Reyes, whose six-year, $106-million deal with Miami would give the group roughly $15 million more than the purchase price to, I dunno, fund a sculpture or two for a new ballpark.

There's a better way. Let's go back to the drawing boards. Let's get environmentalists, experts and the public at the table and start going solar quickly and methodically just as utilities all over the world are doing. Let's have a plan to use our money wisely and generate the electricity we need to start closing those dirty power plants we own and start cleaning our dirty air.
"For me the joy of writing is the fiction," Hauser said. "I say I never let the truth get in the way of a good story. I use the basic known facts to hang the story on, but everything else, what makes a person go from point A to point B, the relationships, the motivations, the fears, I like to fill in with my own imagination."

The challenge for Tucker is to produce interesting combinations without the use of animal by-products such as milk and eggs. The backbone of California cuisine is to preserve the integrity of the flavors, yet at Millennium that concept is pushed to the edge. By the end of the meal, we felt as if our palates had been bombarded, and many dishes ended up tasting monotonous.

I said and wrote last winter that Ventura would be inclined to stick with Beckham as long as possible, based partly on Robin's 0-for-41 slump in 1990 as a 23-year-old. But Robin was a rookie and rebounded, and Gordon is 25 and starting his third full season.

The cheerleading camp's director is Coach Keith (hilariously campy John Michael Higgins, a stalwart of the Christopher Guest acting ensemble and now Molly Shannon's squeeze on TV's "Kath & Kim"). Coach's welcome is an inappropriate cheer, though that's about as coarse as language gets. Even the gay jokes and references (to male and female alike) are kept to a minimum.

"In that case, you had extra fatty tissue, and now you just have extra skin," Medalie says. "But some men have had this since they were 16 or so, and it's not related to skin and fat. That is true gynecomastia, which means breast development, not just of skin and fat, but of glandular tissue."
"The thievery, the double-dipping, it became an industry," he said.
Tony Colombraro, a resident on Lakeside Drive West, which parallels Lewis Lane, said he saw where a 4-foot-high swath of "slushy" light-brown mud had swept cross the road near his house and into nearby Mountain Lake.

The answers depend on which side of the deal you're on - the borrower, or the lender - or just a homeowner who is struggling, but managing to pay the mortgage, only to watch others demand - and get - a better deal.
Consider Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel, whose late-’90s albums “On Avery Island” and “In the Aeroplane Over the Sea” continue to exert influence over contemporary folk-pop singer-songwriters. Mangum has been reclusive since the breakup of Neutral Milk Hotel, but ATP coaxed him out of semi-retirement; he curated Friday’s bill and reprised his Friday performance at a Sunday matinee. So passionate is his audience that he could have spent his hourlong set doing anything — covers, new material, acid-folk excursions into the ether. Instead, he gave the people what they wanted: stripped-down and straightforward readings of songs from “Avery” and “Aeroplane.” He even encouraged the crowd to sing and clap along as if this were a Harry Chapin show.
With no formal training  Paula Meadows didn't even graduate from high school, she said  they invested their retirement savings as down payment on the property on Highway 99.

"Every interventional cardiologist is going to be afraid that some angry patient or angry attorney or disgruntled colleague or competitor is going to turn him in for doing unnecessary procedures," said Dr. William O'Neill, executive dean of clinical affairs at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine. He was hired by Midei's attorneys to review some of the Towson cardiologist's case files and says he found no unwarranted stents.
The Flyers (2-1) probably deserved a better fate. They controlled play through the first half and had the majority of the match's scoring chances.
Of course, the curious dismissals of Pritchard and Cho -- and the fact that Allen has employed four GMs in the last eight years -- offer cause for concern. Kerr says any potential candidate almost certainly will ask for specific details about Cho's firing, among a host of other things, when going through the interview process.
That would raise costs for U.S. companies operating overseas, making them less competitive. Instead, the United States should move toward a "territorial" tax system, business groups argue. Tax would apply only to income earned within the United States.
Safety board Chairwoman Deborah Hersman, who visited the blast site Wednesday and talked to people who lost their homes in the disaster and relatives of the victims, said the reporting delay had damaged PG&E's credibility with the government.

Hatcher, who had always loved the home, was immediately on board.
But Brokaw's love letter made the restoration work seem urgent, and suggested that the building was not realizing its full potential in terms of winning a place in the hearts of next generations. Lots of visitors still enter it every year. If they could hear and see a version of what Saturday night's visitors got - an abbreviated history show, perhaps a film with lighting timed to reveal the architecture - the Academy would be making the same kind of emotional connections that so impressed Philadelphians who still speak powerfully about having heard one of Stokowski's children's concerts there decades ago.

I'm on the island of Lantau, Hong Kong's largest, staring up at a giant Buddha.
We dominate a vacuum of power. The Air Force's only rival in the air is the U.S. Navy, owner of the world's second-largest air force. On the seas, the Navy is unrivaled but continues to add ships to the fleet. In this vacuum, members of Congress challenge each service to outspend each other, far beyond what is feasible for true national security. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta noted, "you've also got to take into consideration the national security threat that comes from the huge deficits and the huge debt that we're running." We cannot afford to avoid tough decisions when it comes to our budget. We certainly can't afford to give each branch of the military a blank check for weapons systems we don't need.

How much will it cost to hire someone?
A single United Airlines 737 passenger jet suffered at least 29 minor collisions with birds and one accident involving a small deer -- more than any other plane since 2000. In only one case was damage significant, when the jet climbed out of Philadelphia International Airport into a flock of gulls flying at 1,000 feet the night of Jan. 30, 2006. The pilot declared an emergency after at least one engine sucked in a large gull and began vibrating badly. No one was hurt, but the airline spent about $37,000 in repairs.
Matt Knight Arena filled up with 10,830 fans Saturday afternoon, many of them there to honor the football team’s Rose Bowl win over Wisconsin. But that crowd got a good show the second half, as the Ducks fought back, taking their first lead on a Singler putback with 7:47 to play. With that bucket, Oregon led 52-50. They wouldn’t trail the rest of the way.

After the district told the board that portables may be necessary at River Grove Elementary to help accommodate additional transferring students and growth in those boundaries, a number of parents challenged the decision. Instead of adding portables, they argued, why not reopen Palisades Elementary School?
"The governor’s quote as we know it, ‘the best defense is a good offense,’ is coming out front and center here," said Assembly Majority Leader Joe Cryan (D-Union), one of Christie’s most ardent critics. "He can propose what he wants. But he is just trying to point to another shiny object. He can’t pull the wool over people’s eyes."
Vereen failed to recognize the Secret Service as the ultimate authority during the Florida Democratic Convention, "when he disregarded their orders to remain out of areas, which were secured for the protection of the Vice President of the United States."
“Government at all levels needs to make human trafficking a priority. The victims of modern-day slavery live within our borders and need our help. Despite the tremendous cost to the public and the impact on victims of this crime, trafficking is frequently a low priority law enforcement issue.

Instead of letting their fingers do the walking, more and more consumers are turning to the Internet, cell phones and iPads to find local restaurants, plumbers, dentists and other businesses. So much so that in the last five years, the number of phone book copies has dropped from 600 million to 425 million, industry reports say.
Of course, homeowners don't need to transform their yards all at once. Adding edibles to the landscape can be a relatively simple and inexpensive process, and one that can grow over time.
The trend that has sucked away middle-class jobs in America has, ironically, fostered the growth of middle-class lifestyles in China, Brazil, India and other emerging economies. Demand for goods on other continents has begun to outstrip demand in the U.S. and Western Europe.

Robert Griffin III told the Colts (and other teams) he isn't going to go through personal workouts. In the Colts' case, it's more proof he's smart. First, he'd rather be in Washington, where Dan Snyder is likely to open negotiations on a contract extension after his first touchdown pass.
Grasu (6-foot-3, 278 pounds) has some size on Armstrong (6-2, 260), but neither is as physical as Holmes was. Armstrong has the extra year of experience, a year of studying the playbook and of Greatwood continually chatting him up and clearing his head.

Stats coming off bench: Young averaged 12.7 points per game and 5.3 rebounds, playing 26 minutes per game. Under Doug Collins, Young changed his approach, getting closer to the basket and it paid off with 54 percent shooting. After attempting 138 and 164 3-point shots (and hitting at a 34 percent clip) the previous two seasons, he tried only 22 from downtown last season. Not surprisingly, his rebounding numbers also soared.

Charles Ponzi had none of these advantages so that analogy is weak. It is not the case that "such a scheme could only continue if the working-age population grew more rapidly than the number of retirees." Social Security is a tax on those who are working which benefits those who no longer can, and can be adjusted to meet their needs. I can understand a reluctance to pay more taxes, but the intellectual dishonesty in claiming that Social Security is "insolvent" places a belief that "most Americans are already overtaxed" over intellectual honesty.

The familiar saying, "As American as apple pie," didn't gain its place in our language without some basis in fact.

Fox initially ordered 13 episodes of "Glee." With its offbeat mix of comedy, drama and musical numbers, nobody knew if the show would find an audience. It did. The Sept. 9 season premiere was watched by 7.3 million viewers, the highest original series premiere in three years for Fox. The solid ratings inspired the network to order a full season. But that means there's a gap as producers make more. After its Dec. 9 episode, "Glee" went on hiatus and returns April 13, 2010 -- giving latecomers a chance to watch the first part of the season online (on iTunes or free at www.hulu.com) or on DVD ("Glee, Season 1, Volume 1: Road to Sectionals" will be released Dec. 29).

Mostly he showed decay, though that managed to make Wichita Lineman' seem a song about holding on to life by the barest of margins and made Rhinestone Cowboy' almost defiant.

That led to a wholesale change in the ocean's dominant animals within just 200,000 years, or perhaps much less, Clapham said. Among the hardest hit were corals; many types, including the horn-shaped bottom-dwellers known as rugose corals, disappeared altogether. Sea sponges were also devastated, along with the shelled creatures that commanded the Permian reefs and sea. Every single species of the once common trilobites, with their helmetlike front shells, vanished for good.

The mix of WWII style and flashy modern eye candy is no surprise, coming from director Joe Johnston. The former effects guy directed the retro cult fave "The Rocketeer" and has also helmed modern big-ticket movies like "Jumanji." He's comfortable in both worlds.
He is a Hall of Famer who had a spectacular career before he ever got to St. Louis. Left unprotected by the Chicago Blackhawks, he came here in the expansion draft in 1967 and was a big reason the team made it to the Stanley Cup Finals in its first three seasons.

"The shame is we let this game get away in the first inning," said Giants manager Bruce Bochy. "The damage was done."
Bernanke said that it was fortunate that Congress had decided to preserve the Fed's regulatory connection to small banks. In one version of the measure, the Fed would have lost the power to regulate them. But the law maintains the Fed's powers and even broadened it to include thrift holding companies. The thrifts themselves will be regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Congress abolished the Office of Thrift Supervision, which was a weak regulator.
"We all know we're relevant," Feldman said. "I mean, we have 85,000 objects made by and for humans. Our job is to communicate how and why they're relevant to a 21st century visitor."

Everything changed before anybody could blink.
The more recent era of Mortimer's and Swifty's, patterned a bit on the informal old P.J. Clarke's, was ushered in. Many of the old established cafes fell by the wayside. Colacello notes that of the originals, only La Grenouille and Le Cirque are left. Swifty's is really going strong. (One of its owners is Robert Caravaggi, the son of an earlier owner of Quo Vadis!)

Among his reasons for opposing Gingrich’s candidacy, Savage cited the former House speaker’s work as a paid consultant for Freddie Mac, and his marital history.
Why European bats have not died off en masse is unknown. It's possible they developed immunity to the fungus or learned to avoid places that favor the spread of the disease.

Several ideas were brought to the table, said those in the meeting, chief among them regionalizing police services.
You might start with an investment of $100,000 that would otherwise sit in a bank money-market account. Put it into a life insurance policy earning a guaranteed minimum of 3.5 percent - and that gives you at least twice your deposit in death benefits, and 6 times or more that in long-term care benefits. You can withdraw the cash if you purchase a rider that returns your premium.
Koschman's beating surfaced in news reports after Vanecko appeared in a police lineup on May 20, 2004. At the time, police said Vanecko was involved in Koschman's death but never explained how.
“We need the residents to help us,” Medany said.
I would like to comment on the op-ed column “Hiking taxes on the wealthy shrinks overall tax revenue” (Sept. 19) by Michael Busler. Professor Busler’s theory is that raising taxes on the wealthy will reduce, not increase, tax revenue. Less tax on the wealthy gives them more capital to invest in corporations, so they will then have more money to create jobs.
The Brics nations held their first annual summit three years ago in Russia amid the onset of the global financial crisis. The group, which accounts for 40% of the world's population and a fifth of the global economy, set out to remodel the world's financial architecture amid rising anger over Western dominance of the system at a time of financial meltdown.
SACRAMENTO – Some Oakland residents are furious that on the same day a gunman murdered seven people this week at the private Oikos University in the city, SWAT teams raided a different educational institution less than a mile away, where only peaceful activities were being conducted.
Portland has embraced this smaller field and turned it into an impregnable (so far) fortress.

Oliver also argued that the legislation was more fair than Gov. Chris Christie's initial proposal that would force public employees to pay 30 percent of the cost of the premium. The compromise takes into account the employees salary, she said.
Imo buys most of the soybean oil he uses from ADM. He also uses a tiny amount of recycled vegetable oil from his family's pizza chain and other St. Louis area restaurants. He collects the used oil through an agreement with the Rev. Larry Rice, who collects it and filters it. Imo pays Rice for the oil, with proceeds to help combat homelessness.
Santana pitched. He struck out five, allowed two hits and two walks, and tried to push his luck by talking his way into a sixth inning that Collins, smartly, was never going to agree to. Santana took a no-decision, the Mets finally scratching a run off Tommy Hanson in the sixth and winning 1-0 and improving their Opening Day record to a remarkable 33-18. But make no mistake: This felt like the Mets’ biggest win since Game 161 of 2008, Santana throwing zeroes at the Marlins and keeping that season alive an extra day.
In its first phase of expansion, Under Armour plans a four-story building to house offices and a 20,000-square-foot flagship store. The company hopes to begin construction next year and complete it in 2013.
He essentially was squeezed out of a spot when the Tigers signed Prince Fielder and moved Miguel Cabrera to third base. Inge had been playing some second base, but Ryan Raburn and Ramon Santiago got more time there. Inge said he has no hard feelings whatsoever about the Tigers - he gave all the higher-ups hugs when he left - and he said he had been just days away from requesting his release.

Washington: Left-hander John Lannan was sent to Triple-A Syracuse, and left-hander Ross Detwiler was transferred from the bullpen to the rotation. Lannan twice has started Opening Day and appeared to have a spot in the rotation locked up after Chien-Ming Wang was injured in spring training.
How did I do it? Through a simple technique called division. Basically, you chop off a piece of a perennial plant—or pull apart a chunk of its roots by hand, depending on the variety—put it in the ground and let it grow into a new one. In a year or two, the babies should grow almost to the size of the parent.

The portrait of bin Laden's life in the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, emerges from a sheaf of letters released Thursday that provide a sort of anthropology of a terror network. The frustrations expressed by bin Laden as he issued instructions sometimes in vain might be familiar to any chief executive trying to keep tabs on a multinational corporation that had grown beyond its modest origins.
Medina exemplifies the kind of transformation possible for people in heavily affected groups, who are up against genetic and cultural forces that propel them toward diabetes.

Having only four entrees simplifies things, and some of them reappear. Black cod is almost invariably an elegant, melting fish, but this version is dazzling. It nails the fish's texture, backing it with a texture setup of squash, brussels sprouts and bacon, a vegetable hash at a whole different level. It can stand up to the oxtail, or to a lushly moist rabbit hindquarter.
Benfield said the original contract called for a a limited time period of due diligence that would have allowed his company to conduct building inspections, discuss the building's capacity needs with vendors, and an appraisal by their bank. That process took them beyond the allotted time frame in the contract.
The E Street Truffle is quite a risky name in New Jersey. You wouldn’t want to offend those who revere the poetry of Bruce. Yet this dessert, with its rich chocolate gelato and dense, mousselike cake as sweet and irresistible as, say, Rosalita (sorry for that, it was too tempting), plus its fresh homemade whipped cream and strawberry garnish, manages to justify its name.
"It's put up or shut up time now," Christie said. "They have yet to put out a specific proposal for pension reform. The clock is ticking."
Uncover, cool until you can handle the wings, and then transfer them to a rimmed baking sheet. If desired, remove bone from the drumettes while they are still quite warm. However, wait until the mid wings cool a bit more - if they are too hot, they will shred; if too cold, they will hard to de-bone. Rotate each bone and slide out of the wings. Cool completely, then place flat, using parchment between layers. Finish recipe or refrigerate if making ahead.

MPR also has an interest in developing new audiences, for both itself and the art form, Roesler said: "There's a growing awareness that classical-loving kids are being underserved, if not ignored.

It would be dumb for the state to take guns away from the police, but the truth is, law abiding citizens need firearms for the same reason cops do. People are being mugged and shot in Chevy Chase as well as Baltimore City, and residents there have as much right to keep and bear arms for defense as any cop on the beat.
"I understand there has to be security. It’s in the law and regulations and the Attorney General has a role to play here in terms of background checks,’’ Scotti said.

It's the same old case of management taking care of its friends. Let a few of these ‘quality' managers quit over the issue of not getting raises; find out what the threshold of pain really is. Then advertise for the vacated jobs and step back so you won't be buried in the avalanche of applications. I'll bet dollars to doughnuts you'll find some extremely qualified, more experienced people. Maybe they can't run a sobriety check point yet, but that's trainable.

I was about twenty feet away from the beaver on the shore! I am standing taking photos of the two beavers swimming and suddenly the beaver returned and climbed back onshore into the brush while I am still standing there! Let the fun begin, I am trying to keep still and quiet, the wind is blowing my plastic lens cover into the camera making a noise, my ski pole, wrapped around my wrist, is blowing in the wind and I am trying to get a clear photo of this animal through a lot of reeds. To add to this scene, the other poor beaver is swimming back and forth slapping his tail in the water and diving, trying to warn his friend that I am standing there.
The land is owned by the Boy Scouts and is part of the Mataguay Scout Reservation. Fred Baldwin and Lillian Guidry have refused to discuss with the Scouts an option which would permit them to live out their days where they are. Unfortunately Lillian's son Clint, who prefers to go by his nickname "Caveman," has threatened employees and volunteers working for the Mataguay Scout Ranch. He has blocked the Scouts' road on Scouts property. Annually tens of thousands of youth from schools, churches, officer training corps and multiple other youth-serving organizations use Mataguay Scout Ranch to camp and learn outdoor skills. The Scouts take seriously their obligation to protect the safety and well-being of these youth as well as volunteers and staff. Clint has continued to pose a threat and as such has not and will not be included in any offer to remain living on Scouts property.

Typically, we avoid the college games like anthrax, and the few games we’ve watched in this tourney made us feel soiled: We saw South Florida, a team that ain’t pretty in the best of times, miss 22 straight shots against Temple and still win in a rout. We saw Florida State’s senior point guard implode in the final minute, spitting out turnovers every which way, and blowing a game he should have locked up against Cincinnati.

KENT, Ohio -- It could not have been a more dreary Monday morning. A hard, cold rain turned melting snow into gray slush all around Ryan Anderson's home, so he was extra careful as he climbed into his red sport utility vehicle.

This tension exists for audiences, too, by the way. We want local actors to hit the big time and become celebrities.

His manner, his style, his elegance ... if I could aspire to emulate anyone, it would be him. For me to be able to observe him and watch how he works a room. ... There is just no other like him.

He emphasized the need to increase diversity within the Police Department and talked of innovative programs that have been launched to address domestic violence and youth crime.
The mother-daughter team learned there is stiff competition for store shelf-space. They first persuaded small health food stores to carry 1-2-3 Gluten Free and worked their way up to larger, nationwide operations. A big break came when the wife of a Kroger executive tasted the product and told her husband. Ullner's products are now in some Kroger stores. Locally, Acme markets, Mustard Seed Market and Cafe, Nature's Bin in Lakewood, the Raisin Rack in Canton and some Heinen's stores sell 1-2-3 Gluten Free mixes.

I totally agree with letter-writer Freda Garelick's statement that divorce or separation can have devastating effects on the children of heterosexual marriages ("Even if you don't approve of gay marriage, don't denigrate gay parents," Feb. 9). While I have no statistical information on the frequency of "divorce or separation" of same-sex partners, I'm sure they do occur, resulting in similar impacts on the children of such unions.

This year, when you are writing your check, remember that Colorado is a low-tax state. Colorado's combined state and local taxes rank 44th lowest out of the 50 states per $1,000 of income. And while some people feel their taxes are too high, the fact is that Coloradans pay less in state taxes than a majority of their fellow Americans. While this means less money out of our pockets come Tax Day, it also equates to a smaller investment in the things that make our communities thrive.

Two years ago against Tennessee, foul trouble for David Lighty helped doom the Buckeyes in a Sweet 16 loss. In this game, a questionable second foul call by the officials limited Sullinger to six minutes and four points in the first half, but the Buckeyes managed a halftime tie at 29 thanks in large part to the contributions of freshman big man Amir Williams (three points, four rebounds, two blocks). That first 20 minutes had to be viewed as a victory.
The result is that the whole grid gets by with less power needed to be generated — a very green alternative to the other backup option, which is often an older plant called a "peaker."
My kids are obsessed with animals. We have three at our house: a cat who thinks he's a dog, a cat who thinks she's a god and a rabbit, Capt. Jack Remmington, III, Esq, the world's only rabbit/pirate/lawyer. That isn't enough; we have stuffed animals and we watch videos about animals and since they've discovered YouTube, we watch animals bloopers until I want to throw up (because it's the internet and of course I watch it with them. I've seen the news and I know internet predators can now reach through the monitor and take your children right off the couch. You can't fool me). And now they've found something even better: our neighbor has Fish TV.

Naqib, who lives in Westlake, grew up near Jerusalem, and came to the United States in 1989. He started his grocery business like a lot of others, with little space and little food, when he bought an existing store in 2005.

Sher’s Kafka-inspired production, with sets by Michael Yeargan, costumes by Catherine Zuber and lighting by James F. Ingalls, combined the dark, nightmarish forces persecuting the title character with the rich color of his imagination.

The variety's quality and reputation have been superb, but this has not translated into profits for Jones and Lin, much to their disappointment. Lin, the more experienced of the two in horticulture, is 72 and has been unable to supervise the planting as he originally envisioned. The production of their grove, which appears to be infected with a severe strain of citrus tristeza virus, is low, 3 tons per acre at best. That's a third of the average for mandarins in California, where acreage has soared from 4,000 to 40,000 since the orchard was planted. New groves of the Gold Nugget variety, which competes in the same season, have knocked down the wholesale price of Temecula Sweet in recent years. Commercial growers and shippers take one look at the fruit's puffy appearance, which indicates that it is too fragile to go over a packing line, and say, "Get that thing away from me!"

The party is hosted by "The Makeover Guy" Christopher Hopkins and fashion maven Laura Schara (they'll be working the pink carpet entrance, too, so dress appropriately). Both the main level and the rooftop will be decked out for dancing and a fashion show featuring looks by six Twin Cities designers. General admission tickets are $125. "VIPink" tickets are sold out, but if you're willing to go one step up, there are still $500 special VIPink tickets, which get you limo service and one night in a swanky downtown hotel ($750 for a couple).

"NASA ignored the intent of Congress and the interests of taxpayers," Brown said in a press statement. "NASA was directed to consider regional diversity when determining shuttle locations.

In a nutshell: Given the success of the hit TV series "Mad Men," it's a wonder that it's taken this long for a retro cookbook celebrating 1960s cookery to come out. This collection of 100 recipes has the sort of dips, Jell-O salads and fondues that evoke the era of mini skirts and Motown hits -- plus, of course, cocktails. The cookbook's design features the avocado and sunflower hues that dominated kitchen decor then, with typography that looks like it could have come from a Don Draper-led ad campaign.

Venture north of San Pedro and boom -- you're out of blue-collar territory and onto the genteel slopes of Rancho Palos Verdes, snaking along the not-at-all-smooth blacktop of Palos Verdes Drive. First, you exit at Trump National Golf Club and park in the free lot on the left. Alongside this ritzy golf course and restaurant is a network of public trails. You can follow one down to the water's edge, where wave action has smoothed the many-colored pebbles almost halfway to becoming glass. Of course you could play golf here, too, if you don't mind green fees of $215-$275 for morning starts. Your second stop, father north and west on Palos Verdes Drive, is the Wayfarers Chapel. This is a small but remarkable church – almost all glass walls and skylights, with light filtering in through flanking coastal redwoods.

These factors lie behind a major overhaul of corrections policies designed to save billions and remake the sprawling 33-prison system. The changes would halt some prison construction projects, shutter one facility and bring back some 9,500 inmates from out-of-state lockups. A proposal for a new inmate medical prison would go forward to meet legal challenges. In addition, months-old "realignment" policies that have shipped some 20,000 low-risk inmates to county facilities would continue.
"I did not say she was innocent," said Jennifer Ford, a 32-year-old nursing student. "I just said there was not enough evidence. If you cannot prove what the crime was, you cannot determine what the punishment should be."

It will take time to understand the full impact of this proposal. There is much to like, such as an increase in school construction funding and another year of moderate increases to college tuition. But there are also items of concern. The cuts to Medicaid comprise the largest single spending reduction in this budget. Administration officials say they have found ways to save money without significantly reducing access to health care for the state's poorest residents, but their impact nonetheless warrants close scrutiny. The governor has not yet revealed whether he will seek more revenue for transportation projects, and his proposal assumes a doubling of revenue for the so-called "flush tax" but doesn't explain how that will be accomplished. But at first glance, this budget appears to be a solid starting point for negotiations with the legislature and moves the state toward a more sustainable fiscal future.
The economic and strategic summit, meanwhile, kicked off without a hitch.

The schools cited in the cheating investigation serve mostly poor neighborhoods and have long histories of substandard academic performance. Many of their students come from single-parent homes and lack support from family members in pursuing their studies.

But Kasich’s plan to privatize prisons already has raised questions from a Democratic state representative. The governor’s hand-picked director of the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, Gary Mohr, used to work for Corrections Corporation of America, a Nashville-based private prison operator that could bid to buy one or more of the state’s prisons that are for sale.

Homeowners like to be able to park in front of their houses.

Similarly, cutting funding for preschools is counter-productive. A mountain of research indicates the importance of learning during a child's earliest years.

"The Ridge" alternates between Kimble and Darmus as they unravel the clues French left behind, including the lyrics to a creepy Josh Ritter song ("I can feel the world circling, sniffing round me in the night") and the names and faces of decades' worth of victims of accidents on the ridge. In the process, they uncover a story of 19th-century greed and hubris that embroils Jacqueline and Kimble, Darmus and the deputy, Audrey and her big cats and other residents of Whitman as they struggle to answer their various callings until life's end and sometimes beyond. In the process, the ridge tests each character, especially Kimble and Jacqueline, in ways that are equally emotionally charged and chill-inducing. Like Koryta's other novels, "The Ridge" is particularly powerful when revealing the telling details of those who are isolated — by profession, by geography, by temperament.
