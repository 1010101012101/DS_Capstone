St. Louis does not figure heavily in Araton's book. After all, "Driving Mr. Yogi" is not a full biography. The small number of local scenes, however, show beyond a doubt that when Berra's parents, Pietro and Paulina Berra, 'settled in the tight-knit St. Louis neighborhood of narrow row houses called the Hill - or Dago Hill by the ignorant and intolerant," they were setting a course for their four sons that can never be separated from Yogi's character.

The Vatican also "noted a prevalence of certain radical feminist themes incompatible with the Catholic faith in some of the programs and presentations sponsored by the LCWR, including theological interpretations that risk distorting faith in Jesus and his loving Father who sent his Son for the salvation of the world.

Continued improvement from the offensive line, especially young tackles J'Marcus Webb and Gabe Carimi, is essential because the Bears will face stiffer tests than they did Sunday. The Falcons ranked 20th in sacks last season.

Under existing case law, the agencies can't be sued for ignoring an investment's risks -- only for fraud. The overhaul ends that protection; investors can sue agencies for recklessly ignoring risks. Also, the agencies must explain more fully how they assign ratings. If an agency performs poorly over time, the Securities and Exchange Commission could cancel its registration.

Like its rivals, Tyson is paying more for feed, so it's raising prices and cutting expenses to make up for the extra cost.

The get-back-at-the-rich meme isn't aimed just at the president's fringe-left base. It's also an appeal to the baser instincts of what he believes to be a much greater number of Americans. Obama is betting one of the seven deadly sins can get him re-elected.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement that House Democrats share Obama's "commitment to providing the middle class with a tax cut to grow the economy and create jobs." She noted that a House-passed bill, which Republicans blocked in the Senate, did not include "a bonus tax cut to millionaires and billionaires."

America needs leaders in the truest sense, who are willing to put the nation's good above that of their party or even themselves. Neither Obama nor Republican House Speaker John Boehner could ultimately deliver, but at least they tried to craft a bargain rooted in realism -- the president by offering changes to Social Security and Medicare, the speaker by suggesting closing loopholes to raise revenue. The fact that their parties torpedoed them does not bode well.

Throughout the months in the filthy underground hide-out, Halina remained focused on a place she had never seen, the New York address 3080 Broadway, where her older brother, Leon, was studying at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. The prospect of reuniting with him gave her something to live for, and when she arrived into the waiting arms of Rabbi Wind and his wife and son at La Guardia Airport on Jan. 3, 1947, it marked the beginning of a new life dedicated to honoring both her Jewish heritage and her Catholic rescuers.

With no regrets or the slightest hint of irony, he writes, "I always wanted to be known as the Norman Rockwell of television, and 'Happy Days' represented the part of me that wanted to make mainstream America laugh.

Speakeasies — once underground drinking establishments illegally serving alcohol during the Prohibition era — have made a comeback in recent years as hip, throwback lounges serving premium cocktails and gaining popularity primarily through word of mouth.

There have, of course, always been spiritual autobiographies, as well as "misery memoirs" and personal accounts written by (or credited to) politicians and celebrities. More recently, Yagoda -- the author of a biography of Will Rogers, as well as several books about writing -- notes a spike in memoirs about dogs, addiction, fatherhood and autism, along with the irrepressible insta-memoir phenomenon of "shtick lit" (in which a writer sets out to do something with the express purpose of writing about it). He reels off hundreds of examples, leaving the pages of his book riddled with italicized titles. It's exhausting but effective, revealing a genre distinguished by both its impressive diversity and its depressing sameness.

Rental owners say that they are not responsible for the phishing and that they shouldn't be on the hook for the damages.

I've known Roldan for many years, and many in California feel they also know him personally as the "Baja Beat" columnist with Western Outdoor News. I tracked him down this week at a sports show in Seattle for an update. He's friendly, smart, a good businessman, a great feature writer and a sensational offshore angler. None of that matters if nobody shows up.

Contrary to partisan rhetoric, the economic challenges aren't simple or clear-cut. Wages of middle-class families essentially have been stagnant for years. Global competition has brought fundamental shifts to the American job market. The old high-wage manufacturing jobs aren't coming back. Limited population growth in metro Phoenix and about 60,000 empty houses make it clear the days of rapid-fire construction are in the past or the distant future. Stratospheric home prices and generous home-equity loans no longer exist to mask the shortfall in wages.

Predictably, pressure has already been applied by the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in that state. He alleged that his First Amendment rights were being violated and filed suit. Sharia law has nothing to do with practicing religeous freedom. Mr. Pitts, himself, describes Sharia law. Does he really want that to come here? Depending on how Judge Vickie Miles rules, it could perhaps eventually happen, if she proves to be one of those activist judges who like to legislate from the the Bench to satisfy "political correctness".

You have a communal bond here and an entire city that loves you. If you go to L.A., you'll be going to Kobe's team. If you go to New York, you'll be going to Jeter's town. The fans and media in those cities will rip you apart if you miss a free throw that cost their team a championship. In Orlando, we'd just blame it all on Gilbert.

Blagojevich, former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, former Detroit Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick and former Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens lead a parade of corrupt or simply testosterone-addled politicians who torpedoed their own careers in 2008 and brought down a measure of public trust with them.
• The Daily News' Mike Lupica reminded everyone that the Heat are good: "Understand something: The Knicks got beat, 87-70, by the Heat’s “C” game Thursday night. From the time the Knicks were ahead by that 40-29 at the end of the first half, they scored 30 points the rest of the game. LeBron had a terrible first half, turned the ball over, spent an awful lot of time growling at the refs. Didn’t matter. Didn’t matter that he had to sit down with four fouls (seven minutes and change left in the third quarter) because there was Dwyane Wade to remind you why he is the greatest wing man in the game."
"I'm bitterly disappointed," resident John Maxwell said Tuesday afternoon. "This just shows the deal (with St. Louis County) was already done."

(Alex) Pietrangelo in particular might be hurting after taking a Martin Havlat slapper of the foot then being mercilessly crushed by Ryane Clowe while he was trying to balance on one leg. When the second round starts, they might find themselves the favorites to come out of the West. They seem to have all the pieces. Elliott may have started the playoffs on the bench, but he's proven to be the real thing by posting numbers -- a 1.37 GAA and .949 save percentage -- that somehow bested what he did in his record-setting regular season. Their special teams are clicking, their scoring is balanced and they have a hot, game-breaking hand in McDonald. No reason to think their run stops here."

the sturdy and precise architecture of the Seder which seems limiting, is necessary because only through it can we create memory that is a reliving, and thus experience freedom in the present. As Milan Kundera writes: "Imposing form on a period of time is what beauty demands, but so does memory, for, what is formless cannot be grasped or committed to memory (Slowness p.39)." As with all things, it is only through limitation, in this case through the specific orderly experience of the seder, that we can find true freedom as we did in the ancient exodus, experiencing the transition from slavery to freedom even in the present.

CLEVELAND, Ohio -- About 10 minutes into watching hours and hours of NFL Draft coverage on ESPN and NFL Network, or five minutes into reading about it on various Web sites and Twitter feeds, it became apparent that the majority of national analysts were unwilling to cut the Browns much slack. The slant did not change in the post-draft coverage.

Collins called for a probe of a Van Pelt Watkins' nonprofit group that contracted with Chicago State University to help develop teachers.

"The atmosphere was a total irrational exuberance; it truly was," said Robert Griffin, CEO of Trump Entertainment Resorts, who worked at Trump properties here in the 1980s and 1990s. "There was a feeling that there was no end to the good times and that the money would never end."

"The Beginner's Goodbye," brief as it is, ranks high in the hierarchy of Tyler's works. And what a lineup that is: Her best-known novels are "Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant" (1982) and "The Accidental Tourist" (1985); the latter was made into a quirky, entertaining film in 1988 that starred William Hurt. Her novel "The Amateur Marriage" (2004) was one of the best of the decade, profound in its understanding of how we force ourselves to try, time and time again, to form attachments, and then watch helplessly as, time and time again, they fail.

Notes: Miller was adamant that he was fouled while making a pass with 1:34 and the Blazers trailing 95-93. His pass never made it to Aldridge, instead falling into the hands of Dirk Nowitzki. "They grabbed my whole wrist." On the Blazers' next possession, Miller drove into the key, where he was met by Tyson Chandler and Jason Terry. He lost the ball, and for all intents and purposes, the Blazers lost the game. "They are not going to call that," Miller said. "Maybe at home but not here. I was trying to force them to make a call." ... Nowitzki, who entered as the NBA's fourth leading scorer at 25.2 points per game, struggled until the Blazers tied the game 91-91. After that, he hit his final four shots, finishing with 21 points on 7-of-14 shooting. ... Dallas (20-5) is off to its best start in eight seasons.

But action is required. It is late in the fiscal year. The irresponsible budgeting of the past, coupled with failed tax policies which lie like a heavy, wet blanket suffocating tax revenues and job growth, have required these extraordinary steps. Despite this bold action, remember, we have not taken one dime from classroom instruction, not forced one penny of increase in our property taxes.

ø•With 89 blasts over the fence the past three years, power was pretty much a given when you drafted Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki. So, why only 3 dingers? In the early going, Tulowitzki is hitting far fewer fly balls than usual; to compound the problem, when he does hit the ball in the air, they're clearing the fence less than usual. Other than that, his plate approach is fine - in fact, he's striking out less than usual. There's no cause for panic here. Expect those numbers to revert to normal before long.
The figures put CT scanning for lung cancer on a par with colonoscopy testing for early detection of colorectal cancer, the study found. Both tests are cheaper than the mammograms and Pap tests that most health insurers pay for to screen for breast and cervical cancer.

Inevitably, tension between him and Ferry, the frontman he was constantly threatening to overshadow, forced him to leave Roxy Music. So he became a solo artist, but also formed alliances with similarly inventive musicians, including guitarist Robert Fripp (who had already had major success on his own with prog-rock group King Crimson). “(No Pussyfooting),” their first collection of gorgeous instrumentals — juxtaposing Eno’s richly textured tape loops with Fripp’s melodic but unpredictable guitar solos, came out in late 1973.

Thomas Jefferson believed freedom and ignorance could not coexist. The only place the word "freedom" is mentioned in our Constitution is in the First Amendment, and religion is the first freedom mentioned.

Hey, Hoynsie: I know Buddy Bell was very popular while playing third base for the Tribe for several years. I attended many games back in that period, and it seems to me almost every game I went to, Bell would make one or more errors. I think one game he made three. Overall, isn't Bell considered to have been an above-average fielder?
Stinky Tofu King: The original Rowland Heights branch of Tofu King reigns over a shopping mall alleyway food court. It's a tiny corridor of a shop colored three shades of bright pastel. Patrons can sit at one of the three cramped tables, soaking in the humid perfume of frying stinky tofu, or sit outside at one of the white plastic patio tables. It's still tops for old-school Chinese night-market, street-food charm. There is, of course, the stinky fermented tofu, but another bestseller is mushroom and sliced-pork rice with soy sauce egg, a melty concoction of fatty joy.

In two other cases, Delaney granted consulting contracts to Twin Cities professionals who served with her on the board of the Nursing School's fundraising foundation. Janet Stacey, a member of the foundation board and a vice president at Padilla Speer Beardsley, a public relations and marketing firm, was a principal on a contract for up to $14,000 for an assessment of the school's communications work. Christine Seitz, a past chair of the foundation, has signed five contracts since 2009 worth $114,000, for projects including "strategic repositioning'' of the foundation.

From 2002 through 2005, Traverso said, Jackson was his main supplier of steroid pills, so he could maintain muscle tone without injections. Traverso admitted to the FBI he typically bought 50 to 100 pills of three kinds of steroids at a time, paying Jackson $2 to $3 a pill. In July, FBI agents confiscated two white canisters of steroids from a safe in Traverso's bedroom that he said he bought from Jackson.
The mayor, council and program manager have to refocus on efforts to de-emphasize emptied out parts of the city and on creating incentives -- financial and otherwise -- for Detroiters to move into more concentrated areas. The city simply does not generate enough tax revenue anymore to effectively deliver services across 139 square miles. Bing backed away from the policy implementation of that premise last year. Now, that has to regain currency in the new governance structure.
The consul in charge of the case, Bangfu Wang, said Jiang called him today about the new court date.
The biographies appear in chronological order by birth, which makes for amusing juxtapositions (Zane Grey beside W. Somerset Maugham). In times of rapid cultural change, or when authors are particularly long-lived, the back and forth can get a little see-saw-y. On one page there's a public gay relationship; on the next, decades earlier, there's a female author who needs a masculine pseudonym to get published. Those shifts are disorienting for the reader, yet they fit: They must have been dizzying for the authors to live through.
The edition confirmed three deaths: Navy Lt. George A. Gustin Jr., 24, of St. Louis, killed in the crash of his torpedo bomber; machinist's mate Robert Nickel of Lemay, killed in action; and Pfc. Meredith Cissell, 34, of St. Louis, of illness in the Pacific.
"The criminals did not send us any letter, nor did they send us a message through any of the brothers," he wrote of the Iranians.

With about 40 small breweries in town — new ones open so frequently it's hard to keep track — Portland has overtaken Munich, Germany, as the brewing capital of the world. But numbers alone don't capture Portland's status among true beer aficionados, the kind who would sooner quaff hemlock than a Miller or a Bud. There's something about this most livable of cities that encourages innovation.
Another trustee, Richard Schindell, condemned what he called "secret negotiations" that excluded the trustees from participation. Board member Frank Hundley argued the trustees had waited too long to express their opposition to the takeover by Rowan.

"If someone has a knee or a hip replacement, we tell them to be careful," says Paul Mickiewicz, health director of the Montclair YMCA.

--RHP Luis Marte, who hasn't pitched since suffering a left hamstring pull that landed him on the disabled list April 4, might be gone from Detroit but he's not forgotten. "This poor guy, we felt he was going to be a nice piece for us, or else he wouldn't have made the team," manager Jim Leyland said. "I think about stuff like that; when is he going to be able to throw." Marte felt tightness in his leg in a recent effort to return to pitching and was shut down again, but now is trying to get ready for rehab appearances. He had made the Tigers' opening roster until the injury sidelined him. "It might not sound like a big deal to everybody, but that's important stuff," Leyland said. "It's not fair, just because he's injured, that he's out of the picture, because he's not."

Ferreira, who is Brazilian, also bakes, makes custards and naturally adds some unexpected spin to traditional Cuban desserts. All of her sweet endings come with ice cream, fresh whipped cream and seasonal berries, but I tried to stay purist and ordered a — the word magical is not too melodramatic — coconut flan with passion fruit zabaglione ($9). On my return, I already know my meal will be the Napoleon and the flan and I’ll dance away happy. If coconut isn’t for you, there’s a passion fruit crème brûlée ($9), dulce de leche ($8) and other must-haves, no matter how full you are. They’re large and can be shared, so the hardest part will be agreeing on what to order.

Which means you must make a reservation online before turning up at the unmarked door.
A growing body of promising research had given the researchers some suspicions about what they'd see. In depression and several other psychiatric disorders, studies have begun to detect a pattern of "hyperconnectivity" between three widely scattered "networks" in the brain: the network of structures in which we process emotion and response to threats ("the affective network"); the network of structures that allows us to focus our attention, to reason and make higher-order judgments ("the cognitive control network"); and a cluster of regions that comes alive as a group when our minds are at rest — brain structures that help us ponder the intentions and mental states of others, consider our personal experiences and assess our emotions (dubbed the "default mode network").

Round 5 (pick No. 169): Trent Robinson, S, Michigan State. Robinson is undersized at 5-foot-9, 195 pounds, but he isn’t afraid of contact. He has pretty good range as a deep safety and at times flashed the ability to cover man-to-man in college. He was also a team captain. The Ravens could use a safety who can take away a sizable chunk of the field in case Ed Reed gets injured (or abruptly retires between now and training camp).

“Energy and quickness for my size,” he said. “Run the floor. I’m in great shape, so help out. Help out on pick and rolls, bang a little bit down low, put a big body on some of the guys. Just go to the glass (and) try to get every offensive rebound I can; go after every loose ball and get in there and take some charges and try to do a little bit of everything. Pick and pop. Make some open jump shots. Kind of spread the floor. Make bigger guys come and guard me out on the wing and perimeter.”

-- Megabus is the original and is still probably market leader. It operates in a region bounded by Portland, Me., in the north, Charlotte and Memphis in the South, and Kansas City and Minneapolis to the west. Most routes radiate out up to 400 miles from Chicago, Pittsburgh, New York, and Washington. Typically, Megabus runs a minimum of two round trips daily -- one daytime, one overnight -- with more frequent buses on many routes. Fares are capacity-controlled, starting out very low -- as low as $5 each way -- and increasing as the trip fills. Seating is guaranteed. A Canadian affiliate operates similar services linking the main cities in the corridor from Montreal to Niagara Falls, with cross-border service to Buffalo and Buffalo airport -- popular with air travelers who want to avoid Canada's heavy fees on international air trips.

Those are all very un-Brady like numbers. And like many teams that have done business in the salary cap era in the NFL who also happen to have the once-in-a-lifetime guy behind center, the Patriots have leaned on Brady more and more each year to get them into the postseason as they've struggled to keep their roster together.
"Not having the OTA's and all that kind of stuff, we kind of just threw him to the wolves, so to speak," said Jets coach Rex Ryan. "But he has done a good job. Last week, I think he caught six or seven balls. Derrick is the same guy he was there for all those years. He is an excellent receiver, he can catch the football with anybody. He is doing a good job here."

Although the Nets had some fascinating flashes in Commack, Island Garden and the Nassau Coliseum, they won entirely too much (two titles) and showcased way too many classy chassis for a budding misanthropist.

The climax which features a man-ape showdown on the Golden Gate Bridge results in some puzzling questions, like why is the ape population of the greater San Francisco metropolitan area roughly the same as all of sub-Saharan Africa?

Hey, Tony: I predicted that the Browns will go 4-12. If things continue as they have, we will have two major issues to address -- dropped passes and run defense. Everyone thinks we will draft a receiver with the first pick. Elite receivers aren't there as they were last year. If the Browns do go 4-12 they will have a top five pick and if Atlanta loses a couple more we will have their pick in the top 15 or 20 at worst. Do you think that the Browns would target RB Trent Richardson and LB Vontaze Bufict with the second pick in the first round? Next to Andrew Luck, Richardson is considered the safest pick and Burfict would finally give us Ray Lewis' attitude and allow D'Qwell Jackson to move to the strong side. -- Doug Furtado, Vermilion

Ms. Mossburg asserts that the state's performance is significantly lower than large mutual funds, and she provides examples of two mutual funds that outperformed the state pension system over the most recent decade. What she fails to do is conduct a performance attribution to determine why. The two mutual funds included in the article are predominantly invested in bonds. The last decade saw two periods of significant decline in the stock market, and a steady rise in bonds as yields fell to near historic lows. So naturally, a concentrated bond portfolio would outperform a more diversified portfolio. How easy it is to identify outperforming assets after the fact with the benefit of hindsight. In fact, Morningstar, a leading provider of independent investment research, comments that one of the funds included in the article "could struggle in relative terms when rates rise from their recent, near-historical lows."

The men who blended the image of Kentucky’s frontier origins with its genteel Southern aristocracy (paralleled today in the contrast between the chaotic infield at Churchill Downs and the elegance of Millionaires Row in the clubhouse) guided the Derby through depressioas, world wars and a federal assault on gambling laws. Their true tales add to the race’s legend.
Whitman had the state Economic Development Authority issue $2.8 billion in bonds in 1997 to raise revenue for the state pension system. The borrowing allowed her to skip the annual payment into the pension system and spend the money that would have been allocated for the payment on other budget priorities. The arrangement was challenged in court at the time because the state constitution prohibits borrowing without voter approval. But by borrowing through the authority, even though it relied on state appropriations to pay off the bonds, the issue was not scuttled in court. Many governors now routinely skip all or at least part of the annual pension payment – Christie did so this year – leaving an unfunded liability estimated at $46 billion as of the last count.
