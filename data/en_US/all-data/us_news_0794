Although they are rivals, I like the fact that the Pacific Division is doing so well. I think we might have the best division in hockey. That’s why the points were down in our division. Nobody had 110 points simply because too many good teams are playing each other.

University High in Tolleson takes a more traditional approach. The school doesn't always accept students with the best academic records.

At one point, the rest of the committee was deadlocked, 2-2, on the water rate. Decker was asked repeatedly his position to break the tie, and his response over and over was “make a motion and you will find out.” This required the committee to take action both ways, with Decker voting “no” each time.

John McCain would, but then he’s a war hero who learned the hard way what real communists are like. These new would-be party leaders are no heroes. In fact, they are not so much leaders as they are cheerleaders turning cartwheels to please the most bellicose voices in the crowd.
A half-dozen staffers scramble to clear a path as Joe Baschnagel is wheeled in.
Los Angeles has a bike plan, and it's a fine idea. We have quite enough cars and quite enough drivers, thank you very much, and the counter-stereotypical truth is that we also have thousands and thousands of bicyclists who would gladly leave the car in the garage (or not buy one in the first place) and take to the pedals if only we could make enough room for them on the pavement.

One can debate the details of both proposals (extending the 6 percent sales tax to gasoline might make more sense than raising the wholesale tax to the nation's highest rate, for instance), but there's clearly much benefit for the money. If advocates can make their case and demonstrate exactly when and where the money would be spent, we suspect the public will support such worthwhile investment even if it means paying 75 cents a day for it.
Deanna also enjoyed it.
During the same month this year, it was 201 spots - far below the 377-space capacity.
Seattle. Disliking Vancouver is akin to disliking Switzerland - their harmless and never hurt anybody. I know what the nicknames are, but I choose not to use them. I think we are much more creative than what those nicknames would imply.

We are, however, perhaps the top firm that represents African governments in Washington. In addition to Egypt—where, despite all the skepticism by reporters like the one who called me, they have embarked on an election process few thought was possible a year ago,-- we’re working with the government in Kenya as they implement their new US-like constitution. And we have a decade-old relationship with the Kingdom of Morocco as they continue to be the most progressive Arab/Muslim country on earth.

Here's another concern: The scanners and pat-downs are a blatant invasion of privacy. A thirtysomething Internet sensation from California has been whining about his "junk," creating the impression that he'd been asked to turn his head and cough. This is pure kvetching.

Although the beta version is robust regarding getting the lowest fares, it still has a way to go on stations. At this point, the "airport choice" pull-down menus do not show rail stations as alternatives, so the system doesn't work if you want to go to/from specific rail stations. An inquiry for a rail trip from Paris Charles deGaulle to Lyon/Satolas (the only option available for Lyon) returned mainly trips from Paris/Gare du Lyon to Lyon's main downtown rail stations, but not to/from the airport stations. Presumably, TripAdvisor will adjust to this problem in due time.
The Reds drew within one in the eighth against Jason Grilli when Zack Cozart doubled home Devin Mesoraco. Grilli struck out Drew Stubbs and intentionally walked Votto to get to Brandon Phillips, who struck out swinging as Grilli pumped his fist.

Buffett is a master showman: humble, affable, amusing and seemingly as comfortable as any human can possibly be. He joked all night about aliens and spaceships after telling a story about his trumpeter, John Lovell, reportedly seeing a UFO the night before. He also thanked his audience all night. Before he departed for the final time, he traversed the stage twice, bowing and waving thank yous at fans all over the arena.

"Deforce": This painstakingly detailed, frank and unflinching work takes a deep dive into the sociopolitical roots of Detroit's path from boom to bust and its continuing struggle for effective leadership. The long, painful history of systemic racism and corporate greed and recent examples of civic corruption all come under fire. The comprehensive approach of the film is particularly useful for those who might not know the scope of Detroit's past challenges. But even those familiar with the tale will be struck by the veritable perfect storm of obstacles that the city has faced and, against the odds, survived. The 2011 movie, from director Daniel Falconer (who was born in Detroit and raised in Oakland County) has been praised by legendary documentarian Ken Burns as "an essential study."
GRAND THEFT, MADISON AVENUE: A man walked out of Bonnie and Clyde’s Bar to find that his 1997 Dodge Caravan was missing from the parking lot Jan. 22. He still had the keys to the vehicle.
Moss and Crabtree are having a blast, pushing each other, competing, talking a little trash. This could be Crabtree's first full offseason participating in the scheduled routine considering injuries limited the 2009 No. 10 overall draft pick in recent years and he held out for 71 days as a rookie. And Moss is already setting a positive example by sprinting off the line on every snap and encouraging his teammates. He handed off his water bottle to a thirsty Joe Hastings at one point.

Most people don’t think about how the borough is able to fund events like the summer concerts or the Independence Day Celebrations, especially in these fiscally challenging times. In fact, the borough has not funded these events or the street fair, Farmers Market, 5K race or Christmas Walk for the past several years. Instead, the local business community generously stepped in to provide the funding and manpower so that New Providence could continue to offer outstanding celebrations and activities for the enjoyment of residents and visitors.

After BNY Mellon reported its third-quarter earnings in late October, Hassell told Reuters that his new upstart adversaries in transaction analysis were "dense" and didn't understand the nature of the custody bank's forex business. The bank has said some of the analysis is flawed because it compares large negotiated trades, which typically have lower profit margins, to small transactions involving hard-to-trade currencies.

Peruvian cuisine has come down from the mountains to spread through Portland in recent years, starting with Andina and extending to Las Primas, opening in North Portland this month. Limo, a laid-back, reasonably priced place with most of its seating outside (at least in this weather), does some remarkable things, some even involving actual cooking. It can also be inconsistent, and when things get busy, service can break down.

Medical student Pavan Vaswani is not a typical recipient. He and his father bought an Upper Fells Point rowhouse in 2010 for $285,000. The younger Vaswani lives there, and the state pays 84 percent of his property tax, under a sliding scale that caps an owner's tax bill based on income.

By all appearances, Iowa Buffet is an average south St. Louis tavern: corner-hugging, architecturally modest, and emanating the potentially off-putting but not overwhelming scent of cigarette smoke. Make sure to introduce yourself to Carol, the warm and inviting owner who leads a great cast of characters including loyal regulars, barbecue master Dave (who "came with the bar" when Carol bought it 25 years ago) and a generations-old gas broiler kept alive with scavenged parts.

The striking feature of many poems in "Double Shadow" is the way Phillips' style distributes this balance, so that no particular line or image in a poem bears any more weight than another. Strangely, this equilibrium can feel quite unsettling. We grow used to looking for particular hot zones within poems, but the poems in "Double Shadow" keep moving and gesturing. Usually, they don't allow readers high points at which to stop and admire and sum up, which often makes them fascinating.

You have to put a lot of work in the day-to-day because it is a studio. Everyone here is here to do the best creative work possible. There are only a few role players.

"The Omnivore's Dilemma" is a highly interesting and sometimes sickening book. It is also very educational. It teaches you all about food: where food comes from, what's in it, and even why people overeat. For example, did you know that corn is in just about everything? From food to batteries, to aspirin and even fireworks?

I was driving down Highway 94 (March 22), and as I passed QuikTrip at Kisker Road, I was going south, I noticed a lady next to me in a white Cadillac Escalade. I would guess she was in her mid- to late 50s. She was busy texting. She drove very erratically all the way down the highway. I got down to Wolfrum Road and she whizzed through a red light like you wouldn't believe, still busy texting. And she's old enough to know better. Wake up, lady, you could have been dead.

Springsteen’s folk melodies and blue-collar storytelling resonate with audiences hungry for narrative, sympathetic characters and singalong choruses. But the success of "Springsteen" has implications far beyond Music City. It suggests that the experience that Church is describing is one familiar to listeners of all kinds, and that the Boss is once again operating as a marker of emotional resonance. After the fatalism of "Magic" and the escapism of "Working on a Dream," it sometimes felt like Springsteen belonged to a prior generation of entertainers. The "Wrecking Ball" effort has brought him back where he belongs: in the center of the conversation about popular music. Mission accomplished, Bruce.
