The ovaries are a pair of almond-shaped organs that lie in the pelvis on either side of the uterus. The fallopian tubes connect the ovaries to the uterus.
Everyone in Britain has quite rightly heard of Stephen Lawrence and the white savages who murdered him, but how many have heard about Mary-Ann Leneghan? This poor white girl was only sixteen years old when she and a friend were abducted, tortured, and raped by Joshua and Jamaile Morally, Indrit Krasniqui, Llewellyn Adams, Michael Johnson and Adrian Thomas. Mary-Ann was eventually murdered (her friend survived).
However, the five outfits for Monday to Friday must centre around 10 items and that includes shoes and boots.

It is Wednesday...yeah! That means I am linking up with Lindsay for some serious outfit inspiration. This is a place where we stay accountable for not staying in sweats, pjs, or yoga pants all day. Won't you join us?

Wholesome Nutritional Brown Rice & Diversified Carbohydrates
I've had this recipe on the back-burner for a few months now... I made this for a brunch potluck and never had a chance to work on my modifications and revise it. I based it off of this recipe by the Gluten Free Cooking School - the original recipe includes brown rice and is fried, so I modified it to bake it and replaced the rice with sweet potato and a few other adjustments here and there... My friend Anne said I hijacked this recipe so this is dedicated to you Anne- sorry it took so long! :)

Current fracking technology, involving a number of factors (like “slick water” cocktails) that make it possible did not coalesce so as to permit what the industry is now undertaking until 2007. The minimum expected gas fracking wells to be drilled in Pennsylvania are expected to be at least 100,000. So far, only 2.6% of that number or 2,600 have been initiated.

Everything in Alexander Outland begins with Nap. He's Koch's first person narrator and moral center (If I asked Nap, I'm sure he'd rather be the center of a babe sandwich). Not the kind of man a woman would bring home to mom, he does hold a certain charm. "You don’t date a guy like Nap to give him a list of acceptable behaviors. You date a guy like Nap BECAUSE he’s a guy like Nap. We do love the bad boys, you know," says Koch. Despite his irascible behavior Nap's a do-gooder at heart, more sexually overt Han Solo, with a dash of Mal Reynolds completes the picture.

WHAT WE ORDERED
So last night I got the chance to catch up with some old friends. We sat around reminiscing about the stupid stuff we used to do together...or rather, the stupid stuff I would do while they watched, and inevitably the snake story was brought up...

For the first time in human history, we can shop for life partners the same way that we shop for anything else. Instead of trusting in others’ wisdom, we rely on algorithms that automatically suggest the most compatible partners. There have always been many fish in the sea—we’ve just never before had access to them.
"I think I probably know about 100 of them. If you go to the folk awards and look around you can make an educated guess about who they are. There are two levels: the general level and the people who are behind the major awards like the lifetime achievement award. That's up to the company - Smooth Operations", which is contracted by the BBC to produce some radio shows, including Mike Harding's, as well as the folk awards.
So, if I don’t really care about races, why do I run? I’m not motivated by losing weight or such (although looking good is a nice side-effect). I don’t run with people most of the time, so it’s not for companionship (although it would be nice to have a few buddies who ran again). So, why?
This quilt is based on a vintage photo of a quilt that I stumbled upon accidentally several years ago. I have no idea who made it or when, but I was so intrigued that I felt I HAD to have the pattern for the blocks. It was quite difficult to figure out! I can actually remember sweating during the process!
I can not stress enough how excited both boys were. Not only did they get to hear their name on the announcements, they got to leave their classrooms for a special trip to the library. Alex burst in with a huge smile and Nate walked into the library with what could only be called a swagger. It was one of the highlights of kindergarten for me to get to be at the library and witness this.
At the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary in Brisbane, Australia guests can pet koalas — hopefully one of the better-tempered ones.
By 9:30, the coffee had worn off and I was dreading the half hour drive back to Levittown, but the desire to see what was next overpowered the need to sleep. I was not disappointed and I don’t think the crowd was either, when they were presented with none other than the beloved fairy tale, Cinderella. No, not the Walt Disney version. I’m talking the 1970s, softcore porno musical starring Cheryl Smith as the titular heroine and Sy Richardson as the gay, African American fairy godmother (no, I’m not making this up). This one’s guaranteed to put your jaw on the floor; it’s pure sexploitation, and a real joy to the eyes and the funny bone. It was hard not to get a kick out of it.
To be honest, I think I’ve developed a wee bit of resentment. Because I was doing everything right, and right in the middle of doing it right, I had the worst back injury I’ve ever had. And so…yeah. Saying it out loud makes me realize I’m behaving like a buffoon.

Lastly is a small section on how Sauber pioneered current gearbox design with a longitudinal gearbox, with the gears ahead of the final drive and contained within an aluminum case. It surprised me that Harvey Postlethwaite was involved in this, is there anything that man didn’t do in F1?
A voice suddenly boomed around them. Dylan started. Its resonance echoed off the walls and broke Aislinn’s trance. The beam of light winked out and her eyelids fluttered open. She withdrew her hands from the still glowing skull.

OSNOVA’s Kindle edition offers the excellent formatting and navigation that Christians have come to expect from OSNOVA Kindle publications. The OSNOVA Kindle edition incorporates an active table of contents, a joystick navigation between chapters and books, and a cross-reference system between the commentary and the included Bible (with Direct Verse Jump 2), which makes it easy to locate any place within the Commentary or the Scriptures in seconds. The table of contents allows navigation to any chapter of the Scriptures, with the hyperlinked dot to the right of each chapter leading to the corresponding place in the Commentary. Each title and each verse number in the included Bible is hyperlinked to the corresponding passage in the Commentary, and each reference in the Commentary is hyperlinked to the corresponding passage in the Bible. The complete instructions on how to use all navigation aids in this publication are found at the beginning of the book.

The palate is rich and concentrated, but very savoury with fresh acidity and balance.
Later in the same Psalm it says this: This is my comfort in my misery, Your word gave me new life. Now if that don’t get your blood pumping, nothing will. Too often we focus on the negative and think of all that we have done wrong. Sure there is plenty, since compared to God, our best is like filth. But God’s promise is forgiveness to those who ask. This is total forgiveness of any and all that we ask for. He promises new life and new beginnings. If you have never received forgiveness and salvation, you ask and get a new start. My favorite verse in the Bible is this one: 2 Corinthians 5:17 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. What an amazing offer, a new start in exchange for total screw ups!

This month also brought my return to work :( Devastated doesn't even cover it. I came back two days after the Christening. At least I had one day home alone with him to snuggle, cuddle and cry. I don't think I've ever bawled so much in my life. Thankfully Kieran does the morning drop offs otherwise I don't think I would have ever been able to physically leave. We are so lucky to have an amazing sitter so any issues are solely on my part. I have every ounce of trust in her.
No, Sue, thank you but you don’t need to worry about me. I’m out of that world and I have a day job and a family. That’s enough hard work, I don’t need thugs and Russians and bulletproof vests anymore! But I worked in an industry where these people existed. If I hadn’t, I probably wouldn’t be able to write credibly about them. Obviously, the books are a fictional exaggeration of the jobs and the people I worked with (and if they weren’t fictionalised, I’d still say that they were!) but those types, mindsets, even some of the lesser events (though not all) are based in reality. And that should give the books the credibility they need as a background to what the characters do and how they act. Because, to get back to your first point, I’m more interested in why something happens and how people react to that, than the event itself. (Have I dodged that question well enough?)

I think that Mr. G is conspiring against me. I realized it last night when I finally came down from the cough-medicine haze and asked him if he would check the thermostat. I said, "I'm hot. Will you check the thermostat?" which clearly means, "Please make sure it is set to my required 68 degrees Fahrenheit so that I don't die of heat stroke in the night." He said, "Yes," which apparently means, "The thermostat is set well above 68 degrees but I wouldn't turn it down even the shingles were sliding off of the roof in the form of molten lava."
I love round windows to begin with, but this back to back half circle is a winner of a design and a keeper. When you see a feature window from the outside, you can’t help but wonder where it appears inside. Well we know where this one is – perfectly placed over the bath. LOVE…

Bully-proofed children are self-assured and resilent, they are rarely victims. They make great choices with friends, and they find each other even in the toughest of settings. I am well aware that many of these suggestions go against the grain for many parents: think of it like losing weight – life changes not temporary solutions. Also, expect that the first month will be hard work: you’re all unlearning and relearning, just keep consciously making the changes. Few current bullying programmes work: perhaps, in the end, it’s time to think outside the box.
Since I already wrote a bit about that yesterday, deciding to take it in my own direction. Today, and everyday, I am grateful for art. I am grateful that my toddler , Marlee, can say "colorrrrr" and find crayons and that my preschool-age daughter, Lucy, can say "Mom, let's go stamp!" As they say at CRESENDOh, art saves. Art saved me, and I hope one day, when my kids feel sad, or like they need an outlet, art will save them too.

Still, physical fitness for the non-professional was largely the province of people with enough money to have leisure time. Subsistence farmers and day laborers didn’t have the luxury of pursuing “rock-hard abs” and “buns of steel.” And so, the Austin Athletic Club was initially open only to private subscribers, though it was later sold to the City in 1931, to serve at Austin’s first community recreation center.
Lappe’s book also argued that meat-centered diets are unhealthful for both people and the environment, and converted many to its ideas. In 1987, John Robbins published Diet for a New America, in which he makes a strong point against the health issues of a meat-centered diet, and against the cruelty inflicted on animals from modern factory farming.

That out of the way, Rudisha took a shot at a fast time zipping to a 1:41.33 in Rieti – the #5 time ever behind the last four WR runs! He then went to Brussels and won, before ending the season in Milan in his only loss of the year as young Mohamed Aman (ETH) – third in Rieti in 1:43.35 – turned the tables 1:43.50 to 1:43.57, ending Rudisha’s 26 race winning streak. The 17 year old Aman set a World Youth Record with his race in Rieti, and along with Kaki should be a nemesis of Rudisha’s for years to come.

I hear a voice, but I don't understand what it is saying. I did understand what it meant. Instinct takes over and I begin to move with a renewed purpose. A man stands at the top of the stairs. He is speaking to me, and it makes me desire him. I attempt to make my way to him. My hair is hanging down covering my face, and my clothing is soaked through from the rain.
The consequences have been obvious and deplorable. A number of publications exist merely for the purpose of reviewing Fringe shows, and young people are recruited by these publications, sometimes without knowledge or appreciation of the genres they are sent to review.

It's only January 1st and already this coming year is going to be crazy! We put an offer in on a new home (our dream home) and it was accepted on Saturday so we will be moving in 40 days! Which is crazy nuts because we haven't sold our condo but are going to try renting it otherwise who the hell knows. All we know is it's the right thing to do for our family because we need more space and are ready to move on. In the meantime I'm almost 5 months pregnant with baby girl #2...which is why we need more space!
King George has called upon “my people at home and my peoples across the seas.” He continued: “I ask them to stand calm, firm and united in this time of trial. The task will be hard.

So I met this guy, and I knew he was a total player. I’d been with players before, and although they are sexy, they usually didn’t call like after. So I decided to to follow this book’s rules. And it was not easy. I met this great guy, who didn’t know what to think about me. He was good looking and had a great body and all, but we were in his car and he played me a song that he wrote and that’s when I knew he was the one. Most importantly, like all the girls I know who read this book, we all got our man. One girl I know even got engaged!!! So try the steps and see if it works for you! See if you get your own HAPPILY EVER AFTER!!!
"It's difficult to think anything but pleasant thoughts while eating a homegrown tomato." ~ Lewis GrizzardStorms broke out dead tree tops and littered the yard with limbs and leaves. Pinecones pelted the metal sunroom roof, sounding more like giant hailstones and the wind caught up anything that was not tied down. The grow box with these tiny tomatoes bowed to the power of the wind and rolled to the edge of the deck, then toppled over and down the steps losing a bit of dirt, several large branches and scattering tiny green tomatoes all over the stone patio. I repaired the damage as best possible: replacing the dirt and the soil cover, tying up the vines and relocating the box to be sheltered from future winds.

Little did the kind commuters realize the healing they had brought about by their simple actions. I picked up one of the oranges.

Then today, yeah, kidney stone. I haven't had one for over a decade, but that is a pain you don't forget. I'm consuming large doses of Vit C and drinking gallons of water, in hopes I'm better by tomorrow morning. The State cut off my health insurance as soon as I started this job. If I have to take tomorrow off, I will need to go to the emergency room to get a Dr. note. Just pay them what I can every week. I have to wait until open enrollment next fall to get insurance through my job.
As a hip-hop fanatic, I advocate all different hip-hop scenes especially the one that’s occurring in Lebanon. This phenomenon is somewhat new to the Lebanese society for it is merely a form of music but rather an evolution of expression giving voice to many that are unheard. Reaching out is especially important to a country that has experienced and still experiences political and social turmoil leaving many of its own unacknowledged. Thus hip-hop here has transcendent from being classified as music to being classified as a ‘Movement’.
Things are still going well. There have been some crazy financial issues that have arisen (like my mortgage lender raising my rate $125, which I had removed, by the way!), but I have always been good with money. I feel constantly blessed that I got the job I did because without that opportunity, none of this would be possible. I also feel incredibly blessed to have a mom who is way too overbearingly supportive! :)
Every New Year’s Day we would all get together at my grandfather’s home in Bayou Portage. Like all of his French-speaking neighbors, our grandparents would slowly simmer a big pot of black-eyed peas promising next year’s good luck. There also was one of smothered cabbage, guaranteed to bring us money, also on Grandma’s kitchen table.
We’ll have to see how that goes…
The slaughters then in Iraq and Afghanistan and now in Pakistan and Yemen, are remote to us. They come to us in thirty second bites on the evening news or as crawls at the bottom of the screen. We talk about bombings and air strikes and killing as casually as we discuss the weather, as if what is being done in our name is of no consequence to us, as if other life has no meaning. We weep for the baby in a well but close our eyes to the babies in hell.
This talk of beaches is almost making me long for the end of winter. Almost. I mean, I'd really like to have a good, heavy, deep snow that sticks around for a few days, causes school to be cancelled and gives the kids plenty of good snowman making material. We haven't had 2" of snow TOTAL all winter! This just isn't right. We need it. We need a few days for folks to have to stay at home, giving all of these nasty bugs and viruses a chance to die off. Everyone has had more than their fair share of the crud this winter. Most of all, I think everyone needs to be reminded to slow down. Nothing like a good snow to show you who's in charge. ; )

Ohhh, that’s right, you WERE up there, weren’t you?

Well, it might not make people actively happy, but I would think it is a racing certainty that a dose of hallucinogenic mushrooms would tend to take the person’s mind off whatever was depressing him/her in the first place. There’s nothing like fifteen goblins armed with antelopes emerging from a banana to distract you from what you thought were your previous troubles.

At first, I talk to the children about their "1st grade lines" or their "big kid lines" (because big kids write in the lines). I tell them that there's a head line (I put my hands on my head), mid line (hands on my hips), and a base line (hands on down). I tell them that SOME letters "hang their bottoms down"
The cost of this has been paid also in a social condition which apologists call “mobility,” implying that it has been always “upward” to a “higher standard of living,” but which in fact has been an ever-worsening unsettlement of our people, and the extinction or near-extinction of traditional and necessary communal structures.

The other thing that’s ‘tipped me off’ is the current crop that seems to be constantly decorating my welcome matt.

So now the question is whether or not I can go to sleep tonight without hopping on WoW. . .
So far, the defiant response from Cairo has been attributed mostly to government figures with links to the deposed Mubarak regime, including the anti-Western minister for international cooperation, Fayza Abul-Naga. The military-appointed Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri – who also served during the Mubarak era – told reporters last Wednesday that the authorities “won’t change course because of some aid.”
This time and the last time I saw Duran Duran - about a year and a half ago? - I noticed, most of all, the men in the audience. Now, I had me plenty of gay male friends that were into them, back in the day, and yes, there were plenty of life partners there last night, being very cute and latter-day preppy and all that. But, I think, perhaps cutest of all, to me, is the straight male contingent at their shows. These guys - my age - are self-conscious, a bit, at first. Then, a beer or two in, the band plays some kick-ass, danceable oldie like "Planet Earth," or "Rio," and then these big ol', teddy-bear type straight men start bopping around and singing all the words. They make me happy.

He grew up, married, had a son, got divorced and now he lives with a partner and is an openly gay sports writer. How could his life experiences have not brought out a more compassionate attitude towards all people? What must his childhood have been like for him to hate children so much that he would post a opinion piece about it on CNN. Or maybe it's their parents he hates.

"Quadriga" is on top, and she is flanked on two lower pedestals by "Army" and "Navy" — dramatic and surprisingly action-packed sculptures, with swords and guns and muskets and even a trident or two popping every which way.

He also criticises the system of loans to grow cotton and how merchants except only cotton crops as security on these loans meaning that the poor are forced into growing crops that don’t give them the best profit. And therefore stops them from getting out of poverty, and indirectly stops them from working hard. Why work hard if you wont get anything for it? This particular argument feels very relevant today with regards to third world debt and the subprime mortgages.
”We are leaving,” R said politely. He stood in front of The Cardinal´s chair, a simple thing but it made him think of a throne, there was still such an air of sovereignty around the man.

Second, it’s remote. Although it’s the forth largest state geographically, it is in the bottom 5 for population; there are just barely a million people here. The ratio is about 1.1 people per square mile in the state. So every person living in Montana has space to have their own mile. Not an acre, or block. But MILE. It seems the majority of towns throughout the state have populations of less than 10,000. The US government considers any town with a population of less than 50,000 to be rural. According to that measurement, a person can count on one hand the number of towns/cities in Montana that do not count as rural. Butte has about 30,000 (still rural) and it’s by far and away the big city around here.
That is the day she stops watching her feet. It makes no difference when each patch of sky looks the same, and each branch above her splits in the same indistinguishable way. Even so, when she closes her eyes, she can hear it, louder than anything: the chime of the grandfather clock in her front hallway, the creak of pipes in her ancient house, calling her from far away.
I didn't have grade 3s today (due to NAPLAN being on at the same time as their strings lessons), so this super short skirt was not overly impractical. That said, when combined with the stockings, I felt my legs were being stared at all day.

There, at the far end of this grassy field where three hedgerows join is a small copse closing in an otherwise invisible corner of the field. Directly at the entrance of this little secluded corner is an old water well — a well covered and overgrown by years of non-use and neglect. This is certainly a forgotten place.
Personification: Love I hope that I can display the fruit of love by spreading the word of God today and everyday for the rest of my life. The only way that we can truly love our neighbor is by preparing them for eternity, not ignoring their plight and eventual judgement. I don’t know exactly what this sharing looks like yet, but I hope I am doing it and I will be looking for new ways to do it as well.
It is said that the foremost expert on the human heart was Sir William Shakespeare. (He wasn’t really a knight, but it doesn’t feel right to speak his name without a title.) Sir William’s insight about love was the fickleness of the whole thing. The moral of A Midsummer Night’s Dream is that when Cupid’s arrow strikes you can fall for anyone – your best friend’s fiancé, a fairy, or even a jackass. It’s a fair point, but there’s one thing about the Bard’s lovelorn characters that doesn’t quite ring true: they are constantly talking. I’ve seen enough of humans in love to know that their condition makes them dopey and inarticulate. Yet Shakespearian lovers can’t stop whining about their heartache to anyone who’ll listen. In fact, they keep on chattering about it even when they’re alone.
Feeling really happy, I decided to do the head (toilet). It’s new. I had poured water and vinegar down it a while back to clean and test it out and it leaked at the output. I undid the outlet tube and found a bunch of salt(?) chippings and a broken elbow! You can’t believe how happy I am to have found this before actually “using” this thing. Whoever installed it deserves to find a “dump” on his front door step!
Excitingly I was back in the States judging at the Great American Beer Festival and it was just as much of a blast as it was last year, if not more, and you can see the results here but, very quickly, I’d like to make special mention for Jeff Bagby & his crew at the Carlsbad Pizza Port for winning medal after medal and taking large brewpub of the year – he’s an absolute sweetheart, his fiancée Dande is a honey - I can’t think of nicer people to win the award.

There is one type of script that is absolutely perfect for the spec market – this one. If you come up with a contained horror scenario that's intense, that has immediacy, and that's a little bit different from what’s come in the past, somebody will buy it. Shit, I’LL buy it. You can make these movies for a cheap price AND they’re easy to market. So they’re always going to be in high demand.
The cut in rates follows weeks of mounting pressure on the RBA board amid news of slowing growth, benign inflation and increasing cries for help from manufacturers, home builders, retailers, tourism operators and exporters.
This was just amazing to watch. Poehler and Rudolph give their characters an incredible chemistry you just can’t fake – it feels like they’ve spent the last 12 months touring as Betty and Jodi. And I swear that most of the flirting between the girls and guys was improvised. Even the SILENCES were funny – the girls came onto the guys, who sat there wide-eyed and chewed their gum. And then the guys returned the favor, leaving Betty and Jodi in shock (Samburg: “If my wife got hit by a bus, you know what I’d hit? You two.”). When a sketch has such a high level of purity that you forget you’re watching something scripted, there’s no choice but to give it a….

And at that, Mariage Frères is the best. Hundreds of flavors of black, green, and even red teas (there weren't so many red tea choices back then), all intoxicating. So a week or so before leaving Paris, I took a morning trip and loaded up a big bag full of all kinds of yummies. This was my Planned Purchase #1 when heading off to Paris--kilos of tea, half old favorites, half new flavors. As a result, I've discovered (now that I'm back home) several new "favorites" that will be the first I'll need to replace.
2. Planning your work. Sure, as writers, we like to think that we’re fly-by-the-seat-of-our-pantaloons creative types, that we go where our bliss leads us or whatever. And perhaps that works for some people. But for me – and for most of the writers I’ve been lucky enough to talk with who have had any success in this world – writing must be approached like a business, or at least like a job. It takes planning and dedication. You lay out a strategy, whether it’s an outline or a brainmap, or whatever your choice of tool might be. If you know what you’re sitting down to accomplish, you’ll spend a lot less time staring at the screen.

At 7 a.m., my heavy sleeper woke up and was ready to go. It would have been a great morning to stay in bed and read, what with the wind, rain and lightening, but it was just too hot to lock ourselves in, and nothing on the island (ie. nature center) was open, so short of hanging out in the restroom or sweltering in the trailer, there weren't many options. So we packed up (I got a freshwater shower in the process) and headed to Marathon Key where we happened upon "Stuffed Pig," a local favorite breakfast spot. Pecan pancakes and other treats hit the table minutes before the lightening FIRST struck just across the street. KABOOM! Midway through our meal, KABOOM again! Certainly the most EXCITING breakfast we've experienced.

In 1904 the archaeologist Carlos Cisneros published The Atlas of Peru which contained a survey of all the known archaeological sites in Peru.

I’m going to tell you the bad first. My husband wasn’t there. I was going to say it wasn’t his choice, but, actually, it was. You see, my daughter didn’t invite him.

One key feature here is a new command-prioritizing scheme that prioritizes DDR4 commands when they enter the command queue (like the DDR3 version of this controller) and then reprioritizes the commands when they’re about to exit from the queue, to be issued to the DDR4 memory. That part’s new. This new feature allows high-priority commands to go straight to the head of the command queue when they’re received, but controller can delay the command’s exit from the queue (and the issue of that command to the memory) until the target DDR4 memory page and bank are ready to accept that command. This capability reduces the impact of high-priority commands and helps to maximize memory bandwidth and throughput.

PMcC – There is no doubt the Mr McBride would have been better presenting the defence case than Tommy Sheridan was. After all, he is a vastly experienced QC! However, the defence case started with an eminent QC, Maggie Scott, instructed. Unlike in the civil trial, when an apparent blunder by Sheridan’s legal team caused him to dispense with their services, there was nothing in this case which, on the surface precipitated her sacking.
To clarify that idea let us use an example of a success and worldwide online retailer. EBay is the most popular online auctioning website which allows people/small business to create a site to sell their products without costs on storage capacity, employees, and office rentals and so on therefore making it worth selling small quantities of a product but having the opportunity to have a high variety of different products.

Consequently, a high point for me was a panel discussion featuring three brewers who also distill, and without going into great detail, each of them offered thoughts on certain "traditional" distilling practices (mashing, fermentation) from the perspective of the contemporary generation of craft brewers, and how old-timey distillers could learn from New Age brewers. I'm sure these thoughts would constitute heresy in some quarters, and as such, I was thrilled to hear them. Throughout human history, heresy has been the most useful precondition for revolution. I might become a spirits drinker yet.
We still don’t really understand the appeal. The stuff is a bit like my father-in-law’s “Christmas bread”, which the entire family has been boycotting for years. Our opinion doesn’t matter, though– the supply keeps growing. Instead of a little end-display by the registers, or a little space in the cookie aisle, they seem to be taking over the whole store. They occupy the entire top shelves in the cookie aisle, the tea aisle, and the yogurt aisle.

This is such a Cinderella story. A woman transformed by finding love. When we meet Thea she’s a confirmed spinster. Completely entrenched in the boring life of a Vicar’s sister. It only takes one meeting from Gabriel to begin to crack away at that stodgy facade. Out come rosy cheeks, curls, and a desire to dress pretty again. It was fun to watch Gabriel’s kisses turn Thea from a caterpillar to a butterfly.
If I keep adding sections/flowers to the bicone next to the top middle one, the five-petal design will make the whole think curve, forming a semi-circle -- and eventually turn around, making a complete circle, if I continue in the same direction.

Have any of you ever run a marathon? The modern marathon is based on the exploits of a Greek soldier named Pheidippides who rapidly traversed over twenty-six miles from a town called Marathon to Athens to tell his superiors of a victorious battle in 490 B.C. As he completed his historic run, he stumbled forward, and managed to yell “Niki”, which in ancient Greek means “victory”, before collapsing and dying. I’m not sure, but I think he meant to say Nike. He ran the entire distance barefoot, but might have survived if he hadn’t forgotten his new pair of comfortable Nike running shoes.

Lawyer Dushyant Dave led the pack. After the obligatory reference to the ‘unfortunate’ victims of the Godhra train burning by the Muslim miscreants(murderers, is the proper appellation) he launched into a tirade, accusing the authors of the SIT report which saw no prosecutable evidence against Shri Modi, for lying and worse. Siddharth Varadarajan, after a cautious opening statement stating that he stands corrected since he had not read the entire report, damned it as a shoddy piece of work. Interestingly, he too like lawyer Dave, was offended that the Gujarat prosecutors of those who were responsible for the killing of the Muslims, were RSS and members of the VHP (Vishwa Hindu Parishad)! The implication was that they could not be impartial in their enquiry.

In any case, while I feel compelled to point out the obvious—that a high-tech labyrinth of artificial caves dug beneath the rocky hills of an over-urbanized tropical archipelago is an incredible setting for future films, novels, and computer games—I should also mention, more prosaically, that Hong Kong's impending subterranean expansion will doubtless offer many lessons relevant to cities elsewhere, as public-private underground partnerships increase in both number and frequency, with space-starved global mega-cities turning to partial self-burial as a volumetric infrastructural solution to the lack of available surface area.

It's certainly possible to read a lot of Cronenberg's prevalent themes into Fast Company, most notably the intersection of man and technology and the betrayals of corporate America. However, I think it misses the point to a certain extent. This is Cronenberg working in established drive-in fodder territory for the first and only time in his career. He sticks pretty cleanly to the rules by providing a story with clear heroes and villains, plus the requisite amounts of sex and action. William Smith plays Lonnie "Lucky Man" Johnson, a race car driver in his twilight, doing the drag race circuit under the sponsorship of FastCo Oil. When FastCo betrays him (through their corporate liaison Phil Adamson, played by John Saxon), he strikes out on his own. Adamson uses every trick in his book to make sure Lonnie's cars never reach the finish line. Fast Company is slow-moving (ironically) and takes forever to get around to its central conflict. Cronenberg really only breaks out of the mold during a surprisingly brutal climax that kills off two characters and seriously injures a third.

That’s why “Hannah Montana” and “High School Musical” have combined to sell billions of dollars in merchandise, and why “Cars” — a product of Disney’s purchase of Pixar — is getting its own section at Disney’s California Adventure theme park.

I tried a couple of recipes from the book and everything turned out great. Below is an antipasti recipe by Carluccio (used with permission) which completely took me by surprise. The husband had been nagging me to make pickled onions and I ended up making something much more glamorous and tastier than that. These sweet and sour baby onions in balsamic vinegar is perfect as a starter at a party or a side dish to any meal. Try and have it the very same day its made and you will love it even more. I have reduced the quantities to suit the two of us and used small red onions instead of the white variety which is not readily available here.

This may sound idyllic, but it wasn’t all the time. One of the least attractive aspects of living at Hampton Haze was that the older children had to walk down a long, muddy, rutted track to pick up their school lift in the valley, and return the same way at night. And on playgroup days I had to do the same with a toddler at my side and a baby on my back.
We were walking on the beach with this mahatma and he spoke very little or no English. It appeared that he wanted to go into the ocean. He then began to undress and I heard in my head, hold these. I didn’t believe what was happening. The mahatma looked at me and shoved his clothes into my arms. I was stunned. We watched the “holy man” go into the water and submerge himself under a wave. When he came out, he put on his clothes and began to walk with us. Now the next part is very strange, but I know what I saw and I’m not making this up. As we were walking, the mahatma was suddenly gone. He was 50 yards farther down the beach. The other people whot I was with were shocked, too! This man clearly demonstrated occult power by using mental telepathy and bi-locating. He had power, but as you have read throughout the pages in the book, I believe that that power was demonic in nature and was given to him by a diabolical source.
Seriously though- isn't that true? People really DO dumb, thoughtless, even mean things. How hard is it to believe in right and wrong and not judge them? I think it is REALLY hard, especially because I have strong beliefs.
I hit the brakes a little too hard and almost flew out the windshield. I’m going to have to tap the brakes a little softer next time. I looked down the ramp and saw him riding down to the river and I guess I had to follow him. Nuts!
+Thanks to FIT I've been volunteering at some small shows lately! Saturday morning I volunteered for a designer on the rise, Loris Diran. It was so much fun even if my job was setting up the room where the show was at at the Bowery Hotel. His collection was a very sophisticated wearable look, I loved a lot of it. It was just such a great experience seeing everything behind the scenes!

I have also learned that there's a lot of public expectations and stigma around pregnant women. As pregnant women, we are supposed to be happy, glowing and delighted in the fact that we are bringing life into the world. These societal pressures only add to the guilt we feel when we aren't exactly feeling the way we're "supposed" to be feeling. There is also a stigma around the emotions a woman feels while she's pregnant. Her feelings are often dismissed as "regular" pregnancy hormones. Such misconceptions can lead to more depression and increased isolation.
I choose to be a faithful steward in GOD’s house! The zeal of my Father’s house has consumed me; it burns within me and causes me not only to desire but also to do His good pleasure.

On occasion, Jack Parker, one of the two winningest active coaches in college hockey (the other, fittingly enough being Jerry York, the coach of the much despised Boston College Eagles), who also serves as BU’s Executive Director of Athletics can be seen sitting close to the sideline of a basketball game, enjoying a Diet Coke and paying more attention to his phone than what’s happening on the court.
Not really. People ask me what my favorite comic is that I have created and since I'm very critical of myself and my work it's hard to say if I have a favorite. I guess Little Lost Yeti is one of my favorites right now as well as It Came From The Sea and Then Went Back Again.

At least no poor bugger had to climb into the mashtun and shovel it all out.

Although for years my wife, Carrie, has attributed the disappearance of small things such as keys, wallets, or cell phones to my age and general forgetfulness, a description against which I have no defense, I do believe introducing a child into the equation has both changed the playing field and relieved some of the burden of my guilt. I may still be old and forgetful, but now there's a mysterious force at play lifting and depositing things into various boxes, shelves, and corners of our house.
From the get-go, THE HERO'S GUIDE TO SAVING YOUR KINGDOM separates itself from the rest of the pack thanks to author Christopher Healy's clear, unique storytelling abilities. HERO'S GUIDE is crammed with action, adventure, excitement, and mayhem, not to mention littered with hilarity. The book features an omniscient narrator who foreshadows and explains in a way sure to catch a reader's interest. At times, I envisioned the voice to be the narrator from Disney's WINNIE THE POOH; at other times, I imagined the Narrator from the fairy tale musical INTO THE WOODS. Every chapter heading cleverly begins with something about Prince Charming, but you never which Prince Charming is being mentioned. That's sort of the point, though, because the four princes in HERO'S GUIDE aren't named Prince Charming, even though bards have demoted them to such roles in their own tales.
I do love being a writer and hopefully I can post some exciting news about 'The White Cuckoo' very soon on a brand new blog. This will be my last post on this blog, but I hope some of my old friends will join me, along with some new ones I have made along the way.
First I put the paper I was stamping on down, then the paper mask over the area I wanted to look like snow on the ground, then rubber stamped over it using Memento Black. I made sure that the ground part of the image stamped onto my mask, so when I moved the paper mask all that was left was my rubber stamped image missing the ground area of the artwork. I used a sponge dauber and Memento "London Fog" gray ink pad and gently applied ink in an upward motion over my paper mask. I moved the paper mask to a different spot and repeated the ink application with the sponge.

Earlier this year a coworker and I were discussing our children. She smiled and made the comment that I was in, what she liked to call, The Golden Age of Parenting. It is that brief time in life where the kids are old enough to govern themselves, feed/bathe/entertain themselves for periods of time, yet still unable to drive and are safe within the confines of the parental home.
A number of the older leaders of the Club such as Owen McGivern (later an Appellate Division Judge) and Joe Maggio, the President, met with Jim to suggest that he was too young for such responsibilities, particularly in light of the difficulties the Club would be facing with the defeat of DeSapio, the rise of the reform movement and the exodus of the Irish from the neighborhood. Jim McManus however spurned their suggestion of a compromise in which there would be older interim leader firm knowing that he controlled 41 of the 80 County committee men who would have to elect the new district leader. “When you hold four aces you don’t have to negotiate” he reportedly told Judge McGivern, and young Jim succeeded to his father’s position as the district leader and head of the Club.

Racist and dumb, Old San Francisco is the kind of silent film we fans prefer not to mention when defending the appeal of the form to skeptics. It stars Dolores Costello as Delores; a radiant, passively Catholic, relentlessly bemused granddaughter of a Californian ranchero, Don Hernandez de Vasquez (Josef Swickard). Don Hernandez, we are told in the prologue, once defended his rancho from hordes of the gold-crazed with only his bravado and a sharp blade. Those days are over. Now, the old man has only one rickety servant and Delores to keep him company, and the greedy prospectors of 1849 have been replaced with a more refined breed of vulture. These ones wear suits, bulldoze mansions and buy judges. They want the old man’s land.

So, here is the most recent picture of me. I am definitely getting the bump now and it feels nice to actually look a little more pregnant rather than just feeling pregnant.

We already have a nursery that is painted perfectly for a little girl....Score! Don't have to make any changes there:)
For the last couple of weeks, I've been getting up early to walk. I go before Ande goes to work in the morning so I can get out while it's still cool out and before the kids get up. (Plus when Bubber, Bug, and Nans aren't here, I can't exactly leave Puckey and The Jib home alone)

The country’s economy is also facing a number of weaknesses, such as the dropping foreign investment and capital outflow. Foreign investment has fallen by 48 per cent last year. From 2007 to Sept 2009, Malaysian enterprises had invested RM102 billion abroad, which was 1.7 times of foreign investment received. The Ringgit exchange rate has also been continuously falling. All of these show that domestic and foreign enterprises are lack of confidence.

Really good enjoyable read, amusing and passionate at the same time. The amusing parts are the interactions between the pair and Drake when he is with his family when they start interfere with his life and try to work out what he is up to. The passionate parts where when Drake is trying to seduce Eloise and show her how good it would be if she became his mistress.

I became interesting in this subject after watching a TV show called Lost Families on UK’s ITV 1, a show trying to reunite parents and the children they had, had adopted. As I watched again and again, the same story was repeatedly coming up a young woman getting pregnant from the 1930′s to the 1970′s (ish) and being sent away in shame and disgrace or removing themselves to mother and baby homes, ran by Nuns to give birth alone, spend mere weeks with their children (who were desperately loved by their mothers in the majority of cases) and being put up for adoption often leading to years of guilt and heavy secrets for the mother.

This is another definitely making again soon dish. We all loved it.
The fact of the matter is that the United States was founded on Judeo-Christian principles. The heathens and atheists out there may not like that very much but that does not change the fact. At least in the beginning our laws were based on these principles and over the years society has determined which laws and morals we should live by.

The technological ways of lives is the last stage to completely unfurl technological civilization in a very phenomenal way which is, other than the direct use, the short run and long run impact of its uses for commercial purpose in the dominion of uninterrupted open highest form of capitalism with the supreme flavor and spirit of egalitarian. The direct use of technological innovation and technological know-how will be manifested primarily in the daily lives of the people, for example: the supply of electricity to the households which will bring immediate direct impact through its uses in the lives and living conditions of the households. The far reaching or long term impact in the lives and living conditions of the people from the direct application are not less important than those in the short-run or immediate impact but more important are those impacts in the short and long-run deriving from the application of technological innovation and technological know-how within realm of the uninterrupted open highest form of capitalism with the supreme flavor and spirit of egalitarian. So far discussed the hypothesis considers the most key long-term impact of the application of technological innovation and technological knowledge in the uninterrupted open highest form of capitalism with the supreme flavor and spirit of egalitarian is the perfect integration of division of labor between the owners and workers which will just completely open the bud to fill-in the leaves of both demand side supplying labor and land and supply sides supplying technology and liquid in the internal environment of the industry and factory. Notwithstanding the fact that the sooner the division of labor on questions of ownership over the means of production will begin to reduce the gap an alteration in the frame of mind, approach and attitude of both demand and supply side will begin to germinate to reflect over the period in the development of (1) relations of fraternity, (2) congenial environment, (3) great devotion, and (4) outstanding commitment between and among the owners and workers rotating round the means of production in the uninterrupted open highest form of capitalism with the supreme flavor and spirit of egalitarian.

Since we are talking about Commercial Insurance, we can name ours as “The Top 10 Questions To Ask When Purchasing Commercial Property Insurance; “The Top 20 Things You Must Know Before Purchasing Commercial Liability Insurance”, “-Workers Comp”, etc. etc. I’d recommend having a different report for each type of Insurance with a different landing page that captures first names & e-mails, which then sends them to a link to download the Free Report, & also since they are now in your sales funnel, you can send them a nice newsletter every month or quarter. It’s always smart to stay “top of mind” with your customers or soon to be customers.

The searing Florida sun climbs high into a cloudless sky. It’s already 10 a.m., and still Charlie Harrison has not appeared. Eager families and solitary middle-aged men with an ardent gleam in their eyes bustle about the Cedar Key Marina, lugging ice chests and fishing rods aboard all manner of seaworthy vessels, as we scan the glittering sea for our very tardy captain du jour. Long before Harrison’s boat comes into view, there is the sound: A buzz like a low-flying airplane — but louder — comes ripping across the glassy water. Harrison’s magnificent airboat roars up to the marina with every eye on it. A few of those families cast doubtful looks at their much-less-sexy hired fishing boats, as a white-haired and mustached man with squinting blue eyes climbs out and approaches us. We haven’t been stood up, we realize. We’ve been treated to a grand entrance.

I went into the kitchen and calmly stood there watching him. I picked up one of the books I had gotten from Amazon – How to Help Your Spouse Heal From Your Affair: A Compact Manual for the Unfaithful. It reinforced several things I was thinking – that he should not become defensive and yell, that he needs to think about my needs, that he should be sensitive to the fact that I want details, that an affair takes many forms, and that it can take years to overcome one (especially if it was never been dealt with). He was doing his best to make me feel crazy and like I was being unreasonable, but he couldn’t shake my quiet confidence that I had a right to ask these questions. And it was obviously driving him crazy that he couldn’t drive me crazy. Mr. Mess then made some comment that he doesn’t know what “this” (gesturing towards me) is all about. A few minutes later he grabbed a few things, said “Now you’re getting what you want” and left the house without giving me a chance to respond.

In business, “best practice” is the idea of finding a method or technique that consistently yields superior results and then using it as a benchmark.

“Please, Mom. Can you make it any darker in here?” asked one of my younger daughters as I settled her into bed to rest.

After praying for her I asked if there was anything else I could do. Then she said something I never expected. “I would feel better if you would go away.”

I’m not usually one to be so forthcoming. I’ve been blogging on and off for a decade – i’ve seen the raise and fall of traffic, the waxing and waning of interest. All the while I’ve played it cool. There’s nothing worse than some whiny prick begging for attention on his blog. I’m making the exception here though, because i think that ‘The Curious Adventures of Lord Fuckington’ is worth the possible backlash.

Anyway, that’s the basic information itself, which obviously isn’t fun. But on top of it, the news came to me from D&U themselves, which tells you right there that just GETTING the update was even LESS fun. Because I think I’ve just discovered ANOTHER down side to the whole Earth Online situation – the two of them decided to deliver this little tidbit to me IN TELLS while I was ON THE GAME. Which, first of all, that’s supposed to be my down time, to relax. Second of all, there are actually OFFICIAL CHANNELS they could use to report things, which would not involve intruding on the aforementioned down time, and, you know, distracting me with WTF news while I’m trying not to die to an elite. And then, just to finish off, the pickle on the crap sandwich of the whole situation if you will, the TWO of them decided they were going to deliver the news by BOTH getting into whispers with me, INDIVIDUALLY, at the SAME TIME.

Back to my "detox week" Weight Watchers suggests for an extra boost for weight loss you can stick to 26 ProPoints for the whole week and no weeklies. For those of you who are not familiar with the diet club's plan I'll give you a quick break down. Every member gets a daily ProPoints (PointsPlus in US) allowance and the lowest you can have is 26 (which is what I am on) and then every member gets an additional 49 weekly PPs to use as they wish. You can only use your daily PPs that day - you use or lose them - but as many of your 49 on any given day in the week as you wish.

Prior to moving to California, I worked in a Career Services department at a business college. I thought for today’s post, and for all you job-seekers out there, why not release some of the career knowledge I have gained in how to proceed in a successful job hunt? Sure, I haven’t found a job yet, but I must be doing something right landing interviews in a city with one of the toughest, most competitive markets out there right now, so here goes:
In 1962 Gordon Law acquired a second-hand Bolex 8mm cine camera and suggested that Ian and his friends make a movie. Filming took place on Sundays in the garden of Ian’s home in Upminster, and in fields close to Barry White’s house in Wood End, Brentwood. The troupe consisted of Ian and his girlfriend Pat Few, Barry and Barbara White, Gordon and Ann Law, and Mike Price. At various points in the film Ian’s mimicry of silent movies legends such as Charlie Chaplin and Oliver Hardy is effortless.
Thanks for the interview guys! Any last words/wishes for our readers?

A writer of fiction couldn't come up with as much tragic irony as that which surrounded Christina's brief life. She was born on September 11, 2001 and she died on just as violent a day as the one in which she came into this troubled world.
Every time I see Joffrey, I just want to snicker. Jack Gleeson – who some might recognize from having played Gordon’s son in the blockbuster Batman Begins – plays petulant quite well. Robb is waging his war, Jaime is terrified of Robb’s wolf and Catelyn seems superfluous despite being sent on a mission for her son. Bran is trying to act a proper lord of Winterfell at the advanced age of what is he…eight I think? North of the Wall, Jon Snow and the Night’s Watch have arrived at Craster’s – Where does Martin get his characters from? I’m hoping not from true life examples in this case because Craster is a poor excuse for a human being. In King’s Landing a purge of Robert Baratheon’s bastards (suspected and actual) is occurring at the order of Joffrey (although many believe it’s at the word of Cersei until Tyrion revels to viewers that she really has lost control of her son completely). No doubt the slayings are the result, at least in part, of Stannis’ letter declaring to all and sundry that Joffrey and his siblings are in fact the children of Cersei and Jaime and therefore not Lannisters at all. A fact that viewers have known for a while, but the general public of the Seven Kingdoms is just now learning. As of this time, the only child of Robert to escape the purge is Gendry, who was a blacksmith’s apprentice and now travels north with Yoren and Arya. For his part, Stannis has thrown in with Lady Melisandre and her Lord of Light, a new religion that bears rather obvious similarities to Christianity and how it was first received in a largely polytheistic world.

A brand name or .com that is known for something can be quite valuable, even if the idea and concept did more work than the site itself. There are still plenty of words and url’s that can be sold on ‘pure potential’. If we have some good media coverage from when we launched, or throughout the journey this can really enhance the potential for the selling process. A market presence might also include a deep content trail. This could even be the accumulated words of a long running blog, listings on a classified site or any other form of crowd sourced content. Although we think that content should all be fresh to have value, the truth is some long term solid long tail content is often the hardest thing to build in a web business, and smart buyers know this.

As you can see, they did turn out great! They came out all cute and "foot"-ed, and they came off the parchment paper I had baked them on incredibly easily. The bottoms even looked perfect; they weren't hollow or cracking or anything. I do acknowledge that I need lots of practice with piping these though. The tops aren't perfectly smooth, as they should be. That could either be a result of my batter being slightly underbeaten (thus not allowing the tops to smooth out or settle on their own) or my own shoddy piping work. Either way, this was my very first attempt at macarons and my results far exceeded my expectations! They turned out delicious, with a nice delicate crunch on the outside and a soft, pillowy inside. And they're cute, too!

Just seeing this made me tear up a little inside. Even at its worst, I enjoyed this series and was sad to see it go. That said, I wish I had a super-huge version on this image – this is the only time most of these characters have been in colour, since the first anime made up an ending too early and thus missed the meat of the story, the second season was completely made up and only showed a relatively small portion of the cast, the OADs barely did anything to add to it aside from actually animating some of the Mundus Magicus arc and showing the end of the Mahora Festival arc, and the movie cut corners and only showed stills for most of the Mundus Magicus arc’s ending that it showed before going to original material. I wish it had gotten a full anime, but I digress.
I hope you had a good weekend and enjoyed the snow, those that had some.
Rajiv Chowk opens into the center of the tourist part of Delhi: Connaught Place/Square/Circle (depending who you ask). A round park rests in the middle of the neighborhood and avenues circle it like the paths of a planetary orbit, slowly expanding outwards. Streets are labeled “A” through “P” and finding your way around is as simple as knowing the english alphabet. High-End Indian shops (Fabindia, Cafe Coffee Day) and Higher-End Western shops (Adidas, Rolex, Apple) lay side by side for a fantastic shopping experience. Restaurants dot the spaces between luxury stores, but cater to all budgets. Walking just 2 blocks outside of the area and you are back in India’s Delhi with the bustling roads and noise, but even this area maintains the same sense of order that is embodied in Connaught.

The Obama FDS “already had issued decisions advancing more than 500 species toward potential new protections under the Endangered Species Act.” Among the species selected for protection were 35 snails from Nevada’s Great Basin, 82 crawfish from the Southeast, 99 Hawaiian plants and “a motley cast of butterflies, birds, fish, beetles, frogs, lizards, mussels and more from every corner of the country.”
To the members of the Bhotke Young Men’s Society, Shushan Cats was no criminal. The criminal statutes held no validity for those to whom the law meant only authorized starvation, torture, death. Everything done to the Jews of Europe … everything done to these had been absolutely legal, sanctioned by legitimate courts whose judges sat in black robes and vetted each and every decree as binding, fair, in the public interest, legal. Under these circumstances, that Shushan Cats was a Jewish gangster not only could not be held against him, but was a matter for celebration. (pg 219) The novel is on the one had a mildly absurd and very funny crime novel. Kestin revels in the tropes of the crime novel, and virtually every chapter ends on a cliff-hanger, each one more ridiculous than the last. There are times when the tough-guy patter and dialogue is so hard-boiled as to recall the best of Raymond Chandler, although Kestin does invest his style with directness that can be as disconcerting as it is hilarious: “I thought: Let’s take this bullshit one turd at a time.” (pg 127)

While it’s easy to scoff at the notion that such a cliched 3 word phrase can define a subject as vast as art, it doesn’t necessarily make it any less true -in fact, to echo writer Richard Bach, “the simplest things are often the truest”. A cursory glance over various works of art across various cultures does, in fact, seem to indicate a penchant to reflect the aspirations of a society towards what was accepted to them as Divine.

S: I am an animal enthusiast. Animals are my number one passion. I love all animals and I am a VEGAN. Since 1970 I have primarily rescued and re-homed hundreds of cats. I have raised numerous orphaned kittens. In 1980 I rescued some ducks and geese and found them a safe haven in the country on a friend’s farm that had a huge pond. In 2001 I rescued and rehabilitated some baby squirrels, 5 fawns, several baby raccoons, 28 chickens and 4 roosters. In 2002 I began rescuing goats in addition to the cats. I've raised several orphaned baby goats too. In 2006 I rescued a sheep who went to my friend’s sanctuary to be with other sheep. My dream is to expand my rescue someday (soon, God willing) to save more farm animals. Cows, sheep, pigs, donkeys, horses etc.

Scientists experimented on zombierats, and discovered that they weren’t technically dead. Their bodies still functioned normally; the rats still slept and mated and peed as usual. It was the brains that were different – the parietal lobe looked like someone had chewed it up and spit it back out. The doctors ran numerous tests and realized that a totally dead rat never turned into a zombie. It was the practically dead ones – the ones who still had a sliver of life left, even though there was no mortal way to save them – who suddenly developed a taste for brains. It was all thanks to a mutant protein called the Undead Prion (UP), which moved into a dying brain and made itself at home.

I am so happy there has been a change when it comes to the titles! If I Die makes perfect sense, and I'll remember which book it is, but I'm always having to look up the others when I want to talk about them, because I can never remember whether it's MSTTake, Save, Keep or Steal. So I'm liking the chnge! I also love the cover - I love all the UK covers for this series - but it doesn't link to the story whatsoever that I can see, I have no idea of the significance of the dragonfly. So for this book, I think the US cover says a lot more about the story, it really works.

A slight disappointment on Saturday (apart from Ballabriggs) was Samir Nasri who has hardly impressed me all season. On a scale of 0 to Cristina Pedroche (look her up), Nasri’s excitability rating scored relatively low when on the ball. His creative output can be summed up in three actions: hold the ball for two seconds, look around, then a simple 5-yard pass to feet. EVERY. TIME. I mean, that’s pretty much what I do. Not great.

The motivation for using assignment operators is threefold. First, the program statment becomes easier to write because what appears on the left side of the operator does not have to be repeated on teh right side. Second, the resulting expression is usually easier to read. Third, the use of these operators can result in programs that execute more quickly because the compiler can sometimes generate less code to evaluate an expression.
(I should add. . . I did my own thing when it came to interior pockets. While the tutorial is sufficient, I tend to prefer more and different types of pockets. So if you are using this tutorial and wondering where the clips and such are. . . well, that was just something I added in on my own)

We should follow Jesus’ command and stop sinning. Of course no one is perfect and we all sin but because Jesus is in believers then we have Jesus’ help. If you have accepted Christ as your savior and repented of your sins then you are free from your sins because of Christ, and we shouldn’t take that as a license to sin. Paul says that we are dead to our sins and alive in Christ (Romans 5:20-21 & Romans 6:1-3). We should be dead to our sins and alive in Christ, we should trust in Him as our savior.
Right now my house is filled with the aroma of turkey and all the fixings. I love that smell. To me that smell represents family and thankfulness :) I have alot to be thankful for this year. I have a wonderful family and even though we are spread apart and some live in Canada, New Jersey, Oregon, New Hampshire and many other places I am thankful for each and every one of them. I am thankful for a place to live, food to eat, a car to drive, my health, my families health and many many other things. But I think the thing I am most thankful for is my freedom. Not only for the freedom I have because of the many soldiers that sacrifice their lives on a daily basis, but also the freedom I have because of the sacrifice that my Saviour Jesus Christ made so long ago! It is because of him I live free!
No matter how you want to look at this country, its an interesting one. Everyday we realize that things are not as we thought they were. I just read recently somewhere online that there is a thought that the Druids came over to America and intermarried with the Natives here.Sorry - I have no idea where I read that and I should have bookmarked it. It said that the Druids and natives in South Dakota became the Lakota. Im sure the Lakota would have something to say about this - and you cant believe everything you read online - but the fact that the Vikings were here long before Columbus was but a myth not too long ago. We pretty much know they were in fact here wandering around and probably intermarrying with the natives.So who knows......maybe the Druids DID come over and have been here a long time. That would be very exciting. They had to go somewhere, now, didnt they, since Cesar insisted on exterminating them. (Those Romans ........)! I guess what Im trying to say is that this has always been a country of immigrants. Even the native people who were here thousands of years before the white man, came from somewhere else. And who knows who or what was here before them.

In a shit attempt to curb road deaths, S’Bu Ndebele ordered the JMPD (and other road agencies) to confiscate peoples licenes if they were arrested for any traffic offenses across the festive season. After having a number of senior legal people both in the Dept. of Transport, political parties and others tell him it was illegal, he sorta forgot about this idea. He sadly forgot to tell the fat fuckers called JMPD. So a number of people have no license as a result of them being dumb as shit and not checking the laws.As an aside, please be aware that only the courts have the power to cancel or suspend your license. You have the right to have legal council present and to defend yourself againt the piggies.

Another thing that was on TV last night that would be seriously funny if it weren't so serious: the Iowa Republican Caucus. The most vile of an upleasant group - Rick Santorum - was a co-winner. Watching this gang fall all over each other has certainly been entertaining but the thought that any of them being in a position to lead this country is scary. As far as I'm concerned, every fair-minded person needs to re-double their commitment to making sure President Obama has the opportunity to continue in that capacity. I certainly can't speak for anyone else, but I'm already getting involved and I look forward to the opportunity at hand.
Recently the tragic shooting of Trayvon Martin has unleashed massive protests across the U.S. that is a reminder of the Civil Rights movements of the 1960s. Racism is alive and well in America and people are making it known that justice needs to prevail here. The OWS movement will likely be out in force this month, even though the above legislation makes it much more difficult for them to launch their protests. Mars in Virgo has been an assist to activists and reminds us of the 60s Pluto/ Uranus conjunction in Virgo. Media coverage of OWS has been pathetically small. Back in 2003, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators against going to war in Iraq were out in major cities in the U.S. and throughout Europe. The media stayed away from these impressive protests and showed all of us how little free press is left in the U.S. that is not controlled by the corporations, especially those that benefit from war. Now we know that the Iraq war was a tragedy; both illegal and immoral on all counts. By June, Uranus will achieve an exact square (conflict) with Pluto that will be in effect through early 2016. I do not believe the protesters will go away.

I trust that the majority, informed or otherwise in their analysis of such things, has by now realized that films are more than just a series of images upon a screen. Cinema’s artistic ability to invoke myriad emotions gives it a unique purpose for some, and the very deliberate choices of musical accompaniments that help achieve the desired emotive ends have interested me for some time. In conjunction with (or indeed in the absence of) any other creative device, backing music informs us how we should be feeling at any one time. It indicates the way the director wants us to be feeling at that moment at any rate.
The venue itself was a challenge, being just a shell it couldn’t provide us with the power and internet requirements we needed so it meant power generators being hired in and a line of sight internet connection being ordered and beamed to us across the Berlin skyline from 1.5 miles away.

If there is any truth in the theory that a first earth age existed on Planet Earth, long before our current one began, then I’m afraid mankind has wasted a considerable amount of time and money digging around all corners of the earth for answers. Maybe the time has arrived that we should stop the internal strife, back-stabbing, and squabbling among us, and concentrate on our present (current age) and forget about probing into the ancient past, for the more we do so, the more questions we generate -- and the more bewildered we become.

Park Gae In and Jeon Jin Ho. What an onscreen pair! Overall, I really love their interactions. There were a lot of sweet moments (though i would prefer that they’d remove “some”). It never failed to make each PT fan happy. I learned to love Gae In’s forecast, the insight of what she feels made me understand her more. The relationship was founded by friendship that even if there are misunderstandings, they knew each other well enough to straighten things and that they really make each other happy despite the hurt. I love the fact that there bonding moments are typical of what couples do making it more real and something all viewers can relate to and wish for.

We finally got to do some Tot School this week. On Tuesdays, Monkey See has ballet and tap so Monkey Do and I get to spend a lot of quality time together. We've been playing, reading, singing, and dancing. She has become quite the little talker, when she doesn't have her pacifier in her mouth. She has a very indepth conversation with me that only she understands. It's funny, because she uses very serious expressions.

Last night after our busy day, I put Bean to bed and soon after, she began coughing (she's had a cold this week) and didn't stop for awhile. I went back to her room and had her sip water and breathe in and out slowly as I sat on the edge of her bed, reassuring her that everything was okay, and she was fine, and not to worry. When she stopped coughing, I thought to leave the room and go back to folding laundry. But then I stopped and thought about the Mom I want to be sure my precious daughter knows and remembers, and I turned back and lay down beside her, something I haven't done in a few months, and rubbed her back and stroked her hair and kissed her forehead and told her how beautiful she is, and how much I love her. I could feel her relax into me and just ... rest.
Hi sweet friends, hope you're all well and looking forward to nice weather. Here in the Finger Lakes we're still betwixt and between, 80 degrees one day and plowable snow 48 hours later, sheesh!

I have read and re-read this bookazine time and time again. There is so much inspiration within the pages, it's hard to put it down!
I need to read more Kit Whitfield, clearly. I’ve mentioned before that my favorite writers think things through and have a knack for detail, like Michael Chabon and Jacqueline Carey. Whitfield has this in spades. Her worldbuilding is flawless—for instance, while the deepsmen look more or less like your traditional merfolk, the hybrids have bifurcated tails that function like legs, although the now sickly royal families can barely carry their weight… hence canes, which can only be used by the royal hybrids. I actually bookmarked this article at io9 about how mermaids would view the world underwater for a possible project, and Whitfield nails every one of them—the lung capacity, the sheer loudness of their voices, and the eyesight. Not to mention the political implications that hybrids pose; while bastards are usually killed by royal families anxious to keep the succession clean, they can also take thrones for their own. It’s fascinating but, most importantly, unobtrusive—Whitfield never derails the plot to infodump about her fascinating world, which must have been tempting. She leaves you wanting more.
However, some unfortunate circumstances led to them finding out about my adamant atheism, and they promptly fired me via email, with no notice.

Don’t get me wrong – the number sounds a bit odd, like it’s not real. It doesn’t seem quite right. It seems like life hit the accelerator about 11 years ago and started flipping calendar pages with reckless abandon.
I made a series of cards for this challenge. I was inspired the Cricut American Alphabet Cart that comes pre-installed on the E2. I just love all the images on this cart. The images are super adorable and easy to layer. I just couldn't decide which one to cut! Even the scallop behind the die cuts is a blackout of a doily on the cart.

Here is where Levi would interject and say that I should have stood my ground. I am the adult and they are the children. I agree with him in that that is what a normal completely composed mother should do. I am not normal and almost never composed when at Target with my children. I think the automatic door sensor gives your children special powers over you upon entrance to the store and removes all logic and reason from your brain making you do things you shouldn't.
So at this point, I dont know what I'm going to do.
I used some fun patterned paper that I had in my stash, added a punched border, some gingham ribbon, a matching button and then matted up my stamped image that I had stamped on Flourishes Classic White and colored with Copic Markers. I only needed a few markers because the colored portions of this image are so small -- no real need to layer color! I used R27, R29, B41, B000, B0000, and then some of the Flesh Tones to color skin and hair. The shading on the bottom was done with the Tonal Neutrals. And that, my friends, is it! Easy Peasy!

It turned out he had lost his boat that he’d been sailing. I offered to make him another but the tears flowed again freely. It had to be that boat or nothing. So I went to look among the reeds where he pointed but it wasn’t there. Undaunted I went further down the embankment and I finally saw a little papyrus boat stuck in the reeds. I plucked it out of the water and took it back to him, hoping it was his boat. It was. He was so grateful he gave me his yo-yo in exchange, before I could protest. I don’t know what to do with this toy. I have never played with one before and the technique is unfamiliar to me. I gave it a tentative whirl and smacked myself on my head. I won’t be doing that again in a hurry. I decided to try to pass it off to some other urchin before long.
My holding cell mates when I left were: a chunky white man about 34 years old with an $11,000 bail – accrued, anecdotally, through things like fraud and other less glamorously violent charges – and no hope of posting after being there since Saturday and who was well versed at using a roll of toilet paper for a pillow and his jacket as a blanket/night-simulator; a mid-twenties black man transferring from Sandy Creek prison named Chris, who’s served 3-and-a-half years on an 16 year term for aggravated assault which, as he explained to me, “ain’t no small shit. You don’t even sniff parole until year eight man, ya dig me? Thass why I’m here paying it off, man, you got-ta pay it off else you’ll be in this motherfucker forever,” with “paying it off” a catch-all phrase for coming to terms with whatever shit you’ve got yourself in, a kind of karmic koan to help concentrate the necessarily fickle idiot winds of human consciousness into a relatively efficient force capable of dealing with court appointed lawyers and the ugly realities of the Brazos County Jail baloney sandwiches, and let me emphasize that Chris, with his rolling bass thunder of a voice and his impossible to understand pitch-oscillation, was a helluva pro bono adviser because he gave me an absolutely sterling mental tour of the surrounding incarceration industries; a Guatamalan man picked up for hitting another car and being Guatamalan, which is to say illegal immigrant – a fact confirmed for us by the Gautamalan whose only English words seemed to be “free?” while pointing at the collect call phone, “taxi driver” in explanation of his (illegal) occupation, and “deportation” in reference to his fate. The Gautamalan slept like a baby most of the time, a man deeply in touch with his destiny and completely serene with whatever was going to happen to him in the terribly strange country we call America.
Anyone wondering when I was actually going to get around to using my favorite flavor combination? I was. I usually associate orange and cardamom with the fall/winter holiday season and I started this blog shortly after the New Year. Last season I made orange and cardamom sugar cookies (they will be back), created chocolate orange brownies, and splashed cardamom in all my spiced breads, cakes, fruit pies and crumbles. Hence, the flavors were on my mind. It helps that I kind of think they are perfect together. Anyway, these blondies are my first foray of the year into the holiday flavor realm and they are awesome! I know I have been a little MIA lately- that would be due to my rather hectic work and school schedule. I have had very little time to cook, let alone anything worth remembering or posting. But, with the holidays upon us I am not going to have any excuses, even if it means late nights and early mornings to frost the cupcakes or salt the caramels :)

Dick Clark just passed away at 82 and early last night, as I lay in bed a few minutes before sleep overtook me, I felt a part of me ended.
It certainly is comprehensive. Within it's 900 plus pages there are over 1,100 entries from in excess of 160 contributors. From Abbey Beers to Zymurgy, it covers a vast range of beer related topics including the biology and chemistry of beer, breweries, beer styles and on and on and on. There are 30 entries on types of barley and even over 100 entries on hops that cover geneological lineages, growing habits and flavours. As Tom Collichio says in it's foreword, the aim of this book is "to provide an exhaustive account of not only beers history but it's science and art".

A Club Nintendo exclusive release. For 4,000 points Nintendo will send you a Club Nintendo exclusive WiiU disk. A disk containing all three Mother games. Nintendo would manufacture only 100,000-200,000 copies. Gamers who really want the game will need to earn the points. This means buying 20+ first party games over a few years and buying a WiiU Nintendo’s latest console. If Nintendo wanted they could even offer it for a thousand fewer points to drive more gamers to get enough points to purchase it. This distribution method would help Nintendo sell millions of copies of first party games.

For the last few decades, Democrats have taken the bows for being a party of “Compassion.” They claim their tendency to create and support government programs that are designed as short-term help for struggling Americans as their legacy of Compassion. Republicans were often portrayed as the grumpy old rich guys, too stingy to help anyone. The truth of the matter, as explained above, is that government programs do NOTHING to actually HELP struggling Americans find their way out of hardship. Instead, these programs pay Americans to do nothing. Just another government subsidy! Short-term assistance is available through most churches, synagogues, and many charitable organizations. Think what a load off our strapped government finances it would be if we each, as individuals, assumed the responsibility like those in the towns where the tornadoes hit, to HELP our neighbors get back on their feet. And, as a plus, we’d be following the guidance of Jesus.

Sounds exhausting doesn’t it? It is. But that’s what I mean about making a huge effort. The emails that I send using this method are a lot better than the ones I send without taking all that time. My first father receives emails that aren’t snarky (most of the time). If I have an issue, I’d rather tell him instead of forcing him to get it by the tone of my email (yes I know, I failed at this recently). He receives emails that are relatively typo free. They mostly make sense and are more coherent. If something doesn’t make sense to me, it’s not going to make sense to him so sometimes I have to add explanation to various things. I find that when I do this, there’s less chance for miscommunication. I’ve used this method off and on over the past year. I’m hoping that if I’m a bit more dedicated, maybe this time things will work out better. I need to stick to this plan. And take my newly learned lessons into account. I’m getting there.
See you there!
Topley Holland was the first man to cross the line. Others quickly followed. Another man was Colonel Jim Bowie. He was very sick and unable to cross the line on his own, so he called for help.

Backing Paper and Toppers
Over the past year, while attending trade shows all over the nation and in foreign countries, we have built a very extensive Rolodex with industry contacts. We have talked to so many publishers at home and abroad, and to so many agencies and movie producers that today we feel confident that our Literary Agency can make a serious difference for our authors...Most authors are not very good sales people, least of all when it comes to selling themselves. Therefore most books need an agent if and when an author seeks to find greener pastures for their book.
Once past these changes, I was struck by the film's fidelity to the book. They both have the very strong USP of the little girl who goes through a door in the wall of her parents' new apartment and finds an alternative mother and father in the one next door.
JOE: Fortunately, I actually do that crazy destructive stuff at work so don’t necessarily carry it with me into the real world. I also am blessed to have a wife and kids who not only support this crazy habit but keep me very grounded in reality. I DO have a tendency to study how things work, how people move and act, processes, how vehicles move, what nature behaves like. The best training for a VFX life is to LIVE life, watch and understand, appreciate the beauty of the physical world around us. Take acting lessons, travel, learn a musical instrument, draw or write (even if you think you can’t, it’s practice practice practice and perseverance that pays off). I also watch a lot of the best of what other artists do, many of whom I’ve had the honor of working with or even supervising, and appreciating how much incredible talent they have that I can only dream of.
Creatives, put one up in your office, and when someone bullshits you - just silently point to this poster. Clients, put this up in your meeting room, and when your agency is trying to explain why your product only appears for 2.5 fleeting seconds at the end of an ad, just lean back in your chair and nod towards the poster. Let it change your working life.
The family gathered quickly at the news of the lady’s death. They grieved and cried as they tried to discover what had happened. She was not sick, nor old, but the family knew of something else. She had gone to the village witchdoctor many times and when the witchdoctor professed Christ, the demons were expelled. They believed that the demons, in revenge, killed this lady.

After all the drama, this dress is kind of...meh. It's okay but I don't love it. Don't get me wrong, I will wear it because I didn't spend all that time hand stitching to just discard it.
At 7:30am, I wake up but stay in bed trying to find motivation to get up. I finally get up and decide to take a shower before the kids wake up. But the two little ones who moved into our bed last night (Violet at about 2am and Hunter at about 4am) wake up as soon as I move my warm body away from them. They love to cuddle which I love and hate at the same time. I know this time will pass and they won't want to cuddle with me anymore but I love my sleep too. Here is what the kids looked like when they woke up.

The arrival of Google’s new online tool Google Buzz is drawing a good deal of attention from technology watchers. Many are asking the same question asked by the blogger in this link: Is Google too late to market with this product? The questions raised by the Internet giant’s latest move are good fodder for discussion among executives. Google has traditionally relied on two components to help increase the use of its various Web tools: the strength of its brand and a zero-cost price tag.

Was AY approval premature?
The fact is that whenever I see successful people, no matter how friendly they are, or how much they try not to “talk shop,” or how kind they are in trying to involve me in the conversation, I never feel completely comfortable, for the simple reason that I am painfully aware that I am not their intellectual equal, nor have I, or can I hope to achieve anything like even a tiny fraction of what they have achieved, and this bothers me.
While waiting for China, we had many people warn us that our lives were going to change (as if we didn't know that!?) and they'd say it with a snicker, as if we'd signed up for this blindly... our lives have changed! Absolutely. Honestly, I worried about it a bit, because I loved life with Brad (and Scampy), but I'll tell you what... watching Jacob wrap his arms around Brad's neck and give his daddy kisses and watching him as he learns little life lessons (like being gentle with the dog) is worth the lack of sleep and moments of learning (and less movie and computer time)! Becoming parents has been a wonderful experience!
In all my homesickness and desire to go home - I know this much is true: I actually don't want to go home just yet. I have days when I feel incredibly lonely: but am not alone. And the thing is it's not people that can or will fill that gap and satisfy it well. It's only Him. I've been humming an old Easter camp song recently, not really aware that it's what I've been doing..... and last night before going to sleep I realized the phrase I was repeating was this:

I imagine that's part of the reason why happiness is hard to find. Instead of worrying about why it went away, or who was the one at fault for taking it away, or even the commonly sought after question: "When will I be happy again," he best way to learn happiness starts with one three letter word:
Nuts of all sorts, I especially love walnuts, sunflower seeds and sesame seeds
After escaping from the underground complex (and losing three personnel), the PCs and their squads returned home to Xudorn. Plans were set into motion to cordon-off the doors and set up a fort around the entrance. Forty tower-sites from the Ancient base to Xudorn are in varying degrees of scouting and building, to be used as a network of Aldis Lamp signals. Zeppelin-platform craft are in the works to be used as both aircraft carriers, as well as bombers. The first true aeroplanes are in production, leaving the ornithopters to be used as training and scout craft.
But are you so saintly, really? Do you do anything to make yourself happy that doesn't involve making anyone else happy? If the answer is yes, like buying yourself an iPhone for example... Well, congratulations, you are as selfish as the rest of us.
I like the red of the decor, and a wall of black and white prints - love it. I had a moment of "I wonder if that would work in my place..." Probably not though. I also had my brother take photos. Hm. Really hard to keep a straight face. Sometimes, really hard!

My beef with the way sex ed is taught, and I think that the proposed curriculum STILL doesn't do enough to address are the social and emotional implications of sexual activity. This includes thinking critically about the way sex is treated in institutions such as the media, religion, government and so on.

I can't believe it. In a few short weeks we will have survived deployment number 2. This has been an extremely long one and my husband's ship has made history for being on the longest naval deployment since WWII. As crazy and hard as it has been I am thankful for this journey. I've learned so much about myself over the past year and more than ever I have faith in the Lord and my marriage.

Batch parties are a great way to fill your freezer with lots of great healthy dishes for rushed evenings and nights when you have other things to worry about than dinner. In my house that is almost every night!!! Most dishes are prepared by just thawing and popping in the oven or on the grill for about 30 minutes while you heat up a bagged of steamed veggies in the microwave. The recipes all serve 6 and most can be split into 2 or more containers for smaller families or lighter eaters.

I used some red and blue decorative paper from my scrap bin (all of it is Bo Bunny) Add some red seam binding and a sparklet and almost done! I notched out not only the main image but the little sentiment strip as well, add some stitching and... ta da! Easy, peasy lemon squeezy!
Next, strain the water into a warm bath, add one-quarter cup salt (I prefer Sea Salt, but I digress), then soak in the tub for twenty minutes.

Normally I am not a frozen pizza girl. Don't get me wrong I love pizza but the frozen one's are usually pretty disappointing. I tried this pizza at my parents house and loved it. It had great flavors and the spinach and goat cheese were the perfect light combination. This is one frozen pizza I will be buying.

This is a holy week on both the Jewish and Christian calendars. And that makes it a good time to reflect on the Lamb of God who, if we will receive him, makes us acceptable to God. Jesus (Y'shua), claimed to be the once-and-for all Passover sacrifice who not only died but rose from the dead! Happy Pesach! And Happy Resurrection too!

We continue to see a bull market unfolding in the US stock indices from the Mar09 low at SPX 667. Primary I, of a five primary wave bull market, completed in May11 at SPX 1371. Primary II completed in Oct11 at SPX 1075. Primary III is currently underway. Within Primary III we are tracking five Major waves. Major wave 1 concluded in Oct11 at SPX 1293. Major wave 2 ended in Nov11 at SPX 1159. And, Major wave 3 probably concluded in Apr12 at SPX 1422. We state probably, because the SPX has not confirmed a Major wave 4 downtrend yet. When Major wave 4 does conclude we will still have a rising Major wave 5 ahead to end Primary wave III. Then a declining Primary wave IV will lead to a rising Primary wave V to end the bull market some time in 2013 within the SPX 1545-1586 range. This should be followed by a nasty 50% market decline into 2014/2016.

The box was amazingly heavy and while struggling with the masking tape, etc. to un-box it, I started to worry that I might sink to the floor after putting the vest on. I think it is 25 pounds. I’m 99% sure that you can remove weights from the vest to make it lighter, but I didn’t want to mess with all the pockets and weights, so just thought I would wear it as-is. After all, I’ve carried toddlers who weighed more than that, some distance, including walking across all of Disneyland carrying my granddaughter last month.
So please feel free to link up your posts - maybe it's a project you've completed that you're proud of - something you have wanted to get done for a while and need some extra motivation to get going on it - or you'd just like some of that fabulous encouragement, praise and motivation that bloggers are so good at spreading around.
I’m tired, I’m discouraged. But even though I want to do all those things, I haven’t.
Liam is pretty worthless as a protector. But what can he do, order his girlfriend around? No one would let him get away with that. Plus, his being so passive is probably what Hope and Bill like about him. He’s almost a blank slate they can write on. Maybe that’s why Hope and Bill don’t get along. Each one wants to mold Liam into who they want him to be. Steffy is the only one who seems to care what Liam thinks…when he does think. The problem is she cares too much and takes too much responsibility for Liam’s actions.

I also caught up on a lot of reading and writing!
I mentioned, above, some of the projects that various of us within the gateways, the RDN and Intute were involved in. Some of these had great potential but one or two seemed to be a waste of time. One of the most pointless exercises, IMHO, was something called Secondary Homepages in Mathematics. You can read about that project here. There were some other projects which I felt distracted us from developing in a relevant way, and these were usually related to enhancing the Internet resource catalogues which were unfortunately regarded as being at the core of the gateways, the RDN and Intute.
I'm afraid I once again have not very much new to show...or really nothing at all! I continue to blame work. And here I thought I'd be blaming things on black holes created by the Hadron Collider for years! So here is your re-hashed, re-boiled, and slightly re-formatted recap.
So long, posse, hope this post was more agreeable to you. If not, there's no hope, because I really did my best,
The growing conflict threatened relations between wolves and humans in the intermountain west. The animals had been hunted to near extinction early last century, after they reneged on an agreement not to wear sheep’s clothing. The state supreme court later ruled that arrangement invalid as part of a sweeping legalization of transvestism in the Gem State.

I had really high hopes for my vacation. I was going to get up early and work out every day, eat healthily, get a bunch of projects done, form meaningful relationships, and find a cure for male pattern baldness. But what did I actually do? Slept a lot, ate a lot, saw some movies (including Hugo in 3D, which was really good), hung out with friends, and cured male pattern baldness. So, it wasn't as productive as I'd hoped but it wasn't a total loss.

You spend half your working day flicking through the dictionary; “the good book”. You edit report after boring report and pretend to look up specialised jargon alternatives in the thesaurus. You are actually poring over rude words, testing your encyclopaedic knowledge of swears against Roget. You usually win; the man has no sense of imagination. You couldn’t if you invented such a complicated cross-referencing system.

Hey everyone ! Sorry about yesterday, but I was extremely exhausted. I was swamped with homework last night and I had to blog for English. School is getting harder and harder. I sincerely apologize. Today since I have just as much homework I'm just gonna share a winning with you quickly. This polish I won from Shaina over at Haute Lacquer, It's Klean Color Chunky Holo Fuchsia . I haven't decided what I'm going to layer it over. Swatches will be coming soon . Any suggestions ? Enjoy !
We then experienced further delays because we had decided to “personalise” the studio rather than just accept the off-the-shelf version. Hindsight is wonderful, but what we couldn’t have foreseen was that Mike would not be available for long periods – and without his input we couldn’t proceed. Still, at least during that time he managed to complete his PhD : yes, we do now have a doctor in the house!
What I want to say: Yes I am young AND 94% of my eggs are bad AND I have endometriosis. What is there not to worry about? (“Older” women get a lot of grief too I am sure) I feel like commenting on age either way is really dismissive and unhelpful.

Phew! Are you still here? If so, to sum up, I think everyone needs a first novel. Whether it's successful or not. Because regardless of what stage you are in with the writing game, you're going to have to face all of the emotional ups and downs that come with being brave enough to call yourself a writer.
If God is not willing that any should perish who is? John 1:4 states that in Christ was life; “and the life was the light of men.” Who is the god of death? John 8:44answers this. To the unbelievers Christ said, “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning.”
September 2 is the feastday of a County Kildare saint, Seanan of Laithrech-Briuin. Canon O'Hanlon begins his account with a lament that he is one of the many Irish saints of whom we know little, but he must have been a figure of some standing as he is named as an attendee at the Synod of Dromceat in 580. For this re-post I have added the details of the entry for the day from the Martyrology of Aengus which appear in the footnotes in the original volume. I have also added the details and accompanying illustration of the church ruins as this may be of interest to people living in the local area.

And now there's a threat of Scottish independence with the SNP in power in Scotland. Scotland is a massive left wing counter balance to the naturally right of centre England. Removing them from Westminster elections will further decrease the scope for success of left leaning parties in England, Wales and Northern Ireland only elections. Scottish independence is far from certain but if it happened it would make a realignment of British politics essential.The LibDems would be in an even stronger position if they had already made the move.

In Super Tuesday’s Ohio primary, Democrat Dennis Kucinich was defeated in his effort to retain his sixteen year seat in the House of Representatives. Ohioans have lost a great representative for their state, but his voice was one that represented all of us who are against war; represented all of us who are against the attacks by conservatives on the poor and middle-class and the government assistance that helps them.

Eventually, we made our way through the mall and headed towards the door we came in. Josh wanted to stop in a shop to look a little more before leaving. Michaela and I weren't much interested, so we went into a little boutique. I spotted some really neat shoes and bent down to take a closer look at them. Just about the time I did that Michaela says "Mommy, they want $112.00 for this dress! That's ridiculous!"

Another reason I was offering things for free on my blog is that I was trying to help people out financially………when I first moved to the States, I was teaching in a small Christian school and only making $14.000 a year (yes, you read that correctly)….there is absolutely NO WAY I would have been able to spend a lot of money on the great units being offered on TPT.

I like the surprises, the odd-ball repertoire they find and perform. This season it was a two-piano version of Gershwin’s “An American in Paris” and a fugue, arranged largely by BDDS co-founder and pianist Jeffrey Sykes, of a tango by Argentinian composer Astor Piazzolla. Both sizzled and seduced.

About a month ago, I was recruited to take a prestigious job much closer to home. I would no longer be working for a hospital but for a no-nonsense corporation with little patience for non-productive employees. It would have opened the door to other opportunities and I must say that the urgency with which I was pursued was something I found alluring. If I took the job, I'd have a two-mile commute instead of a 60-mile round-trip every day. I'd get no annoying calls on weekends or nights about cases that had to be done on call. I would have the title of director and I would have the autonomy and authority to call the shots. The woman who offered me the position told me she had to pinch herself when she interviewed me because she felt I was too good to be true. What was there to do except say yes?
Legends say there is a movie so over the top it has two women using martial arts on each other while riding a motorcycle. Finally finding the legendary Torque I managed to sit down and see if it was gloriously true. Well it was certainly over the top but that does not make it a good movie? Let’s rev the engine and see.

There is a fantastic website called Classics For Kids that we frequent at least once a week. They have weekly broadcasts that teach you about different composers. The broadcast is only 6 minutes long (not too long for littler ones) and they focus one one composer for an entire month. Along with the broadcast there is a little quiz for the kids to do while listening, and an activity page you can print.
It was 3 a.m. on Saturday, and somehow I found myself driving to see him. The roads are empty at 3 a.m., and those on the road are mostly going home, not heading from their warm beds out into the darkness. Not heading out to see someone for only a few short hours before they have to head back to work. But here I was, driving, overnight bag packed. No makeup. Wondering why I wasn’t in my pajamas, warm in my bed.

Another layer of my ignorance surrounds my mother carrying me in her tummy, the circumstances surrounding my conception, my gestation, my delivery, my foster care (for three days–I think), and more. My ignorance ends to some degree once my parents got me (when I was 7 days old). Then, they have memories and stories to tell of their own about the three of us; we started making memories together as a family. But in those days, they were taught that ignorance was bliss for them too. They knew little to nothing about nine months plus seven days of my life.
But just how far left has the House Democratic caucus moved? In the language of Mann and Ornstein, has the party edged from the 40-yard-line to the 25, or is it nearing the goal post? Despite the gleeful hand-wringing of conservatives – Fox News hyperventilated that Democrats “are clearly facing a terrifying reign of their own as liberal activists and unions keep hounding moderate members out of office” – this is hardly the Paris Commune. In a classic case of false equivalency, the media has decided that both parties must bear equal responsibility for the death of moderation. If the Republican party has veered to the right, Democrats must have made a similar swing to the left.

While most people were getting ready to fire up their bar-be-ques, drink copious amounts of alcohol, and set fire to colourful explosives in celebration of America’s freedom from the tyranny of British rule, I and thousands of others descended on the Wyndham Indianapolis West in Indiana for the very first Days of the Dead convention which boasted one of the most impressive guest lists this side of a Weekend of Horrors with genre luminaries such as Reggie Bannister and his wife Gigi, FX guru John Carl Buechler, P.J. Soles, Linnea Quigley, and Heather Langenkamp.
Gothic is also big; good news for Marcus Sedgwick, whose Raven Mysteries were being well promoted by Orion. And for followers of Neil Gaiman, whose book Coraline has just been released as a film in the US by the American film company Laika Entertainment, who seem to have found their niche, under UK producer Fiona Kenshole's vision, in animated movies with a Gothic flavour.
But just as babies are no longer content to wobble when they observe the rapid and graceful locomotion of their elders, the more I read the haiku of others, the humbler I became. Not just the classical greats, your Basho, your Issa: just scrolling through the latest issue of one of the modern haiku journals or visiting one of my favorite haiku blogs can leave me gaping: How do they do that? How do they contrive to crank the moon roof open and reveal the stars of a newly expanded universe with so few and such elegant motions? Sometimes I wonder if I’m actually writing in the same language as these people, or if they have discovered some kind of sleek, turbocharged English that can perform technical feats undreamt of by those of us who are still running version 1.0.

It brings a smile to my face when I hear of a woman with the tactile inclinations of a female gorilla. The latest addition to this redoubtable sorority is Bianca Revrenna, a 68-year-old “shop girl” with a penchant for slapping the buttocks of her male co-workers.
So tonight, after DH got home and put the girls to bed, he led me into our room and said Stay here! And he said he had a surprise.... so, I stayed put. A little while later, he came in and grabbed one of his ties and blindfolded me! YES... he blindfolded me!!! LOL He then proceeded to tell me to walk out to the dinner table while he took video.... (if I had known, I soooo would have changed! lol) Anyways, I get to the table, sit down, take off the blind fold and THERE in front of me was a NEW 17" screen Laptop!!!!! Seriously?!?! I couldn't believe it! Complete SHOCK! :D :D :D words can NOT express how excited I am! With my laptop being down, I haven't been able to scrap at ALL, and I have to go on his computer (downstairs), which, it's a super nice computer, I just don't get a lot of time on it, like I would a laptop. (not necessarily a bad thing....) Anyways, I was completely content on knowing that I probably wouldn't be getting a new laptop for a long while and even though disappointed, I knew at least I'd live and things could be worse, right?

Marilyn Monroe may be the most famous pop culture icon of all time. Though she was real and was on top of the entertainment world for a brief but pivotal period she has reached mythic status. The idea and images are as popular as she ever was. So for someone to play her on screen and not have it come across as an imitation yet a true to life portrayal is somewhat of a daunting task. Michelle Williams, on the outside, didn’t seem like the ideal choice to pull this off. She has since completely silenced any criticism that some may have been prepared to give. Williams delivers without question, one of the best performances of the year and greatly deserves the Oscar nomination she has received.

But there was no ill feeling or unpleasantness between them: Ralegh treated his prisoner as an honoured guest and wrote charming compliments of him which show his extraordinary power of detachment, in view of Berreo's treatment of Captain Whiddon-and even more inhuman treatment of others, as Ralegh quickly discovered. Yet he describes the suave and cultivated murderer that he had captured as 'a Gent, well descended ... very valiant and liberal ... of great assuredness and of a great heart'; and how he himself entertained him 'according to his estate and worth in all things I could, according to the small means I had'.

fast forward to november 18th… a group is going out to a hookah bar. my so-called best friend is going. we hang out. there are a couple new people to our group there i could do-without. even tell my so-called best friend this…but she continues to try to get me to engage with them. i am exhausted and dealing with weird people is not on my agenda for the night. we wrap the night up and as we are walking in the parking lot with the two weirdos….my so-called best friend says in her fakey public voice (which is kind of projecting) “so, heidi, what are your big plans for when you pass through the 200 pound gate?” huh? did you just announce to the parking lot and these two weirdos that i have been trying to avoid all night that i weigh more than 200 pounds????? oh. but it gets better. then, weirdo #1 says to me…”i used to weigh a lot and it took me a long time to stop shopping in the size large”….why is that significant? guess what i blogged about that very week? yep…. in my blog three days earlier i blogged about clothes shopping….kind of random for someone to start talking to me about when i my weight is brought up….so that means that at some point my so-called best friend shared my blog contents with this woman. i am assuming it was verbally at one point that evening…but whothefuckknowsanymore. so i laugh off the comments. get in my car. start to cry and quickly text my so-called best friend to not share my journey with new people. i cry all night. i am so upset that when m, who i was dating at the time, called me i had to tell her what happened. she was appalled. the next day i emailed my so-called best friend and asked her “on what planet is it ok to share another woman’s weight with total strangers?”. i say to her that she of all people knows how much i just want to be normal to new people and put this weight thing behind me…she knows this because she read my blog….she came back with some apology. she said she would not make excuses and went on to blame all the stresses in her life (and make excuses). she also said she just found out that she now weighs more than 200 pounds and blah blah blah finds me so inspiring. i told her to check her enmeshment issues and that her having to lose weight a little over 200 DOES NOT COMPARE to me having to lose weight starting at 373. she said she would do anything to repair our friendship. she said something at the time i did not understand and still do not…she said she would “reset” her brain to understand that what i share with her is not to be shared with anyone else. isn’t that common sense in an adult friendship? she even said that she has betrayed me many times and she was sorry for it. i forgave her. i did not blog about my heartache because i did not want to hurt her. i actually did not blog for two whole weeks after this incident. and when i finally did i only said: “there are some things i really want to explore but always feel like i need to catch-up before i just lay them out there....” again…i never did because i was sparing her feelings. afterall…she did apologize and say it would never happen again (ha!)

Rounding the corner, we have more shelving full of crap. FYI, if you are thinking of renting or buying a house, and in the basement there is lots of built-in shelving, it is not because the former owners are ever so handy or generous in providing storage. No, the shelving is there because that basement leaks and has water issues, and the shelving is so that their belongings don't get wet. Jut so you know.

There will be a sense of peace, that even if the externals that you are witnessing appear a little chaotic, that your internal reality is aligning with a deeper universal sense of unity, of connectedness; and of peace, of oneness. As that shifts within you, your external reality is immediately changing and shifting as well. No, you do not need to be tinkering out there. The tinkering, the work, is being done within.

Not only that but they support animal rights causes like their current xmas campaign to ban greyhound racing, so please do try to support them in their efforts whilst also smelling like you fell into a bathtub of beautiful fragrances!! :p
It doesn't look like I read much cause I also made and ate lunch (twice, I made an avocado egg salad that turned out terrible, and ended up eating Indian leftovers). Hopefully I'll have better news to report by my next update!
Oh yes, I am at it again! I have the best sponsors ever. (By the way, if you too would like to give me money to have a picture on my blog, click HERE for more info. I hear they make more money.)

sesame seeds, or mixing together a green salad, my mind automatically goes there. I contemplate what sort of challenge the dish I’m making could be for, how I would justify my choice to the judges, what I would say to defend my dish. Of course I’m not that creative when it comes to cooking challenges so more often than not, I start to think about a farmers market challenge, or “create a salad that can be considered an entire meal” or something ridiculous that would never actually be a challenge on Top Chef… how am I this big of a dork? Sometimes I just imagine that I’m having the judges over for dinner, and I wow them with my simple peasant style dishes. Seriously, nerd alert.
Once again the event was free to enter ! I don't know quite how Canterbury Council manages this - especially as they provide a generous show bag and icy cold drinks after the run. But all power to them - it's such a good way to encourage people to take part, enjoy some running, and discover what the Cooks River parklands have to offer.
This TV reader who four years ago admitted he felt tingling up his leg when the Great One spoke is still stirred to orgasmic fervor by the man – so much so that a profound lust seems the only explanation – unless Matthews is just a deranged, senile old liberal, but how could that be?

Wow. I can see exactly how God is speaking to me here. I can claim all day long to have faith in God for our future, but until my actions and deeds match, it does no good. I need to put my trust in Him truly and let that trust and faith overflow into how I live my life. Rather than wait and wonder “patiently,” I need to have faith and continue doing what He has called me to now.
2. BACKGROUND
So watch out. A destroyed educational system, a desiccated economy, and a debauched democracy are coming soon to a school district near you.
The original concept was that there would be a sequel, Hero Two!, where the hero, now living in the Riverland of South Australia battles another water creature, and finally Hero, Too, the third book in the trilogy, where a giant snake attacks his new home in the Clare Valley, but with the other two creatures (or their relatives) returning, and the Hero apparently giving up his life to save everyone, though he survives in case I wanted to do another one.
Those EDL members who say that 'the EDL should not concern itself with Israel' must be very naive - either that or tacitly or explicitly anti-Semitic. How can the EDL not support the only democracy in the Middle East? How can it not support a largely secular society which has a fantastic judicial system and a thriving economy? How can it not support a land and a people from which our own traditions and civilisation grew?

I don’t think the nations in South America and Central America necessarily want us to come down there and dictate which government they should have.

So I am now 1 month into my training program and I am really pleased with how everything is progressing. I feel faster and fitter, but I am starting to feel a little tired so I’m thinking about cutting back the effort on my non-running days, and maybe looking about burning around 3800 calories a week as a target. I will persist with 6 sessions a week though, for as long as I can.

Let me write a short story on how our believe systems were formed: Suppose there are 2 dogs, one dog is home God, and another street dog. Home dog was cared, loved and accepted, given a tender and loving affection, while the street dog was kicked, stoned, beaten, chased and shout at. So, one day the two dogs were together, and a loving little boy came to play with the two dogs, the street dog ran away and the home dog welcomed him and played with the little boy. This little short story shows that our believe systems are formed from what we have experienced in life – our family, our culture, our churches – churches where ‘people can be who they are and come just the way they are’ is modeled or religious and traditionalism churches, our schools and communities formed our believe systems. Overall if we live with our parents during childhood they could be the number one how it is formed, but schools, communities and all these things had a great effects as well.
"They take a drum kit and break it up among the three of them, and then they set up along the front of the stage. So, whoever is playing bass (James and James alternate between bass and guitar,) is also stepping on a kick drum…and whoever is playing guitar is also stepping on the high hat (and sometimes playing harmonica simultaneously). Heather, in the middle, switches between melodica, keys, glockenspiel and snare drum, often playing several at a time. And even with all this going on, their harmonies are astounding."

The trailer production process is pretty straight forward and works in a modular drag & drop method. It consists of a multitude of predefined templates like close up shots, medium shots, action shots, credentials, quotes, the release date and a lot more fun stuff. Gladly it also includes royalty free and suspenseful music, which facilitates the sharing process online.

Plenty of flash games to choose from. Your kids can also search and play their favorite cartoons online!

Based on sentiment and the duration of bull markets since 2000 I tend to see the current market as being very similar to the summer of 2006. 2006 saw a quick 8% correction that lasted one month from high to low. One month later the low was successfully retested and the market began to move higher again eventually taking out the May high in September. I suspect we could see something similar here. As I stated late last week I believe that 1300-1340 should provide a bottom for this correction. If this is an 8% correction as we saw in 2006 the S&P 500 would bottom at 1308.

The first half of the album seems to focus more on outright brutality - don't get me wrong, though, there are plenty of awesome melodic guitar solos - but the second half of A Perfect Absolution is where things really get interesting. The band starts mixing it up and adds a lot of jazz and progressive elements to their music, so all of the sudden you're faced with unpredictable rhythm changes, warm guitar interludes, lightning-fast shredding, dual vocal attacks, intense grooves, outer-space solos and even spoken word bits. All of these elements are masterfully combined like a giant puzzle, making for an extremely engaging and fascinating listen, as the songs move effortlessly from frantic whirlwinds of technical riffing to quieter moments that give you a chance to catch your breath.
more closely supervise the activity and work with them a little bit on it. I’m so glad that I got the chance to do that, and I video taped the activity to share it with you here! To prepare, I had copied the black and white version of the M and the Y pattern blocks and had volunteers glue them down on a large piece of construction paper. I also got the paper pattern blocks cut out. Luckily, we have a die cut machine with all of the different pattern blocks cut outs to make it a little easier to get them cut out, but in the past I have had parent volunteers cut out the blocks. I find that it works especially well to give this sort of thing to parents that want to help prepare things at home because they do not have time to help out during the day.

Needless to say within no time the message goes viral and that celebrity has got more followers than the entire population of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh put together faster than you can say twitter.

For those not quite in the know, the Black Death first struck England in 1348, after ravaging much of Europe and Asia. It is still regarded as the most devastating pandemic in human history. In England alone, an incredible 70% of the population is believed to have perished. It wasn't just the peasantry who were affected. Kings died in their palaces, bishops in their cathedrals, and barons in their manor houses. Entire towns and villages were left bare of life ... except for the overpopulous black rats, who spread the illness in the first place, and are still the stuff of nightmares as we picture them swarming triumphant over piles of human corpses.
I would highly recommend finding a conference that is affordable for you and go. I had a migraine for 2 days before the conference and then I was away from my kids for 2 days. By Sunday, I was woefully behind in everything in my life, but the time I spent with other writers was well worth it.

Marketers have an open window to what their consumer’s interests are. This removes the research that needs to be done to reveal what consumers are wanting and looking at. Pinterest has virtually allowed marketers to easy access to discover their target market’s needs.
It's pitifully piddly, this list, but at least some of Rolly's interior design met with the approval of the other guys and is there today. Yale Gracey fared better. The Davis-Coats-Atencio team loved Yale's stuff almost as much as Rolly did, and they continued to make good use of his talents, so Yale's special effects would be another point of continuity between the middle and final imagineering teams. Whatever else a Crump-Gracey house would have looked like, it would have had follow-you busts, the Leota effect, ghostly projections, changing portraits, and Pepper's Ghost.

I decided I would not succumb to despair or depression. I would not let the company crush me like an ant. The best revenge is success! I would take the cue and run with it, making my own opportunity out of what appeared to be a disaster for me. I knew I was too old and frankly, too experienced to likely find another similar job in my industry. I needed to stay in my city and I really had no other skills to turn into another kind of job, nor the time to develop them. I had to take that leap and go into business for myself.

sued R&DS for infringement of three patents covering hematology control technology, including U.S. Patent No. 6,200,500 (the ‘500 patent). Streck’s initial pleading alleged that R&DS infringed the patents without identifying the specific claims alleged, as is common in U.S. pleading practice. R&DS then asserted a broad declaratory judgment counterclaim, seeking a declaration that the asserted claims in the patents were not infringed and invalid. Such counterclaims are compulsory under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and commonly are asserted by defendants to gain leverage in the event that a plaintiff seeks to limit its infringement claim to specific claims in the asserted patents. Later, Streck and R&DS agreed that their litigation, although pending in Nebraska, would be governed by the Local Patent Rules adopted in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Those local rules require the patentee to make binding disclosures concerning the claims it actually contends are infringed. Under those rules, Streck identified 13 claims it contended were infringed, and later amended its disclosures to identify only nine claims. Nonetheless, R&DS sought a declaration of invalidity and noninfringement on all but one of the over eighty claims in the three patents-in-suit. When the district court declined to submit R&DS’ declaratory judgment claims to the jury, R&DS appealed to the

Here the speaker is born out of or separated from the deer, exposing them both, like the illusion that one can stay within the cute, within the deer fabric that has been fashioned and the speaker has been forced to carry. She has become that thing and separated. There is no skin that does not chafe, nothing in nature has a comfortable flesh to inhabit, from the grass that gets chewed to "seed flour" in the deer mouth to the geometric forms of the galaxy. The speaker finds only chafing, cutting, fluid leakage, and open sores, but the painful discomfort comes before the "time for the cutting to slowly start to heal."

I write under a pseudonym because I can, and because there are many bad people—especially of the kind exalted by PC—who would surely harm myself or my family if they could easily find us. I know enough about the internet and politics and history to realize that I will have no protection in the long term, even if I never write another word. I chose Tanstaafl because I believe what it stands for: There Ain’t No Such Thing As A Free Lunch. I value many such aphorisms, but I selected this one because it also has a name-like acronym.

Büyük Ada (literally meaning ‘Big Island’) is the biggest of the Princess Islands. I think it’s a good Sunday escape.

I feel so bad for him--he just seems not to be embracing this whole "I am my own dog, the lord of my house, dominant to all" thing. We do our best to keep him calm. Don't hover. Speak quietly and in that artificial squeaky voice that dogs love. Stroke him gently. Make him sit for his food and his treats, to let him know that he can rely on us, that we are actually in charge.
In the other case, authorities allege that Lester France, 44, of Rockwood abandoned six American bulldogs in a house where he previously lived in the 28200 block of Cahill in Flat Rock. On Sunday, a tip led police to the home, where they found the dogs placed in kennels without food or water.
I don’t know if I could pick just one! I love Dandelion Wine by Bradbury, but I also think American Gods by Neil Gaiman is pure magic. The Gargoyle by Andrew Davidson is one of the best newer books I’ve read in a long time, and Alan Bradley’s Flavia de Luce series is incredible.
I will try to find out more about this. Or maybe one of my blogger friends will... There is NO information about this anywhere so I'm not sure how they were going to let people know about it. At least they sent it to someone, although I'm know sure why me. I have not yet been to Roscoe's since moving here, but I've seen some good reviews of it since they remodeled the place.

So tonight I had the pleasure of unwinding with a bottle of saison Brett. I am very thankfull that I bought a few bottles of it to cellar, and one to drink now. This is mainly for the fact that only being cellared 3 months right out of the bottle and being 8.5 percent it is pretty boozey now. But a year or two will take that edge off nicely.
I went to a tasting of some of the Wine Society’s newest offerings last week. They had rather neglected the Languedoc, but they were showing a Cinsaut from Chile. I had no idea that Chile produced Cinsaut and this example was delicious, made by De Martino from thirty year old unirrigated bush vines in the Itata Valley, which is only about 20 kilometres from the coast, and therefore one of Chile’s cooler areas. The wine was fermented in amphora, which apparently is an old tradition in Chile.

Of course the media have immediately jumped to the only sensible conclusion and declared that the film must have captured a time traveller!!!! (not like them to sensationalise a story is it??!). But it has to be said, it is an odd bit of footage, that I find a little un-nerving to watch (especially in the clips now available when the woman in question has been 'zoomed in' and slowed down). Her mannerisms are completely consistent with those you see every minute of the day whilst walking down the road, and the 'grip' she has on the object is just like that of someone holding a mobile. Oh, and she is definitely talking into it too. The Walkie-Talkie wasn't invented until the 1940s, and transistor radios weren't around until the 1950s, so I have no idea what she could be talking into. Perhaps she was a bit cranky and just talking to herself? Perhaps she was holding the side of her face due to toothache and moving her jaw in pain? I don't know... I guess it's most likely she was a time traveler!
Without the voting support of church Israel’s well-established desire to see Iraq destroyed and its oil divided up resulted in the first gulf war in 1991 and the present contemplated devastation of Iran is nearly unstoppable. AIPAC and many American businessmen have profit interests in war and campaigned for new wars as a matter of business, but it is the Judeo-Christians who have provided the grassroots clout to keep the War On Islam churning.*
