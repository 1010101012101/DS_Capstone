Surprise City Council members have started what could be a years-long discussion about drafting a city charter.
An epic failure prevailed. The front office whiffed on all of its offseason moves. The players were all talk, and little action, as their own agendas carried more weight than the team, resulting in the most underachieving set of Blazers in 11 years. And McMillan, who entered the season saying he felt he would be fired if he didn't get to the second round of the playoffs, became so tight and so rigid that by Valentine's Day his team no longer wanted to listen to him or play for him.

RB Ahmad Bradshaw. That looked like a walk-through in practice when the Pats’ defenders just held up the blockers. It was also the oddest celebration of a Super Bowl-winning touchdown you’ll ever see. Yes, that was RG Chris Snee shrugging and then pointing to the ground as if to say, “He should’ve gotten down.” And how about Wilfork pumping his fist in celebration? Crazy. Anyway, long story short, if you score the game-winning touchdown, you get a game ball. Especially at the end of an impressive performance by a tough runner who fought through a painful foot issue this season.

Eric Alexander could play a more prominent role and the intriguing Sal Zizzo might be placed on the 18-man roster against Columbus. The speedy midfielder played 77minutes in the team's 3-1 win against Vancouver in a reserve league game April22 after recovering from knee surgery. His attacking style and pace could be what the Timbers need.

Crane's relatively brief stay in jail was among the elements of his past that came under scrutiny a day after he was accused of murdering Valley philanthropists Lawrence and Glenna Shapiro in their Paradise Valley home and setting the house on fire.
* One of the best "Grimm" moments so far: after watching her seduce and kill two men, Lena (Acker) drives to a park, and casts a cool, appraising look at the grassy field. A young man catches her eye for a fleeting second -- is he next? Then she wipes away her vampy red lipstick, gets out of the car and starts flirting with a rather plain-looking man. He responds, delightedly. Is he next? Then a young girl runs over and speaks to them: "Thanks, Dad. C'mon, Mom." Lovely bait-and-switch.
Air-control managers were replaced in New York, but the rules that sparked the complaints remain in place for Teeterboro and Detroit.
He loves to cook with those humble ingredients. Take carrots: Niche offers a dish that showcases them in three very different ways. He slices large carrots into thick strips and cooks them slowly in carrot juice, orange juice and spices, until they are tender yet still firm; he roasts baby carrots and tops them with fennel pollen; and he pickles stubby Thumbelina carrots, then tops them with dehydrated carrot-cake crumbs (the cake made from the pulp left when carrots are juiced), dehydrated pepper crumbs and dollops of house-made yogurt.

On Sunday morning, Berkman said, he woke up with the cold feeling in his throat, but it went away again. But after about a minute on the treadmill at his local gym, Berkman said the feeling returned and did not dissipate, and he had trouble breathing.

"I feel bad for him," Brad Stuart said. "He's worked hard to get back. I don't know what the severity of his injury is, but you've got to feel bad for the kid, he worked hard to get back and only lasted a couple of shifts. It's going to be a big loss for us, but we've got somebody else to step up for us."

The three-year-operation came to light in July 2009, with the arrests of more than 40 people, including three mayors, two legislators, five rabbis and dozens of public officials.
An updating of the old Muppets franchise that has the gang reuniting to put on a show and save their famous theater from demolition; when the show gets going, so does the film. Co-star (and co-writer) Jason Segel is a little heavy-handed on the wink-wink irony (and dumbed-down humor).

Others have found ways to work within the system. Bassem Youssef, a heart surgeon who tended to the wounded during the revolution, vaulted to fame when his homemade YouTube videos pointing out the foibles of those in power caught on in the months after the revolution. Soon he became a star, landing his own television show, "El Bernameg" (The Program) on an independent satellite station. Working with a staff of just four, Youssef has pulled off what is exceedingly rare in any Middle Eastern country — a satire program along the lines of "The Daily Show" that stands in sharp contrast to the party-line programs that populate state-run news stations. (In June, he will spend a few days at the Comedy Central series' New York set.) Bits on his show frequently lampoon pronouncements of SCAF or the Muslim Brotherhood by contrasting them with footage and facts from modern-day Egypt.

"While the rest of the economy was cratering, two elements of our economy really propped us up.

• Would center Tyson Chandler want another crack at the Heat? According to Mitch Lawrence of the New York Daily News, that's a big 'yes.': "Having played a major role in the Mavs’ title run, Chandler won’t be lacking for confidence if the Knicks finish seventh and play LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, even as they were swept, 3-0, in the regular season. But he also knows that his team would have to raise its game to pull off the upset... 'I definitely think the Heat are as good as they were last year,' said Chandler, who will return to action Wednesday against the Clippers at the Garden. 'The thing about them is, once they get rolling, it’s just hard to stop them. You’ve got to keep those guys contained. It can be done, I know. But it’s not easy to do.'”

And while most marathoners must take buses well before dawn to the starting line near Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park, those of us on wheels can enjoy a leisurely start in Carmel and reward ourselves with a Big Sur sunset, dinner and an overnight stay amid the big trees.

A Do the diagnostic fault codes specifically identify a failed catalytic converter? Unless the exhaust is restricted by a failed catalytic converter, I'd be inclined to replace just the oxygen sensors first -- particularly the front sensor. The original may be slow to react to changes in the percentage of oxygen in the exhaust and might not keep the fuel-air mixture as precise as it should. With a new sensor, the converter may be able to catalyze the smaller percentage of unburned fuel well enough to keep the engine light off. If not, you can always decide to replace the converter at a later date. If you do, consider an aftermarket converter at a significantly lower cost.

The story of Bodner’s life, which ended violently in 1982, is mostly anecdotal. Little documentation exists of his travails — including his basketball record — and his failures, which are legion.

Peter Goldmark put it well in his recent column for Newsday: "Our real problem isn't decline; it's paralysis. And the first step out of paralysis is to tell it like it is. But no one is doing that. ... Neither (presidential) candidate acts like someone seeking to build a broad public mandate for serious action.

All of the bills proposed in Congress this year contain some useful elements, but none would do enough, either for the climate or for the taxpayer. They typically have limits, which are much too low, on the allowable price on emissions -- keeping it at around $40 per ton or less in 2020, roughly half the level that is needed. And they typically distribute some money, but not enough, to households. The Cantwell-Collins bill comes closest to our recommendation, with a 75 percent refund, but according to our model, even that is not quite enough.

For Kanevsky, who was born in Kharkov, Ukraine, the path from obscure expat to sought-after artist has been a winding one. Soviet Russia was known for training generations of impeccable artisans in otherwise lost techniques to repair the devastation wreaked upon her monuments during World War II—Kanevsky is not among them. Instead he was an architecture student during the late 1960s, studying Modernism right at the end, as the movement gave way to Brutalism. After graduation he later lived in Leningrad for about 10 years, during which time he endured a sobering arrest by Soviet authorities for attending a private lecture on the history of Jews in Spain. Shortly thereafter, in 1989, he emigrated to the United States.

It's a sad sentiment I hear in my own country of Uganda: the idea that homosexuality is somehow un-African and foreign to our culture, an import of the West that must be stopped. But it is not African to restrict another's freedom. It is not African to spread lies and dissent and urge brutality against others. And it is certainly not African to deny fellow citizens basic human rights. No, these are ideas introduced and fostered by our colonizers, not by our ancestors.

There is no clear favorite to win the Oscar for Best Picture, but the most likely choice, "The Artist," is a feel-good, love-letter to Hollywood's past that stands out mostly because it is an honest-to-goodness silent movie.

I'm OK with that.

All you need to know about Konz was summed up by a letter he wrote to Badger fans explaining why he opted to leave school after his junior year for the NFL Draft. He has the kind of leadership mentality that teams look for in a center and is athletic enough to slip over to the guard spot, a huge bonus.

He had blood clots in both lungs in 2009, a sprained ankle that sidelined him for a bit in 2010 and a dislocated ankle that bothered him in 2011. He did not run or jump at the combine, but his body of work on tape is so good that it may not matter.

Mix the lamb and dill-rice together, and you get a union of opposites: the meaty lamb and the smack in the face of more fresh dill than you ever knew you wanted. Glorious.

Even the power of prayer has dissipated in his eyes. "In fact, I consider prayer to be of immense psychological benefit," he says. "But we must accept that its tangible results are often hard to see. When it comes to obtaining certain, direct results, it is clear that prayer cannot match the achievements of, for instance, modern science."
Although the U.S. government hasn't warned Americans to stay away, it has urged caution. On its website, www.travel.state.gov, the State Department says, "While millions of U.S. citizens safely visit Mexico each year, including thousands who cross the land border every day for study, tourism or business, increased levels of violence make it imperative that travelers understand the risks of travel to Mexico. . . . Common-sense precautions . . . can help ensure that travel to Mexico is safe and enjoyable."
The crackdown begins.

He said Sunday on CNN that during the period when delegate names had to be submitted, "I was driving around in a truck with a guy named Chuck in Iowa, you know, breathing through a swizzle stick and running a marathon."

Some bills get further because the sponsors head important committees or hold different positions of power. Others get more bills signed into law simply because they introduce a lot more. And still others get their bills to the governor’s desk because they face tough re-election battles and need to show constituents how hard they’re working.

Vonn said that it's possible that as the program grows, it will add boys to the mix, but for now, she and the rest of the instructors can see the impact of allowing girls to be on their own is having.
Mint Chocolate Pots de Creme, for example, are surprisingly simple. They satisfy the decadent chocolate requirement at holiday time, but incorporate a background of fresh mint to provide a more festive, seasonal bent. These baked puddings are served in individual ramekins - we found miniature glass coffee mugs that worked as well - so presentation is already taken care of. Plus, they can be done a day or two in advance.
The man in the truck was tearing down his barn, and in the process ripped up what he thought was a concrete floor only to discover the slabs were actually tombstones turned upside down. Thinking the museum might want the grave markers that date back to the mid-1800s, the man donated the tombstones to the museum.

My personal childhood recollections include Muny shows with big stars in them, such as Eddie Albert in "My Fair Lady," Pernell Roberts in "Camelot," Jerry Orbach in "Promises, Promises," and too many others to remember. I saw Richard Kiley (the "we spared no expense" tour narrator in Jurassic Park) reprise his famous Broadway role of The Man of La Mancha in 1970. That thrill was kind of diluted, though, because the only remaining tickets that night put us in the last row, right in front of the free seats!

Something about the sideline arrangement at Northwestern gave him reason for concern last week. He doesn't want to be a distraction to the point that players are constantly watching out for him as happened during a game against Purdue.
Quiñonez, 25, gambled with her life eight months ago by returning to her native Mexico. It was a frightening step she had to take so she eventually could live legally in the United States with her citizen husband, Juan Evangelista, and 2½-year-old son, Aidan. She went through nearly half a year of anguished waiting in Mexico. But she is now a green-card-carrying legal resident of the United States.

Rihanna has partied here, so it has instant street cred, right? In the space where SIX Lounge once set the agenda for Valley nightlife, Steve McDonald has opened an upscale, Western-chic spot for drinking and dancing. The club has a more open layout, and SIX's obsession with modern, minimalist chic is gone. Revolver is warm, inviting and done in a mix of creams, browns, coppers and beiges, like a swanky honky-tonk. But the biggest changes were knocking down the walls that made SIX a VIP club and a main club, and moving the DJ booth to a prominent tower that faces the entrance.

The best part of this is that, like with tobacco, it would be and entirely discretionary tax. Anyone and everyone can chose their level of participation, from all-in to not-at-all. It is also a fair tax because an individual's level of participation is likely to correspond to his or her level of need in regard to health care services. The food industry should have no issue with this for several reasons (although I'm sure they would fight it). First, there is the precedent of the tobacco industry, which has endured incomparable restrictions on advertising and sports sponsoring opportunities along with exorbitant taxes on its product, and yet continues to thrive. Also as with the tobacco industry, the additional taxes would be added on top of profit, not taken away from profit. And finally any argument that they will go out of business, close plants, close restaurants, lay off workers would be unfounded rhetoric. People will continue to eat fatty snacks and eat at fast-food restaurants. And in the spirit of the free market, if the demand for unhealthy food declines, the demand for healthy alternatives will increase. The corporate CEOs only need to decide on which side of the equation they want to position their business.
After AFI, the filmmaker had managed to sell a few pitches for low-budget indie movies, but had grown weary of the solitary and creatively constrained screenwriter's lifestyle.

A simpler and less expensive option began to gain traction in the early 2000s after influential lawyers, acting on the principle that individuals should be able to do what they want with their own money unless it's illegal or against public policy, moved to expand the concept of the trust to include pets and noncharitable purposes, Beyer said.

Watching the rest of the movie, though, is a bit like being poked in the eye yourself. Cheaply and flatly shot, oddly scored to snatches of classic rock, cast with a troupe of crummy kid actors, it’s less a movie than a playground assault.

CHECKING IN: The Orchard Garden's plain-Jane facade sits right on the curb of busy Bush Street (there's no pull-in valet area), so there's not much room--or time--for unloading. Fortunately, the bellhops are on the ball. Unloading from my taxi was seamless, and by glancing at a luggage tag on one of my bags, one of the bellhops was able to greet me by name by the time I reached the front desk half a minute later. After a quick payment confirmation, a clerk at the desk briefed me on the hotel's amenities, including free Wi-Fi, and offered a genuinely welcoming smile.

In 2010, however, white working-class voters backed Republican House candidates by a 30-point margin; the same showing in November would almost certainly doom the president, which explains why Obama is fighting to hold down Romney's margin.

The recent jump in oil has hit energy markets as the global economy gradually recovers from recession. Higher prices resulted in a surprise trade deficit last month in China and helped keep U.S. gas pump prices at the highest levels ever for this time of year. Retail gasoline slipped less than a penny on Friday to a national average of $3.54 per gallon, according to AAA, Wright Express and Oil Price Information Service. That's still nearly 41 cents per gallon higher than a month ago and 74 cents more than the same time last year.

* The tag team match between the teams of Jack Swagger and Dolph Ziggler and R-Truth and Kofi Kingston was all right but nothing special. Ziggler won by using dirty tactics and pinning Kingston, which was a nice throwback to their seemingly never-ending feud a few years back. It was surprising to see Kingston and R-Truth, who just scored a non-title victory over the tag team champions on Raw, lose in their second match as a team.
