Although Thais drive on the left, this is a loosely enforced rule, as people are constantly passing across even double yellow lines, causing us to stifle silent screams as cars speed toward us head-on in our lane.

I'm a fairly disciplined eater, but at SPQR I couldn't resist finishing the pinzimonio, a crudite plate with leaves of romaine, spears of cucumbers, slices of fennel and radishes fanned around a ramekin of salsa verde and a small pile of sea salt.

This one is mixed with thin slices of celery, potatoes, lemon and flakes of bottarga, dried and cured fish roe, which adds a pleasantly salty seafaring undercurrent. From there I spooned into the stracciatella, the Roman version of an egg drop soup, with a deeply flavored broth, lacy swirl of egg white and generous dusting of Parmesan cheese.

Pediatric surgeons typically treat the condition with a series of operations called the Fontan procedure, designed to enable the heart to function without the missing ventricle. The last operation involves implanting a synthetic blood vessel made of Gore-Tex to reroute blood from the lower extremities directly to the lungs instead of through the heart. The device works, but it is prone to clotting, infection and in some cases, the need for additional surgery later in life as the child grows. The idea behind Dr. Breuer's project is that a natural conduit with the biology of a normal blood vessel would grow with the child and avoid or significantly reduce complications associated with a synthetic tube.

It would be nice to say that this drill set the tone for the beginning of the Urban Legend era at Ohio State and that Miller proved to be a big hit of his own in the slinging, winging spread offense with which Meyer won two national titles at Florida.

She had taken a simple maple syrup recipe belonging to her grandmother, packaged it and turned it into a multimillion-dollar business known as Michele's Syrup. She didn't bother to consider Mrs. Butterworth or Aunt Jemima's presence on the shelf. Instead she put her own original mark on the product - by personalizing it with her own name on the label and using the recipe handed down by her grandmother.
He had arrived late, as was his custom, and rarely looked out at the small chamber lined with county directors, employees and others waiting to testify on agenda items. Then, minutes before the final gavel, he abruptly stood up and left the chamber.
That's a striking contrast to what happened in 2009 when the Pentagon conducted a photo-op flyover in lower Manhattan by a passenger jet and F-16 fighter. The sight of the aircraft flying past the Statue of Liberty and lower Manhattan's financial district set off a flood of 911 calls and sent office workers rushing into the streets in panic.

"Even though I will be discharged no one can take the title of Marine away from me," the post said. "...Today is just the start of the rest of my life. Semper Fi."
That's confusing. The U.S. Geological Survey lists 192 North Forks in Colorado. Not all of them are streams, as there's a North Fork Mine and a North Fork Dam and the like. But my own Chaffee County has 10 North Forks, most of which were new to me, like the North Fork of Middle Cottonwood Creek.
Patton said he did what he had to do.
Copper and its alloys are used in coins, computers, refrigerators and plumbing. The state produces more copper than the other 49 states combined and is one of the original 5 "C's" that have driven Arizona's economy.
According to some readings of both the McCain and the Lieberman bills, this may include sensitive personal information or generally protected free speech in emails. Further, many civil liberties advocates argue that intelligence agencies and military branches should have a limited role in securing domestic networks, such as providing information and expertise to civilian authorities and the private sector, and not be able to extensively monitor private communications or gather information from private companies that the intelligence agencies ordinarily would need court orders to receive.

Brady Quinn can't be blamed for being at least a little annoyed at the Tim Tebow phenomenon. In a recent GQ magazine article, the Denver Broncos backup quarterback had some seemingly harsh comments about the team's starter, including this one about Tebow's very public displays of his Christian faith.
"I feel as I let them down, I've apologized to them," said Terry, who will be absent from the final alongside another three Chelsea players to suspension. "Looking at the replay, it does look like a red card."
Added by lawmakers was an income tax credit for investors in small businesses in Ohio worth up to $100 million each biennium.

With Reds starter Johnny Cueto also gone after five innings and three runs, two on Jon Jay's homer, a battle of the bullpens commenced. The Cardinals got two scoreless innings from Kyle McClellan.

Even his lawyers concede Breivik's self-defense defense is unlikely to succeed and said the main thing for them was to convince the court that Breivik is not insane.
"Since the Browns have not shown a great sense of urgency to improve this off-season in free agency, do they actually have a War Room for the draft, or do they call it a Conflict Room? Skirmish Room?" -- Josh, South Euclid
For the Aquarians, Brittani Fiorenza singled home Jennifer Maltese who walked, advanced and then stole third. Emily Poncek and Allison Pierce both drove in runs and Tristan Scheiners bases loaded single drove in 2. Scheiner also pitched well, allowing only a run while striking out 8 in 3 innings.
Obviously Regal brought a lot of it with him, but he obviously improved and he basically married the World of Sport style with the WWE style. I think for its time, it was great. I think there's certain aspects still, like Daniel Bryan who has been in England quite a lot. Obviously he's my opponent at WrestleMania. He can definitely do a lot of that style, too, but he's a perfect example of the different styles meshed together, including Japan, UK and the American styles.
Instead of a situation where a player such as Simon -- an explosive, experienced starter on the defensive line -- might face off against a walk-on on the offensive line because of the way the teams were drafted, this will be first-team defense vs. first-team offense. Then second-team defense vs. second-team offense. Then third-team offense vs. third-team defense.
And having recently read Yi-Fu Tuan's Dominance & Affection: The Making of Pets, I found Harry's independence even more laudable, considering what humans have done to animals in the process of making them "pets." (When you stop and think about it, that's not a nice word, suggesting being "owned," controlled, at the mercy of – what else? – humans.)
"It wasn't long before she stood before me and totally owned each song."
State audits in 2006 and 2008 found that the state Department of Public Safety did not adequately track how money was spent.

Bowen possesses the same saxophone virtuosity that contemporaries such as Branford Marsalis and James Carter have ridden to widespread fame.

Although we can't always trace early ejaculation back to its roots, the good news is that the research in this field has increased considerably. There are clinically proven training techniques that a sex therapist can provide in the form of exercises to do at home which increase what is known as "ejaculatory control." Medical options have historically not been too optimal for this population. Some doctors prescribe antidepressants to men with early ejaculation, taking advantage of what is a normally unfortunate side effect of dampened sexual response, but many men are resistant to the idea of taking antidepressants for early ejaculation or are uncomfortable with the other side effects.

"Even guys who didn't have kids would show up at birthday parties for some of our kids," McMillan said. "And that kind of stuff made a difference. It was huge. When you're close like that and you build trust, you get to know each other better and you're more comfortable saying things or having each other's back. When you don't do that, then you kind of go off into your own world and it kind of becomes more about you than your group."

A: Magik*Magik is a collective run by a woman named Minna Choi, and they're based in San Francisco. We met her through John Vanderslice, because he'd brought her into his studio, Tiny Telephone. She has an office there, and they end up playing on a lot of his records. Chris (Walla, a Death Cab band member) was talking about, "A couple of these songs could use the strings, but not the kind of arrangement where they come behind the band and play the changes — like, boring strings — but something dynamic and interesting." Minna's a pretty avant-garde composer, and the arrangements she brought to the record — for "Stay Young, Go Dancing" and "Codes and Keys" — were great. And now we've had her write a number of arrangements for the rest of our catalog — some of which we've never played live before.
After high school, he worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Military Assistance Group in Cambodia for five years, until Cambodia severed relations with the U.S. in 1965. As the Vietnam War spilled across the Cambodian border and the Khmer Rouge swept the countryside, he became a guide and translator for foreign journalists. That is how, in 1972, he met Schanberg, a Singapore-based correspondent for the Times, who quickly dominated coverage of the Cambodian civil war. The temperamental journalist and the bright, resourceful Cambodian became fast friends, and by mid-1973 Dith worked exclusively for Schanberg as an official New York Times stringer.

A: I got a call to tell me that I was receiving an award. ... I was sure that they meant to call my father and not me. So I asked them if they meant my father, who is a scientist and I thought was probably more deserving than I was of this kind of award.

And because I agree with her in that, I will give her a Southern California dispensation for the final essay, "I Love Saks," about her first pilgrimage to the New York mercantile sanctum.

Starr came into the 2008 season at OSU as one of the best freshmen in the Northwest, and proceeded to appear in 16 games his rookie season, all of them in relief. He went 3-1 with a 1.61 ERA, and opponents hit just .205 against him. He should have been a core piece of OSU's pitching staff in 2009, but after throwing one game against Tennessee, he was sidelined due to Tommy John surgery. Then, in 2010, he had another Tommy John surgery and missed that season. In 2011 he didn't throw a single pitch during the season. Despite all this, Starr was drafted in the 37th round by Cleveland.

Otherwise, we're wowed. Almost everything we tell people to do for LDL and HDL, you're doing. Losing weight? Check. Walking daily? Check. Adding strength work? Check. Taking omega-3s, plant sterols, pantothenic acid (vitamin B-5)? Check, check, and check. Trying niacin? Check - but we'd tweak that. Up your dose to 500 mg and take it with aspirin before bed to decrease the risk of hot flashes, a common side effect. If your LDL and HDL don't improve on your next test, boost the niacin to 1,000 and get re-tested in three months.

AGAIN AND AGAIN: For the second time in three days, and for the third time this season, the Tigers lost a game they led in the ninth inning. They never lost a game last season they led in the ninth inning. The Tigers' last three losses have all been by 3-2, and in all of them they allowed the winning run in the ninth inning. This shows how the starting pitching is excellent, but the hitters are still in a funk and the bullpen is struggling.
"Most Europeans don't know who John Muir was," Whitny Braun said.
One of those fans was Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett. He said he first heard the Ramones in 1977 when he was 14 years old and Ramones standards "Sheena is Punk Rocker," "Rockaway Beach," and "Blitzkrieg Bop" all played on the radio within a week.
To measure however, you need more than a Carfax.

But Clemons and biographer Don Reo report that the accident was in 1968 — the year before the Jays came to Newark. And in 1969, Clemons was already 27 years old. For several years he’d been working at the Jamesburg Reform School — a job he landed through football connections after leaving his native Virginia.

Do you remember the hurricane of "historic proportions?" You most likely slept through it. Let me give you some key points to think about. Baltimore Gas and Electric cut back 1,500 personnel designed to address these types of disasters. It was more economically feasible to retain the service of others outside the utility such as members of other utilities or private sector people to call in to restore power. You can also throw the burden of this expense onto BGE customers, so the net result is it's free to BGE.

This is the key conflict of "Millennium People," the struggle between the observer and the observed. Ballard makes the point explicit by highlighting the apparatus of a security-obsessed state and juxtaposing it against the growing alienation of the middle class.

SAN FRANCISCO — The San Francisco 49ers, on their 38-yard line, were just 20 to 25 yards away from David Akers territory. With four minutes remaining and the game tied at 17, they were that close to giving their All-Pro kicker an opportunity to take the lead.

"When you start adding it all up, it really does look incredibly bleak," said TV historian and Rowan University professor David Bianculli. "As riveting as they are, most of these shows are emotionally tough to sit through.

If a majority on the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down the individual mandate or the entire Affordable Care Act, it will be a radical act of judicial activism. The high court from 1937 to 1994 did not overturn any law for overstepping Congress's commerce power  and since then only two laws unrelated to economic activity.

Here's the problem: This new government is something like a startup business. FitzGerald and the council are starting from scratch. What they do will provide a template for future office holders. But if the new council members behave like retired Fortune 500 executives -- if they worry about titles, staff and office space, if they really can't think of a new way of doing business -- they'll fail. That would undermine reform and pull Cuyahoga County off the road to a better future.

ø•The loss was caused by a sudden, unexpected or unusual event. Hurricanes, wildfires, floods and other natural disasters fit into this category, says Melissa Labant, tax manager for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Losses that stem from a long-running problem aren't deductible. For example, you can't deduct damages from a termite infestation because the IRS assumes the termites have been feasting on your house for awhile.

Because of the knee problems this is a gamble, but a low-risk gamble for the Rams given Smith's one-year deal. Smith is a smooth route runner and the Rams liked his workout during his recent Rams Park visit. A healthy Smith would've been rated higher than many of the free-agent wide receivers in this year's market. But how will the knee hold up over the course of a season? That's the unknown. Often times, players are much better in the second season after major knee surgery, and Smith's surgery was in 2010. But there are no guarantees. The Rams still probably need to come out of the draft with a couple of receivers.

But both Lewis and Oberst notice he's more at ease on stage now, though his baseball cap was on for a set he performed for KCRW's "Morning Becomes Eclectic" last month.

Mezcal has had a bad rap in much the same way Chianti did years ago because of the ubiquitous straw-covered bottle. German wines suffered from Blue Nun; Portuguese wines came in a brown crock, and Greek wines tasted like pine resin.
She didn't look too thrilled with that news. I guess the big question is: Is she upset because she doesn't want to bring another life into this godforsaken world, or because it's Shane's baby? You could also be like, 'What did she have a knife for?' But I wouldn't read too much into that. I think she had it either to open the pregnancy test with or to slash some walkers to death if they tried to bother her while she was going No. 1.
"Everybody is still learning the system, I would say," Benton said. "It is a change from what they've had in the past, but I have had success with it throughout the years.

The Lakers did not practice Thursday. Should the Lakers decide at some point that their remaining regular-season games hold little significance, they could curtail Bryant's minutes to give him a breather before the playoffs.

Nothing demonstrates this better than the GOP response in recent days to the so-called Buffett Rule, Mr. Obama's proposal to amend the income tax code so that millionaires will pay at a tax rate that is at least comparable to what middle-class Americans must pay. That example of shared sacrifice should be seen as a minimal step in bringing the nation's finances back in order. But instead, Republicans are trotting out the well-worn "class warfare" protests, claiming, as House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan did on Sunday, that the Buffett rule serves only to stifle job creation.
Tressel always acted like his father's son -- an ethical, moral coach who wanted "to help young people" and teach "life lessons." But behind the sweater vest and platitudes was a relentlessly ambitious football coach.

Lucinda and her husband -- who has lost their fortune to a crooked investor who was apparently Portland's answer to Bernie Madoff -- live in a lovely spread. Mavis, Lucinda's stepmother who refuses to open the purse strings to help out the desperate husband, also boasts a house with spiral staircase and gorgeous chandeliers. Mavis' daughters, Tiffany and the ever-sobbing Taylor, both live large, too. I haven't seen this much upscale house porn since the most recent Nancy Meyers movie.

PNC's profit was 28 percent lower than in the year-ago quarter. The bank did, however, repay the $7.6 billion loan it received through the federal government's Troubled Asset Relief Program.

Q: Hey, Hoynsie: You wrote this week that you don't believe a starting pitcher should win the MVP. I assume that this is because he only plays every fifth day. But isn't there something to be said that the pitcher is key component in every pitch for about seven innings (about 8 percent of all pitches in a season), while the position player bats only one out of nine times and records the outs when the ball comes to him (about 6-8 percent of the pitches depending on the player)? -- Steve Rieske, Bowling Green

Most Americans don't need much medical treatment in their early years and would be able to build a nest egg. Although I don't believe we should need tax incentives to do so, some modest annual tax credit might be good social policy. Insurance companies could provide discounts in future years for customers who have not used the policy, similar to auto insurance policies. It all seems sensible, but I'm not a politician.

Only 500 or so agencies used the weapons in 2000, he said.

Hey, Hoynsie: I should know this, but when does a player's pay actually start? Is it the day they show up for spring training and when does it end? Obviously, I ask because these dates would affect the amount we pay Fausto Carmona/Roberto Hernandez Heredia. If he does not make it back to the team until mid-May, does he lose three months of his $7 million salary or is it calculated differently? -- Joe Eversole, Pelham, Ala.

I'll be honest. You asked me, am I pegged as just the guy who did the quad 20 years ago? I was honestly worried that I'd be pegged as the guy who burned his house down with a leaf blower. And that worried me. I've worked really hard on my career, on my reputation, and I want my sons to grow up with a dad who was an athlete and a performer, not somebody who made this stupid mistake with a leaf blower. Maybe I underestimated people and the media. I don't think that that's happened. People have been really good about it. But I was worried that you can just do one thing wrong, and then that's who you are? It hasn't seemed to happen that way.

David said he did not know the name of the woman who was with Shaq, or of the others in the new Boston Celtics center's entourage.

The Illinois Policy Institute, a limited-government think tank, in a report cheekily titled "Another $54 Billion!?" argues that in addition to the $83 billion in pension underfunding the state acknowledges, there is $54 billion in unfunded retiree health liabilities over the next 30 years. Illinois, a stronghold of public employees unions, "is on pace to spend nearly $1 billion on retiree health care benefits in fiscal year 2013, more than double what it spent in 2003. Worse yet, these liabilities are growing more than twice as fast as tax revenues."
I actually liked the darkness of the novel, "Wicked," and as a sports geek, I enjoyed the actual football aspects of "The Blind Side" far more than the movie version I saw on a recent airplane flight. But I'll give you "Sound of Music," and add a couple of my own: "True Grit," is a classic Western for a reason, but there's something about being able to see those wide open spaces that's very powerful. And this is going to sound like nerd sacrilege, but ... I prefer the Lord of the Rings movies to the books. All that poetry makes my head hurt.

One night the salad ($9) was made with butter lettuce, wedges of mandarins, thin slices of fennel and creamy crumbles of feta. Ours looked OK and tasted great, but I noticed that as the night progressed, the chef changed the dish somewhat, cutting the citrus into thin coins, which not only looked better, but I suspect helped disperse the flavor. With a daily menu, the chefs learn on the job and adjust as they go. On other visits, arugula and Minneola tangelos replaced the butter lettuce and mandarins.

Health experts say a community needs about 95% of its citizens to be immunized against measles to ensure herd immunity, where vaccinating a large percentage of a population keeps even unvaccinated people from getting the disease. Even people who aren't vaccinated, such as newborns, get some protection from herd immunity as the disease remains limited to a small part of the community. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory condition that can lead to encephalitis, pneumonia and death. Other diseases, depending on how contagious they are, require other rates of immunization for a community to benefit. For mumps, 88% need to be immunized, and for chickenpox and polio the rate is 90%. "The Northwest is a black hole for religious exemptions" from vaccination, says Lorraine Duncan, immunization manager in the Oregon Health Authority's Public Health Division. Last year, 5.6% of Oregon kindergartners had a religious exemption for vaccines, up from 2% a decade ago, Ms. Duncan says. In some school zones around Eugene and Portland, more than 10% of children have religious exemptions, and in pockets of the state's southwestern corner, exemption rates are more than 20%, she says.
