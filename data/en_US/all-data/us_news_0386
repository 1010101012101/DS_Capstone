Craft is averaging 8.6 points, with a high of 17 points against Duke in November, but this could be a game where he really looks for his offense.
We have had people people in quality assurance or customer service who get a chance to get a promotion in game design.

The result was a bipartisan transportation-funding bill supported (and largely brokered) by the Republican governor that invested an estimated $15 billion over 20 years in roads and bridges.

Arguably the most competitive of the 16 districts is earmarked for Republican Rep. Steve LaTourette of Bainbridge Township. Though it leans toward the GOP and is probably safe for LaTourette, the proposed new 14th District conceivably could elect a Democrat who shared his genial nature and willingness to break with party orthodoxy.

Surgery for apnea tends to be most effective in those with clear structural problems that are responsive to surgery (for instance, large tonsils, deviated septum), those with more mild to moderate sleep apnea, and those who are not obese.

In fact, though the "war on terror" may be over as a concept, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor assured Michael Hirsh, the war against al-Qaida rages on. But the war is much broader than al-Qaida.

What's the downside? To hold down costs, garbage service will switch from once a week to every other week. Critics worry that reduced service won't work for large families or residents unwilling to compost.

Earlier this year, the National Consumer Law Center gave Oregon a failing grade when it analyzed the deals each state had made with banks to issue prepaid cards. The fees weren't fair, and they weren't made completely clear to Oregonians choosing to use the cards.

It's better to judge people by their actions, not their words, but what's the difference between saying you love Fidel Castro or Hitler? Leaders lead, they don't just try to be provocative. Guillen, given his position, crossed a line and should face meaningful discipline.
"I would go to my local Borders in Fresno (Calif.) and I would study Sofia Coppola's 'Marie Antoinette' published screenplay. I'd sit there - 'cause I couldn't afford it - and I'd read it and I'd read it and I'd teach myself how to screenwrite and how to, you know, frame everything."

But thankfully, no one's yet taken that to heart at Fountain Restaurant, where such veteran servers as Jim Miller and Ron Streicher still buff the crystal to a gleam and pamper customers with cheese-cart luxury like it's 1999.

She had family and friends who taught her the value of optimism, hard work and helping others. Her grandmother worked as a janitor at Rosati-Kain High School so she could attend the Catholic school in the city's more affluent Central West End, she said.

Meanwhile, the Ohio General Assembly should be more generous. The state gave BCCP $5 million for 2008 and 2009, but cut the funding almost in half for 2012 and 2013. Just $2.6 million went into the program -- $1 million of it tobacco fund money, which may not be around in the next biennial budget.
Cameron had a Plan B in his back pocket, though — or better yet, a script in a drawer. The screenplay was about a time-travelling killing machine, and as soon as producers started reading it, they wanted it. There was only one catch: If they wanted to make Cameron’s story, they had to make it with him as director.

"The Show Must Go On" wasn't Skylar's best performance. It seemed like she struggled with the low notes, but this girl is versatile and confident. Reba meets Freddie Mercury!

McCain's allusion to "spiking the football" and "doing a shameless end-zone dance" is a gross misrepresentation. Landing on an aircraft carrier in a fighter jet with a huge "Mission Accomplished" banner eight years before the end of the war, now that is spiking the football on a touchdown scored 5 minutes into the first quarter.

The most famous murals in Mexico City are at the National Palace and at Palacio de Bellas Artes. As politics, the murals' unwavering theme is the glory of ancient man, brutality of empire and mistrust of capitalism. The murals contain lots of blood, swords, a cast of thousands and naive socialist symbols. But as art, they are amazing; my favorite is the Rivera mural "The Great City of Tenochtitlan" and the Jorge Gonzalez Camarena mural "Liberation of Humanity."

It would take 9 million ounces of milk a year to feed every preemie who could benefit from it.
A grilled salmon dish ordered by our dressmaker friend was rather plain, though. It could have used a sauce, and the colcannon side dish needed more cabbage or kale -- a lot more. It reminded us more of mashed potatoes than the Irish potato-and-greens staple. My wife's Champagne Chicken Pasta ($13.95) had potential for greatness. The Ohio City Pasta fettucine was first rate, and the cream sauce with chunks of bacon tasted great. Unfortunately, the sauce had become quite congealed by the time it arrived at the table.

They're right to be dissatisfied with President Barack Obama's "accommodation" on the federal contraception mandate. They're right to make a stink.

How steep? The Economic Policy Institute recently declared an "unemployment crisis" for young workers. As of 2009, 37 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds were unemployed, the highest share in nearly four decades, according to the Pew Research Center. Among 22- to 29-year-olds, one in eight say that, because of the recession, they have boomeranged back to live with their parents.

“Thus, a Honda advertisement that accurately referenced EPA mileage estimates, truthfully stated that a driver can get ‘up to 50 mpg’ and carefully noted that mileage will vary is not misleading as a matter of law,” Honda said.
Here's the theory: One reason healthcare costs have risen so much faster than other expenses is because the people who pay the bills -- generally speaking, employers and insurers -- aren't the ones demanding the care. If individuals were more sensitive to the cost of medical services, they would stay in better shape, seek more preventative care and be smarter shoppers for the treatments they can't do without.

While still cheaper than paying American workers, the difference is not as extreme as it once was. Add to that rising costs for transportation and the uncertainty related to worldwide shipping products, and it makes sense to at least consider local production, Shenkar said.
A century and a quarter is a long time for any business to still be operating - especially in the volatile banking industry. But Home Federal Savings and Loan has proved that longevity is achievable.
The third movement ("Hunter") gets going vigorously, though the metrics and rhythms are more disjointed than fluid. The orchestra – gyrating, ripping and snorting – creates a fascinating mayhem.

Of course, we all know the ending to that story — ultimately, FDR did win 90 percent of the Jewish vote in 1944. But that came only after the president made a series of election-year gestures to the Jewish community, including creation of a government agency to rescue refugees, admission to the United States of a small number of refugees outside the quota system, and adoption of a party plank supporting Zionism (to match the GOP's pro-Zionist platform).

It has grown into a buzzing, multi-level hive with live music, but the focus remains traditional Peruvian dishes done high-style. It's not cheap, but the menu is flexible (tapas-style plates are available in three sizes), allowing you to set a budget for a meal. With such vivid, well-prepared food and such a vital atmosphere, Andina is a place to mark a special occasion -- or to make one out of an otherwise ordinary dinner.

White Oaks hasn't changed much since it opened in 1928. That's a very good thing. The look is classic -- dark wood walls and rustic oil paintings decorate the New England cabin-style eatery with the amazing woodland views. The menu is old school, too, rich with steaks, chops and other longtime favorites. There are a few contemporary nods, like the marinated Thai chicken skewers, but we chose to stick with the classics. It was a good choice. Long Island duckling, slow-roasted and glazed with a Grand Marnier, honey, kumquat, and green peppercorn sauce, was delightfully crispy outside and moistly flavorful under the skin. The filet gorgonzola, served on top of a marinated portobello mushroom and sprinkled with melted gorgonzola and a sweet balsamic reduction, was tender and savory. Caramelized scallops topped with sauteed proscuitto and creamy lobster and crab bisque were tantalizing ways to start the meal. For dessert, the lush creme brulee proved again some things never go out of style.

Outside the auction houses, artworks have traded for even more. Dealers say Greek shipping magnate George Embiricos sold his Paul Cézanne painting, "Card Players," to an anonymous buyer last year for at least $250 million.

Dealers say the likely buyers include Qatar's royal family, which declined to comment, and billionaires from Greece and Russia.

That is precisely why it is so important to understand what happened in Chile, which has a history of huge earthquakes. The previous one, in 1960, had a magnitude of 9.5 and caused widespread destruction.

However, over the last decade, more fanciful architecture and financial pressure to reduce costs have resulted in new buildings with fewer and more slender shear walls.

The top two players in Thursday's NFL Draft, in which Indianapolis again owns the first pick, will be Andrew Luck, the son of former NFL quarterback Oliver Luck from St. Ignatius, who is primarily a pocket passer, and the more mobile Robert Griffin III, who won the Heisman Trophy. Luck will be taken first, although neither he nor Griffin seems to have the commitment problems of Leaf or the schematic bewilderment of Couch.
Although most winners were announced Friday night, two recipients had already been identified. Receiving the Robert Kirsch Award, for the body of work of a Western writer, was Rudolfo Anaya, praised as the "godfather and guru of Chicano literature." The online writers community Figment was recognized with the Innovator's Award. Previous winners of the Innovator's Award, which focuses on cutting-edge business models, technology or applications of narrative art, were Dave Eggers and Powell's Books of Portland, the first bookstore ever honored.
Mountain lions are a specially protected mammal in California, and cannot be hunted.
The reality is that when our military presence overseas was less, so, too, was terrorism. Some Pentagon experts even concede that for every person we kill in night raids or drone attacks, 10 more people become supporters of terrorism. And again in agreement with Tony Bennett: Who are the terrorists? Whether the bomb is delivered by a suicide terrorist on the ground or from a drone flying overhead, innocent people are being killed and terrorized.
The National Institute on Drug Abuse is pouring resources into the development of anti-addiction vaccines and their future use as medical treatment. Should such vaccines one day become available, they may help some motivated individuals struggling to kick a particular substance, especially if coupled with other forms of treatment. But underlying issues of addiction causality, including inequality, hopelessness and the human desire for pleasure, cannot be addressed by a vaccine alone.

Still, Game 7 fell well short of the rating for the last winner-take-all Series contest, when Fox registered a 17.9 figure for Anaheim's 4-3 victory over San Francisco in 2002. But Goren said Fox sold out its Series advertising early this year and he added that combined with the American League title series that Fox carried, advertising interest is 'stronger than ever.
"She was a defense attorney," Needleman said, referring to Rawlings-Blake's career with the public defender's office. "For her to say she's disgusted without prefacing it by saying 'if these allegations turn out to be true' – it's indicative of a rush to judgment."

In the end, you wonder what the point of the whole enterprise is. It has taken years for a Stooges movie to get to the big screen. You'd think that after all that time, maybe the Farrellys, who have made funny movies ("There's Something About Mary," "Kingpin"), would have come up with something better. Instead, you wish they'd spent a little more time to try to get it right.
During construction, workers would fall off. There were a couple of fatalities. But others would survive from a fall into the water from the upper deck.
The conversation usually goes this way: proposals for impossible cuts in spending are met by equally impossible refusals to make them. Slash Medicare? Stop saving oppressed foreigners from tyranny? Raise taxes? The rock and the hard place. It's a question of standards.
"Still we were unable to pinpoint exactly where they lived, due to extensive operational security on their part," the official said. "The fact that they were being so careful reinforced our belief that we were on the right track."
The immigration measure has landed Arizona in the spotlight of a heated debate over immigration reform.

Harlow met her ideal costar when she teamed with Clark Gable for what turned out to be a string of six pictures. UCLA is showing two of them, one celebrated, one little seen. The rarer feature is "Hold Your Man" (1933), which starts with a Depression-era meet-cute between a con man and a good-time girl and ends with the pulling out of melodramatic stops that are almost beyond imagining.

There are two pizza newcomers, and I'm going to go out on a limb and say they're both the best thing to happen to Tampa in a long time (well, these two and Datz Deli, which I'm reviewing Thursday in Weekend). What's funny is that the pies are similar in aesthetic but vastly different in origin. Anthony's is the 13th restaurant for Anthony Bruno; all the rest are on the east coast of Florida. Located in Carrollwood, it's coal-oven pie, extra crispy ("well done," they call it) New York-style, no bones about it. Pizzaiolo Bavaro, in Tampa's deliciously blossoming downtown, is pure Neapolitan know-how.

Electronic devices make reading, for some people at least, easier, in addition to offering it in a sleek package that can also claim to be accessible, tactile and beautiful.
U.S. phone companies effectively have veto rights on features sported by the phones they sell. Because of the clout Apple Inc. has gained by making the world's most popular smartphone, it has been able to turn that around and dictate terms to carriers. Google doesn't have the same leverage. It tried selling the first Nexus phone on its own, without going through the carriers, but ended that experiment because of weak sales.
"For a federal agency to come along at this late date to muddy the waters is an outrage to all the community members, stakeholders and others who took the time to participate in the public process regarding the radioactive materials license," Urbina said in a prepared statement after sending the letter to NRC deputy directors in Washington, D.C.

That translates into approximately 328,000 households and is the highest rating for a Rams opener since a 28.1 figure in 2004, also for a contest against the Cardinals. And it's the best Rams rating overall since their Week 3 game in 2006 - again vs. Arizona - generated a 26.2 rating.

As a date for a vote approached, Brown, an Ohio Democrat, said several times that the Republicans’ refusal was unprecedented. In a Senate Banking subcommittee hearing on Dec. 7, the day before the vote, Brown said, "I probably know Richard Cordray better than any member of the Senate. I knew him when he was a state representative and county treasurer and state treasurer and attorney general and have continued to work with him. And there's no question of his qualification. And some time ago I asked the Senate historian has this ever happened, that a political party has blocked a nomination of someone because they didn't like the construction of the agency? And he said, no, it's never happened."
