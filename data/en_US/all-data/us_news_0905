So, how many people within Ms. Le Pen's party adhere to politics similar enough to mine that they'll vote for Mr. Sarkozy in the final round?

GULFPORT — To say the new Peg's Cantina in Gulfport is an independent restaurant is an understatement. Sure, Peg Wesselink and husband Tony Dodson's bungalow eatery is not part of a chain. But its independence runs deeper than that. They're doing things their own way, and I've got a crush, big time. First, there's the no credit card or debit card policy. It's because they don't like the idea of customers overspending heedlessly (or the restaurant paying those "usurious" user fees). Cash transactions breed thoughtfulness, and they want us to mean it.

Beyond Hana, most visitors take a 15-minute drive to the outskirts of Haleakala National Park, then walk an easy trail to the Seven Sacred Pools, also known by the much less romantic name of Oheo Gulch, where waterfalls drop into tiered pools that lead to the sea. The falls qualify as one of the most popular attractions in Maui; parking lots overflowed with buses and rental cars when I visited. Trails were similarly packed. But it was well worth the visit.

US Airways has a history of merging and then shrinking its routes. As you come down the jetway to a US Airways plane, you'll see painted on the main cabin door four miniature “heritage” logos of carriers that were merged or absorbed to create US Airways. There are Piedmont and Allegheny, two airlines that flew primarily in the Eastern United States. But the logos of Pacific Southwest (PSA) and America West represent two airlines that had a significant Orange County presence, but whose routes have all but disappeared after the merger. US Airways flies to just one city from Orange County – Phoenix, a route it inherited from America West. It dropped service to Las Vegas in the face of competition from Southwest Airlines. US Airways took over PSA in 1987 but abandoned the routes from Orange County to the San Francisco Bay Area.

In one hilarious sequence in "Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Bonham Carter plays Emma Watson playing Harry's pal Hermione pretending to be ...

Nonetheless, whether you own a car or not, knowing how to drive is an important skill that, down the road, could save a life, a marriage, a job. It is important to note that crash rates have dropped for 16-year-olds and have risen for 18-year-olds due to the amount of do-it-yourself training that anyone over 18 is allowed to use. If Detroitwas smart, they would help fund driver’s training for anyone age 16-25. One reason so many wait to get licensed, and then maybe give up on it entirely (or get on the road with inadequate training), is the high cost of such training.

The larger lesson is that, when it comes to human memory, more deliberation is often dangerous. Instead of simply assessing our familiarity with a suspect's face, we begin searching for clues and guidance. Sometimes this involves picking the person who looks the most suspicious, even if we've never seen him before, or being swayed by the subtle hints of police officers and lawyers. As a result, we talk ourselves into having a memory that doesn't actually exist.

It had taken a good 25 minutes of game time for anyone inside Madison Square Garden to breathe, so they were going to wear their lungs out now, and their throats, and their voiceboxes.

"NOTHING PERSONAL": You've seen the premise before -- two loners develop a relationship that slowly grows from reticence to deep respect and attraction -- but first-time feature writer-director Urszula Antoniak displays enough craft and visual sumptuousness to make this paean to solitude a subtly emotional, if a bit vague, affair.

Desserts (all $8) also put a smile on my face, and like the savory courses, each one had twist. After struggling over the six options - chocolate chunk and banana bread pudding? Orange blossom honey creme brulee with vanilla salt? Warm olive oil crepes with lavender roasted strawberries? - I finally decided on the ricotta beignets. They were actually more like doughnut holes, served warm on a divided plate with a compartment for the black pepper whipped cream, candied bacon bits and caramelized pineapple relish.

Sometimes he may sense that he has to "work too hard" to move air in and out of the lungs (harder than what the brain may sense as "normal"). Sometimes the patient may, over time, be afraid to do much of any physical activity because of his lung issues and come to develop weakness in the heart and other muscles.

If the West must contend with the doublespeak of Russian foreign policy, pity the poor souls at home. Remember the fallen oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky? He was no angel, mind you, but he still doesn't deserve a place on death row (he's likely to contract multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis) in a Siberian jail. Remember the tragedy of the 2004 Beslan school hostage-taking? Or the theater siege in Moscow in October 2002? Both ended in unconscionably high body counts in large part, of course, thanks to the terrorists who orchestrated the attacks. But as the Beslan mothers and the Moscow theater survivors know, the ineptitude of the Russian security forces also contributed mightily. Then, in both tragedies, there was the coverup -- doublespeak written in blood.

Hey, Tony: Regarding Joe Flacco, a couple of years ago, you mentioned the Browns were the only team in the AFC North without a franchise quarterback (when Carson Palmer was still in Cincinnati). You consistently heap praise on Flacco as if he is destined to be a longtime stud in the NFL. Well, he's in an offense that features Anquan Boldin, Ray Rice, Lee Evans, and speedster Torrey Smith yet he's on pace to have the lowest completion percentage and most interceptions of his four-year career. Let's be honest with ourselves, all this Flacco kid has on our own Colt McCoy is a stronger arm. Nothing else. You fall in love with the big arms, don't you Tony? -- Joshua Jones, Fullerton, Calif.

I do not follow college or professional sports; however, I am aware of certain coaches and players that have become icons in our world. Joe Paterno was synonymous with Penn State. To many he represented college athletics at its pinnacle. The playing of a sport is often used as a metaphor for life — its joy and its vicissitudes. Young people look up and revere their coaches. The fact that Mr. Paterno heard a report of a child being sexually molested and told this to his superiors but did not follow through is an egregious act on his part. Mr. Paterno has had a long and illustrious run with Penn State football, but in my mind all this pales in the face of his "sin of omission." His lack of integrity is what will always stand, not his heroic football record.
“Does it concern me? Yeah,’’ Roy said. “I would love to play more minutes and have a much better body, but it’s just not the case, so I have to try and make the most of what it is. I had a phone call yesterday and in talking to a few people, it is somewhat of a reality check. This is what it is, and now you have to make the most of it.’’
Most of all, I wonder how my understanding of God would have been different. It's a dangerous business, conflating God and the clergy, yet people do it all the time. The combination of exclusively male clergy and exclusively masculine language about God can lead people to believe that women are somehow excluded from the sphere of the sacred. While my first intellectual inkling that something was wrong with that picture began in the classroom, I really knew it in my bones when I became a mother myself. The birth of my first child was a moment of great spiritual clarity and power, and I never again doubted that women could be as close to God as men. It was during that pregnancy that I first experienced my sense of call to ordained ministry as an objective "something" outside myself, as an actual call from God and not a mere personal desire, and I'm sure that the timing was not coincidence. Looking back, I see it as God's way of affirming for me that motherhood, too, was a calling, and that there could be room in my life for both vocations.
Unemployment benefit applications have started to tick up in recent weeks after months of steady declines. When applications fall below 375,000, it generally suggests hiring will be strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.

By far the biggest category of spending we will need to cut, however, is that for programs which actually have merit, and in most cases make sense, but which we simply cannot afford at this time. Like any family, and like forty two other states with constitutionally required balanced budgets, we must live within our means. New Jersey does not have a revenue problem—we already have higher taxes than any other state in the union. We have gone down the road of ever higher taxes to pay for Trenton’s addiction to spending. What has it given us? 10.1 percent unemployment, a dormant economy and a failure of hope for growth in our future. Higher taxes is the road to ruin. We must, and we will, shrink our government.

In retrospect, that 50th anniversary celebration of the NBA in 1997, while meant to salute the 50 greatest players of all time, was really about the new forces that were going to distort pro basketball for both good and bad.

This method produces some quirks. A city with below-average levels in five of the categories but a very high level of, say, car theft could score poorly. Also, if crime is down nationally, a city whose crime rate falls more slowly could see its crime ranking rise. And there is very little difference near the middle of the rankings, meaning differences of 20 or 30 ranking positions might not be statistically significant.

"This is a double edged sword," said Chacon, because while the federal government would pay to feed additional Calfresh recipients, the pilot project could leave California with a heavier caseload of Calfresh recipients long after the pilot project has ended. And the state is still responsible for 35 percent of the costs associated with administering the Calfresh program, with local county governments responsible for an additional 15% of administrative costs. If the pilot project were to be successful, however, sharing Social Security data might simplify the application process and lower administrative costs.

Thirty-nine states, including Michigan, limit marriage to relationships between and a man and a woman, either through state law, constitutional provisions or both, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Six states and Washington, D.C., issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and two more -- Maryland and Washington -- passed laws this year to allow same-sex marriages, though both could be challenged in referendums. In California, a federal appeals court ruled that the state's restriction on same-sex marriage was invalid but it still is not allowed pending appeal.

Candidates are then qualified to one of three levels as they complete the modules, with level three to those that complete all three.

5. Lee Westwood, England -- Even though he struggled to a 2-under-par 74 in the final round, Westwood successfully defended his title in the rain-delayed CIMB Indonesian Masters, winning by two strokes over Thaworn Wiratchant of Thailand. It was the 37th victory of his career around the world and the first this year after he won four times in 2011. The Englishman has won twice on the PGA Tour, at the 1998 Freeport-McDermott Classic and the 2010 St. Jude Classic. … After making the long round trip to Indonesia, Westwood is taking one week off to recuperate and plans his PGA Tour return for the Wells Fargo Championship. Having rejoined the PGA Tour this season, he also is playing the following week in the Players Championship, which he skipped last year even though he has recorded three top-10 finishes at TPC Sawgrass, including a tie for fourth in 2010. … The 39-year-old Westwood played the last 14 holes of the third round on Sunday morning at Royale Jakarta Golf Club, posting a 7-under-par 65 to take an eight-stroke lead into the final round. Playing 32 holes on the last day, he struggled in the afternoon with consecutive bogeys on the fifth and sixth holes and then again at the 13th and 14th. However, he finished with four consecutive pars to hold off Wiratchant, formerly No. 1 on the Asian Tour, who closed with a 67 that included birdies on the last two holes. Westwood, who started with rounds of 65-68, said he fought fatigue over the last six holes.
