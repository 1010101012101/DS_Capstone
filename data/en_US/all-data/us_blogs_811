5) Geocentrism as Biblical Literalism: Last, but not least, it seems that the motivation for modern geocentrists to hold these loony views, despite all of the evidence & science against them, is based in their particular reading of the Bible. In other words, their particular set of religious beliefs trump all of scientific reality. Or, to put it another way, they are engaging in some really interesting mental gymnastics to come to the conclusion of “the Bible is literally true” and retrofit all evidence (through liberal use of cherry-picking, goalpost moving, and in some cases outright lying) to jibe with their religious views.
So, what are some of my favorites?

* Glen Heroy (Cornelius) has recently attained lots of national exposure on the PBS reality series Circus, which followed him around as he performed with Big Apple Circus. Cornelius plays spoons with the Maestrosities, and judging by his décor and demeanor they seem to be spoons stolen from the commissary at Sing-Sing. Cornelius reminds me of Swedish wrestler and Ed Wood cast member Tor Johnson – simultaneously scary and lovable.

Someone once asked me what do I do when the daily routine "falls apart?" In a classroom of three year olds, this is a valid concern. My threes have been known to send teachers out of the room crying (myself included)! I don't blame them...they are three, and act accordingly. When you put twenty 3 year old children in a room, there is bound to be some drama, no matter how wonderful and patient the teacher is.
I told my class about this, and they all seemed very supportive of the idea, especially those who have missed most or all of recess as a result of the above mentioned reasons. Of course, today was also the day that I had a meeting at 1:15, so I had a sub come in at that time, and there was no time for her to go over what I had asked her to teach if she was going to be taking them outside for recess fifteen minutes after she arrived. So today didn’t actually work out as planned, but hey, that’s life, right? If we don’t get to the new schedule changes this week, we’ll definitely be able to start next Monday!

The stories told around the island in their kitchen. I think of Linda’s house in Pennsylvania and the comfy sofa that was always perfect for naps. The amazing aromas coming from her kitchen.

In effect, Wednesday's ruling means every parolee — and every inmate about to be paroled — who was not convicted of a sex-related crime must receive a hearing and be allowed to present a defense before sex-offender conditions can be applied to their parole, defense lawyer Scott Pawgan said. "This now applies to everyone, even though (parole officials) desperately tried to limit it," Pawgan said.Lindell says officials don't know for sure how many cases will be affected, but parole attorney Bill Habern tells me via email the case will force review of sex-offender conditions for around 6,900 parolees. Said Habern, "I hope folks understand what a real statement this is for the CCA and for those who do not deserve sex offender and sex offender related parole conditions. They ruin your life."

For almost a century, their bodies were unable to be found.

Until today I had never heard of Mr Don Ritchie. But having just read about how this man reached out and prevented about 160 people from suicide at “The Gap“, a notorious suicide spot along coastal cliffs in Sydney’s east, I wish I’d heard of him earlier. Unfortunately, he passed away yesterday at the age of 85. Methinks this man deserves a few more public accolades for being such a wonderful citizen. Click on his photo below to read the full story.
At minimum, there are two simple steps you should take to secure your laptop if you are going to use a WiFi network on the road. The first is that you should protect your laptop with a firewall, so that other computers do not have easy access to data or services on your laptop. Most operating systems come with a firewall built in. If you use the built in firewall, the main thing you need to do is make sure it is enabled. For Windows users, there are additional third-party firewalls such as Zone Alarm and Comodo that offer more sophisticated protection.

Speaking of boots, in an attempt to organize myself this weekend I went through all of my knee-high boots and tried them on to see if they still fit. I can't zipper most of them up even halfway. I'm pretty upset about it considering I've paid a lot of money to have most of my boots stretched over the past couple years. I guess my right calf is more swollen than I give it credit for. So I'm going to hang on to my favorites for at least a year (which is when my leg should be back to "normal") and sell the others. Boo hiss! I know there are far worse problems to have out, but it's just on my mind.

While exploring the internet, I came across some hand-made envelopes, ones made from recycled paper from magazines, books, advertising flyers etc. I was rather intrigued and wondered if they would be a good match for my hand printed cards. I searched books and found a used instructional book that contained templates – just so I could see if there was any trick to making these wonderful envelopes. No, no tricks involved. You can make your own templates by taking apart any envelope you’d like to duplicate. Just work carefully, lay it out flat and trace the outline to make your pattern. There are an amazing number of variations in envelope patterns and sizes, but they all produce a similar product. Some patterns make better use of an 8 1/2″ x 11″ piece of paper, but that seems to be the major difference.

I started my first dose of one 500 mg pill once in the morning. Per my Doctors orders I had to up the dose to two 500 mg. pills a day -- one in the AM and one in the PM. Ugh!! I feel like I have severe morning sickness, plus, its messing with my lower GI tract as well. Running to the bathroom is literal for me now. No more casual, "oh let me just run to the restroom." Nope. Now it's, "Oh Lord, please let the bathroom be empty, and please don't let the next person going in see who came out." Yep. Nice huh?

Prescriptive commentators agree. Garner’s Dictionary of Modern American Usage finds it “indisputable that different than is sometimes idiomatic, and even useful”. Fowler saw nothing wrong with different to: “That d. can only be followed by from & not by to is a superstition.” Ernest Gowers, in The Complete Plain Words, says there is “good authority for different to . . . Different than is not unknown even in The Times”. Good heavens! And here is Eric Partridge, a fussier observer than most:
"We adopted the following criteria:
How is it possible to separate a relationship with God from serving God? Can a person wholeheartedly believe in him yet divorce that belief from service? Is it possible to say, “Hey, God. I have this super relationship with you … but I’m not going to do anything about it until after I’ve met these other demands. Once I’ve fulfilled my obligations to serve my spouse, and serve my employer, and serve my nation, and serve my children, then I’ll serve You.”

There doesn’t seem to be much more that I can really say about this movie. It didn’t live up to the hype and was a huge let down in terms of superhero movies. When we’ve been so privileged to watch movies like X-Men, Spiderman and Iron Man, there really is no excuse for Thor to be as disappointing as it was. There was so much potential here for this to be an epic movie that could spawn sequel after sequel, but they just didn’t take the opportunity (I know that Thor 2 is in the works, but why even bother?). However, I hold out hope that they will continue to flush out this story line in The Avengers to a point where I can somehow rescind on some of this review. As I said previously, the casting of this movie was well done and, as long as there is more substance behind these actors, Thor can easily be salvaged.
Dia - If you say to a deaf kid, "Hey, kid, you matter," but then the kid can't find books/magazines/movies/TV shows/video games about other deaf kids, then in what way are you demonstrating his importance? The kid looks around at other people being represented and not only does he not feel important--he feels like he doesn't exist. So diversity means being able to see yourself, no matter how out of the mainstream you are, reflected in society. I don't think we're even close to being truly diverse, but I try to do my part as a writer--maybe one day I'll succeed.

Universities, those in the top tiers anyway, discourage free thought. Actually, they discourage any thought. Well, that’s not completely true, they encouraged fantasy and weirdness. For example, early on, “feminists” loathed Ernest Hemingway. Loathed him. They “found” all sorts of white, male, patriarchal “evidence” (of some anti-woman “code”) in everything he wrote (this was made possible by the nuts who took the “isms,” married them with “deconstruction,” and smashed all that into a “post-structural” theory omelet to “prove” . . . oh who the hell knows what . . . it’s all Marxist crap at root, but they like to add layers in the absence of actual critical thinking). But Hemingway scholars were loathe to buy into this, careers at risk and all, so they made him not the macho, He-Man hunter- fisherman, they made him the effeminate, gender-bending “androgynist” (this crap permeated Hemingway studies for a decade, but it made him acceptable to contemporary literary theory) . Yep, Earnest was a great big gay who wished he was a woman. Uh-huh. That’s how they teach him now. Not his literary merit (huge) or his skill with narrative (also huge), but as a great big woman, who didn’t get the free “health care” he needed to be the woman he always wanted to be. Crazy? Sure. Who cares if he’s gay, straight, or whatever? Oh, right, leftists bent on division. Got it.

Couple being completely and totally swamped (no pun intended) with work with the fact that the fourth of the Christian-Newsom trials started that same Monday in Knoxville, which I would have liked to have been able to keep up with throughout the week but there just wasn’t enough time in the days to do so; checking on updates of online acquaintances who have been been dealing with a nightmarish tragedy of the non-flood type; and scrambling to put Band-Aid fixes on what I guess is just going to keep being an ongoing calamity of sorts here on the home front – even if I’d had four or five clones of myself, I’m not sure there would have been enough for me to go around.

fancied our chances in finding Kuhanya taking shelter in a Maroela Tree somewhere in thevicinityy she had been seen in the morning. We set off to check the area and all her favourite haunts in the region paying particular attention to all the large shady trees. Spending the vast majority of the first part of drive criss-crossing Motswari we came up empty handed and eventually resorted to checking an old pump house she likes to frequent on extremely warm days but even here there was no sign of her. With nowhere else to check we decided to head to the South West in search of the Rhino's that we had seen in the morning believing they definitely would not have travelled far. We would return to the area after dark to look for Kuhanya once more. On our way South we received the good news that the Rhino's had in fact not actually moved and were to be found in nearly the exact same spot as they had been in the morning. As it was a long drive it took us a fair time to get there but we were keen on the sighting as it was the one request of our new guests that had joined us for the next couple days. Along the way there we found a number of tracks and signs for a few different breeding herds of Elephant and eventually got lucky in bumping into a small herd that was spread out feeding. They too were feeling the heat and you could see that they had come
Whatever comfort the angel brought the Saviour was transient. The angel’s mission was not to bring relieif to Christ, but to strengthen him for further and even greater anguish – anguish quite beyond human endurance. It was then that our Lord ‘being in an agony . . . prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling to the ground’ (Luke 22:44). The angel’s presence served to aggravate his suffering. It was in order that the suffering might not only be maintained, but also that it might be intensified that the angel was sent. The battle must go on. It was too soon to say ‘Finished’. The Lamb of God must have the strength of a lion in this struggle.

"There are many reasons I don't like store-bought shampoos, deodorants, soaps, creams, and other bodycare products. Even the "natural" ones, though mostly better than your average pharmacy brands, have chemicals I'd really rather not use, and also tend to be really pricey! I decided a while ago that there must be better options, and I'm slowly but surely going DIY for all of the products I used to buy from the store."

By bringing all these health professionals together to create personal relationships, work for the greater good of healing and curing children, and develop a level of trust and understanding, Noyek and his thousands of colleagues (all of whom volunteer) have created a tiny, thriving, hopeful, amazing microcosm of what peace might look like in the Middle East. (And because Noyek just can’t stop building peace, the CISEPO model of “health-to-peace” networks of professional cooperation and knowledge sharing in conflict zones is being rolled out in Zimbabwe, Ethiopia and beyond.)

She might idolise Thatcher, but she insists she doesn’t want to be her. “I don’t really want a major role,” she says. “I don’t think I could manage it with being a mother.” As a divorcee with three children under nine, she has permanent leave from the chief whip to miss Thursday night votes. She also rather ostentatiously left a Select Committee meeting announcing she was off to pick up her children – that instinct, again, for doing something human in a highly visible context.
It is interesting that, per Joyce, nobody drinks Guinness in Davy Byrne's, since the pub featured in a recent advertising campaign celebrating the 250th anniversary of the brewery's founding. In one television advert, drinkers are seen outside the pub offering a toast "To Arthur!" a reference to brewery founder Arthur Guinness, and in a semi-humorous relay of Chinese Whispers across Dublin pubs, the toast becomes increasingly distorted: "To Martha!" "To Hearth Rugs!" "To Bath Plugs!" "To Garth Brooks!" "To Garth Crooks!" and so on, until it has done the rounds of Dublin and gets back to Davy Byrne's, by which time the drinkers have actually sampled the brew. At that point, they shout, as one, "To Lager!" and spend the rest of the night drinking Stella.
In the United States, during the advent of second wave feminism, 1960s and 1970s, the Women's Movement encouraged women to pay their own way or to pay for men's meals. It is accepted by some that, on a date between a woman and man, the man takes initiative when it comes to paying the bill, meaning he is the one to pay

My community pool is a jole, doing laps in it, is a lot like the scene in Austin Powers where he attempts to get the golf cart out between two objects. He ends up going back and forth over tiny distances and looking ridiculous. This is my community pool. But I live in Florida right? There is water everywhere around you! Ugh, Yes and No. The closest beaches to me are an hour away. To get there early enough to swim them would require getting up at the monk like time of 3 or 4 am in the morning. I am pretty dedicated about my fitness, but not that dedicated. And lets add also, Im not that willing to spend a lot of gas money driving to the beach consistently. But Florida is full of lakes and ponds? Yes, and they are full of alligators. I have a personal alligator avoidance policy that has served me well. No swim is worth that risk. But you belong to a gym? It has no pool, none whatsoever. Some of the YMCA gyms have pools but membership there is not convenient, more expensive than my current ones, and the locations are not close to my house (again gas money). So any attempt to incorporate in a fun swim into my workout week is all for naught.
The green drape is a silk organza curtain I bought at Goodwill. It was initially a chartruse color, but I dyed it darker using Acid Dyes from Dharma Trading Co. I also dyed a bunch of other light colored dupioni so I would have extra silk to create additional flounces. These extra bits came out as entirely different colors, despite being in the same dye load. I suppose this comes down to the different composition of materials; lesson learned.

Still, it’s not as if she had much choice, the laws of nature being what they are. After all, we all know how much easier it would be for parking the car if we weren’t just limited to the four dimensions of conventional space time. Sod the Star Trek warp drive, what would be a greater boon to the human race would be the warp car parking space that could somehow unfold out of some other dimension or something to enable you to park with ease, and - once parked – get out of the car without having to perform some Olympic–standard gymnastic routines to unfold your body out of the less than two inches of room you have to open the car door without hitting the car in the adjacent space or some bollard, waste bin, light fixture or some other street furniture the creator of the car park littered across the place like some concrete, metal and plastic confetti.

I live in complete bliss knowing that I likely won’t ever come even close to that level. It’s sort of liberating not feeling the need to even try. But I have a wonderful family, a job I enjoy and a life for which I’m grateful. My life isn’t perfect – there’s always something that I know I should be doing to make it better. But I choose happiness. And my main point is that I truly believe that happiness is just that – a choice.

If you dig deeper, it is also about questions of where the rich-poor divide comes from: Is it just about hard work? Or is it because it takes money to make money, and those that start at the bottom of the pile face a much harder climb?

That’s what I call my office at The Job. A: because it’s friggin’ freezing, 24/7; and B: because I close the door, and I am in my own little world.

Several times, I’ve been in there, working "late" (which, in gubment terms means, "after 4"), and when I come out, everybody’s gone. Split. Outta there.

One of the most embarrassing things about writing a blog about your own life is sometimes reading it back and realizing what an idiot you were. It’s bad enough when I realize it in the moment like when I wrote the post I tenderly titled, Idiot. I was angry at myself. I trusted a man when there were warning signs. When I wrote that post I felt like I was hanging in midair about to plummet to my death.

The Gluttony inspires the Lust, and vice versa. Nothing like indulging in a $25 or above cocktail while sitting on a “bed” poolside, watching all the other bodies cavorting around you.

It’s probably certain that you can handle the business where it is right now, but think about where you want it to be five or ten years down the road. What about when it’s ten times the size that it is now? Growth and expansion is the ultimate goal for any company, and if you’re taking it seriously that’s what you should be striving for. Are you the kind of person who can handle giving out orders down a long chain of command, or would you rather be in the workshop, dreaming up new innovations to propel the business forward. Both of these roles are necessary, and it takes a different type of person to do each one.
Tears rose to her eyes while thinking about Arham. He loved her so much. And even she loved him. But something still connected her to Shahzeb. Something was there which was not letting her go. Something which niggled her at the back of her mind. Something which disturbed her every night she tried to sleep. Something which was not letting her bury the past and move on. Earlier, she knew nothing about this something, but today, while standing here in the corridors of her college, the epiphany had happened. Previously, she thought that it was Love which connected her to Shahzeb, but she now realized that it was not so. She had stopped loving him the day he let her down. Moreover, since that day till the present times, his memories had caused her nothing but pain and agony. She could neither punish nor forgive him for whatever he did and THIS was the something which kept her attached to his memories all this while. In order to give up on him, she needed to throw away that hatred and dejection which now resided in her heart. Forgiving him was totally out of question. So it was now time for the punishment. She had heard somewhere that Untold Sacrifices Were Never Valued. It was time Shahzeb needed to know about all the sacrifices she had to make when they were together. She would now make him realize that she did not deserve a jerk like him. She got what she deserved. She had her Arham.

After ONE day of not eating clean we noticed we were more achy (could have been the sunburns), tired (could have been the margaritas) and had less energy. When we got back home we went back to eating Paleo, most of the time. We’ve definitely been cheating on our diet the past month. Now we’re ready to attack it again. Though this time we won’t be preparing our bodies for a beach vacation, we’ll be getting leaner and stronger for our wedding.

My solution? I prioritized the list. I started with the one thing which was causing me the most angst, a job which wasn’t feeding my soul. We spend approximately one third of our lives performing some sort of work, so I personally believe this time should be spent in a manner befitting our moral values and in alinement with our spiritual compass. I’m sure there are many moral/spiritual accountants, physicians, delivery (wo)men, cashiers, and hairdressers. It’s not what you do, but whether your work is in line with your soul’s destiny. You will feel, deep in your gut, if it is or isn’t. And only you can decide if you should change careers or not. The decision was easy for me, through no fault of my own, I was laid off.

The second attempt by the British to colonize the Boers resulted in the Second Anglo-Boer War of 1889 - 1902 (once again note that it is called the Anglo-Boer war and not the Anglo-Afrikaner war). This war resulted in the development by the Boers of the guerrilla warfare method, since used by many liberation movements in all parts of the world. Although the Boers fought bravely against overwhelming odds, the British used a cruel & until then unheard measure of fighting - they rounded up as many Boer women and children as they could find and put them into concentration camps scattered around South Africa. In these camps, as a result of judicial executions, starvation, disease and ill treatment, some 27 000 Boer women and children died - some 20% of the total Boer population of the time.

First, let's talk about "fear." I know the word is being used in a somewhat casual sense here but for me at that school there was a more significant depth to that word than "I'm afraid it might rain." More like "I'm afraid to hold this grenade with the pin out when the spoon looks like it might not be completely engaged."
Three men with arms like legs approached me. "Are you English?" They'd observed me apparently cracking the code of the Turkish phone system - 5 minutes puzzling over a huge, flabby directory in a dingy Istanbul post office, 1984 - and getting as far as making a call (to the British Embassy, unsuccessful). I clued them in on how the phones worked. "But what's that?" said I, peering intently at their T-shirts, from which protruded their Olympic scale arms:

Now, it should also be pointed out that proponents of the pig hunt argued that the pig contraception program would not have worked. I can’t claim to know either way. Nor, for that matter, was I able to verify the claim that Tim Setnicka said the project was based on “junk science.” Nonetheless, it’s striking that Pollan chooses to ignore these questions rather than address them, taking a few words out of context to support the point he wants to make.
In the 1960's, the New Vaudeville Band's 1920-ish megaphone hit "Winchester Cathedral" won a Grammy for Best Contemporary Recording while Paul McCartney dabbled in Roaring Twenties song craft with tunes like "Your Mother Should Know" and "Honey Pie". In the 1970's, the 30's were hot. Moviegoers flocked to theaters for "The Sting" and "Paper Moon". And the trend goes continues today, or so Gopnik would have us believe.

While I've been flirting with the whole idea of trying out the natural starter/old-school methods of making bread for awhile now, I think I'm going to do a little more reading and research before embarking on such a commitment. In the meanwhile, I am pretty happy to continue playing with the many variations of no-knead breads that have developed over the last 5 years.
If you don’t have that confidence, then it’s the same steps as buying a TV. Research online, see what you need, compare prices and go in-store to learn more about the product and see if there are any in-store deals. Keep shopping around until you find a computer in your price range. Check for any open promotions as well, such as free monitors and free printers. Opt-out from any services they may offer you (such as installing virus protection software or “optimizing” your PC). These services can cost a few hundred dollars and you can easily do these yourself by just doing a search online. It won’t even take you more than an hour.

And third, is there a way we can use all of this gnosis to dig our way out of the rut we're all stuck in. We really don't talk much about comics or superheroes at all, more about practical paranormality if such a thing exists. If it doesn't I think it's damn high time someone creates it.
I've previously used the analogy of two black holes, with gravity so strong that virtually everyone will be sucked into any one of these extremes. I'll now present another analogy for these discussions about the JQ. It's a trench war with each party deeply entrenched on each side of the battlefield. It's a situation of complete deadlock. No one is really trying to come to a common view of things, just fervently dismissing each other and dig deeper into the trenches. And here comes another analogy from the First World War: anyone who crosses the battlefield between the two lines will be met by crossfire. I have been placing myself at that field a number of times. Being a man of moderation, I've been wanting to present a balanced view. But generally I have been dismissed from both sides as an extremist. Of course there's no logic to that. But then there's no logic to the two trenches where these combatants have put themselves -- no more than a quarrel between a married couple. It's all deeply emotional.

In real life, Sutherland has a better grip on the digits at hand: 12 million viewers watched the Touch preview that aired in January. The series, created by Tim Kring, the writer and producer behind Heroes, launches for real with a global media event on March 18 — a date that figures prominently in Touch's opening episode. The premiere re-airs that week in more than 100 countries around the globe and on March 22 in the United States. The wait-and-see preview combined with a worldwide rollout makes it an unprecedented launch for TV. "I'm feeling nervous," Sutherland says, lighting a cigarette. "There's a lot riding on this, and I know what it means to have a hit show, certainly."
I’m 11 weeks into the 16 week plan. I’ve had setbacks, like icy roads and food poisoning, but I’ve recovered and settled back into the schedule, with a few adjustments. Except for muscle aches after my long Sunday runs, my body doesn’t hurt. I’ve come to expect knee and ankle pain with running, but I’ve had no joint pain this year. Last year, in mid-January, I deveIoped piriformis syndrome (aka “pain in the butt,” an irritation of the sciatic nerve) and it only got worse during my training. This year, probably thanks to the cross-training and strength training, I’ve avoided the syndrome. I feel like I am in the best shape of my life. We’ll see how it all plays out on May 6th!

True, ultimately all authority is derivative from God himself but I fail to see how this establishes a partite kingdom in a Witness sense. God is a unique being, and only he is sovereign over all. Only he is able to rule from heaven over all the earth. Jesus is said to have David’s throne, a rulership which is terrestrial, earthly, though God-given. (Luke 1:32-35)

Loved the romantic interest! Chase was really cute and had Hartley all tied up in knots from the beginning. I’m really looking forward to seeing how they move on with the relationship in future books. But I must say…it’s more of a tease than a spoiler…that scene under the bed…take it off! lol I totally would have let him keep stripping. Yes, this is wrong of me, No, my teenage self would have stopped him too…but my adult self was distracted by the abs!

The irrational can be countered by observation. If you look under the bed, you can see there’s only dust there. Or there is a bug eyed monster. The irrational fear is countered, hopefully. In the latter example the fear becomes entirely rational because if you see the monster under the bed, then there’s now a concrete threat to your safety.
I could go on about how the women in the book are portrayed, and the character development or lack thereof. Bombatta isn’t really a bad kind of guy, and he passes up the opportunity for redemption, continuing to follow in Tamaris’ evil plans for Jehnna. Instead I think I’ll just compare this book to Pringles. I love Pringles. I can’t get enough of those crunchy, stackable, starchy snacks devoid of any nutritional value. Just like I enjoyed this violent, sexist romp through a fantasy world, with absolutely no other virtue save entertainment.

Americans are fighting and dying against this kind of thinking among Islamic extremists. When and how are we going to deal with our own extremists?
How effective such a strategy would prove in deterring further killings is impossible to determine in advance. But the possibility that this strategy might not succeed does not render it ill-advised or foolish. Given that wars tend to have losers, there is always some group of people whose strategies are being proved inadequate in some sense. During the Pacific War, the Japanese strategy was to launch lightning attacks throughout south-east Asia, secure a huge resource base, and build up a strong enough naval deterrent to inflict such casualties on an American counter-attack across the Pacific as to force America to seek terms rather than fight the war to a conclusion. The fact that this strategy failed does not mean that it did not make any sense. It simply means that it did not work, which is not necessarily the same thing.

I don’t personally think that taking phones away from kids is the answer. But giving your teen a phone and turning them loose with no supervision isn’t a good idea either. Texting can be a great communication tool. Texting lets parents and their children stay in touch, it’s a convenient way to ask your spouse to pick up a gallon of milk on his way home from work, and it helps you to avoid hour-long conversations with that one long-winded friend everyone seems to have.

So, he's got an appointment next week with a cat only vet that he has seen before but had to be sedated to be examined and the sedation gave him bronchitis, so I fear this. He has a chronically cloudy eye from a scratch that's been treated but won't completely clear up. And now, his other eye has a spot in it. His right ear bothers him and he coughs sometimes. It's just time for a good checkup, and I'm scared of the experience as well as possible results.
By the first definition, I am indeed an atheist, but I reject that term for myself because I know that people assume that atheism is about outright denial of God’s existence (the second definition) and nothing else. By contrast, I question God’s existence and do not deny it at all. My position is a neutral one regarding that specific issue.
Joe and I take frequent “wanders” in the nearby nature preserve. We discovered the trail which leads down a little moraine to Lake Nagawicka—the quiet, natural end of the lake. This will be a spot for sitting and sketching, when I can’t be at home up north over the next few months.

Mothers in Zion, your God-given roles are so vital to your own exaltation and to the salvation and exaltation of your family. A child needs a mother more than all the things money can buy.

It is always so hard to sum up a really good experience so that someone who wasn't there can truly understand and enjoy it the way you did. It's not really possible, you know. There is no way they can feel it or experience it the same way when they weren't there. As I sit here wanting to write about our time in Ireland, I am stumped with how to begin. Maybe I'll just have to do it in several posts. Whatever. I'll just begin and see where it goes from there.
Some days you just have to get out and hike. It may not be a big mileage day, and it may not lead to an amazing waterfall or astounding mountain-top view, but sometimes you just have to go. Last Saturday was one of those days. For a variety of reasons I felt like there was a pretty big weight on my shoulders last week. And Sarah needed some quiet time to get some things done. So Saturday morning I gathered up my youngest son and we hopped in the car and headed up to Abrams Creek Ranger Station. It's only about 30 minutes from my house to the ranger station / campground so it's a good spot for us when we want (or need!) a quick hike.

The motions do reveal two new items: (1) that Nifong was “advised to drop prosecution of the Duke lacrosse defendants.” Harr doesn’t reveal who advised Nifong to take this course; and (2) that after her 2010 conviction for arson-related charges, Mangum was expelled from her graduate studies at North Carolina Central. Falsely accusing people of rape, apparently, doesn’t affect a student’s status at NCCU; conviction on misdemeanor arson charges does.
I used a pink card from a pack of blank cards I purchased at walmart on clearance a while back and the color was perfect for the colors of the flowers I printed from the Imagine Lori's Garden at 3". The Thank You phrase and mat is from the Lori's garden cart that I changed the colors from blue and gree to pink. The butterfly border is from MS! I love that punch! Just got it and couldn't wait to use it! I used the Cuttlebug and a folder from "Love is in the Air" I think, for the embossed background, which I then used a white inkpad and went over the top of the embossing to enhance it a little. The glitter button in the middle is made from a pop dot! Clear and then rolled it in MS Cotton Candy glitter!! Perfect color!
I am really happy with a lot of my writing this year. Something that could be seen as a bad thing is I didn’t finish a lot of stories. But I actually see that as a good thing. The way I look at it, there are at least five novellas/novels that I can now go back to at any point. I never would have started these if it weren’t for this new years resolution I took so long ago.
Do you agree that If Saddam Hussein had flooded the Kurdish villages with non-Kurds and ordered the Kurds to “assimilate” and “celebrate this diversity” and thereby demographically wiping out the Kurds as an ethnic group he WOULD have been GUILTY of committing an intentional act of genocide?
In the end, this whole question of how much setting detail a writer needs to provide is like the quest for just the right word. You’ve probably heard of Mark Twain’s famous statement that the difference between the right word and the almost-right word is the difference between “lightning” and “lightning-bug.” (It seems to me that a better contrast would be between “lightning bolt” and “lightning bug,” but that’s an issue for another day.) In either case, the analogy is apt: either form of lightning—bolt or bug—provides inadequate illumination, just inadequate in different ways.

So why was I feeling sad this morning? Because I’ve procrastinated and avoided. Plain and simple. I could have forced (?) my son to dig out the rest of the towels so I could get them all washed. But I didn’t. I hate arguing with him (and yes, there would most definitely had been an argument in this situation). I could have gone to Toronto to watch the movie but I didn’t want to spend the time (or pay for the gas) to drive down there. I could have gone dancing at a club half an hour south of here with my friend Kari but I knew she would be in the company of a few others whom I really can’t tolerate (drama queens) but I just didn’t have the emotional energy required for them. I could have gone dancing by myself at a club closer to my area but by the time I had even thought about going it was quite late so I parked my ass on the couch and stayed home instead.
Orthodox Jews seem to claim that God made a covenant with them as a nation, as a particular genetic group or race. I doubt that. From Moses on right through the Hebrew prophets, Yahveh (the name of God in the Hebrew Bible, sometimes translated as "Jehovah" in English Bibles) poured out imprecations and condemnations on the Israelites if they strayed from the true religion. It would seem clear that Yahveh defined his people by their RELIGION rather than by their race.
I think that roughly 80% of the population is going through some kind of empathic awakening. It is one of the sixth senses and allows us to gain a better understanding of what are fellow journeyers are going through. It helps us to develop compassion. It is a shift symptom, or ascension symptom, or perhaps I should say a reward. As we learn that others can feel our feelings and thoughts, we (as a species) will begin to clean ourselves up. It is the result of our evolutionary shifts.
In the same way that it has somehow become acceptable to dress like a bumble bee/hooker on Halloween, it has become equally a part of our culture that on New Years Eve, we put on fancy dresses with sparkles, go out to drink our weight in Korbel, and snog some rando.

Chanel blushes don’t really need much introduction as they practically have a cult following by now. This particular shade was released earlier this year as an Asia Exclusive item, and of course promptly sold out at my local counters.

But thankfully, I managed to snag this from DFS on my transit in Hong Kong earlier!

Second, you need to admit the possibility of miracles occurring. And I say that on this basis: if there is a God—infinite, eternal, all-powerful, who created the universe and established the physical laws that govern it—then that God has the power to intervene and make something happen that is different from those physical laws. You don’t have to agree up front that this has ever happened; you just need to allow for the possibility that it could happen, if he ever wanted to. So, no excluding miracles as impossible.
I think my kids clothes has a magnet to attract stains, spills and dirt!! I have tried different laundry soaps, but nothing works as well as Baby Harmony's Laundry soap! It got my kids clothes cleaned on the first wash, which to me is Fabulous, because my kids play hard and you can definitely tell by their clothes. The Laundry soap is 3X concentrated, so a little goes a long way, And is safe for HE wahsers! This is also great with stains, just apply directly to the stain and wait 5 to 10 minutes before washing! This Laundry soap leaves your clothes fresh clean and fragrant free!! And is extra gentle on my kids sensitive skin!!

Of course, everyone assures Rocky he cannot win. The audience was expecting that conflict. What we were wondering is whether Rocky wants to kill Drago in the ring, just beat him up, or feels like he ought to die as penance for Apollo. It is hard to tell because the script never quite decides whether rocky is fighting for Apollo, America, or himself. Everyone has their own theory, so your enjoyment hinges on how well you think the film played out your theory.

Next feature to decide..... how should we be turning this thing on and off? The switch can show up in many places, but typically in one of two. Either on the end cap opposite the lens, or on the body of the flashlight just behind the lens bell (like Granddads flashlight). 'Tactical' flashlights normally have the switch on the end cap, and for good reason. In this placement the user can palm the light, while turning it on and off at will with the thumb; Quickly, easily, almost instinctively. It's an end cap switch that Carteach favors.

Our Saturday morning show, Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey, was disappointingly lacking in the young folk hoped for as part of the DocFest just past or the Lumiere in SF or Rafael Film Center in San Rafael come December 16th. Or, as my wife suggested, perhaps the kids didn't want the magic of Elmo ruined by seeing the man behind him. The man that brought a voice and aesthetic to Elmo that no other puppeteers were able to bring, Kevin Clash, definitely makes an effort to move his body away whenever he meets kids in real life, as if his contortions are abracadabra gesticulations maintaining the magic. The film is about a dreamer, a geek picked on at school, who works hard at his craft and eventually makes his way to the big leagues as well as the respect of his peers. His parents support is endearing and tantamount to Clash's success, as is the public funding that contributed to Clash's career trajectory. Besides the public television funding that made Sesame Street successful along with the massive research and talent that was part of the Children's Television Workshop that Clash became a part of, military research has a place to play in a particularly puzzling aspect of professional puppetry for young Clash. (I'm going to be vague about it to allow for the pleasure of that reveal.) The public money behind Elmo provided opportunities for artists and researchers to leverage their interests, skills, talents and dreams, resulting in tremendous benefit for individuals, communities and economies. If you're cynical to the joy Elmo has brought to so many children, Elmo did, after all, do more than tickle the economy in all the ancillary products sold.

Now for the accounting... I haven't done well on this challenge. I went into it a little sure of myself maybe and didn't start out with the effort that I should have. I was thrown off by the loss of the scale that had seen me through my weight loss journey up until that point. It was not an auspicious beginning and it set the tone for the entire challenge for me. I was basically trying only to maintain and lose just a few pounds to reach my lowest weight but instead I self sabotaged. I have gained more than I ever expected to lose. My weight for today is at 196. I don't have the heart to take measurements. I know I am supposed to include a photo of my challenge outfit or of my progress. As I have made no progress, I am going to skip the photo and just go on from here. I feel like there is a lot of pressure on my shoulders right now and that is contributing to the eating problems. I need to stop with the pressure and just do what worked for me before. I need to take it slow and not be discouraged when the weight doesn't fall off rapidly. It will take some real effort from here on out.

There was a lot of really helpful input but I’ll try not to make this miles long (: I definitely don’t feel like I’m the only one struggling with this but I do feel like I need to refocus and re-evaluate where I want to go and how I want to go about it. I want to really figure out what I want to create, and to really focus on branding. I’m leaning towards creating a second shop to shift some things over (particularly the black and white skull work) but I think this may take more time and thought to figure out. I feel like I’m a lot more than what’s in that shop right now and I really want to express that in my art.

In a novel, there are many conflicts. Characters can be in conflict with each other, they can be in conflict with the environment, they can be in conflict with themselves. As disparate as these conflicts seem, in essence they are the same. Characters wants something and someone or something is preventing them from getting it. The greater the forces keeping the characters from fulfilling their desires, the greater the conflict, and hence the greater the tension. Time constraints add urgency to a conflict, and become a source for conflict themselves, as when one character needs (desires) to rescue another before a bomb goes off.

Trevor Philips, the leader of the Human Rights and Equalities Commission, has stated that Britain is the most tolerant country in the world for a non-white to live in. I agree with him, but I do wish he would go the extra mile and highlight the genuine, virulent racism directed at the indigenous whites by non-whites, the ruling elites and the MSM.
The book itself is intended to support SOA developers rather than SOA architects, SOA designers or SOA analysts. In a mature environment the latter roles would probably have a say regarding the methods and approaches used for SOA development and service implementation. For example, the output of the SOA designer in the form of service contracts or implementation designs is an important input for a SOA Developer. So therefore, one criticism I do have of the book is that these role relationships and the dependency and interaction between them is not reflected strongly enough.

Although it is certainly possible there are Wels catfish in Lake Windermere, what Mr. Burnip saw and described is nothing like a catfish. He is adamant that he saw head and two humps and this is certainly not an aspect that one could possibly expect a catfish to exhibit. Richard Freeman and the gang from the Centre for Fortean Zoology (CFZ) in Devon, also checked out the lake, as I did, after Mr. Burnip’s sighting and they hypothesized what Mr. Burnip saw might have been a large sterile eel. Now, that is a hypothesis I could live with. It is possible that Mr. Burnip saw an eel swimming on its side (this does happen and I have seen footage of it myself) which would account for the creature. It would have to be a very large eel to be 15 – 20 feet long, but it is a possibility with some merit to it.

The Jakarta Post elaborates, pointing out that "objects recently found underneath cold lava," thus "requiring archeologists to use remote sensing equipment to find them," remain physically ambiguous when they cannot be directly excavated. Indeed, "the equipment cannot determine precisely whether rock is part of a temple construction or not." In some cases, then, it's a question of forensic interpretation.
Happy Independence Day.
Did you know you can curl the SAB ribbon? That's right...just like you would gift wrap ribbon! Pull it between your thumb and a pair of scissors several times until you get the amount of curl you want. Since there was a lot going on with the flowers on this card, I opted for a few curls of ribbon, rather than The Bow.

My faculty advisor encouraged me to base my Nassar paper on how much he followed the imperatives outlined in Huntington's book for the leaders of developing countries to stay in power. The idea was that they in order to enact change they must stay in power. But we all know that this is not necessarily always the case; Egypt's Mubarek stayed in power for three decades and little changed. Reading the accounts of the power struggles after the fall of Mubarek, it's like reading my Master's paper again; the military, the Islamic Brotherhood-- all the same players.

We got married at Historic Locust Grove in Louisville, KY. It was a beautiful and perfect location. We made a stop by after brunch to take a walk around the grounds and took this pic of ourselves. Not bad for an iPhone!
I came out of the subway on the way home and knew immediately from the yellow tape and blocked streets that someone was dead. In the next glance I saw the towering microwave antennae of the local news trucks.

We visit a lot of churches on our bike trips. Normally my interest is in the history and architecture of the building and I am not typically very emotionally involved. But seeing the tomb of Cardinal Josef Mindszenty, who had spent fifteen years living in the U.S. Embassy in Budapest in order to avoid being imprisoned by the Communists, and who was finally exiled to Vienna, where he died and was then entombed in the Esztergom basilica, was very moving. The building itself is immense and very impressive but I would not have been as moved as I was without the Cardinal Minszenty connection.

So the way I cook is this… you can think of it one of two ways, I am either lazy or efficent and smart. I only use one bowl when I bake. I don’t use a separate one for dry and wet. First I mix all the wet together with a spatula. I then put the flour in a pile on top of the wet. I add the rest of the dry on top of the flour and lightly mix together before mixing with the wet. This way I only have one bowl to wash. I also stir with my spatula so I can scrape every last bit of batter out at the end withouth messing up another utensil. And for this recipe I only used my 1/4 cup measuring cup. I just took 2 scoops when I needed 1/2 cup. So that is how I cook. I like to minimize dishes because although i love to cook and bake, i do not enjoy dishes. So am I lazy? yep. efficient? I think so!

We spent a long time yesterday cleaning out the front raised reds, pulling out lettuce and greens that were done and planting more seedlings. We've got lots of chard, kale, beets and carrots starting. I sowed lettuce and radishes yesterday. I still consider this an experimental year, so we'll see how well things do started now. I do know for sure we need to organize our plantings much better next year, also that we'll plant way fewer tomatoes since they took up a lot of space and haven't produced much.
In St. Paul, is there a finer example of a local bookstore than Common Good Books, about to celebrate its fifth birthday soon. You may have heard of the proprietor, a Mr. Garrison Keillor. Shareology has been hearing the phrase “multiple income streams” lately, a phrase Mr. Keillor practically invented. Let’s take a tour of this local bookstore, tucked away in the basement of 165 Western Avenue at Selby in St. Paul:
I will always remember this journey.
The more schooling Americans get, however, the more politically ignorant they are of America’s ongoing class war, and the more incapable they are of challenging the ruling class. In the 1880s and 1890s, American farmers with little or no schooling created a Populist movement that organized America’s largest-scale working people’s cooperative, formed a People’s Party that received 8 percent of the vote in 1892 presidential election, designed a “subtreasury” plan (that had it been implemented would have allowed easier credit for farmers and broke the power of large banks) and sent 40,000 lecturers across America to articulate it, and evidenced all kinds of sophisticated political ideas, strategies and tactics absent today from America’s well-schooled population. Today, Americans who lack college degrees are increasingly shamed as “losers”; however, Gore Vidal and George Carlin, two of America’s most astute and articulate critics of the corporatocracy, never went to college, and Carlin dropped out of school in the ninth grade.

Oh yeah – The less said about Microsoft selling “$99″ Xbox 360/Kinect bundles the better, but here goes. Sure, treat your console like a cell phone, lower the price point to one where a new user going in blind will JUMP out the nearest window and run to their favorite game shop to snap one up. That’s the good part for both parties… at first. But it’s when you stop and think for a minute that this idea is lousy and worth shooting down fast.

He can’t remember a time in his life when he’s enjoyed being in the dark. Not a single time. The darkness hides monsters, demons and otherwise. To enjoy it would go against every ounce of his witch training. To enjoy it would go against his very nature. Still, it seems a nonissue compared to the immense task before him. Initiation for shamanhood would require many things of Mesdan, things he isn’t sure even now he’s ready for. His dream shell is complete and he has the support of Kesta, Thaneen and Eliss to count on, but he still knows that it will be dreadfully difficult. With that knowledge haunting him, he tries his best to find his center now. He doesn’t know and won’t be told who will administer the initiation. Kesta only tells him things like that because the two of them are close. Much closer than they should be, to be frank. Thaneen would be jealous if he knew. But there are some things Thaneen can never understand.

That led to Dan’s first emergency surgery, a procedure to block the damage artery on his left side. Dan was told that he lost 65 percent of his blood volume during the ordeal. He finally returned home, grateful to have survived a major threat to his life. It worked for only four days. The block became dislodged and he started bleeding again.

The purpose of this beer is by all accounts to give the loyal Foster’s drinker something more sophisticated for when times demand an occasion, as the can of lout is okay when you’re with your mates but not in front of a lady. That’s what the marketing department say, anyway. I asked the squeeze. “Do I look sexier with a bottle of lager or a can of lager?” The answer was “You look sexiest when you are hoovering. But not during Emmerdale. You want to do that more often if you want to turn me on”
MACD 21/63/21 is also beginning to flare bullishly where a clear divergence increase could lead into a ADX/DMI 11-period bullish cross on a higher level than the bearish one, thus forcing a relatively sustained push higher on technicals. The MACD situation though would forecast volatility increases given how far into bullish trend the entire package is and previous price action around the HK$20+ level. Trampolining off the slowest upwards trend line doesn’t help much, given its previous volatility profile and the ~HK$19 consolidation in the past three weeks.

Something happened March 13, when a woman, hired to dance at a private party, alleged that three lacrosse players sexually assaulted her in a bathroom for 30 minutes.
I’d basically reward the players for balancing their use of the two characters in the pair with extra power to their attacks, or bonus points at the end of the level to spend on stuff. Can’t get into the specifics of the system I have in mind for privacy reasons, but people in my inner circle have noted that the specifics are weird/interesting, with some noting that it could be annoying, so I need to find a way to make it work without being intrusive.
Penny didn't wake up until 4:15 (Horray!). This gave me almost 6 hours of uninterrupted sleep. I fed her and then realized I should try to get a few things knocked off my to do list while both girls are sleeping. I just felt so tired and emotionally spent yesterday. I don't know how this reads, but it was a fairly average day. Tuesdays I have my mommy's group from my church (which I LOVE) and a creative meeting on Tuesday afternoons for my church. I take Penny to that, but my mom watches Macie for that. I was so tired last night that i called my mom and asked her to come over today to help me. I may go to the gym for a little bit and then come back and try to get some laundry done while my mom helps me watch the girls. It's not that I can't get the laundry done,b ut it takes 3 times as long and that makes my mind go crazy.

Indeed, it was for these great deeds that he recieved his knighthood from Richard himself and given the lay of the land. Since that day the family Fuckington had ruled the proles of stickfordshire with a stiff iron rod, often applied in a firm manner without the favour of anointment. With each generation came the story of that great forefather along with his personal effects; a manuscript written in the highest hyperbole telling of his adventures (written by an annoynmous scribe of that era; Roger himself was famous for his illiteracy), a broadsword and his coat of armor emblazoned with the family crest. These keepsakes were passed down the male side of the line, going to the first son of each generation, and often given pride of place in the grand entrance hall of the family home, safely kept in a locked glass cabinet to protect them from curious fingers. The cabinet remained locked on all but the second Sunday of each month during which its contents was cleaned and polished to a brilliant shine.
A very sweet blogging friend, Darlene Schacht of Time-Warp Wife and New York Time best selling author, asked if I would write a review for her book "The Good Wife's Guide". I of course agreed! :) The book's title alone had me sold. Those of you that know me, know that I have a strong desire to be the helpmeet God created me to be. When I saw the words "Enhancing Your Role as a Helpmeet" under the title, I knew I had to read it.
But his wandering eye has spread beyond cars to other vehicles. He says that his most intense sexual experience was “making love” to the helicopter from 1980s TV hit Airwolf.
I didn't know what to expect and in my mind, I was really going as a support to a friend. I did not realize the impact it would have on me and what an eye opening experience it would be to attend. Not to mention, it was so much fun. The classes were helpful and entertaining. They ranged from Photoshop basics to how to succeed in a blog business.
I've been meaning to post the second part of the Brewers' Journal article on American oak for some time. But, as you know, I'm easily distracted. I think it's worth the wait. Because it's another piece in a jigsaw I've been trying to finish for a couple of years.
The French are anti-germophobic. They’re pro-germ. Their attitude is laissez-le germe. It’s genuinely sickening (in that I’ve been sick more often). People here don’t bother covering their noses and mouths when they sneeze. They have no compunction about wiping their noses with their hands and then grabbing a subway pole. Seeing this kind of behavior activates my gag reflex and makes me want to go home and boil myself.

Easter was fun this year since we now have family that live nearby to help us celebrate. Easter was all about the eggs this year. We were joined by cousins Nash and Haven in our egg dyeing, egg rolling, egg hunting, and egg eating.
Almost two hours into the attack, the hot tempered general was given permission to move forward in support of Confederate troops advancing on their right. Barksdale ordered his men to the eastern edge of the woods where the Mississippians dressed their ranks and went to the position of "parade rest" while Union shells burst around them. Though considered a senior in age, General Barksdale was a fiery and fearless leader in battle whose face appeared to "glow with excitement at the prospect of battle." Dressed in a resplendent gray officer's coat highlighted with gold trim, his long gray hair flowing almost to the collar, Barksdale spurred his black charger to the front of his old regiment, the 13th Mississippi. Above the noise of battle, the general spoke a few words of encouragement. He then waved his hat as a signal to begin the charge and his brigade moved forward in an unstoppable wave.

This is the day I brought her home.. a 1979 Montgomery Wards Open Road 3 speed. The bike was a little rough with non working brakes and shifter, a rusted chain, and severely oxidized paint. However, if you could look past all of that.. you'd see a bike with great bones.
Like all humans, he was imperfect. He could be boorish, especially with a reservoir of amber restorative under his belt. He was occasionally (but not usually) too pugnacious. He could be paternalistic in some of his remarks about women. And I wasn’t too keen on his jihad against Bill Clinton or his support of the Iraq war. The latter has occupied most of his detractors, but remember that it was one political position among many. I opposed his stance on that largely because he seemed to be giving us license to go into any country whose regime we didn’t like and forcibly remove it—and casualties be damned. But if he approved going into Iraq, why not North Korea, a far worse regime? Or any of the other dozens of oppressive dictatorships throughout the world? I wasn’t too hard on Hitch about this, though, because I knew that he was motivated largely by compassion for his friends in Iraq and his hatred of totalitarianism. But yes, in my view his stand was wrong.

He then gave me a really, really abbreviated version that went something like this: “I initiated things, we had very inappropriate sexual conversations, and we talked about everything you can imagine.” The end. I said that I really would like to know more – what does that mean, how did it happen, when, for how long (I think about a month, but a lot of what he told me were lies back then), what types of things… And what were lies and what was the truth in the story he told me? He admitted that he lied when he said he knew her, that the whole story was completely made-up. However, anytime I pressed for more details about the REAL story all he would say is that he doesn’t remember.
the reality is that the Atlantic Yards project has already done the very thing that critics feared and supporters promoted: transform surrounding neighborhoods prized for their streets of tree-lined brownstones and low-key living. Was an arena really needed to accelerate retail along Flatbush Avenue? How about a rezoning of the few blocks zoned industrial and an effort to market the Vanderbilt Yard? (Streetsblog nails it: "NYT Mistakes Ongoing Gentrification of Brooklyn for Atlantic Yards Effect.")
She then reeled off about five occasions when we had been to the theatre together. And another occasion when we had both gone to see Sylvester McCoy perform on stage. (Obviously, at the time of writing this blog, I cannot remember what that second play was.)
The food at breakfast was really good. I had miso soup with tofu & scallions, pancakes, rice/meatballs, sausage, watermelon, cantalope, dragon fruit, dim sum, 1 bite of eggs, coffee, OJ. I did not really like the eggs and sausage. I liked everything else. Especially the miso soup.

Additionally, it’s important to notice that when HB1534 was “perfected” in the Missouri House several days ago (with a vote of 109 to 49) – there weren’t any amendments offered. This also is encouraging, as it means that the preferred language, consisting of a Jeffersonian style nullification of Obamacare (along with the arrest of federal officials who attempt to enforce Obamacare), was retained in the bill.

I love the gorgeous shape of these! The boy is nestled on the middle layer, only seen when the mats are flipped to look at the interior treasures. To create a sparkly sky background, I colored it with blue Copics and then coated it in Stardust Stickles. I cut out pieces of sparkling white cardstock and embossed it to add some texture to the lovely ornament design. To coordinate with the silvery photo mats, I used silver Stickles for accents and hung the ornament on heavyweight silver thread. (I forgot the actual word.)

And last but not least, a big thanks to Mouse, my first sweet and gentle giant. He has no concept of his size, and as he matured, he had no concept of his age (you'll be getting a glimpse of what I mean later on). As a veteran now, he still looks and acts like a 6 month old goofball. Thank you to Mouse for being incredibly tolerant, incredibly patient, and incredibly forgiving as my first dog. I can't even begin to count the number of times I've made mistakes with you, and you just kept on trucking.

What I love about this sauce, besides the amazing burst of cranberry flavor, is that it is baked, freeing up one of my burners. And as you know, stove-top space is at a premium during the holidays. The cranberries are simply sprinkled, smothered rather, with sugar (is it just me or have you found that the cranberries are especially tart this year?), then baked for awhile until their crimson juices run and the cranberries have softened like jellies. Mmmmm, tastes like Christmas, indeed!

Basically it’s time to welcome our extraterrestrial star family to our surface, to assist us to bring balance back into the surface of our planet. We can do so with peace in our heart… and love for all… even those who trespass against us… there’s no payoff to fear, but more fear… so let’s continue to know, because we are coming into God knowing… with love for all… even clones… we thank all for the lessons… as we create an alternative reality… a reality where each human and all beings are each in control of our individual and collective destinies. Specifically clarify with Source on this matter… what improvements to the situation would you want to share.

All of these groups purport to denounce one-stateism. And they'll do it, when the promoters are some fringe academics or lunatic activists. But none of them have the guts to take it on when it presents itself as an actual threat -- from U.S. Congressmen, from major political players, from folks with money and power and influence. In other words, none of them are ready to defend Israel when it matters. It's pathetic.

You have the kind of willpower that’s often mistaken for stubbornness. You don’t think of yourself as dogged, but your honest beliefs and that ever-direct speech makes you come across as completely unremitting. Once you’ve made a decision, you follow it through to the conclusion—right, wrong, or indifferent. You’re set in your ways and determined to handle things the way you feel they should be handled. Your tenacity of purpose and ability to get the job done, borders on obsession. You’re a wonderful manager with a great sense of how to get the job done.

After they dried again three were pressed gently onto light bulbs so they would dome and curve and the other five were baked flat. Come back this weekend to see what I do with them. I am not sure yet what the next step will be. All in all it was a very fun and productive day!!
I picked up this cosy wartime romance in a charity shop years ago, and forgot that I'd even got it until yesterday, when I wanted a break from the doom and gloom of Panem. I have little time for romance, whether that be Mills and Boon, or chick lit, but occasionally I'll make an exception for a sweet story from the "granny" section of the bookstore, wartime romances, family sagas, usually seeming to take place in World War 2 Liverpool. Wish Me Luck is the story of Fleur, a WAAF (women's branch of the Royal Air Force) girl who falls in love with an RAF officer. Their relationship is marred, not only by the dangers of being in love during wartime, but by their parents, whose own pasts are intertwined by secrets long gone but never forgotten.
Scripture makes it clear that without the inspiration of the Paraclete, the soul (our mind, emotions and will), if left to its own natural capabilities, is not capable of understanding Gods will or understanding His Word.
I excitedly brought my lavender home from the trip, and dried the flowers according to Deborah's instructions - tied in bunches and hung upside down in a dark room (to preserve the vivid color of the lavender). After they had dried for a week or so, I hand-plucked all the buds from the stems, and stored them in glass jars.

We’ve started grilling Sundays…every Sunday we grill. Veggies, burgers, chicken, etc. (list goes on but I’ll spare ya). It sets us up for the week so we can spend more time after work at the park or on long walks with the Foster de Jour, instead of slaving in the kitchen (not that I don’t love being in the kitchen… I actually do love it). Well that’s neither here nor there. The point is, girlfriend likes to grill too. In the kitchen, she stakes out a place on her mat, and calmly observes the prepping, chopping, stirring and dicing. But, outside? The aroma she just can’t get enough of.

Scotswood Bridge carried the traffic of the Gateshead A1 western by-pass from 1970 up until the construction of Blaydon Bridge in 1990. Between June 1971 and January 1974 traffic on the bridge was limited to single file to enable strengthening work to take place, which was needed to address design concerns. It has required further strengthening and repairs a number of times since; between 1979 and 1980, in 1983 and in 1990.

A rapid knock-knock-knock snapped me out of my reverie. Mike--donning a crisp, sparkling lab coat--strode into the room; my brown file tucked under his arm.

I can’t comment on any other romance subplots in the game as I have to do more playthroughs of this series to determine how the others are, but I can say I’m completely satisfied with how the romance between my female Shepard and Kaidan has played out in this game. A faithful Shepard since the first Mass Effect is definitely worth having for this romance. A lot of the romance scenes and dialogue choices between Shepard and Kaidan is worthy of any romantic or fangirl who has been in love with Kaidan since the first game. The emotions feel genuine, and the credit definitely goes to the voice actors for selling the romance to the player well. It also doesn’t hurt that the developers have improved on the look of Kaidan as well.
Tim Burton’s Dark Shadows works best – for a short while, anyway -- as a comedy of manners in which a 200-year old vampire struggles to understand life and etiquette in the year 1972. He mistakes McDonalds for Mephistopheles, rock star Alice Cooper for the world’s “ugliest woman,” and judges sexy women by the size and shape of their “birthing” hips. He doesn’t know about cars, roads, television, female doctors, psychiatry, or even Erich Segal’s Love Story (1970).

I was a bit skeptical because they are so cheap, so I started doing some research and found that every single review that I read about them was positive. There were some people that, like us, got rid of all of their expensive diapers and converted strictly to Sunbaby.
One other truth is that LOST totally changed my life and my life will never be the same. Yes, all aspects of my life even down to my ringtone (which is You All Everybody) and the fact that I only play 4-8-15-16-23-42 in the weekly lottery. Believe me, there are many other fun LOST bits and serious LOST bits that are incorporated into my daily life.
Subject to individual country laws, a licensee does not have sublicensing rights unless the agreement authorizes them. Should the parties agree to allow sublicensing, the main agreement should specify the rights and obligations of the licensor and licensee with respect to the sublicensee(s). it is usually obvious that granting sublicensing rights is good business for the licensor and licensee. When the benefits are unclear for the licensor, but the licensee wants sublicensing rights, the licensee should prepare and present a market plan to persuade the licensor.

I pottered around my house tidying up (now I’ve found my floor again, I’m keen to keep it), went to the post office to post some of the #ninjamail & then went to Woolworths. Doing grocery trips more regularly but of smaller amounts is more manageable for me. It’s easier to carry home & I don’t get as stressed when I’m there for a short amount of time. I’m trying to work with myself, instead of against myself. I bought some up&go & soup. Trying to keep up the mammoth effort I’ve been putting in. It’s hard. My main motivation is that I do not want to end up in the public unit. If I get scheduled for refusing to eat; which has been a threat of recent times, then I won’t have a say in being out of the ward & I’m desperate to maintain my control & dignity.

Bombing eventually sunk the ship and the oil slick was finally dispersed by favourable weather. By then tens of thousands of seabirds had been killed, together with huge numbers of marine organisms including all fish within a 75 mile radius. The resultant oil release coated miles of Cornish beach in brown sludge, in what was then the world’s worst environmental disaster. The slick stretched along hundreds of kilometres of the south coast of Britain and Normandy, killing most of the marine life it touched and blighting the areas for over a decade after. When I was living and working in Cornwall six years later, football-sized lumps of crude oil were still sweeping ashore from the wreck.

Another unexpected outcome of Frank’s Mod Madness entry: He has an admirer. He caught the eye and the fancy of Tome of the Ancient’s female Undead Warlock, and she’s been longing for him ever since. Poor TotA has had no peace, what with all the crying and the pining away, but all efforts to convince the young lady to approach Frank have failed. She’s just too shy to make the first move. So I agreed that I would pass the message on to Frank and see if I could convince him to pay her a visit.

ONCE UPON A TIME, a little boy loved a stuffed animal whose name was Old Rabbit. It was so old, in fact, that it was really an unstuffed animal; so old that even back then, with the little boy’s brain still nice and fresh, he had no memory of it as “Young Rabbit,” or even “Rabbit”; so old that Old Rabbit was barely’ a rabbit at all but rather a greasy hunk of skin without eyes and ears, with a single red stitch where its tongue used to be. The little boy didn’t know why he loved Old Rabbit he just did, and the night he threw it out the car window was the night he learned how to pray. He would grow up to become a great prayer, this little boy, but only intermittently, only fitfully, praying only when fear and desperation drove him to it, and the night he threw Old Rabbit into the darkness was the night that set the pattern, the night that taught him how. He prayed for Old Rabbit’s safe return, and when, hours later, his mother and father came home with the filthy, precious strip of rabbity roadkill, he learned not only that prayers are sometimes answered but also the kind of severe effort they entail, the kind of endless frantic summoning. And so when he threw Old Rabbit out the car window the next time, it was gone for good.

I had friends popping around unexpectedly on Friday morning and there was nothing to give them, so I needed a quick, tasty, gluten free biscuit that I could have done and cooling by the time they arrived. I went to my trusty Porridge book and of course good old Margaret Briggs had this recipe for School Dinner Oat Cookies. In a school she worked in years ago they served these with blancmange. How very Enid Blyton! These make a crisp, sweet, chewy biscuit. Impossible to eat just one.

# Sure, an interesting building sometimes gets built but nobody can still look at a modern building without seeing the invisible hand behind it: the cabal of investors, bankers, estate-agents, crooked industries, all dodgy, all corrupt, all purely self-interested. Housing has ceased to be a basic human right and the simple wish to have a roof over your head means being forced to commit yourself to a pyramid scheme where the newcomers will always pay for the exorbitant riches of those who came first. A house is no longer a home but an investment, a city is no longer a society but a marketing ploy to be sold to its inhabitants. Of course you can download a ‘psychogeographic’, ‘Situationist-inspired’ augmented reality app that helps you to forget all this. They cost only 99 cents and will keep you just as
Images like Define Necessity may call attention to the excess surrounding the holidays, but they do nothing to promote change. The notion of slacktivism, that “liking” a status on Facebook, or sharing a picture, makes participants feel good, but those actions have no impact on populations that need help. This may also give an inflated sense of activism, and translate to less action in the form of campaigning, or charitable giving.

Likewise, the Palestinian Freedom Riders recognized that their continued defiance of the system of apartheid practiced in the Occupied Territories is dangerous, and in fact, an act that risks their lives. They are under threat from the violence of Israeli settlers during the rides themselves, as well as arrest and abuse from Israeli Occupation Forces, and yet they held true to their non-violent act of civil disobedience.

I'm also angry. A little at Trooper - for not letting on sooner that there was an issue, and letting me continue to become invested. A little at God - for bringing someone so wonderful into my life, just to take him away. At myself - for not knowing better. I should know this isn't a punishment; that things happen for a reason, even if that reason isn't always clear. I should know this awful feeling is temporary, and will get better.

Birmingham responded with, “that’s a great question right now Nancy and there are a number of things that Tucson Police are not saying right now as far as this investigation goes. Basically, what they are saying is, in fact, that her parents put her down to bed around 11 o’clock – as far as what transpired during that time that remains unclear at this point. As they continue with this investigation they’re saying they do not want to do anything to possibly jeopardize the investigation as it stands now. So, that’s what we are hearing, the family put her to bed and it was the parents who went to check on her the next morning.”

I thought that the author did an incredible job portraying the realm and courts, the physical features of each creature and the different personalities. Since I'd gone into the book knowing some things about the creatures that Julie Kagawa mentioned, it was refreshing to be thrown back into the world after years of drifting away from it. Though it's not the best book I've read including fey, the ending left me wanting more.

We’ve betrayed the ideals for which we fought WWII, and trashed in its infancy the resulting international order which was our nation’s greatest accomplishment. As with Athens, our great accomplishments as a civilization will not help as our enemies proliferate — and the newly emerging great powers (eg, Turkey, Brazil, China) regard us as an unpredictable and potentially hostile nation.

This is strange place, and it is usually when the more sane or less analytic of us turn the television off and leave the theater. However, to discover the weird mechanisms behind our actions and to view the perversions that could emerge from their repressed state if allowed is fascinating. Perhaps for Rauch, the curtained room is something lost, like freedom in his East German upbringing. Who knows? Most of us will never know. Our desires, what we want, usually do not have the status of the big object. Instead, what we usually seek are the ambiguous sundry items on the table outside the curtain. We chase the Griffin.
Colonial Revivals aren't copies of original Colonials; rather they're liberal interpretations of all shapes and sizes, using Colonial details and elements for inspiration. The Colonial Revival style was extremely popular during the early 20th Century and almost always has a front porch, a detailed cornice line, double hung windows, and symmetrical massing. Many new homes that don't fit into other stylistic categories might be best classified as Colonial Revivals.

Now that you have a firm grasp on the principles of building relationships let us look deeper in to the implementation of those principles on a more short term basis and in regards to sales. Remember that short term relationships can be just as meaningful as long term ones because relationships do not have to be permanent to be effective. I’m not talking about your wild nights at the bar here either although many of these principles are interchangeable in a variety of settings. I am only focused on the short term relationships we build to help us make sales outside of the nightclub setting.

To put paid to this question, a 'thing' was constructed. Four 1" thick boards were stacked and bound together.

How much we take the future for granted. How much we assume that we will be around to 'direct' what is ahead of us, that the next career step is precisely that, and we don't spend any time on the possible chasm that may open up in between. We take the future as a given. We take our health, and the health and presence of those closest to us utterly for granted. We probably have to in that if we did think about the potential dangers of all that we do, we would quit in horror; throw our hands up in the air and put up the white flag immediately. After all, the boyfriend could be in a car crash tomorrow, the daughter might get skin cancer from being in the garden, and I could trip down the stairs and break my neck tonight. Already, I am scared stiff and I am still at the computer writing.

It was when I met Patrice that I understood. It was not that Patrice was smart – though he was, of course. It was that he was emotionally honest. He made me realise that a lot of black people were afraid of people like me. Or wary of me? Or leery? Is that the word? Black people were sometimes afraid of me because I represented ‘The Man’ to them. I looked like a successful guy. Maybe it was a class thing. Maybe they thought I was better educated than them. I wore a blue blazer and a white shirt. I always looked neat and moneyed even when I “didn’t have a pot to piss in”, as my father would say.
Better luck next year I suppose?

Which brings us to PaaS (and where the “Robert in the cloud” analogy becomes a little stretched but, in other ways, still can work as an example). PaaS is, sort of, a combination of the other two but with a different objective.

(Force.com from Salesforce and GoogleApps – from a developer point of view, work as examples of PaaS).

I finished off with some stitched ribbon.

The thing that's different about Lint has less to do with the design of the book or the now-familiar formal quirks – unusual panel progression; lettering that leaps up and down in case and wanders across the page – than with the qualities of story itself. For one thing, the eponymous star of the book, Jordan (or Jason) Wellington Lint, isn't your typical Ware sad sack character, prone to endless navel-gazing and intermittent weeping (see Jimmy Corrigan, Rusty Brown). He's deeply damaged, of course – you'd expect nothing less from Ware – but he's more rounded a character than previous Ware stooges: he's a jock and a bully, then a stoner and a dropout, then a husband and a father, and finally a grandfather and father all over again.
She's so close to crawling I wish that I could just do it for her. She gets on her hands and knees now and try's to figure out what she can do so that she doesn't have to crawl!

Twelve years ago I was at Reseach Hospital in KC MO welcoming my bouncing baby boy into the world. I was welcoming him alone. I had my parents at my side but my husband was miles away. He was deployed, yet again, missing the moment of our baby's birth. I went into labor in the night and emailed my husband on board the USS Kearsarge. I figured what more could bug him but to receive an email from me saying I was enroute to the hospital... yep he is not a patient man. I figured it would be several hours before he got any communication from my family letting him know about the birth of his son. This is pre cell phones!!! I was so mean....LOL

As for Goals I prefer to set 3 kinds a long-term a mid-term and NOW goal. Long term to me means I set a time and a weight that will take me a while to reach but not necessarily my end goal (that is just too much to think about right now) Midterm to me is set a goal about half-way between now and long-term so that it shows progress along the way….the Now goal is small goals I set that I can accomplish along the way just to show myself that it is making a difference as I go

Mr Seth Paul’s daughter, Theodara Van Hein, renovated the building in 1933 and it became the Oranje Hotel. During World War Two, in February 1942, survivors of the Prince of Wales and Repulse recuperated at the Oranje Hotel before the Japanese forces occupied Singapore and used the building as a hotel. After the war, shops occupied the ground floor and the upper levels were rented out.

aren't words such a powerful thing? a persons words could change someones life. Or in a more settle way, a persons words could change someones day. whether it be in a good way or a bad way. you know, i laughed just a little to myself when i thought hard about this today..i can decide whether i want to hold on to words, or if i want to let them go. I can decide, it is MY choice. but yet, words still have such a huge influence in a persons life. for example, today i was talking with a few girly friends and some words that came out of one of their mouths have not left my head. i cannot stop thinking about them and it totally turned my night around. and no, these words werent good words, but they werent said in a way that was meant to be bad. I guess i just took them in a way that i really shouldnt have because i'm sure if she knew that it totally impacted my night then she would feel horrible. and thats when i giggle. i giggle because to me, those words were very bold but to her, they were light. and this is why i decided to write this post. because i feel that if i write out my feelings and let them out, then i wont hold them in any longer.

These days there are MANY different books, videos, and classes you can invest in to learn the secrets of signing, but the basic premise on which they are all built: speaking is a physiologically-complex task that requires the coordination of several fine motor skills (movements of the tongue and lips, breath control, vocal cord tension, etc.), while signing uses only gross motor skills of the hands and arms. Believe it or not, as soon as you are able to make & maintain eye contact with your baby (generally 2-3 months), you can start teaching them to sign! It’s important to note that most babies won’t begin to sign back to you until they are 8-10 months; however,.
And frankly, I'm annoyed at the arrogance of a nation who think it's ok to invade another sovereign country and assassinate someone. Because lets face it, that is what it was. There was no intention of taking him alive. I find it hard to believe that big strong navy Seals couldn't overpower him when he refused to surrender. And I find it rather distateful that the US Commander in Chief sat and watched video feeds of the killing. How is that justice? Snuff movies maybe! Justice, no way!

You know that whole thing about how some moments in pop mean as much in our current climate as they did then? "One of the most influential groups of individuals to come to this country. For the very first time, we present the men from the International Monetary Fund." No it isn't, it's Legs & Co in suits, another full covering after the Grandma's Party cameo which brings the mean average of body cover up after the Maid In Heaven skinfest. In which of Flick's fevered imaginings did she see old-school stereotypical City banker's suits - no umbrellas, mark you - as the best interpretation of prime Wonder, unless they were ordered in for a Money Money Money runthrough that was ditched when the video arrived? Actually, they begin with a Charlie Chaplin walk, which may have been the true intention, in which case it's even more inexplicable. Just to add a further layer of end of year madness, there's a screen behind them onto which is projected a seventh dancer, clearly masculine, strutting his own independent disco moves. He even gets a shadowy solo. What's that about? In fact... ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back to Top Of The Pops, albeit in reduced circumstances, your becostumed friend and mine Mr Floyd Pearce! You'll see him a few more times in 1977 and 1978 too.

Gaining such confidence in herself has inspired Alyssa to become very involved with her local community. She serves as a 4H mentor to sixth graders, works as a Student Teacher and America Reads Tutor, and is Treasurer of the Service Club at SUU. She is also President of the American Sign Language Club, and is a member of both the Anthropology Club and the Research team within the Michael Leavitt Center for Politics.

"Yeah! I guess so, MOM. I never know what's going on. Everyone else in my class always knows this stuff and I don't. You didn't even tell me about Egypt - Dad did. But this is even bigger than Egypt, and you guys didn't tell me!" Molly is unrelenting; apologies have never carried much weight with her. (She's a Scorpio, like me. We are unforgiving and we sting.)
The newly released military personnel got back to Britain okay, and I'm eagerly awaiting the press conference in which one of them recants everything they said on Iranian TV, and says: "The Persians were a lot more valid when they were worshipping fire and chucking their dead to the vultures. Now that they're Muslim, they're a collection of cunts."

Hamas leader Khaled Mash’al: The support we got from Sheik Al-Qaradhawi is different from the support of anybody else, because of his religious status, his status in terms of morale, and his ability to draw the attention of the nation and the world to the issues of the nation, particularly the issue of Palestine. This support was of great value to us, to the Palestinian people, in the first and second Intifadas, and in all matters pertaining to the Palestinian cause. He has publicly declared his support for the resistance factions, unequivocally and without any hesitation or embarrassment, without fawning over anyone. From day one to the present, the sheik, may Allah reward him, has not hesitate to support the Jihad and the resistance, and to support the fighters, and the resistance factions. One of the most notable manifestations of this support was when we relied – after Allah – on his support of martyrdom operations. He never hesitated to issue rulings in support of these operations, and there were times when we were in dire need of these rulings.
Ideally I would confine my computers to the gite where they would have their own space in which to hum and buzz and interfere with the air waves, and I would walk out of the conservatory, past the sweetest smelling roses, across the lawn and into the gite to work. Kind of like the old mainframe machine rooms of my early career in which great blinking beasts were safely secured behind glass and key-pad locks and threatened with Halon gas should they get over-heated.
Having active vision is definitely what I’m advocating in this post. It is never wise to be a shallow person(passive vision) because you tend to take things as they are without questioning the motives and rationale behind doing them(things).
This is an Asian pickled. This pickle is pretty common in Asian cuisine. Most countries have their own version but cooking method is similar, 1:1 ratio of white vinegar:sugar. It can be served as a Korean banchan too. I tried to use less sugar and the result was less satisfactory as it leans toward sourish.
For those of you sewing the Colette Negroni pattern, you may want to choose a more casual fabric -- a print, say, or a small plaid, or even flannel. You'll see there's plenty on offer at the sites listed above. I'd stick to 100% cotton.
This is all of the homebrewing equipment that takes over the kitchen. Since our kitchen is the size of a large walk-in closet, it's best if I leave Mike and his stuff alone during his brewing. That means for about 4 hours every couple of weeks our kitchen is completely out of commission to me. Mike says it's mostly due to the contamination factor, but he allows the cat to go in and out whenever he pleases, so I think it's just that he doesn't want me in his way asking a million questions and moving stuff around.

Nick Courtright’s collection of poems, Punchline, has been published by Gold Wake Press and is a riveting read. Nick Courtright was born in Ohio and currently lives and teaches in Austin, Texas and is also the interviews editor for the Austinest. His work has appeared in journals including The Southern Review, the Boston Review, and his chapbook, Elegy, has been published by Blue Hour Press. Punchline is a philosophical collection of poems that reaches into the large and the small, from the universe down to the atom. It is a living, breathing collection and I am happy to share a few poems with you:
In later life, I struggled with binge eating, and with binge exercising, running on an injury to the point of needing surgical repair. I could not tell what was enough. I never felt that I was enough in any situation, always over-preparing my classes when I was teaching at the university, always having to read more, and buy more books about any topic I need to study. In fact, I had so many unread books at one time that I made a tidy sum selling them on Amazon. (Not as much as I’d spent originally, of course.)

In a large skillet, heat butter over medium heat. Add onions, cook until translucent, about 5 minuets. Add about half of the spinach, as much as fits in the skillet, and toss with tongs until it starts to wilt. Add remaining spinach and toss until wilted, about 2 to 3 minutes. Season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.
But God knows we're human. He made us. I have to pour out my heart to Him about how angry I am with the situation. I ask Him what to do. When I open up to Him, I do feel peace at times. I also have to let go of myself -- wanting to be pregnant took up so much of my life. It's a very selfish mindset. It's been me for so long, wanting it, wanting it, wanting it. I feel like God is saying "no". I feel like I need to let go of what I want and somehow find contentment in that. But I don't want to many days. I have to let go of myself and my wants over and over and over everyday.

FEELINGS are inborn environmental and interpersonal relationship responses, a means of survival. In alcoholic and/or abusive homes, a child becomes confused and desperate when he/she is told s/he doesn’t hurt, when he does; that he/she is happy when s/he is sad, etc. S/he learns to deny or repress the unacknowledged feelings.

Grimes’s academic background as an English college professor is evident in her fondness for literary allusions.

“Après moi le déluge” is attributed to the French king, Louis XV (1710-1774) who bankrupted his nation and would cost his grandson, Louis XVI, his head in a revolution (1789-1799) that went so badly that Napolean eventually took over and annointed himself Emperor. If only Barack Hussein Obama had the old king’s grasp of economics and history.

But some progress was being made. I rewrote passages. I edited and revised. I changed the title to The Making of Her. I worked on making it more upbeat and changed one of the main narratives to first person. I subbed to another handful of agents. The rejections continued to come in, but now some of them were personal, and encouraging. One agent rejected, but asked to see the next one. A couple more asked for the full. There were moments of hope, but many more moments of despair and dejection. One agent ‘loved’ the first 50 pages and asked for the full, then hung onto it for many months before sending a pretty brutal rejection.

I snapped back to reality as I took my car to my dad’s city parking garage. Mine was the only vehicle on the fourth floor and the emptiness of the giant space gave me the creeps. I took the stairs down and headed away from the courthouse. My heart thudded in my chest; I half-expected to be jumped from behind at any moment. My head spun around so much in every direction I felt like an owl.

Though it looks otherworldly, this is not an orphaned postcard from some distant planet. It is a very close view of fossils in the Pech Merle cave in the Midi-Pyrénées region of France.

We’re little more than wallets and their interests lie in calibrating how easily and deeply they can reach into us. When it’s not about pure greed, it’s about making up for their own financial goofs, but either way, play your part and take what they give you. Because that’s all you’re gonna get.
Interestingly enough, Void Rays are most potent in this skirmish, for two reasons. One, most Protoss units are huge anyway, so the Void Ray does not waste much firepower. And secondly, Protoss do not have great anti-air defense with just early ground units. In fact, one cheesy but potentially deadly strategy is to rush a Void Ray at the enemy Nexus. If your opponent is caught off-guard, you win. Sure, a couple of Stalkers will easily overpower a Void Ray, but if the enemy is massing Zealots and/or Photon Cannons, then the Void Ray works. Photon Cannons will beat Void Rays, but a Void Ray can simply go around the Cannons or, if the enemy is not careful with Pylon placement, it can destroy the Pylon powering the Cannons.
So here I sit, in the passenger seat of a truck that’s hauling about 43, 000 pounds of peat moss, barrelling down Interstate 81 in Virginia at 100 km an hour . I have never seen truck traffic like this in all my life…keep in mind small town girl where a traffic jam is a tractor and 4 cars.

This might seem a little overdue, but I’ve been thinking lately that after Zaela turned out to be doing…sort of…an iffy job keeping the Dragonmaw on task out there in the Twilight Highlands, it might be a good idea for me to start paying a few inspection visits to some of our outposts out in the Eastern Kingdoms. Keep the field commanders on their toes, inspire the troops, all that good stuff.
Sentiment is Raindrop Echo w/Whimsy
The good news is that the religious fault-lines are pretty much the same kind of fault-lines as the political ones political activists are more used to. In religion as in politics, conservatives tend to be rather individualistic, as the ultimate goal is to win the reward of heaven for yourself. Conservatives tend to value tradition and traditional hierarchy above change and openness, believing that too much change is scary and that only traditional authority figures can protect us. Conservatives tend to believe that an excess of democracy and "rights,” whether in government or a church setting, is a bad thing. God's role for conservatives is to punish us if we stray from the one true path.

The pacing of BLACK SPOT seems designed for a classic Russell T Davies run and shout episode, but there’s no room for anyone to run anywhere – even the deck seems small and cramped. There’s a line where the Doctor is on the plank and he wonders aloud, “Where’s the rest of your crew?” but my immediate response was to ask back, “Where would you put them?” When Amy dons her pirate gear to save the Doctor and starts swinging around, it looks like she’s swinging just far enough to need to hold on to the ropes.

Moreover, he continued, decisions were made solely by the mayor and his surrogates. “The analyses of the benefits and costs remain obscure, partially because you guys have not produced the documents that would clarify them. The requests for additional bonding is similarly obscure,” he said. “The mayor’s and IDA’s failure to consider the issues raised by Mr. Kavanagh strikes me as a fundamental breakdown in the public policy analysis.”
Use the same rules of thumb that apply in all communication – be polite, listen, pay attention, don’t presume you know what they are saying, don’t finish their sentences, avoid going on the offensive, repeat back to clarify, stick to the topic, don’t change subjects, check and double check. Keep your communication pure and simple. Do not contaminate it with sarcasm, witticisms, or put downs. When you do that, people stop listening to what you say and get flooded with emotions and thoughts regarding how you are treating them.think about body language and facial expressions – these communicate more than words, as do tone and other non-verbal means of communication.

Now, for the sake of mind play, let’s say that I have been appointed the director of Health and Human Services. Congress has just given me a blank slate to decide how to best approach the health of the nation and whatever I say has the force of law. Also, realize that I have not been elected, so the decisions I make cannot be addressed by the population being effected by them. I cannot be voted out of office. Bras have a negative effect on the body and potential to cause cancer charging the system with costs for chemotherapy and surgery, therefore bra wearing needs to be discouraged. (hear certain male voices shout- hear, hear) As director with the force of law, I now declare that anyone wearing a bra must pay a health tax of 100% of purchase price, plus allow only mastectomy with 5FU chemotherapy – only – should a lump be found at any required annual physical. Any other health care must be paid cash – in Great Britain. The mobs will yell, but realize that without election, there can be no consequence for the giver of this edict. (side note – isn’t that why dictatorships change at the point of a gun?)

“Butch Cassidy never devoured the Sundance Kid,” she said, probably proud of her response. On a side note, having read numerous biographies over the years, many of which claimed Newman was secretly bisexual, there is the speculation that maybe Butch once did devour the Sundance Kid, so to speak.

Tuesday was back to business as usual, and business casual attire. You've heard the saying that people should eat three "square" meals per day? Well, I think of this as a "square" outfit. It's not particularly inventive or inspired, but it hits all the necessary points: work appropriate, polished, acceptable fit, and cheap. Hey, it's hip to be square, right?

In Florence we had a little dusting of snow, nothing compared with the sudden snowstorm of December 2010 that brought the city to its knees.

When my mother died, I suddenly felt cut-off from all contact with my home town and even Germany. Having been an ex-pat for many years, I had lost touch with all former acquaintances; I felt dreadfully homesick and full of fear that my past and all connection with it was disappearing. I felt as if the ground had been pulled from under my feet, that I was free-floating in no-man's-land. I did what I always do: I sent an SOS. Not in a bottle but in a letter to the Oberbürgermeister, the highest civic public dignitary of my home town. He read it and very kindly handed it to his secretary, who in turn handed it to the Press Office. I described who I am, what my situation was and that I hoped they'd find a way to publish my letter, which might, in turn, inspire someone to write to me. A kind of superior pen friend, who shared my cultural and leisure tastes. Naturally, I explained what kind of person would most suit my needs. It's always best to be as clear as possible, in order to weed out unnecessary complications. The Press Office put an article in the local paper, including my letter. They also started to send me regular bi-monthly collections of articles which they considered of interest to former inhabitants who now lived abroad. In those days of plenty, towns had a budget for such things; alas, times have changed. But there was one action which proved to be the most fortuitous for me: a bright spark handed my letter to the head of English at the local Volkshochschule - an academy for adult education -, namely, Gisela. She saw the letter, decided she wouldn't mind getting to know this crazy person who wrote unsolicited letters to the highest in the town and kept it for herself, rather than pass it on to her students. I met her a few weeks later and our friendship blossomed.
We decided to start getting back as the sun was starting to set, but first we had to deal with a huge people-jam. Whilst we were amongst it all, we thought we would never get out. I was very convinced it was a dead-end as there could be no other reason for all these people also struggling to move in the opposite direction to us. 15 minutes of my life wasted later and we were out. I felt successful. On the way back to the bikes I saw a scout stall selling t-shirts which I regret not buying. They said “I crown(in picture form) NL”. I don’t have a t-shirt to signify my stay in the Netherlands and this one seemed very nice in comparison to the ones we would see the next day in Amsterdam. I also want this one in town that says “I rain cloud (in picture form) NL”. However they only stock this in XL and man size. The burden of being a women.

She climbed over the railings and clambered carefully down the steep embankment. All she could see was grass. The banks of the stream were totally overgrown. How on earth were you supposed to find something in all the weeds? What should she be looking for anyway? She hoped she might find a bottle with a deposit on it because her mum and dad would give her the money for that. If she could save up enough money, she could afford to buy a Pocket Princess herself, and maybe that one would be the special edition of Ophelia… or an even prettier one.

Outside of the current presidential race, the Secret Service is responsible for guarding an array of politicians, even those from outside America. George W Bush is granted protection until ten years after his administration ended, or 2019, and every living president before him is eligible for life-time, federally funded coverage. Visiting heads of state are extended an offer too, and the events sanctioned as those of national significance — a decision that is left up to the US Department of Homeland Security — extends to more than the obvious. While presidential inaugurations and meeting of foreign dignitaries are awarded the title, nearly three dozen events in all have been considered a National Special Security Event (NSSE) since the term was created under President Clinton. Among past events on the DHS-sanctioned NSSE list are Super Bowl XXXVI, the funerals of Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford, most State of the Union addresses and the 2008 Democratic and Republican National Conventions.

Using a mortar & pestle grind the garlic with a little sea salt and then add chilli, sage leaves and thyme.

Then add the ricotta and about a tablespoon of olive oil and stir through. I like to add white pepper as well. Adjust seasoning to taste. And of course you can change any or ALL of these ingredients to whatever you like- no rules here!

“Polito on Thompson” features Robert Polito, author of Savage Art: A Biography of Jim Thompson, talking about the legendary writer’s relationship with Kubrick and the problems he encountered while working in Hollywood. Kubrick was a great admirer of Thompson’s books, especially his knack for writing dialogue, and wanted to utilize this strength in The Killing. Polito recounts how the two men met and their collaboration on this film.
bay west of the Twin Cities, and I have two Shetland Sheepdogs who go rowing and kayaking with me. I was a career teacher of the French language and culture at Chaska Senior High School. Since my retirement, I have been writing fiction and poetry full time. Music is equally important. I’ve played classical piano since I was a girl and have incorporated songs into this novel. My mother loved poetry and sang and hummed tunes as she went about her housework. My father was a terrific story-teller.
I can’t even describe how sneaky you are. I was taking my time. I was trying to take my own sweet time in choosing between you and other choices. I have this pros and cons list to compare. More importantly, I was looking into settling into a job first just to avoid any hassle. I want to stabilize myself before I get even a tiny hint of attachment to anyone. And now you have successfully placed this whole fence around me before I even realize it. Sneaky. Every single sweet gesture melts me. And you inspire me to study more, plan and plan some more.
To be specific, my wife believes our daughter has gotten injured way too frequently on my watch, and that I am somehow responsible. I, on the other hand, while conceding I would certainly like to see her get injured less often when I am watching her—or, ideally, not at
However (spoiler alert!), I can’t help but quibble with the ending – everything is wrapped up in such an oddly abrupt manner, with the hero and the villain essentially trading places in the blink of an eye. Belle’s reaction to the transformation is similarly odd, rendering her character shallow and calling into question her actions in the rest of the film. Of course, a fairy tale needs a magically happy ending, but this one is bewildering, almost as if Cocteau is sending up the genre itself.
One day the PM shouts to his UMNO members that they will guard Putrajaya even if it has to be over crushed bones and bloodied bodies. Then another day he says BN apologizes for its past mistakes. What kind of trade-off politicking is this?

Disc 1 - Letting Go
Frank confronts Cattano about his guaranteed piece of mind. Cattano tells him it could have been anyone, and ultimately it was his own success shooting at him. Frank sees reports about the evacuation of Viet Nam. He calls Nate, who tells him there's nothing he can do and "it's all over." Frank asks to get 2,000 keys in the air. When Nate won't entertain the idea, Frank tells him he's coming over there.

Let me get one thing straight before I start today’s rant: I don’t hate movies based on books. I really don’t…so long as it’s a good adaptation (read: caters to my nitpicky needs for everything to be exactly the same). But there’s something about putting a book written in first-person into film form that kind of bugs me- at least the idea of it.
Top 8 is back, and it's better then ever before, I have to say, because in this addition there's more romance, mysteries, heists, and extremely funny scenes that will have almost any reader laughing out loud!
I woke up after about a day of laying in a dead state in-dream. Disturbed, but relieved. And hoping that I never had another dream like it again.
Bomer was introduced as Cooper Anderson, Blaine’s semi-successful older brother who quickly has everyone under his spell. Rather than make Cooper’s smarmy, self-interested and attention-starved ego become irritating, Bomer managed to parlay it into comedic gold. I loved every second he was on my screen, and not just because he’s incredibly hot. Bomer’s guest spot, while coming at an incredibly inconvenient time due to the other storylines vying for space, managed to paper over the cracks. Like Rachel not reacting when Cooper proclaimed theater dead, or the fact that New Directions were eating up his incredibly bad acting advice as if it were ambrosia. But having Rachel play Agent Scuito during an NCIS side reading made up for it, as did his nonsensical advice about pointing to let people know you’re talking to them and being incredibly intense about it.

No, you do not need to get a fancy heart rate monitor; though it will certainly help improve your performance. Unless you’re confident in your cardio training (and if you’re not sure if you are, the answer is no) it’s very likely you’re not working hard enough at your cardio. There are lots of scales to choose from; a few examples are the talk test, karvonen ranges, or perceived rates of exertion. All are valid and helpful, just figure out which one works for you.
The next time a liberal calls you a homophobe or an Islamaphobe or any other “-phobe” for that matter, you should call them a conservaphobe –one who is plagued by an irrational fear of conservatives. Tell them that their own philosophical insecurity and lack of moral clarity causes them to subconsciously project their negative feelings toward conservatives. Tell them that they are simply jealous of your confidence and consistency. Tell them that they probably don’t know very many conservatives, which is why they are afraid of them. Then tell your liberal friend that American Leftists have a history in this country of hatred toward the Western culture, Judeo-Christian values, and individual liberty. Call them narrow-minded, intolerant, and intellectually inconsiderate. That should shut them up.

The blow from the steering wheel made me fade in and out of consciousness, so I had to fight to stay alert. “Reckon I never did any butcherin’ but there’s a first time for everything”, he mumbled as he ambled towards me.
“This is the most logical way to advance workplace protections, because discrimination is a phenomenon of human attitudes, and attitudes are changed through experience and personal growth, not through the imposition of federal law. Discrimination based on personal characteristics is an affront to human dignity, but creating federal penalties for discrimination will only spray perfume on one of the symptoms of discrimination without addressing the underlying cause.”

So I made a bet with my friend that I was on Google images so I seach it and I come up, there are about 10 or so pictures of me, but one is me booing Mao, I feel a lttle embarrassed. Then girls see me on the internet and then the tell other girls so what I’m blogging about gets around the whole year. The friend seaches on Google images “british school of beijing” and one of the first few pictures is me. I realized in some of my posts I had made fun of a few people. I had never realized it would come to this, that people would be reading it at my school.
It's been a great ride. I've enjoyed almost every minute of it. But the joy of discovering and sharing has, over the past few months, become the tedium of finding and posting. So it's time to stop.

There are a million reasons why she and I don’t look alike now, even if we did in college. We were both full-figured all through college and seemed like we always would be. Now, thanks to social networking, we keep in touch without staying close and I get to see all the reflection-in-the-mirror shots of how thin and smokin’ hot she looks now. And now I sound bitter. I am, of course, happy for her. And she really does look gorgeous and toned. But I want to lose that much weight too. And I don’t know what her diet or weight loss method has been. To be realistic though, whatever method she’s using may not work for me anyways. We all respond to different motivators and nutritional changes.

In response to these challenges, the Danish government adopted a policy of granting key concessions in what can only be considered an attempt at appeasement.

The most important of these were as follows:

I felt something but it was something new, a guilty version of angst: guilst, maybe. Why, with so many people having experienced loss, are there so few words that made sense of this? I felt bereft of language. Is there a word for that? I bet it’s not one of the forty-eight [emotions]. Speechless I suppose will have to suffice. I'm good with words most of the time but all of a sudden none of them seemed up to the task besides words-with-a-capital-w admit things and I wasn’t ready yet to let certain truths into my life.

Sometimes when a book is getting really close to releasing I’ll do this thing where I become a book stalker. I don’t do it intentionally really. It’s more of a random type of stalking, which I guess would shave a few years off my sentence (or a few yards off my restraining order) were we talking about humans and not books.
So – it’s useful to remember that what’s financially good for a business today is not necessarily what prepares it for a sustainable future and just as the pressure to outsource warehousing lead to – what is now - an unhelpful distancing between publisher and customer, in the same way the current rush to providing ebooks via reselling models that ape print book reselling models may not be the best long-term strategic solution.

Anyhow, now, just in time for Halloween, I propose to spend the next few posts hacking through the purple undergrowth of Marie Coolidge-Rask's prose (I do these things so you don't have to), distilling it into a chapter-by-chapter synopsis of her novelization. In this way I hope to get some sense of what audiences at Browning's vampire/murder mystery might have seen in 1927 -- sort of like Tod Browning, Polly Moran and Lon Chaney here pretending to commune with the spirit world for the MGM publicity department. This will be, so to speak, by the book, without reference to either Philip J. Riley's or TCM's reconstructions; if there are differences, maybe we can talk about those later.
I said I made a conscious decision to change, but I believe adolescence played a big part in it also. I had all of the hormonal changes going on, I was changing physically, my head was full of thoughts about my adoption, my adoptive parents were very strict and quite suffocating and I was becoming more outgoing and independent socially, meaning I craved more independence. I wanted some freedom, maybe to find myself and learn about life in my own way… as all teenagers do I guess. My adoptive parents and I clashed in a big way when I was a pre teen and then a teenager. Especially my Dad and I.

The traditional filling for this bread is an English walnut filling, but we were allowed to choose our own flavours. Keeping with the nutty theme I decided to use ground pecans and chestnut puree. As the swirls created inside the bread reminded me of cinnamon rolls, I also added raisins and cinnamon which together with the nuts gave it a wonderfully flavoursome and festive flavour.

Spending billions of tax payer money by government on failed endeavors is not the answer. The Private Sector has and will provide for the consumer what the consumer wants and needs. No one wants to pay a week’s salary for one tank of gas. When demand for a new product is high, which is now, free the Private Sector to do what it does best. Bring to market what works, at a reasonable price, for a profit. Yes, I said it, a PROFIT. This is what drives the economy, not government regulations and control.

My health declined rather quickly soon there after and I was in and out of doctors offices and hospitals. I began taking of a lot of my parents time and attention due to the muscle disorder and Leah needed more from them. She resented me for this. She knew it was nothing I was in control of but instead of being supportive and sympathetic she retaliated by telling me ” You’re faking” “You’re a liar” and “I hate you”. I now know that at that time Leah was dealing with he rown emotional pain and adolescent challenges. She was being bullied at school, feeling a lot of insecurities over her body, struggling to keep friends and loathing being poor. I became the target for her anger with life. Of course then I didn’t know what was taking place in her life and internalized all the mean things she would say and do. I was in physically pain, struggling with my own losses and fears and all I wanted was a loving sister. This continued into our teen years.
Unlike Neva, none of these symbols are tattooed anywhere on my body. I could never pick just one and to choose them all would make my body look like a children’s colouring book.

Jane Eyre
Relinquish shows a sheer delight in words and their possibilities in as many arrangements as you could possibly think of. Pugh really enjoys playing with sound as much as with form. Many of the poems are crying out to be heard aloud, such as this extract from "The Vault": "Vault: volver – volutum – to roll / A cavern. A chamber of interment. / A covered drain or sewer. The inside / of a steel furnace. But also: a gymnast’s leap, / to turn."

There are a few ways you can gauge your intensity when performing intervals. One of the best ways is to invest in a basic heart rate monitor that will show you how hard you’re working. Using the Karvonen method (try this calculator) to estimate your max heart rate (MHR), multiply MHR by .6 to get 60% of your max and aim to bring your heart rate down to this number during the recoveries. Once you hit 60% you can begin your next intense effort. If you don’t have a heart rate monitor the best thing to do is keep track of the time you’re resting for (suggestions above) and once you’ve caught your breath, start the next work period. For HIIT, you will try to work as hard as you can during the intense efforts until you’re breathing heavily and become winded. The efforts are really difficult but the nice thing is they’re very short. Those just starting out and using LIIT will not need to push this hard but can still work to an intensity that feels somewhat challenging.
How to do this? End all subsidies of all kinds for all energy sources now, and include in oil taxes the true full costs of defense and climate change, and in coal the true full costs of pollutants and climate change directly as taxes/fees on the users (mostly utilities) in proportion to emissions, all the costs of nuclear that haven't been included like disposal and health costs (one way to figure health costs for a reactor type is to use a global average of health costs per year to date for that reactor type), and even all the costs of solar panel production pollutants, and for wind energy the electrical transmission build out costs. Simply include the costs in the price to each source!
Premise #2: Zombies suffer from extreme behavioral modifications, primarily limited to the following: rabid aggression towards other humans, the complete destruction of human empathy or compassion, erasure or curtailment of the capacity for problem solving or creativity.

If you didn’t already realize, I’ll point out the obvious: Amstel beer is brewed here and named for the river next to which it has historically been brewed. Heineken (which also brews Amstel), Grolsch and Bavaria are also well-known Dutch beers. While in Amsterdam, visit the old Heineken brewery for the Heineken Experience, an interactive tour that shows you how the beer is brewed. Then taste some samples and create a personalized label for your own take-home bottle of Heineken.

I find that it becomes infinitely easier to look back on things and find the good in them after a few days. The same is true for looking back and seeing what truly was as bad or worse than you thought it was at the time and figuring out how and why it went so wrong. It's somewhat therapeutic, after an event such as this, to lounge and think about the whys and the hows and pick apart the stresses, fights and failures.

What a letdown. This complex flaunts terraces and an indoor swimming pool and a lobby fountain and a sauna. Very class. But here Vacuum Man’s pad sits practically empty. No digital TV or leather couches or wardrobe or anything. One mattress in the bedroom. A few putrefying plastic sacks in the fridge. Rows and rows of pills and stomach tabs in the bathroom. Probably Vacuum Man is too busy being a hog to think of home furnishings. Me and Jae watched him waddle to ATMs and conjure up wads from his fanny pack scarfing his way across town. A whole week we’ve been watching him.

His teammate Jenson Button, retired on lap 55, with a broken exhaust. Yet another blow to a team everyone predicted, to be the dominate force, starting the season. What’s most frustrating about McLaren’s scenario, is that their driver’s have played little part, in the team’s misfortunes. In the 3 weeks until Spain, McLaren need to seriously reassess their pitting strategy. They’re currently the only team on the grid, who don’t change tires with the nut pre-fastened to the wheel.

The Italian part of Switzerland is a city, Lugano shines under the sun. The people here at friendly and will welcome you as soon as you arrive. Walk through the Piazza Riforma while here, and make sure you have a taste or the most delicious cheeses and sausages that are sold in many shops around the city. The art and architecture of the city is also a part of the attraction of Lugano. Here, many art enthusiasts come and brew with artistic fringe. There are numerous museums around the city and exhibitions that will keep you busy the entire day. The climate here at Lugano is very dainty and comfortable. The best time to visit the city is during spring.
