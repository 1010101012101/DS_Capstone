And now Heckendorf is out to have his songs heard. His music is a kissing cousin to Ben Harper's swelling funk and Jack Johnson's easygoing sway. But while his flirty baritone has certain points of comparison, it is singular in its laid-back, on-the-beach tone. If given the right song, Heckendorf's pillowy vocals could very well make him a star.

His golden-skinned chicken ($50; serves two) is so plump and large, it looks like a miniature turkey. Tusk arranges a perfect chunk of white meat in the middle of the plate, with the prized oyster on top of bacon-scented greens on one side and pieces of crisp-skinned thigh meat on the other, all connected by a light, flavor-packed sauce.
The new guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration, which are voluntary, advise the agricultural industry to use antibiotics "judiciously" in treating and preventing sickness, and recommend that veterinarians oversee usage.

Why didn’t he talk about maintaining U.S. leadership in nuclear technology? Why didn’t he propose establishing a quasi-government bank to provide loan guarantees for construction of new nuclear plants and other energy facilities?

The film opened strongly with $19.7 million domestically from overnight shows starting after midnight. That's the seventh-best midnight total ever and puts the movie well on the way toward a blockbuster opening weekend.

1. Ohio State's Deshaun Thomas is a zone killer. He's a great fit at floating in the soft middle of a zone and hitting from anywhere within 15 feet. His quick-turnaround, one- handed half-hook is the kind of shot most zones aren't prepared to defend. And the ability Thomas has to catch and shoot without a second thought, which has driven people crazy at times during his career, is an asset against a zone because he gets the shot off before the defense swarms to him.
The search for Song was reactivated last spring after the Tribune contacted prosecutors and police about the dormant case.

All three of the favorites to contend for the division title this season have their No. 3 hitters signed to long-term deals worth more than $100 million each. They are the three crowd pleasers that Rolen mentioned: Votto in Cincinnati, Braun in Milwaukee and Holliday for the Cardinals. Combined, their teams have a potential $563 million invested in the three hitters over a total of 36 seasons. When it comes to the engine of their offense, clubs appear willing to bank on an individual's production but also the team success it can drive.
Love had a monster March, averaging better than 30 points and nearly 14 rebounds per game and becoming the first player in NBA history to lead the league in scoring, rebounding and 3-pointers for an entire month.

The move of McKernan's carnival act to KFNS has led to a year-to-year share increase for that program from 2.3 to 4.0. And the return of Slaten to KFNS (from which he was fired in 2008 by a previous regime after his controversial interview with Cardinals pitching coach Dave Duncan) has led to him more than tripling his piece of the market. He had a 0.7 share last year at 1380 but a 2.3 this winter with Feldman at 590.

Soon our plastic-lace tablecloth is piled with kebabs and a rainbow of subtly spiced vegetable preparations: luscious long-braised eggplant, whose caramelized sweetness is balanced with tart, creamy yogurt sauce; potatoes sauteed with loads of garlic, onion and cilantro; dol chalau, yellow lentils cooked down to a creamy puree and enlivened with garam masala-like spices; and sabzi chalau, a dish of long-simmered spinach and onions studded with beef chunks.

"This was before the media onslaught for Gardasil." When magazine and television ads for Gardasil started appearing, Stager said she saw a "huge jump" of understanding among the girls and their parents.
Food scares inevitably lead to calls for greater regulation, opening the door to influence by special interests with their own agendas. These could take the form of protectionist trade restrictions that raise prices for consumers. Other safety measures may be tailored in favor of the dominant agricultural system. In the meat industry, for example, the USDA's proposed National Animal Identification System would use expensive electronic monitoring equipment to track individual animals or, alternatively, entire lots of animals that move through the production chain as a group. The capital costs and lot option favor big players, and smaller farmers are rightly concerned that additional safety concerns will lead to the program's becoming mandatory. The high capital and compliance costs of these systems would harm the smaller, regional farmers you and I would like to see provide more of our food.

Baseball and biology came to this realization about the same time and, over the past 10 to 15 years, have taken a keen interest in analyzing old data for new insights. The old data are often sufficiently complete for us to discover new "laws" of baseball, invent new guidelines for recruiting and managing players, or, in science, to reveal new perspectives on how organisms live, grow and evolve. Yet in far too many cases, fresh scrutiny of old data reveals painful omissions that merely prove science has missed an opportunity.

The measure passed along mostly partisan lines, with the ruling Democrats putting it over the top.
This proposed budget marks the first time Carlson School of Management undergraduates will pay more than their classmates in other colleges. The regents paved the way for that tuition "surcharge" by changing a policy earlier this year. Under this budget, business undergrads will pay $500 on top of general increases next year. By 2015-16, those students will pay $2,000 more. The resulting revenue will add professors.

Karen B: Gail, I am a first time poster but long time reader (love this forum). Now, my question. I loved "The Glee Project" and looked forward to the winners (still mourn Hannah). One of the big points Ryan made was, "can I write for this character?". Well, he seems to have lost all mojo with Damian, it has been awful so far. In fact, I have about 20 ideas for story lines that are better than what has been on (really, a leprechaun, TWICE??) Do you think "Glee" has jumped the shark or is there still hope for a resurgence?
The novel's most appealing and artful achievement is the small circle of second-year students around Skippy. Perpetually quarreling, sardonic and mutually suspicious, and portrayed with a comically aching individuality, they are held together by a frail, us-against-the-world loyalty. It is a thing of time and circumstance; one of Murray's achievements is to evoke the mournfully short-lived nature of adolescent forevers.
For opponents, that was one of the main objections to the ICC. It does in fact cut through several parks and sensitive stream valleys, though the state has spent hundreds of millions on projects to mitigate the environmental damage.

Every neighborhood had a corner market selling stacks of the necessary herbs and raw vegetables: garlic chives, basil, mint, peppercress and tarragon, plus radishes and green onion.

Poursohi says this healthful dish is still part of his family table.

It's difficult to break the form-letter cycle. That's because customer service representatives typically receive so many complaints, they only have seconds to review your gripe and draw a response, which is normally a cut-and-paste reply. An appeal to a manager - either by phone or in writing - might have helped Hotwire see the error of its ways.
It isn’t clear when the Linnton Community Center Food Pantry might have to relocate, but Faccinatti is working on applying for grants and searching for a spot they can move it to. And he said they could always use an extra set of hands or food donations.

The Smarts are not just season ticket holders. They are among a growing population of sports fans across the country who buy "personal seat licenses," paying a onetime fee for the right to buy season tickets.

South Florida is known for many things: Alligators, orange groves and the writer who spins the area's most sensational attributes into even more sensational story lines, Carl Hiaasen. In his many bestsellers for adults and kids, Hiaasen has demonstrated a unique gift for wrapping real environmental issues into apocryphal, bust-a-gut books that parody pop culture — a talent he furthers in his most recent middle-school novel, "Chomp."

But in urban districts more heavily dependent on state aid, it was a proportionally smaller part of their budgets.
