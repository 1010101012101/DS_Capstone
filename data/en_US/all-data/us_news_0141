"It is wrong that our own federal government is suing the people of Arizona for helping to enforce federal immigration law. As a direct result of failed and inconsistent federal enforcement, Arizona is under attack from violent Mexican drug and immigrant smuggling cartels," Brewer said in a written statement.

Viso: Yeah. We have been rolling out a whole new way-finding system. More of it will be unveiled over the next months. Rather than do an architectural intervention, we're using color and signage. We're not physically changing the walls, but we're using movable screens and electronic technology to amplify and clarify that the Barnes Tower is really the museum tower and the Herzog tower is the theater tower.

DON’T BE SURPRISED IF
Steve Schoenfeld, ESPN.com: "I can imagine a secret society of Jack Quinn fans, holed up in an Elks Lodge somewhere ready to pop bottles of champagne with each Jamie Moyer loss or no-decision. You know, sort of like members of the 1972 Miami Dolphins when an undefeated NFL team finally loses late in the season. Quinn, of course, was the oldest pitcher to win a major league game, 49 years old and change when he pitched five scoreless innings of relief for the Brooklyn Dodgers on Sept. 13, 1932, to pick up the victory in a 6-5 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. Those imaginary bottles can be permanently put to rest now. Moyer pitched seven brilliant innings on Tuesday night at Coors Field -- well, as brilliant as a Moyer outing can be -- allowing only two unearned runs as the Colorado Rockies won 5-3. It was career win No. 268 for Moyer, tying him with Jim Palmer and more victories than Bob Feller or Carl Hubbell or Bob Gibson or Juan Marichal. And at 49 years and 150 days, he surpassed Quinn in the record books."

These memories were so unpleasant that I had erased them from my wine consciousness. Then a couple of years ago, I was with a foodie friend in New York City at a popular salumeria, and he ordered Lambrusco. The cold sweat, churning stomach and pounding headache returned for a moment, but when it cleared, my curiosity was piqued, and I mustered the courage to take a taste. This was nothing like the Lambrusco of my formative oenological years. The wine was richly colored, dry with no bubbles and had a light strawberry flavor with an earthy grip to the finish. Fascinating!

Up to a point, it can accommodate this through its own capital. It would at first reduce its annual distributions to member governments, and thereafter call on them to bolster its own capital. Who pays in the end? Taxpayers. If debt-strapped governments in weak countries can't afford it, taxpayers in stronger economies might have to take the greatest share. The battles over burden sharing so far suggest that a dysfunctional system of decision-making is increasing losses to all concerned. And whoever wins the battles, it's euro-zone taxpayers who will take most of the hits—led by German taxpayers, whether Chancellor Angela Merkel likes it or not.

Of those 71 walks, 21 of them are intentional. La Russa explained that by doubling up on leadoff hitters in addition to backing Pujols with Ryan Ludwick on Wednesday he was banking on keeping Pujols' bat in play by putting runners on. Hard to miss a .366 average against. But there are times -- like when he's leading off this inning here -- that the Pirates continue to pitch to him. Kudos for ... temerity. Pujols' average against the Pirates is his highest against any National League team, and his total bases against the Pirates are the most he has against any National League team.

This Toronto and Sundance favorite, written and directed by Lynn Shelton ("Humpday"), is the result of a 12-day shoot in which Emily Blunt, Mark Duplass and Rosemarie DeWitt worked from what the filmmaker calls a "scriptment." The premise: Blunt sends her best friend (Duplass), who is grieving the death of his brother, to her vacation cabin where her sister is in residence; when Blunt appears, three's a chaos. The premise of the film came from Duplass, who called Shelton and pitched the movie he wanted to star in, but not direct. "He said, 'The guy is in a bad place because he's lost his brother and his best girlfriend sends him away, and then he gets up there and there's this hot mother,'" Shelton remembers. "I said, 'Sounds great, but, um, can we make it an older sister?'" (June 15)

David Auburn has written a pretty good play about an immensely promising subject. It's the gap between expectation and result that makes "The Columnist" a disappointment, though there's nothing at all disappointing about the Manhattan Theatre Club's production, cleanly and clearly staged by Daniel Sullivan, or John Lithgow's elegantly flamboyant performance as Joseph Alsop, the once-celebrated newspaper columnist who coined the phrase "domino theory." A blue-blooded WASP who supported the Vietnam War long after most of his fellow journalists jumped ship, Alsop got into boiling-hot water when the KGB found out in 1957 that he was also a closeted homosexual and attempted to blackmail him. "The Columnist" revolves around these two facts, but Mr. Auburn devotes far more time and energy to the first one, and my guess is that by intermission you'll be thinking that he should have written his play the other way around.

The soul of the place is embodied in the Italian-influenced food prepared by chef-owner Ari Rosen, who cooked at Santi in Geyersville before he and wife Dawnelise Regnery Rosen opened Scopa in May 2008.

It has also struck a deal to collaborate with privately funded startup LightSquared on its LTE network. That network, however, is being held up by concerns that it will interfere with GPS navigation devices.
Taylor became one of KU’s most polarizing players perhaps in years. Fans didn’t know what to make of him. He was so talented. Such speed and talent. But his turnovers and off-court behavior were beginning to define him. Speed is nice, but the downside is an increased chance of losing control. What if he would just ease off the gas for a while? What would be possible then?

Auktyon began in the late 1970s in what was then called Leningrad in Brezhnev's Soviet Union; impassioned amateurs banging around on homemade instruments. Garkusha began as their sound engineer then became a band member as the band became part of an underground music scene that started when rock clubs began to open. With their theatrical stage show, they garnered a cult following in Europe as they stayed below the authoritarian radar at home with their oblique lyrics.

City Counselor Patti Hageman did not respond to a call seeking comment.
"It's strange because we practice great in practice," Ayodele said. "We don't hold or jump offsides or do all those dumb things in practice. We just have to focus better in the game and really try to correct that because it would help us out tremendously."
Favorite wildlife: Everglades. I've seen buffalo in Yellowstone and grizzlies in Kobuk Valley. But my most memorable meeting with nature was the half dozen alligators sunning themselves on a mud flat along the Anhinga Trail in the Everglades. A yawn from these snoozing, saw-toothed monsters will give you the chills, especially as they slip silently into the brown water, just their tiny eyes above the surface.
Those comments are in stark contrast to Blagojevich's public statements, in which he adamantly maintained his innocence through two trials since his arrest three years ago.

They will also help with instruction and perform in the district. This was made possible by a grant from the Highland Foundation.
Maybe Lamar's office was actually handed such a mess of a case that it had no choice. Maybe it was like a bad episode of Keystone Kops with Windermere police officers, Isleworth security guards, Orange County deputies and Florida Highway Patrol troopers all responding together to this single-car accident.
Thrasher also makes an off-the-menu special called "MacGriddle," which tastes like a McGriddle from McDonald's. This one mixes the bacon vodka with cream, maple syrup, a whole egg and confectioner's sugar. Smith warned us, "It coats your palate" and he was right: It's very sweet and good as a one-off dessert drink.

Lawrence's third marriage was to a woman with five kids. "The last were leaving home when I came along. Sexually, she outdid the last. I felt real appreciation from her. We lived together for a year, and she talked me into marrying her. Only after that did I find out that her father had physically abused her. Her mother had done nothing to stop it. She married her first husband to get away from home."

"We were trying to take aspects of Poe's life and aspects of his stories and meld them into one," McTeigue said in a telephone interview that took place, appropriately, on a rainy Friday the 13th.

Its not the boards intent to major in the minors, he said during a hearing where Foster had to weigh whether the commissioners, as argued by Hackel, overstepped their authority in a pair of contracting and purchasing measures they passed that authorizes them to review county contracts in excess of $35,000 or $100,000 for construction contracts. Foster suggested that the board could end up reviewing 20,000 contracts, a number he said would approach the ridiculous, although Commissioners Chair Kathy Vosburg said the $35,000 threshold for commissioner approval would put the number at fewer than 50 contracts per year that theyd likely review.

Five militiamen were killed and eight wounded in the suicide attack, according to local police and health officials. Violence in Samarra, a mostly Sunni city 60 miles north of Baghdad, is particularly perilous because it is the site of a Shiite shrine that was bombed in 2006 in an attack that touched off a wave of sectarian clashes around Iraq, claiming thousands of lives and raising worries that Iraq was heading for civil war.

A successor to Steven Libman, who resigned last summer, is expected to be announced this year; Frank Basile is serving as interim CEO.
Down in Washington D.C., Andy Pettitte continued to testify in the government's perjury case against Roger Clemens. On the face of it, this was a stunning drama: a beloved Yankee testifying for the prosecution in a case against his idol and friend, one of the game's all-time greatest, a former Yankee himself. But the public is exhausted by stories like this, worn down by baseball's lost PED era, comical obfuscations and investigations that fail to offer resolution.
If the cake is made correctly, the answer is yes to all of the above. I'm quite fond of it. I don't know of another food that simultaneously resists and surrenders, and sticks and unsticks the way nian gao does. Like bubble gum, it satisfies every child-like drive for oral exploration, and unlike bubble gum, in case it needs to be pointed out, nian go is healthful. It's basic starch cooked with meat and vegetables in a balanced dish.
"He's got a tremendous first step out of the gate and he's got speed after that if you want," the trainer said. "He can be right up on the pace. If it's a hot and heavy pace he can be laying off it like he was in the Kentucky Derby.

Hey, Norman: I don't believe James' behavior as a Cav was ever "loathsome." Something that was an issue with the Olympic team was his reluctance to accept the sort of leadership role the coaches expected of him. This was covered in regular reporting and then in great detail in the book I authored with Terry Pluto on James' development into an MVP that was co-published by The Plain Dealer. The coverage of James over the last seven years, in Cleveland and from the outside, has been as comprehensive as any athlete in pro sports. As I've written before and will continue to: whatever issues there were with James, the Cavs were more than ready to re-sign him for six more years. Whether or not he's can be a champion is yet to be seen. But what he brings massively outweighs any downsides.

Christie acknowledged the legal exercise delayed the program’s start and said he would be disappointed if dispensaries did not begin operating by the end of the year. He also thanked two of the law’s Democratic sponsors, Assemblyman Reed Gusciora (D-Mercer) and Sen.

With its Johann Strauss II music and ballroom divertissements for a group of sweet girls and the shy cadets who come to dance with them, "Graduation Ball" runs the risk of cloying cuteness. While those pitfalls weren't entirely avoided, this opulently designed bauble (sets and costumes by David Guthrie) brought things to a winning close. Bumbling into each other's arms, the gawky young dancers promptly became a river of gliding waltzes. Karen Gabay, in springy pigtails, had a perky solo turn. Briones and Jing got into an "American Idol"-style spin-off of fouettes. Rodriguez, who staged the piece, did double duty with an inspired comic turn as a bandy-legged general in a bumper-car pas de deux with the adroitly lumbering Maximo Califano in a travesty role.
The effects of his illness were most apparent between songs. Some of his banter felt hurried or disassociated with his surroundings. Some of it was humorous, too, like his recollection of meeting John Wayne. Ashley Campbell, 25, kept things on track, with much sport and grace. As her father left the stage for a break, she said something to him, as if to remind him not to go too far, that he'd be coming back on stage soon. It's a phase most of us go through: becoming our parents' custodians. To see it carried out in public with so much love and aplomb was moving.
Henson said Glen Carbon follows similar protocol, removing snow from arterial roads first, subdivisions, then alleys and cul-de-sacs. Snow removal on Illinois Routes 157, 159 and 162 is managed by the Illinois Department of Transportation.

The bill's sponsor, Rep. Bob Mecklenborg, a Cincinnati Republican who chairs the State Government and Elections Committee, said in a statement that the bill is intended to "safeguard the integrity of the elections process" and "take steps to prevent voter fraud."

In 1959, a Chronicle story on the "enigma" of bridge suicides quoted East Bay psychiatrist Malcolm A. Sowers: "When someone jumps from that bridge, he is, in a way, joining all those who went before.

Panel: This is about the commerce clause and severability, really, and, as you could see from Chief Justice John Roberts' questioning, he's got serious doubts. And Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. had a very bad day because he couldn't answer Justice Antonin Scalia's question about broccoli.
As the millionaires tax debate simmered, Democrats held hearings to highlight the impact of Christie’s far-reaching cuts to education, social programs, even services for the blind. But attention fixated on a different spectacle: the governor’s nasty and colorful fight with the New Jersey Education Association, the powerful teachers union that became Christie’s favorite target.
But bigger picture? The White Sox are still struggling to get runs on the board, which was the same problem last season. The players, however, seemed to spend most of spring training insisting that the new change in manger, as well as Jeff Manto taking over the hitting duties, also meant fewer distractions and a better chance to succeed.
Six games. Six wins. 18 points. This actually needs more numbers to make it a completely mind-altering sentence: Sporting KC have trailed for a grand total of 24 minutes, just finished a streak of not allowing a shot on goal in 335 minutes and, oh yeah, have only ceded one solitary goal.

So far, Cano isn't striking out at abnormal levels. But there are a few factors that might explain his slow start. In some cases, those numbers show why Cano should round into form eventually. His 21.8 percent line drive-rate is down, but not by much after he finished with a 22.3 percent line-drive rate last season. Also, Cano can's batting average on balls in play has historically been above .300. This year, it's just .279. Cano's ground-ball rate seems to be the most obvious abnormality, though even those rates are a good bet to stabilize.

For at least one player, Daniel Bejarano, it was a chance to meet a man he'd never even heard of growing up as a rising basketball star in Phoenix, and at the same time, reaffirm his commitment to Colorado State.

"The line is silk and cotton so in some states people can wear it all year long and in others they can't in winter," she explained. "So I went after the Australian market because their seasons are on a flip cycle from the United States.

-- Chris Stewart is in the lineup as the catcher with Russell Martin as the DH because Girardi wanted load up on right-handers. He cited the splits of Orioles lefty Brian Matusz, who has left lefties to a .154/.214/.154 slash line. Against righties? .333/.424./.514.

And she grew to love them. The plains gave her one of the more remarkable stories this museum will tell, that of the northeastern town of Keota. It was founded by immigrants and East Coast residents drawn by the railroad and the chance to homestead. It was an agricultural community, riding the boom-and-bust cycle until the hard times became so hard there was no coming back.
Outlook: After two decades of doldrums, Washington envisions Griffin as type of player who can transform franchise, his personality and talent steadying a team that has used 21 starting quarterbacks over 19 seasons. Much will hinge on Griffin's ability to mesh with Shanahan father-son tandem: coach Mike and offensive coordinator Kyle. If Mike Shanahan thought his reputation was on line last year, it truly is now. His two Super Bowl titles with John Elway came in last millennium, and he's only active NFL coach who hasn't reached playoffs in last five full seasons in charge.

"On Saturday, Aug. 13, I had the pleasure of enjoying the Doo Wops concert at Cain Park. However, it was marred by three men (definitely not gentlemen, by my standards) who sat in front of me and my friends.

The gas-sipping Volt is part of Voss' case for why Missouri needs to change the way it regulates utilities.

In the coming weeks and months, there will be a blizzard of facts and figures provided regarding the "impact" to the surrounding area from the inaugural Baltimore Grand Prix. Economic impact studies, attendance and spending estimates, you name it; we are bound to hear about it. Someone may proclaim the impact is $50 million. Another will say, "No, it's $65 million." I can see the stand-off now, when those on each side of the issue present their respective studies. We might even be treated to dueling studies — something like "white papers at 20 paces."

"I don't think we played well at all today," the coach added. "The field was very poor. I thought it matched our performance. Maybe we came into the game a little bit better in the second half, but I think the penalty call obviously goes their way; they score a goal and the game changes."

The authors were particularly pumped about improvements in childrens' aerobic capacity, which they said strongly suggests that kids stepped up their levels of physical activity in the six-year period. That may be the result of burgeoning public health campaigns encouraging kids to exercise (including First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move campaign). But some credit, no doubt, is due to the state's requirements, starting in 2006, that all public schools provide, over each 10-day period, 200 minutes of physical education to all kids in grades K-to-five and 400 minutes to all kids in grades six-to-12.
