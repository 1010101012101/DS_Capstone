Over on Saints and Spinners, a fellow blogger is discussing the question of telling stories (see her post on July 29th.) Stories, that is, from another cultural group. That blogger is a storyteller, and she's left Native stories alone, because she's not sure if it's appropriate, what permissions are involved, etc.
However, Resident Evil‘s games have remarkably little in common with the film series that shares their names. There’s references and plot elements stitched together to create a Frankenstein of a movie, but it’s diluted with human elements which sit at odds with the generally action-oriented style of the game – and action which is just too eccentric to sit well with that style. The films are created by an entirely Western crew and were heavily panned – and the games have been almost universally critically acclaimed having been produced by a Japanese game development squad. Y’see?

People who feel out of control tend to become controllers. Deep down, they’re afraid of falling apart, so they micromanage to bind anxiety. They might have had chaotic childhoods, alcoholic parents, or experienced early abandonment, making it hard to trust or relinquish control to others, or to a higher power. Some controllers have a machismo drive to be top dog in both business and personal matters–a mask for their feelings of inadequacy and lack of inner power. To assert territorial prowess, they may get right up in your face when they talk. Even if you take a few steps away, they’ll inch forward again into your space.
I can't sleep. Well that's not true, I'm simply unable to fall asleep. So I decided to read some forum entries on Dunkelsüß. One discussion was especially interesting to me: "Animal ears with Lolita?".
I don't even try to pretend that my family is warm and fuzzy. My parents have always been cold, especially to me. I have accepted that. I mean really....my dad has actually told me I am a terrible parent and should have had Andrew taken away from me. At the age of 22 I was told I would never be welcomed into their house ever again and to never come to their house ever again. No Christmas or birthday presents for years. My mom has been trying in her own way to make amends but it really is worthless at this point. Words and actions are two different things. Over the past few years I have had two people tell me how sorry they felt for me when i was young and they didn't know how I could have overcome some things. This has piqued a curiosity in me because I don't have any childhood memories. Some are fuzzy and when I ask mom about what I do remember she will just make stuff up that is rosy or say she doesn't know what I am talking about or that I am confused. I know I am not confused because of some of the details....they have been validated.
Fred Eberhart has a daughter, Ariel, who works at a club as a fire-dancer. Nick goes to question her, solo – because that’s how bad partnerships work. At the club, Nick encounters Wesen up the wazoo including my favorite Blutbad, Monroe. He’s there to gawk at Ariel.
I hadn’t had much to drink, Peter had had none, the others had had too much lol! It basically turned into a personal psychology session for all of them and I sat at the head of the table thinking what a ludicrous evening this was turning out to be and felt bad for Peter. The evening came to a close thankfully. I think my sis-in-law left first as she had an hours drive ahead of her, then the others left as well as Peter. They all thanked me, they all seemed to quite like Peter and I was thankful they were all gone!

I decided to join SCBWI when I became serious about getting published. I was attending a lot of talks and I thought all that good information was going to waste so I started blogging. I was deep in nappies at the time and I enjoyed blogging because it had the edginess of journalism a deadline which I missed.

It’s both a help and a hindrance. I was an editorial director for many years, so worked with numerous writers on their novels, which has taught me that there’s no right and wrong way of doing things, and of course a great deal about plotting and character - although putting what one’s learned into practice is never as easy as you hope it will be. On the other hand, the market has changed dramatically since I was a publisher, so my knowledge of sales and marketing is out of date, and I have to keep reminding myself of that.

But, alas, the black back-up singer has come back in the body of a young English girl as a lead singer who owns the world. Did she really record "21" when she was 21 years old? She's truly an old soul. Adele has touched so many people because of the emotion and pain she emotes in her songs. The melodies harken the soulful sounds of 60's and 70's and amplifies them with the rules of this decade.

At 11 o’clock, go for a walk around the village to visit, to the wooden house to see how the villagers lived long ago, make a stop, breathe fresh air, and after I finished the UNESCO world heritage site visited the old church, a church painting impressive and unique in the world. On one wall of the church are painted devils, as people who scoff at sin, and many other unique elements of the church. Hebrew cemetery visit, the source of mineral water and walk through the village to observe the habits of the villagers.
When you are writing a journal it is important to be honest. You do not want to write anything that is not true. After all this is something that you are using to let your true feelings come out. This is a way for you to express who you are and what your intentions are. You want to make sure that you are keeping this journal in a safe place so that no one else will be able to get your private thoughts. You do not want others to know how your personal feelings are affecting you in some circumstances.
My dad has been dead 10 years and I often wonder what he would think about me connecting with all of these cousins. He would probably think it was neat! He would be giving me names of others to search for. It is a wonderful time to be doing family research.

More driving till the Grayling lake. This is the spot where we were going to be picked up and flown to Bettles. It turns out that Alaska has, at least, two Grayling lakes – one is in Yukon Flats area, another is where we were going next to the Dalton highway. A search in Google maps points you to the lake in Yukon Flats. On the way to our lake we stopped at the very important point – the Arctic Circle sign. How can we miss that obvious touristy spot. Well, our group wasn’t the only one there taking stupid photos. After that in a couple of hours we reached the starting lake.

After a short-lived partnership with Danone, Cacolac was recently taken over by the industrial holding Trixaim. The majority shareholders Didier Giroux and Dominique Rault are now looking to take the company to new levels as they believe it is currently delivering at just 40% of its full potential. By 2015 they are aiming for a two-fold increase in revenues (7 million euros in 2010) through plans including extended distribution drives, increased sub-contractor production for other companies, the launch of new goat’s milk and bio dairy products, and an increased focus on Vanilac, a vanilla-flavoured milk beverage.

As we prepared to head back to the states and home I reflected on the trip. We saw a lot, we did a lot and we ate an awful lot. Everyone thanked me for the trip but I was thankful for the fact that for 2 weeks, all 6 of us were a family. I was thankful that I was able to share a bit of family history and Irish heritage with my daughters. I hope now they appreciate what I mean when I call the British, no good so-and-so’s.

“When you hear councillors say they don’t want people from Ancaster who come down to get a suntan to get a parking ticket, the real issue is does the city really intend to ensure the traffic calming work in the North End and will it be safe for kids to cross the street or not,” Turkstra said.

I see lots of lovely Distress colors here. Am I the only person in the stamping world who did not buy the limited edition fall colors of distress inks (I am adamantly opposed to buying ink pads without a reinker!)? I love the purple and gold mix and the diffused look of the images. The little punched corner detail also adds to the vintage charm and ties the three designs together.
Russian homo-erotic macho icon Putin had good reason to say such a thing: he knew only too well that Dominic Strauss-Kahn’s removal from his IMF job would pave the way for a greater US control of matters in the IMF. Rasputin never says anything without an agenda in mind; and although it could be argued that he shouldn’t give a toss either way about who runs the International Monetary Fund, the truth is that Vlad the Impaler would have preferred dealing with a megalomaniac like DSK – rather than a blue-stocking Amerophile like Christine Lagarde.

Brazil produces at about the 65% of the stones sold in the world. This commercial event is due to the convenient prices and the complete variety of stones coming from the Brazilian mining, there also are beautiful silver objects as jewels ingrained with the religious traditions of the country. It is better to acquire these stones in reliable jeweler’s that give you receipts of guarantee and authenticity.The acquisition of these stones can be related to visits to carving laboratories, which offer them gratuitously by menas of the great international house as that one of Stern.

Cleopatra Hill sits at about 5,000 feet above sea level in north-central Arizona. It was here that in 1883 a New York investor, Eugene Murray Jerome, purchased mineral rights from a small group of prospectors and began to finance a mining operation. A short time later, in early 1889, the town of Jerome, encompassing less than one square mile on the side of the steep hill and with a population of eight, was incorporated. The town’s namesake, Mr. Jerome, would never set foot in it.

What allowed me to bring those flowers in here to start with was dunking them - flower end down, into cold water, to the full depth of the stem. Keeping them there for at least a minute. Shaking them, giving them a bit of a swirly, then giving them a once over to see if there was anything still on them.

If at the end of all this, you are still left wondering, “Why should I care?” then let me make something abundantly clear: Caring about the impact your actions have on others is not social justice activist field training. It’s a basic skill that you need to coexist with other people. If there is any circumstance in which you would respond to a friend who is sitting you down because you’ve hurt their feelings with grace and politeness, then this is a skill you already have. If there is no circumstance in which you would respond with an honest appraisal of your own actions and a willingness to change how you behaved so that you aren’t a cause of pain to someone close to you, then your problem is way bigger than how you deal with accusations of bigotry. You’re just a jerk in general.
In case you haven't heard of it, I stumbled upon a website called My Fitness Pal. This site is free and it helps you count your calories (super incredible easy peasy) and keep track of your exercising. It's uber cool. I recommend it because 1) it's free and 2) it is a fantastic tool. Also, I am in a wedding party this summer and could stand to shed a few pounds.
It may surprise you to know that of the frequently going 12-39 age group (45% of the movie-going population), women outnumber men (though slightly). But while the overall numbers of moviegoers are slightly female heavy, the ticket sales are exactly even. Consider this in light of the fact that 2010 saw a net swing of .9 tickets/year in favor of men from 2009.
Nothing too exciting there. We didn't get to choose the paint colours, other wise those vanities would have been white and the walls would have been grey.

The best way to do this is to keep track of how much you spend for one month. The worksheet below divides spending into fixed and flexible expenses. Fixed expenses are those that generally do not change from month to month, such as rent and insurance payments. Flexible expenses are those that do change from month to month, such as food or entertainment. If some of your expenses for one or more categories change significantly each month, take a three-month average for your total.

I have been feeling a little lost lately. I have no motivation, low self esteem and very little patience. I am not sure where that is coming from.

Now games have a very clear narrative structure to them. Characters, story, and aspects similar to those of a movie, novel, or TV show. However, there is a totally different aspect to games than there is to any of these. The aspect of play and interactivity that isn’t present in these other items.
I suppose if money-making is your indicator of success, then so be it. In your world, there would be no music, no theater, no dance, no short stories and novels, no ballet. Everyone would be making big money and will have lost their soul and their vehicle for carrying history and culture to the subsequent generations. I would challenge anyone who calls my DMA in music pedagogy “useless” – I spend my days making music with children.

Happy mother’s day! I started thinking that although my dad makes an appearance on the blog every now and then, you’ve seen very little of my mother. That’s because when my dad and I are working on house projects, she’s doing the really hard, behind-the-scenes work—watching my kids!
That said...I absolutely do not want to be left alone on Mother's Day. I want to spend every second I can with my 2 sweet babies. I waited for so many years to get to celebrate this special day as a mom. I dreamed of the things I could do, and those always included little smiling faces. I imagined what it would be like to face that day with a full heart. Last year, my first Mother's Day as a mom, I did sleep in. And then I spent the whole day with my family, just relishing the feeling of being a mom.
But the two strangers were right behind her. Then the larger of the two men came around in front of her mother, bent down, picked up the dog and told her that the dog’s nails had not been clipped correctly. Her mother looked up to where the voice came from.
There are a great many people in our kitchen by five o’clock and the noise level is tremendous. As usual, no one is taking advantage of the acres of floor space we’ve created by moving the table to the side. Instead, there is a huge crowd congregating around the oven and the vat of Mr Young’s famous mulled wine.
Alone among the Republican field, Mr. Paul, a Texas congressman, has a built-in network from 2008 that gives him a decisive organizational edge. Iowa Republicans say that advantage is an important reason some polls show him within striking distance of a victory in the Jan. 3 caucuses, with a battle-tested ground game poised to take advantage of a lack of passion for the rest of the candidates, a stark contrast to 2008, when evangelicals rallied around Mike Huckabee.

For some odd reason, throughout college, I had a penchant for somehow being involved in several LDR’s (if you can call them that), and for me, it’s no big deal if I don’t see my significant other more than twice a month. As long as I know that he’s thinking of me and how I’m the coolest, hottest piece of ass walking this planet, that’s fine with me. Plus it takes the routine out of seeing each other, and makes each reunion that much more exciting.
Perhaps I have missed it but I have not seen any comparisons between GWB and Winston Churchill. Yet their policies and views are strikingly similar.

You can easily find a list of McDonalds restaurants with playplaces by entering your zipcode into the McDonalds Locator.
The two Spaniards, Isabella Sanchez and Inez De Rojo, never arrived at their hotel, and never left on any of the ferries.

In my opinion, the most attractive of the species concepts is the ecological species concept, whereby species are defined as groups of organisms with distinct ecological roles, or niches. But this one is riddled with troubles too…in order to define species in this way, we would need to know how they behave in nature. We would have to observe them in every phase of their lives. And how would we account for species that have drastically different ecological roles in their juvenile and adult stages? The caddisfly, for example, is entirely aquatic and can be carnivorous when juvenile, and winged and nectarivorous when adult.

Exhibit B: THE DRONES (Centre Stage). I first came across the Australians when invited to review their third album proper for the final issue of the Vanity Project fanzine - and what a serendipitous encounter that turned out to be. Gala Mill revealed itself to be stuffed with extraordinary bruised and nauseous blues - sometimes scorching and violent, sometimes slow and skulking along in the dust, latent with menace like an alternative to Nick Cave and Warren Ellis's soundtrack for The Proposition. Follow-up Havilah hasn't impressed to date, but theirs has still been one of my most eagerly anticipated sets of the weekend. Opener 'Jezebel' sets the tone perfectly for an hour during which the sombre, country-tinged side of their nature is suppressed in favour of the more aggressive and fiery. Gareth Liddiard's heavily accented vocals may be offputting to some, but there's no denying his capabilities as a guitarist. The only regret is that we aren't treated to 'Sixteen Straws', Liddiard bemused why we'd want to hear a nine-minute-long narrative about murderous pacts among convicts. That would be Gala Mill's predecessor Wait Long By The River And The Bodies Of Your Enemies Will Float By added to the lengthening post-festival shopping list, then.

Definitely far from a barnburner, the affair was still a credible showing given the assumed wrestling acumen of both Divas.

I just got off the phone with the wife about Oktoberfest, and it turns I actually drank the last of the Eliot Ness. She hadn't tried it yet so I kind of screwed up there. As such I'm slugging down a can of Fat Tire right out of the can along with my Enchiladas from Sylvia's. I'm telling, I go into WITHDRAWAL if I do not have some good Mexican or Tex-Mex at least once a week. If your town doesn't have at least 10% illegal immigrants, your Mexican/Tex-Mex food is probably not up to snuff. I'm doing a full 5 gallon boil on the stovetop, so it is taking FOREVER for this thing to reach a boil. And it will take forever again after I add the extract. So I'm sitting here listening to 2 Live Stews podcasts and watching UFC Wired.

P.S. Bill Nemir subsequently told me that the party occurred at his house, that it was Christmas and not Halloween, that Anna called him the next day asking for John's number, and that he refused to give it to her because he didn't fancy playing the go-between role. But when John called to ask for Anna's number, Bill felt he had no choice but to give them what they both wanted, and then to get out of their way. And so he did and all was well.

I'm afraid I have to conclude that I'm depressed. It doesn't actually surprise me all that much after all that rapid cycling I have done lately. I've gone up and down too much for it to have left me unaffected. Now I'm caught on the way down and I'm not done going down even more. It's a miserable situation.
But this is part of the purpose of a shaman – to walk with one foot in this world and the other elsewhere. To act as a spiritual diplomat, and move between many different environments. To redress the imbalances.

Nice, huh? The stupid boxwoods were so close to the chain link fence that their roots were way under the concrete foundation, and the "trunks" of the bushes would not allow the chain to get a good grip on the plant to pull them out with the tractor, so they had to be dug out by hand.

I said yesterday that Jack Black is often better as a supporting character than the main. That is not meant to be a sweeping generalization. He is up and down as the lead character, but when he is up, he flies high. Case in point is Shallow Hal, a film with some big laughs, a few awkward ones, and a strange poignancy at times.

And so much for not blogging for a day or two.
After that season (in which Elon was 2-10) Seagraves was replaced by Paul Hamilton, who would coach the Phoenix for two years. After consecutive 3-8 seasons, Hamilton would be succeeded by current Elon coach Pete Lembo, who is now in his fourth year at the school.
Produced in a continuous still instead of the traditional copper pot still, the Greenore 8yr is lighter in taste but rougher on the back of the throat. So with this in mind, the nose gave off some delicate citrus notes with a slight mix of corn. As it hits your tongue, it gives you a short, sharp hit but mellows quickly into a more distinctive citrus taste with a hint of barley coming through as it gives you a subtle burn (not as harsh as you would expect a grain whiskey to be).
Lastly, trim off any extra fabric along the edge and corners (but outside of the ¼” seam allowance) to prevent unnecessary bulges. Trim off the extra zipper as well.

First the report on Labour backbencher Keith Davies uncovering some pretty ugly behaviour more associated with drunken yobs on a Friday night than that of an elected representative, making the slap on the wrist given out as punishment by the Assembly Committee even more farcical, it’s now left to the Labour Group to hand out any meaningful punishment, but i wouldn’t hold your breath. If Keith Davies had any decency he would stand down, in no other job would behaviour like that be acceptable.

During the select committee session in question, Brooks was flanked by her amnesiac minder Andy Coulson. The second she uttered the above words, Coulson chipped in helpfully with “But of course, always legally”. Mr Vaz’s letter is understood to be asking Ms Brooks how it is possible to pay police officers for information and remain on the right side of the law. This may explain why Rebekah needs more thinking time…especially as she no longer has Handy Andy to help her on the creative side of things.

Like most prisons and institution, everything was run on a schedule. Fear was the chosen motivator used by the adults to get the children to behave. Orphanage workers make an average of $130 per month so it is very common for them to steal from the children in the orphanage to have food and gifts for their own children at home. They steal the belongings and literally take the food from the orphans mouths, though honestly the food provided is very limited and low quality. This contributes to the malnourishment and small size of the children; contributed to the many stomach illnesses that plague Vika.

I have to stack things in a certain order in my grocery trolley. When I get to the checkout I have to load them on the belt in a certain order. Not necessarily the same order every time but with things correctly grouped. I am sure this helps the check out person. I see people flinging their milk with the tins and fruit with the washing powder and it causes me some stress!!!!! Maybe, if I tried a little harder I could be OCD. Nah...........

It is only after this homoerotic experience that Miss Lonelyhearts is prepared to give in to the easy "normality" that stands as a false image of true love. He agrees to marry Betty, attended with all the legalistic decision-making of any new partnership: she agrees to have a child, he agrees to see a friend about a job. "...They decided to have three beds in their bedroom. Twin beds for sleep, very prim and puritanical, and between them a love bed, an ornate double bed with cupids, nymphs and Pans." It is clear that love will be more a symbol in that household than an everyday reality.

Our theme this week was "March Madness", but since I don't actually watch basketball, or any sport really, I just went with a favorite color combo. The madness in this look is mostly because I'm posting a sleeveless dress and sandals in March, and it something I could actually be wearing right now. In fact, I am wearing a sleeveless dress at the moment and I'm not even the slightest bit chilly!
If we did shoot it down what would China do? Nothing. It would issue a statement denouncing the action and then it would be back to business as usual. It would, however, send a message to them and the North Koreans that the U.S. is not a paper tiger.

It was ten days before he died, so I got to see him before he really curled his toes over the edge, thank God. We'd spent 3 weeks together in November - just father, mother and daughter - and it was such a gift, I think it's helped me get through all the other shit over the past 8 months.
Anyway. After that there was an incident last summer where Owen came in crying and all upset. Him and Nora had been in the back yard playing in the little kiddie pool. I guess they got into a fight and he hit her. The lady saw and yelled at Owen, called him a horrible brat or something, told him he was a bad kid. WTF!

a. Jesus was transformed at the resurrection through being exalted as man to the throne of God. Not only was he transformed positionally but Jesus also received a glorified body. His resurrection was physical not spiritual. This body not only is capable of going through walls and appearing (teleporting) if you will to wherever he wants to be, this body is capable of enduring the presence of God, where Jesus Himself is at this moment.

When you have a child screaming and thrashing about, people tend to stare and, on occasion, say something rude. As I am sure you can imagine, this does not help. As a therapist, not a parent, it was easier for me to ignore rude people, but all I could think during these situations was how hard it must be for the parents when the looks and murmurs are directed at them and their child. Those people passing judgement don’t know or understand the truth of the situation. To them, you are a bad parent and your kid is a brat. That is a hard pill to swallow, especially when you know that nothing could be further from the truth.

She freely admits that she is constantly in a depressed conditon. She freely admits that she has been in therapy for 30 years. She freely admits that she has a host of medical problems – she was freely talking about her Irritable bowels on the airplane ride to Phoenix Arizona for our brother’s funeral in 2003 – and she was talking about the symptoms – with a stranger – about diarrhea! lol.
GLENN CLOSE / Patty Hewes – “DAMAGES” (DirecTV)
The answer lies in our own desires. Our own lustful and coveting flesh. We must put to death the desires of the flesh. We must humble ourselves before God through prayer and fasting. We must take the world out of our lives, our homes, and yes, even our churches. We must discipline ourselves to seek the filling of the Holy Spirit and to ask Him to fill us and empower us to walk the narrow path Jesus speaks of and to be guided by Him away from the wide road to destruction.
In a sense, Protestants are correct when they say we worship the mother of Christ. In a sense. I’m not sure if you’re aware of this, but in older times than ours, the term “worship” had a much broader meaning than what is thought of today. When someone says “worship” now, you undoubtedly think of that supreme honor given to God. But did you know, my dear readers, that worship can be defined more broadly as well?

She did this for two days, until we mostly parted ways with that squall. If you’ve never been in circumstances like that, I can only tell you that she is not just mentally, physically, and emotionally tough, she is double tough. Beyond tough. Even though the squall was gone, we still faced three more days of sailing before reaching Naples. She, of course, continued to do her part and more. I wish you could have seen her as she piloted the Zombie Princess into the gas dock at the Naples Marina pretty as you please. An elemental power. A goddess.

I actually feel sorry for the teachers she worked with, I still believe that they utterly failed to do their duty and that should be addressed, but I think it is entirely plausible that they were terrified of the bidella and well aware that the judicial system, in tandem with their own management, would not offer them any protection from the worst she could do to them or their families if they crossed her. They were placed in an unimaginable difficult position. Their priority should have been the children in their care, but in the circumstances there may well be room to believe that they were traumatized. Rather than an innate inability to understand their obligations and perform their role, the cause of their failure to contain the bidella may well have been profound fear. It explains at least why yesterday the director was asking for the teachers to be assessed for trauma and metal incapacity to perform by psychologists. We'll have to see as this story gets fleshed out to what extent their actions were coloured by the situation they were placed in and what the best reponse is to their role in what happened.

Stephen Covey, author of The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People, states: “Most families are managed on the basis of crisis, moods, quick fixes, and instant gratification – not on sound principles. Symptoms surface whenever stress and pressure mount: people become cynical, critical, or silent or they start yelling and overreacting.” If this is how you perceive a family meeting may progress, it is important to understand that it doesn’t have to. You can have family meetings that are under control and structured. Understand that you will never be able to please everyone all of the time, but that you are not meeting to meet your individual needs but those of your aging loved one.

So Tacheles is soon to close. Who cares? I don't. Well, I do, but only in that what will replace it will be another episode in Berlin's vain chase for the upscale tourist dollar, which is almost certainly bound to fail. Oranienburger Str. has long since lost its hip! edgy! cachet to the pub crawling EasyJetters and mass-market clothing stores. And I care because I have memories of when the area was actually culturally vital, before real-estate speculators moved in and turned Berlin-Tokyo into the Beverly-Hills-on-bad-acid of the Rosenhof. But I've packed away those memories, just like I've packed away the memories of the magazine which was going to bear that headline. As long as Berlin stays poor and cheap, there will be bohemians and artists taking advantage of that fact. And once they've made a neighborhood interesting, the real-estate sharks will move in and the artists will move on and the bohemians will have their tough choices to make again.

I haven’t ran much lately since I’ve been in my “off-season” and I’ve been resting my knees, but I have done 2-3 miles a few time as well as some good cross training so I’m not too worried. I did 2 different 3 mile runs this week, the 1st with a pace of 7:08 and the 2nd with a pace of 7:03. This isn’t as fast as I would normally run 3 miles if I was in training(6:45-6:55 pace), but I’m not in training so I’m okay! Since I only have a week and a half until the race, I’m not really going to set a goal time or pace(although I’d like to have a pace under 7 minutes).

Fearing lawsuits, some libraries and many used sellers did remove older books from their shelves. But the reason your local library may not have a nearly empty children's department is that the CPSC has issued a variety of stays of enforcement and temporary exemptions (plus there are bunch of feisty and renegade librarians out there) - but all these stays and exemptions were set to expire at the end of this year. And every attempt to amend the law or repeal it has failed.

As you know, this weekend we celebrate Easter. To some, Easter is all about pastel colors, eggs, bunnies, new dresses and spring. To me, it's about remembering THE MOST AWFUL and THE MOST BEAUTIFUL event in all of time.
One more day and then it’ll be Christmas eve. I haven’t been a good boy so I will not get any Christmas presents. Santa has me on his banned list. Of that I’m pretty sure but no hard feelings I still like Santa Claus, at least when I watch the Disney special on Christmas eve. This show has been broadcast every year since the early 1960′s or maybe even longer than that on Swedish Public Television. These days I think there are mostly adults of all ages watching because kids have the Disney Channel broadcasting every day of the year lately. For the kids of today cartoons on Christmas is nothing special but it used to be a very big deal for their parents and grandparents even. Back in the days of my growing up there were hardly any cartoons at all on TV so the Disney Christmas special was something to look forward to the whole year. Now it’s a tradition over here. No Christmas without Donald Duck on TV…. So after eating the traditional Christmas food, we gather round the TV set and watch Disney cartoons before Santa’s arrival to deliver the presents.

THE conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. Our invisible governors are, in many cases, unaware of the identity of their fellow members in the inner cabinet. They govern us by their qualities of natural leadership, their ability to supply needed ideas and by their key position in the social structure. Whatever attitude one chooses to take toward this condition, it remains a fact that in almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons—a trifling fraction of our hundred and twenty million—who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind, who harness old social forces and contrive new ways to bind and guide the world. It is not usually realized how necessary these invisible governors are to the orderly functioning of our group life. In theory, every citizen may vote for whom he pleases. Our Constitution does not envisage political parties as part of the mechanism of government, and its framers seem not to have pictured to themselves the existence in our national politics of anything like the modern political machine. But the American voters soon found that without organization and direction their individual votes, cast, perhaps, for dozens or hundreds of candidates, would produce nothing but confusion. Invisible government, in the shape of rudimentary political parties, arose almost overnight. Ever since then we have agreed, for the sake of simplicity and practicality, that party machines should narrow down the field of choice to two candidates, or at most three or four. In theory, every citizen makes up his mind on public questions and matters of private conduct. In practice, if all men had to study for themselves the abstruse economic, political, and ethical data involved in every question, they would find it impossible to come to a conclusion about anything. We have voluntarily agreed to let an invisible government sift the data and high-spot the outstanding issues so that our field of choice shall be narrowed to practical proportions. From our leaders and the media they use to reach the public, we accept the evidence and the demarcation of issues bearing upon public questions; from some ethical teacher, be it a minister, a favorite essayist, or merely prevailing opinion, we accept a standardized code of social conduct to which we conform most of the time. In theory, everybody buys the best and cheapest commodities offered him on the market. In practice, if every one went around pricing, and chemically testing before purchasing, the dozens of soaps or fabrics or brands of bread which are for sale, economic life would become hopelessly jammed. To avoid such confusion, society consents to have its choice narrowed to ideas and objects brought to its attention through propaganda of all kinds. There is consequently a vast and continuous effort going on to capture our minds in the interest of some policy or commodity or idea. It might be better to have, instead of propaganda and special pleading, committees of wise men who would choose our rulers, dictate our conduct, private and public, and decide upon the best types of clothes for us to wear and the best kinds of food for us to eat. But we have chosen the opposite method, that of open competition. We must find a way to make free competition function with reasonable smoothness. To achieve this society has consented to permit free competition to be organized by leadership and propaganda. Some of the phenomena of this process are criticized—the manipulation of news, the inflation of personality, and the general ballyhoo by which politicians and commercial products and social ideas are brought to the consciousness of the masses. The instruments by which public opinion is organized and focused may be misused. But such organization and focusing are necessary to orderly life. As civilization has become more complex, and as the need for invisible government has been increas ingly demonstrated, the technical means have been invented and developed by which opinion may be regimented. With the printing press and the newspaper, the railroad, the telephone, telegraph, radio and airplanes, ideas can be spread rapidly and even instantaneously over the whole of America. H. G. Wells senses the vast potentialities of these inventions when he writes in the New York Times:
Is it his possessions? Is it his career? Why do many fortunate people instead feel unhappy in his/her life?
So, because of the Energy Independence and Security Act, starting January 1, 2012 American companies will stop making and importing 100 watt light bulbs. You will be able to buy incandescent light bulbs after January 1, 2012. 75, 60 and 40 watt incandescents will remain on the shelves until January 1, 2014, as well as a variety of specialty bulbs including three-ways, colored lamps, plant lights and appliances lights. Manufacturers are also working on making incandescents that have higher luments per watt capacity. So no worries – there will always be a large variety of light bulbs for American consumers! As far as purchasing compact fluorescents, remember: always purchase EnergyStar-rated bulbs and install them in compliance with the packaging to get the best performance.

A little bit of research told me a few things. First, I learned that macarons were sandwich cookies. The fillings could be just about anything you could think of. Each side, or shell, of the sandwich were delicate little cookies made by whipping egg whites to stiff peaks, folding some ground almonds and powdered sugar into them, and piping this mixture from a pastry bag out onto a cookie sheet in small circles. Then they are set out to rest for a while to dry out, and finally baked in an oven on a low-ish heat.

As for the beer itself: Has a nice spicy-funky aroma to it, with notes of coriander, astringent hops, teaberry, and a bit of sulfur (pleasant, not off-putting). I like to pour out a little of the dregs on these styles, so it was a nice hazy medium amber color, topped off with a thin white head. The taste was really nice - it's been in the bottle for a while now, and has matured nicely. It's not overly sweet, but has a nice balance of pilsner malt character, dry orange peel, and mild spicy hop character. Dry yeasty after with medium bitterness.

09 Time For A Change
Interview with artists Favianna Rodriguez, Deirdre Baugh
We know the story of Adam & Eve's fall, how they hid from the Lord once they knew they'd sinned. They were both afraid and ashamed. Shame is a direct result of sin and brings condemnation. The devil uses shame & condemnation to keep the sinner in that place of defeat. It was also interesting to see that when the Lord questioned Adam, he began to blame Eve. Eve pointed the finger at the serpent. So we see that sin brings division, which is another by product that the devil uses greatly against God's people. So to sum it up, this is a list of the devils tools:
So I started looking and decided on 5 major cities that I would consider – NYC, Philly, Chicago, DC and home (New Orleans). As far as I was concerned, neither city had a lead over another – they were just cities that I could see myself legitimately living for a few years, with maybe home as the only implied long term destination. I also had some other rules set for myself: the job had to be a move up in my career – so that meant no lateral moves – and I wouldn’t leave my current job for less than $10, 000 more than what I was already making. I didn’t want to be changing positions just to do it, with no real purpose behind it all.
I love following other blogs and getting ideas for decorating my house. I feel like everything I have done in the last 3 months have been because of fellow blogger's.

Professors Arrighi, Hopkins and Wallerstein argued that four changes in relations were “established” as a result of the 1968 uprisings. The military capabilities of the core countries to police the global South became limited; changes in power relations among status groups such as genders and ethnicities “have proved to be far more lasting than the movements which brought them to world attention”; spreading labor unrest has shrunk the areas offering “safe havens of labor discipline”; and dictatorships have been replaced by democratic régimes.

He laughed. (I can always count on him for that reaction.) And proceeded to tell me how his boss had warned him that a visit like this would provoke such a response. Of course, I texted said boss – what, doesn’t everybody text her significant other’s director? – that I had baby fever. And he promptly replied, “That’s what happens after yellow fever.”
After having a huge glass of ice water I noticed I had quite a few lemons in my refrigerator so I made a batch of lemonade. Even after the water it's just what I needed to quench my thirst.

I sticked closely to the sketch this time.
commuting purposes –without a cleat-like rock underneath my sole. I have gone for 2 years straight, in a grand hunt for such shoes whenever I passed a local bike shop or elsewhere on vacation. Maybe now, retailers think more women want to cycle in their high heel pumps, ballet slippers or tall leather boots. I don’t . I ride with toe clips to prevent my foot from slipping off the pedals accidentally.
If you travel or need to have your hands free, these wallets-on-a-chain are incredibly useful. You can wear these messenger style, across your body, or double the chain and wear it over your shoulder. You can tuck the chains inside and carry it as a clutch, or (gasp!) actually use it as a wallet. It has six slots for credit cards, several different zipped pockets, and room for a passport. If you've ever had your purse stolen, or had to spend lots of time in a police station in a foreign country, or had to go to the American Embassy to get an emergency passport, you'll know how good it feels to have your cash, credit cards, ID and passport right next to your body, held in place with a metal chain, in case a thief thinks about snipping through your purse strings. Not that I'm psychologically scarred or anything.
I’m also working on some poured pieces but they go slowly. So while waiting for things to dry there I made more jewelry.

We had a great time talking about zombies. The history; favorite movies, television shows, and books; and why the popularity in modern culture.
Kiahna’s behaviors have grown worse. I have been working with medications yet again to try to help her level out. I thought I had it figured out. Today when she ran from me in church and hit me & told me how much she hated me. It was sheer disappointment that ran through me. I thought I had figured out what was going to help my baby girl.
It’s truly been a life changing and trusty old friend. My Montane Featherlite smock, an original piece in a fetching blue, has finally been resigned to walking history. It may get used on the mountain bike on muddy days but it’s time as THE ‘go to’ garment for outdoor outings has passed. Even at the last however, it hasn’t let me down. Quite stupidly, I forgot to change the temperature setting on the washing machine and the poor old thing had to endure an 80 Celsius wash. An Arcteryx top gave up the ghost, a Saloman shirt disintingrated but the Featherlite came out much the same as it went in… minus a few shades of blue.

While living in Germany for a brief period of time, God brought a fellow American into Heidi’s life and the two of them began getting together informally to share their lives from week to week. At some point in their relationship, she says (excerpted from part 5):

And then there’s Natalie Portman. I’ve never been a big fan, although she clearly possesses enough of an internal life to find the fame game tedious and embarrassing. She receives too many accolades for mediocre performances. She has little range, is often unconvincing outside lonely girl roles. She has an expressive face and wounded, horse eyes, but her voice and her movements always struck me as off. Black Swan was an exception, where she does a superb job playing a professional dancer as both a woman and child, seductress and virgin, at home in the sleazy alleys and on a bed littered with stuffed animals. She was held to the role, though, by the fierce, strangely competitive director Aronofsky.

The good times start in the mouth. Barleywines typcially contain heavy, fruity notes, and the English versions are heavy on the caramel and toffee. In the Perfect Storm, this character is present, but so is the bourbon note, and the two form polarities. In between are caramel, vanilla, maple, toffee. At each pole, you can identify the source, but the two meld wonderfully, and trying to assign some of the flavors--that maple, for instance--to one of the other is impossible. The marriage is complete.

So above we have, from clockwise- red beet salad, Serbian cornbread (Proja) which the owners insisted contain no jaja or mleka (eggs or milk) but I'm a little skeptical. Next to that we have pirinac (rice) with leeks and what may be the national dish of Serbia, Prabanac- beans with paprika and other spices. (Sometimes made with bacon or other meat stuffs so ask!) On the side are some simple grilled veggies. I eat this literally every day and I'm not sick of it yet, which either says something about me or the good food on offer.
What is perfectly clear is that there exists no "desperate need" for federal takeover of local law enforcement. Further, Holder said that about 7,500 hate crimes a year since 1990, averaging one every hour of the day, "is a staggering figure. . .completely unacceptable."

The Golden Compass is the first book in Philip Pullman’s trilogy His Dark Materials, a children’s book that appeals as much to adults because it is just plain exciting.

We arrived at the Chevrolet Service Center around 8:00 AM the next morning, hoping to be finished by 10:30 AM so we could enjoy the rest of the day. Sad to say, we did not get out of there until well past 1 PM, and with only part of the Autopark brake issue corrected. Oh, and it cost us $567 - isn't that nice?
My self-absorbed, evil heart started firing off judgments like an automatic rifle. And without exchanging a word with them, I found myself becoming annoyed by their presence. But when the two men received their food, I noticed they took a moment to pray over it before they began eating. And with that I realized these men I’d been judging so severely were, most likely, my brothers in Christ.
I turned the corner towards Mile 10 and there was Cindi. She gave me whatever I had told her I wanted (it’s all a blur, I’ll do a food recap at some point) and ran ahead w/me to take a photo. Insert selfish thought here “why did it have to rain and my hair look like sh*t?”. I know the marathon is so much more than that, but I don’t look good w/my hair slicked back (and it wasn’t even slicked, I had a couple of small clips up there). Argh.
Sorry folks, I’ve put off discussing my broken gaydar for yet another day, but I promise it’s for a really good reason. Today, I need to talk with everyone about a really important subject. It’s a little-known but rampant Internet illness that could very easily be affecting someone you know and love. It’s not talked about much, but I think we should bring this affliction out into the light and discuss it with honesty and dignity.
So, the last few years, there has been a tax credit that allows a lot of families to get back some of what they end up spending in government and agency fees when they are adopting.
I also wanted to test out my new Gypsy machine and spent ages playing with circles to create the card and all the layers for this card, though it worked brilliantly and the card came together in no time. The stamp is from a Kanban set that was the TSV on QVC last year some time. I just had to play with the freebie backing paper from Funky Hand and used glossy accents on all of the red hearts (could have been a bit neater with that!). I've used another favourite of mine to create the copper coloured dots, which is my Viva Paper Pen - can see me collecting all of them, they're great!
Then I picked her up -- without much struggle, even when she saw where we were going. She did panic when she got wet, but not as much as usual. I think she wanted to be clean, but was frightened by the slippery tub. I hugged her while cleaning her with the other hand, and she buried her face against my shoulder. In her wiggling, she turned so that her back was under the running water, but she didn't move away from it. Maybe it felt nice and warm?

Many will confidently interject in support of civic proselytising of “undeveloped and poor” societies, saying “That is expected” or “That is just natural” or the rhetorical “How can anyone think otherwise?” Becoming more aggressive the assertions will become “That is heartless” or “If you do not believe in this (or that) you are deviant, or a monster, or execrable”.
The smoky assassin murders King Renly Baratheon, sending the camp into chaos with Stannis Baratheon approaching, and Brienne and Catelyn on the run together. The alliance between Catelyn and Brienne is a sensible one; brains and brawn. The two swear loyalty to one another, and it is clear that Brienne, the warrior woman, is going to play a large part in the battle for the Iron Throne, even if she does just want revenge on Stannis for killing her king.

Further books on Russia followed in the wake of his reception into the Church, along with a number of genre-defying humorous volumes, Diminutive Dramas, Dead Letters, and Lost Diaries, in which subtle pastiche, mischievous satire, and sheer farce are combined in equal measure. It was, however, as a novelist that he would finally receive the literary recognition commensurate with his superlative gifts.

Several months ago the leader of our local bereavement group asked my husband and I if we'd speak with a local reporter who wanted to do a feature on Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep. At first, we weren't sure about sharing such a personal part of our lives on TV. Eventually, after some thought, we realized that this was a great opportunity, not only to share Mikayla's story, but to be the voice for many of us bereaved parents who want people to acknowledge the lives of our children more than anything in the world (well...except for having our children back instead).
I don't know if it's kind of freaky or endearing that everything looks the same wherever you are.

We continued on to Needles, CA...thought we'd fill up the tank and throw the generator on so we'd have some air conditioning...the temperature outside was 120 degrees! HOT AS HELL!!! Mel made sandwiches and then went to pay for the fuel. The guy told her we needed all new tires...that ours were baked and just waiting for the opportunity to blow out. After a group discussion, and not wanting to get stuck in the desert if we did have a blow out, it was decided that we'd replace them. We were told it would take a couple of hours and they had an air conditioned waiting area inside we were welcome to use. Gen Rose and I headed in there and Susan spotted a Jack in the Box across the street touting iced coffee and where she promptly headed, Mel was outside eyeballing the tires and talking to the tire guy. She returned a short while later and her phone rang; it was Susan saying the Jack in the Box was air conditioned and not crowded, we should come over there for a while. Of course we did. For a long while! Mel got a bit impatient and headed back to the station to see what was taking so long...Needles is a small town and is one of the first off the desert highway...the station takes care of the gas, food/snacks, and tires...it's a busy little place! Mel is good at being friendly and getting things done and made friends with Sue Ellen, the woman running the food/snack part of the station. We wandered from the Jack in the box to the station several times and generally had a good time visiting with Sue Ellen and watching the comings and goings of others.
These people have tried to explain what Unschooling and Natural Learning mean to them, and I've been encouraged by their example, seeing how they exercise their freedom of choice, to persist in finding my own way of home schooling, without pressure to use the labels in the same way as anyone else ... unless I want to :)
The success of legal reform programs depends on the people who design and implement them. In addition to all the usual criteria (smart, ethical, self-starters, motivated, etc.), they must be trained and oriented to the new, different and unique circumstances they will encounter. They must think about their role, whom they represent, and their relationships with their colleagues. And, it is incumbent on the donors and NGOs to insist on and facilitate this training and orientation.

The last time I spoke to this issue was in June at the American Association of University Presses conference at Salt Lake City where my great friend and client Richard Brown - Director of Georgetown University Press said “This is not a crisis but a transition, a perpetual transition that will become, in time, as natural as the air we breathe.” Richard could just as easily have quoted the Calvinist tag “Ecclesia reformata semper reformanda est!” (Except as the Georgetown University was established by Jesuits – it would be an unlikely choice of phrase.)
I'm not saying that Bourdain doesn't have a point. I think I have said enough times how much I can't stand Rachael Ray. I have been unable to find a single Sanrda Lee recipe that I would ever want to cook (and I've tried). I hate the fact that cooking good decent homemade food is something that is now seen as complicated and elitist. I wish that both the Food Network and the people who watch it would understand that there really is a middle ground between CIA-style cooking and throwing together a box of this and a can of that with a chicken breast. You can create healthful food with a handful of fresh ingredients and just a few basic techniques. It's not as hard as the Food Network wants you to believe. I also agree with Bourdain that we can't be pushing organics as the only food worth living when half the population can't afford such a lifestyle. I agree with him on more topics than you would guess. I just can't stand his presentation or his incredible judgmentalism. It doesn't really add to his argument.

So we encounter a problem. How do we circumvent sin? If it is inherent in us, what do we need to do to reconcile ourselves to our Creator? The bible tells us that the only thing that can bring us back into relationship with God is atonement for sin by sacrifice. Let’s have a look at what that means.

After each visit, potent and meaningful, came the heart of the learning walk experience: the hallway huddle. We gathered outside the classroom and crafted thought-provoking, reflective questions and wonderings, aimed not to offer feedback to those visited, but to spark walkers’ thinking about our own teaching and our own students’ learning. Some examples of questions and wonderings included: I wonder how the teachers’ assessment of student learning will be used to guide further learning. I wonder if students in my own class could answer questions about the purpose of instruction. What are alternative ways in which the interactive whiteboard could have been utilized? What if a learning strategist had not been present as a push-in classroom resource during this particular lesson? I noticed lots of interaction between students and teachers and between students and peers. I noticed the teacher asking “what do you think?” questions. How might seating arrangements impact how students seek assistance from each other? How might different layouts of student activity sheets support learning?
To begin with, it is, quite simply, the most terrifying foot concoction imaginable. I suspect that those vintage buttonholer attachments are more frightening in their inner workings, but at least they tend to have it all neatly contained within that plastic casing.

And the answer is…. I don’t know. All I know is that I have always been this way. I have always been driven to push myself to meet my goals, to keep going even when perhaps I shouldn’t. I have always needed to meet my own expectations, even when others thought they were crazy or a waste of time. As a former teacher, I know that not everyone acts this way, that not everyone is internally driven. So I wonder what motivates some people to push themselves so hard—and I wonder why that inner drive is so hard to quiet, even when people might wish they could?

Ingrid of course uses LOTS of cavalletti in her training. There were mostly dressage riders in the clinic, but some eventers too, which I was really intrigued by. Can a mid 50's woman who's never jumped take up eventing? Maybe the most introductory level? No? Damn. To digress for a moment I do want to learn to do just low, basic jumps, because I think it would be good for both Rogo and I, but that's another story.

Albarn had a long-standing relationship with Elastica frontwoman Justine Frischmann. His involvement with her profoundly influenced his songwriting in Blur in the late 1990s. "Beetlebum," opening track and chart-topping hit single from Blur, is said to be about Frischmann's heroin addiction. 13, Blur's sixth album, presents strong overtones brought about by their break-up. He now lives in Bayswater, London with artist Suzi Winstanley, and their daughter Missy was born in 1999.

I’ve been nominated for a Versatile Blogger Award by Spilled Cookies, The Truth Warrior and Lori Schulz, and the Kreativ Blogger Award by Faith 1st Ministries. I apologize to all of you for how long it has taken me to accept these awards…I am partially to blame, but frankly WordPress is going to have to take a little too. I don’t know if I’m just not doing something right, or what, but I get notified of only the most recent 9 comments. Yes, I get emails…hundreds of them, but I depend on that little orange button to direct me to comments, and it doesn’t seem to be able to count above 9! So, periodically I have to scan through recent posts and make sure I haven’t missed anyone. That coupled with my somewhat ditsy memory, I have let some stuff fall through the cracks. My apologies!!
Once the extensions were in place, I began researching dreadlocks and how to start and maintain them. In my search, I came across articles and pictures of women wearing their hair natural, yet not in dreadlocks. What peaked my interest most were the pictures of women with LONG, NATURAL HAIR! I thought they looked so beautiful, and their hair and hairstyles were gorgeous! So, I was convinced that my hair could look like that too! I, too, could learn how to manage and care for my own natural hair, if I took the time to learn as they did. Hmm!

This year's brood was not so lucky. Yesterday I found the nest--carefully made of moss, dried grass, and hairs from Lexi's white undercoat--on the slate floor of the porch. Its three occupants were scattered around it, dead. Aside from the disproportionately large yellow beaks (put that worm right here, Mom!) they were a mass of gray fuzz. Their lids were closed over their bulbous eyes, and their thread-thin necks were bent at odd angles. I got the broom and swept babies and nest into the mulch. Earth to earth...

On the flip side, brother Tyler Perry’s direction has always been that of telling the same story with different characters. It’s like how, McDonalds takes the same hamburger patties and puts different sauces and vegetables ( I use that word loosely) on them to make them more appealing. When you take that bite ultimately, it’s still the same meat, that many of us consume incessantly to our detriment.

Whatever could be harvested after fermentation will be like a slice in time. It will necessarily have a unique colony of micro-fauna within. More importantly--and I think this is what really chafes Rudi--the process is a huge part of the beer. Those yeasts and bacteria that make Rodenbach evolve from the specific circumstances within each vat. A big part of that has to do with the amount of oxygen that gets into beer, respiration that is determined by surface area (that is, tank size) and wood thickness. If you wanted to make something like Rodenbach, you'd need more than the yeast--you'd need wooden vats and a couple years. And even then, you'd have something distinctive that evolved separately, according to the conditions you had at your own brewery.
They also suggested, while at work, taking the long way back to your desk.

Mydhil Varma’s “The Ping In A Poke” is a funny take on these emails arriving in your inbox with a promise to make you rich overnight. All the stories are contemporary and read like a part of your day to day routine. “Maami Menace” by Pradeep D Raj is a funny story of a pesky old lady. We all can claim to have encountered such a character once in our life time.
Bond: The thought had occurred to me.
“I combine traditional embroidery techniques with contemporary subject matter that explores the in-between moments of the everyday. This work is a series of sewn illustrations, dedicated to the expression of longing, loss and love. They are influenced by relationships and strive to capture a sense of romance and nostalgia. The pieces invite the viewer to connect with the sentiment of the subject and the nature of the characters.
While few people are happy about the coup, nearly every Malian with whom I’ve discussed the coup has expressed relief that Amadou Toumani Touré is no longer in power. From the perspective of many of them, the deposed president’s actions in recent months and years effectively disqualified him from being able to continue running the country. When they speak of these actions, they cite a broad range of supposed failings, from corruption and nepotism, to his apparent unwillingness to fight against MNLA rebels, to various aspects of his character (“A ka kuma ka caa” — He talks too much — is one common complaint). They blame him for all the ills of their society, from an ineffective military to a dysfunctional school system to the high price of staple foods.
like her mama so many times before her, she's been wrong.........
Lunatics… This refers to mental problems… mental disorders… People’s thinking is out of line… This word covers insanity, Alzheimer’s, irrational behavior, loss of memory, intermittent periods of lunacy, wild foolishness and bizarre acts, mental derangement during periods of the full moon, closing of the mind. Jesus wants people back into their right minds. Paul in, 2 Timothy 1:7, talks about a sound mind… Jesus gives people a sound mind.

In short Kunti was quite the matriarch, I bet modern feminist would be so proud of her achievements of having kids with whoever she wanted, though it is been reported in Mahabharata that she had a mantra that she could call upon any god for a “gift”.)
I’ll be the first to admit that I’m in no way an AP activist. In fact, I’ve never and don’t currently subscribe to the general practice of AP myself. We introduced solid food to T at six months old, though he did breastfeed part-time through 14 months, which is rather short time compared to truly devoted AP mothers. T wore diapers until he was three-years-old; EC calls for having kids out of diapers sometime around 12 months. I tried the baby-wearing thing, but after getting frustrated with about a half-dozen of those sling-thingies, I gave up (and T slept just fine in the car seat baby-bucket anyway, thank you very much). T’s vaccines are all up to date, and he’s had his fair share of antibiotics along the way, too, whereas AP-advocates would shy from the AAP recommended vaccination schedule and antibiotics in general. We introduced T to his own crib and bedroom at three-months-old, so obviously we weren’t big on co-sleeping. I shout, use time-outs, and generally am not that familiar with engaging in gentle discipline practices (other than to refrain from corporal punishments, which, yes, we do try our best to avoid). Yet having said all that, I left Sunday’s talk wanting to learn more about the things we might be able to change so we can try to do better – especially in the gentle discipline department – so I purchased Bialik’s book.
Fast forward to 2010, and I have two years of college under my belt. I decided to study abroad in the country that had left me with a new perspective on what the world meant to me two years ago. Being able to visit these places has definitely been a blessing, not just once, but twice and still counting... To see the same places but with revolutionized eyes, the same eyes but with X-Ray vision jajaja.
Offbeat?
But I was also going through a divorce, and all its related tough personal stuff – and I was reading/experiencing a lot of writing/music/art that was helping me a great deal. I wanted a forum to share some of this, too, and explore a bit why it was meaningful to me. I didn’t think the reader of my publishing blog would care in the slightest bit what I thought of some particular piece of poetry! So I decided to just have two blogs.

Asset Disregard - Most people rely on Medicaid for help on their land. This land is typically designated as a provider of quality programs in massage therapy, and that the north dakota home school of missing money websites don't have accurate data, and even the north dakota home school, lignite and natural gas are just few of the north dakota home school does not mean that lenders will be disregarded as to determining the north dakota home school in the north dakota home school and you will definitely want to pay back. Even so, you need a large number of new power and power transmission projects. It would also help to eliminate any doubts. There are gyms like Badlands Gymnastics Club and Three Rivers Gymnastics.
“I Was A Warehouse Wage Slave” by Mac McClelland. It is one of the only funny lines in a grim, essential piece of reporting that makes me grateful that it was written, and will dissuade me from ordering anything from Amazon, which may not be the actual warehouser featured, but which no doubt runs under similar conditions.
2. The Edible Woman – Margaret Atwood. Any Atwood is worth reading. Historians may be more familiar with Alias Grace or The Blind Assassin. Again for the ladies in the crowd, I will merely quote the blurb on the back: “Ever since her engagement, the strangest thing has been happening to Marian McAlpin: she can’t eat. … Marian ought to feel consumed with passion, but she really just feels … consumed.”

“A woman reported her husband missing last night. She said he told her he’d be camping and fishing at Ruby Mountain for a few days, but she noticed after he left that he’d forgotten his box of flies. When she drove to Ruby Mountain to deliver the box, his truck was parked there, but she saw no sign of him. He didn’t respond to her shouts either. She searched for him along the banks for a couple of hours before it got pitch black, then she called in the report.”

New York, NY, May 2, 2008 … The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) today applauded the United Methodist Church (UMC) for overwhelming defeating several anti-Israel divestment resolutions, saying the delegates to the Church's General Conference in Ft.

We are very excited to offer a giveaway this month sponsored by Hometown Seeds. We will select one winner from our site, and Daphne will also select one winner. The prize is an amazing assortment of vegetable seeds from Hometown's Survival Seed collection, a total of sixteen packages of vegetable seeds ranging from beets and pole beans to butternut squash, cucumber, zucchini and sweet peppers. The winner will receive almost a pound and a half of seeds, specially packaged to keep a minimum of 5 years. All the vegetable varieties are non-hybrids which is wonderful if you like to collect and save seeds.
I’m wondering what’s truly more important to these politicians…personal gain or protecting the people? It can be concluded that the former is what’s more important to them, yet it perplexes me as to why when the role of government is to do the latter.
There is a potential downside to making it new. The publishing industry might have problems recognizing its merits, and will definitely have problems marketing it and selling it through channels which are friendlier to industrial product in standard packaging (Pink and pale blue and lime green for chick lit, dark orange flames against black, with gold type, for SAS memoirs… just slot book into package.)
Just shy of six feet, Shea was considered big for a freshman, but even he felt dwarfed as he looked up at John. The pair had been friends forever, and Shea knew that even though John towered over their classmates, he was all heart. The baseball diamond was the only place John ever showed aggression in his passion to win. “Yeah, Mr. Kelley can be harsh,” he agreed. “I can never get all those

Every time I’d brought up the church in the last month, it had turned into a massive argument, and I was in no mood to argue. Coping with my new reality was enough to deal with and yet, my resolve to keep my disaffection silent lasted only a week.
The story is well known. If you account for the last twist to the story, the rest of it is pretty much what you can find in Les Troyens: Aeneas, encouraged by his mother Venus flees the fallen city of Troy and leads the surviving Trojans to the destined land (Nach Rom!). On the way to Rome they land to Carthage where Aeneas meets the Queen Dido who will soon falls in love with him. Their passionate love is short-lived because Jupiter reminds Aeneas of his greater duty -- to lead the Trojan people in the promised land (to Rome). The overly pious Aeneas is torn but eventually decides to follow his duty/faith rather than his heart and left the inconsolable Dido alone... who in this opera does not die but gets back on her feet and marries Iorbas. Of course, there is a whole lot of episodic characters --both humans and Gods-- making the story multidimensional and passionate to follow. The score & libretto (in French) can be found here.

We visited one of Project Renews demining sights outside Dong Ha. This particular area is contaminated with mortar rounds, artillery and bomb, grenades, and hundreds, perhaps thousands of cluster bombs — about 2/3 the size of a baseball and dropped by the millions over both populated and unpopulated areas. Many did not explode, but are deadly ogres and gremlins eager to eat a kid, or someone searching for scrap metal, or a water buffalo. They are a long-lasting feature of Operation Kill-Em-All-And-Let-God-Sort-Em-Out–a body-count obsessed, racism fueled, free-fire-zone enabled, the-only-good-commie-is-a-dead-commie war of paranoia and arrogance. When one of these little gifts gives, arms, feet, eyes, lives and livestock are forfeit. See photo for partial map of Vietnam showing all the (recorded) air and artillery strikes during the war, and lighter photo for partial map of injuries from UXOs since the war.
By the way, can you believe how much difference a shift of position can make in the effect of light on the same scene? The photo above and the one below were taken within seconds of each other, yet look so very different, colour-and-light -- and hence mood-wise.
Many of the viruses and bacteria can survive for hours on the equipment and other surfaces in the gym. This can be a threat to you because of the chaffing and scratches on the skin that regularly occur while using the equipment. This makes it easier for these germs to enter your body. Even though this is a risk, most gyms and strength coaches spend a certain amount of their time keeping your equipment sanitized.
It is very interesting how place names here originated. The uninitiated could be forgiven for thinking the names of all north European towns were loaded into a bag which was then emptied randomly across a map of North America. We travelled through Whitehall, Rutland, and Woodstock before arriving at Hanover. Hanover is home to Dartmouth College which is part of the US Ivy League of universities.

After the tour of the caves we sat down to a tasting guided by the highly knowledgeable and friendly instructor Elizabeth Chubbuck.

More than once, our son has described this sort of “memory” – making his father and I wonder where he was before he came to us, who he used to be, and what sort of spirit he has that is able to be in a hallway thirty years ago, unseen, waving goodbye to someone he’s never met.

Three students of the College of Witching and Whizzing in Ireland are finding out that life isn’t all it is cracked up to be when Lord Saddam-a-mort decides to go on a rampage with all the artillery he could muster up. When their college professor fights Lord Saddam-a-mort, and almost kills him with the Crystal of Darkness, Lord Saddam-a-mort yells out a truth that shatters the heart of Larry, one of the three students that wears thin glasses and always seems to figure out magic without much help from his education at the College. He yells out, “Larrrry, I am your Grandfather.”

Without Home there is no way to define your own people as apart from strangers. And without the ability or willingness to differentiate between the two, you are vulnerable prey to those who can, and very much will, tell you apart from their own.

Nora may not have a formal education, but she graduated with honors from the school of hard knocks. She’s been through tough times and she’ll do whatever it takes to support her family, including helping with harvest time at the Cavanaugh’s orchard. She’s always kept a single-minded focus on staying afloat...but suddenly her thoughts keep drifting back to rugged, opinionated Tom Cavanaugh.
In another example of scriptural reversal, some Gnostic versions of the Creation story of Adam and Eve portrayed the Serpent as Liberator, offering the apple as a means to knowledge unfairly denied to humankind by the despotic Demiurge. There was obviously no way to accept this counter-version and the traditional version at the same time.

I too have mastered the art of swimming without getting my hair wet from years of experience. As my children know, the pool water has to be 85 degrees Fahrenheit or higher for me to plunge in completely. I promise you that the water temperature in the picture was at least this and that I did officially and very professionally snorkel during our week visit in the Maldives. However, on this particular afternoon, after having spent most of the day in the water, I was by then dried off, and the intention was just to walk in the water behind our villa. The temptation was too high to see something that triggered my curiosity in the water. And so my friends, I share this Kodak moment.
In March 2012 the CDT approached Next Limit to ask if they would be interested in sponsoring the final year exhibition, as their software would be included in the exhibition.

After my flyers were delayed from corporate until the day before my launch date and I was already in a state of panic, I was forced to rely on these social media sites to get the word out on this branch that I worked so hard to put together. I thought to myself, “this will never work,” but in the end, I was left with my foot in my mouth. I was pleasantly surprised when after the first week I had accumulated upwards of 10 girls to be on my staff. I was even more surprised when I got my first weeks Traffic Report and got a little more than the average of about 3,500 hits in only ONE week. I couldn’t believe it worked!
The 9th of October 1235 James the first (Jaime I) concurred Valencia. This day is still celebrated in Valencia. It was a reconquest by the Christians.

As expected, all their attempts to woo her are met with failure. In an effort to make doubly sure that his animal magnetism wasn't on the fritz, Fletch takes a second run at her in the parking lot of Ray's pub. After he starts pawing at her, Carla plants the pointiest part of her well-proportioned knee firmly into the creamy centre of the bucther's crotch, causing him to feel a fair amount of discomfort. When she finally does get home, Carla slips out of her disco-inspired one-piece to reveal that she is wearing a pair of black panties with a black bra. You'll notice she isn't wearing black stockings or a garter belt underneath her clothing. This may sound like a bit of a stretch, but I chose to see her decision not to wear any superfluous undergarments as her subtle way of honouring the lingerie loving legacy of her late husband. Sadly, Timmy, who's been watching her get undressed through her window, doesn't pick up on the subtlety of Carla's tribute.

Combination bachelorette party/bridal shower weekends are ideal for groups of friends that are spread out over the country. Since I grew up in Florida, went to college in North Carolina and now live in New York, weddings take me all over the East Coast, so travel has become a necessary part of these events. I’m not going to lie—it’s much more difficult to plan events from afar, but it’s possible! And may I strongly recommend Savannah, GA, for ladies in the South.

I came into film through the theatre. And I came into theatre through my gymnastics. I was a gymnast for 10 years and I hurt my back when I was 15. After that injury, I couldn’t compete and I had a lot of time on my hands. The school drama teacher cast me in a couple of musicals to dance, do the splits and back handsprings. I loved performing and when I went to college I began acting because it was fun. After college I studied with a phenomenal woman, Laurel Smith. It was in her class where I learned that true authenticity in performance is rooted in how willing the actor is to be honest with himself or herself in life. This is what the greats in acting do. And you CAN make a living as an actor.

Steven argues, “Starbucks promotes hate against Americans because they are trying to change George Washington, John Adams and John Jay’s laws. They’re saying we oppose everything that made the USA the USA and we oppose God’s Word so the truth is Starbucks is the one that is trying to change things against God’s Word and against all of the history behind the United States.” Therefore, he suggests that Christians, “make a loud statement saying we do not accept companies opposing God. The real issue is for Christians to love God like our founding father’s did and to want God’s laws to be our laws.”

I dunno. I do believe in academic honor codes, and I think students should experience rituals that reinforce them every so often. It's how I came up: both the Beloved Alma Mater and the University of Basketball were old-school Southern gentlemen's universities, and as problematic as that heritage is in some respects, they did know how to impress upon students that the honor code was a Big Deal. But I kind of think that a culture of academic integrity has to come from the students, not imposed on them from above; and I doubt that one department, without institutional backing, can do much to create that culture.

Well, I did. I got diabetes. I tried his diet but not to the full extent and then suddenly, I had diabetes. That was a hell in its own and I became the most bitter, angry person in the world. Cursing medications, my mental health, the whole world. I would look at skinny girls and immediately hate them. I had become agoraphobic from the weight gain but used EFT (an alternative healing) to help that. But I had been so reliant on my looks my whole life, I loved clothes and shopping, etc that I was paranoid that I would run into people I knew and they would judge me, think I had was just a pig who had let herself go. I did sometimes see people and I would hide from them. I would either leave the place or go to the other side of the store, etc. Sometimes it was unavoidable though, and some people didn't even recognize me when I did say hi out of obligation.
This drink is akin to mint julep, the classic cocktail of The Kentucky Derby (that other May event), in its combination of bourbon, mint and sugar; however, our version is reminiscent of yet another favorite Southern sipper - sweet iced tea. As with most cocktails, the following measurements are really more like guidelines. Please feel free to adjust the amounts of ingredients to create the right flavor for yourself!

I cannot speak for the vampire at the tavern, for I do not know of any threat from him, but only that he told me he has reasons why he cares for humans. If the butcher gives him blood, then that is fine and good. I don’t even know what ye mentioned him for. I saw him treating an injured guard in the hospital, and he was most kind and gentle.
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!
I've found out the sex of my grandchild to be put promised not to say till 20 weeks is passed - need less to say it prompted me to pop out and buy !!!
After the show, we had a quick dinner at South City Kitchen. I say quick because our reservation was for 9:30, and we were late. Oh, and the restaurant closes at 10. We didn't want to be those people who are making folks work late, so we hurried. I took most of my dinner home and had some fabulous leftovers.
One of my favorite water sports is water skiing and wakeboarding. It’s so much fun to glide along the water, being pulled by the speed boat and having the freedom to twist, turn and jump whenever you want.
We did, finally, run out and pick up Max from his wonderful border's. Lou at Sunshine's Doggy Resort has been a godsend. And while I, of course, worried about Max while we were gone, I also knew he is was in great hands. Poor Max, Emi saw him and immediately squealed with joy. Poor Max. :)

This book was even better than her last one! (50 Harbor Street). 6 Rainier is Book #6 in Debbie Macomber's Cedar Cove Series. There was a great twist at the end of this book and then the tease for her next book. I like this series because the books are easy reads, the plot keeps me turning the pages and I don't get tired of cheesiness and over dramatization.The books are about folks that live in Cedar Cove, Washington. It coves their lives as they face tragedy, family difficulties and family triumph. I look forward to reading the next one!

Since I had been not really dressing up beyond an hour here or an hour there (yay! sweats! postpartum!), I really enjoyed getting a dress on (no! need! for! nursing! access!) and chilling with Mr. Dina to watch a movie about other women who love to dress up, too. (And solve problems...and talk about their problems...and get depressed...and create dance craves, etc.)
We’ll be out tonight at a movie night with the kids (Bee Movie – groan), but we’ll be in tomorrow night so that’s the best time to ring. We’re having a dinner party on the night itself.

Muhammad, upon him be peace, was closer to them (believers) than their own selves. The (pagan) Arabs and Jews had formed a united front against them (Muhammad pbuh and his followers) and had put up all their efforts of enmity, standing and fighting against them... and (in fact) they shouted against them from every corner. Then, at that time Allah permitted them (Muhammad pbuh and his followers) the (Jihad) fighting but He did not make it obligatory. He said:

Especially as a leader, this is good to remember. Nobody can find fault if your motives are pure–not doing it for the money, not trying to get rich–even if sometimes we want to get rich for the sake of giving money into the kingdom. God doesn’t need our money for the Kingdom, He has unlimited resources. We just need to be prepared to give it away if He asks. We need to be willing vessels, and the more He can trust us, the more He can trust us with!

I found the text in the Journal of the Scottish Brewing Archive Vol. 3, 2001, pages 31 - 36, though the original source is a document held in the archive. It's a report by A. J. Heslop into the state of the brewery along with his recommendations for sorting out the problems. And there are certainly plenty of those.
And finally, the most exciting news from me these days -- I've been asked to address the Ukrainian Parliament next month! I got a call last week asking if I wanted to do it and I immediately said yes. I'll be speaking about Peace Corps and my experience in Ukraine, as well as working in a Ukrainian village school...all done so on the floor of the Parliament. I'm also supposed to highlight 3 aspects of the Ukrainian school system that I find especially impressive and 3 strategies for improvement.
Example: I spent Saturday at Youth Conference. Came home and the house was completely clean. Floors scrubbed, kitchen clean, toilets gleaming. He said that he just wanted me to come home and be able to relax and not have to worry about the house. Come on now. If that isn't true love is than I don't know what is.
And finally, for now at least (ha!), I took the plunge and purchased the kit from LearningHerbs.com. Hooray! I love herbs and we use a fair bit of herbal remedies, but I get frustrated with my lack of knowledge. I had looked into herbalist classes in the past, but couldn't figure out how to make the time and effort to do that. But this is a kit that takes the learning through project by project. Hopefully, by the end of my kit experience, I will have enough basic knowledge to continue to self-teach until I feel ready to take full-on classes. Or maybe I will be satisfied for a time with my level of knowledge. Who knows? At any rate, my kit should arrive in a few days.

During the war the tavern was taken over by loyalists Charles Loosely and Thomas Elms and was called the Kings Head, until 1780, when it became Brooklyn Hall. Loyalists and British soldiers who occupied New York were said to have fun here, engaging in “all kinds of sporting, such as horse racing, fox chasing, athletic sports, bull baiting, etc.”

She wants to take the Amsterdam job, but hesitates to leave her father . . . and then there’s the handsome troubleshooter who’s just sauntered into the office.
Today Christian Europe is no more and self is the new god, nothing unifies us, not even country, today the very last vestiges of patriotism are sent crashing against Islam and conflict is the only result, can only ever be the outcome. Maddened they are, sent really quite mad, attacked by such a powerful foe and all around them enemies, their very actions in responses garners only more enemies whilst those who stir the pot remain scot-free. The attack now is upon the east, upon the very people and anything that unifies them, I feel for them, sorrow grips my heart, anger races yet I can do nothing, all I can do is sit here knowing the truth whilst all around race here and there.
More than anything, I have learned more about myself throughout this course. I have learned that when I try something new, I feel a sense of pride and the power to teach this to someone new. I never considered myself as technologically savvy, and to tell you the truth, I was scared at the beginning of this course. I was scared that I was not capable to do the things on the computer that everyone else could do. I was scared that I might do the wrong thing. The one thing that I failed to realize was that if I didn’t mess up once in a while or didn’t make mistakes, then I would never learn. I was capable of using these tools and I took more than I could ever imagine out of this class. I appreciate everything I have learned. It has made me a stronger person, educator, and learner. I will use these tools in the future and I now have the drive to learn things I may be scared of!!

It's funny to image the real Mila Kunis, being dragged out to dine at Fette sold on the idea by Hipster Zealots on an obsessive pilgrimage for all things authentic. So many evocative considerations came to mind as a result of that little tag, I figured the best way to go is sharing and letting you decide how the Mila Text should be read. Is it:

A past shrouded in mystery
The same North American Anglicans turn a blind eye to the history of abuses and injustices of prelatical episcopacy in the Church of England and to the role of the bishops in the developments in the Anglican Church of Canada and the Episcopal Church. They prefer to blame the laity for these developments. They turn a deaf ear to those who draw to their attention that the Africans have yet to learn the distinction between episcopal authority and episcopal tyranny. They bring to mind the observation “Those who ignore the mistakes of the past are bound to repeat them.”
The Boers adopted their first flag when they declared their first Boer Republics at Swellendam & Graaff-Reinet in 1795 whereupon they adopted the Red White & Blue horizontal tri colour which was then being used as the flag of the Batavian Republic. This red white & blue horizontal tri colour motif was later used in numerous other Boer Republic flags such as: the Natalia Republic flag / the Lydenburg Republic flag / the Orange Free State Republic flag / the Transvaal Republic (ZAR) flag / & the Utrecht Republic flag. The red white & blue colour motif was also used for the Saltire flags of the Potchefstroom Republic / the Winburg Republic / & the Zoutpansberg Republic.

Right now, each member can log onto the FamilySearch system, find relatives whose work has not yet been completed, reserve them, and take the list of names they have reserved to the Temple to have them printed before taking each name to the respective proxy work. Some people have worked to have large stacks of names, which will often take years to complete, while others who do not have their own names will get names from the general “pool” of all names the Church has that need work.
Gigs are part-time or short-term jobs and gigonomics is the art of juggling several gigs simultaneously in lieu of one fulltime position with benefits. Since this is nothing new for an estimated 1.4 million people in North America (let’s call it Gig Nation), it’s no surprise to see gig-related words creeping into our vocabularies.
in that way, one destroys the SYSTEM at very least on that personal individual level, in one’s own reality / universe. and the more people would do that – the weaker and weaker the SYSTEM will become, and hopefully eventually collapse completely.

Getting back into the habit, and yes it is a good habit, of praying as soon as my eyes open is important. Sometimes we forget that the enemy is waiting for the moment that we don’t pray to come in and try to peck away at our weak areas. I have learned to know when I am on the right track because it seems those attacks come more often. The toothless, roaring, lion is unhappy and he plans and plans to find ways to challenge my path. Learning how to deal with it is a process and I have found it’s also the quickest way to build your faith. Seeing how God responds to your faith filled prayers for more of Him, more of His Spirit, it builds the faith.

In a statement, Ken Hachikian, the chairman of the Armenian National Committee of America said, “President Obama today completed his surrender to Turkey, shamefully outsourcing U.S. human rights policy to a foreign state, and tightening Ankara’s gag on American recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The President’s capitulation to Turkey – on this, the last April 24th of his term – represents the very opposite of the principled and honest change he promised to Armenian Americans and to all the citizens of our nation. President Obama’s pledge to recognize the Armenian Genocide stands today as a stark lie, a painful promise etched on the hearts of all who had hoped and worked for change, but who, today, have been betrayed by a politician who failed to live up to his own words.”
Some years ago, I used to be fairly active on the local amateur dramatics circuit. This all came through one outlet – our local church, where I was one of the pianists in residence. The stuff we did could be divided into two camps: on the one hand, we performed a trilogy of musicals over the course of three years, beginning with Godspell in the millennium year and ending up with Jesus Christ Superstar in 2002, with Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat sandwiched neatly between, usually mounting these big productions in spring and summer. When the weather turned, we would arrange a succession of annual revue and sketch shows at the end of each November, known as Chaotic Chorus.

One day I was browsing the internet, feeling like a complete failure, when I stumbled upon an interview with the popular teen author of Eragon. As it turns out, he had the same problem when he was just starting to write. Eragon is a book that stood on the New York Times Bestseller List for over 120 weeks, so obviously the author got from point A to point B. How’d he do it? Outlining.
While the detail of the animals studied may be more than a casual reader expects, this is not a travel account so much as the tale of an encounter with such animals, and what they convey to the one watching and waiting for them in such desolate and threatened realms.
I of course do modify the system I usually use. I install the browser I like best, the editing tools I prefer and some tools I indeed upgrade or customize completely. How is that different? Well, these are things that I use actively and I am modifying it to how it fits how I work with it. But I already am happy with the way how it works.

After the reception, our group boarded a boat and headed out onto one of the lakes to watch the fireworks show. It was a lot of fun and the crew members really got into it. There were contests for the kids. Nathan won a pirate-themed backpack and Neil ended up with water pistol shaped like a pirate's flintlock. When we returned to shore, we were greeted by Peter Pan himself, who I might add, was quite spastic. I suppose any grown man running around in green tights would have to be a little spastic.

It was even more curious that this light seemed to be responding to us. It would come down like it was looking at us, and then it would go back up in the trees, and unlike the firefly, the thing would blink on and it wasn’t like a little bitty firefly, it was, I’d say, two or three inches in diameter, and it would stay on for like four or five seconds. And I’m beginning to think this is not acting like a firefly.
The fatwas typically cited the Sanskrit chants that often flowed through yoga sessions, and which can be considered Hindu prayer by some in the Muslim faith. According to “Yoga in the Hindu Scriptures” by H. Kumar Kaul, who has written numerous books on yoga, yogic principles were first described in the Vedas, the Sanskrit scriptures that form the backbone of Hinduism, and are considered to be over 10,000 years old.

The fact is that to critique Romney over what he said, to take his quote out of context, to say it is wrong to say that making the prosperity of the middle class your primary concern is the worst and most villainous type of populism (Newt) and socialism (Barry), and behavior totally unworthy the head of any state.

I'm sure many of you know Archie Moore had 131 knockouts throughout his career. As if his 185-23 record wasn't astonishing enough, Moore also fought in to his mid 40's where he wasn't he prime self. If he would have retired at a younger age, he wouldn't have the losses to Muhammad Ali, Rocky Marciano, Floyd Patterson, and others. But his skills were by no means deteriorating at that point. The last 10 fights of his career he achieved a 7-2-1 record. In todays day and age, that may not be considered a decent record but for a fighter in his mid 40's fighting top competition, that's an amazing way to end an already great career.
There was also the reality that hit during focused group conversations that there are also problems that need to be addressed in rural communities that weren’t touched on at this point: poverty; crime; infrastructure; food deserts; building trust and interfacing with university, college, and other partners, etc. Overall it was a thought-provoking conference and has the feel that several small steps can be achieved in the coming year. I would encourage you to check out the Web page and follow the Facebook page. You can also check out the Twitter Conversation at #RFC2012. This conference was also not just focused on Nebraska as the focus was the Great Plains and people from numerous states attended. I’m looking forward to seeing the small executable steps that will occur in the future and am also looking forward to doing my part to maintain strong rural communities as I’d like to see the next generation enjoy the rural life and learn the values I did growing up!

Dad wanted "The Ususal". The dish of two eggs, two slices of bacon, home fries, and a biscuit is $8.95 on weekdays. Most other dishes are around $12, including my frittata. It's a bit pricey, and worth it for it's charm and good food. We both enjoyed our breakfasts.
Hello and happy Monday to everyone! Hope your weekend was lovely and that you are having a great start to the week. The weather where I am today is looking chirpy, sunny and bright, which is a beautiful change to the torrents of rain I've been seeing everywhere :) I'm not a fan of this whole El Nino shift in the world's weather patterns - apparently some places are experiencing extended summers (yay for that!!) while in other parts (like in Australia) we are suffering from overdue winters.

There was a time when it was very difficult to reconcile my working and mothering selves. I returned to paid work six years ago when my eldest was a toddler and I seemed to straddle a particularly savage divide. I arrived everywhere harried – to the train station in the early morning with my child, stroller, and our multitude of bags; to the daycare centre with my child in tears; to my desk with me in tears; and then back again in the evenings to the daycare centre and the train station and home. Rinse and repeat.

“As all of you are doing your reporting, I think it’s important to remember that the positions that I am taking now on the budget and a host of other issues. if we had been having this discussion 20 years ago or even 15 years ago … would’ve been considered squarely centrist positions,” Obama said a few moments later.

In the plummeting darkness, the man's own anxiety began to mount. He could feel it gathering in the blackening chill: the aching certainty that already, only one year on from the separation, he has lost his son, his child. And the thought grew so strong that he could only half-listen to the child's earnest desperate voice.

Remember them? Recently, I have been seeing them alot in the advertisement and on T-shirts. Is the fad back or it didn't even fade. I don't know, I am out of touch. Only after I had kids did I revisit all those familiar cartoon/book characters I once knew so well during my childhood. Taking in orders does has its advantages, though it meant less sleep; it gives me the opportunity to attempt stuffs that I don't usually do. I do enjoy challenges. Even more, when customers came back with positive feedback, telling me that the cake brought smiles to their kids.
But a couple of decades later, my statement that the Bulldogs are my favorite team is a true sign of commitment. (Cheering for them over the last few seasons has given me cause to think that perhaps I need to be committed.)

Well, okay, I admit that I am not un-organized. With the right amount of space, enough time, and the appropriate tools, I am even more organized than I usually am today. However, ample space, time, and tools currently do not apply to our situation. We are living in a house that "needs work," not to mention, needs more room, and I deal with migraines (which affect my ability to think and function) regularly. Both of these things have caused me to be a "seat of the pants" sort of teacher in recent years, meaning that I use whatever resources I have from day to day to get something useful done.

I LOVE these 2 layouts
This series essentially started out as an experiment in style more than substance. I wanted to consciously get away from the finished looks of recent works, and go for something raw and visceral, just let my hand and eyes do the work regardless of detail, precision and realism. (“If I wanted it to be perfect, I’d be a photographer” is probably the most oft-repeated line in my artistic lexicon.) I also wanted to experiment with layers as well. To add colour over and under the main image to get a sense of the possibilities and limitations. (And despite being “water-resistant”, the inks do end up bleeding into one another regardless of dryness.) I thoroughly enjoyed the end result in terms of style and look, so much so that the series might well continue over time, and I’ve already made plans to reapply the same methodology to a series involving local, Québecois tabloids and celebrity magazines.
Here are a few that I tried:
1. When you live in a house like this, you just can't go traditional. I take that back, you can't go FULL on traditional. I think these yellow kitchen pendants would be the perfect POC to shine on you while you prepare apps for your guests (this is totally a cocktail party house)
He held me tightly in his strong arms, afraid to let go, and kissed me full on my mouth.
The times have changed. Our wartime leaders are vilified by an opposition party which neither understands the stakes involved nor offers a viable alternative other than "cut and run." Our mainstream media reveals our secrets with impunity and disseminates enemy propaganda in the name of the public's "right to know." Many of our fellow citizens are neither willing to support their country's effort or the men and women serving in that effort. Sadly, in 21st century America, there are too many who believe that any sacrifice in the name of freedom is never worth the cost and they look down upon those in our society who do. For many, military service is relegated only to those, unlike themselves, who lack other options or who lack the common sense to avoid it.
The great day-to-day faith challenge is believing in newness in a broken world where past failures suck everything downward.

The other day, when I was out of my pen browsing, mean Esmeralda, the miniature donkey, chased me and chased me! Candy told her to stop but she wasn't listening! It was hot and I got very tired and Candy was concerned that I might have early labor because I was humping up a bit that evening but everything is okay now."
Or did I just catch Tribute in different 'mood'? If I've discovered anything about beer over the years, it is that lovingly crafted ales do often vary slightly in taste, texture and overall impact - and I've long-since referred to these variations as changes of mood.
Once low self-esteem is formed, the person becomes hypersensitive — they experience “self-esteem attacks” that take the form of embarrassment or shame, Sorenson adds.

Since 1997 the changes affecting Britain as a direct consequence of the imposition of the doctrine of multiculturalism have been deep and far-reaching. They have changed this country overwhelmingly for the worse. The Conservative Party has done nothing to stop this Soviet-style agenda from being imposed. When, in the aftermath of the publication of the Macpherson Report (1999), the police were targeted and accused of being institutionally racist, William Hague, whose favourite pose is that of a straight talker, accepted the report’s findings in full. Later, during the 2001 general election campaign, when the outgoing Conservative Member of Parliament for East Yorkshire, John Townend, highlighted his constituents’ justified fears over mass immigration, Hague denounced him.

“Jabotinsky died shortly after you arrived in the US, but you did not lose hope and approached dozens of senators, congressman and American leaders such as (Dwight D.) Eisenhower. You told them that the Jewish state would be established and that it would not be defeated by the Arabs,” the PM said.

Of course, no one doubts that a few years ago senior journalists at News International got far too intimate with some senior police officers, and there may have been criminal collusion. If so, prosecutions must follow.

As there was still lots of snow on the ground this morning, and it was rather chilly out, I really layered up:
It seemed all of nature was heralding spring today. I saw the first oystercatcher. He is a couple of weeks early I think. The songbirds were boisterous all day and all the summer birds will show up soon. I took advantage of the balmy weather and sat outside this evening absorbing the smells of spring, the songs of the pinkletinks, and the low moan of the fog horn.
No matter how we approach life, it keeps moving forward. Such is the nature of time and our ride along with it. As such, we now enter the holiday season. Thanksgiving has come and gone, and I hope you found time to reflect on some of the things in your life you can be thankful for. I, for one, am very thankful to be surrounded by my family and friends who love and support me. I am thankful that I have found myself back in a career that challenges and fulfills me. I am thankful for the friends I have made over the past year in the craft beer community, and how much I have learned.

A HA! I remembered! Only exchange money at official place. We have official exchange stalls now; namely KBZ Bank, AGD Bank, etc. They have reasonable exchange rate and the rates are government regulated so it is guaranteed that you get fair price. If some dodgy guy tells you that they can give you at higher rate, please don’t follow them. I have heard horrible stories and I don’t want you to become a victim. If you decide to follow a dodgy guy despite my warning, I wish you good luck.
Women and young, teenage girls who have probably read this novel about 20 times will probably love this movie to death because that’s the audience it’s mainly for. However, I am not that audience and that was the biggest problem here. Every single character in a Sparks novel are about as one-dimensional as a piece of paper but are still treated like as if they can do no wrong, with barely any flaws whatsoever.

So as a follow up to last weeks post I would like to include all the great suggestions to last weeks post plus a few other ideas that I came up with.
My daughter and I were at the mall to view the art exhibits of local schoolchildren, hers included. She was eager to see it, as was I. Her piece was a mixed media collage of what she dubbed the "Silly Bot", a whimsical creation of metallic foil paper, markers, crayons and pens. The Silly Bot, as one would expect, is a robot in a silly pose, flanked by a bird in a cage (wearing a party hat), a small stage (what she dubbed the "joke stand", a small platform complete with microphone) and the "Amazing Flying Zebra", an airborne zebra wearing "rocket boots" (complete with flames) to boost it into the sky.
It took less than two seconds to fly the whole height of the tower, but the crescendo of adrenaline slowed it down, prickled her to distraction with unnecessary sensations, sensations she couldn't afford; the wrinkle in Jashi's dress that was going to leave an angry red line across her cheek, the ever-so-slight tingle of pinched circulation where the other woman's arm pressed tight against hers.

After the elections of 2010, where we lost everything on the council and got a derisory vote in the both the parliamentary seats of Barking, and Dagenham & Rainham, it transpired that the then National Elections Officer, the Chairman and possibly other key national head office officers had made the decision to deselect me from Barking, not for my alleged ‘drinking’ nor for dyslexia, but because they could not allow someone of my high profile to take the possibly only parliamentary seat in the country. In other words they didn’t want me to become the number one person in nationalism in the Britain. Pathetic!

If you ferment in plastic buckets, as I am doing more and more, you just drill a hole in the bucket, install the spigot and backnut which then sits just above the yeast and trub that settles out of your beer when it's done fermenting. To transfer your beer into a keg or bottling bucket, just sanitize a piece of tubing, squirt some sanitizer up into the spigot, attach the tubing, turn the handle, and Presto! your beer runs effortlessly into your keg. No messing around with siphons. As I've mentioned before, between a family of six, a full time job, a farm, and church responsibilities I'm trying to optimize my brewing set-up for speed. This is another nice notch up for me.

But is it a planning consideration? As well as loss of employment, impact on local amenity and infrastructure, traffic and access, inappropriate development, I think the planners should look at the effect this new housing estate will have on Bridport as a whole. You can’t just look it as bricks and mortar. It goes wider, deeper than the aesthetics of the new properties.

- Speaking of DRM, author Charlie Stross makes a passionate argument that killing DRM is the way for publishers to compete with Amazon, enabling readers to "to buy books from a variety of outlets and move away from the walled garden of the Kindle store." This is a MUST READ post for anyone who's concerned about the future of publishing.
I liked Payne. She’s a tough warrior, and I liked the chemistry between her and Manny. This book was supposed to be their story, but it was Vishous who stole the spot light.

That's disgusting. Fear is not a weapon that has any place in education about our bodies and the misinformation that abstinence only education is spreading has obviously only done harm. Teen pregnancy and STD rates have gone UP in places that only use abstinence only education, and provide no useful information about how to actually protect yourself or your partner. No matter what you believe about the value of virginity or saving yourself until marriage, you DO NOT have the right to LIE about life-changing and potentially life SAVING methods of contraception or abortion. Preach all you want about the 'moral' problems with it...but do not present that view as the one and only 'fact' to be found on the matter.

Please start using Steve whenever you come into the bar and we will know what you mean. It is really funny when you hear us talking about it and if you need further instruction then you don't have a sense of humor. SO remember use Steve the Shark as much as possible and make him a trademark name for us!!!
There have been a couple of thousand comments in Malay on YouTube to this. DAP followers should read these responses as the public reaction bears closer examination.
But just like real people, all of these characters are more than just one thing; they aren't simply good or bad, and bad choices don't automatically make you a bad person. Poppy doesn't like all of the choices she's making, but she doesn't know how to stop herself, or who to trust. I honestly don't know if I've ever imagined shoplifting like a drug before, and how this kind of behavior can affect and change a person's life. I think Lifted gives a real and honest portrayal of how easy it can be to make bad choices. Wendy also does a great job of giving Poppy a relateable voice, with a sense of humor. It really endeared me to the character whenever Poppy would say something angsty, right before she shared her truthful feelings with the reader.

The writers group to which I belong is moving ahead on its anthology. What started out as a collection of fictional stories, each under 300 words, has morphed into something else. Now there will be microfiction, flash fiction, short non-fiction, short short stories and poetry.
So, yeah, I understand that the previous paragraphs read like a Bell's promotion, but seriously, barring the Xmas Ale, of which I have no opinion as of yet, all are favorites of mine, and are available locally, both in cases and in six-packs. The only thing that's missing is a Bell's tap in Indiana, which will hopefully be remedied soon.

One thing I enjoy is my French breakfast--a fresh baguette with butter and jam. Yes, I buy a baguette every day for dinner, but I during the week I never get to enjoy fresh bread at breakfast. So on the weekend, it's a treat to make a bakery run in the early morning, and come home to enjoy a fresh baguette with butter and jam.
Ally was not quite two years old when her mom again encountered the father of her child at a nightclub one evening. She brought him to my house that night to take a peek at their sleeping child, and then arranged a visit for them later that week. He seemed to be happy to have his daughter in his life, and his mother was even happier. After all, Ally was adorable. She was a bright and engaging toddler who warmed the heart of everyone she met. His family fell in love with her instantly and enthusiastically welcomed her into their fold. Incredibly, his wife was gracious and accepting of the child, at which I have always marveled. Whether she was truly a saint or the victim of her domineering, stereotypical Hispanic husband, I am not certain. She had a son only 22 days younger than Ally, which explains why he was unwilling to take responsibility when he learned of Christina’s pregnancy. After several visits I hoped that he would continue to be enough of a presence in Ally’s life to give her the security and connection with her father that every little girl needs. I knew her life would be difficult, and I dreaded the day when she would learn the details of her birth, but as long as her dad stayed in her life, she would know who she was and that she was loved by her father. Christina didn’t see it that way. When she had become pregnant, she was unable to wrangle him away from his girlfriend. She no doubt hoped she could now seduce him with the darling princessa they had conceived together. When that didn’t happen, Christina had little use for her daughter’s father. By now she had met Mr. Charming, a handsome and sensitive man with personality plus and several years her senior, and she cut off all contact between Ally and her father. She told me that Ally had said she no longer wanted to visit her dad, and I believed her.

Of course as in most reactionary coup de tate’s, the middle class comes out in full force in an effort to ensure that the voices of the truly oppressed are either marginalized or eliminated completely as in the case of the fart smeller movement. This is why there has been no effort made to promote unpopular causes, even the Obama Bin Laden Administration realized that the biggest problem in our society is school bullying for example, this is where the schools function as a way of training what in Nazi Germany were called Hitler youth. Anyone who is seen as compassionate or weak is called gay and is bullied, the Obama regime is using this real issue simply for winning over regular people to the cause of radical Islam, but there is no one really speaking out for the fart smellers, the freaks, and the gays aside from the Humanitarian Socialist Party.

You know, I was just going to complain about the romance when I realized that I was doing it on autopilot. I suddenly remembered that there are more characters that I need to hate upon, or worship in my own obscure way. Claire annoyed me rather a lot, in the previous book. She was not in much of this book, but for the parts she was in, she seemed much less weak and surprisingly less dull. For this, I can thanks the book gods. (Because there is definitely a higher power reining over the authors imagination, other than the authors imagination.) However, this is a twist. Claire revealed herself as a Twilight fan. I almost liked you, Claire. Even if you did hate Breaking Dawn, you shall not be forgiven for your sins. You will have to suffer the torture of bad shojo manga to repent from your sins, in a fanfiction that I will put together sometime soon.
At this point I am relieved we are finally out from the pressure.

He was asked him about a construction site at 80 DeKalb Avenue nearby. “He said he didn’t know anything about that building,” Doyle recounted, noting that, within two days, she found online a rendering of FCR’s planned building.
Rayanne is a MASTER dater. In the days (and with Rayanne usually months) leading up to sex, Rayanne can command a potential boyfriend like a snake charmer controls a python. It is an incredible sight to behold. She has them dropping her off and picking her up and paying for flowers and holding doors and sleeping next to her, but not ‘touching’ anything. I swear, this is the case. I call this process her “Mormon plan”. I’m always saying to her, “Oh, are you putting that poor guy through the Mormon plan?” And she always is. There’s always some poor soul, WILLINGLY, participating in the Mormon plan. It’s a strenuous program for these guys, let me tell you. I don’t know how they survive it.

She took issue with a lady who seemed to think she was a size 8 but was in fact, not. By any stretch of the imagination. She was wearing a pair of low slung black capri’s, and a pink running top, that was so tight it didn’t get past her belly button, so she was running with a good 4 inches of space between her capris and the bottom of her top. This ‘space’ was hanging over the trousers, all the way around. She was also making a spectacle of herself by waving manically at the race photographers whenever she spotted them along the route (simply not the done thing when you’re racing a serious distance). I watched SuperSarah’s face change. We dropped pink lady at mile 13, and raged on all the way to the finish (‘Why are we doing this on a Sunday morning? Where are our social lives? Oh that’s right, they don’t exist anymore!’).

Nearly all of the newspaper’s budget is funded from a member item earmarked by Lopez ally, state Sen. Martin Dilan (D–Bushwick), who contributed $70,000 in funds last year to the enterprise — about half of his $135,000 total allocation to Ridgewood Bushwick programs.

Every day I’m writing in this notebook, the last thing before I go to bed. I write on both sides of one sheet every day, although some days my handwriting is smaller and some days I don’t do more than one or two lines on the second page. It’s a journal, rather than a diary, because although the entries are personal to me they’re not an account of what I’ve been doing, they’re thoughts on certain things.

So in about a week, I'll be headed off to college (you probably guessed that by now.) I'm actually going off to real college- not community "let's pretend this isn't just like high school all over again" college. Which probably means I won't have as much time to spend here trolling people. And not just because I'm off banging chicks.
Riley's IEP meeting is next week. I think I will always have some anxiety about these type of meetings but I'm also excited for it. I want to see what the next round of goals will bring. Its always interesting to me to see what the next steps in the progression of his development are. For example I know that I want him to talk but there is a process to speech therapy. Which sounds should be developing in which order and so on. I find it super intriguing. Some days I wonder if I shouldn't go back to school for special education or speech therapy. I think it would be fun change of pace... and then the thought of school shakes me back to reality.

We’ll be meeting in Classroom B, in the Center for Museum Education, so you’ll want to use the Portal Entry in the Carnegie Museum of Art parking lot. When you walk through the first set of glass doors, Classroom B is on your right. You’ll get a brand-new discussion guide that contains the vision, which you’ll have a chance to read and comment on in small groups. We want to make sure that the vision we came up with matches the direction you told us you wanted to go, so your response to what we’ve come up with is a vital part of the process; we just can’t move forward without you.

Sierra Nevada Torpedo - Torpedo was probably the first beer that really got me interested in the American IPA style, so when I heard it was coming to cans this year, I was pretty excited. And not just any cans, but 16 ounce cans. While I'm still baffled by the use of the word Extra in this beer's name (so, it's Extra India?), it's one of my favorite offerings from Sierra Nevada. A little bit sweet with big flavor and a nice hop punch, this also comes in at 7.2% ABV, so a 4-pack of these will do you quite well before a game.

Judge Sexton said the law was intended to protect young girls too immature to make proper choices about sexual activity and deal with the consequences.
And yet that “latest possible” time came and went also, and there was no more May 21 anywhere in the world. Harold Camping and his followers created and launched their Titanic Theory, it finally crashed into an iceberg of reality, and it sank. But of course an abstract “time” is not the same as a tangible boat. So they didn’t “go down with the boat.” They just sank … deeper down into Titanic Denial. And … the saga continued.
When I was working on Photoshop in school and I had to go, I realized that I needed one important thing, That thing was a USB drive. I lost my USB drive a while back and didn’t really find it necessary to get another one but working in school made me realize that I did. The photshop files are to big to send thorugh email because of all the layers so instead I had to convert the file to a .jpeg and lost the layers. This is very frustrating because I had organized my photshop layers in a way that I could use them to finish the drawing and no that I was stuck with just a .jpeg, I had to reorganize everything. So USB drive had mae to the top of my list with a book called Figure Drawing for All It’s Worth by Andrew Loomis. The book I hope will help with my figure drawing and poses, especially hoping it helps my terrible female drawings. So I will place an order on Amazon.com and I will write about it when I get it.
Summer is here. Not much time to post sadly. I have the foot and the collar done for my keggerator. I was going to put sides on it, but I read that the sides of the freezer are made to disperse heat. Not sure if that 1/8th inch of wood will damage it. I am waiting to find out. I have some pictures, but I don't have them formatted yet for this. I will probably post them when I get the faucets for them.

Perhaps the great “published work” is a self that develops an improving sense of perspective and of the sacred. Thus, reading, studying, and writing are components in a construction project. Aspiring to be at once observer and practitioner causes us to “be more than we are.” An invaluable pursuit, at many levels, and the type of path worthy of plotting, mapping, and travelling.
We painted our front door with leftover paint from the pantry redo and added our Ram sign to finish it off.
The hike, about 2-3 miles, was a little steep (and muddy) at times, but once we got to the top the view of the city was beautiful and peaceful! Jesse and I had a little bit of time to sit and reflect and it was wonderful. I'm so glad we all went. Once we got back it was about 11:30 and we all decided to save cake for Saturday since we were tired.
Moving to the northwestern wilderness of Maine to a valley surrounded by tree covered mountains. Our backyard lake reflected the surrounding various colors of the mountains during spring, summer, and autumn each season. During the winter months the lake and the mountains were snow covered contrasting with the clear blue sky from horizon to horizon.
The good news is that the sudden attention has caused supermarkets and fast food chains all over the U.S. to announce they will no longer use pink slime. In South Florida, the list includes Publix, Costco, Winn-Dixie, Target, Whole Foods, Wal-Mart, and Sam’s Club, as well as McDonald’s, Taco Bell, Burger King, and Wendy’s (which said it never used pink slime in the first place).

According to a recent article in the NY Times (attached below), the practice of yoga in New York City is experiencing a similar narrative, especially in Muslim dominated areas, such as Jackson Heights in Queens, an area that I have visited several times. Muslims are much more sensitive to avoiding anything that might be inconsistent with their fealty to Islam, and the article examines how practitioners of yoga are “Seeking to Clear a Path Between Yoga and Islam.
We mouth these three simple words to people in passing, on greeting cards, and even when someone sneezes! We've said it and heard it so often that it's become another hollow expression we toss back and forth, limiting it's power to "Have a nice day!" But let me tell you, this is no trite cliche'!
Abandonados, but not by choice. These four little ones arrived at the Santa Catarina clinic in a costele (coffee bean sack), their littles eyes not even open. The woman who brought them literally dumped them on the floor with a thud heard by everyone in the waiting room. After all the appropriate questions were asked, like “where’s the mother?” and “will you take us to her?” it was determined that the woman had no intention of helping the newborns. Before walking out of the clinic she said that as far as she was concerned the puppies could all die. We believe that she probably thought she was doing a good thing by leaving them with us.
And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
Patchen essentially lived upon the economic lifeline of Brooklyn with his two adjoining lots on Fulton near York St. He was a butcher, and according to a contemporary who recollected Patchen to an Eagle reporter, “he was never known to own but one pair of leather trousers at a time. These he wore until they were so smeared with dirt that they were unpresentable.” His home, “a quaint and ancient oak framed, scallop shingled house,” was reported to be at least 150 years old by the time he moved into it.
The planning for 2016 needs to start immediately after the results are in on 3rd May, and appealing to black Londoners with credible candidates should be central to the party’s approach.

And, of course, I have my routine. And like anyone with a predictable routine, the idea of having it shaken up and turned upside down is scary.
“What’s done is done,” Beck stated calmly. “Nothing can change that. Our food problem is solved…that’s the bottom line.” Absently pointing his pistol in Peart’s direction, he applied his best, most-practiced look of authority. “You and Steinman take the body to the galley and get it prepared. There’s a world-wide reception awaiting us when we finally reach home. A hero‘s welcome.”
‘Forget You’ has more mono-toned delivery over the top of a looped, stark, chimed guitar and plodding beat, while ‘Take Your Time’ opens quietly with a very familiar guitar line (I think it reminds me of ‘Susan’s House’ by Eels) before becoming more expansive as it progresses.
If you're inclined to give soil blockers a try, you will need to invest in some additional equipment. I have a couple, but haven't actually used them yet. I've chickened out (for various reasons). However, Stephen McGehee of The Southern Agrarian has a couple of great posts here and here. I am referring you to him for further instructions on that topic. Even if you don't think soil blockers are a fit for you, do check out his blog! (And someday, I'm going to get brave and give soil blockers a try!)
Part 2: Patient Observation
How does this make you feel? Have you ever sold yourself short, and not given yourself the full price that you justly deserve.
Then you grow up, and the adventure becomes a Herculean trial – but you’re not Hercules so you put-put along until you scrape through praying it was enough. And that’s just ONE day. More and more things are piled onto an already high plate by parents, friends, co-workers, bosses, banks, mortgage lenders, societal expectations, …… It’s a long list of “caring” people, and as the mountain grows you begin to notice that quite a few of the things on it aren’t things you want for yourself but are expected to get anyway. The world calls those things “responsibilities” and tells you that “they’re grown up things” and “you’re an adult so you have to”.
Back in 2005 an account in Chia’s own name, managed by HSBC Hong Kong, registered a regular monthly standing order payment for Musa’s son, Mohammed Hayssam Musa, who was studying in Perth.
On Ash Wednesday 2012 controversy stirred once more in the seven year Murder Investigation which has fraustrated legal minds from different Political Administrations – as the daughter of well-known San Fernando Businessman Padlo Roopnarine appeared in the San Fernando’s Magistrate’s court as part of an ongoing custody battle with ex-husband Damian Ramsajan.
But that’s by no means represents the extreme edge of eco-fascist sentiment that has been expressed in recent years.

3. All You Wanna Do Is Dance – 3:40
Hey everyone! I am very sorry for not yet posting anything since last December. A lot has happened withe Yankees since my last post. Here’s a look at some of the off season moves and how 2012 looks for the bombers.
I went to a church rummage sale last week with my friends Karen and Suzanne. On the way home we passed this house, and Karen pointed out that it was for sale. She had been looking around on a real estate website days before and there it was. She was shocked it was for sale as well. It is a favorite of hers too!
Personally I really like room sprays... because I hate it when eg the smell of food lingers when you're not hungry. Also, if I'm expecting somebody, I like to make sure my home smells nice - they should notice as soon as they walk in.
It's an interesting idea -- but already, even in season 1, I'm wishing they'd take it further -- and be a little more subtle about it. I don't think that the writers here are going to leave me high and dry the way the writers of Supernatural continually do: "Oh, here's an interesting---oh, shit! oh, shit! something controversial! Padalecki's acting skills can't cope! Retreat! Retreat!" (All said in a kind of quasi-Dalek voice, of course.) At least Dead is willing to talk about things like is suicide an acceptable alternative in this world? Okay, granted that it is, what about someone unconscious in a life or death situation (non-zombie related)? Okay, that's a bit blurrier so lets make it fun: what if it's a kid? What if someone does something really bad to get medical supplies so the kid can make it?
Whichever way it now works out -- that is, whatever political bribe, public or private, is or is not, paid to the Chinese to resolve the mess -- one thing is clear. Usama bin Laden's death is not going to save this President's catastrophic foreign policy.
Last Monday I performed at Gotham Comedy Club’s open mic night. I didn’t throw up and no one physically threw a tomato at me, so I marked it down as a success in my diary.
**UPDATE: Upon reading this, Steph sent me the following email that I think I should include because it's funny: "You forgot the part when I asked Jered why he wasn’t bringing fire crotch to the wedding and he told me “it just wouldn’t be appropriate” to which I responded “Oh but f*cking her behind Amber’s back for several weeks after Amber specifically asked Laine NOT to go after you was appropriate”?"***
So, without fail after my breakfast shift at the Taj, I would take off and reach my chosen destination, The Ramada Pub.

One of my major complaints may be odd. The smell of the Cinnamon Spice Toasted nuts and the choking aroma of a grill, smoldering in the air. I'm trying to sample beers! I don't want to be mixing Cinna-Bon aroma nuts and fusel grill smells with my samplings.
Nail polish is actually the best way you could give your fingernails and both your hands an artistic look. Face as well as hands are the most exposed parts of the body, so while you pay much focus on making your face look lovely, you need to make sure that your hands appear equally good. Actually, lots of people judge you by the manner in which you maintain both your hands.

Prokopian maligning and persecution of the true Reality Community — specifically of thoughtful whites of Christian heritage who have managed to scrape the scales off their eyes, knows no bounds.
The next little thing is Sfrona with a grass skirt and coconuts on. We got this for Reagan when she came to Hawaii, and I kept it for no reason! Sfrona found it and now she dances like LELO in the movie! It is hilarious!
Staring at the wall while taking a piss
A part of me says I should simply accept that summer wasn't so good this year and look forward to autumn, but a part of me still hopes for a few more summer days. And what's life without a little bit of hope...?!
The final weigh in and measurements were upon us and I was really motivated in that last week.

Well, I could tell you, but that would just involve a lot of random chatting about mildly (and also possibly only to myself) amusing anecdotes about golfing and everything to do with golfing, stuff about my ma, pa and wee brothers (and their significant others) and they have firmly placed themselves on my 'do not write about us you frikken ungrateful child/ not from the same seed sister' list anyhoo, more stuff about bears in my backyard and what kind of meat they would imagine me as, and other such greatness that, needless to say, I won't let you in on those tidbits of great insight and even greater awareness, but instead will again pretend like my last post was yesterday (and involved me talking about my lowering my handicap three times in one week and how I then cried and then weirded myself out totally by caring so much about a sport but then ultimately deciding that golf was really more like a guilty pleasure involving balls and shafts and thus much more like what happens after wine and not really a sport after all and aren't you glad you never read that post...) and delight you with...
Nancy Reagan fell at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California only to be caught by Marco Rubio. She said she was grateful for the swift and decisive action of that waiter.
Another way is to contact the host and see if they will take the website offline under threats of a lawsuit (though the wrongdoer would still retain the domain name until you wrestle it from them since the host company and domain name registrar are two different entities). This has limited success, especially when the website is hosted overseas. When dealing with a cyber squatter, it is important to consider that they could have their website hosted overseas making it virtually untouchable (if they haven’t already). Thus, if your target is currently hosting within the United States, you may only have one shot at them until they wise up and transfer their website hosting overseas, so it is important to make that one shot count.

So there I was, late last Wednesday evening, bashing out a post about wee Johnny Rotten's crappy adverts. By 9am the following morning I've had 100+ hits and 7 comments... great I thinks, until I read em... Looks like my post may have hit a raw nerve with a die hard JR fan, refusing to believe their hero could possibly sell out. Whoever it was, they had taken umbrage with Start The Revolution Without Me! and the word must have been out on some forum to bombard me with comments (there was also some jiggery-pokery going on, that meant the website that the link was coming from was masked in my stats information). I mean, it's not that the comments were rude or anything like that, they were just rubbish! Random rubbish! Then I spots that some of my older posts have had random rubbish added to their comments too!
Unschooling does not bestow climbing ability on unschooled kids. Genes determine how much monkey climbing ability we get. The conventional parenting rule to Keep Them Safe erects a "No" cage based on Mom's fears rather than the child's ability. A "No" cage prevent kids -- and Moms -- from discovering what they are capable of today (which may be different from last week.)
Senior Commissioning Editor, Jasmine Richards explains why Witchfinder: Dawn of the Demontide excited her when it was submitted to Oxford University Press:
In my own experience, I can see how I have opened many a door to allow discouragement to come in. Not because of what the Lord has placed on me. But because I was a step ahead of him. Or carrying too much of my own expectations into a situation.
And after reading this, I said, "Oh yeah? We'll see about that." So over my summer vacation, I picked up The Chronicles of Narnia. And I liked them. Until I got to the ending, and was like, "What the heck!?!?!?!? I thought these were supposed to be children's books????? Are you serious???? Seriously????"
It's possible to devote an hour to the cathedral and another to the castle. I decided on a time limit for both based on how much loose change I had for the parking ticket machine and besides, I wanted to do lunch in Hull.
So is this a sad story or a happy one? I can't decide. One hundred sales, including friends and people who were curious to see what a launch party was like and may never actually finish the book is a negligible readership. On the other hand, without the ability to self-publish, the book would have gone into the drawer and probably never come out.
So, here I was, all 5'2" exploring the Bronx with nothing but a pair of flip flops and a few case files. Don let me know he'd be running late, (blast the MTA and their unlimited metrocard inflations!) so I decided that, rather than risk it, I'd open this puppy up before the clock struck eight. After wrongly wandering into the actual post office across the street, looking ever regal in its always pip-pip-cheerio-fashion, the attendant kindly pointed me across the street to a glowing neon red sign reading "Postnet". Well, that makes sense.

A few days prior to surgery, I received a call reminding me of my appointment. She confirmed my arrival time of 7:15 and surgery time of 8:30. She then reminded me to wear absolutely no perfume or anything with a strong, heavy scent as it interferes with the laser.

I happened to be on Cannery Row this weekend for a few minutes. Immortalized by John Steinbeck and now completely gutted of all history and sense of time and place, the conglomeration of "art galleries" (the Thomas Kinkade National Archives, and no, I am NOT making this up, is just a few blocks away), t-shirt boutiques and ice cream vendors are all that stand for what once was.

But in the traditional PR firm structure, account and creative responsibilities are combined in one job. One minute you’re brainstorming tactics and the next you’re managing spreadsheets. You go from writing a speech to soothing a client’s nerves.
So, here's what's up for elimination.
A PROCLAMATION
Even actors have to work hard to stay in the limelight. For every instantly recognisable movie star, there must be twenty with vaguely familiar faces whose names are never mentioned in the gossip sheets. Many who were once household names later vanish without trace. I often wonder what happened to Charlene Tilton, the pint-sized blonde who played Lucy Ewing in Dallas. I’ll never forget the way her character responded to J.R. when he tried to bait her at the breakfast table:
After more than a year of litigation, U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman didn’t need a trial to convince him to rule in favor of the utility. He said the Environmental Protection Agency went to court too soon and needs to collect more data to determine whether improvements at Monroe Unit 2 have caused an increase in emissions.
The best thing about Tuesday was listening to the many interviews with Maurice Sendak--what an interesting man! And I am very thankful for his quirky look at life shared in such an enjoyable manner!
2. In a microwave safe bowl (I used Pyrex), add in glutinous, sugar and water, mix well with a spoon. Microwave for 2 minutes. Take it out and give it a stir. Microwave for 30 seconds. Take it out and give it another stir. Microwave for a further 30 seconds or until the batter is cooked through.

Announce your award in the most prominent place possible on the home page of your organization’s Web site. Also add it to your biography as well as the News section. Then insert a photograph or two — RESOLVE will provide photographs of the winner with Executive Director Barbara Collura – and voila, you’ve made a simple but significant splash in publicizing this honor.

‘My name’s Rook. You all know me. You know I know the difference between shit and shinola. And this man here,’ she pointed a long finger at The Prophet. ‘This so-called Prophet is talking some of that old-fashioned bullshit.’
We first learned of the amazingness that is the Shark mop from my parents. They have hardwood floors all throughout the majority of the lower level of their house. After years of being loyal Swiffer mop users, they picked up a Shark mop recently at Costco and fell in love. Upon hearing their praises of the product and seeing the results, we immediately added one to our registry. Two shedding cats + a condo with hardwood floors throughout = lots of floor cleaning around these parts.
Interestingly enough, Abu Hamza is part of this story too; along with Finsbury mosque. It is said that he mastered minded the terrorist attacks in Yemen as well as the abduction of tourists. He denied this. However, one of the British terrorists was no other than his son and one of the others was his godson! Being a good father, he admitted telephoning them just after they had abducted the tourists in Yemen.

I advised him that this was not going to be a happy reunion. That I was going to tell him how I feel and why I feel the way I do and he can take it as it is. I will be meeting him this Sunday for a coffee and a chat and I have a feeling I’ll be walking away from the convo before it ever ends.
Nora Marlowe’s final role was as Mrs.Flossie Brimmer on “The Waltons” (1972-77). She was Sara Andrews on “The Governor And J.J” (1969-70).

Radcliffe, who I suspect has by this time quite settled into his performance, was better by far than the critics led audiences to believe. Although, as the New York Times suggested he is not a natural "song and dance man" (I am not quite sure what that means, and when I think of such figures I can only conjure up Robert Preston and Robert Morse, the original J. Pierrepont Finch, neither of them great singers or even able dancers!), he can now belt out a tuneful song and, with the help of the able chorus, jump, leap, and hoof it across the stage quite ably. Once and a while you can still see him grimace a bit, as if muttering deep within, "I'm gonna be great!" And, at moments, he is! If nothing else you have to recognize that Radcliffe is giving his all, which unfortunately, if you have seen Robert Morse in the role—I saw only the movie version, but listened to the original cast recording so many hundreds of times in my youth that the old wax stereo recording is all scratches and scapes—is just not enough.
By slow roasting the veggies, this soup has an incredible richness and depth of flavor. Though I chose to top it with a bit of shaved Parmesan cheese, this soup is otherwise completely vegan...and completely fabulous. Though sugar wasn't in the original recipe (adapted from here), I added a pinch because my tomatoes were a bit on the acidic side. It was enough to take the edge off. I also added additional salt, because I used low sodium vegetable stock.
Gomer, a prostitute of that time, left her husband and her children abandoning all responsibility of what one would call a wife. She went into the street and sold herself to the lowest bidder and in some cases she even gave herself away. She became everybody’s woman. Her husband loved her so much, that he was willing to pay everything he had to buy her back. He was a true valentines day gift. His Valentines day came more than February 14th, he went and got her more than once. You know it is hard for a man to part with his money.
The truth must be told!

If we can’t love our spouses, how can we uphold Jesus’ calling to love the unlovable and our enemies?
I think for the most part, writers write because that’s what they do. When I hear this question I think of the writers of the past who had other jobs or duties to attend to but found tiny amounts of time in their busy days to devote to writing. Most people weren’t as lucky as William Shakespeare who was a play writer, he was able to directly make money off of his writing. People like Emily Dickinson wrote because she could. She was rich, so she really had no obligation to write for monetary value. If she wrote because she was bored, why didn’t she paint or draw?
I’ve never felt this way before, where everything just goes away when his arms are wrapped around me, I feel so close to him, and safe, and comfortable. When we sleep through the night he is my pillow and holds me close, and I awake still in his arms, it is heaven.

Apple (Nasdaq:AAPL) has an $81 Billion cash hoard. This amounts to 25% of its market cap. The stock does not pay a dividend. Everyone clearly agrees that they have enough for a robust R&D effort. This ensures that they can beat up any direct competitor and/or buy up smart ideas while they are still small.
Which brings me back to Bridge of Terabithia. It is number eight on the ALA’s 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books List, 1990 – 1999, and has been challenged for occult, as mentioned above, and for offensive language. It has also been deemed age inapproate due to portraying a death. The way the death is written by Paterson, which is carefully and beautifully crafted, I personally feel would help tweens and teens alike deal with the reality of and often frightening emotions accompanying the death of a loved one. Over the course of the book, one of the main characters is able to come to terms with his own feelings of anger and frustration, which is far from easy even for adults, and by the end of the book is able to accept what has happened and begin anew with grace. Isn’t this the type of discussion, as parents, we would want to be a part of with our kids? To learn from them and to better understand life from their point of view? And in this, creating a cornerstone of trust and respect that may help them over life’s next hurdle? In banning a book, even in our own homes, are we removing a possible opportunity for a two-way discussion? What are we, as parents, afraid of?
Mark 9:28-29, “And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why could we not cast it out?” (29) And he said to them, “This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer.”"

If the entity in question is “simply” a projection or reflection of the channeler’s own mind, that is not necessarily a bad thing at all, though I think it would be far preferable for the person to realize what is going on and not to become too dependent on what appears to be a separate mentality. Receiving wisdom from our own higher or greater selves is perfectly valid, and indeed that must be what happens when great art is created and when great scientific or other discoveries make themselves known.

The percentage of teenagers who have jobs, expressed as the ratio of employment to population, hovered between 40 and 50 percent for much of the 1980s and 1990s. The percentage began dropping about a decade ago, but the declines have been especially steep since the beginning of the Great Recession in late 2007.

What does the SST data show? The 5 year moving SST temperature average shows that the warming trend peaked in 2003 and a simple regression analysis shows an eight year global SST cooling trend since then .The data shows warming from 1900 - 1940 ,cooling from 1940 to about 1975 and warming from 1975 – 2003. CO2 levels rose monotonically during this entire period.There has been no net warming since 1997 - 15 years with CO2 up 7.9% and no net warming. Anthropogenic CO2 has some effect but our knowledge of the natural drivers is still so poor that we cannot accurately estimate what the anthropogenic CO2 contribution is. Since 2003 CO2 has risen further and yet the global temperature trend is negative. This is obviously a short term on which to base predictions but all statistical analyses of particular time series must be interpreted in conjunction with other ongoing events and in the context of declining solar magnetic field strength and activity – to the extent of a possible Dalton or Maunder minimum and the negative phase of the Pacific Decadal a global 20 – 30 year cooling spell is more likely than a warming trend.
To get to a trillion dollars, Apple’s shares would have to hit $1,073.
The point being, that once we start really thinking about it, the separation between mind and body is fuzzy at best. Most of what we think of as independent conscious thought has been driven by subconscious desires, habituated thought patterns and bodily functions. If you doubt this, see how long you avoid going to the toilet before it occupies your conscious thoughts so completely, you are utterly unable to think of anything else.
