Miami back Lamar Miller's 54-yard run on the Hurricanes' first offensive play illustrated the problem. The Miami offensive line blew open a hole, linebackers Storm Klein and Andrew Sweat couldn't get off their blocks, and then linebacker Etienne Sabino and safeties Orhian Johnson and C.J. Barnett all whiffed on Miller, basically taking one another out of the play in a three-way, missed-tackle collision. Both Simon and Sweat have talked about a miscommunication on the play, with Simon indicating some part of the defense didn't hear an adjustment. But Haynes didn't buy that.

In this as in so much else, the history of New Orleans is steeped in irony, paradox and confusion. As Powell writes about a canal that was planned but never dug in 1719, But this was how things went in New Orleans before New Orleans officially became New Orleans, and long afterward, too: solutions to foreseeable problems usually surfaced as afterthoughts. The improvisational style was characteristic of many frontier communities. Early New Orleans raised it to an organizational principle.

A: I'm not a veteran that lives in San Diego, but you can associate me with the veterans that live in San Diego. I believe that the awards that our young men and women receive for the service that they perform for their country are badges of honor. And it's not just a medal that may be given for heroism or valor. Young men and women come into the Navy and they do things that are pretty extraordinary. And they serve in places and they go do things and they separate themselves from their families and they make sacrifices in their personal and sometimes in their professional lives. And what our young men and women have as a story that tells that is what they wear on their chest. And I think that that is something that should be displayed and treasured as a matter of honor. And I feel that way about it. And if I'm in a different place than the judge, I am. But I really do believe that what we wear on our chest talks about what we did for our country.

Given the uprisings in the Arab world this year that have toppled authoritarian rulers from Tunisia to Egypt to Libya, it's tempting to speculate whether the Iraqi people might have overthrown Saddam Hussein on their own, without involving any American forces. Such questions can never be answered, of course, and the outcome of those revolutions is still far from certain. But it's indisputable that today's Middle East is a vastly different place from what it was at the time of the 2003 invasion. Whether it is better or worse, history will have to judge. For now, we can only rejoice in the safe return of our troops this Christmas season and offer our prayers for a brighter future for the people of Iraq.

In 2010, the Gap clothing chain felt no other option than to revert to its decades-old logo after those who despised the new one took to Facebook, Twitter and blogs to complain. SOPA, the Stop Online Piracy Act, was recently torpedoed by social media outcry, and the Obama administration's much-criticized decision to require Catholic universities and charities to offer women birth control free of charge got an official White House backpedaling.
The consequences are evident on Clement Street, where one of Burdick's next-door neighbors pays only half his gross property tax bill thanks to the credit.

• Season grade: Washington State -- Ted Miller, ESPN.com: A 4-8 finish that gets coach Paul Wulff fired isn't going to get a high grade. But the Cougs took a significant step forward in 2011, and that bodes well for another step forward under first-year coach Mike Leach. A team that three years ago looked -- and played -- like a mid-level FCS team was highly competitive in 2011, recording its only quality conference win -- against Arizona State -- during the Wulff Era. The Cougars were still outmanned against most Pac-12 foes, but they fought back all season. The fact is, the general mood in Pullman at present is as high as it has been in years, perhaps since Mike Price was on the sidelines.

As Pryor stepped away from his postgame interview Saturday, I asked him if he could run after the injury, and he said, "No." Taking his run threat away completely changes how defenses have to defend the Buckeyes. That's the concern. If Pryor getting outside isn't a worry, then defenses can better defend the pass and the running game with the tailbacks.

If the Washington Capitals' meeting with the Philadelphia Flyers on Tuesday night truly represented a measuring stick of their progress under coach Dale Hunter, as players billed it in the hours leading up to the game, then they came up far short.

"At this point, there's no reason to think about it. It's not going to help me. It's not going to help (the team). I'm still confident they're going to be just fine. I'm sure they're going to have their own plan going into the race. There's going to be big accidents, and it's going to be just a matter of staying away from them. I'm sure as long as they get past the start and the restarts, it's going to be a matter of keeping your distance. I have a feeling they'll be just fine.

Another young wife told me how she has watched her mother-in-law live faithfully and have integrity over time, not just in her marriage, but in all her relationships. This young wife has, she shared, watched her husband's mother face real adversity. But she does it so well and so humbly that she is an example of a wise woman my young friend wants to emulate. And, she said, she and her mother-in-law are able to be very intimate and have open conversations without my young friend ever feeling judged.

As I ponder the most beautiful places I've visited in America, my head fills with visions of the rocky Maine coast in summer, when long days ease into evenings of buttery soft-shelled lobster and chilled white wine.

Kevin Walsh of the Fair Share Housing Center said it reduces the state’s affordable housing obligation from 116,000 units to 50,000.

Mr. Romney has his unscripted, inspired moments. Late in South Carolina, a feisty Mr. Romney chastised a heckler—who was slamming him for being the 1%—for seeking to "divide the nation . . . as our President is doing," and then riffed on America's great economic model. Romney strategist Eric Fehrnstrom boasted it was "Mitt Romney at his best." He was right. And it lasted all of 30 seconds.

Lee Fisher, talking with voters on the stump and in commercials about his "better" plan to bring back jobs. He knew that voters worried about federal spending, but that wasn't the real issue, according to Jeff Sadosky, Portman's communications director. It was just a "tangible symptom of a bigger government."

I do fully agree with you, Katherine, that too much is made out of politicians' parenting abilities, especially women's. I do hold out one exception, though -- politicians who support intrusive government action on our home lives should be held to the very standards they'd impose by law on the rest of us. If the words "sanctity of life" or "sanctity of marriage" ever pass between your lips, I consider that an open invitation for the citizenry to file through your underwear drawer and follow you into any airport bathroom to witness any foot-tapping antics.
In layman's terms, the stock structure change will double the shares existing stockholders have, while likely halving the cost of Google stock. Current shareholders of Google will retain their voting power in the company while gaining shares, but future investors -- including employees who receive stock as part of their pay -- will not have a say in the company's future.
Kovalchuk saw a tired unit of Flyers head to the bench while the puck was still dangerously close to their end. He also saw Ponikarovsky coming onto the ice, and he hit him with a long pass into the Philadelphia end. Ponikarovsky skated in on Bryzgalov, and let go a shot that was stopped by the goalie. But the rebound came right back to him, and Ponikarovsky deftly switched to his backhand and put the puck in the net to end the game with his first career playoff overtime goal.

Mountain homes in older communities that were built before the 2000s have seen relatively modest price decreases, but homes and land being sold in neighborhoods started in the early and mid-2000s have seen prices go down by as much as 50%, he says.

"A lot of public companies become ‘ghost ships.' I mean a lot of companies get to a point where they no longer have a really interested party on the board, and when you have a board of directors that's not made up of people who own a lot of stock or have a lot at stake. The problem is that they make decisions too slowly, and they aren't able to make really, really hard decisions."

CLEVELAND -- The Browns missed a chance to draft one Baylor star but they might have a crack at another.
The move was as necessary – and predictable – as it will be costly to Angels owner Arte Moreno who has made a frequent habit out of paying players not to play for him. Scott Kazmir ($9.5 million) and Justin Speier ($6.5 million) were both released with millions still owed on their contracts in the past two years. Gary Matthews Jr. was traded away with the majority of his contract ($21 million) remaining on the Angels' ledger.
The greater diversity among politicians also reflects more tolerance on the part of American voters, at least toward some sects.

“The Newlyweds” is ultimately less romantic than its title. George and Amina soon realize, as any couple must, that they don’t know as much about each other as they once believed.

One point worth noting was that the four other players suspended for five games along with Pryor -- left tackle Mike Adams, receiver DeVier Posey, running back Dan Herron and defensive end Solomon Thomas -- were in their usual spots at practice. Adams, Posey and Herron were with the first team and Thomas with the second team. There are a lot of other questions, though, for a team that lost seven starters on defense and three on offense.

Maybe there's more to blame than human folly and hubris. Maybe we can fault freak atmospheric conditions that caused a mirage or an even rarer astronomical event that sent icebergs into shipping lanes.

Here's how it's supposed to work this time: The Fed buys Treasury bonds from banks, providing them cash to lend to customers. Buying so many bonds also lowers interest rates because demand for Treasurys leads to higher prices and lower yields. Interest rates are linked to yields. Lower rates encourage people to borrow money for a mortgage or another loan.

I just opened the notice from the City of Pacifica regarding a proposed sewer increase. A rate hearing is scheduled for May 14 at 7 p.m. at 2212 Beach Blvd. Like most people, I have a very busy life so most of the time I simply ignore those notices or throw them out. This time I actually read it. I found one sentence particularly interesting: "If written protests against the proposed charges are presented by a majority of owners of parcels subject to the charges, the City Council will not impose the proposed charges." The chances of that happening are slim to none. Most people will not read the notice and if they do, will not take the time to write a letter. It would be better if they would simply go along with the desire of the majority of parcel owners who actually show up at the May 14 Public Hearing. But the way the system is set up pretty much guarantees the rate increase. I just wanted to alert those who read the Tribune that we do have a voice in this matter. I am not advocating for or against the rate increase, but simply that we do have a choice.

øAll told, Russia looks likely to go 1-for-20 in successful Mars missions with the failure of Phobos-Grunt, a blow to a space program that analyst Bertrand de Montluc of France's Centre for the Study of International Relations called "resurgent" in a 2010 Space Policy journal report. But he also noted then that funding for the Russian space agency, averaging about $950 million a year, looked "weak." Now that weakness seems to have caught up to ROSCOSMOS.

That's one real-world takeaway from my brush with altitude. Another is that physically speaking, I'm probably a good candidate for higher climbing. A third is that I'm fascinated by this subject, and still curious, enough to meet up with Glickman later to try a machine that simulates elevations up to 25,000 feet, comparable to peaks in the Himalayas.

His job may appear easy, but that’s because the freshman Craft is making it that way. He isn’t technically a starter, but Craft has managed to become one of the most important pieces to the Buckeyes’ title run this spring.

It was not always so. At the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Obama voiced the then-popular belief among the left that President George W. Bush's decision to target Saddam Hussein in Iraq had presented a distraction that robbed America of a quick and sure turnabout in the Afghanistan theater. "I will end this war in Iraq responsibly," Obama declared, "and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan."

"Justices are elected to eight-year terms, so a justice who turns 70 shortly after being elected can serve until she is well into her 70s," observes Kelly, who will be 74 -- and thus precluded from seeking a re-election -- when her current term expires this December.
Urethral stents have been devised and tried. Most urologists have abandoned their use. Minerals in the urine often deposit on the stent and eventually block it. Secondly, in the urethra, scar tissue adds to stent obstruction. And finally, it is technically difficult to remove a urethral stent.

"The lawsuit is like an umbrella over everything," Councilwoman Wendy Leece said.

Mr. Sarkozy and the European Commission in Brussels had other ideas. At 2:45 p.m. the next day, Sunday, May 9, the 27 commissioners signed off on a draft pact.

But the masterpiece here was "Barstow," a sort of song cycle based on pieces of graffiti left by hitchhikers in the middle of the Californian nowhere.

The sashimi -- salmon, tuna, yellowtail, or a combo -- have fresh, delicate flavors. But the rolls can feel redundant. A spicy dynamite roll fails to explode. The Special Hiro roll isn't.

Even with this antique cathedral, Friedman is trying to throw off the dead hand of the past. "We changed everything," he says, and as we stroll through the company's newest store—actually, a design gallery, in the sense that some antiques aren't yet for sale—the company's shift slowly reveals itself. That interesting mirror on the wall? Friedman and his team found a pair of brackets leaning against a wall in Antwerp, originally ceiling supports for an old theater in Paris. On the flight home, Friedman began sketching. What if you inverted the brackets, put them together, and added a mirror? "Wouldn't that be spectacular?" Friedman says. "A mirror like you've never seen." The mirror—"19th C Parisian architectural bracket mirror"—will appear in the company's fall collection.
"You think, 'Well, here is a group of men, roughly the same age, going through a similar experience in the same place - they must be alike,' " Lee said. "But it's more complicated than that. We set out to put a face to the war, but we ended up putting a few faces to it."

You think that Ben Howland would’ve liked to have seen this kid finish out his career at UCLA? After playing his freshman season in Westwood, Moser decided to transfer and ended up in Las Vegas — and are head coach Dave Rice and company thankful for that? In last Saturday’s big win over No. 13 San Diego State, Moser was the Runnin’ Rebels’ leading scorer with 19 points. He’s scored in double digits in 12 of his past 14 games and has a total of 13 double-doubles on the season. Moser’s emergence is a big reason why UNLV is having another revival season this year.

Jacquie Kaner weighs 125 pounds, is as strong as an ox and a major gym rat. She is our navigator and loves to study maps and routes. She always knew where we were. Blanch Kosche is around 130 pounds and trains by walking to the store and carrying her groceries home in her backpack. She cracked two ribs a month before our trip, which meant she couldn't breathe deeply for a while. But she just kept walking. Blanch is our domestic. She had a plastic bag, a string or a bungee cord for every possible occasion. She even carried a miniature wire whisk to whip up her dried milk.

Clothes moths are occasionally found in closets, where they lay their eggs on suitable fabric. The larvae hatch and feed on the fabric.

How do you Hulu? You don't have to pay anything, download a special player or even register your name or e-mail address. The site, which went up in mid-March, is free; in exchange for watching relatively brief ads, you get access to complete high-resolution episodes of top TV series such as "24" and "30 Rock," as well as impressively cataloged clips from "Saturday Night Live" and other shows. (The movie roster is somewhat less formidable, unless you consider "The Payaso Comedy Slam" or "Snake Eater" the apex of cinematic art.)

"Do we really need a remake of something like 'War of the Worlds'?

We can certainly improve on the original film technology, but why bother?"
