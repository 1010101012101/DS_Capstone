What did my father do 7 years ago when I reached puberty? He sat me down and told me the facts and how it all happens. Every time I leave the house he jokingly says he will draw blood when I return and have me tested. He jokes, but it has sunk in so deep now, I think about the consequences every time I see a gorgeous girl.
Not that there is any desire to discredit Mr. Walter E. Parfitt or Cornelius Ferguson Jr. There veracity is above proof, or rather it is independent of proof and can stand alone and unchallenged.
It made him whistle, it made him sing;
The film shows how since 1980 the price of processed food (produced by corporate agriculture – chips, snacks, cookies, etc.) has gone down, while fruits and vegetables have gone up 40% in price – a leading cause of obesity because the working poor can no longer afford healthy food, they have to buy what they can and make it last as long as possible, so of course you’re going to shop cheap!
I like Damon’s music and I love Noel’s. This would be a fine collaboration, if you ask me. I think Noel’s right that it would be “mental.”
A+ collaborations coupled with instrumentals and a few older joints is what you will find en masse on this brutally good mix, that encases a game aggressiveness that so much of today's Hip-hop is missing. If you like your lyrics raw and your beats airy and hardcore, check in Stu Bangas and Vanderslice have released a tape custom made for you...

Beyan goes to chat aside with her sister and suddenly, you saw the high school girl. She’s 24, cute and nice, and her conversation with her sister (who was too afraid to comment) was all about how she could do what she wants now that she is an adult and that she is in love and then “I’m Every Woman” started playing on the radio and her sister smashes the boombox because their Dad “might hear”. I mean, when Kacie said her sister knows her way better than her parents lets you know they have been acting like prohibition rum runners hiding shit from them. That said, maybe it means she’s dangerous in bed? I’m sorry hometowns aren’t about families, they are about who is locked into a mandatory sex vacation with Ben the next week. That’s the name of the game.
It is the historic April 15th deadline of the S.S.P.X to make an "agreement" with Modernist Rome. Restoration Radio will joined by a former S.S.P.X priest, Fr. Anthony Cekada, to talk about similarities of this situation to 1984, 1988, 2000, and 2007 within the S.S.P.X. We had hoped to get an S.S.P.X priest on-board for another viewpoint, but were unfortunately unable to do so.
This is definitely an advanced course for practitioners. As an educated non-practitioner, I was impressed with Dr. Fratkin’s teaching style. It was organized, entertaining and quickly zeroed in on the critical issues as they were raised by the practitioners in attendance.
Best wishes for the joyous festive season and peaceful times of deserved rest. May the new year bring newly found happiness, prosperity, and scientific integrity.

I sleep lighter than a feather. Anything stirs me from my slumber; Younger Dad breathing, Younger Dad snoring, Younger Dad trumping, mice getting high on crumbs in the kitchen and any nocturnal squeal from Little A. I also have this habit of waking up just before Little A cries out in the dark. It must be that psychic mummy baby connection thing.

Ah, then the Manpower start to repair the previous breakdown, started to tighten the PR intake. He even go into tightening the Global Investor Program from $30m to $50M. There is also upping the base salary for S pass holders. However, still it looks like the upping is not a deterrent, it look more like it is shifting a little higher than inflation rate. But though the repairing of manpower, this guy that had created this mathematic is not repairing the previous health guy had done. Just changing some numbers.

It’s hard to believe that it has been that long since I held her in my arms, completely in awe of her tiny-ness. And even more in awe of the fact that I had a daughter! A “psychic” had told her father that I was carrying a boy. I didn’t have a strong feeling one way or another as I had with my son, so when the doctor said, “It’s a girl!” I was glad I was in bed or I would have passed out!
I'm not going to measure my success on how others think of me. The success in my life is reflected by how my family views me. Just like the article above states, my children love me, and they don't care how good I am at braiding hair or baking cakes! They think the world of me. They are smart and they are learning so much every day. That's how I measure my success, teaching them the things they need to know, and loving them. However, they're teaching me more than I'm teaching them!!

ii) Animals- I love animals, so why not combine a career with them? I could become a circus performer? Or a lion tamers? Or even a vet? I know that to become a vet you need to study for years and years, but the end result is that you get to see a lot of dogs every day, and that’s a happy thought, no? Only downside I can see is that as a vet, I would be required to put animals down, and I can’t really be doing that. It wouldn’t make a very good impression on the owners if I was striking their pets on the chest whilst doing CPR and screaming, “You’ve never given up on anything in your life! Now live!” Especially if they had only just brought their tortoise in for a check up.

Wrapping up my old job and preparing to start this new one are what's kept me from posting (and commenting) as much as I'd like to lately and I imagine this adventure might keep me away from the blogs altogether for a while. At least until I get used to my schedule and figure out if blogging still fits into it. I have a couple of half-written posts about a recent "field trip" that I hope to get up soon and, at some point, I'll update you on how the job's shaping up. In the meantime, have a great week and wish me luck!

But no, because what I'm going back to is relentless, 100+ degree heat and an historical drought. Green things burned up and ready to ignite with the smallest flame. A house I'm tired of living in that needs new carpet, paint. Air conditioning. TV. The ridiculous amount of email and other stuff I'm going to be faced with when I walk back in to work.

Many powerful voices have already spoken against these practices but I felt compelled to add my own because watching this film I felt a sense of responsibility to shed the light and share the pain on how some womenfolk suffer in the name of religion or marriage. They suffer to death trapped in marriages that bring them grief every day of their lives. How I wish our society could release them from this bondage.

Still, The Last Ringbearer has its own kind of appeal. I found that the more I approached it on its own terms, rather than constantly comparing it to Tolkien’s infinitely richer and more complex vision, there was enough there to justify the time and effort. Minor, yes, but not entirely uninteresting.

One compensation is—It really is, even in its ghostly white, a beautiful design. I think I could wear a rag, and drape this shawl over it, and no one would notice anything besides the shawl. It will be a stunning part of my outfit. I won't put it on till after the ceremony—I have no desire to steal the attention from my DD (who has picked out really beautiful dress, and will easily be the star attraction) but I suspect the mother of groom will be a bit put out.

When you pin your handles to your gathered exterior, make sure the acute angles are toward the center of your exterior piece. Also make sure that your pinched edge is facing up. That will ensure that the sewn edge is facing IN. The sketch in the pattern is perfect. It only shows one side rather than both like above, but it is enough to walk you through it.

Let’s be honest: Agents and editors like to make you quiver and sweat as you approach Chapter One. All those warnings: “Grab me from the opening sentence! Don’t waste one word! If my attention flags, you’ve failed—you’re down the toilet! In fact, don’t even write Chapter One! Start your book at Chapter Four! Leave out all that David Copperfield crap!” From their perspective it’s an acid test. They know how important Chapter One is, and if you’re weak, they’ll scare you into giving up before you begin. (Hey, it makes their jobs easier: one less query in the queue.)

While this is a very brief summary simplifying enormouse tasks, it is a guideline to map out the plan of action in advance. Of course, keep in mind that things don't always work out how you planned and that is OK to. So if you happen to fall in love with a florist that you met while booking your venue, go ahead and book him/her. Be flexible! Just make sure that you don't make any decisions under pressure. Always give yourself a night to think, process, and compare before signing contracts and handing over that check.
All matter consists of atoms. Using the same procedure explained in the above paragraph, in order for the element carbon to be formed by this process, the chances would be 10 to the 325th power which is an insurmountable number of chances. Take a sheet of paper and put a 10 down followed by 325 zeros. Science cannot justify this “per chance” arrangement nor can I. It would have to be tweaked by some power other than “per chance”. Could this power possibly be our creator, God? Just something to think about.
In the case of refugees, they are generally single mass movements that force a block of people to move as one: the impetus is generally fear and poverty. However, in most of the scenarios postulated, there is no great impetus of fear. Conditions are bad, but there is no difference between the area that people are in and some other place. If there was an increase in violent racism as an example, than certain groups might indeed pick up and move. But they are likely to be individual groups with a common purpose, not the ad hoc hordes generally described. link (hit the pdf button in middle of box)

We've got 2 pound heirloom tomatoes and loads of little yellow pear tomatoes that shine like jewels in the sun. The spaghetti squash contracted a bad case of powdery mildew but somehow, she's still going strong, sending out more runners and flowers ahead of the mildew. The soup beans are drying on the porch already and the melons are getting fat and juicy. I have nice meal planned for the kale with some sweet potatoes and ricotta, and the fordhook chard is finally overcoming its late start. I actually made beet cake a few weeks ago. Not half bad, really.

This means you have to fight for your strategic time, as it’s the process that takes an unfocused business and sets it firmly on the track to success. Setting strategy requires blocking time on your calendar to focus attention on soliciting feedback from others on how to make litigation support and delivery of its services better. It also requires sitting down with management to understand the larger picture, how and where litigation support fits into that picture. That takes time, attention, good listening, and focus on how best to use that information to find consensus and to make improvements that count.

During the final battle for Excalibur, Morgaine attempted to threaten Ace and Shou Yuing with the Destroyer, claiming they would become his handmaidens. Though he wanted to break through the chalk barrier, Morgaine didn't want to release him, allowing him access to his full powers. Despite this weakness, he was still able to destroy the hotel, allowing Morgaine to escape with the sword and then teleporting away. The Destroyer let the Doctor and the Brigadier follow them, since Morgaine would need to release him. When the Doctor gained the upper hand, Morgaine was forced to unchain the Destroyer and escaped.

The interferon is still kicking his butt. He just got up to full dose and in the first full dose, he had a site reaction and it's all red. The second full dose bled heavily and when he gives the injections in his legs, he gets really weak legged. Stuff to talk to the doctor about at his next appointment. My mom says he is actually walking more stable when he isn't using his cane and that is an improvement I don't see. Maybe I'm too close to notice it.

Freedom is a wonderful thing, and a precious commodity in the design world. Without freedom, we go insane, bending to the will of others. Freedom invites innovation to the table. There is a common misconception that designers have full creative liberty, when in fact we are merely vessels than translate ideas/notions into life, and to do this, we must be able to predict what our client, the user, or the consumer; wants. More often than not, before they even know it themselves. I give the Ipod as a classic, albeit well-used, example. Apple did not identify a gap in the market and fill it… they created the market, and therefore the demand. But for the men and women who designed it, Apple was the client. Apple had a brief for a product and its parameters that needed to be fulfilled.
Imagine: a small, fairly non-descript Belgian market town – altho’ its actually a city (being proclaimed such in 1068).
It adds no small weight to all these considerations, to recollect that history informs us of no long-lived republic which had not a senate. Sparta, Rome, and Carthage are, in fact, the only states to whom that character can be applied. In each of the two first there was a senate for life. The constitution of the senate in the last is less known. Circumstantial evidence makes it probable that it was not different in this particular from the two others. It is at least certain, that it had some quality or other which rendered it an anchor against popular fluctuations; and that a smaller council, drawn out of the senate, was appointed not only for life, but filled up vacancies itself. These examples, though as unfit for the imitation, as they are repugnant to the genius, of America, are, notwithstanding, when compared with the fugitive and turbulent existence of other ancient republics, very instructive proofs of the necessity of some institution that will blend stability with liberty. I am not unaware of the circumstances which distinguish the American from other popular governments, as well ancient as modern; and which render extreme circumspection necessary, in reasoning from the one case to the other. But after allowing due weight to this consideration, it may still be maintained, that there are many points of similitude which render these examples not unworthy of our attention. Many of the defects, as we have seen, which can only be supplied by a senatorial institution, are common to a numerous assembly frequently elected by the people, and to the people themselves. There are others peculiar to the former, which require the control of such an institution. The people can never willfully betray their own interests; but they may possibly be betrayed by the representatives of the people; and the danger will be evidently greater where the whole legislative trust is lodged in the hands of one body of men, than where the concurrence of separate and dissimilar bodies is required in every public act.”
The scrapbook I put on earlier was received well and I easily spent my earnings. It does seem so wrong to be paid for something that you had such fun doing - it kept me quiet for hours, made me routle around bits of my stash that have not seen the light of day for a while as well as introduce me in to a new way of crafting. Sometimes we all need a push to try something different and a I am so pleased I did - I even went on more of the scrapbook stands than usual.

The art work in this book by Kathleen Rietz is extremely well executed. Each of the frames, which cover two pages each, are done in mellow and soothing colors. Each illustration fits the text perfectly. The artist has captured the mood of each picture perfectly on the face of the dog without overly anthropomorphizing her subject...I like this...it adds much to the overall message of the book. This is a very skillful writer and skillful artist that have teamed up here!

But this book is much more than just about the horrors of war. In many senses, this book is devoted to reintroducing characters and showing them in new lights. For example, Severian's old nemesis, Agia, has grown in her time away from Severian. Where earlier she seemed to be devoted solely to her hatred of Severian, her actions and eventual escape from the climatic scene with the wounded Autarch puts her in a Vodalus-like opposition to Severian. It is no longer just a simple personal affair but rather that her opposition has come to symbolize a sort of selfish, "anti-life" rebellion similar to that of Vodalus's against the Autarch, which Wolfe makes explicitly clear in a passage near the end of the book.

Wallace fountains, named after the English industrialist who financed their original design and construction in the late 19th century, are elegant cast-iron structures that have a continuous stream of water running in the space behind those lovely ladies holding up the canopy. Apparently, these originally had a metal cup on a chain for passersby to catch a drink but for hygiene reasons, these are long gone. There's no way to stick your head in but plenty of room for your water bottle. There are over 60 of these fountains spread around Paris and they are turned on from March through November.

We cannot see how life really is unless we are able to see how we project our psychology onto life. Operating from the perspective of projection, we are ceaselessly reactive. Our sensed world is divided up into discrete categories of what serves our purpose (a very small percentage of what is actually sensed) and what does not serve our purpose (everything else). When we are dominated by projection, we are not open to authentic life. Instead, life is only what we experience through the filter of a Fear-Self.

the first time Fulci, used paedophilia to provoke, it plays a vital part in the narrative of Beatrice Cenci 1969 too, where both Tomas Milian and Georges Wilson are part of the cast. Fulci, no stranger to getting in trouble with the law – i.e. the puppet dog incident following Una Lucertola con la pelle di donna (Lizard in a Woman’s Skin) 1971 – once again ended up facing another trial when the scene where the naked Bouchet takes to seducing Michele caused a stir. Always the one with an ace up his sleeve, Fulci presented the "little person" Don Semeraro (who almost thirty years later stared in Joe D’Amato’s The Hobgoblin) who had been the stand in for the child actor, and the case was dismissed.

The disparity between potential and actual revenue for all of the European markets suggests there are problems with the current collective rights management system. The percentage of the royalty market captured in the USA was over 4% more than the European average. New solutions should be sought to capitalize on the market opportunity of digital music services in light of increasing broadband penetration and changing consumer patterns in Europe. This should help unlock the potential of digital music markets, consolidate the single European market, increase competition in the administration of collective rights, and provide better services to European consumers".

Now, I don’t want to oversell John Carter. This won’t be the next Star Wars or Harry Potter film series, but despite its problems, its a nostalgic return to the sweeping epics of a more innocent age.
Our granddaughter Mia likes Hash browns for breakfast and her Mother is not keen on her eating the bought ones everyday.
If I could have just one wish it would be that #5 was actually true. I’m sorry, somebody else will have to wish for world peace, maybe the next Miss World. I’m still laughing at myself for coming up with that one … and yes, that is very poor form.
Later I am sitting here after dinner, you know, doing this. Watching Flight of the Conchords clips and stuff. She is rattling around downstairs.
Well, I’m pretty much 3/5 of the way done with my initial Con Law studying…through the National Power and Federalism sections with a few more hours to go tomorrow…then onto individual rights. The most amazing thing I learned today (“amazing” as relative term) was that I finally get the whole argument some of the Justices make that the 10th Amendment is a “truism” and thus not applicable in certain cases. All that is not granted to the fed. is reserved for the states…so even if something is not enumerated and would seem to be properly within the realm of the states, if the fed. has reached for some valid connection like using the Necessary and Proper Clause, because N&P is enumerated, they fictionalize this as a specific grant to the fed. under the Constitution and thus it (the N&P Clause) is obviously not preserved for the states. Duh…why didn’t I get that before? Happy to understand it now though.
BF: Yeah, of course. And since then, more than 80 countries have signed on.

How do you mark birthdays, anniversaries and things like that in your game? Do the PCs have parties? Does their culture even note the passing of years? Is there a party in Elysium for the Prince's Embrace night?

Here is the report that goes in their STAR Binders:
This book was different. The violence, supposedly real, never affected the protagonist for more than a few seconds. Sex was consensual and often (much better than violence, but not half as graphic) but never, ever, with any contraception. The poor girl is bound to be pregnant by now, and given that, is sure to be killed in the sequel.

Well, news broke out this past week that Kevin nash has been “released” and was issued his “Future Endeavored”, which means Nash will be back, and this is in storyline form. The question is where do we go from here, and will Punk speak out about this? Let’s find out together. Here we go.
“Listen sugar,” Abelle said, “its best you don’t try too much right now, see last night I injected you several times with a concoction that my granny was particularly famous for. It’s a nerve paralytic, which causes massive coronary spasms that eventually kills those injected with the poison.
Yesterday, Professor Richard Dawkins was on Radio 4’s Today programme defending his latest piece of secularist propaganda — a poll which purportedly shows that of those who said they were Christians, many did not go to Church, read the Bible or hold very specific beliefs about Jesus, and some could not even name the first book of the New Testament.
The most interesting conversation of the evening was with a man I'll call Santa (because why not? He was in red) who greeted me as if he knew me and started joking around with me; a woman who looked familiar; and a man I'd never met (ringless, but turned out to be married to the woman). Santa mentioned how often our paths cross in the parking lot near my office. I actually had no idea who he was. I can't recognize faces very well (a huge liability), and this came up in conversation. I mentioned how I say to a friend more often than I'd like "who was that who just hugged me?" So Santa asked if I recognized him when he waved at me and I admitted I did not. He asked if I knew who he was and I said I did now because he'd mentioned his first name in telling a story about a professor of his (and I'm good with names), but that I'd had no idea at the beginning of the conversation. (Did I mention I'm kind of compulsively honest in response to questions?)
I went away from it for a bit and when I flipped back to the same channel, she was running down an airstrip at sunset, screaming that name again. I remember being unable to stop watching, leaning forward, telling the the bad-perm tough-guy on the screen to just “LOOK TO YOUR LEFT FOR A MINUTE!”
Then I crept back in the trailer and, for quite some time, watched the strobe show that continued for the remainder of the night. I've seen some pretty good electrical storms before, but nothing quite this spectacular. I'm surprised the girls slept through it. Between the lightning aloft flashing at intervals so close that counting wasn't feasible, the crashing wavelets (they were still only a foot or so tall, but they crashed right on shore about 25 feet from the trailer door), and the wind blowing through the trees it was a loud, disruptive night. I woke again at 2:30 when the faucet opened on the roof, and the rain began splattering through the screens. I closed some of the windows, but it was too hot to close them all, so I left those on the sheltered side of the trailer and at the back door open.

In addition to doing as much work as I can and putting in as much effort as I can, I’m reaching out, I’m asking for help and I’m asking the universe to recognize the pure passion that I have for this. I’m asking the universe to see and to help me find a way to realize this.

The real culprit for the downfall of so many LSS is human nature. All of the many reasons in the posts above cover some of it- we want more for less, we want convenience and ease, we want it now, we want the newest, we jump in where we have no business being. But ultimately, it is our restive natures, our desire constantly to try something new, something else, our short attention spans, that have closed the LSS- and will bring back a 21st century version, whatever that may be, the next time scrapbooking is hot.

If you took some time yesterday to peruse through the photos of the last must-follow Instagram user on my list, you might have caught a few snapshots of me. Alright… yes, JP is not only an intrepid Instagram user with an eye for color and composition — he’s also one of my bestest buddies in San Francisco. He took this photo at my panel last month and this photo at my reading last year. So needless to say, I am a big fan.

I unfortunately had to rely more heavily than ever on art centres (Chapter in Cardiff, Taliesin in Swansea and the DCA in Dundee) for my movie going fix, due mainly to the multiplexes’ lack of originality in their line-ups. 2011 was notable for being the year in which the most movie sequels were released (congratulations), with a staggering 28 – working out at just over one a fortnight. It is hardly surprising then that eight of the top grossing films of the year were sequels, with the kid-friendly duo of Rio and The Smurfs making up the numbers.
Welcome to Spring, people. Doesn’t quite feel like it here in the Philly area, so I haven’t packed all my full-flavored, high ABV beers into the cellar just yet. And with that said, this week, we’re helping March go out like a lion with the Doppelbock style.

More recently, it has positioned itself in the debt space, with Goldman Sachs listing a $2 billion sukuk on the Irish Stock Exchange late last year. The Sharia-compliant bond acts as a trustee and seller of “murabaha” trust certificates. Murabaha is a contract whereby the seller must disclose its profit to the buyer.
Ah, the series that NBC won’t know what to do with. Low(er) scoring teams, great defense, and goaltending dominates this series (sort of like the one above, except L.A. and STL are bigger markets). Smith has been great for the Coyotes. Rinne has been spectacular and had to face a much more impressive offensive team in Detroit. With a little more offense than Phoenix and Rinne’s playoff play thus far, Nashville loses their first game (because they’ll be cold), but then win the next 4. Preds in 5 (I hope!).

Very interesting scene when family is gathered in a hotel room and Scottie wants to watch the adult channel. She begins describing how her same-age girlfriend watches porn all the time in the basement. With boys over. Before Matt can take charge, Alexandra lays into Scottie and handles the situation. This scene is horrifying, and in some ways treated lightly, but there’s also a sharp point being made. No spiritual arguments are made, just an extremely crude “why porn is bad” diatribe.

With this plan in hand, the code took shape rapidly. Working from outside (low-hanging fruit) in towards the more complex, the cell class was done first, then the row, the sheet, and the workbook classes. This left the parser itself, which represented the most complex object.

The Sunday Guardian headline of 14 August ‘Cabinet fires Chairman of School-feeding Programme’ was as welcome as it was surprising. It was reported that the Cabinet had taken decisive action to fire a Chairman who had been appointed about 6 months before and that is a positive step, the first time any government in this country has done that, as far as I am aware.

The white plastic one is a very flexible, scraper and mixer. I used this to mix the dough we made and it was so much better than using a spoon! Next the metal scraper, is used to cut into pieces if needed or to move the dough around on your floured surface. Maybe at some point I can take a video of this technique. Basically the instructor dumped this huge tub of wet dough onto the floured surface. She then used this tool to move the dough around, gently folding and kneading as she went. The wet dough became this pliable, workable blob. It was a really neat transition.
He's no dummy though. He has figured out that the nicer he stands and the more pleasant his expression, the quicker he gets his damn supper.

If there’s a connection there, sometimes friendship is the appropriate way to build a relationship at that time. A beta man will value and cherish that friendship for what it is, not what it might become in the future. In time, circumstances can change. People can change. But sometimes they don’t, and that’s fine too.

But legendary status can have drawbacks. It’s opened a lot of doors for Freeman, making him a familiar figure at a variety of local clubs (including the Bop Shop, the Green Mill, Pops for Champagne, and Andy’s). But appearing so often at so many places can make a performer seem as unremarkable as a crooked alderman. And the tag “legendary,” which smacks of the sort of hushed reverence usually reserved for the dead, can make a performer seem less a vital artist–one who continues to take chances–than a bloodless icon.

Anyway, I also have a new purse. I have decided I really, really like these KAVU purses. They are NOT on clearance at Target for $6.48. I've also sold my girls on the redeeming qualities of these bags, the main one is the single adjustable strap on most of the styles. It gets long, and my very tall BigB can carry on "cross-body" style without it acting like a pushup bra. It sits comfortably at her hips. The number of things she needs to carry on a daily basis out grew her first KAVU, so now she has a new one, same style as mine. MOjo was feeling left out, and I found myself continually fussing at her for not carrying a purse, so today, she got her first KAVU. We are all stylin' now. (It's lucky I had a full jar of peanut butter in the pantry, and an abundance of eggs in the fridge. )

(ii) T 0002/09 held that emails sent over the public internet (i.e not via an internal company intranet) are not deemed public. This is true even if there was a lawful reason to intercept emails (eg at ISP). The TBA was invited to assess confidentiality of emails based on their content and the nature of sender and recipent but they rejected this approach, preferring to grant emails absolute confidentiality. (iii) T 1553/06 helpfully proposed a two-part test to asssess whether web documents were public (see below). They specifically considered (6.7.4. on p.74) and rejected various other possible tests suggested by Philips or DSM (providing a further guide to the criteria which are not considered relevant for web publication). The TBA held that availability to the public comprises a two stage assessment: (i) means of disclosure and then (ii) what information is accessible and derivable from (i). Though the TBA accepted (following G 1/92) that there can be no subjective element to novelty and that the degree of burden for public to access information is irrelevant, nevertheless it held that availability on web cannot be just theoretical but also practical -- as otherwise there could be ''hidden publications'' on the web. There must be ''direct and unambiguous access'' to a web document. TBA test was (see p.72 of decision) ''If, before the filing or priority date of the patent or patent application, a document stored on the World Wide Web and and accessible via a specific URL

The power of landscape photography is in the ability to give form to all of the possible meanings that we have placed on the land. Hence the photograph gives us the opportunity to consider what the land has to offer as it is controlled through the photographer’s vision and the constraints of the camera and existing technologies. It is this aspect of fabrication that I find so interesting in the exhibition’s featured artists. Terraforming: Contemporary Discourse in Landscape Photography brings together work from six artists: Priscilla Briggs, Victoria Crayhon, Joshua Dudley Greer, Jordan Tate, Nate Larson and Marni Shindelman, who have explored the relationship between the land and the ideas it can share. The selected works in this exhibition help us examine how our understanding of the landscape is often mediated through the social context through which it is perceived. Moreover, in all of the photographs the viewer is asked to reconsider the made image through a specific context framed through the use of text. The images are thus not complete in the artist’s mind until they are shaped through use of language. This component of completion therefore asserts that the landscape is a construction not of nature but of our own, and ultimately the landscape is not a representation of the natural but rather of our own dreams and conceits.
Some of the more popular idioms were, “Couch Potato,” “Raining Cats and Dogs”, “You Crack Me Up”, and “My Eyes are Bigger Than My Stomach.” The students have fun and I am always amazed by their creative drawings. Here’s one of mine that I really shouldn’t use. Fun stuff.

To use a cliche to gentley ease into this post, I need to get back on the horse. You see, I haven’t really worked out since last Thursday. (I walked on the treadmill on Friday, but I’m not counting that.) For once in my life, I have a good reason. The day of my last post, January 13th, my mom passed away. She was 56.
Admittedly, most of the families I know are in the much lauded Spanish language immersion path at the school. We are not in that program, we are in the regular General Education English language track. I did a fair amount of outreach into our parent community over the past year, and for the first time a decent proportion of this class also is from "our side of the tracks". A bonus of this not being one of the popular schools in the city means that there are only fourteen children in Geekygirl's class.

Please allow me to make an assumption that you have a basic understanding of computer networking, such as the knowledge of how to connect computers to a hub/router with RJ45 cables, what an IP and MAC address is, and so on.

Word on the street is that they have 3 US tour dates set up for this summer. Their first stop will be Portland, Maine. My best friends sister just so happens to live there and really wants to attend the show...as do I of course. It is going to be at an outdoor venue with an amazing view of the water. It's at the Eastern Promenade overlooking the Casco Bay...really now how perfect does that sound?! Crossing my fingers that I get tickets and this really happens because
Today though, there was something different. I've never painted brand new doors before; I've never been the first person to choose the colour, the first to leave my mark. And as I sit here tonight aching from the unaccustomed exercise, I can't help but smile at the idea that in eighty years time someone else will glide a fully loaded paintbrush across the wood. I wonder what image they might conjure up of the first person who painted them.

But still, despite the insane day I had today, I managed to do some shopping before I picked up the Geej, came home, washed dishes, wiped the Oliver Twistesque daycare grunge off of the Geej, made beds (you'll see why before the end of this paragraph), put out a spread of organic olive party mix, wild rice sticks, fresh baguette, roasted tamari almonds, black pepper chevre, a lovely manchego a bunch of organic champagne grapes, and chilled wine, cranked up the iTunes station "Secret Agent on SomaFM" (under "Eclectic"--HIGHLY recommended for background work/party music), made the Geej's dinner and applied lipstick (to myself, not the Geej). You see, my cousin who is visiting from Switzerland and his girlfriend were coming by for a visit, and he's young, hip, handsome and incredibly well-traveled, and I wanted him to think I was this super pulled-together single mom. Why? I have no idea. Maybe because he's much more "worldly" than I'll ever be. (He's lived in England, Texas, Venezuela, Belgium, France, Greece, Boston and Geneva, speaks 4 languages fluently, and he's only 27.) Maybe because he's tall and handsome, young and naive, and I see a lot of myself when I was 27 in him. Maybe because I'm so painfully starved for any kind of real social life that impressing my cousin and his girlfriend has become waaaaaaaaaay too important to me.

About this, I do not joke. Virtually every opportunity I’ve had with regard to writing has come about due to Twitter, or more accurately, people I’ve met on Twitter.
Finally, I’ll mention the forced gratitude you’ll often see in sports. I used to play a lot of tennis when I was younger and, though far from good, I was generally skilled enough to keep the ball within the court. Occasionally, you’d encounter a twosome on the next court over that had difficulty controlling the trajectory of their shots, probably due in part to the fact they were wearing jeans, street shoes and half-drunk expressions. As their tennis balls trickled from their court onto mine, they’d call out “thank you” as a signal for me to stop what I was doing and retrieve their miscue. Once, a young girl was so wild that she put her ball over the ten-foot fence surrounding the court.
Earl Nightingale the radio legend. In his book The strange secret, why do some people do so very well in life and live so very successful why others do not. The majority of the people live both they are successful part of the time and not so well in other time you have heard of the saying “it is too good to last” this is this is true if we live by chance it is untrue if we live by the rules of success in everything we do.” (Earl Nightingale 1887),
Today was miserable. I managed to eat a yogurt and a cup of coffee this morning, but at lunchtime I buckled and ate some spaghetti. I should have punished myself by purging, but I kept it down. Now, I’m eating Oreos and milk–a big no no.
I’m probably going to be bored this summer, but with a lack of many interesting plans I’ve decided to put together some photo essays of sorts. Quite a few of them may lack fancy camera, but the places themselves the photos are about are interesting. So here’s the first one, from a year ago when I studied abroad for a summer in England. We took a day trip to Cardiff, Wales.

The disregard for the reader that Amis expresses is just not possible when one is writing for children. Children's writers, and I include writers of Young Adult fiction, are ALWAYS aware of what their readers will and will not tolerate, or will or will not understand. Anyone who denies this is being disingenuous. Quite apart from the target readers themselves, there are other agencies involved. We have to worry about things that would not trouble writers of adult fiction in the least - see Leslie Wilson's blog below. How many writers for adults would feel the need to explain and justify their use of swear words or the incidence of sex in a novel? How much we take these factors into consideration, how much we allow them to limit our fiction, is up to us, but those limitations are there. We do not use our full palate, as Patrick Ness would say. How can we? We have to write at a lower register because we are adults and our readers are children.
And if a non-conservative (or presumed non-conservative) like Romney defeats Obama, then Palin still has her niche.
Of course, when one arranges a demonstration for diversity it is somewhat opportune to restrain oneself as not to disgruntle ones “pro-diversity” allies and everybody seemed to be understanding of that sticking to that what unites rather than that what divides was the agenda of the day; and thus I found myself amidst the most unlikely of alliances and allies – all smiling and rosy red.

A final comment regarding the implied rhetoric of the e-book sales pitch is in order, because the e-book proponent presents the e-book as an advance over the printed book. It is not, however, an advance; it is merely different. Earlier I mentioned several items in recent history that have become obsolete—the VHS, the typewriter, and outhouses. Each of these were supplanted by genuine advances. The arrival of the DVD, and now Blu-Ray, are genuine improvements upon the VHS. The PC is better than the typewriter. And indoor plumbing is better than an outhouse. These changes are truly advances over the former things.

Happy Easter! I hope everyone has enjoyed time with family or friends. Today I’m reflecting on how blessed our lives are. Each and every day we get the opportunity to care for and experience God’s creation. He gave us our land, our animals and each other. He challenges us, too, but I often remind myself that God won’t give us more than we can handle.
When the first mermaid glided by the window the place was jammed. Half the crowd knew there was something happening with cameras, phones, and iPad's at the ready. The rest - total surprise. From the very first pass this show was incredible. All four mermaids are not only stunning but brought with them plenty of personality to go with their athletic grace. Winks, bubbly kisses, long flowing hair, and crowd interaction are what you get and all the action is right up against the glass. Very different from that other show way up the road.

I haven’t been able to shake her story since I left the dog park. How many people have been turned away from God’s love by the man at the end of the pew… or others just like him? How many times have I turned people away by being cold and unmoving or judgmental and self-absorbed?
No, I have no immediate plans, and hope to delay the inevitable for at least a bit more, but the idea of it looms larger with each passing year. With that comes some understandable "rearranging"…well, understandable to me, I suppose; but not nearly enough.
Also: a year or two ago, I'd have said that the American and German machines were pretty evenly matched in terms of quality of engineering and typing experience. That was before the Voss.

The Qur’an does not say where Muslims should pray. There are verses that say simply for worshipers to turn towards Mecca (2:149), and to not build a house of worship upon deceit, opposition or disbelief, but that it is better to build one’s faith on a foundation of love and piety (9:107-110). Unless referring to the mosque at Mecca, the Qur’an is silent on where Muslims need to congregate.

She can tell you what she is supposed to do but getting her to do something just because she is supposed to is an issue in itself. One day, I pray, it will not take stickers and rewards to get her to do what all the other kids just do because that is the way it is.
Yes, I know it's been a while but what can I say, it's summer time and there's a lot going on. Mr. K finished up summer classes at the Technical College and will start fall classes at the end of this month. Mr. J and I have been staying busy with little projects around the house. Oh, and let's not forget all the rain we've had this summer! It has been keeping us ALL busy mowing the lawn every few days. I've been trying to hide inside under the a/c where it's cool, but it never fails Mr. J somehow finds me and commissions my help.......have I ever mentioned that Jan doesn't like to sweat? No, well she don't and she don't like bugs either, and as hot and humid as it's been here lately all she does is sweat and swat bugs! Please bring on the fall! lol.
The aversion to all things Israeli has gone way beyond a normal political boycott. The obsession with avoiding Israeli stuff has nothing in common with the positive boycotts carried out by political radicals in the past, whether it was suffragettes boycotting Britain's 1911 census or blacks in the American south boycotting buses with segregationist seating.

The vet said no more dry food for Zoey. To keep her away from it, we feed Tigger on the kitchen table. Zoey has never attempted to jump that high. I started feeding Zoey Purina One Smartblend. The so-called Premium Pate. I switch between it and Fancy Feast, so-called Appetizers for cats. The names they give this cat food is unreal. And don’t get me started on the flavors: white meat chicken appetizer in a delicate broth, classic turkey recipe, chicken and turkey casserole with greens. Yum-yum.

And then there’s the For Your Health 5k the first Saturday in August at Dawes Arboretum. I got an email at work on Monday about a wellness program being led by two dudes I really look up to, especially when incomes to running. Dave and Greg are leading a Couch to 5k program for PNBers. I shrugged it off at first. Then Monte talked me into it. Again, I went after my girls to join in the action and train with me. Erica’s in…we’ll see how good I am at persuasion when I hear the decision from Amber and Danielle. I’m choosing to believe I’m convincing, for now.

A few months after we had moved, we were told our house had been torn down. Less than a year from then, three lives were lost and one of them was my brother. It was like watching a tear jerker movie only this time it happened for real. It was hard to believe that what the house used to represent was now turned into a tragedy, hurting not just one family , touching not just one’s soul to its very core.

The second running of the cup will feature a slightly altered race format for certain events. With the adoption timed events, the minimum running time for any ILMC race will be six hours (as opposed to distance/timed – i.e. 1000km/six hours). Despite the listing of several TBA notices on the calendar, one can safely assume the inclusion of both Chinese, and Japanese rounds (at yet to be determined venues) will be forthcoming at a later date.

Evans has one year left on his rookie contract and is at a crossroads in his young career. There's no doubt that he's talented but which position do you play him at? He had a good rookie year as the point guard although he was miscast in that role. But when you look at him in college Memphis' season didn't take off until John Calipari put the ball in Evans' hands and let him go.

This week I’ll be sharing recipes I’ve come up with that include some of the seven species of the Land of Israel that we should eat at on this day, the species that have always exemplified the fertility of the Land of Israel: wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives and dates. As time has moved on, Israel has become a global center of agricultural excellence and since the days of our forefathers, we’ve emerged as a leading innovator and developer of some wonderful new species of fruits and vegetables. This week’s recipes celebrate Israel’s rich and wonderful growing tradition that began in the days of the Torah.

After the coronation, Alexander, with a distant look in his eye, muses that he’s no longer Rodrigo Borgia, but Pope Alexander VI. He’s no longer an “I” but a “We”. Ok, sounds like someone’s been breathing in a little too much incense today. Cesare, who’s with his father as his heavy vestments are removed in an antechamber, tries not to look exasperated and expresses some surprise at how his father’s reacting to his elevation. Alexander continues, saying he’s very alone now, with only the silence of God keeping him company. He asks Cesare to help him interpret this great silence, as his knees buckle. Cesare grabs his father before he hits the ground, but Alexander recovers and allows his son to help him out of the room, still asking Cesare to help him.
Alongside the left wall, old stone steps wound their way up to the wonderful loggia. As we stepped into the space, we imagined the family gathered in the evenings some three centuries ago. Surely they’d be relaxing after a hard day’s work, sharing stories that gave texture and meaning to their lives—love and laughter woven throughout. Just as those Tuscans closed their day, so did we, in a similar manner—gathering to share a few stories and spend some time with each other.
“They absolutely must cut public spending and control the debt,” said Marc Touati from Global Equities in Paris. “It will soon be clear that we are in deep recession. If they don’t act fast, interest rates will shoot up and we will have a catastrophe by September,” he said. If you're a free market thinker, you're probably saying "75%? That will kill their economy - knock it into severe recession". At least, I'm thinking that. If confiscatory taxing kills their economy, and they're one of the two remaining sticks holding the Eurozone together, the whole Eurozone collapses.
Now for the fun part. Start adding the leopard prints. Some people take a slightly darker shade of whatever color you’re using and dot that first and draw the black dots around it, but I like to do it the easy way. Just draw a few black loop type shapes with your toothpick or skewer or paintbrush or whatever it is you’re using. They don’t have to be circles and they should NOT be perfect. Look up some pictures of leopards or leopard print to help you out. After the loops, add in a few black dots. Make sure they’re more like…spots than dots. Not circular. Be messy. Keep your hand loose and relaxed.

Last week’s result for the London Assembly seat of Barnet and Camden was as much a clear and overwhelming rejection by local people of environment policies being implemented in Barnet – particularly around parking and road safety – as it was a rejection of London-wide policies pursued by the former Assembly Member.

This was a minor crisis, a mere adventure in the grand scheme of things. Even the children were unphased by the news that Mummy would be back a day later than expected. I showed up at work the next day in a snazzy LA souvenir T shirt, having been reminded that so much in our lives is beyond our control, and is instead in the hands of the randomness of chance. From now on though I will always carry cash, and have spare pair of knickers in my handbag.
This one has always puzzled me. If a real place, why not name it? If a fictional one, why not give it a fake name? The best answer I have for this little convention is that it signals the line between fact and fiction. To give the name of a real place pulls the narrative toward fact, imposing restraints that the author might not want (for example, does Dostoevsky want us to be thinking of real St. Petersburg locations with such specificity? How does that change our experience of the story).
Scott eventually left The Feel and went on to play in The Orbits, and later, The Shivvers. By mid-1979, Martin, Greg and Jim had come to their own as The Baxters, a well-rehearsed trio.

More worrying inconsistencies are revealed in the Macpherson Report, as they affect the police. Members of another gang with convictions for racially-motivated crimes were not known to the investigating officers. Having earlier lambasted DS Davidson and other officers for their refusal to accept the race factor in Stephen Lawrence’s murder, Macpherson, three pages later, has no sense of embarrassment in stating: ‘The view of many of the team that the murder of Stephen Lawrence was not solely motivated by racism may well be reflected in this failure to obtain readily available local intelligence’ (para, 20.14). Whether this failure was due to incompetence is not clear but it surely mitigates Macpherson’s accusations of “institutional racism” levelled in paragraph 19.44.

They were wearing life vests and cold weather gear — equipment that gave rescuers hope in the search for the missing. “There is the possibility that the other four were also in the same kind of gear,” Read said. He said he didn’t know if the four missing were the same crew members who were swept from the boat. The search was expected to continue through the night, as long as there was a chance there were survivors, the Coast Guard said.

In British Columbia, why is it important to keep the Canadian Pacific’s Armstrong Subdivision in rail operations and prevent CP from selling it off for non-transportation use?

Düsseldorf is one of Germany’s most boring towns together with Hannover. In opposite to Hannover Düsseldorf had some really cool bands in the past like Can, Neu, Kraftwerk, DAF and so on. Now three young guys from there are trying very hard to sound like their idols of the past and they are succeeding quite well in it on their first album: Douze Pouze. There is a thing about this whole retro-wave. i always wondered why i should buy an album of a “sounds-like”-band if I will prefer the originals anyways. For this reason i won’t recommend to buy this one. In any case it’s their first release so may one of their next albums we gonna see if they have the potential to find their own way. A name to keep in mind? Definitely yes.

In the hands of a less confident actress, a line like, "Don't ever touch a raptor" would definitely come across as comical (the added ruffled bird feather sound effect wouldn't have helped). Yet, Piper brought just the right amount of fearlessness to the role of the headstrong Paulie, that we end up believing that she is genuine pain. Seriously, the amount of gusto she brought to the proverbial table was astronomical. It's the kind of character you can't do half-assed, and Miss Perabo, utilizing the entirety of Perabovian arsenal, dives in at full force.

Being in the military, we have the illusion of freedom of speech and there men in hats who troll the nets looking for people who work for the government who step beyond outside the bounds of that invisible fence, probably the same people who track terrorists, cyber criminals, haters and that lot, nice people you get grouped with. Stein crossed the that line, probably didn't think much about it at the time but it's the line drawn at the core of our oath of the military of a country that elects a civilian leader to call the shots instead of a military government. Most of the people who complain his discharge over this issue are people who haven't served or military people who have only taken that oath once, for the people who have taken it more then a few times and can still hear it ring in their heads, we look at it a bit differently.

This recipe is a vegetarian play on the traditional English Friday night take-away dish: Battered Fish with Mushy Peas & Tartare Sauce you would get from the local fish & chip shop. They had me at battered Halloumi, but the addition of minty mushy peas really sealed it for me. The tartare sauce recipe is mine. I don’t like capers or gherkins (cornichons) so I substituted them for pickled onions, which I love, and it worked! I also added some coriander as well as parsley. The result is better than any tartare sauce you’ve ever tried, I promise. The addition of the nori seaweed is from the book and is, I have to say, genius. Nori seaweed is what you use make sushi rolls and the flavour of the sea it gives to the sauce is so spot on, once you’ve tried it you’ll wonder why you’ve never done it before.

A poor appearance can be a subconscious signal that you have low self-esteem; and no woman wants a man who lacks that inner confidence and drive.

The next day, I promptly made my way down to Toronto DJ institution Play De Record not even knowing the proper title of the track nor the artist. Clearly, Eugene Tam and crew had been tipped off about this one(no surprises there) as a batch of 12″ vinyls bearing the iconic Roulé label and the simple title “Music Sounds Better With You” – Stardust were displayed very prominently upon my arrival. As I was examining this somewhat vague single-sided pressing, the remaining copies were scooped up and paid for by about 6 other DJs who clearly had had a similar experience to mine. I have never seen anything like that at any record store since, so I promptly paid for mine (the $14.99 import price being well worth it) and headed home to give this tune a proper spin on my home system.

Krono and I were silent for a while. Watching the morning fade into noon. Suddenly, Krono lifted his head and sniffed the air. “What is it brother?” I asked. He shushed me and stood, leaning his head just outside of the cave opening. “I thought I heard something.” We both listened intently, our hearing very acute, and mainly built to pick sounds of the smallest up. There was nothing, however, and so I laid my head back down. “Take yourself a nap, Krono. It is simply the sickness of being on the ground for so long, messing with your senses. Nothing is there.” He sighed but laid back down next to me, and faded off to sleep.

Anyhoo....The following are photos from a reunion/celebration of F.A.'s life(our young friend who died) that Dylan organized via FaceBook for the kids who attended the Optional Program with F.A. in elementary school. At the end of each school year, the Optional Program would go on a field trip to Eklutna Lake. So that's where they decided to meet up. It wasn't a huge showing being a busy summer and all, just this group of kids and 2 of their former teachers, but it was fun and very bittersweet. And unlike the end of year field trips, there where NO rules about playing in the ever present Eklutna mud!!!

She looked around, and she seemed okay—I felt the lower part of my body begin to defrost and I slowly made my way over to her. Before I could ask how she was, she jumped on the boy. She must have been twenty-four, twenty-five pounds at the time, but she marshaled all of it to knock this kid to the ground. She then started punching him in the face. Not little kid punches, but very well executed pistons: Left, right. Left, right. Raining down hurt on this boy. And she wouldn’t stop.

Here's a close up....
The producer they wanted was booked up, so the band was flown out England to work with Bob Sargeant. He listened to them rehearse and didn't like their "hooligan music," so he pushed them in a much more pop direction. They spent three months in Europe recording the album, but by the time the record came out, they didn't have a management company behind them and they ultimately slipped through the cracks. By early 1984, the band broke up as De and Glover were very unhappy with the new direction and quit.
It's time to congratulate them on their success -- again! -- and mark it as a celebration of the success of Pennsylvania craft brewing -- American craft brewing -- as well. The numbers keep swelling, and beer is more varied and more available than ever. Victory will be opening a major beer hall in Philadelphia this year, Sly Fox and Tröegs are bringing major new breweries online, Yards continues to expand, and we're finally -- finally! -- seeing a new wave of brewpubs in the area, something we've been waiting on for years (and thank you, Iron Hill and McKenzie for keeping the lights on with new places).
Just cook the pancake on one side and take them out. Place them in a plate rubbed with oil.
When I received the Candy Doodles CD I had a quick flick through it for inspiration and almost instantly found the little birdhouse template and the butterflies. Now those of you have followed me for any length of time know what a sucker I am for birdhouses and butterflies, so I just knew that I had to make something with it. My only problem was what to do as I had way too many ideas running around in my poor little head!
the official website promotes its overnight accommodation services for horses that are just passing through, one of the main selling points being the racecourse’s location within easy reach of the Rocade, the Bordeaux motorway ring-road. A stable with hay bedding will cost €20 per night, or you can splash out on wood shavings for €30. So plenty to ponder there if you are passing through Bordeaux with a
We've come a long way baby..........
This leads me to another issue I’d like to address: I do not begrudge Kelle her success. This seems to be a very popular accusation to hurl at anyone who is not a fan of Kelle’s. What I do begrudge her is the materialism and vanity and sense of entitlement and self-congratulations she, at the very least, portrays (though I’m positive these aren’t the qualities she intends to portray). It’s a turnoff to me. It’s not what I think life is about, and I guess I’d like to see something deeper gained from having a child with Down syndrome.
In my daughter's eyes,
And how much did you pay?
This actually stemmed from her religious beliefs. (Now I'm all for people believing whatever it is when it comes to religion, but in her case she's a loony tune and phony when it comes to being a Christian.) She spouts off all the time about the bible and her beliefs. She's a homophobic bitch as well. As a parent of a gay daughter I quite frankly get tired of hearing how my daughter and all gay people are hell bound. She always starts this nonsense when a gay couple, or I should say, a suspected gay couple in her mind, comes into the store and she doesn't want to work with them. I usually keep my mouth shut because she isn't worth arguing with, but I'd finally had enough of her crap so we pulled a joke on her. While she deserved it, in hindsight the boss got a little too carried away with it.
to Sun flare activities…to temperature change,
On a slightly more serious note (if you consider war and people getting their hearts cut out to be serious. And I think you do) this is my favorite drama, hands down. Braveheart is for sure quite worthy too, but this one makes me swoon. I can hardly believe that villainous Wes Studi went on to play the Sphinx (he's terribly mysterious) in one of our other ridiculous comedy favorites "Mystery Men." That movie makes me snort with laughter - Mystery Men, not Last of the Mohicans. Also, Zoolander. But we were talking about Last of the Mohicans. It's beautiful and perfect and sweeping and inspirational and luscious.
Desperate to prove his innocence, Nora follows the trail of blood, no matter where it leads. It ultimately brings her to the ancient streets of Prague, where she is drawn into a dark web of secret societies and shadowy conspirators, all driven by a mad desire to possess something that might not even exist. For buried in a centuries-old manuscript is the secret to ultimate knowledge and communion with the divine; it is said that he who controls the Lumen Dei controls the world. Unbeknownst to her, Nora now holds the crucial key to unlocking its secrets. Her night of blood is just one piece in a puzzle that spans continents and centuries. Solving it may be the only way she can save her own life.
And there you have it! The three most common ways to characterize. How do you create your characters? What method do you prefer/practice?
For me personally, I do not like FPS games. (That's "first person shooters" for you non-gamers out there). Not because they are "violent" or "graphic" but simply because I am not coordinated enough to properly aim, fire, and survive. Hubby is excellent at FPS games, but I think that's because he's had actual military training in how to aim and shoot weapons. Younger people who don't have this sort of background experience are good at these games because they have "young eyes" and "young reflexes". Now mind you, there are a few FPS games that I can play because their targeting system seems to work with my idiot brain. Games like Metroid Prime, Gears of War, and Halo are games that I can handle. Call of Duty, on the other hand, were it real life, I would be dead in .0000000001 of a second.
Happy Anniversary to Me!!! (Note, I have run this same post for previous anniversaries...feel free to enjoy once again now!!!)
So brace yourselves for a trip down memory lane and enjoy the essence of nostalgic atmosphere.

Once upon a time (a few weeks ago) in a lard far far away (midtown Manhattan), I was escorting a cousin from out of town to meet a potential internship coordinator. For my services, I was promised lunch at the brand new Momofuku restaurant, Ma Peche. While we waited in the lobby, I noticed another young woman approaching the guards to sign in.

Today I found out the answer to my wonderment: the writing skill, of which none of them have an ounce of. I let them write a memo with a partner in class today. After a full lesson on how to do it, step by step, they had their chance at it. Here are some of the papers I received. I have included all errors.
“From what little reading I’d done, I concluded that I was possibly witnessing the activation of some kind of hologram. Inert materials primed by artists and activated by readers brought this universe to life and allowed it to move on another week, another month, another year. Every time you interacted with it, you were different, and it became different in response. You saw things, gained new insights. The best comic stories never stopped delivering surprises.
THE FUN FIVE – Not every movie is Citizen Kane. If you look back at some of your all-time favorites you may find that more of them are like Star Wars. They may have their share of problems but they’re great anyway. They’re FUN. Isn’t that why most people go to the movies? FUN? These are the movies that aren’t top ten material but were so damn enjoyable that I have to give them a shout-out.
hands down winner every single time. It's closest competitors
Does the Servant in Isaiah 53 refer to the messiah? There are two reasons I’m raising this question today. In Bart Ehrman’s new book, Did Jesus Exist?, he addresses this issue briefly. Part of what makes the story of Jesus real, Ehrman claims, is the fact that he was a “crucified messiah” and this was something that no one would have made up. He states,
Because of the blood of Christ forgiveness is available to us.

As a graduation present to himself in 1990, Chris joined a mountaineering expedition to the Himalayas. That experience, and other adventures through developing countries, inspired Chris to found HeRO (The Hunger Relief Organization), a 501(c)(3) non-profit company committed to ending world hunger by coordinating the efforts of other non-profit associations. It is Chris’ belief that through Public Awareness and Transparent Accountability, we can end world hunger in our lifetime. HeRO currently feeds and educates over 1150 children through seven (7) feeding centers in Central America.In 1998, Chris began writing an entertaining golf guide called Point Your Johnson at the Ball – Simple Steps to Better Golf. The primary goal was to create a lighthearted “How To” manual that was both amusing and informative. As a result, Point Your Johnson at the Ball – Simple Steps to Better Golf is filled with techniques that are fun, creative and often outrageous. Look for it in stores in early 2009.
THE penultimate blog from remembering Imola focuses on the career and the life of Ayrton Senna, eighteen years after he tragically perished at the wheel of the Williams FW16 in the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. Forget Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher. In my opinion, Senna was the greatest ever human being to drive in Formula One.
The Highveld Horse Care Unit is a Section 21 Company in its own right, responsible for its own management, funding and operations, and is the largest equine welfare organisation in the Southern hemisphere.
A lot of things went into Above Reproach and its writing, but above all, a lot of love of country, of my fellow citizens and for the freedoms we have directed the course of the book. And at the base of all of that, is the Second Amendment which protects and gives strength and teeth to the other amendments.
Another variant of the story involves a “hill of fire” (volcano), an arrow and a bird (kingfisher).

Counter Human Trafficking organizations all over East Africa have the potential of establishing an annual update report whereby even dealer in the filed would share what is happening on his/her side.

But then, today, the clouds cleared, the ones in my head anyway. Despite interrupted sleep again, (Leo lost his wolf twice in the night, Tansy lost her duvet, the cat brought a mouse in) we had fun. Decorating gingerbread for Granpa's present we sloshed chocolate and icing around in a sticky relaxed mess, without any uptight concern from me about how much sugar had gone into Leo's tummy instead of onto the gingerbread moomins.
Like the fluff there is no miniature support for Good, but this is not a problem as you can literally take ANY miniature to play with as everything is game for Good. Fantasy VS Sci-fi, Civil war solider VS Paratrooper there is nothing wrong here it’s all Good (you seeing a theme here?).
What our life and work will look like when we return to Haiti is once again up for definition. We have been keeping in contact with Global Ministries and the Vilier's. Patrick hopes to plan a trip to Haiti soon to find a home for our family and discuss with the Villier's their hope for our work in time to come. I hope to resume clinical outreach on the CONASPEH land, re-establishing a family practice presence in the community and linking in with medical outreach centers already working in the city. CONASPEH has voiced interest in utilizing groups visiting from abroad to help rebuild and reconstruct their buildings and catalyzing their projects. Patrick and I will likely play an active part in mission interpretation and trip planning for friends coming to learn, listen and lend a hand.
The New York Times had an article it published earlier this year,
We shall see, in time, whether the term ‘university’ continues to have any real meaning. In the meantime – I shall nip orf to think of other things.
But I don't just want to be a successful writer in the monetary sense. I want to write good books, books that touch people with characters that people care about. And I think I know now how to to know when that happens.

This is an enjoyable movie overall that I think people who have both read and not read the book and for all ages. Good story, good characters and an interesting period make this the best movie I’ve seen this year so far.

Let's get the obvious comments out of the way. Alexander MacLeod is the son of Alistair Macleod whose story collection, Island, I reviewed here last year. We could say therefore that his son has writing in the blood, although by that rationale I would be busy practising medicine somewhere right now instead of dressing up in silly costumes and pretending to be other people for a living. It does hold true for MacLeod Jr however whose debut collection of stories is written with a confidence that comes presumably from not having rushed into publishing his work (at the age of 40 he has been occupied up until now with teaching and family), resulting in a collection which has been nominated for Canada's two biggest literary prizes and therefore gained attention beyond those shores. Most of the stories here are merely satisfying but a couple of them are really great, the 'worth the price of admission alone' variety, so that I finished the book pleased to have been introduced to a new writer and interested in what he might produce next. What more could you ask of a debut story collection?

Take a look at the picture provided for a visual. Make sure when you make the pudding, you let it chill in clear dessert dishes. If you are using the sweetened condensed milk, place a little bit in a small bowl and add a little water and mix well. This will make it a little runnier so it will run off the spoon nicely when your drizzling some onto the pudding.If your using the sweet whipped cream, place a dollop of the pudding and slightly flatten. Dust a small amount of finely ground coffee granules on top. Lastly, sprinkle a small amount of crispies and serve immediately. Enjoy!

Apple offers users a single choice: what model of iPhone do you want (3GS, 4 or 4S), not what company’s phone and then what model. Of course, some people may prefer the greater choice Android offers. Others, though, will appreciate the simplicity and quality offered by the iPhone.
In Steven McKay’s article, he writes that Filipino men were “emasculated” when they are working onboard foreign ships headed by non-Filipinos. The article details how many Filipino seafarers suffer depression and discrimination onboard these foreign vessels. The majority of Filipino seafarers are discriminately not allowed to rise in the ranks of captain. In McKay’s research, he finds that there is a very disproportionate number of Filipinos working as ratings in proportion to the number of Filipino officers:

When printing my contact sheets I actually printed it too light, however this was good as It showed me all details that cannot be seen when printed at the right exposure. I printed my contact sheet twice, one was too dark, one was too light. The darker one showed how much detail I had captured from the sky, and the lighter one showed me more of my model. I have edited the lighter one to get a picture in the middle of the two prints.
There’s a plaque on a wall Just as you enter Gran Via from the Calle de Alcalá. It commemorates the memory of Nicolas Peñalver, mayor of Madrid at the time that construction commenced, and his efforts to promote the building of Gran Via.

For now though, I’m currently making plans to go stay with my parents for the Easter holidays (a.k.a. Spring break! woo) whilst my boyfriend will be spending time in Poland, as of Tuesday. And so normal keep-busy-whilst-your-boyfriend-is-away-and-you’re-at-your-parents’-away-from-normal-routine protocol will ensue. Its at times like these when, besides doing the usual chatting with family members and catching up (which, let’s face it, wears out after the first couple of days, and then you’re just getting in their way) I’ll be doing my best to make this next week and a half the most productive I possibly can. As well as the two mammoth assignments I have due in after Easter (totaling 8000 words, of which I have written nada), the countless graduate applications I’ve had building up, and my insistent determination to return to learning my Polish that I inadvertently seemed to abandon after Christmas (guiltyguiltyguilty), I am also going to be taking part in this April’s ScriptFrenzy.

Clark Gregg is good too, and his demise is a surprise to me. I knew someone was dying in this movie, but I had Hawkeye pegged for the role, or maybe the Widow.

Have you ever been in a position where life is going great and everything seems to be going your way, and then……you wake up one morning and all hell has broken loose? You go to work just to find out you don’t have a job anymore! What? You helped build that company. What do you mean no job? That can’t be. As far as you knew, everything was going great. “God, why didn’t You warn me? What am I supposed to do now?” You’re sure you will have a few weeks left to find another job and to break the news to your spouse, but you find out that today is your last day! The company cannot keep you on one more day. Your cell phone rings and it’s the school. One of your kids just fell and needs to go to the doctor. “Ok, I’ll be right there.” You run down to your car just in time to see someone speed off. Your car has been backed in to. Great, what else could go wrong? You can still drive it so you pick up your kid and head for the emergency room. After you wait several hours, you are told that your insurance has been cancelled and they need cash before they will treat your child. At this point, all you want to do is put your head in your hands and cry! However, you can’t, you’re the adult! You take a deep breath and call on God for help, even though you haven’t really been hearing Him lately. You call a family member to bring you cash. They fix your child and now you can go home. On the way, you remember the back of your car is smashed but you don’t have another nerve left to take care of it right now.

Brazil nuts are one of nature’s best sources of selenium, an important mineral for the health of your scalp. Walnuts contain alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid that may help condition your hair. They are also a terrific source of zinc, as are cashews, pecans, and almonds. A zinc deficiency can lead to hair shedding, so make sure nuts are a regular on your healthy hair menu.
Real world story, from someone with no axe to grind. Poor Pennsylvania. Poor us.
Alexander was a thinker educated by the philosopher Aristotle and realised, Diogenes was able to stand outside the Maelstrom, watching and being entertained by the turmoil of human activity. While Alexander was very much embroiled in it and even though he most certainly rose to the very top, he gained no more happiness from it than did Diogenes. Alexander for all his prowess envied Diogenes for this, once remarking to his generals “If I were not Alexander, I would be Diogenes”.

I'm not going to recommend this to anyone because i am assuming that you are going to wake up a little late one morning (at least) and only be able to do your hair and not makeup. bask in your naturalness.. because you're worth it!

We expect babies and toddlers to wet their beds simply because they are not fully developed or completely potty trained. That’s why we put diapers on them. But when adults have the same problem, involuntary urination while sleeping, we are much more judgmental causing those with the problem to actually alter the way they live. Adult bedwetting, or enuresis nocturna, can cause extreme embarrassment for those who suffer with it.

Therefore, I must confess, I was once a Boy Scout leader. I learned Boy Scout songs, I helped build a wooden race car, I created so many weekly activities I could pull them out my ass by the time it was over. I ate meals in a church, horrible dirty food we had to pay for, on paper plates. I spent time in the company of the Q’s, a Boy Scout leader family extraordinaire. Our family spent time with families we had nothing in common with, people we didn’t want to know.
Ghee. Chickenandcowlady has been generously supplying me with ghee. I am MOST grateful. I am not even sure how to say how much I appreciate or express how much I love the stuff. But, curiosity and a sense of independence grabbed hold of me, and I decided that I should try to make it myself. Now, I have no cow, so I knew there was no way I was going to duplicate what I'd been used to. I purchased butter in bulk (4lbs) at Sams, and followed a ghee recipe that CACL had sent me a link to. I think she sent me the recipe, not so much for me to make it, but so I'd understand the process, and what happened as butter was transformed to ghee. (chickenandcowlady is entirely to long, and it ticks my spell checker off every time I type it, so hence forward, CACL is it.)
What was interesting to me is that that line would’ve roughly corresponded to the northern extent of the Beaumont blackout, 13 years before.

If your bank account were a pre-paid can of beans awaiting collection that was eaten by your supplier and refilled without your knowledge; would you be O.K. with that?

Shouldn’t the bean stockists pay for that or go down in the attempt? In what way is that debt your debt and your unborn childrens’ debts? Here’s the good news – go to jail for not making the payments and you’ll get some beans for free. A sane society balances itself, right?

Stephen Richer (Washington Legal Foundation) has emailed with an item for PatLit -- this analysis was published last Friday by Washington Legal Foundation. Titled "Supreme Court To Address Standard For Induced Patent Infringement – An examination of Global-Tech Appliances Inc. v. SEB, S.A." and written by Brian Pandya (Wiley Rein LLP), this not explains that the issue at stake is whether 35 U.S.C. sec. 271(b) carries a scienter requirement (i.e.that it must be necessary to prove that an alleged infringer has actual knowledge of the patent before he can be liable for inducing patent infringement. The note adds:
Think about what happens whenever any of us argue with reality, when we resist what is. We might dwell on how much we hate the fact that the new neighbor has moved in down the street, or that the liberals or the conservatives are in charge of Congress (as the case may be). The problem is that the neighbor has moved down the street, and the liberals or conservatives are in charge, just as William's son has decided not to attend college. In any of these cases, it's eye-opening to ask the question: how is resisting concrete reality going to help? Or put it even more bluntly, is there any chance whatsoever that fighting reality is going to make you feel better? The answer is- and will always be- No.
The truth she does forsake
This past Saturday, one of our weekend regular babysittees slept over (we know a pile of kids whose parents call us when they need a night out. The parents get a break, my kids get a sleepover, everybody's happy). She and D are buddies and spent much of the evening hiding on the recliner together under a blanket tent and giggling. Sunday morning, we discovered that the friend was crawling with lice. Is your head itching just thinking about it? Mine is! Anyway, after her mom had collected her we gathered every soft surface the kids had played with (I am STILL washing those!), steam cleaned the chairs and couches, vacuumed the carpets, and buzzed D as bald as his Daddy. He thinks it's hilarious and loves that people keep rubbing his head like a good luck charm. I'm still traumatized.

When she asked if the telly was actually turned on, or if I had forgotten to do so, I got a bit, um, authoritative. It took her 30 minutes to tell me to press this, and reset that, and hold this button, and enter this PIN that you will find underneath the modem on the other side of the room, only to find that none of it worked. At which point, I simpered, "So, now do you believe me? It's B-R-O-K-E-N".

As for Craft Beer UK, it appears a producer club rather than beer drinkers club. Just what the industry needs, another trade organisation. If you have a brewery is it worth joining? You have to decide for yourself. Is there a benefit to pooling resources to promote the sector in general or are you better of promoting your own brand on your own? Don’t ask me. What does appear pretty clear is that the membership criterion appears a bit in flux. Yesterday it appeared only open to small brewers making beer the existing members liked. Today it’s a public vote. I guess they have some thinking to do. If I had a brewery I wouldn’t want to join a club that defined “craft” beer as anything that would impede my future business. I might want to build a bigger brewery, expand my market and export at some point. I might rue the day I joined, funded & helped a bunch of upstarts define craft beer in a manner than eventually chucked me out and no longer let my beer be officially “craft” I might see the sense in keeping the definition of the term nicely loose to mean whatever anyone wants it to mean.
The asbestos issue is interesting. The 2002 news report quoted above suggests the asbestos was removed some time ago, but the La Trobe case suggests that the university had to pay double the purchase price ($8 million) for the asbestos removal.

So, where exactly is the irony in this story? It happens in a seedy motel room, during an encounter with a complete stranger, a stranger who turns that encounter into something more than it was supposed to be. I can’t say too much without giving things away. But suffice it to say it’s poor Jesse who suffers irony’s unrelenting sting.
Amazingly Sonko scored in Pompey’s 2-1 away win. How that useless lump found the right net is a minor mircale. Liam Lawrence also scored as he looks to be doing for Pompey what he did for Stoke in the Championship, scoring and creating goals all over the place. Top player and Pompey have a winner so long as he starts every game as he doesn’t like sitting on the bench!

Apologetics of course cannot be free from the guidance of the Holy Spirit.But it does not have to be “Sprit vs. Logic.” Why not both? We must not forget that the Holy Spirit is required to move one into believing.The Holy Spirit can choose different ways for different persons.With some people God uses trials; in others it is an emotional experience; in others it is through reason. God can use whatever means He wants.

These thoughts coalesced into a plan. Everyone with a serious illness does this. We make a Big Plan for what we're going to do, the way we are going to live after successful treatment. When health returns, we are going to live the way we were always supposed to, not looking back, but making as much as possible of the here and now. I suppose, though absolutely everyone goes through some variation on this theme, that a lot of people let it slide. They go back to the patterns that have governed them their whole lives. It's human nature.

The very first addition by Apollon. I’m about fifty-fifty on this one. On one hand, it’s not difficult for me to distance myself from interested deities now that Apollon is taking a more active role in keeping them away, but I’m still struggling with breaking bad habits, and general mental health issues.
An engaging and genuinely funny series from start to finish, Infinite Stratos doesn’t even try to be a different kind of harem series with cool armored suits but, in the end, it still manages to be a fun series that doesn’t take itself too seriously. As a result, Infinite Stratos ends up being a series with nothing new to offer but still has enough good things going for it anyway.
I've read a couple of these books now. Titanic, which was ok. And Pompei, which didn't inspire me enough to actually blog about it. But you can check out the Wondrous Words it inspired. Twice. Neither of those was a Royal story, and of course I'm quite interested in France, so was interested to try Marie Antoinette. Although of course, Marie Antoinette was actually Austrian, not French.

“Cancel the sweetheart deal for Forest City Ratner,” said Council Member James. “Forest City Ratner should pay the $100 million owed now for the purchase of the Vanderbilt Yards. I also question why Forest City Ratner is not being made to pay the millions of dollars owed for the naming-rights deal upfront? And, had the MTA accepted a higher bidder, they would have received their funds upfront and their current budgetary gap could have been cut almost in half.”

There is no way that you can come to this city, set up in Greenwich Village, sing gospel songs, preach sin and damnation and not expect a confrontation.

I did assume that the person in mind does cook Indian occasionally and wouldn’t mind stocking up on garam masala (and although I have never tried curry powder, but I think I can say that you could substitute it if that’s all that you have “Indian” in your kitchen. I do realize curry powder is not the same thing as garam masala but curry powder does serve the purpose of giving a little Indian touch to the dish)

Both the tragedy and the mystique of the Titanic figure strongly in all of our minds, and it is no surprise that they are a looming influence upon The Millionaire’s Special. For in setting it aboard a doomed ship – and no, that is not a spoiler (unless of course, you have not seen either the film directed by James Cameron or the recent television series written by Lord Fellowes; and curiously, I have steadfastly seen neither, so I had no idea that the ship sank) – Gauntlett not only faces a challenge, but has to set one too. The challenge he faces is one of presenting an adventure in which there is an unavoidable deadline, one that neither he (as the author) nor the players (as the protagonists) can avoid. The challenge that he has to set is making the adventure interesting enough to divert the attention of the players away from the impending disaster.
This hits on an important part of the lifestyle change that I want to elaborate and make a point to talk about. So much of my spending time with friends or Anthony or what have you involves going out to eat. It’s easy to forget that there’s a whole world of stuff to do that doesn’t involve eating! I think Anthony and I might, in future weeks, go dancing, which is fun and exercise!

In this heavily-anticipated sequel to 2012 Enigma, (#1 Most Viewed on Google, 12/1/08), David Wilcock presents a compelling case that the prophecies of a Golden Age are not myth or superstition. Our DNA has been evolving 100 times more rapidly in the last 5000 years due to a natural galactic process which is also creating climate change throughout our entire solar system. If the prophecies are correct, psychic abilities and powers such as telekinesis, levitation, spiritual healing and telepathy may soon become as common as breathing.

I want to share that I've been reading The Voice New Testament~Step Into the Story of Scripture, Thomas Nelson's newest translation of the Bible which just last month has become available, and I LOVE IT! What I love is the easy readability of the text, but not only this, but also that it brings to CONTEXT information not readily known by those who might not be as familiar with the Bible as a whole. Over the passion week of Easter, I read along with a friend the chapters of John 12-20 which cover the events of Jesus' triumphant ride into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, His prayer in the Garden, arrest, trial, crucifixion and resurrection and of course the after effects of all these events on His disciples. WOW, The Voice NT made John's (the disciple WHO JESUS LOVED~ya think John THOUGHT HE WAS Jesus' FAVE??? LOL)account of these events come to life! Here's an excerpt along with the King James Version (KJV) so you can see for yourself what I'm describing~and I WANT to get the whole entire Bible in this storying version which has been translated with great detail to the ACTUAL Word in the original languages of Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic.

The look, overall, looks quite purple-y and this may just be due to the lighting. However, the different shades blend together quite well and I'm curious to see what other looks I can create with this pallete. The downside of this pallete is that I was expecting it to be a little bit more pigmented and possibly even more sparkly. When you first look at the pallete, the surface of the shadows are very shimmery, but after you start using them and remove the top layer, you realise it's actually a bit more matte. Don't get me wrong, these are still shimmery eyeshadows!!

We already know Katy Perry is fearless–she married Russell Brand and has dyed her hair every color on the rainbow, but we didn’t know she had it in her to rap. Last month she covered Jay-Z and Kanye West‘s “N***as in Paris” during a live performance at BBC Radio 1. “This is about to get real embarrassing,” she said before launching into it. While she censored all the expletives and made it a little too clean, the rendition is really not “embarrassing.” She even brought out the rapper in her complete with a Yankees fitted on. Not bad at all.

I can’t fault Kassay entirely for this. After all he is young, and perhaps the impulse is to bring a little resolution and a little art historical positioning to a practice that is probably more at home in explanation-less experimentation and straight ahead aesthetics. With the ballet barre, suddenly we are allowed to think of performance, of metaphor, of the history of Rauschenberg, his performative collaborations, and his white paintings, the idea of a monochrome as blank surfaces or "landing strips" for dust, light and shadow. All of this is fine and will probably be developed by Kassay in the future, but you get the impression that he is ahead of himself, as everyone is currently of him.
The transfer of governance is likewise making great strides. Various parties that dearly wish to change the face of the world have joined us. At present, the dark cabal persists in plotting a number of military adventures but these will be stopped by our galactic family together with the militaries of several western nations sympathetic to these moves. The time has come to rid governments of those who would use their militaries unwisely. The age of war is over, and so those governments that encourage this insanity need to be removed. Various agreements to this end are now in force and are moving in lockstep with many law-enforcement and prosecutorial agencies which are close to arresting those primarily responsible for this bellicose behavior. Soon, new governance will deliver peace, prosperity, and global cooperation!

Despite 6 weeks of doggy classes, praise for good behaviors, positive training, and hours of frustration, Maggy continued to jump up on people and bark and lunge at other dogs on our walks. The on-leash dog reactiveness was the pits. It made walking her really difficult. Case in point: I tried taking her to walk around the lake and I brought GLOVES so I wouldn't destroy my hands when she yanked and pulled. We made it up the hill to the cement path, down to the damn 20 feet away, and turned around. In that time, we had encountered two dogs and Maggie's barking and lunging was enough to embarrass and injure any doggy mama.

Throughout the series, I bring up the idea of appreciating what you have while you have it and appreciating the little things in life, because you never know when they could be taken away. That's something that I try to live by every day. Other themes crop up, but that and the idea of doing good no matter how badly people try to tear you down are the strongest.

When one is not in the situation, it is easy to analyze: Well, we have much to be thankful for, at least there is food to choose from, we have a stove and oven and running water, ect ect. But. When one is in the situation, and one has negative thoughts that are not stopped in their tracks, it is not good.
So here are my photos. Please know that, like a lot of things I saw in Peru, they don’t at all measure up to the experience of actually being there.
I saw a video that had game written all over it. A woman is singing it, too. I'm not sure if she gets it, though my guess would be she does. The thing I noted, from what she was saying? This is the kind of woman I would romance, for a while, perhaps, in the past. But as soon as certain conditions were met or she started getting too... something... I would flee to the hills for my life. These girls are dangerous. They eventually come to think you are as into them as they are into you. Even now I would be careful with a women who exhibited such signs. Wearing my shirt, fine. Using my wash water, cool. Using safety pins to wear my (clean) underwear, sort of, so long as she doesn't try to go Lilith on me. Sharing my toothbrush? Not so much. Anything beyond that, absolutely not. Flee!
I recently repeated the exercise using rates of 4 percent on the 30-year loan and 3.125 percent on the 15-year. With these rates, the break-even return is 6.15 percent, or 2.15 percent higher than the rate on the 30-year loan. The larger rate spread between the 15- and 30-year loans increases the difficulty of developing a profitable reinvestment strategy.
Note: I enjoyed it so much that I am planning to read The Pursuit of Love, which is the first book in the trilogy, and Don't Tell Alfred, which is the final book.

Wow, I am so lax about posting to this blog. Luckily tonight I'm just pissed off enough to have to write something. I just got a message on etsy that basically told me one of my chokers was overpriced. Way overpriced. Something about how they would be willing to pay up to $20 for my 30 some-odd hours of work, but $100 was out of their price range. Oh, and as if it were possible they threw in "no offense." Well, offense definitely taken. I understand that there aren't enough people out there who understand how delicate and time-consuming tatting is. This is I've started adding to the listing that the large pieces all day over 20 hours of work. This is a low-ball estimate for some pieces. I guess I just don't understand how you can basically tell me that my piece isn't worth the price I'm charging and expect me not to take offense. You expect me to take less than $1 per hour for skilled work and not be offended.

The small cut on my face seems much larger today now that it's scabbed over and healing. I've had a throbbing headache that started as a dull pain when I got up at 4 this morning to catch my flight and has steadily gained steam all day long. Now that I'm home I've had a chance to lay down for a while and it is feeling a little better.

For years and years, the ‘perfect school’ was defined by having the right ratio of black to white, native to migrant and rich to poor. However, recent Dutch research has exposed this myth. Children at mixed schools consistently score lower grades than their peers at predominantly white or black schools.

Very adorable photo, I was just super stumped...I was taking it way to literal, and was really struggling with it....so when I showed the hubby, the first thing that he noticed was the "sibling rivalry" in the photo....of course his solution was use pics of the girls arguing...at this point I was desperate, so I started going through photos to find that I didn't have any of them not getting along, not playing around and just being the buds that they are...so I got to thinking, and they really don't fight much, they are best friends, soooo....I decided to scrap that. The fact that right now there aren't those kind of issues, but that I know one day it will happen, I just hope they get past whatever it is to stay as close as they are now.

It’s the same thing with birth. It usually takes about nine months, but sooner or later the organs decide that enough is enough, and send out some signal which is the chemical equivalent of, “Look, kid, you’re cute and all but you’ve become a major pain. You’re cramping up the entire place, all you do is just lie around all day kicking us, you suck down more food than the rest of us put together, and you haven’t paid your rent since you got here. We’re really sorry, but you’re going to have to find someplace else to live. Now beat it! And don’t let the cervix hit you in the ass on your way out.”

hell. We’ve all heard the stories about an editor coming back with a 50 page revision letter. While nothing that severe has ever happened to me, it very well may have happened to other authors. However, I don’t think that’s the norm. This isn’t to say that I haven’t gotten revisions, or that I have agreed with all the revisions my editors wanted.
Taylor, you say that you have "Lakota Sioux roots," and that's great. But if you explored those roots a little more, you would learn that until 1978, American Indians couldn't even legally practice our spirituality that you so openly appropriate--sweat lodges, naming ceremonies, "vision quests"--all illegal. That is why it hurts many of us so deeply when we see these practices being appropriated or mocked. If you wanted to form a company that "reflects" your roots, I'm pretty sure your Lakota elders would not have told you to rely on stereotypes.

A little help from a bigger brewer was also necessary to bring the bottle on the right to the market. De Verhuisbrouwerij - the portable brewery - is a "hobby brewery" run by five enthusiasts in Antwerpen since 1998. They bring their 30 liter brewing facility with them in their caravan to your party/event, where you can witness a typical 9am to 5 pm brewing session. The beer that is brewed in the session, is only for the brewers' own consumption, though (following the legal definition of homebrewing, I suppose), let alone available after a 3-month process of fermenting and maturing. Knowing Belgium, it would surprise me if informal arrangements cannot be made to overcome the legal bits.

There are always long queues at our local pharmacy... much chat goes on about what is new, what works and how. Body products are big business in France and there are plenty of 'flavoursome' tonics, pills and gels that promise the world... well, at least a newer slimmer, less ragged you...There are always promotions which need to be shared... the buy-this-and-get-the-other-one-free kind of deals that we expect in a department store not the family run pharmacy... and then there are the freebies, échantillons, with every purchase... I can't remember a visit to the pharmacy when I haven't come away with a bag full of product samples... and I have lost count of the beach bags and umbrellas that have come home after a stock up. They even call up from time to time and offer a free beauty treatment or a maquillage...This generosity is only one of the reasons the French pharmacy is on my 'go to' list when in France...
Since the moon will be as close as it ever gets, it will appear "as much as 16 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter than other full moons of 2012—not a huge amount, but definitely noticeable," said Geza Gyuk, an astronomer at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago.

Muteppou has ramen houses in Nara and Osaka, although it's the shop in Kyoto which is most famous. At Muteppou, people will happily queue for an hour for a bowl of their famed ramen.

It is these chemicals that effectively explains hair color, as anti-hair-lice agents. How safe is it? Well, synthetic pesticides manager porous are absorbing a growing child may well be MAD – bad except that the dead are an embarrassment of epic proportions.

When it does happen, many parents are shocked that school police officers would use the same tools to subdue students as they would suspects in a street crime. However, not every school district in Texas will share its “use of force” policy with parents — and the public interest law center Texas Appleseed is going to court to change that.
Clapton first visited the United States while touring with Cream. In March 1967, Cream performed a nine-show stand at the RKO Theater in New York. They recorded Disraeli Gearsin New York from 11–15 May 1967. Cream’s repertoire varied from hard rock (“I Feel Free“) to lengthy blues-based instrumental jams (“Spoonful“). Disraeli Gears featured Clapton’s searing guitar lines, Bruce’s soaring vocals and prominent, fluid bass playing, and Baker’s powerful, polyrhythmic jazz-influenced drumming. Together, Cream’s talents secured themselves as an influential power trio.

Let's start the enquiry into this train wreck with the gameplay. The central gameplay mechanic is "+success", a system that rewards you points for successfully doing things within the games universe. However, most of these events are incredibly trivial, have little-to-nought to do with the storyline and basically require the player to be psychic (or to have written down everything they've observed throughout the course of the game).

I felt the need for a slight background on the back cover and i think the metal fence wiring works really well not only as a reference point to the film but if you notice it not where its supposed to be and looks upside down- symbolizing schizophrenia and things are not always what they seem which plays an important part in the film.

The story is about a young girl in 1930's Alabama, her life and her family, including her father, Atticus. The crux of the story of course is Atticus's defending of a black man who is on trial for the rape of a white woman and all of that trial's repercussions. I don't have any groundbreaking insights to offer, just that if you haven't read it yet you really should, and I highly recommend the audiobook version.

In part two, I will focus on the second type, and on a planned show trial in America. It is a case which never actually got to court, but which stands as a frightening example of the threat faced by young white males, in societies which are intent on holding them responsible for other people's crimes, and which view them as the single remaining legitimate target for racial hatred. It is a case which became widely known as the Duke Lacrosse Rape Hoax, and became one of the most high profile and talked about crimes which never happened in American history.

Sohail Sen has created the music for Katrina’s tapori item song, and it has been learnt that the glamorous babe has been asked to look more beautiful and sizzling than she looked in Tees Maar Khan.

Let’s say you’ve got an idea for a historical novel that takes place in 1933. There’s this pair of teenagers who figure out what really happened the night the Lindbergh baby was abducted, but before they can communicate with the police, they themselves are kidnapped. Their captives take them to proto-Nazi Germany, and it turns out there’s some weird relationship between Col. Lindbergh and the chancellor—or is there? Is the guy with the haircut really Lindbergh? The teens desperately wonder: What do they want with us?

Promoted as a win-win for both institutions, the deal may be a bigger win for NYU. Poly alumni who question the deal say call it a land grab--though a definitive analysis is impossible, given that details of the deal remain confidential Poly, with a $135 million endowment and some prime real estate, is worth hundreds of millions of dollars--alumni suggest $500 million--but NYU wouldn’t pay out any cash initially, even though it likely would have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to start its own engineering school or gain a beachhead in Brooklyn.

I now come to the last part of our time in El Salvador. And as I reflect on it, I noticed something so wonderful and creative. It’s God’s perfect timing. How wonderfully does He orchestrate things. How perfect and wonderful is His timing. Understand, that God’s time is eternal and perfect. How we view time, obviously isn’t the same way that God views time. And it allows Him to have these virtuous qualities, that we fail to understand daily. In a world, that is so fast paced, we become impatient and want things immediately. We want instant gratification. But as I gained this final, concluding truth, I came to understand something important. Time is in God’s hand. While we were in El Salvador I shared one of my devotionals with the team as we normally did, and I’ll share it in this post.

The Sri Lankan government’s cooperation in this endeavour is informed by the background of Western media depictions of the island’s political scenario. For over two years sweeping generalisations have been presented that depict Tamils throughout the island as “fleeing from persecution.” This is a characteristic oversimplification and blanket categorization common to media beat-ups directed by market aims.[13] But some Sri Lankans deem this image to be a slight on Sri Lankan honour. It arouses Sri Lankan and Sinhalese anger powered by patriotism.

If you look at him, if you interact with him, if you converse with him, you see a sweet young man with an infectious smile, a sense of humor, a robust laugh, and an intense desire to be of help. You see a young man who loves video games, Yu-gi-oh, Pokemon, and anime and being right. You see a young man who may not be able to spell or write with any kind of ease, but who is smart enough to figure out how to record his voice on his phone and text me the grocery list by embedding those audio files in the text. Pretty damn awesome, if you ask me. You see a young man who loves animals and willingly cares not just for the six cats here, but for my mother's cats and birds. You see a young man who's never too busy to sit down and hold and love on an animal or spend an hour talking to the parrots. You see a young man who loves to read and devours books, but often needs help straightening out his perception of the book because he didn't know enough of the words so that it's confused him and who misses all inferences. You see a young man who hands those books over to his mother to read after he has finished because he's eager to discuss the books for hours. You see a young man who's learned to cook, and who delights in concocting new dishes and who takes a fierce pride in successfully navigating a store on his own while his mama waits in the car, sometimes on the phone with him and the rest of the time with her fingers crossed. You see a young man who will be 23 this year who rarely focuses on what he can't do and who is continuing to grow and learn and develop skills.
One of the voices in Beckett’s That Time remembers the folly where he hid as a child of between ten and twelve looking at a “picture book” and talking to himself for company, making up “imaginary conversations” while his family were out in the dark looking for him. The protagonist in Company reminisces about being a small boy coming out of Connolly’s Stores and other of Beckett’s characters try to gain some comfort in looking back to, if not the good times exactly, then the not so bad times. The protagonist in Verruca Music recalls being fifteen:

Alright, yes, Christmas 2011 seems like a distant memory now that it is mid-April and the end of the school year and summer are within our grasps. Yet, in the same breath, it seems as though we never really left last summer. What I mean by this is that we had a very mild fall and winter that led into an unusually warm spring. In fact, some cities in Michigan have recorded some of the lowest amounts of snow falling in their history. Some places only saw an average of 5 inches in a given month. This makes it seem like we did not really have a winter and it does not seem like another school year should be wrapping up yet.

The following day she did get up when I came to feed her, clearly having decided that it was a little too boring to spend all day at the stable. She tasted her food and looked out the window, drank from the water and tasted her food again. It took her at least an hour to finish up her meal. She was not in a hurry. I got her out as the last thing I did before I ran to catch my bus.

After the independence of Bangladesh Cox’s Bazar started to get the administrative attention. In 1972 the town committee of Cox’s Bazar was again turned into a municipality. In 1975, The Government of Bangladesh established a pilot plant at Kalatali, Cox’s Bazar to assess the commercial viability of the heavy mineral content in the placer deposits of the area with the cooperation of the Australian Government. Later, in 1984 Cox’s Bazar subdivision was promoted to a district and 5 years later (in 1989) the Cox’s Bazar municipality was elevated to B-grade. In 1994 (jobs) the Marine Fisheries and Technology Station (MFTS) was established at Cox’s Bazar. MFTS is a research station of Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI) headquartered in Mymensingh. The station covers a land area of 4 hactor and is equipped with 5 specialised laboratories, and one indoor and one outdoor cistern complex. In April 2007 Bangladesh got connected to the submarine cable network as a member of the SEA-ME-WE-4 Consortium, as Cox’s Bazar was selected as the landing station of the submarine cable.

These have been on my Pinterest I NEED board for a while. And I actually just snagged a similar pair in blue for a fraction of the price at Francesca's. But I still love these. Perfect color for spring and I'm trying to wear earrings more now that Evie isn't yanking on them quite as much.

Film summary: Once upon a time… or maybe twice, there was an unearthly paradise called Pepperland, a place where happiness and music reigned supreme. But all that was threatened when the terrible Blue Meanies declared war and sent in their army led by a menacing Flying Glove to destroy all that was good. Enter John, Paul, George and Ringo to save the day! Armed with little more than their humour, songs, and of course, their yellow submarine, The Beatles tackle the rough seas ahead in an effort to bring down the evil forces of bluedom.
For my post, I was able to write about one of my most favorite topics, the Harry Potter series, this time in the form of He Who Must Not Be Named. Be sure to pop over and check out my take on The Dark Lord’s bid for immortality. In case you are not convinced yet, I will give you a little teaser:
I just cannot get over the ease of my experience with the health care system here. Every time I have had to seek medical care, I get this trained pit in my stomach from being hassled by the American system for so many years. And I am young and had full health coverage! For all my friends who have NO coverage, it's just an inhuman NIGHTMARE. All the hour long phone calls I have made to insurance companies over the years...for ridiculous things like fighting over why I should not pay $300 out of pocket for a mammogram as it is preventive care and is covered. (Apparently not if you're under 35 even if it was prescribed by the doctor....and why is a mammogram $300 in the first place?) I have not had to pay off thousands of dollars in dental bills in installments over three years time. The list goes on....

Let’s allow the Director of Intelligence to speak for himself:
So much for the worst case scenario. It could well be, of course, that the story in question isn’t leaving you hanging simply to build up suspense for the next installment in the franchise; it could well be that it’s a standalone, and that’s just the ending the creator had in mind. I don’t care for that, either (though it may not call for the screaming that the “Pirates” example did). I like my stories tied up with a nice, “And they all lived happily ever after.” Or, “And they all had to lie in the beds they made, for better or worse.” Or, “And they all died in fiery explosion just as Gore Verbinski called a wrap on the filming of ‘Dead Man’s Chest’.” Whatever, just so long as this plotline feels conclusively over. Otherwise, I’m inclined to feel cheated.

Anyway, I loved the film, I thought Natalie Portman was absolutely stunning in the film, I think this brought out Natalie Portman into her own, her own style, her own ‘perfection’ if you will.

5) Every SNP council will work with the Scottish Government to investigate ways that the billions currently held by pension funds and invested beyond Scotland can be rechanneled towards infrastructure projects to improve the quality of life for Scotland’s people. This is in addition to innovative sources of finance already being developed, such as Tax Incremental Financing.

I do not consider the conservative impulse to be necessarily 'evil'. It's certainly one of the psychological traits that has kept us alive in very strenuous evolutionary situations in the past. Not every member of the caveman tribe should feel compelled to put their hands in the fire to test out if it 'really hurts' like the village elder told them, nor should a second hunter-gatherer go up to pet the rhino next to the pulverized remains of the first one.

This week we'll be covering the letters P through U as we wend our way toward the final week of the challenge. I plan to be covering the topics of Poetry, Reputation, Savings and Investment, and Time. And don't think I forgot Q. I have a very special post scheduled for Q-Day Tuesday. It will be a coming attractions promo piece of our May 3rd Blog Event. I am hoping that we will have Challenge-wide participation for May 3rd and I hope to have many readers for what we all have to say.
1) a 1951 Singer sewing machine, in a beautiful blond wood cabinet, with some pretty retro lines. The whole shoot and match works like a dream, and there is even a little secret hide-y drawer that Steve discovered the other night - FULL of old notions and such. Goosebumps! The best part? This machine came with a zig-zag attachment which is totally rockin' awesome. Eleanor and I tried it out today for the first time and it worked beautifully. I can now sew knits! Ah!
Team Cee Lo was up. Cee Lo first said that he has said many times that he has 2 of the best contestants on the show. Jamar and Juliet started crying before the results were announced and I really felt bad for the both of them. Can’t we just allow both of them to go on?? Cee Lo divided his scores as such: Jamar – 40; Juliet – 60. He said he wanted to be honest, critical and fair. He said Juliet’s performance last night was so beautiful, striking and strong. Jamar has been so consistent and America loves him. He said he couldn’t appreciate everything that Jamar did in that song and he felt it didn’t translate completely. With America’s vote: Jamar – 79; Juliet – 121. A resounding roar of approval for Juliet. My heart is heavy. I know it probably only came off this way on t.v, but after the results were revealed and Cee Lo joined the two on stage, it seemed Jamar gave him the dirtiest look ever. I think he was just feeling numb.
I also thank Dan for taking the photographs. I must admit that from the moment I walked in the door I was so "in the moment" of being there that the thought of taking a photo would never have occurred to me!
Heth and Jed have been rockin' the tunnels of New York City as well as the clubs, colleges and concerts for all their fans and have an upcoming show at The Parkside Lounge on March 2nd at 8pm on the Lower East Side. They are supercool and play some kickass music...If you can see them, def go out of your way to check them out.
Just makes me think that all those pages where we blithely click the "I Accept" box as, wide eyed and full of hope for the future, we upload our art to the internet will probably come back to bite us in the posterior.

Last year kegged Chocolate Ale was available around the area infinitely longer than the bottles. If you don’t get a bottle check out a local watering hole as they will most likely have pours of Chocolate ale for weeks after the initial distribution. I tried mine last year at the Flying Saucer well after the initial bottles were gone. KCbeerblog has a list of dates some local establishments will be tapping their Chocolate Ale.

I can't wait until I feel like Stephanie again. I don't know who I feel like. But not me. I feel more like a being that's been to the moon and back, and is in shock---kind of dazed, and blah.
I think on average my day has been pretty decent, except of course for the morning, and the reasons for just why I went into work after six months and stayed there all day despite wanting to leave several times because I had things to do at home. Things I'm now too tired to do. No you can't know what that reason was.
See? Nothing exciting.
I also really liked “POP ATOMIC” by Mikaty Slade and Emily Lang. [SLURL]. From the notecard: “The ATOMIC bomb changed the Japanese people forever. 8-bit console games are a loving part of Japan’s POP culture nowadays. I felt that both the atomic bomb and the 8-bit consoles are powerful symbols of 20th century’s civilization, at least as experienced by the Japanese people. And, so, POP ATOMIC was born.”
They were guest to emperors and kings, indigenous people examined them filled with curiosity, they slept in palaces or just on the ground, welcomed as princes or chased as dogs.

Milligan said managers were told to document and clean off any racist graffiti immediately, but he said one such case he handled in his nine months at the plant was "swept under the rug" when the person behind it turned out to be a relative of another manager.
Is it being purposely ignored, or is there a lack of knowledge within the media about the subject?
This probably isn’t right and I would advise myself to love all people, no matter what idiotic things they say, or how stupid their haircuts are. In fact, I would tell myself that every time I met someone new, don’t just shake their hands, but hug them and hold them tight, then whisper in their ears about how much you love them.
I am Punjabi, I attend all the weddings in my community, and we sit around singing classic songs by a dholki, This has got to be the reason Mausam’s “Sajh Dhaj Ke” will forever be on my iPod. The nod to classic Punjabi songs made me smile and introduces the songs to a new generation.
The exhibition will feature approximately ninety designs and thirty accessories by Schiaparelli (1890–1973) from the late 1920s to the early 1950s and by Prada from the late 1980s to the present, which have been selected from from The Costume Institute's collection, the Prada Archive, and private collectors. I'll be attending the press preview on May 7th and writing a review for Fashion Projects.

Seven different addresses, 15 roommates, eight jobs, and seven years living in this city, and the allure of this gorgeous haven continues to resonate something fierce with me. I still possess a sense of wonder when I walk down streets en route to attend events, meet friends, or with an intent to explore. I get to live here, here in a mecca of art, of music, of culture that is unparallel to and unlike many places in the country. It is a complete privilege that my addresses have had the zip code they did and do. Sure, maybe I haven’t shaken off that naivety, that romanticized bubble of awe about something new and being enamored with it, from when I first moved to this metropolis at the tender age of 18 to attend college. But if that’s the case, I don’t ever want to lose that feeling. San Francisco makes my heart swell with such sharp joy, it’s been yet to be duplicated by anywhere or anyone else in how much it permeates to my core.

Can you smell the berries and spice on the nose, and taste the juicy bright cherries, dried pink rose petals, and loamy "funk" in our Pinot Noir? Can you believe that the Sarver's sell this for only $20? I think it's one of the best Pinot Noir values in all of Oregon. And, if I may say, not terribly unlike some good French Burgundy's I've had.

I struggle with the idea that Adelaide is no longer a baby. Only 15 months old and I consider her a kid. My brother-in-law pointed out that the dictionary defines a toddler as an infant just learning to walk, and obviously Adelaide is past that point. She's been walking for a whopping seven months now. She's a kid.

This sycamore shares a field with a standing stone, as you can see in the photo below. We don’t know how many centuries the stone has stood there: sometimes I wonder about the changes it has witnessed to the landscape, as the seasons swirl around it like water around a rock in a river. (Once some archaeologists came to excavate the soil around the stone. They were very excited to find the skull of a horse. Evidence of a pagan Celtic cult? No, some estate workers had buried it there for a little joke at the expense of the learned archaeologists!) If stones could talk…

Know anyone who did Atkins? Sure, some people were successful in shedding pound, but did they keep it off? The majority of people who saw some marginal success slammed the pounds back on as soon as they started eating carbs again. The idea that you can live without carbs is a myth! Your body literally needs carbohydrates to survive. You can get them from healthy natural sources like dark greens, nuts, and whole grains.
Bruce has switched over to throwing red clay from our porcelain clay. The color is yummy and we think it looks good enough to eat. We love the way that some of our glazes come out on the red clay.

The March 2012 Glymm Box was initially disappointing, but I thought better of half of the products after some use. So far, the April 2012 Glymm Box is not overly impressive – we’ll see how it goes after I try some of these out. May 2012 may just be my last Glymm Box, if I don’t feel better about this box and the next one doesn’t wow me.
OK so all in all, I spent this whole review comparing two beers that are of two different styles, but at the same time have the same flavor profile. They just hit the tongue different. Do I prefer wheat beers? Kinda. Do I still like this beer? Yes. Is my dog jealous of me right now? I don't know... why the hell would my dog be jealous?..
Still, let’s say you buy the idea that all those who rioted were on benefits. Once they get out of prison, this latest crop of offenders will find themselves less employable: their education interrupted, their criminal records dissuading employers. We’re going to deny them access to state benefits, so presumably they’ve got a straight choice between begging on the street, or theft.
As we move into studying the prophets, my next post will include some tips on interpreting prophetic literature, and we’ll take a look at the book of Amos.

Of course I am fully expecting for things to change just as they did with the first bathroom.

Because of the greater variety of hardware used in Android phones, Android’s battery life is more varied and, on average, less than the iPhone’s.

Muir-Wood’s paper was originally commissioned by Roger Pielke, professor of environmental studies at Colorado University, also an expert on disaster impacts, for a workshop on disaster losses in 2006.
