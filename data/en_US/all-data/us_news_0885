The detective work that built the novel remains controversial. "Nowhere in all these pages was there an outline or other indication of what order David intended for these chapters," Pietsch writes. "There were a few broad notes about the novels trajectory, and draft chapters were often preceded or followed by David's directions to himself about where a character came from or where he or she might be headed.

Readers will want to stick around. "Middle School" has a keen appreciation of kids' insecurities and an even more astute understanding of what might propel boy readers through a book. Not only is Rafe's plight relatable, so is the manner in which he expresses it. The lingo is casual and humorous, and as self-aware as one might expect from an 11-year-old. The book is well-stocked with pen-and-ink doodlings by cartoonist Laura Park that mimic the look of notebook creations by actual sixth-graders.

LATE-NIGHT UPDATE: Just a quick comment on Wednesday night's 8-7 loss. Hey, the bullpen has to shut it down. The relievers have given up 14 runs over the last two defeats in Colorado. These are pros. There are no excuses. But that said, I wonder why TLR was so quick to remove Boggs after two batters in the eighth inning Wednesday. With the bullpen stretched thin, and with minor-league veteran Evan MacLane looming as the last line of defense, I don't think the Cardinals could afford to run through so many pitchers as quickly as La Russa did in Wednesday's loss. Boggs gave up a line-drive double and got a ground out. Hardly a smackdown. But he was replaced by LH Miller, who simply does not have a feel for pitching at Coors. And that's when the game began to unravel. Boggs needed to stay in that game a while longer. And that was a horrible spot for indoctrinating MacLane into the big leagues, throwing him in to face a RH hitter (Iannetta) who has some pop. Iannetta slaughtered a 3-2 pitch for the game-winning HR. But what is a manager to do? TLR was short on relievers after using so many over two days.

In a small Kansas town where everyone knows him, Chris is seduced by Gary Spargo, a local thug, into serving as a lookout for a ruthless crew of bank robbers. Gary is played by Matthew Goode; he's a marvelously scary study in sociopathy. Jeff Daniels is less flashy, but no less forceful, as Chris's mentor, Lewis, a blind man who speaks wisely if too loudly. And Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Chris isn't flashy at all. To the contrary, this painfully vulnerable, often befuddled young man seems to be thinking his way through every moment of every hour as he struggles to sort out right and wrong, and solve the mysteries of his fragile identity. We saw what Mr. Gordon-Levitt could do in such diverse films as "Mysterious Skin" and "Brick," and in the TV sitcom "3rd Rock From the Sun." But this performance is something else. It's unforgettable.

Despite that diversity, evangelicals have become a reliable -- and increasingly crucial -- Republican voting bloc. Many were drawn to Bush in 2000 because of his conservative stance on social issues and his story of turning to Christ to overcome a drinking problem.

For starters, the majority opinion conflates the presumption of innocence afforded to a defendant prior to conviction with his expectation of privacy. Judges Mary Ellen Barbera and Alan M. Wilner correctly note in their dissent that arrestees' expectations of privacy are diminished in far more intrusive ways than the collection of DNA by means of a cotton swab rubbed for a few seconds inside their cheeks. They are subject to thorough searches of their bodies and possessions (including strip searches, an intrusion the Supreme Court recently blessed), and are observed in states of undress by police and fellow detainees while in jail. They are not even given privacy to use the bathroom. Even the process of fingerprinting could be considered more intrusive, in that it involves covering an arrestee's fingertips with ink.

Afflalo's 19 points came on 8-of-19 shooting, and he added five rebounds and three steals in an all-around solid performance.

Discovering small wineries is one of the joys of being a wine lover. Tell your friend you found a great new winery, R & B Cellars, and give a bottle of the 2003 R & B Cellars Swingsville California Zinfandel ($10). The owner and his entire family -- who live in Alameda -- are musicians, hence the names. And there's no way to tell, from looking at the stylish bottles or tasting the fruit-forward wines, that they cost only $10 to $12. They're not made in large quantities, so if you can't locate R & B, wines from Stephen Vincent -- a similar small local producer -- make a good alternative.

Many Nigerians who have traveled in recent weeks have had a taste of the unsavory experience of being treated as potential terrorists. A day after the aborted Christmas Day bombing, a Nigerian traveler suffering from diarrhea was forcibly removed from the toilet of another Northwest flight bound also for Detroit. Wole Soyinka, the 1986 Nobel laureate in literature and a frequent traveler, has described his recent trips as "stressful."

Yeyo tequila is made from organic blue agave that grows for 8 years before being harvested. It's made in small batches, cooked for 72 hours in stone ovens and distilled in copper. The distillery even plays classical music while the tequila ferments, which Bullinger says "relaxes" it.

Alex herself says she was the lone child at a peanut-free lunch table and that other children acted afraid of her.

None of those will be easily accomplished, nor will a salutary call for a second look at tax rollbacks on real estate, which shift part of homeowners' tax bills to all Ohio taxpayers. But tough times call for tough choices -- and the resolve to make them.

Things won't be different this election season, Mr. Romney should know. The race card will be played even more energetically this time around, despite such proof of racism as white America's overwhelming support that put Mr. Obama into the presidency in the first place.

Of course, the senator now has a fat target: the four years of the Obama presidency. But so has Mr. Romney.

The FedEx envelope looked ordinary. White, with the purple and orange logo. It arrived recently in the newsroom. The packing slip listed the sender as Philip J. Guyett Jr. Placing the name took a moment. Guyett? Wait. Wasn't that the guy ... the guy who sent body parts via FedEx?

The Missouri Department of Transportation has cancelled the planned closure of two eastbound lanes of Highway 40 (Interstate 64) near downtown St. Louis this weekend.
Worthy is a pretty good prospect but might be more of a nose tackle than a pass-rushing three technique. In his most productive college season, he had 4.5 sacks. He didn't have a great combine but worked out better at Michigan State's pro day. He came out early and still has some growing up to do. Those are the reasons he isn't rated as highly as some of the other defensive tackles. I think he should be a solid NFL player though.

Keep pressure on the nose for 10 minutes without letting go.

TR: It's a lot of just day-by-day. I take notes every day and write down things that I've been learning and working on throughout the day and things that I want to continue to reflect on.

For Romney, the only better outcome than an Ohio victory would be wins in Ohio and Tennessee. His detractors say he’s weak in the South, the heart of the Republican base, and Romney got wiped out in South Carolina (he did win Florida, but that’s really not a Southern state). He’ll sweep Virginia on Tuesday, largely by default; Newt Gingrich and Santorum, who live in the Virginia suburbs outside Washington, failed to make the ballot. Taking Tennessee would quiet criticism about the breadth of his appeal and could help make Romney the presumptive nominee.

The restaurant has also upped the dessert offerings, using Indian ingredients in a more Western approach such as a fresh coconut cake ($8) infused with curry leaf syrup, and a beautifully executed tart tatin topped with mango and chile ($9) and served with caramel sauce and a yogurt mousse.
