The Plaza, opened in 1907, has a notable history even by the standards of Manhattan hotels. It is home to the precocious title character, Eloise, in author Kay Thompson's series of children's books.

Tap on any image to see it larger and tap different parts of the image to see animations, like an electromagnetic spectrum diagram in a science textbook that showed frequency and wavelength as I tapped on images of infrared lamps and lasers. A two-finger pinch returns the image to its place in the book with a playful animation.
8. So who finished "second" in the manager search? I don't think it really matters. I think Matheny had an edge because Mozeliak likes him, but he strengthened the bid during an impressive three-hour interview. (Matheny may have had home-field advantage, but still. You either interview well or you don't. And the quality of the interview usually has no real connection to how the winning candidate does his job.) Management never warmed up to Terry Francona; the stuff swirling in Boston created anxiety in the big offices at Busch Stadium. Ryne Sandberg interviewed well, but didn't have that built-in grasp of the Cardinals' organization. The Cardinals are spinning that they really liked Class AAA manager Chris Maloney, but part of the goal there was to line him up for a coaching job with the big club. Joe McEwing wasn't quite ready. Oquendo interviewed well, but not as well as Matheny did.

Is this an issue of money or spending priorities?
A structure near Russian Hill, for instance, might survive a quake intact while an identical building South of Market might suffer near-collapse. The difference? The soil beneath the buildings. In one infamous example of what can happen on filled-in marsh or bayshore, the Valencia Street Hotel was four stories before the '06 quake rumbled through, and only one story shortly thereafter; three stories sank into the unstable fill as it liquefied, killing an estimated 100 residents.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture hasn't revised the food pyramid -- the agency is scheduled to review it later this year with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. But here's what the USDA and the HHS says we should do now: Make sure half our plates are covered by vegetables and fruit, our milk is low-fat or skim, we eat at least two servings of fish a week, we make half the grains we eat whole grains, and we cut back on saturated fats.

Pre-planning keeps hot chicken wings from costing as much as a ticket into Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, reports the National Chicken Council. A single chicken's two wings are a small contribution to the 1.25 billion wing portions (100 million pounds) expected to be eaten during the weekend. Thus, restaurants and food service providers began stockpiling them long before the Rams won a game in late October. That keeps the hot appetizer affordable.

THE PRESIDENT: Generally speaking, though, the -- what I'll do is just talk about what I've heard in some of these forums. In addition to financing, I think the other thing that people really wanted to find out is how can they get mentored and partner with some larger businesses. And we're very lucky we got Steve Case here who obviously used to be with AOL.

A preemptive strike based on Iranian bluster and threats never struck me as a good idea. Then again, those missiles aren't pointed at me. A reminder that there are two distinct camps among Jewish Americans when it comes to evaluating Israel. To the Trust Israel Always camp - older Jews, fervent Zionists, Standard Club members, those not prone to critical thinking - the idea is, these are the guys who raided Entebbe and whupped the behinds of their Arab foes for decades.

There are a couple that I'm sort of wearing in advance — like the ones I got for wiping Israel off the map and being the first man to walk on Mars — but these things are only a matter of time — I mean, you don't buy a pair of shoes without first trying them on, do you? I need to make sure that the ribbons match my beard color.

The 26-year-old outfielder burst onto the scene two years ago in spring training. He was called up last year from Toledo and played in 78 games, hitting .251. That number wasn't inline with what he'd done at every level of the minors, however, so when Dirks led the Grapefruit League in hitting this spring, the Tigers chose Dirks over outfielder Clete Thomas.
That led to the most remarkable moments in the entire process. The 49ers, represented mostly by Jed York and his father, scheduled a series of neighborhood block meetings. Sitting down in living rooms and community centers, they answered questions about the team's plans.

That's why some lawmakers and county health officials want to proceed more cautiously than Brown has proposed, waiting to make sure that the shift to managed care works before committing to it statewide. They're right to be concerned, but the state's fiscal realities cannot be ignored. Policymakers and healthcare providers must change the financial incentives in Medi-Cal and deliver more value for the dollar through better coordinated, more effective care. The governor's proposal may not be the complete answer, but it's the right starting point.

Some medical texts continue to say that the normal range for resting heart rate extends from 60 to 100 beats per minute. But that's misleading. Many recent studies make clear that it's increasingly unhealthy to have a resting rate above 60 beats per minute. The risks of dying from heart disease rise steeply at rates above about 70 beats per minute. Among highly trained athletes, it's not unusual to have a resting rate around 40 beats per minute. Higher rates are an indicator of lower physical fitness. But researchers have also found that a higher resting heart rate is independently associated with arterial stiffness, a feature of atherosclerosis.

Some trailer music composers are tempted to venture into film scoring — Bergersen and Phoenix were part of Zimmer's composing staff for "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," for instance — but most say they stick with trailer music because of the freedom it allows. They create a library of music with their own vision instead of a film director's.

It's death by a thousand cuts: mites, moths, insecticides on crops and on seeds, and now this creepy fly. We collected several dead bees from the ground and kept them in a jar, and thankfully nothing hatched out of their heads.

LeGree was one of the top small college players in the country and was the active NCAA leader in interceptions with 22 at the end of last season. It was a remarkable rise for LeGree, who went to a small high school in Georgia with a graduating class of just 28 and got just one offer — Appalachian State — for college.
A: Danno, Ta'amu is certainly on the Broncos' radar at defensive tackle. In fact, he's just the kind of player who will be available after the first round in this draft and why the Broncos won't feel compelled to take a defensive tackle with their opening pick — at No. 25 — if a defensive tackle is not the highest-rated player still on their board at that point.

Both figures are based on county voting numbers in recent elections. What's unclear is whether the group must get the signatures within a prescribed time frame. The county website says it has 90 days, but county elections director Joe Mansky said that provision isn't in the county charter.

Recent polls have anticipated a double-digit lead for Hollande in a runoff with Sarkozy. A victory would make the 57-year-old Hollande, sometimes criticized for being bland, only the second Socialist leader in France's history.

Of the teams with the best records, which one do you think is the most likely to burn out over the second half? I'd say the 49ers, but they play in such a pathetic division that it again could be won with a 7-9 record.
When I hear Christopher Owens' shimmering guitar and singular, yearning voice on their great debut, Album, I'm reminded of a less fiery Kurt Cobain.

The help will come in three ways.
I'm sure you'll ask me about the President's announcement that he'll be making today in Cleveland that he is appointing Richard Cordray to his position as consumer watchdog for the CFPB. The President feels very strongly that Americans deserve someone in Washington looking out for their interests in their dealings with financial institutions. The President nominated Richard Cordray, as you know, nearly six months ago. He has broad bipartisan support. He's enormously qualified. A majority of attorneys general, both Republican and Democrat, support Richard Cordray and his nomination to this position. He won a majority of votes in the Senate. And yet the Republicans in the Senate refused to allow him an up or down vote. He had majority support, I should say, in the Senate.

What America needs is a balanced approach to promote growth and opportunity and not just one focused on either spending cuts or higher taxes alone. President Obama has at least shown some willingness to move in this direction (although his efforts in entitlements have been underwhelming); the GOP seems to be stuck in a more rigid, doctrinaire view.
Nike executive Julia Brim-Edwards, who directs the Nike School Innovation Fund that is paying for the work, said the biggest gift Nike gives the schools is time -- time to take a deep look at their own results, their teaching practices and the results as they try to do better. Having high-level Nike executives involved also helps schools think outside the box and make sure their strategies align with the goals they are trying to reach, Brim-Edwards said.

The Great Comet was also one of four such fireballs carefully recorded over the course of four decades in vaporous yellow pigment brushed lightly on a small piece of black-painted tin by the great, self-taught Mexican portraitist Hermenegildo Bustos (1832-1907). Bustos modified the Mexican artistic tradition of ex-votos, little images painted in thanks for daily miracles, to accommodate the celestial phenomena. Today his "group portrait" of comets hangs in the Alhóndiga de Granaditas regional museum in Guanajuato, just up the street from Diego Rivera's birthplace.

In the NFL, there are non-playoff teams, playoff teams and the teams that legitimately compete for the title. Elway has said he believes the way to be one of the teams that legitimately competes for a title each and every year is to have a franchise player at quarterback "who can win the biggest games from the pocket — far and away, it's the most important position for a team," and to have a roster surrounding that quarterback that is largely built through the draft.
He said large sports events like the Olympics typically have not had major outbreaks in the past.

In the U.S., people are simply eating out less. At supermarkets, they buy fewer luxury items such as T-bone and New York steaks (about $6.20 a pound) and more of the less expensive and less profitable hamburger ($2.25 a pound).

April 1st is one of my favorite days of the year, a day when being a fool is more forgivable, perhaps, than the rest of the year. This day of pranks, like many other social customs, has its roots in other countries. In this quiz, we’ll check how this custom might have taken hold, although you have to wonder whether the researchers might be pulling our leg. Good luck and you know what they say about fools rushing in....

There are other notable occasions. After Abraham is held back at the last moment from fulfilling God's command to kill Isaac, he and God never speak again.

Nonetheless, he recorded and toured with the Chrome Cranks for several years until that project petered out, and then wound up reuniting with them to play a festival in France for what was supposed to be a one-off performance. “I’ll be honest, there were some good times and we got to tour Europe a bunch and I had some fun with the Chrome Cranks, but overall that was not a great experience for me the first time around. They had recorded tons of stuff with their old drummer that they kept releasing, so it took me years in that band to even get on a record. Then we'd be doing these tours playing empty rooms, promoting these records of demos that nobody was listening to... it got very frustrating at times. But when we got back together for this festival, we were all a lot older and wiser by that point, and it was completely different. So when Peter asked if I’d be interested in getting back together again, I took him up on it.”
“The King’s Speech” occasionally meanders, particularly whenever it leaves those shabby rooms where the king and Logue are hard at work.

As the University of Texas at Austin was becoming a bastion of liberalism, Perry headed to Texas A&M, which was transitioning from an all-male military school, but not from conservatism.

Of course, cooked chicken, fish, meat or cheese can be added to make the salad more of a main-course affair.
