The NBA treats its fans like they really don’t care. I’m personally offended by both the owners and the players’ attitudes through all of this. They play for the fans. ... I think people will go back eventually, but not right away. It’s always about the money. The owners always want more. The players always want more. But when was the last time someone spent money to see an owner score a basket? The owners should realize that.”

Sometimes, the gaps in the text are too big to fill. The power of our objects to conjure us only so strong, even the ones with the power of language. A lot of the time, this is fine. The suggestion of a story can be just as powerful as the complete narrative. But the letters in the crate? Kitson needed to return them — it was more than the archaeologist in him — these letters belonged somewhere else. And to deliver them to the right place, to the right people, he needed the whole story.

It was December 1957. I lived in Slavic Village. I had never seen or tasted a pizza. My boyfriend, who a year later became my husband, came to visit one evening, even though there was a snowstorm raging outside. There was a foot and a half of snow on the street. A pizza place just opened across from St. Stanislaus. "Let's go get one. You can wait in the car while I get it," he said. My boyfriend left the radio on, and there, sitting in his 1956 powder-blue Ford convertible, I heard for the first time, "Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock . . . " I thought it was the best Christmas song around. I still love it. And every Christmas when I am with my grandchildren and hear "Jingle Bell Rock," they hear me say, "I remember the first time I ever heard this song -- and the first time I ever had pizza."

For Murakami, such a statement establishes the stakes of "1Q84," framing it as no mere fantasy but rather a multilayered narrative of loyalty and loss. Such issues have often marked Murakami's fiction, most vividly perhaps in the densely beautiful "Kafka on the Shore" (2005) or the understated stories of 2002's "After the Quake." Yet in both heft and scope, in its sense of metaphysics and of metafiction, "1Q84" takes things several levels deeper, aspiring to more density, more depth of emotion, and for the most part pulling it off.

2. Don't choose a high dollar school if you have your heart set on a low dollar career. In the article, "Aboriginal Art and College Cost Bubbles" (FastWeb.com, December 2011), financial aid expert Mark Kantrowitz, loosely defined a college cost bubble as a disconnect between the cost of tuition and the market value of the degree earned.

These students often borrow excessively to pay for their education, more than they can afford to repay. For them, the cost of the education exceeds its financial value. Education debt is good debt, in that it helps you get a better job, but too much of a good thing can hurt you."

Far more fascinating to me is Koh Panyee island, populated by about 1,500 villagers. It is the Venice of Thailand -- a rickety collection of over-water huts and alarmingly fragile platforms that fan out from a steep limestone monolith. The economy is largely based on tourism, with an open-air mall overflowing with everything from dried fish to bright sarongs and seashells.

They also went out into the city, or "the scene of the crime," as Bron put it. At a meeting of the nonprofit East Side Organizing Project, he met activist Barbara Anderson, who in 1999 almost lost her Slavic Village home to a predatory lender. Anderson fought the mortgage company and won, and now she was helping others. Her anger at the big banks glowed as bright as her red jacket.

The Orioles' bullpen continued to shine, with Darren O'Day and Pedro Strop pitching scoreless eighth and ninth innings, respectively. Strop (3-1) put runners at first and second with one out but escaped the jam, setting the stage for a comeback the next half-inning that injected life into Camden Yards.
"The first four innings were very good," Arrieta said. "and I was on pace to have a very good outing tonight, the pitch count was down. So it's just frustrating that when we put up two runs in the fifth and I am not able to have a shutdown inning and extend my outing even further it's frustrating. Not really for myself but for the team. We get two runs off a guy like Weaver we need to do what we can to win the game."
A single oak tree can generate as many as 6,000 particles of pollen per cubic meter. But if as few as 10 of them fly up someone's nose, the irritating powder can trigger an allergic reaction.

Many communities hold events around the Halloween season. From haunted houses and hayrides to corn mazes and children's parties, it seems there is a Halloween event for every age group. Parents with a child who is nervous or a bit timid about Halloween should research the events they wish to attend prior to going. Is the event more silly or scary? Is there a recommended age group? Doing a bit of homework before the event can help your child enjoy Halloween rather than consider it a frightening time of year.

Cantor has said he will not support what Boehner seems to be considering.
Despite the jaw-dropping price tags on these supermansions, many developers aren't asking nearly what they would have during the market's peak. In Palm Beach, Fla., builder Dan Swanson currently has an $84 million home adjacent to a large nature preserve that's been on the market since May. The project began three years ago, when he tore down two homes on a cul-de-sac and built a 27,000-square-foot house that has parking for more than 50 cars, a 60-foot swimming pool and six juice bars spread across the main and guest quarters. The asking price, he says, could have been more than $100 million several years ago.

If his goal was the easiest path to the most victories on his coaching record, Schiano should have sprinted out of Piscataway a long time ago.

Why 14 Hands? It seems a horse's height is measured in "hands" just as a person's is in "feet." In ancient times traders measured a horse by stacking fists up to its withers, the area just behind its neck. A "hand" is about four inches.
You make a lot of good points, Amanda, but perhaps we should not be so surprised that the race has focused so much on race and gender. Supporters have to distinguish their candidate from the other somehow, and unless you are Paul Krugman, you are probably not going to get wound up over whether Obama's healthcare proposal contains mandates. Clinton and Obama have different personalities and different campaign styles, but on policy (oh, that!), except about Iraq, they are pretty close.

Ironically, Los Angeles has forgotten more about mass transit than most cities will ever know. In 1886, the year of Benz's patent, construction began on the nation's first overhead electric transit line, the Los Angeles Electric Railway, a modest little route that ran through the streets of downtown L.A. A couple of decades hence, Henry Huntington consolidated various transit companies to form the Pacific Electric Railway, which at its peak had more than 1,100 miles of track and 900 of its famous Red Cars serving, in 1944, more than 109 million riders.

He died this past week, at 66, of a heart attack, which has its poignancy, given the palpitations he caused an entire generation of girls. I don't know why his passing saddens me as much as it does. I never mailed him a letter. Never waited for a signed photo. Maybe it's just that whole end of innocence thing. Or maybe that Jones, unlike so many big names today, seemed to really enjoy being a pop star while never acting as if it was a birthright.

Mickelson mastered Augusta with shots like a devilish flop from the back of the green to set up a birdie on the 15th. The 64 degrees of lob wedge, as much Bachi hoe as golf club, doesn't come close to measuring how cool a player must be to even attempt such a shot. There isn't another player on the planet who could pull off that shot under major-championship pressure.

In 1987, a few months before the first intifada, a newsmagazine dispatched Grossman to the West Bank, and he used his fluent Arabic to collect the grievances of occupied Palestinians from all walks of life. The resulting report, "The Yellow Wind," gave public airing to a previously suppressed narrative and forced Israelis to reckon with a slow-burning nightmare of their own creation.

But as fate would have it, I was sporting a first baseman's glove (homage to Ernie) that covered about half of my scrawny right arm and hadn't spent enough time under my mattress to be properly broken in.

The story is much the same for cars: Affluent Chinese car buyers so far shun Chinese cars in favor of blue-chip European or American luxury brands.
