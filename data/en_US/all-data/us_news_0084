The lieutenant colonel probably has some ideas, because he does not want to be blamed if you do not have something, and these go on the packing list for the whole battalion.

First Ben Liebsch pulls out an enemies list and declares war. Then he waves a puke-stained white flag and hops on the treadmill to satisfy his manager. Then he celebrates his birthday in a haze of regrets. After couch-surfing, he gives himself a half-delirious pep talk and wonders what it would be like to get clean. Next he eulogizes James Brown and gives up on his own soul. Only after that does Liebsch — pop-rock’s wildest flamethrower mouth since Max Bemis of Say Anything — turn down the heat a bit.

"My Monday moan is when I visit my primary-care doctor, the pharmaceutical salespersons frequently outnumber the patients in the waiting room. More annoying is when they take the salespersons ahead of the patients, and even more irritating is to see the salesperson giving perks to the office help and hear them giving dinner invitations to the doctor for him and his wife. All this should be done before or after hours. Patients should come first."

The bridge at the center of "Crane Palimpsest" is more than literal. "It's also a metaphor for a bridge that connects two languages," says the composer's father, conductor Jeffrey Kahane, 55, of his son's ability to unite pop idioms with a tradition of chamber music that goes back to Haydn. "You can't call him a crossover artist — he's not crossing from one thing to another. He's completely at home in classical music and in rock music."

The Durneys' original winery facility remains, as does the residence. Vineyard visits are rare, given the windy 6-mile drive into the Cachagua Valley and the twisty mile-long driveway. But visitors to the tasting room would recognize many of the statues made by Toby Heller, originals of which dot the vineyard property. The evocative dancing couple on the Heller labels is based on a 15-foot piece that overlooks the vines.
When he was 9, Hill stopped in a nearby martial arts studio in New York City. He offered to clean in exchange for paying judo class fees.

--- Sam Adams, DT. The offseason before the Ravens won Super Bowl XXXV, they signed Adams to a four-year, $20 million contract and paired him with fellow man mountain Tony Siragusa in the middle of their defensive line.

Biden said "the measure is going to be whether this Arab spring continues to be a spring and grows in democracy. That's why we think, I think, Turkey is such an incredible model.

For most of the past decade, Ford lost money on every vehicle that it sold in the United States, even as its total share of the marketplace slid by almost a third.

Some clients were concerned about how their adult child was spending money and were wondering if it was because they gave him too much when he was growing up. The child was accustomed to a lifestyle that he could no longer afford. Instead of creating a story as to why the child is acting this way, simply acknowledge the behavior. If this person were not your offspring, you would observe his actions and know that at some point there will be consequences for him -- he may get in over his head, he may have to take a second job, he may have to spend less, or he may have to downsize.
Jason La Canfora, NFL Network: "Spagnuolo's Rams were one of three teams to beat the Saints during the 2011 regular season. Spagnuolo's defense in St. Louis ranked 22nd this season, but the unit was stellar against New Orleans, sacking Drew Brees six times and intercepting him twice in the team's most lopsided loss of the season. Before taking over in St. Louis, Spagnuolo had top-10 defenses with the Giants. His 2007 defense led the NFL with 53 sacks, and the 2008 unit was sixth in the league with 42."

The idea for delaying the bridge tolls was simple. Commissioner John Dougherty noticed that the agency had about $27 million in unspent money for economic development projects. Since a $1 toll hike would bring in about $27 million for six months, he figured it was a natural.
Smart shook up the lineup, moving Tyreke Evans from starting point guard to small forward in place of Salmons. Denver coach George Karl said the move that put rookie Isaiah Thomas in the starting lineup brought "common sense" to the Kings' offense.

Dr. Howard Weinblatt's decision to plead no contest to a single count of surveilling an unclothed person must come as an enormous relief to every one of the principals in this bizarrely creepy episode:
And in a statement emailed before Obama's OSU visit, Ohio Republican Party spokesman Chris Maloney said the president's policies are "long on rhetoric and short on actual substance." Maloney called on Obama to urge senior Ohio Sen.

It's simple. Both St. Charles and Jefferson counties have just enough Democrats to scare Republican congressional incumbents Jo Ann Emerson, Todd Akin and Blaine Luetkemeyer.
But some political advisors argue that an election-year epiphany on the issue would be seen as simple political opportunism at a time Obama's campaign is eager to highlight principled decisiveness.

Because, for all his warts, Mark Sanchez is still a pretty good plan. Trading up to select him with the fifth overall pick in the 2009 draft is still one of the bolder and smarter moves this franchise has made.
Written and directed by Murray’s old pal Mitch Glazer (whose spotty credits go back to the original SNL days and “Scrooged”), the movie wobbles between bathetic melodrama and fairy-tale silliness. Rourke looks beaten up even before he is. Murray seems to be deep in a private joke. Fox shows less emotion than a Transformer.

Eyes lit up like a pinball machine, lips moistened and glistening with anticipation, she went on to describe the smooth curves, the water features, the natural-wood structures, the views, the undulating grass, the sculpted pathways -- her voice rising excitedly with each exquisite detail, until in a tremulous climax she uttered the words that sent all of us scurrying for a post-orgasmic bag of cheddar goldfish:

The 37-year-old Campbell — a powerful, ball-playing center-back who played 73 times for his country — called time on his career having failed to find a club following his release from Newcastle at the end of last season.
That means it will soon be time to begin the debate over the fall general election in earnest. It is unlikely that Mr. Romney will be able to reset his campaign entirely, as one of his top aides recently suggested by comparing the general election contest to an Etch-a-Sketch. He will not be able to disavow his efforts to sell himself to a Republican primary audience as "severely conservative." But he will be forced to address himself to a broader audience. We can expect less focus on issues that are of concern to a narrow slice of voters and more on the economy, health care, the national debt, education, the war in Afghanistan and other concerns of the entire electorate.
They tried to please everyone: Greece would get more aid. Bondholder losses would be substantial, to placate the Germans, Dutch and Finns. But as the ECB insisted, they would avoid pushing Greece into selective default.

"As I began to feel the need to volunteer, I knew I was a very, very tiny fish in a huge ocean. Everything was licking envelopes," she says.

Alex Van Halen delivered a drum solo that morphed in and out of perky Afro-Cuban rhythmics. Dave told him he looked like "the Frito tiger.” I think Alex is looking more like Italian cartoon anti-hero RanXerox as he ages, which is to say interesting.
When CKE's health care advisers, citing Obamacare's complexities, opacities and uncertainties, said it would add between $7.3 million and $35.1 million to the company's $12 million health care costs in 2010, Puzder said: I need a number I can plan with. They guessed $18 million -- twice what CKE spent last year building new restaurants. Obamacare must mean fewer restaurants.
Caron Butler (12.0 ppg, 3.7 rpg) brings a healthy dose of playoff experience to the Clippers' starting lineup. After getting off to a hot start this season, Butler settled into a routine of inconsistency, hitting on all cylinders one night and giving the Clippers nothing on offense the next. Butler (12.0, 3.7) will have to be productive on the perimeter if the Clippers are going to win this series.
But longtime fans of Wainwright, whose father is singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III and who grew up with his folk singer mother, Kate McGarrigle, in Montreal, need not despair that this new album will be unrecognizable, the singer said.
That's a good thing, I think. I am so proud of the passengers who subdued the captain of a JetBlue flight this week after the captain had some kind of psychological breakdown and ran screaming down the aisle of the plane.
MLS is still not on the level of the other major league sports, but I believe this soccer thing in Portland ends up a blue ocean. Season-ticket bonanza. Great summer weather coming. Sponsors such as Widmer Brothers Brewing have already angled for stadium exclusivity, paying big dollars to lock out competition. As a result, I'm convinced that ownership and team management understands that its new best customer is not the rowdy in the scarf.
A no-hitter is the kind of rare accomplishment in baseball that fans and players savor (the last time Angels fans witnessed one at home was in 1975, with Nolan Ryan on the mound), but Weaver's accomplishment was soaked with added significance. The 29-year-old Southern California native tossed the best game of his career, against the Minnesota Twins, in front of his parents, Dave and Gail Weaver, and his wife, Kristin, who sit together for Jered's starts, 20 rows behind home plate in section 119 of Angels Stadium.

Shannon Ryan, Chicago Tribune: "Weber's contract runs through 2014-15, which according to USA Today paid $1.5 million last year. The school is paying Zook a $2.6 million buyout and it hired Tim Beckman as a replacement for $9 million over five years. Women's basketball coach Jolette Law also may be on the hot seat. Asked about the financial feasibility of paying out contracts of multiple coaches, Thomas said, ‘You have to be sensitive to that. Is it the primary consideration? I wouldn't say so.'"
Obama said the public doesn't like to see tax dollars wasted, but does want to see money spent in areas that help the country thrive. In Ohio, Obama visited a successful job-training program of the type the White House says would face steep cutbacks in federal financing under the House-passed budget, which Romney supports. And in Michigan, the president will scoop up more campaign cash to help him combat Romney's efforts to frame his presidency as an economic failure.

Mr. Einhorn is a hard-liner, wanting strict accounting standards that punish missteps quickly. Allied Capital, to judge by his version of events, liked living in a more lenient world, where there was plenty of time to patch up problems quietly.

øThe Angels offense won't be held down for long. When the bats start rebounding, Trout will get credit for lighting the spark - whether it's true or not. Another factor in Trout's favor is with Abreu gone, all the Angels in the outfield hit right-handed. So playing time will depend mostly on performance instead of matchups.

The title story features a different sort of fracture, as a girl uses her father's binoculars to spy on the people next door. Only at the end of the story, after a tragedy she didn't witness, does she realize that she has never known her neighbors at all. Even memory is conditional; in "Chance," an adult narrator looks back at the year she was 15, when her parents hosted a Torah study group that was a cover for a weekly poker game. "Did it happen exactly that way?" she asks halfway through the story. "A deck of cards has fifty-two factorial permutations. … Fifty-two factorial is an enormous number. Roughly that many angels dance on any pin. Furthermore, two decades have passed since the night the rabbi's three nines (missing the spade) beat my mother's three fives (missing the diamond) in the first game of the weekly group. I would be wise to distrust my memory."

It slowly transforms Walter from a buttoned-up fogy, hardly more outgoing than Anthony Hopkins's butler in "The Remains of the Day," to an earnest, if unlikely, drummer who joins other musicians in Central Park, and eventually beats out his own white-guy version of African rhythms in the subway. Music also gives Walter a new family -- not just the universal family of pulsing melody, but the flesh-and-blood family of Tarek, who becomes, comically at first, his surrogate son, and the boy's mother, Mouna (an elegantly nuanced performance by Hiam Abbass), who shows up in New York after Tarek falls afoul of immigration authorities.

But all caveats aside, there is one area in which Villaraigosa shines: He really is L.A.'s transportation mayor. By tirelessly advocating for expanding the transit system and helping to spearhead the drive to pass Measure R, the 2008 ballot initiative that raised county sales taxes to pay for a host of key transit improvements, Villaraigosa has presided over a term of unparalleled growth in the city's transit network. So it's not surprising that with just a year left in office, he used his State of the City address to propose an initiative that would put his stamp on L.A.'s transportation system for decades to come.

MESSING: Many persons who do not have proper papers may be entitled to legal status upon application to immigration officials or immigration judges. If the girlfriend has been in the U.S. for a significant period (10 years or more) and comported herself with good moral character, she may qualify for a waiver of illegality based upon a claim of extreme hardship of deportation to her children, or if married, to her husband as well. This can occur despite an admitted illegal prior entry. If she qualifies, the girlfriend could be granted permission to remain in the U.S. by an immigration judge. This is one of the contradictions between the new Arizona law and federal immigration law that is being argued now in the court cases brought to challenge the new law. Someone who may seem to be illegal at first blush may actually be entitled to legal status upon filing a legitimate application.

For those who doubt that the current investment policy is working, they need look no further than the performance of 2011. In the first half of the year, when the markets were on the rise, the investment managers of the fund were criticized because of median-like returns.

The Names of Love (the original French title translates, more aptly, to The Names of People) is a love story, and a farce. It asks us to consider the politics of nationalism, the politics of inclusion, the politics of sex, and the impolitic prejudices that most of us are guilty of harboring.

The next day, his knee was grotesquely swollen. Antibiotics and cleanout surgeries didn't eliminate the problems.

They removed the ACL, plus screws and some bone.

As it goes in the NBA, the Mavericks are still forced to pay Odom the rest of his $8.9 million salary. Which, of course, sounds ridiculous. Charles Barkley, an NBA analyst for TNT, said on "Galloway & Company," a Dallas-Fort Worth radio show: "I always pull for the players, but the fact that they've got to pay him I think is a joke. I mean, because he didn't earn his salary. He didn't earn it at all. I like Lamar as a person, but I'm disappointed about everything that happened in Dallas. And it's a shame that the Mavs got to pay him, to be honest with you, because he doesn't deserve to get paid for what he put out there this year. He doesn't deserve it, plain and simple."
"It's a complex issue," said Philip Dodd, organizer of the Hong Kong art fair's first private museum forum last year.
Since then, all the company's abalone are super reds and Matt Bolton has taken over as the restaurant's executive chef, but the latter still highlights local and seasonal fare on its dinner-only menu. One recent offering: a first course of Monterey Bay farmed abalone, braised in a barigoule of baby artichoke, bacon, tomato, white wine, garlic, coriander and onion, and served with fava bean puree and oven-dried tomato ($25). Although the mollusk might disagree, there's no better way to end your abalone adventure than by dining on an expertly prepared version overlooking the coast where it first gained culinary fame.

Poor posture -- A large amount of acute back pain stems from slouching; which desk jobs are notorious for encouraging. If you find yourself sitting for a large portion of the day, consider taking time to stretch and stand for periods of time. In fact, many workplaces are installing standing work stations for their employees that promote better posture and a healthier back. Also, examine the lumbar support of your furniture. Ergonomic furniture promotes good posture and keeps your spine from leaning too far forward or backward. It is also important that your chair be at a good height for your work surface, so you do not have to slouch or overextend in order to work.

It was an awkward straddle, but as long as the issue was out of the spotlight, the president intended to stick with it. Biden's candor made that impossible. The spectacle of the president and vice president disagreeing got in the way of the Obama campaign's planned rollout this week of its basic economic message. And the issue was going to come up again and again -- at Thursday night's fundraiser at George Clooney's home in Los Angeles, at the Democratic National Convention in September and at lots of events in between. The Obama campaign understands at least one basic rule of politics: When you're in a hole, stop digging and find a way out.

Although the city is now considering bids for just six centers, it ultimately hopes to turn over as many as 31 to private operators. Not as many groups entered the first round of bidding as the Rawlings-Blake administration had hoped, largely because of the level of financial commitment the city expected from the vendors. The administration hopes to modify its request for proposals in an effort to get more qualified bidders, but it would not be in the city's best interests if the prospective vendors made the finances work by increasing reliance on fees.

David Schoenfield, ESPN.com: "Lohse had the best season of his career in 2011, although there was some luck built into it: He allowed a .269 average on balls in play, well below his career mark of .302. There's nothing in the numbers that suggests he was doing something different -- his ground-ball rate matched his career and his line-drive rate was actually 1.1 percent higher than his career mark. Everyone expects some regression in 2012, but his first start was more 2011. No walks on the night and through six he threw a first-pitch strike to 13 of the 18 batters he faced. Hitters should know Lohse will come right after them when the bases are empty. He walked only 10 hitters last season in 469 plate appearances with nobody on; with runners, he walked 32 in 306 plate appearances."
