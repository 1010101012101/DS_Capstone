...which I recognize as coming from a sheet of spooky Halloween stickers meant to be applied to your skin. I purchased it sometime in the late 70s, probably at the neighborhood Super X or TG&Y drug store. I don't remember too much more about it other than each sticker was labeled somewhere on the packaging, and that big gash in the upper left was described as an "Open Wound".

Despite the U.S. Senate’s rejection of cap-and-trade legislation, the carbon-tax agenda is still being implemented in America and around the world. Using the Environmental Protection Agency, the Obama administration is moving forward on regulating emissions of carbon dioxide at the federal level. And through alliances and agreements between states and even foreign governments — unconstitutional under Article 1, Section 10 of the U.S. Constitution — those same forces are building a powerful and expensive carbon regime that could eventually encompass every state in the Union, and beyond.

Go back to the nineteenth century, and it's a bit harder. There are newspapers and magazines - quite a lot of them - and if you're lucky enough to find databases that have them as word-searchable PDFs, you can fillet all mentions of your chosen subject from tons of last century's chip paper within minutes. The trouble is, you know how now, the mainstream press don't write much about beer? Well, they didn't much then, either. For example, over 99.9% of the 16,000 mentions of 'India Pale Ale' in the Burley Collection of 18th and 19th century newspapers are in the classified ads section, and while the first few you look at are very revealing (that's where I discovered the earliest actual mention of 'India Pale Ale' for example) after that, they're all the same.

A disclaimer states the class does not count towards any Stanford credit, grade or qualification. Thrun has resigned from teaching at Stanford (where he is still a part-time research professor). Smitten with the online ability to reach tens of thousands of students as opposed to just hundreds at university, he hopes never to teach a lecture-style class again. His new venture is Udacity, a 20-person free online education start-up funded by venture capital. More than 130,000 people signed up for the first two courses in January – building a robotic car and a web-search engine.

Simon Frankel, an American jeweler, bought the Hope diamond in 1901 and brought the diamond to the United States. The diamond changed hands several times during the next several years, ending with Pierre Cartier. Pierre Cartier believed he had found a buyer in the rich Evalyn Walsh McLean. Evalyn first saw the Hope diamond in 1910 while visiting Paris with her husband. Since Mrs. McLean had previously told Pierre Cartier that objects usually considered bad luck turned into good luck for her, Cartier made sure to emphasize the Hope diamond's negative history. Yet, since Mrs. McLean did not like the diamond in its current mounting, she didn't buy it.
This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to see the abortion industry shut down. Rhetoric and talking points won't do it. Politicians can't do it. The only way this will happen is to change hearts and minds one person at a time, through love, compassion, gentleness and understanding.

Last summer I was jogging trying to lean into an image of myself that would be fit, healthy, vital. Then in October the balance stuff started. And it has been a struggle to not see myself through the lens of someone who is unwell in some way. I finally came to the self dx of disembarkment syndrome (Mal de Debarquement Syndrome) and that has really helped me, because it is self limiting, not progressive, and doesn't effect lifespan or anything. But still on a bad day when I try to do something regular, like walk up a small incline, use a public restroom, get out of the car, scrub anything, and I end up feeling like I am ninety, my mindset tends to suffer. So it will take time for me to get used to this and all the minor adjustments I need to make; to be prepared for feeling wonky, but not to expect it.

In fairness my lack of blogs updates is also due to a rather hectic time at work and the fact that I really haven't got into a good routine of early nights to match the pre 6am mornings which I need to be able to get up, cycle, shower, make-up and breakfast in time.
Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak has NOT “lived up to expectations”, nor is it his duty to ‘put forward more opening strategies’. Rather it is the 2nd Finance Minister (why is the PM holding so many Ministries??? Conflict of interest anyone???) who has done the former and has to do the latter.
In medium saucepan combine cornmeal, water and milk. Whisk together continuously while bringing to a simmer. Add a generous amount of salt, cover and let cook for about 15-20 minutes or until the cornmeal becomes thick, the liquid is all absorbed and the cornmeal is tender, whisking occasionally. Once cooked stir in the butter, check for seasoning and add more salt if needed. Pour into a buttered 8×8 pan and cover with plastic wrap (to avoid a crust from forming on top). Cool completely and refridgerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 24.

I like it a lot and will not likely grow it back out anytime soon.

Every week on Wednesdays I tutor a nine-year-old boy named Daniel. He goes to a private school and must wear a uniform every day. He lives with his mom, dad and younger brother Gonzalo in an apartment in Nervion. I remember one of the first times I went to the apartment, I was pleasantly greeted by a heated environment, contrary to the cold that occupied my room. At school he learns math, science and literature in English as well as taking other classes in Spanish and a Castellan language class. When I first met with his parents, they told me that the biggest difficulty for Daniel with English was pronunciation. Therefore I aimed to help him with his pronunciation and listening when we worked on prepositions, vocabulary, numbers and the alphabet. He is very obedient but at times he knows that he can get away with things in his house so he won’t hesitate to disagree with his parents or me. Often times he has worksheets to do as homework so whatever the topic of the worksheet is dictates what we work on for the rest of the time. For example, if the week’s topic is using the words “can” and “can’t,” Daniel would draw pictures and then write a sentence about the picture using “can” and “can’t.” I have always loved working with kids because they have so much energy. Daniel’s favorite game is called 21. As we toss a stuffed soccer ball back and forth, we count up to 21, picking between saying one number or two numbers. Whoever says 21 loses; then the game starts over again. Almost every Wednesday I count to 21 for half an hour. Tutoring Daniel also gives me a view into family life of those with younger kids. Loli’s grandchildren come over but interactions between grandparents and grandchildren are very different from those between parents and children. Also I’m exposed to a different economic class as Daniel’s family pertains to middle or upper class.

And I realized that everything I knew about taking care of children and raising kids came from my parents, my mom. So, as I try to take care of my baby brother (and sometimes my baby sister) I am trying to do the things I saw and felt my mom do to me. And if I try to suggest something to my mom, try to offer solutions to issues I see, or try to discuss problems...I am not attacking my mom and the way she does things. Just trying to be a good mom, which I learned from her. I don't want to take her place as mom to my brother. I just want to help him be happy, help him through a hard time in life. And I am finding my relationship with him is changing, improving.

We drive along the sand track which in places marks the end of the fire. Black as pitch the soot covers the charred view. Elephants have left big round impressions of footprints, where they have crossed out of the fire zone and into the bright blonde grasses again. Here and there a fallen tree continues to burn. At night the coals still glow red but during the day they hide in snow white ash. Trees that burnt where they fell, have left a ghostly impression in ash on the ground. We are driving past funeral pyres for trees - there is an armageddon feel as if we have stumbled onto the battlefield after a ghastly war. The stump of an ancient leadwood tree shines dazzling white against the black. Cascading pure white ash it is a tower of smouldering coals around the baked ceramic core of the termitaria which once shared its niche. Soon all trace of its existence will be blown away in the wind.

As writers, this should be a given. Words are powerful tools, so it’s important and necessary to be as flawless in the use of them as you can be. When applied to the craft of writing, it means writing clear, concise, and relevant content and proofing and editing your work. If you’re not good at editing, consider working with someone who can do it for you. This is especially true when it comes to proposals and work agreements. Taking care to specify the details such as timelines, deliverables, fees, and payment schedules before you begin working can eliminate problems and keep the project on target. When it comes to words, the goal should always be perfection.

“From Ancient to Modern: the Tradition of the Colombe in the Rosicrucian Order.” This presentation will explore the ancient traditions and symbolism behind the role of Colombe within the Rosicrucian Order AMORC, and how this mystical tradition has evolved over the centuries. The benefits derived for the individuals fortunate to grow up in the studies of esotericism and mysticism will also be examined.
Not only that: since Kenneth Clarke was Chancellor in 1994, tobacco taxes have specifically been ring fenced to pay for the NHS via the Department of Health.

Unlike the other homes and families we had visited, Comilla’s home was very small and made of mud and straw. There was no fan or chairs or bed or clothes lying around. There was only a bed of straw laid out on a raised pile of wooden logs. A few steps away a few utensils lay on the floor next to a traditional stove. This was her kitchen. As we walked towards her home, Comilla smiled in excitement as tears rolled down her face. The neighbours brought us chairs from their homes, we seated a reluctant Comilla on one, as she kept insisting all the while that we sit on them. We asked her why her eyes welled up. She said that she felt fortunate that we had visited her humble home, apologizing for how small it was. We told her that we were grateful that she welcomed us and was willing to share her story. We truly were grateful, for the story that followed is not an easy one to share with strangers who belong to a culture, one that may never be able to fully grasp the realities of her own.

In addition to developing an evaluation process, it is important to evaluate who are the “best qualified” vendors in each of the Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM) stages (information management, identification, preservation, collection, and processing with review and production, and trial) for which you need vendor services.

Still, she thought, uncooth, small, twisted little people from the swamp rising to such prominence while she had remained at Shiz University until she'd finished her Master of Arcane Studies and had been called into service by the buffoon Scarecrow. And now, the buffoon was coming back. He wanted his throne - as if it was his to begin with. Oz - had he been truly brilliant and knowledgeable, he would have known - had never been ruled by the wise or even the righteous. It was ruled by the person who wanted it the most, the person with the willingness to step forward and claim it. The people of Oz were, as always, apathetic at best, easily cowed, easily wowed, not ready for the test of a would-be monarch. Never were there wars or battle, no armies marching, no people demonstrating in the streets of the Emerald City for rights, picking fights, instead seeing the sights, not in for frights. They wanted to be left alone, which left the door open for the regent that wanted the throne more than the last one.
His eyes had sunk deep into his face, with dark purple rings surrounding them. His cheekbones were clearly defined, but sallow and pale. There were flecks of grey and ginger in his beard and his, now shoulder-length, hair was tangled into so many knots he considered simply hacking it off. His only redeeming feature was his broad shoulders and he only had good genes to thank for those.
High stakes stories should push the boundaries and the highest stakes are both personal and public. I’m interested in the price of victory. I’m not really convinced by stories where you know that no harm will really be done to any of the key characters, no matter what. I want to keep the reader on the edge of their seat and deeply anxious. Remember I am writing horror, but the horror isn’t just monsters, but the choices the characters must make. If the reader feels Billi’s pain deep in their guts, then I’ve done my job.

This is more worrying than the poll ratings for a number of reasons. This is not least because it says that those who understand the party the most, those who believe in the values of the party, those who realise that compromise is necessary more than most are the ones who are disillusioned and that this is having a practical impact on the ground. If we are to go back to basic principles of politics we can make an assessment of where we are now. To be successful in politics we need to do the following:

Nonfiction is sold on the basis of a book proposal. I've written lots and lots about proposals; I won't get into it here except to say that even if your whole manuscript is complete, you STILL need to show a proposal first. It contains information that's not in a manuscript, such as your target audience, your marketing plans, an analysis of competing books, your qualifications, etc. Some agents will look at a book proposal unsolicited, but most prefer that you first submit a query letter the summarizes it first, then if they give you the go-ahead, you submit the proposal.

What I do think, though, after spending nearly a year doing research that is as forensic and detailed as I can possibly do on the history of coaching inns, pubs in general and one pub in particular, is that some who are interested in the history of beer are in danger of strangling the study of it by imposing standards that are too strict, that are tighter than any proper academic historian would insist upon.

My boyfriend. (I really hope he doesn't mind me talking about him but he has become a big part of my life). He didn't just pop up out of nowhere. He was always there. We went to middle school and high school together. We never really hung out with the same crowd but it seems as though God put him on this Earth for me, to be there for me when I needed him. I had been sick for almost 2 years when he showed back up into my life. I was just in the middle of trying to be ok with the fact that it would be hard for me to find someone that was going to be ok with what I had been through and was still going through. And then there he was, totally ok with it, willing to be there for me through absolutely anything. Now, you can not tell me that he wasn't heaven sent. I was watching the movie A Walk to Remember the other night and it's about a girl who falls in love with someone totally unexpected but is also battling leukemia. Even though I have seen this movie numerous times, I had not seen it since I have been with my boyfriend. The story hit very, very close to home. She mentions at one point in the movie that maybe God had given her a plan much bigger that she could imagine. That maybe He sent the person she fell in love with to help her through a difficult time. To be her angel. Well, my boyfriend is my angel.

Nope, NASA doesn't have to worry about me asking to hitch a ride. As much as I've written about my fascination with space, I'm perfectly content to stare up into the night sky and smile at the moon.

Looking up at a full moon, I still feel that childlike awe that men actually walked on it's surface.
The second meaning has to do with the way I approach cycling safety. The readers of this blog have been bludgeoned with numbers. Some to prove a point, some to dispute someone else’s point.

A former professor of mine once exclaimed that he did not like travel. Student reaction was quite negative. The students who liked this professor then felt a need to defend him; interestingly, their defense wasn’t that it is okay to dislike travel, but that he misspoke, that he didn’t really mean that he disliked travel. This is reflective of a larger and unfair stigma against disliking travel. I say unfair since while most people love the idea of travel, traveling itself is much less pleasant for them for a variety of reasons I’ll explore in this post.

Favorite New Hampshire Restaurant: I don't dine enough in New Hampshire and that should change as there are a number of worthy spots throughout the state. This year, I was most impressed with Lobster Q, located in Hampstead, which offers seafood and barbecue. Their clam chowder was superb, the fried clams quite a delight and the ribs were compelling. Much of their food is made from scratch, including their barbecue sauces, and the quality elevates this place above many similar places. So if you are in southern New Hampshire, why not make a stop here for lunch or dinner.

This year we received a month-long subscription to Time 4 Learning's Preschool Curriculum. H4 was so excited to have a website dedicated just for her use.

As a matter of fact she really didn't need help as this site was actually too easy for her. Luckily though there are two different levels of the T4L Preschool and one is slightly harder which was closer to the level that H4 is at.

The current legal and political battle between Optus and major sporting bodies is based on an exception introduced into the Copyright Act in 2006 to allow for private use of copyright content presumed to do no commercial harm. That exception was intended to legitimise the widespread practice of ‘time-shifting’: recording television programs to watch at a more convenient time.
Since when does finding someone who loves you become a “game” and since when does finding someone you love become “strategizing?” If you ask me, that takes all of the natural romantic process out of it and you might well label it another “professional endeavor.” Even to say “romantic strategy” or “romantic games” sounds oxymoronic to me.

I was thrilled to find these still in flower in my garden a couple of weeks back, usually I'd have to wait till spring to see them but our winter here in Dunedin has been relatively mild so far, but as the old saying goes "as the days grow longer, the cold grows stronger" and we often find that this is the case.

The podcast changes to an interview type listen, where Ricky and Steve ask questions and Karl answers. When Karl says something, like how things in the house are constantly breaking, you will notice Ricky and Steve will always question what Karl has done wrong before they ask if what happens is a result of something someone else has done. This is done purposely to wind Karl up, as they know and the listeners know how defensive and grumpy Karl will get and that when he gets wound up, he'll come out with some of his best quotes or arguments.
Ga Young can’t sleep that night and heads out, going to see Young Gul at Young Young. He meanwhile is having the same trouble and slips onto her sleeping bed, unable to relax at all.When he heads back into his office, he imagines Ga Young sleeping on the sofa. Finally, he takes to drinking but even that is no help since he keeps imagining her everywhere. He heads out so that when Ga Young arrives, he’s not there. He’s gone to see his designer friend (Now WHAT was your name?! *Thinking* Argh, can’t remember! Let’s just go without it!) Alright so his friend takes out his frustrations on him and points out Young Gul has changed-not everything is money money money for him anymore and he’s also let go of ‘his woman’, calling it a pity. But Young Gul tells him it’s not his style to stop a woman who wants to leave. Did you even consider the possibility you were the one who made her wanna leave? Anyway, Young Gul has bigger worries on his mind-actually its bigger plans, but I think they’d transform into worries in little time! Basically, what he wants is to transform ‘Dongdaemoon’ into a fashion mecca.
This future is only within reach because of our men and women in uniform. Time and again, they have answered the call to serve in distant and dangerous places. In an age when so many institutions have come up short, these Americans stood tall. They met their responsibilities to one another, and to the flag they serve under. I just met with some of them and told them that as Commander-in-Chief, I could not be prouder. And in their faces, we see what is best in ourselves and our country.
He laughed and went on his way after posing for a picture with Chef Pallardy and his wife and MY wife. I took the picture, but I don't need my picture with him. Michael Symon is a totally nice dude. I could drink with him more often. I'm sure he has some great stories.
I try to think back to an occasion or time in my life that it was of benefit for me to have worried or to have been fearful of the future. I can’t come up with anything. Of course it is our human nature, primal instinct, maybe even a survival mechanism? I suppose it is appropriate to be “worried” about a tornado during a tornado warning, or sharks in shark infested waters. It’s when we mull over things in our minds, imagining and fretting about all of the “what ifs” and worse case scenarios as they relate to instances and situations in our lives and the lives of our loved ones. I can only describe that type of worry as self-induced misery. When we are so used to that way of thinking it is almost impossible to let go of that worry. By letting go of it, we somehow feel out of control. But are we really in control any way?
Warm the milk on the stove or in the microwave to 100 degrees--I used a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature. Cool the warmed milk for a minute, then add the yeast and stir to dissolve. Set aside for about fifteen minutes; it should begin to foam.

Zlý Časy is one of the pubs in Prague that beer lovers recommend. It used to have most beer taps in the Czech capital, but 24 taps are nonetheless impressing. Zlý Časy is found on Čestmírova street next to Náměstí Bratří Synků. It is easy to get there by taking tram number 11 from the city centre.

Indeed, it doesn't stop there, as came out during the programme most if not all of those white boys who did feature in the figures, were not members of gangs of white rapists, but the minority white members of mixed race or primarily black gangs, such as the single white boy amongst the mostly black gang who poured caustic soda on their victim, in the well publicised Tottenham gang rape last year.
There was, however, a point in time immediately after Nora’s birth that was momentarily terrifying. Nora’s heart rate dropped. It was low. Low to the point that they whisked her away from me. We’d thought we’d lost her. My dear friend Kate R. who was present at the birth writes about it in her Letter to Nora. Her description of this experience further validates the absolute miracle that Nora REALLY, TRULY IS!! I now hand the mic over to Kate:

The £10,000 Caine award, known as the African Booker, is for a short story by an African writer published in English and is backed by the African Nobel prize winners Nadine Gordimer, Wole Soyinke, Chinua Achebe and JM Coetzee, with Booker winner Ben Okri as its new vice president. Novelist Bernadine Evaristo, chair of this year's judging panel, set out to find a shortlist of stories which "enlarge our concept" of Africa beyond the images which dominate the media – "War-torn Africa, Starving Africa, Corrupt Africa – in short: The Tragic Continent". She and her fellow judges found five tales which fulfilled her criteria: Nigerian Rotimi Babatunde's Bombay's Republic, Kenyan Billy Kahora's Urban Zoning, Malawian Stanley Kenani's Love on Trial, Zimbabwean Melissa Tandiwe Myambo's La Salle de Départ and South African Constance Myburgh's Hunter Emmanuel.

I had the privilege recently of screening the original “Wizard of Oz” with an audience of nostalgic adults and their soon-to-be-traumatized offspring. (Remember the flying monkeys? ‘Nuff said). I myself was child-free for the afternoon, which allowed me to sink completely into the Technicolor extravaganza that is the film, heightened to an almost painful intensity by Judy Garland and her wide-eyed golly gee willikers schtick.

Please heed this man’s wisdom. Acknowledge that just because a gaming console or PC gives you the anonymity to be an avatar or portray someone else it doesn’t give you free reign to abuse your fellow gamer. Griefing is a form of cyber-bullying and it’s been happening now for far too long. There are far too many children and adults plagued by these anonymous discriminatory actions not to do anything. To joke around in a group of close friends may seem acceptable, but to do so spitefully and rudely on an open forum like a gaming site or server can cause detrimental damage to the receiver. Please think about your actions and, when all is said and done, it’s almost best to say nothing than to say anything at all.

Keeping millions of disabled people inactive and dependent is costly, from a financial and moral point of view. I have witnessed disabled people raise families, work or simply be more cost-effective by keeping healthy and taking greater control over their personal care. It’s not been perfect. But by many standards, we were ahead of the game compared with much of Europe.

Jesus was also reestablishing a profound fact – the importance of the family, which is the first institution on earth, the basic unit of society. The first time, God says it is not good was when he saw man without a helper and made him a family, by creating a woman (help mate) out of man. The family in Heaven is God, the Father, Jesus, the Son and His Holy Spirit, the Helper.

I think sending real, paper Christmas Cards is one of the best parts of the season. I love it when cards from friends and family members start showing up in my mailbox. And Shutterfly makes the process so easy, even if you're crazy busy like we are, you have time to send out beautiful cards to commemorate the year.

I’m feeling really good lately. Las Vegas was a blast! We visited Ben’s family and had a wonderful night laughing with each other and I love his family and I love getting to know them more every time I see them. We got a great hotel room overlooking the strip and the beautiful Bellagio fountain. We had our own show every hour to watch! I loved it. We went to the Mandalay Bay shark reef aquarium and saw some really amazing fish, sharks, jellyfish, you name it. We both were really into it:) We walked around the strip and saw lots of interesting sights and people and shops. On Saturday night we went to the ball and had a really nice time. I love seeing all the Marines in their dress blues uniform, and all the girls dressed up. We ate and drank and cracked jokes and even danced a little bit. It was lovely.
This sounded weird at first insight. Chinese emperors had absolute political in their hands. Why do they have to share their power, then?
I recently bought two gorgeous pairs of boots. For someone with my monstrous sized calves, finding the perfect boot is not easy, let alone finding two of them. Trouble is that the boots need a skinny jean or skirt. I have skirts, no problem. Skinny jeans on the other hand = big problem. Turns out this body was not designed for a skinny jean. The lack of hip and the muscular calves just don’t make for a pretty skinny jean. So I have…gulp…have been downgraded to a jegging. A very classy nice jegging that looks great with the boots. But alas, the boots are sitting in the closet getting dusty. Why? Because I can’t find enough courage to wear the jegging.
This is the fourth law of karma, each action in your life feeds one of the wolves, your ignorance about which wolf is getting fed does not change it, your illusions about which wolf is getting fed does not change it. Like muscle memory, the act of feeding one wolf more often then the other becomes habit. Do you think that your life is kept more interesting by tossing the bad wolf the occasional bone? Do you think that every bone has to be intentional? As we grow older, we throw more and more bones out of habit. Yet the results of these actions stand.

Today is Cinco De Mayo, a holiday that really doesn't mean anything to me. I've been in Texas during Cinco De Mayo, where it is colorful, noisy and fun, especially if you like to drink, sorta like the Irish try to make every holiday. Yet it has never really caught on among we ole New England Yankees, outside of the Spanish ghettos in Springfield and Holyoke. The only evidence of the holiday I could see in Northampton were these painter's pictures that had a sorta Spanish theme.
Today I did get out. The first chore was to harvest most of the radishes. They were all getting big. I took out all the French Breakfast but left just the White Icicle. I figured I'd plant beans around them. As you can see not many radishes are left. Just a small amount.

But it’s also because I value my anonymity. Firstly, obviously, I am currently writing an anonymous, mildly bitchy blog. I think, as it develops, this blog is getting less bitchy (though Bunny did wind me up last Friday tweeting incessantly that “This time next year I’ll be walking down the aisle”, “This time next year I’ll have a ring on my finger”, “This time next year I’ll be better than you!”), but I still like writing to the world at large rather than a familiar readership. It allows certain freedoms from self-censorship that wouldn’t be possible if everyone I knew was checking in.

We left off with our tapes now dumped onto the computer. This is usually the fun part. Overdubbing this and that, extra percussions, noises, and experimenting. We barely got that far. To save time we were now working in both Studio A and Studio B (Joe's bedroom). I would be working on vocals in A while he was doing some editing in his room and when we got bored of the scenery we would switch. It wasn't long before the cat was out of the bag; Joe and I both had reservations about the recordings. He thought this was too slow and I thought that was too fast and we both agreed that this other one just didn't feel right at all. We sat and stared at one another stroking our mustaches for few tense minutes before dropping the guillotine. We would have to re-record.

Not too long ago, I couldn’t say exactly when because it’s been a gradual process, there’s this new thing where people share a picture. But it’s not really a picture because it’s words; just in a graphic form. Usually it’s some kind of “funny” saying (I put that in quotes because, to me, they are rarely amusing) or inspirational claptrap. But other people like them, so it gets shared. Or someone else finds the original and shares it again. Over and over and over until all I can see is a stream of crap that I have no interest in.

Flash forward until sometime last spring, when the MadFermentationist did a white peach beer that he said turned out quite well. After a couple quick back and forth comments, it got me wondering if it wasn't so much peach beers but "clean" peach beers that wouldn't work. Maybe there was something to a sour that could make the peach flavor shine? (I should note Mike also suggests using white peaches, not yellow)

The plot is remarkably similar to the 1932 original. An ancient Egyptian has the hots for a woman destined to be given to the main Egyptian god. Being the devout sort of guy who does not want to tick off the powers that be, he lets his love go until after her death because he thinks her obligation will have ended by then. ‘til death do we part and all that good stuff. It turns out he is wrong. When he is caught in her tomb trying to bring her back to life, he is buried alive to serve as her protector for all eternity.

Here’s the thing. When you’re used to being a people pleaser/doormat in your daily life, this is how you show up in romantic relationships. I can tell you with 100% certainty that this is a huge turn off for men. A man (i.e. a man who will honour you) wants to be with a Love Goddess, and a Love Goddess is a woman who is able to say NO from a place of love because she has learned to love herself (not in a narcissistic way) but in a “I am worthy” kind of way. A Love Goddess attends to her needs and her dreams first because once she’s happy and fulfilled, she has so much more to give to others.
The nitty-gritty of Steven's stories mostly involve a series of characters vying for dominance in their particular field of interest. Whether it be music, the world of self-help, or selling Amway (renamed here as "Allway"), an outsider, usually from the northern part of the continent, emerges at "the top," only to end up dying violently when all is said and done. What happens to them on their way to this bloody demise is a mystery, as Steven has no clue how to write it.
Specifically, the power of a firearm is determined by both its chambering (the designation of the cartridge, generally signifying it's diameter and overall length), and the specific loading of that chambering (the amount and type of powder used in the cartridge, and the weight of the bullet used, both of which can variables in a single chambering).

This show was very much a thrash driven event, and although the fans came to see Zygoatsis and Unholy Grave, it was indeed the thrash bands that made up the meat of the gig. I would like to have seen Nuclear Warfare play to be honest, as their brand of high octane thrash (think the style of Sodom meets Bay Area, but with the onstage energy of Municipal Waste) would have just made this good show, great. But it’s a tiny gripe, and to be fair the members of the band were all in the crowd loving it as fans, so it was all good.
“In East Asian cultures, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean the equinoxes are taken to be the mid-season points of Spring and Fall, as calculated by the 24 solar divisions of the calendar year. “Equal” in this context, represented by the Chinese character 分, is equidistant between the beginning and end of either the Spring or Fall season. In Japan the March or Vernal Equinox is a national holiday, a day for family and visiting ancestors at their graves.”

December 25th was the Winter Solistice for some European pagan groups many years ago. Then the holiday became “Christianized” and it became a celebration of Christ’s birth. I do not like the idea of celebrating pagan holidays. But that is not what I am doing when I celebrate Christmas. I do not observe any pagan deities or observances. Maybe some things in Christmas do come from a pagan influence, especially the tree, but who knows how much of English culture was shaped by pagan roots? Does that mean we need to go on a witch hunt through our culture trying to figure out what is pagan and what is not? No, these things hold no power over me. If they were every used for paganism I will use them for the opposite of what they were intended for. As Martin Luther once said, ““The best way to drive out the devil, if he will not yield to texts of Scripture, is to jeer and flout him for he cannot bear scorn.”

I don’t know if an ice cream store can actually stalk someone, but it sure as hell feels like Baskin Robbins is stalking my family. The three of us walked out of Auntie Pasto’s; Lynnette and I waddled out of the restaurant completely full. There was a random egg – without its shell – sitting on the sidewalk and Madison was fascinated with it. She edged up to it and leaned over, pointing at it. “What happened?” she asked. I was about to make up another one of my legendary fake stories when I looked up and saw the Baskin Robbins storefront. “When did that get here?” I asked Lynnette. “I don’t know,” she said.

Most mornings, after I get up at 6:30 and wake the boys, prod Jake to get ready, make breakfast for John, and close the door behind the three of them, I go back to bed for an early morning nap. I try not to feel guilty about this, because I work hard all day long, and while my work day might start later than some people’s, it also goes on longer (for example, I was drafting motions and writing client letters after 11 last night).

Burtynsky says that he is more interested in showing these human-made landscapes than he is in moralizing or politicizing them, and when the film likewise concentrates on the images, it's at its best. But when it relies too heavily on Burtynsky's narrative or on the human cost of Chinese expansion and Western consumerism (such as in a late segment on land ownership in Shanghai), it feels as if the filmmakers are beating the message home. Burtynsky's images can speak for themselves, and Landscapes will probably make you think long and hard about the next iron you buy, or what happens to your laptop after you discard it.
Thanks, everybody!
But after reading this chapter, I realized what an ungrateful child I am. I live in a house; I get meals cooked for me; I have my own bedroom, closet, and bathroom; I have a working car; I have no outstanding school loans, and I have minimal expenses. And instead of being grateful that the Lord has arranged a comfortable living situation for me, I want more.
Someone cynical might ask, “Aren’t there already used bras in Africa? Why collect used bras from Americans and then ship them overseas?” Even Free the Girls notes on Twitter that there is already a market for secondhand bras in Mozambique where they operate. In that case, instead of flooding the market with more used bras from America, and since Free the Girls clearly has an interest in supporting local entrepreneurs, why not raise money to buy used bras locally and create some miracle growth for local businesses while empowering women with economic opportunity?

Providers follow guidelines. Medical doctors have guidelines on how many and how often to give pills. People respond differently and dosages have to be adjusted. I set plans following research as a guideline for how often and how long to see a patient but modify for individual need. In my office my average new patient face time is 25 min, and for patients established in a treatment plan I average about 12 min. I see a patient about 12 times for an single complaint. Some less and some more. A patient’s time in the office does not always correlate to the amount of face time with me. A visit may be from 10-60 min depending on what other therapies are prescribed for their treatment. The important thing to me is that patients feel like our goals were achieved in their time in my office.

you are a successful trader, speculator, investor, money manager, and is typical have little patience. Something has been bothering you. You have been reading Zero Hedge long enough that you are now absolutely convinced that TEOTWAWKI is indeed nigh, and it could well be quite violent. You have also decided that you want to do something to prepare, beyond getting short the equity markets and going long gold and silver coins, but you do not know what to do, exactly. The HELP function on your Bloomberg terminal is, unsurprisingly, not helpful. A quick review of the government and Red Cross emergency preparedness websites tells you nothing about guns. This is problematic as you fear that we all might be returning to a time in history where it is a common occurrence to fight for one's life, and you know that we usually do that in today's day and age with guns, or a knife close in.

Remember the book The Thorn Birds? The very famous quote goes "There's a story... a legend, about a bird that sings just once in its life. From the moment it leaves its nest, it searches for a thorn tree... and never rests until it's found one. And then it sings... more sweetly than any other creature on the face of the earth. And singing, it impales itself on the longest, sharpest thorn. But, as it dies, it rises above its own agony, to out sing the lark and the nightingale. The thorn bird pays its life for just one song, but the whole world stills to listen, and God in his heaven smiles. For the best is bought, only at the price of great pain."

The spa is incredibly cheap by American standards so I wanted to get another treatment done too. I was scared of getting a massage because how rough they are so I was reading the list of other procedures; one was a Rose Hip Bath.

No thanks, last time I checked my womb was pretty clean. So I just hung out in the baths until it was time to meet up.

I’m a parent of a 10 year old, a published children’s book author, and I grew up in and around libraries…working as a library page at my hometown library in Falls Church, VA, and at various libraries in college. I love to browse and hang out in the children’s rooms, to watch how kids and their parents interact with books, and to work surrounded by “the canon” of authors who have gone before me. I’m baffled and sad that a library would decide that a huge segment of their patrons are assumed to be dangerous to their youngest patrons. The reasoning seems to be that if you don’t have a child in tow, you can have no legitimate, innocent reason for being in a children’s section of a library. If we’re trending toward a society in which the only people with access to minor children are their parents, teachers, and caregivers, everyone loses, potentially the kids most of all. — Ann Downer
Yeah, not so much.
1) First, it is an intense story about a serious situation. I know this sounds kind of basic, but let's face it. I'm normally all about fantasy and science-fiction. So if I say that THE BREAKAWAY is realistic fiction, that doesn't quite seem to cover it. It's about a kidnapping and the time of captivity.
I have worked very hard to achieve a reputation for sincerity, honesty and trustworthiness and I hope this little attempt at an April Fool's prank that backfired does not permanently besmirch my name. I hope that my readers will forgive me and not judge me too harshly for this misstep and I promise in return that nothing like this will ever happen again. I pledge that this modest blog will once again return to its serious mission to enlighten and inform and will leave the practical jokes and sophomoric humor behind. On that you have my word.
The next man in Denise’s life is popular radio disc jockey John Murray (Bruce Davison) who becomes smitten with her and uses his show to promote a controversial song she wrote. He’s a nice enough guy and seems like the one she should be with instead of the pretentious Howard; it’s just too bad that he’s married. During the course of the film, Anders also shows the rivalry between fellow female songwriters, like when Joel brings Cheryl Steed (Patsy Kensit) in to write hit songs and Denise immediately sees her as direct competition. Cheryl even gets a better office then Denise who has been there longer. Cheryl quickly becomes Joel’s new favorite songwriter, much to Denise’s dismay but she puts on a brave face in public.
I have a sense that many professors are struggling to teach the current job skills. NMSU was always good about bringing in talented adjunct professors who maybe didn’t have a master’s degree but were actually out there working on a day-to-day basis. So, in this day and age, j-schools need to make sure they’re bringing in people like me to teach students.

- The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. This is a special mention because I think both film versions (the original Swedish and the recent David Fincher "American" version) are better than the book. This is a rare case where the novel had a great story, but it was weighed down by hundreds of pages of needless backstory, which the movies cut out and effectively cleaned up the plot by doing so.
Ah, the problem of kummel rises again. What to do when a recipe calls for a liqueur I don't have and can't get easily. In the past, I have followed Erik Ellestad's example and just substituted aquavit and a bit of simple syrup. But on this occasion after talking to my friend Dayne, he told me that I should use Benedictine in place of the syrup to get closer to the actual flavor of kummel. Because I have never tasted kummel I have no idea how well this worked, but this little tipple was delicious. The flavors were herbal and complex. A certain sweetness was present, but the dryness of the champagne and the bitters provided balance. Because of the sugar-lining a certain amount of sugar puddled in the bottom of the glass, which caused bubbles to continuously rise through the glass as a result of each sip. The effect is much like what happens when you add the sugar cube when making a champagne cocktail. The Imperial Cossack Crusta was a very surprising cocktail that we will definitely revisit in the future.

I thought I would find everything snapped up and reserved as usual. (Her stuff is awesome and goes quick) I was surprised to find she had a lot of Dream Sleeves up for grabs, I was even more surprised to find there was a Dryad Dream Coat in my size in colors I liked up for grabs. The name of the coat is Potions Class and the colors are all reds, oranges, and purples and I was instantly in love. I must have looked at it a million times in one minute. I quickly logged in to Etsy and after some frantic password resets I saw it was still for grabs. So I called in Husbandman and told him that the shop owner usually allowed for paying in installments could I do it? (Her coats are kinds pricey, but worth it) To my SURPRISE he told me to just pay for it outright!!
Dad.” Her voice was choked; he could hear the barely suppressed tears. He wanted to tell her not to cry, that everything was all right. But then the thought faded, borne away into the analgesic ocean. Reality was ever more distant. A small part of him felt faintly that he perhaps ought to be concerned about this, but he was too detached to follow that idea. What remained was the touch of his daughter’s hand holding his, caressing it. In the background, her voice. She was talking but it was too strenuous to listen to the sense of what she was saying. The awareness of her presence was enough.

The crumb cake card stock was a terrific base with which to use the blender pen. I colored in the large flowers with a Calypso Coral marker then came back and partially outlined the petals with Riding Hood Red. Then I used the blender pen to blend the colors.

Countless times, I’d encounter commenters asking, “I thought this was a parenting blog! Why are you always talking about this race stuff?” For a parent of color, navigating race and racism is a parenting issue. Already, as one of the few Asian Americans at her school, my six-year-old has come home asking me why classmates insist she’s Chinese or ask her where she’s really from. And I know that it will be far too easy for my smart, personable girl who also happens to be really shy in large groups and with authority figures to get lost in the stereotype of the quiet Asian girl, and that it’s my job to monitor, teach, and intervene.

I think very few teachers will admit they aren’t, but look at it this way, if we know, we don’t want to admit it but we know, that it’s impossible for every person to have a creative job just because there aren’t creative jobs for everyone, so if we know that and we are increasingly producing lessons to stimulate the creative mind (let’s say because we think this is a preparation for the adult life and that it inevitably consists of some kind of job, so they need to be creative), aren’t we forgetting about the other half of the population who won’t have, or don’t want, creative jobs and in fact need other things in order to succeed?

The Kelly bag came into fruition in 1956 when a photo of Grace Kelly (who had become the new Princess of Monaco), was shown carrying the Sac à dépêches bag in a photograph in Life magazine. Purportedly, she held it in front of herself to cover up her pregnancy. Thus, the public began calling it the “Kelly” bag. The name was subsequently adopted by Hermès, and the bag became hugely popular.

I recently started indexing WWI, WWII, Death certificates, marriage licenses, birth certificates and the 1940 census. I was doing this a few years ago, but stopped because life got crazy. I started up again and they changed things up a bit with a point system for levels of difficulty which a competitive person like me loves. Here are a few things that I have noticed. First and foremost how important it is to decipher the handwriting on a document correctly. That is the only way people can find their ancestors and then when you get a bunch of crazy spellings because you can't read the handwriting it makes it so difficult to find them. There is a system in place that helps with it. What happens is that I index a document and then someone else somewhere indexes that same document. If there are discrepancies between the 2 of us a third person comes in and arbitrates. This helps with the accuracy. Then I also have the ability to challenge arbitration if I found out that the other person was chosen as correct in a document. does that make sense?

Therein lies a major problem. Politicians who are fighting over funding and labor contracts need to remember that they aren’t the stakeholders – the region’s residents (and businesses) are. The line would be paid for with tax dollars and it would serve residents and visitors. The debate needs to focus on the good of the region, not political opportunities for self-concerned politicians.

I got into the house, ripped open the box, literally. I am not using that cliched phrase for dramatic effect, I ripped that sucker open. Holy cow, it was awesome. Since we just talked things over in an email, I didn't have an image of exactly what the color would be or any specific details, only abstract images in my mind. I was just trusting Michael to translate my ideas into a workable holster and he did...except, when I went to put it on my belt my son said, "That is a right handed holster". "No, no, it's not." I assured him. "Mom, that is a right handed holster". I went upstairs got my gun, checked to be sure it was unloaded, tried to put it in my holster, but guess what? It was a right handed holster. My stomach sank.

And I can do it to warn everyone possible, via the big wide Internets: This is my documented experience with this publisher. We have a contract clause that was approved and initialed, but is not being honored. A critical contract clause—one that protects my interests in my book per the agreed-upon terms. A contract clause that is of utmost importance these days, when publishers and writers are scrambling to negotiate shifting terms and a shifting industry.

While it is a clearly floral based cologne with the tiniest hint of fruitiness, it is a quite clean and earthy scent. It’s quite different from many other fragrances I own – a casually charming scent that makes me feel like I’ve wandered through a meadow in the forest. That sounds a little ridiculous and silly now that I am actually writing it out, but I have actually walked through a meadow in a forest and Wild Bluebell brings me back to that memory – just a bit more whimsical.

By calling Fairport an English equivalent to the Band, I meant that they have soaked up enough of the tradition of their countryfolk that it begins to show all over, while they still maintain their roots in rock.

If not, it’ll probably take a little time, but it’ll be well worth the wait.

This is the third example of blatant violence -- and yes, terrorizing a young boy is violence -- by administration supporters since last summer. (While other incidents have occurred, going back to the Black Panthers menacing voters in Philly, these are the most blatantly violent.) The first was the case of Kenneth Gladney, who in St. Louis on August 6 last year was selling buttons and flags (identified as Gadsden flags, with the rattler and "Don't Tread on Me" slogan, one of the minor ironies of the incident) outside a town hall meeting being held by Democrat Congressman Russ Carnahan. The SEIU, ubiquitous at Democratic events these days, showed up to confront Gladney and demanded to know what "kind of shit" he was selling, along with calling him a nigger. (This from another black, which of course makes it okay.) Gladney's answers were evidently unsatisfactory, and he was then beaten, knocked down, and stomped on, suffering injuries that required hospital treatment. (The purple shirts were identified from video footage. All of them pleaded not guilty this past April 20 -- justice moves frighteningly fast in Missouri.)

Yep. Broken pretty much everywhere it's been tried, with the possible exception of Denmark, maybe Sweden - but I say that out of a profound ignorance, it might be just as bad there as say in England where it's going broke, and it takes months to have critical issues treated.
Tomorrow is the big day, Valentines! I made these kool Valentines for my tween's classmates. i used non-traditional colours because my kids like to be unique. I also found a "Star Wars" font so the boys' in her class don't feel it's too girly for them. I saw some of the cutest ideas on Pinterest, the Kool-aid cards were my favorite.
Some may find fault with this, but I find I look forward to Lent, if only for the culinary delights. I love fish; my husband just tolerates it.

We can learn from each of the circumstances in which the 200 were killed. On the margins, some of those deaths stemmed from a lack of professionalism, where a soldier didn’t do what he should have done. Obviously there are things to correct.
I have spoken primarily to believers who have already trusted Christ. If you have not trusted Christ, you need to recognize that He paid the penalty for your sin on the cross. He died for you. You need to be honest also. You need to admit that you are a sinner and that you cannot save yourself. You need the mercy available through faith in Christ. Will you trust him today?
Well, what else have I been up to? I am slowly getting through the back log of jobs around the cottage and am enjoying being able to spend more time reading, as when I was working a considerable amount of time had to be spent reading my professional journal and keeping myself up to date. I have also managed to spend a bit of time in the garden when the weather has permitted and am looking forward to spending more time out there, now that the days are getting warmer. In an attempt to prevent the days from all blurring into one I have started to go to a class on a Tuesday morning. I reckoned that by doing so I should at least know when it is Tuesday. The topic is flower arranging, which I have done before. The teacher is the same. The venue, time of day and classmates are different and I was surprised to find that one of them lives in the neighbouring village. Today we did a Continental Parallel arrangement, which I find difficult to do. Also I am not a great fan of modern arrangements but I am quite pleased with this morning's effort.

With the cheddar this was the first full-on clash of the day: the bitterness of the beer does not sit at all well with the sharpness of the cheese. It's a similar story with the blue: a double dose of acridity and the chocolate subtlety of the beer just disappears. A last-minute goal came from the Ardrahan, as the stout brings out all the creaminess in the cheese and combines it with its roasted and strong alcoholic flavours, producing a gorgeous kind of Irish coffee effect.

The originals hem was much longer in front and back. My front goes only to the floor (for walking and fabric saving purposes). They left a split in the side seams to floor level for that reason. I tried that, but didn't like the look without the longer front.

She hasn't had a migraine for probably two months now. (yay) She does get headaches if she's stressed or doesn't get enough sleep. We stick pretty tight to her bedtime, and giving her ibuprofen at the start of the headache has been effective in keeping them under control. Just like in Drew's situation, it's frustrating to know that it CAN be related to epilepsy but it might not be too. Feeling dumb for being so paranoid.

It was my intention to keep posting reviews of graphic novels and movies right up to this very day, the day where Nazi Germay surrendered once and for all to the Allies. But, scheduling weirdness with other projects and an unexpected (but very pleasant) development on my birthday--today--made it so virtually no Blogathon materials appeared this week.
If it's danger you're trying to avoid, then that will also rule out vacationing anywhere in the Middle East. Car bombs and suicide bombers notwithstanding, it’s also hard to find a place where you can knock back the dust of the desert with a cold beer. And if you pick up some goat-kabobs as a snack for you and the kids and accidentally shortchange the vendor, it could cost you an arm. Literally.
I’ve been told by some that “marriage isn’t just about sex.” I agree. But sexual love (EROS) is such an integral part of marriage that any marriage that lacks it is suffering from a shortage of love, just as a marriage that lacks any of the other three.

UPDATE AS OF 10 A.M. EDT, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 13:Workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant are pumping radioactive water from the concrete enclosure near reactor 2 into a turbine condenser. A series of aftershocks that rattled the area Tuesday has put the work behind schedule. Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) is inspecting another storage facility on the site to determine if it can hold contaminated water from the basement of the reactor 2 turbine building. Radioactive water in the turbine buildings is hampering efforts to restore cooling operations at the plant.

There’s just one problem with this: animals are dumb. They are far too dumb to predict the weather accurately.

That wouldn’t be anywhere near as adorable, though.

But all of these macro-level moments of significance pose a problem for The Keeper of Traken itself - one I remember vividly from when I finally got my hands on a VHS copy and watched the much-anticipated story. Yes, there are a bunch of things going on behind the scenes of tremendous importance for the future of the program, but they’re collectively a tiny fraction of what’s going on in this story and if they are the spirit in which the story is watched it ends up being quite a disappointment.

Before he stopped struggling, however, a heavy blow fell across my brow, sending me flying against the trunk of the tree that had concealed me. I maintained my senses enough to see what hit me.

In gathering this sample, the interviewers endeavoured to obtain a highly polarised group. That is, a particular effort was made to obtain people who were opposed to demonstrating as well as those who actively supported the cause. In contrast to the other sample of students to be reported, then, the non-demonstrators here are also to some extent anti-demonstrators. There were twenty-four demonstrators and twenty-seven non-demonstrators in the sample. A 'demonstrator' was defined as someone who answered 'Yes' to the question: 'Have you ever taken part in an anti-Apartheid demonstration?' appearing at the end of the questionnaire. All respondents answered yes or no.

In order to make it ‘palatable’ to adults, it features the comic stylings of Russel Brand as the voice of EB. While I have nothing against Russel Brand, most of the time I find myself asking the question ‘when did Russel Brand become a thing?’ while the CGI bunny talks like the Artful Dodger. (I have concluded, by the way, the Russel Brand became a thing because somebody saw him walking down the road and said “Is that Captain Jack Sparrow?”, and the rest, as they say, is history.) The movie isn’t funny, mostly because it’s trying so hard to be, and because Russel Brand seems to be the only person trying to tell jokes; the movie is, for some bizarre reason, a Russel Brand vehicle. And this is presumably a long time after everybody realized he isn’t really Captain Jack Sparrow.

Total Time ::: 1:35:41
I've been working on our home lately. Painting, buying stuff, moving furniture around - trying to visualize how all the pieces can fit together. What to keep, what to get rid of, what to re-furbish. And, of course, agonizing over color decisions. We've got some stuff, but not a lot...and it really is a mish-mash. Don't get me wrong - I love a good mish-mash! But it can definitely be a challenge to pull together.

I do not regret art school. I met, literally, no one worth remembering there and learned few usable skills, and it cost me tuition and a year of my life. But I think I would not be where i am today without it and I really did create some great pieces during that year I spent immersed in the miasmic creative fluid that is untapped and untrained and unhoned creativity. But I knew long before I was rejected by the more advanced majors of animation and illustration that I was never going to make it as an artist. I knew the say I stared at a blank canvas, brush in hand, and realized that my ideas are often bad and always impossible when it came to painting.

Mirrors are a gateway to other dimensions and you might like to try this simple exercise that I adapted from one I originally learned from Stuart Wilde that worked very well for me in my attempt to understand other worlds and dimensions. Stand in front of a full length mirror about five feet away,gaze at your reflection for a moment, still your mind then remember that your reflection in the mirror is in actual fact your mirror world self,as you do this visualise your reflection/mirror world self walking away backwards from you ten paces or so. When this is done slowly walk towards the mirror and gently try to push yourself through, as you do so turn around 90% and walk backwards through the mirror until you feel yourself entering the passageway that leads to the dimension beyond. Do not look back at this point just focus on the glass in front of you as if you are looking into the room you started. Walk back about 10 paces and stop. Feel around you with your senses and try to remember the sensations you get, breathe deeply and do not panic too much.

Kegan has had three occupational therapy sessions now, and I'm really starting to see improvement. He is much more content, spends more time "chillin" now doing things other than hyper/destructive/aggressive activity. We still have incidents, but they are definitley decreasing. But hey, he's only 4, and a lot of his behavioral habits have to be retrained, but I am so excited that he is "with us" so much more...I'm more able to reach him every day, and he is also more aware of himself within his surroundings (physical objects, people, etc.) I know it will take time before he develops full age-appropriate self-control and physical ability, but I'm amazed at the difference. And the greatest thing is that it's not just me. His teach took me aside a couple days ago to tell me how much improvement she is seeing in his being calmer and able to sit, decreased aggression, better listening, and even better fine motor skills (his handwriting is improving). Also, today was my surgery to have my wisdom teeth pulled, so my mom took care of him. She took him to her quilting group for four hours!! Anytime she has ever tried to take him there, they have had to leave within a half hour...he would climb on stuff, grab stuff, generally not listen, and be destructive, and not to mention the fits and crying...Today, she took her portable DVD player down, and he watched a move and colored and did kiddy worksheets "homework." She said he was also polite and respectful to the ladies, helping them and saying "thank you." =) I'm so proud of him!!! I know he is going to be an amazing man one day, and I feel so blessed to be a part of his life...sometimes I just cry when I think about the fact that he would most likely have died within another month if CPS did not remove him, and now look at him go!!

This great global vision of the Christian movement becomes clear and powerful and compelling in pastors' lives whenever there is Biblical awakening in Christ's people - as there was among many in the first decades of the 1800s when Adoniram Judson was converted and called into missions along with hundreds of others as the light and power of truth awakened the churches.

Seriously. The numbers don’t lie. Of the over 40 million children in the USA, just about 150-200 are kidnapped (in the traditional sense, by a “bad guy/stranger”) each year. Less than half of that number ends up dead. All those missing child statistics out there are very misleading and do not account for the fact that most of those reported missing are runaways, kids who were taken by another parent, kids who are late for curfew, kids whose parents mixed up who had visitation that weekend, and so forth. Sites which claim that a child “goes missing every 40 seconds” are not being forthright the situation involved in that missing child report.

Jeb Bush campaigned vigorously in 2010 to expand such reforms, with tremendous success. About a month after the election, he unveiled his road map for implementing a far-reaching ten-point agenda for virtual schools and online coursework. Former West Virginia Governor Bob Wise, a Democrat, has barnstormed the country to encourage lawmakers to adopt Bush’s plan, which calls for the permanent financing of education-technology reforms, among other changes. In one promotional video, Wise says it is “not only about the content” of the online courses but the “process” of students becoming acquainted with learning on the Internet.
“Renovations were not just done, they were badly done. So much so that it cost me a fortune to fix them. My advice for future home-buyers? Check every inch of your house. To home sellers, if you want to get the best resale value for your home, get your renovations done by an expert,” Lalitha says.

The titular barbarian of A Barbarian in Asia is Henri Michaux (1889-1984), who, the back of the book informs us, was a “great French poet and painter” who “set out as a young man to see the Far East.” The barbarian’s sensibility is certainly poetic. He is interested in conveying the feelings of elsewhere, the contours of its sentimental landscape, not the brute facts. (Though Michaux is quite conversant in Eastern literature and religion.) He sets the tone on the opening page of the opening section, “A Barbarian in India,” by calling Calcutta “the most crowded city in the Universe.” Is Calcutta the most crowded city in the Universe? Impossible to be certain. But to the barbarian in India, it certainly feels that way, and the purpose of travel (as opposed to tourism) is to feel. We travel to feel when our everyday surroundings have made us numb.
I also am ambivalent about Ysrael’s role in the story. The tension he supposedly brought between the two sisters felt overwrought to the point of ridiculousness, and I was never convinced of Ysrael as a person. For me, he never broke out of that love interest role he was designated and failed to come across as anything beyond a two-dimensional typical love interest boy in these YA contemporary romances. (You know, the whole perfect considerate boy walking in and changing the heroine’s life for the better.) I’m tired of having The Man being a catalyst for all of the heroine’s major changes in her life. Their whole shared music passion also failed to be believable for me as well, since their interest in music was portrayed vaguely at best and I’ve seen other YA books wherein two characters bond over music done much better than here. And also I just didn’t really buy the part wherein Ysrael supposedly opened Mina’s eyes to different future possibilities. The scene played out as if Mina never even heard of the possibility of doing what she wanted, which I found utterly unbelievable. I bought the ties between Ysrael and Suna even less. (Basically, comparing Ysrael's scar to Suna's hearing aid just did not fly for me, and was a very superficial tie at best. Also they had no romantic tension whatsoever.) Finally, I thought that in spending all that time developing a connection between Ysrael and Mina, the development of Mina and Suna’s relationship suffered because of it, focusing too much on the love triangle dynamic instead of the sisterly bond. It would have been fine if An Na intended the novel to be primarily about the budding romance, but it’s clear to me from its premise and execution that the family was and should have been the dominating storyline. I mean, I did like some scenes with Ysrael in it, (the kiss scene was simply beautiful) and certainly it’s nice to have at least one healthy relationship depicted in a novel (because Mina’s relationship with everyone else in this novel – Jonathon, Suna, Uhmma – were so incredibly dysfunctional) but this subplot just didn’t intertwine convincingly into the main story.

From that time until just yesterday, my sister had been with Daisy and Cook, except over the weekend where she slept on our couch. Only reason sis did not stay overnight with us during weekdays was because she has work early in the morning, and mom stays up late in the living room. She would keep Sis up until late hours every day which just won't do! During this time period, we were feverishly working on both her room and out storage room (which is next to her room).

So, I just found out today that March is National Crochet Month. It’s not very often I pick up the hook, and when I do, it’s usually because I need more potholders. But I think it’s time I actually make something to wear, that I can finish during this month (which rules out the 40″ x 40″ bathroom rug I need to make, for which I bought yarn two years ago). So here are my two choices:
on the character in Pride and Prejudice, but if she is to be the protagonist, we need to empathise with her to some degree.’ (For a wonderful article on ‘likeability’ in fictional characters, see Charlotte Wood’s blog here). But the editor’s comment did point to my difficulty in reimagining Mary. On the one hand, I wanted to stick to Austen’s script and not ignore unattractive aspects of the character, but I also wanted the reader to empathise with Mary, to appreciate what a difficult hand she’d been dealt. She’s ‘the only plain one’ of the five Bennet sisters after all, and as a middle child she’s isolated within her own family, having no confidante among her sisters. And neither of her parents favours her— Mrs Bennet spoils her youngest daughter, Lydia, while Mr Bennet always gives his second daughter, Elizabeth, the preference.

Science and technology has brought a phenomenal change in the career and technology education. Vocational education has evolved to prepare students to work efficiently, after completing high school and graduation. In the U.S., practically one-third of the college students are involved in vocational programs. About 40 million adults are engaged in short-term, post-secondary vocational training. Students need to analyze their preferences, before choosing a vocation.
There is so much covering up of our acts of government that when good citizens blow the whistle on something they find out about, the Espionage Act is invoked to attempt to silence these whistle blowers. There is a very dark history of the Espionage Act. It was enacted by President Woodrow Wilson in 1917 to silence war detractors from speaking out about WW1, which Wilson wanted. I urge you to look up all the “dirty” deeds that were enacted against American citizens that spoke up against the war. Do we really want a country where we cannot speak freely without fear of retribution? Will it’s happening folks, right now, today.

The weather here over the weekend has not been fantastic. I was scheduled to take a PDI for his part3 test today but the DSA cancelled it due to the weather. C'est la vie.
**(Nip/Tuck #8, The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet’s Nest) 2 videos in 1 night that had similar scenes of 1-2 person(s) on a moped/skateboards (both odd) stealing/knocking a woman’s large purse/sack off her shoulder as she walks down a public road/sidewalk AND which had people recovering from surgeries.
This past year has been wonderful, emotional, fun, exciting, scary but great. I have learned so much about myself and have come to appreciate the fabulous friend I have in Nick. I made life friends in Ann Arbor and missed my friends and family in SLC.
“Shahzeb had called me last night.”
The way forward is in the concentration on the details, putting one foot in front of the other, doing small deeds as necessary and joining together with others in unison when the opportunities to do so present themselves.

BUT, there's the DH. And as long as there's the DH in the AL and not in the NL, the two leagues are not alike. As long as the DH separates the two leagues there will be arguments, drama, complaints, bragging, strategy … and these are some of the things that give baseball life and flavor.

So here is our Baby Booth at the end of Day One... still so much to add and do, I have three boxes of goodies headed over today. But we've got a good base, just needs to be fluffed but that's the fun part.
As I look back, I believe it was the grace of God that the stranger did not influence us more. Time after time, he opposed the values of parents, yet he was seldom rebuked and never asked to leave. Nearly forty years have passed since the stranger moved in with us, but if I were to walk into my parent’s home today, I would still see him sitting there waiting for someone to listen to his stories and watch him draw his pictures.
An instant classic that recently joined the ranks of 'affordable gourmet' stationed in the bourgeoning foodie mecca that is Culver City, the place is named after a a railway line in the London Underground (aka "the Tube") - that only services two train stations "Waterloo", and "City" (for London City) - which, according to the website, is where Executive Chef Brendan Collins' initiated his youthful adventures.

There’s the “emergency penguin” – a felt penguin head on a stick so-called because it seems to have have the mystical ability to instantly stop any size of baby tantrum. That has a bell inside it. There’s also the baby’s rattle, the Christmas bib that has somehow not yet made its way into the washing machine, a squeaky little rubber alien that the baby likes to gnaw on… frankly it’s more difficult to think of something inside my bag that *doesn’t* make a comedy noise of some sort.

But Ching must have put some kind of a Chinese curse on him, for in 1918, W.E. Robinson a.k.a Chung Ling Soo died onstage in a freak accident. Have you ever watched a magician catch a bullet shot from a gun, and ask yourself, “How does he do that? Isn’t that dangerous?” The answer is, yes. Yes, it is. Chung’s trick gun fired a real bullet into his chest at the Wood Green Empire theatre in London. Cosmic justice of a sort, wouldn’t you say?

The first notice targeted the “Falun Gong Research Society” as an organization, rather than Falun Gong itself. In fact, that ban itself does not stand up. Falun Gong, after approval from the Chinese Qigong Scientific Research Society in 1993, was absorbed as a subordinate entity called the “Falun Gong Research Branch.” Mr. Li Hongzhi concluded the teaching of the practice in Mainland China and outside of China in December 1994 and 1995, respectively. From that point on, Mr. Li focused on research of the Buddha Law and stopped the activity of giving Qigong classes. Accordingly, the Falun Gong Research Society formally petitioned for withdrawal from the Chinese Qigong Scientific Research Society in March of 1996, and upon approval from the Chinese Qigong Scientific Research Society, completed the procedures for its dissolution from the research society. Thus, the Falun Gong Research Society ceased to exist from that point on. How could an entity that was dissolved in March of 1996 be banned in July of 1999?
Having at length, by an open and straightforward deportment, removed any false impression which may have existed in the mind of B 66 regarding my motives at the Farringdon Street terminus, I determined to return by the next train; and in order that I might lose no opportunity of seeing 'London Society' in every aspect, underground, I took a second-class ticket half the way back, determining to complete my journey by the third. I found my fellow-passengers more garrulous in these carriages than they had been in the first which I entered. Whether a half-cushioned vehicle encourages conversation more than one which is completely padded, or whether our English notions of 'genteel' reticence are confined to the upper circles, I cannot say, but in the second class, everyone was talking. Half the 'fares' had come in breathless, and were congratulating each other all round on having 'jist' caught the train. After all that has been said in favour of punctuality, its being the 'soul of business' and so forth, I doubt whether those over-precise people who are always to be found everywhere half an hour before necessary, can know the pleasure derivable from just 'saving the post,' catching the Ostend boat only a minute before it starts, or entering a theatre exactly when the curtain rises. There is a sort of triumph in the fact that you have wasted no leisure in attaining your object, that there has been no wearying delay in its accomplishment. There you are, just in the nick of time. The clock hand trembles on to six; the 'departure' bell is ringing on the shore; the last few bars of the overture are being played. Pop in your letter - jump on board - rush to your vacant scat. You are breathless, perhaps, and rather warm; but what matters. You are in time, hurray! I know the feeling of satisfaction which in short, I confess I am an unpunctual man myself.

Well, I decided to jump on the zombie bandwagon (LOL) and make a zombie-themed card. I chose to work with Zombie Kellita. Now, I don't know what's up with my camera lately, but it seems like my cards end up looking a little distorted for some reason. I promise that my card has straight edges and isn't crooked!

Normally on the Thursday before Viernes Santa (Good Friday), the asados linger on into the night and the alcohol flows freely. However, a cold, windy storm blew in midday and knocked out electricity till midnight, so it was pretty quiet in Party World. We usually hear, late into the night, the bass of the sound system and the howling of the dancers, but got a reprieve. There was a beautiful full moon that lit up the yard, so we sat outside and visited with neighbors who dropped by.

Learning is a lifelong journey – there is always something new to learn. Interestingly enough, there are many people who feel that once they leave school – they need to learn no more. How sad! Some people wake up and smell the roses later on in life but then feel they are ‘too old’ to learn! Are we ever too old to learn?

The next day I had to say goodbye to salty sea air and the embrace of the ocean. I ache for it still, here in the dry heat so many miles away from warm, clear waters. Arizona has been so good to me this last year and I will always love this place. But my mind has already started to plan my next move; one that will set my clock back to island time.
It bears mentioning that the Widmers have dealt a blow the cause to popularize the "Cascadian Dark Ale" style. Instead of calling this beer by that name on the label, they have gone with "Black IPA." Whether this beer actually qualifies as a Cascadian Dark Ale is another matter (sometimes the distintion is lost on me), but if Widmer ends up with a big hit, Black IPA may blot out the sun as far as nomenclature goes, leaving Cascadian Dark Ale as a cool coulda-been.

Briana didn’t know how long the teenaged kiss had gone on.. seconds? Minutes? She’d laid her hand back against his chest and felt his heart beating quickly under her fingers. She jumped when she heard her brother calling for her. “Oh!” she’d exclaimed. “I have to go!” She leapt to her feet, and ran from the shore before her brother could find her with this gypsy boy.
Shortly after 10 am Dawn encouraged me to get up and take a walk out in the yard. It served as a great distraction, as well as making sure things didn’t slow down too much. I remember thinking how great the sunshine felt, and how fabulous it was that we’d decided to put up such a nice fence for support during surges. Oh and by the way, all you fashionistas out there who might have the audacity to criticize the wardrobe, white socks with sandals is perfectly acceptable for women in labor!
I knew I had this power to light a fire under the CE’s ass without getting burned 3 months in with this company. I fussed, I threw the most epic of tantrums (I was sharing an office with the passive aggressive sales manager at the time) and quite honestly I was terrified of the response I would get from it, but all I got was “ok. take a room out of order and disperse the furniture how you see fit. we’ll get her moved out by the weekend”.
A busy day here and a busy day there. The clock will fly by and 5pm will come...but where did 12 go? The yogurt will help and the apple a day still will keep the doctor away. BUT as I keep forgetting to eat lunch these crazy days a weird occurrence will happen. Dinner will come and I will be so famished that it's almost a mania when I get home. I want this and that and maybe a lil bit of this and a tench of that. Ugh. It's a vicious cycle that goes round and round.
This case is being said that it will draw more attention than OJ Simpson did in his trial, as being accused of killing his wife. There is still no reason why millions of people got involved in this case. If it wasn’t people protesting at the actual home, then its the hundreds of bloggers that write about this story. Why? There are hundreds of kids who get killed by their parents every day. None of them make national headlines. Supposedly, it’s the way Casey Anthony acted. Perhaps its her way of acting as if she could care less. Maybe it was the knowledge that this child was missing over a month and the mother never mentioned it to anyone, but instead, chose a life of clubbing and partying. America and other countries, Yes other countries reached out after hearing this story. Some of my comments came from Japan.

So I sit at a desk in that lilac chair- but behind me I also have an enormous closet that will house my printer, a desk for my laptop where I do my CAD magic, and all my junk. The wall in there has the opportunity to be insane and fabulous, and since the doors close I am going to stress the insane part. There is also a guest bed in here, so that way I can close the insanity and folks can get a peaceful nights sleep.

I have another dream which bothers me. It’s a recurring dream that is also very vivid and I think about it often. It takes a number of forms but basically I am living near the coast or in a city with a river running through it (yes, that would be Brisbane). Suddenly there is a tsunami and the sea rises up and destroys the town. Everyone is madly running as fast as they can go, trying to outrun the waves, trying to get to higher territory. The waves do not retreat and the place is completely swamped. I make it safely to higher ground, along with a small group of family, friends and some strangers. We travel as far away from the town as we can get, still fearful of the rising waters. We travel into the hills, to the most beautiful place in the world and we are safe. We decide to make that place our new home. Most people have not survived and we are very grateful that we did.
That was a huge problem.

Look, suffice it to say, the Yards brewery right now is down to a dirt floor, and they're going to be building up on the screw piles to a heavy reinforced concrete (or "ferroconcrete," as the Brits call it, a much cooler word) floor to support the brewing equipment.

Sure, both have two Super Bowl victories under their belts, but I want Parcells rebuilding my franchise when it comes down to it.

Starving yourself, having inadequate meals or skipping meals can lead to overeating and (according to the article) sends a distress signal to your brain that triggers cravings.

We all know the drill. You go hard and after the steam and shower you’re starving. You walk out of your gym and: a) stop at the juice spot for a smoothie, b) pop into the bodega for one of those protein bar things, c) chug some post-workout powdered crap, d) eat junk. You know what sucks about all these options? They all have high calories and lots of processed junk. Have you ever really thought about what’s in one of those post workout powders or bars? How about the 4 pumps of agave they put in your smoothie?
Two months later, Dad died suddenly; a shock, yes, but a blessing as well in that he never lost himself or his sense of dignity. His funeral brought a mix of joy and sadness, laughter and tears. And when the last hymn was played by the organist, we processed into the church hall where the women of the parish had set up everything for us. There was a party for my father, a celebration of a life well-lived and a man who knew scarcity but celebrated with abundance.

On the other hand many of L’Olimpiade‘s arias are pure vocal exhibition. “Mi sento, O Dio, Nel Core” (“I feel, oh gods, in this heart”) for soprano with obbligato oboe is a magnificent traffic jam of an aria [which starts at 1:38 in the clip below], with an overly long, tacked on introduction, an impossibly high tessitura (even for a pro like Patrizia Ciofi) and gratuitous (even for eighteenth century audiences) coloratura. It also seems to go on forever, but makes for a hell of a show. In Cimarosa’s time, even serious opera was rarely “drama,” and “high art” only well after the final curtain: it was was vocal showpiece, spectacle, an athletic event and even a competition, a night of ” can they make it?”

Precisely this lettering was the trademark of the first Porsche with the “R” designation, the 911 R of 1967. It was created for racing sport use in a small series of 19 cars.

Even so, my rule of thumb is always to check the most reliable snapshot of conditions on the ground closer to the time. The resources I use are the British Foreign Office website, UK FO website, the Australian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade counterpart, OZ MOFA and, lastly, the US State Department Travel Advisories, which seem to tend to ‘trail’ the two previous sources in terms of being up-to-date with the most factually accurate reports.

But these shoes are Jimmy Choo and cost $785. Which makes me think they are actually designed for Colombian hookers to wear when playing Secret Service–Call of Booty.
Regarding the "evidence" he demands from software patentees, the European Commission has funded a study on the legal, technical and economic effects of software patents on innovation, but the study is not due to be finished until 2007. However, there are preliminary studies that have been conducted in the US that show that software patents are important, especially to smaller companies. One study, conducted by Ronald J. Mann from the University of Texas School of law, supports this notion, and further rejects the idea of "patent thickets" being the bane of software innovation. Regardless, there is no econometric or bibliometric data in existence today that shows that software patents are impeding the advance of software.
Here is a side shot for a better view of the window, I am also adding this card to the current Hero Arts challenge for shaped cards and for The Lily Pad flowers challenge.

Me: Ohhh! Can I start something on fire?
But what is the reason? Most scholars mine the text for explicit clues and they engage in what’s known as “mirror reading” – that is, assuming the situation is related to the opposite of what is said in the letter. Does Paul say to unify? Perhaps they’re dealing with division. That sort of thing. Mirror reading is rather speculative in nature, but it can be useful.
That turned out to be a mixed blessing too. The agent’s advice improved my manuscript, and I learned something else in the process – what writers should and shouldn’t do when searching for representation. But in the end, the steam engines were spinning their wheels in that particular situation.
So ya i guess that'd be my bad news...i will still try to update and try to find new things to write about, but until my allergy gets better, no make up post.....
"A good driving track with an infectious guitar riff. The production is good as is the quality of the vocal and backing. The only thing sightly lacking is any form of variation or light and shade. The song could do with a middle 8 or something contrasting to break it up a bit and to give the track structure, otherwise it can tend to be a bit bland after several listens. At 2:42 it could also do with a bit of lengthening."
AlterNet asked the NRC if it is concerned about the vulnerability of the spent fuel at Fukushima Daiichi and what, if anything, it had expressed to the Japanese government and Tepco on the matter.
Long story short (guess it's too late for that), this is a cool thing to do, but only if you have the financial resources to use - aka rental cars, food, plane tickets, time off work, etc. Plus there are several people selling their time shares online for a lot cheaper and for more credits.
If you are fully satisfied in every area of you life then your wheel is round and you can easily keep on rolling! Of course, we all have to work at keeping our lives in balance.
CONSENSUS: Out from Boneville is an energetic start to a great graphic novel series, but it has surprisingly inappropriate content, salty language, and just some sloppy feel.

Context is becoming so important on the Web that many thinkers are claiming sites will deemphasize Search Engine Optimization (SEO — a way to get your site highly placed on Google) and pay more at­tention to Social Graph Optimization (SGO — optimizing the people and their content that will refer traffic to your site).
Usually, we gather at a local watering hole on a Sunday afternoon for laughs, conversation, nibblies and pints and, to this point in time, we’ve only been banished from two bars (one mainstream, one gay).
In the best case situation, someone will come to us in the spring and offer us at least what we paid for our house and be happy to close in 6-8 weeks. Then once the contract is signed we will fly to Portland to find housing and hopefully schedule a closing about a week after selling our house. I very much realize how extremely unlikely this is, but this would be my perfect scenario.
Now, in the category of "no good deed goes unpunished", there's this:

THIS cuts to the core of a woman being able to decide FOR HERSELF, when she wants children, and how many and to keep the CONTROL for such issues, and her SEXUALITY IN HER OWN HANDS.
Sword of Mordrey is set during the first crusade, and the year just after it. This bit of exposition that came up in my WIP is from the view point of Tristan, a bard who travels medieval England. He’s on his way to Chilham Castle, but has become disoriented in a storm and seeks refuge in a castle perched upon a high cliff above the ocean, its stone walls black and running with rain. He enters the great hall and begs leave of the lord to remain until the storm abates, offering to entertain them with song in exchange for food and shelter. Permission is granted, but Tristan soon has feelings of foreboding about the place.

Today over 60 countries had introduced laws to enforce the marketing standards we helped to bring at the World Health Assembly, the world's highest health policy setting body. However, according to industry analysts Euromonitor: "The industry is fighting a rearguard action against regulation on a country-by-country basis".

All in all, very successful, except I have 20 hens and there are approximately ten nests that are used on a rota basis. I don't need to join a gym really. Clearly the girls confer during the night in order to test my resolve. Last week they lay eggs behind the huge mountain of logs in the woodshed and the saying 'I saw something nasty in the woodshed!' has never been truer. I made it to the top of the unsteady pile and spotted 6 eggs but then the pile moved and I ended up on my derriere. Apparently country folk are taught from an early age not to climb bales or wood stacks, this wasn't mentioned in St John's Wood, London.
My brother Barney Jones likes to modify the lyrics of his favorite songs and chant them like existential poetry. When I picked him up recently at his boarding home, he let a verse fly after he struggled into his seatbelt and threw his art books onto the back seat. “I’m a real nowhere man, going in a nowhere van, riding with my sister to our nowhere land.”
Today its cold and wet out. The boys are back from their weekend away with their father and its not a 'going out' sort of day. Tim has writing to do and I've been setting magazine pages ready for the May edition. The deadline for entries isn't until next week but there is too much to do to leave it to the last minute so I tend to work on things as they come in.
I have my new camera charged and ready so you can bet I will be having some fun with scrapbooking :) Maybe I can conjur something up while I am playing in my mom's craft room next week to share with you.
I gave a talk about baptism this weekend at a retreat, and by sheer coincidence/providence I happened to visit – for the first time ever as an adult – the church of my own baptism in west London. I knew it was there; I’d just never made the time to go and find it.

After weigh in I went to Olive Garden to eat as many carbs as I could. Who do you think walks in? Laura, her mom, and another young wrestler. I was eating by myself and Laura came over to "tell" me to come over to eat with them. There's not many people who tell me to do things, but this was so cute. So I did. It was touching, and in the scheme of things I won't remember the outcomes of the matches as much as the simple acts of kindness.

Cherie is from a breeder… after she got sick she didn’t grow anymore but stayed quite tiny. She didn’t fulfill the standard measurements of the regular Persian breed and couldn’t be „used for breeding“ anymore. The breeder gave her to Mommy’s friend and said: „Find her a home. I’ll pay for her for a month. If nobody has taken her in until then I’ll have her euthanized.” Mommy got so angry, she drove seven hours to pick Cherie up and another ride of 7 hours to take her back. That was 8 years ago and now Cherie is almost 9 and an old lady. LOL

Our side trip to Sego Canyon took only a few hours, but it was well worth the diversion. You’ll find very few places that provide such a large window into the past in such a small area. So, the next time you’re heading down the empty country along I-70 in eastern Utah, be sure and check out these magnificent panels of ancient art and a well-preserved ghost town.
Well, I unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your perspective) have several of those bottles. Most of those bottles are old (10-20 years old or more). Don’t get the wrong idea–I can’t afford the retail price of most of the wine I drink (and neither can my wife for all of you smart alecks out there). I just spend waaaay too much time searching for wine on the internet. A lot of people come by wine by any number of means and some of them just want to sell it. And I will buy it, but usually not at their price. I am always willing to walk away, but sometimes I get some really good wines at really great prices–but we are getting way too deep into the subject of a couple of other posts. Back to Saturday night.
WASHINGTON, April 25 (UPI) — President Obama, citing the United States’ national security interests, Wednesday waived restrictions on funding for the Palestinian Authority.

Single women you are important in Christ. Understand your role in Christ and embrace it. It’s not a curse to be single. You have all the time to become more intimate with God. It is time to pursue those dreams and set the goals that would build your womanhood and character. Study the word. Marriage has its rainy days too. Let God make the choice of if, who, when, where, what and how. It’s his purpose you are supposed to be living for. Put that flesh in check. I find it funny that most women and men that are married want to be single. Of course I am enjoying my marriage but not all married couples could say the same. Those single wants to be married… God will guide you to that path of righteousness!

Tips and Tricks:
A bit of jargon will unfortunately be necessary. Human beings, according to the teaching you’re about to receive, normally think in binaries—that is, polarized relationships between one thing and another, in which the two things are seen as total opposites. That habit is universal and automatic enough that it’s most likely hardwired into our brains, and there’s good reason why it should be. Most of the snap decisions our primate ancestors had to make on the African savannah are most efficiently sorted out into binary pairs: food/nonfood, predator/nonpredator, and so on. The drawbacks to this handy set of internal categories don’t seem to bother any of our primate relatives, and probably became an issue—like so much that’s part of magic—only when the rickety structure of the reasoning mind took shape over the top of the standard-issue social primate brain.
Make sure to hop on over to the Lollipop Crafts blog today to see what the rest of the A-Team created using images from Kitty Bee Designs. There are so many KAWAII images it was really hard to choose just one for me, so I had to choose a few which I bought. (Always willing to support our small businesses. Click HERE to go to my Easter post to see one of the other images I bought) I used the adorable Bath Time Pup digi for my card today. When I purchased this image I was thinking it would be perfect for a baby card. I have a quite a few co-workers who are preggers and I know that I will need to stock up on these kinds of cards to either use or distribute to those who might not have time to run next door to buy one.

According to them, well see for yourself-
A daylight collaring operation offered a rare opportunity to catch some good photos and video, so before we opened the trap, we stationed three people with still and video cameras at different angles to the trap entrance. I was crouched behind a tree and a snow bank a few yards in front the trap, hoping that she would run by me. The lid creaked up, and a few seconds passed, and then, like a periscope, the collar antenna emerged, followed by F3′s head. We had waited for about ten minutes for M57 to leave the trap; F3 took one look at freedom and then she poured out of the trap’s mouth and, in a blur of snow, streaked towards me. I didn’t realize it until I looked at the photos and videos later, but she actually headed directly towards me before catching sight of me and then veering to the left, around me, and then off into the woods. She took about five seconds to disappear.

This appeal relates solely to the stayed counterclaims for Glenayre's contributory and induced infringement based on direct infringement by Glenayre's customers. These counterclaims were excluded from the jury trial. The district court decided, after this court affirmed the Rule 54(b) judgment of direct infringement, to dismiss the counterclaims without further proceedings. The district court, today affirmed by the panel majority, incorrectly held that there cannot be contributory infringement by a direct infringer. From this ruling and its flawed premises, I respectfully dissent.
All of which, lead us to Robin, Hopscotch and our beautiful, precious, perfect in every way, Armenian Angel! On December 1st, our little guy Chance will turn six years old.

The lid reveals that this a Processed Fine Cheese Spread, part of the Agropur Signature series. Now I’m a little confused and a little curious as to what I will discover under that lid. I was tempted to lift the lid in the store but I was not sure what was beneath. I did not want to break a seal.

I know you're bored and thinking how can this possibly pertain to me? What can be fun about munching on veggies all day? Trust me when I say that this is not what they do and in fact have some incredibly AMAZING recipes. Not all tofu and chickpeas all the time, trust me and if a born and bred Nebraska girl, raised on beef and potatoes can love it, you all will love it more! To prove my point, this post is dedicated to all of my (well, mostly the boys') favorite Vegan sites and recipes.

Yesterday, it was reported that the government’s former ‘drug tsar’ – the interestingly-named Professor David Nutt - was suggesting that “a clinical trial of ‘magic mushroom therapy’ could take place in the UK within a year following two ground-breaking studies” which seem to show that the hallucinogenic active ingredient in magic mushrooms can help the treatment of serious depression.

He whispered in her ear, “You’re like an angel, got me feeling like a devil, and I wanna give you something, if you promise that you won’t tell“. He pulled a piece of black licorice out of his pocket, and dangled it in front of her. “My favorite vice”, he said “besides coffee.” “Goes good with the whiskey”, he breathed in my face. She leaned forward and they took a bite together. He smelled deliciously of well-earned sweat, whiskey, licorice and a faint lingering scent of cologne. She inhaled deeply, to imprint his pheromones in her senses forever.
That would kinda make sense too, huh?
Decisions about our area are taken further away. Take housing. When I was elected, Swale Housing Association was based wholly in the borough. Today AmicusHorizon has offices in Surrey and Sussex and is a medium sized social enterprise with assets of £638m and an annual turnover of £153m. The main board meets miles and miles away. We’re lucky to see a minute of a decision about a stationery order never mind an affordable home being built.

I am child-free by choice, but that doesn't mean I am not grateful for my childhood. In the grand scheme of things, I probably had a fairly 'normal' upbringing - loving parents and siblings, good relationships with friends and extended family. Pets...there were a few. We had cats, guppies and a rabbit called 'Pookie'...And of course, the benefit of a good education and a safe environment in which to live. Sadly, that is not the case for many children across the world who face poverty, neglect and abuse.
The English Beat appeared on American Bandstand twice in the span of just seven months, which is testament to their growing popularity here in the U.S. and their appearance at both US Festivals. In fact, they were the only band to be invited to play both the 1982 and 1983 US Festival's. The two invitations are a testament to the hard work they put into breaking the U.S. The release of 'Special Beat Service" in the US in 1982 had solidified them as a "new wave" band rather than a ska band and that helped to expand their audience here.

Fito de la Parra and Larry Taylor form a formidable rhythm section and really keep things moving nicely. Jay Spell's stride piano playing defines "Boogie-Woogie Blues". Mike Mann may have been the most under-rated guitar player in the business. All together these guys made great music - I dare anyone to sit still while this disc is playing.

What if I didn’t need a better prayer life, but could just say things—unfiltered, uncensored—and God would hang on every word, like a father holding his little child? What if I didn’t need to be perfect, but was already perfect because He refuses to see me any other way? What if I didn’t need to get close to God, because Jesus has already brought me oh so close through His cross?—so close that I’m actually inside of God and He, inside of me. What if Jesus doesn’t care if I’m 99% or 63% surrendered to Him at any given moment, but what if He surrendered to me, surrendered to the weight of my sin and the destruction I’ve caused at the foot of a wooden cross so many long years ago? What if He was the one who was selfless, who was patient and perfect and full of glory and fire for God? And what if, He did it all for me? To count those beautiful realities true of me even though they technically aren’t. Not to manipulate me into doing Christian things that will further His ‘cause’, but for me. For you. For every person who was ever born.

It even had a jingle composed by the gifted Jose Marie Chan , whose lyrics I have learned from a classmate who became a very good friend until now. I have to admit I missed those commercials .

Daniel 8:7
While he had a strong enough grip to get the job done in college, I’d like to see Andrew continue to improve his functional strength at the next level. He shows good hand placement with proper technique in his ability to fire his hands inside on the defender and uses his flexibility and wide frame to make it difficult for rushers to get around him on the edge. I’d like to see Datko get stronger in the lower half in order to improve as an anchor in pass protection, as he isn’t yet strong enough to take on and consistently neutralize some of the bigger, stronger ends he’ll face at the next level. He’s not a full-fledged drive blocker in the run game, and while he’s shown enough of an ability to execute down blocks in college, I’d like to see him continue to develop better lower body strength to improve here. In the run game, he uses his quick feet off the ball to his advantage with his ability to engage the defensive lineman off the ball before attempting to properly position the defender away from the hole to wall him off an open up a clear running lane. Having played in Florida State’s zone-blocking offense, he could be an intriguing fit for the Packers blocking scheme.
I’m a pretty sensitive person: if you hang around me long enough, chances are you’ll see me cry (very likely), get mad (used to be much more likely, but definitely not out of the question), or a whole range of emotional responses that aren’t exactly beneficial to anyone. Couple that with a below-average self-esteem, and you get a girl that’s rather timid until someone reaches out to her, and is quick to retreat to the shadows once her paranoia kicks in (conclusion: innate loner mentality).

When I go to workshops, I am so respectful, I rarely ask the artist what isn't working, what hasn't worked or things that don't' work - but I want to (I did once because they opened the door). Perfection is lauded and encouraged, and it should be. Excellence is probably a much better word. The learning, the practice, the hours, days, years of arriving at excellence, however, is about what didn't work. All the things that didn't work that added up to making great work. Right? I wish we (the collective creative community we) talked about this more. There is a confidence in putting the whole show out there. The ability to express the failing along with the winning. In my mind, as I write this, I picture those backdrop photos we all see so often with jacked up, shitty pieces that would normally not see the light of day. They are what make us good at our trade. Why aren't we proud of them.

With chlorella, a little goes a long way. Even adding a teaspoon to a big ol’ smoothie will do you worlds of good. Yes, it’s a little pricey, but it lasts a very long time, and in my opinion, it’s worth every penny.
I wanted to make something for her before she left and I only had a few days (workdays) after my previous trip to plan, shop and to make it, so there wasn't much I could do. I decided to make a display cake with the blue/silver theme to get that "fairy tale" feeling and make verrines for the dessert. N loves the rose-lychee combination, and so I decided to make a verrine that incorporates raspberry, rose, and lychee. You might think that I make this combination too often, but I do love it that much, the combination of flavors and the appearance, again, Pierre Herme is a genius for coming up with this combo among many others.
We fear the unknown only if we fear our own imagination. The same could be said of disaster. If we dig into disaster, with the power of our imagination we may become inoculated against it.

We've got some interest...but this is totally grassroots. This isn't a sponsored event, it's not organized (if you know me, you know that), and it's simply about going out and drinking session beer -- 4.5% or lower, good-tasting, great beer -- and enjoying it.
Congress took control of spending, and that includes Barack Obama, who voted
Then Van Morrisson’s Sweet Thing came on. Sweet Thing! In a coffee shop! Such sublime, intensely personal and beautiful music, just spread out like furniture or cheap incense from a stall in Camden market. I don’t know how people can just go about their business while a song like that is playing. Maybe that’s why the staff were so friendly? Such a good playlist.
Some spirit to stand simply forth,
and we are happy.

Here again I find myself agreeing with Deirdre LeFaye: it’s a collaboration (see her Family Record). The text is just too sharp (adult) and adept in its pulling out of precisely the most memorable scenes of Pollexfen’s abduction of Harriet Bryon (Vol 1, letter 29); astute observations about human nature from Grandison on a few occasions (and scattered in the original text); strong lines (“I will not be bribed into liking your wit”); and funny ones of the type we find in her Juvenilia: to me who have read Grandison and written a chapter of my dissertation on this book, the best of these is his sister, Charlotte, Lady G, explaining why Sir Charles has hitherto not fallen in love or courted anyone: he hasn’t the time, “for he is constantly going from one place to another. But what for, we cannot tell”. There are lines from from Vol 4, Letters 14 & 15, Vol 6, Letter 43 — could a child get that far?
Yesterday we saw coatis, which are related to wolverines. They look like anteaters, with kind of long faces and a long spider-monkey tail that is striped. There was one in the plaza begging for food, and we saw a group of seventeen plus five babies on the road as we walked out, and we stood still so we wouldn’t scare them.

“I have seen Stephen Hawking at the club more than a handful of times….He arrives with an entourage of nurses and assistants. Last time I saw him he was in the back ‘play area’ laying on a bed fully clothed with two naked women gyrating all over him,” it reported quoting an anonymous source.

So, one of the reasons I don't like the Occupy movement is the lack of a clear message, it seems to be a case of mass whining with no articulation. The other reason I don't like it is how they behave when they get together - it's the kind of thing I'd expect to see from a similarly sized group of baboons.
I have loved this tangerine sweater for years now. It was always the perfect summer business wardrobe staple paired either with white Capri’s or a tan pencil skirt, but I love it with these pants! I think the addition of the scarf helps pull everything together too.

For the sake of thy steadfast love and thy faithfulness. These attributes are closely associated with the covenant. Steadfast love ( חסדך = chêsêd, or hessed, often translated as “mercy,” or “grace”), is a motivation for God to save (Ex 20:6). In Exodus 34:6 the word chêsêd (hessed) is coupled with God’s faithfulness (אמת = ‘emeth)

“And everything you do is right, so who cares?” groaned Davy. He stirred the mess in the pot & thought & finally aimed & shot, “You know, Paragon, when a critter believes he’s better than everybody else around him, I’d say that makes him the most low-down of all.”
The court also noted that the Copyright Act itself grants certain exceptions and an intermediary could avail of the same to escape liability. While this is certainly true, this is also true of the American system wherein valid defences may be made against an infringement claim, and yet, the DMCA grants specific immunity to intermediaries for copyright infringement cases. The court found not only the DMCA, but the WCT and WPPT to be inapplicable to this case, even in terms of persuasive value, which, while understandable to some extent, eliminates even the slightest possibility of ensuring that immunities granted to intermediaries are
**Munich Character? I assume this means Munich Malt? If so, tell the public want Munich Malt tastes like! "German Malt profile?" What is a German malt profile? An Oktoberfest Malt profile? A Dopplebock Malt profile? An Alt malt profile? Helles? Or are we just saying it tastes like German Malts were used? What's the difference in flavor of German malts and American or British or Belgian or other? were German Malts used? Is this beer a Lager? DW

Second, I began eating healthier and getting more exercise. This is not easy because William and I have very different food preferences. So, I’m taking baby steps. Simultaneously, I’m working on bringing more fun and entertainment into my life. I’m brushing up on my chess skills (I currently am so rusty the Tin Man would feel sorry for me) and in line with the exercise, I’m waiting for the weather to break so William and I can play golf at least a couple times a month. Finally, my daughter is coordinating with me on planning more trips for us to visit together.
People like to know that what they purchase has an even greater value due to constricted availability. People pay good money for limited edition prints and first edition hardback books. For ebooks it's more of a challenge but might include special versions with artwork or personal messages and electronically signed copies.

We made the most of the hotel pool and breakfast until we could move in. And Bean-town cracked. us. up. Her personality has exploded. She is blowing kisses, pointing, cruising and saying, "bye bye, mama, dada, ba-ba (bottle) and ni-ni". No doubt a communicator.
But they no longer let you go right up to the stones. Even inside the chain link fence, you are still 25 feet away from the stones.

I feel like I have been in the deepest valley...And today I can say I am thankful for the pain and the fear I first felt...because now, now, I am on the highest mountain and I would not have truly been able to appreciate everything I do now had I not gone through everything I did in the beginning.

We are gathering at The Goat, a cosy wood beamed pub, before going onto our host's home. I recognise a few faces in the group already there, mostly the girls from the gardening club, introductions begin; I play a little game in my head "Guess what they do for a living," Gunsmith, Gumshoe, Goatherd, Grandmother, Greco-Roman Wrestler ... only one is guess is correct.

Like most of you out there I had a fantastic Thanksgiving weekend. Nothing better than spending the time with family, having 5 days off of work, eating great food, it was the perfect Stay-cation. Oh and I can't forget the 78 degree weather that decided to bless us all weekend! For Thanksgiving we went to my grandparents in Long Beach, with most of my immediate family and a few extended family members. My mom took some pictures for Chad and I that I love and will share here soon.
Mind you, this was probably a little more one-sided a boon in favor of Ed Wood than it was for Bela Lugosi who found himself struggling as both an actor and as a drug addict, using this new-found partnership as a means to score some kicks, as it were. Along the way, Bela featured in what would become some rightly (in)famous films that are remembered to this day - even, in some circles moreso than the days when Bela donned a cape and listened to the children of the night.

This week’s episode with a some sort of a confession from Eru-chan. I wonder what it’s about. It can’t be a love confession. Maybe she’ll tell him why she joined in the first place. I really want to know what she’s going to say to him. Maybe I should read the novel.
The date is set for the Liberty Mutual Invitational 12th Annual Scholarship Golf Tournament, benefiting Roseman University of Health Sciences (University of Southern Nevada).

I thought when I was old enough I would understand more, thought the candles on my birthday cake would signify a wisdom denied to the young.
We would head back to Oriole again but perhaps just for coffee and dessert and a nice place to chill.
So - what you have to do is this - cheer up a writer with no party to go to, by suggesting how she can celebrate the publication of a book on the other side of the world. The best suggestion, I will do - with pictures to prove it- so don't make the suggestions grubby please.

Evidently, at least according to the boat captain, it takes 2 years of the puffins to burrow out a little home. These holes have two rooms, one bathroom and one home where they have their babies.
The food was bad.
Anybody who knows me well knows that I am a quasi foodie. I love me some good food so Todd was a sweetie and booked us a reservation at Craft and drove us across town. For you non-foodie people Craft is Tom Colicchio's restaurant, and Tom would be one of the judges on Top Chef (on Bravo) which is one of my favorite shows on t.v. So there we were at Craft, Todd ordered the champagne and wine and I ordered the appetizers and main courses. Todd of course spoke perfect French when ordering the wine...he had me at hello.
Raban.: The multitude being hungry, He creates no new viands, but having taken what the disciples had, He gave thanks. In like manner when He came in the flesh, He preached no other things than what had been foretold, but shewed that the writings of the Law and the Prophets were big with mysteries.

And so, each year, Hartford Democrats will raise taxes. Each year, more businesses will either move or fail to locate here to begin with. State revenues will fall, and the call for higher taxes will continue. This is called a “death-spiral”. Ask Detroit, they know all about it.

I read somewhere once, perhaps in my father’s paper as a child, perhaps in a book a travelling merchant once left behind, that Ankh-Morpork draws to its bosom the lost, the lonely, the hopeful, the deluded, the ambitious. I am lost and lonely.
I've been lusting after all the silk fairy ribbon I see in other peoples' designs, but have never had any. I literally squealed when I saw it! I made a version of the necklace that had the ribbon incorporated but it just didn't look right. I felt like it was out of place somehow. The other problem is that I tried to do that nifty wire-wrapped thing with the ribbon. That's HARDER than it looks! I found this tutorial and tried to use it with ribbon. I've since come to the conclusion that in order for ME to do this, I need a third and possibly a fourth hand. That is going to take some time for me to learn.

That he should stay
I’m not even sure if I remember how, to be honest.
These little squirrels might stay out year round as part of a vignette somewhere in our house--aren't they so cute?!
At loose ends on many days, I spent time trying to revive the faltering redbud, watering it nearly every day and fertilizing it at intervals. It produced some leaves, and I was encouraged to hope for it.
There’s plenty of action, too. I absolutely love the way the film treats the ghostly visions, with Scrooge’s contemporary environment often dissolving to reveal the vision. The best example of this comes with the Ghost of Christmas Present as the floor of their ornate room dissolves to reveal the city of London. The room goes swooping over the city, giving us a wonderful and rich vision of the bright, warm room and the harsh, cold city. As creepy as the human characters can be to look at, the environments look amazing.
So Leveson is redundant, let’s stop it now it’s just getting silly, the press have only done what the government now think was cool and want to do as well and you can’t have a go at someone for doing something first then being in power giving yourself the power to go and do the same thing.

While it may appear to be little more than a “let’s chase after the MacGuffin” tale, “Dragonfire” has a nice twist at its climax that rather makes the whole search feel worthwhile, and it’s a climax that influences and defines a character – maybe even several characters, so whatever problems “Dragonfire” may have, one of them isn’t that

I survived Easter. I didn't do much beyond going to church yesterday. Someone was nice enough to help me with a hotel room for the evening. Which was good since so little was open yesterday and I was very limited to where I go to use a ladies room. So thanks so much for that.

He would rent a screened-in shelter, block out any other campers with curtains, recline in his easy chair—which, embarrassed, he always brought—and just be. He would paint if the urge struck him, he would sketch if he felt like it, he would write in his journal even if he had nothing to say, all the while relishing the sanctity of nature song that is usually blocked out by civilization.
Then I found out that Randee over at Randee's Organized Chaos awarded me The Versatile Blogger award! I am speechless! I love Randee's blog. She is a Mom like me and knows life can get a little chaotic. I always relate to her posts and she makes me laugh. Now I get to give this award to seven of my fellow bloggers and I have to tell you seven facts about myself (you guys are learning a lot about me this week!)

Ah, film noir! It's such a wide-ranging subject that honestly, I've had trouble coming up with a specific topic to write about for this latest blogathon, or at least one that I feel comfortable and authoritative enough to discuss at the moment. Perhaps, then, I'll start with what it is about film noir that fascinates me so much.

The one-armed man in Twin Peaks was originally written in as a throwaway nod to The Fugitive, but when Lynch realized what a great actor Al Strobel was, he enlarged the role greatly and made it (somehow) central to the series’ mythology.
According to a new report, the average American consumes 34 gigabytes and 100,000 words over the course of about 12 hours every day. Nearly half of that time is spent watching television; about a quarter on the computer; and the rest on radio, print media, telephones, computer games, recorded music, movies and other sources. Maybe those average Americans need to go on a word diet. Many of those words are superfluous. (If you consider the inanity of most television shows, radio programs, newspaper and magazine articles, music lyrics, movie scripts, telephone calls, and blog posts — this one included — perhaps most words are superfluous, but for the purposes of this article, I will pretend that word gluttony adds meaning to your life and hence has some value.)
Chose to forgive someone who really hurt me this week and choose to believe it wasn't intentional.
