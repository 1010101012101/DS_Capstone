Art labels are more casual, parties are more fun (think Venetian masks, French films, cancan dancers), and one summer day 3,000 people biked through the museum's entrance concourse for a "Tour de Force" celebration with bike-themed music, films and fashions. Even lectures have been repackaged -- a recent talk about still-life paintings was paired with a food-styling demo.
Reese and Adams said their decisions were difficult, but they're committed to holding officers accountable.

2007-2008, Brazil, United States, Canada, Switzerland, Germany, Mexico, 94 minutes. Gay love makes the world go around in this compilation of seven short films, one of which, "The Postcard," you'll also find in the Gay Asian Shorts program on June 21. Although some of the films were not made available for review, the two standouts are Julián Hernández's "Bramadero," a film whose unabashed depiction of sex may make it seem like a porn film while it's really much more, and Lukas Egger's "Country Life," in which a young gay man from the Swiss sticks meets a party guy from the city. Martin Busker's "HerzHaft" is a disturbing and provocative film about a soccer coach who is having an affair with a 15-year-old player. The message isn't entirely predictably PC.
This is the second big cat rescue in Ohio IFAW has helped fund. In October 2007, two lions and four tigers were rescued from a facility in Gambier and moved to sanctuaries in Florida and Texas.
"EPA remains committed to protecting public health from the dangers of ground-level ozone ... There will be a slight delay in finalizing our decision on any new ozone standards," the statement read.

So why does St. Louis U. basketball struggle to fill a beautiful 10,000-seat arena for home games at a time when the Billikens are having a terrific season that most likely will lead to a spot in the NCAA Tournament? And why is the homecourt atmosphere so lacking in sizzle? I put the question out on my 101 ESPN radio show on Thursday, and here were the most popular answers from STL area sports fans, delivered via text message.
However, state regulations from the 1980s prohibit the township from taking more out of the ground. So much water was then being used that salt water from the Raritan Bay was being pulled underground.
At the beginning, the Hawks looked much quicker and faster than the aging Celtics.

The Hawks twice pushed the margin as high as 19 points and settled for a 49-35 edge at halftime.
Hey, Tony: I believe it is so critical that the Browns trade up for Andrew Luck, that in addition to our top two picks we should add Joe Thomas to the deal. He will be past his prime and/or retired by the time we get an elite QB in here that's worth blocking for, much less take us to the Super Bowl. -- Mike Moore, Erie, Pa.
"That rookie hit me," Jackson said, playfully, then adjusted. "I hit him; I just didn't win it."
Still, until forward Alyssa Thomas leads the Terps to their first Sweet 16 since the Coleman-Toliver era, or until guard Shoni Schimmel carries the Cardinals to another bracket-busting upset, the talk will be about what happened in 2009 and why it might — or might not — materialize again.

Why Maryland? “I'm a family guy, so I wanted to pick a school that's close to my family so my family can come watch me play. I like the coaches and can see myself playing there. Coach Turgeon was a point guard and I'm a point guard. We get along great and he's giving me a lot of tips."

As far as downloadable content goes, "Fifa 12's" add-on “UEFA Euro 2012” leaves plenty to be desired. Released yesterday, the expansion to the hit game suffers from a lack of officially licensed teams, lackluster presentation and no support for online play.

Among the other things we can evidently expect in the season to come: brutal exercise regimens ("people were moaning and crying for mercy"); members of the U.S. Marines Corps showing up to train contestants; and Tina losing her temper about...something.

The syrup's range of fructose content also means it's not necessarily the most logical choice for consumers looking to get away from the fructose levels in high-fructose corn syrup.
Mix a paste of baking soda with equal parts water and vinegar. Apply the paste to the grout and allow to dry. Use a toothbrush with nylon bristles to scrub the paste in a circular motion. Thoroughly rinse the grout and blot with a paper towel to dry. If all of the dirt has not been removed, there are commercial grout and tile cleaners available. I like One Step Cleaner and Resealer because it is nonacidic and reseals the grout as you clean.
Spokeswoman Elia Imler said the three stores are not part of this hiring phase.
The men's basketball team at Lindenwood has received most of the attention to this point in the season, thanks to its impressive 16-2 start, but the women's team also has been busy carving out a respectable record. They've won seven of their last eight games to raise their record to 10-5.

The cool thing about Clover is its ability to send and receive digitized payments to and from other people. It's all smooth as silk: You deposit, say, $25, from a credit card into your Clover account. On a clean and simple home screen, you tap "Pay $" and enter a friend's name, phone number or email address. Enter an amount and short explanation and click Pay. The recipient gets a text or email.

The rest of the two-day meet begins Friday.
I made one of the biggest mistakes of my youth the day I rented a space at a swap meet outside Kennedy Stadium and sold my album collection. My regret is such that in the intervening decades, I have painstakingly reconstituted my vinyl library. But it's not the same: They will always be someone else's albums, having borne witness to someone else's memories, not mine. But it's the best I can do.
With the help of various agencies, she had already gotten her electricity back. By the end of the month, she said, she would be starting trade school through a federal jobs program geared to those in poverty. With that training, she would again qualify for a child care subsidy to return her son to day care. Then, God willing, her boy could come back home for good.

If an architecture student at UCLA or Sci-Arc stepped before a thesis review panel at the end of the school year, announced that his primary goal was to invent "new places" and then unveiled that Bunker Hill fantasia, he'd be roundly called out for wallowing in a peculiar, druggy kind of midcentury nostalgia and sent back to the drawing board. Sorry, to the computer.

The Republican committee members indicated they are leaning toward a contempt citation based on beliefs that the Justice Department had "much greater knowledge of, and involvement in, Fast and Furious than it has previously acknowledged." They said committee interviews, documents and emails show that in one instance, then-ATF Acting Director Kenneth Melson told Assistant Atty. Gen. Lanny Breuer that the ATF wanted to launch a "different approach" for stopping U.S. guns from getting into Mexico, and that Breuer considered it a "terrific idea."

The Electric Daisy Carnival coincides with another major musical event: the Bamboozle, New Jersey's homegrown rock, pop, and hip-hop festival. Last year's Bamboozle was held at MetLife Stadium, but this year, the event has relocated to Asbury Park. Superficially, there wouldn't seem to be much overlap between the Bamboozle audience and the Electric Daisy crowd. BUt last year, Bamboozle made a sharp move toward EDM, enlisting several popular deejays to spin and even turning an area of the festival into a mini-rave. Skrillex, the enfant terrible of American electronic music, is headlining the first night in Asbury Park. One thing is for certain: there's going to be a heck of a lot of booming bass in New Jersey on May 18.
Yet this victory last night, 6-4 over Baltimore in 10 innings at Camden Yards, felt a little different, too. For a team eternally saddled with (and marketing) great expectations, you could sense some relief.
Unlike the Scream and Scary Movie series, The Cabin in the Woods does more than ape familiar tropes for laughs. It asks why we consider the suffering of pretty people entertainment. The film specifically takes on the torture porn of Saw and Hostel, which has thankfully faded in the years since this film was shot.
Delbanco then traces how, in his view, we lost our way. After the Civil War, the vigor of Darwinism eclipsed theology, and the country's rapid modernization led to "a pressing need for expert training" in all sorts of specialized fields. By the 19th century's end, Andrew Carnegie dismissed old-school college as useful only "for life on another planet."
Looking to patch some holes in one of the league's leakiest defenses, Packers general manager Ted Thompson used his first six picks in last month's NFL draft on defensive players.

The plans call for space for artists to live and work on the property.
"It is evident that the cause of the failure was a defective longitudinal seam weld," said the document, which PG&E provided to state regulators investigating how it accounted for weld problems in its system.

"It's uncontrollable, and most of the ad wars are being conducted by groups or forces totally outside of Indiana, who really are using us as a playground to enforce their own clout," Lugar said Monday after the same GOP fundraiser, criticizing outside groups that are spending money in the race even though some are working to help him win a seventh term.

The federal government can withhold highway money if states don't comply.

The Cleveland public school district earns a gold star for supporting this grass-roots effort. When it opens for kindergarten through second grade this fall, Near West Intergenerational School will -- for the first time in Cleveland -- put a charter school in the same building as a traditional school, Cleveland's Garrett Morgan School of Science High School. As Near West adds grade levels, it hopes to move to a bigger building.

Best of all, Branum is never far from his passion. From a desk in the third-floor office at the top floor of his tower, he can see his pottery studio. "Clay work involves being at the right place at the right time," Branum said.
France, which generates more than 80% of its electricity from nuclear, is too deeply committed to the technology to renounce it. In the U.K., public opposition may be better organized, but both the Conservative and Labour parties are committed to supporting nuclear and it will take more than a nuclear disaster to rescue the ratings of the Liberal Democrats, the only one of the major parties to oppose it. Given that the U.K.'s current account (and fiscal position) is under long-term pressure from the depletion of its own fossil fuel reserves, it can hardly afford to refuse any option that allows it to generate domestically.
This year, the main question is how much Obama will take a chance to poke fun at his rival in the presidential race, now-presumed Republican nominee Mitt Romney.

Portland's (fictional) mayor (Kyle MacLachlan), still sitting on the balance ball in his City Hall office, meets with Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein to discuss the citizenry's unhappiness with the police. Portland's real mayor, Sam Adams, reprises his role as an aide, which basically requires him to look rather goofy and nerdy. After pondering whether it might help to spell cops as "kops," like the silent comedy Keystone Kops, the mayor, Fred and Carrie agree on a plan: Fred and Carrie will redesign the Portland police uniforms.

We decided to check into our hotel on the town's outskirts and save a short leg for the next day. On our way into the city that final morning, we slowed to take pictures, to admire the Georgian architecture, to window-shop. But all too soon it was over.

For that bowl, start with a base of white or brown rice, adding wild rice, another whole grain, if desired.

øFace-to-face with the CEO. Maybe it's a long elevator ride, or a chance to chat at a company gathering, but take the opportunity to ask the head honcho questions that will engage him or her. Sobel says the question hated most by CEOs is "So, what keeps you up at night?" He suggests asking something such as "I know we've got a lot of new initiatives going on that just sound great to me. What are you most excited about in going forward?" He also says many top bosses love being asked, "So, how did you get your start?" He suggests steering away from queries about the company's stock price or store expansion, which can be boring for CEOs.
Brown is taking over a program that has revamped its facilities and has lots of top high school talent nearby.

1) Writing regularly is HARD. My initial goal was to write two posts a week. Easy, right? Oh, how naive I was! I didn't realize how challenging it would be to a) find worthy topics; b) figure out what to say about those topics; and c) find the time to actually do it. I now stand in awe of the bloggers I read who manage to put something up once a day. At this point I aim for one post a week, and even that doesn't always happen.

The fabulousness extends to the cuisine. Longo's dedication to high-end farm-to-table cuisine is writ large in the pedigreed foods -- Pat La Frieda, Maytag, Anson Mills, Pacific Farms -- mentioned in almost every dish. Much of the time, it pays off. La Quercia Prosciutto Crudo's ($10 lunch, $12 dinner) silken slices of well-cured ham pair perfectly with nuggets of mellow Parmigiano-Reggiano and peppery arugula salad. Tart and tangy goat cheese from Lucky Penny Farms in Northeast Ohio provides the taste that binds the beautifully balanced flavors of wild mushrooms, coddled egg and crispy prosciutto in the Harvest Salad ($9 lunch and dinner).

On a recent visit, appetizers include a beautiful Keller-inspired salmon rillettes topped with a bright green layer of snipped chives. It's brilliant, truly the salmon equivalent of pork rillettes made with fatty fresh and lightly smoked salmon. There's an earthy herbed farro salad with kernels of sweet corn and avocado, a plate of sumptuous speck served with translucent marinated melon and a dusting of fennel pollen. I like the pasta with ricotta cheese and walnut-mint pesto, though it is somewhat oily and overdressed. Wild king salmon melts in the mouth. We have an order of roasted chicken too, which makes less of an impression than the sides — smashed beets with spiced yogurt and wild arugula or the rounds of fried eggplant with that same dreamy local honey. The chicken is good, but it somehow doesn't get noticed.

Recently, Chicago businessman Matthew Hulsizer struck a deal with the NHL to buy the team and with Glendale for the team to play at the city's arena.

The group contends that taxpayers would be at more risk than Hulsizer. A lawsuit could drag on for months and could lead to the possible relocation of the team.

Then a few others joined him, like Rafael Palmeiro and Sammy Sosa. No others could really dislodge Bonds' infamy, no matter how much his or theirs was fueled by strong speculation or teary-eyed admission. But ever since Roger Clemens 2 1/2 years ago denied before Congress with a national television audience watching that he ever used performance-enhancing drugs, while at the same time his one-time friend and trainer Brian McNamee handed over syringes, gauze pads and empty vials of drugs he claimed belonged to Clemens, Clemens was vying to supplant Bonds place as the face of baseball's biggest cheating scandal. On Thursday, Clemens completed his coup. He became the poster boy for baseball's drug-cheating generation."

Having said all of these things, I must say one more: I didn't laugh much. I don't think the Stooges are funny, although perhaps I might once have. Some of the sight gags were clever, but meh. The three leads did an admirable job of impersonation. I think this might be pretty much the movie Stooges fans were looking for. I have no idea what their children will think about it. I guess what I'm wondering is, was it really necessary?

Rather than pursuing such anti-voter measures, Maryland should focus on continuing to make it easier for citizens to vote. In recent years, the state has provided for early voting and online voter registration. Technological advances, however, have made feasible additional reforms, such as same-day voter registration and permanent absentee ballots. If adopted, these reforms would continue to enhance voters' access to the ballot box and move Maryland in the right direction on electoral issues.

From Obama's standpoint, an adverse ruling could add fresh urgency to his attempts to reenergize dissatisfied elements of his liberal base.

Here's a look at what's on the horizon and who's having a moment in the pop-culture universe. And one more thing. Monkees fans are still the young generation, and we've got something to say: Farewell, Davy Jones, and thanks for being so groovy.

Puerto Morelos does even the most traditional things in its own way. What else would you expect from a town whose defining landmark is a lighthouse that makes the pre-rehab Leaning Tower of Pisa look downright upright?

Ohio's election laws could stand some changes, and HB 194's steps toward using the Internet to register voters and update records would be worth preserving in a new effort.

But in 1976, the lives of Mitt Romney and Benjamin Netanyahu intersected, briefly but indelibly, in the 16th-floor offices of the Boston Consulting Group, where both had been recruited as corporate advisers.

The inclusion of a certain amount of work by European or Latin American artists confounds, since the show feels so geographically and culturally grounded in New York, even if that premise goes unstated. What to make, then, of the presence here of artists as diverse as the cannily Parisian Sophie Calle or the insistently Colombian Doris Salcedo? For better or worse, they're here because art began its transformation into a global enterprise in the '80s. And it's never turned back.

Verdict: One Lakers player insisted to me he's most worried about Dallas. That's because the Mavericks swept the Lakers in the 2011 Western Conference semifinals after the Lakers won the season series 201. I doubt, however, that such a scenario would play out again. The Lakers have played more motivated against Dallas this season, and that surely won't change in the postseason. The team is also fundamentally different without J.J. Barea and Tyson Chandler. Aside from Dirk Nowitzki, the Mavericks aren't that efficient on offense (20th overall).
Bill Suvada, who has lived on Broken Arrow Road since 1973, did receive a reverse 911 call. He loaded artwork and American Indian rugs in a pickup truck and drove his parents, Bill and Marge, who are in their 80s, down the mountain as they fretted about their home.

I'm not troubled by President Obama's slow jam with Jimmy Fallon, who dubbed the commander-in-chief "preezy" during Obama's appearance on late-night TV.

It’s a relief to animal welfare advocates -- and elephants, no doubt -- that the board of the Orange County Fair voted last week to end the 25-year tradition of elephant rides at the annual event. The Santa Ana Zoo announced in December that it too would halt elephant rides, which have nearly vanished as entertainment at institutions accredited by the Assn. of Zoos and Aquariums. The Los Angeles County Fair was urged last year by animal welfare advocates -- and this paper’s editorial page -- to stop elephant rides, although fair officials continued the attraction anyway.

This $399 camera, also called Lytro, can do all this because it is a so-called light-field camera, which is based on a different technology than traditional digital cameras. In simple terms, it uses a modified sensor, plus proprietary software, to capture and process more, and different, information about the light hitting its lens than other cameras do. This includes the direction of light rays. The result is a richer picture file that software, on the camera and on a computer, can use to manipulate images in new ways. Lytro doesn't even classify its camera by the familiar megapixel measure. Instead, the company says it has a resolution of 11 megarays—in other words, it can capture 11 million light rays.

I was a long time coming to this realization, probably because I tend to enjoy cheese at the end of a meal, and I prefer to have sparkling wine at the start. The two rarely crossed paths at my table and, frankly, they still don't. But especially with hard-to-match cheeses such as blues and triple creams, sparkling wine trumps most still wines. If you are not as hidebound in your meal patterns as I am, you can experience the harmonies more often.

Battle stations: Rep. Michele Bachmann's presidential campaign appears to have weathered its first real storm -- prior criticism from the MSNBC crowd that she plays in deep right field doesn't count, since it helps her with the GOP base. This week, the conservative news site Daily Caller reported she suffers from "debilitating" migraine headaches. Bachmann quickly acknowledged her problem, detailed her regimen to control it and trotted out doctors, family members and colleagues to refute the idea that her work has been affected -- a case study in crisis management. But here's what ought to worry her: The story came from unnamed former staffers. Since Bachmann has a reputation -- as do many members of Congress -- for going through lots of staff members, there could be more unflattering stories to come.

The reduced physical demands of T20 make it attractive to the older cricketer. For fading greats of the game, it must look like a relatively pain-free way of prolonging their careers, and of course the generous remuneration doesn't hurt. But for some, it isn't quite working out. It was particularly poignant watching Adam Gilchrist and Sourav Ganguly scratch around at the crease for a handful of runs when Punjab played Pune on April 8. Gilchrist has been in poor form with the bat this tournament, managing just 99 runs in five games at an average of 24 and a strike rate of just 116 - slow in T20, particularly for one of the game's most explosive batsmen. Ganguly's figures are worse: 150 runs in nine games at an average of 16 and a strike rate of 105 (in fact, he has the lowest overall strike rate of any batsman with more than 1,000 runs in the IPL).

That design violated key elements of the 2005 rules. For example, gaps between gamma-test pipes should not exceed 33 inches. In these piles, the pipes were cast 37 inches apart, so less of the pile was tested than required. The rules also call for at least 3 inches of clearance between the test pipe and adjacent rebar, which can alter readings. In this congested design, average clearance was about 2 inches; some testing pipes were surrounded by rebar supports as little as a half-inch away.
