Consider Alex Pope, formerly of the R Bar, who trained with Debbie Gold; or Patrick Ryan, owner of Port Fonda/El Comedor, who worked (and still works) with Howard Hanna. Or Hanna, who was out of plain sight as chef at the River Club and is now in the spotlight at the Rieger Hotel Grill & Exchange. To the casual diner, one day they're toiling mostly anonymously behind the scenes.
Thanks to the Maryland House of Delegates members who voted for Gov.Martin O'Malley's bill to legalize same-sex marriage. It is a fair bill that will allow married same-sex couples and their children to obtain all the civil rights in the state of Maryland that married heterosexual couples and their children currently possess. It will also protect religious institutions from having to perform same-sex marriages if that is against their beliefs. So it is a win-win situation for all concerned.

The Grand Prix is in our rear view mirror, and fans from New York to Georgia seem to have had a good time. The downtown hotels and a few Inner Harbor restaurants got a two-day bump. The city's mayor declared that she gave "Baltimore the opportunity to shine" ("A jubilant finish line for the Grand Prix," Sept. 5). But before declaring victory, lets ask a few questions about the real impact of this event.
Burdick acknowledged from the witness stand that he got police detectives to ask a couple of questions about Somalia and whether their suspect had any interest in returning to the East African nation. Mohamud told police he had no interest in returning to the war-torn homeland he had fled with his family in 1994. But agents already knew Mohamud's background, and his interview provided little they didn't already know.

We meet Katniss on the day of the Reaping, when one boy and one girl from each district are chosen at random to participate in the titular games that pit each child against the others in a fight to death. The event is orchestrated by a game master (Wes Bentley), sanctioned by the country's president (Donald Sutherland) and served up as the ultimate reality TV show by a smarmy, blue-haired host (Stanley Tucci). When her younger sister's name is called, Katniss volunteers to take her place and is swept into a sick game of survival with no rules and no mercy.

15. Mark Wilson, United States -- Having already played 12 tournaments on the PGA Tour this season, Wilson is taking a well deserved two weeks off and will be back for the Wells Fargo Championship next week before heading to the Players Championship. He skipped the Valero Texas Open last week, no real surprise because he has missed the cut in three of his last four appearances in the tournament after finishing solo fourth in 2004. … The 37-year-old Wilson labored on the PGA Tour for a decade before he earned his first victory, in the 2007 Honda Classic. However, in the last few years he has established himself as one of the better players in the game with four victories since late 2009. Mark was one of seven two-time winners on the PGA Tour last season, and his victory at the Humana Challenge early this year has made him one of four players who have won twice on the circuit since the beginning of last year. The others are Luke Donald, Steve Stricker and Bubba Watson -- pretty good company for a guy considered by most to be a journeyman. … Wilson finished 11th on the regular-season FedEx Cup points list last season and is ninth this year. However, the list he is most interested in is the U.S. Ryder Cup points list. He ranks 11th -- the top eight earning automatic berths on the U.S. team for the matches in September at Medinah -- and he will need a strong summer to earn a spot in one of the team events for the first time.

In order to meet the goal, Bolen says, "We have to keep renewing the franchise Oscar has created. What motivates all of us is wanting to make Oscar proud." Bolen is clearly enjoying his current role as brand builder, but when he accepted the CEO position in 2004, it was with some reluctance. "Can you imagine the hornet's nest, coming to work with my wife, and with my wife's family?" But he sensed enormous potential in the brand and decided to come on board. "I was asking questions like, 'Why don't you have freestanding retail stores?' and Oscar would say something along the lines that he was under the impression that it was difficult. So I'd say, 'Why don't we try?' "
In his 2006 re-election battle, which he lost by 18 points, labor unions coalesced around Democrat Bob Casey, but the Philadelphia building and trades group broke ranks and endorsed Santorum because of all the construction jobs hed worked to bring back to the state. Democrat Pat Gillespie, the president of that group, said he almost lost his job over it.
Catholicism. As a cradle Catholic who went to parochial school through eighth grade, I filter life through this background as much as anything. This was seriously challenged in 2007, when the Bishop of Orange, in my opinion, broke his Covenant With the Faithful by not fully disclosing details on a molestation cases, as promised, and by sending a priest to Canada for psychiatric treatment just before he was to testify in a case. That said, I've written with passion and love about several priests I've known - the Revs. McGrath, Burnham and Wadowicz, among others. And there are a couple of active priests in O.C. I would shower the same on were I not afraid of damning them in their bishop's eyes.

These problems will dog him in the general election, assuming he is the nominee. Yet he will have tremendous advantages. The Real Clear Politics average shows that nearly three-quarters of the country believes the nation is “on the wrong track.” Unseating an incumbent president is no easy task, but the electorate is manifestly receptive to the notion.

"Every day he's learning how to play center at the Division I level," coach Brady Hoke said. "I think there's been improvement and some footwork and the things that you look at from a technical side of it. I think he's got to continue -- strength gains are going to be huge for him this off-season, this summer, in the weight room. But I think Jack's made progress. I'd like to find out, I think two of the three (botched) snaps were him and the quarterback, and it's usually a matter of both their faults, but we can't have that."

Normal healthy bone is constantly being renewed through a cycle of dismantling and replacement of bone cells and minerals. Bisphosphonates get incorporated into newly formed bone in place of naturally occurring phosphate, along with calcium. They inhibit the breakdown of bone, thereby favoring the building-up side of the cycle.
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- President Obama's motorcade arrived at the Holborn Avenue (southeast Cleveland) home of William and Endia Eason about 12:20 p.m.
But now that the rhetorical spittle has settled and the anniversary has officially passed, we can stop arguing about whether Obama politicized that mission.
In essence, in every speech, Obama is telling citizens, “Don’t blame me. Blame yourselves for voting in all those Republicans.” He omits to mention that, for three-quarters of the Clinton presidency and all of the Reagan presidency, the House was in the hands of the opposition.
Several legal experts, particularly ones who have experience with military issues, have repeatedly said they expected Stein to be expelled.
USC's calculator is meant to provide only an estimate of what a family might get in need-based aid, says Thomas McWhorter, the school's dean of financial aid.

Airport officials threw in some emergency drills to thicken the plot. They tested everything from police to medical response, including a passenger in cardiac arrest and an unattended bag holding a suspected bomb. It was also dress rehearsal for workers from the Transportation Security Administration, Customs and Border Protection and police and fire departments. Airline employees tested computer systems, operations and procedures.

St. Louis won that chance by default. The NRA had planned to meet that year in Columbus, Ohio, but the Columbus City Council voted to ban assault-type weapons. That's also why it won't patronize the home of the Cubs, the team the Cardinals are hosting this weekend at Busch Stadium.
None of this factors into the plot of "Good Neighbors," nor does it have to, since Jahn's version is crime story as morality play. All the same, it can't help but underlie our reaction to the novel, if only because of the book's relationship to the case. The basic set-up is identical: On March 13, 1964, a 28-year-old bar manager, here named Katrina Marino, drives home through the early morning streets of Kew Gardens, parks where Genovese parked and comes upon her assailant almost instantly. The killer disappears in the middle of the attack, then returns to finish the job. There is a sexual assault. Authorities do finally arrive, only to have the victim die in the ambulance. For Jahn, however, this is less text than subtext — or, more accurately, context — a template against which his larger story can unfold.

By trading out of the second spot, they had little chance to get Richardson, but they still had a shot to get Blackmon, the explosive wide receiver Bradford desperately needs. How much did they want Blackmon? When they found out the Jaguars, who were picking seventh, jumped one spot ahead of them into the Bucs' spot at No. 5, new Rams coach Jeff Fisher reportedly slammed down his glasses and cursed. Jacksonville then took Blackmon.

Although the force is said to be only "lightly armed," it poses a threat to the government because no one knows who's behind them or what their intentions are. Haitians and members of the international community working to rebuild the country are asking whether they represent a force unto themselves more powerful than Mr. Martelly's government.
Santorum has defended himself on the point already, however, saying while he may have disagreed with some of Specters positions, his standing as a top-ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee (and, for a time, its chairman) made him an important figure when it came to confirming Supreme Court appointees. Santorum  who lost his Senate seat in 2006  wanted to make sure former President George W. Bushs picks were confirmed.

It marks a dramatic turnaround from the tense relations of two years ago, when Sarkozy threatened to boycott the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics out of anger about China's treatment of Tibet.
Sure, the Cardinals could have picked off a few more wins. Sure, they could have swept three series to go 3-0 instead of 2-1. But they're also 3-0 in winning the deciding game when a three-game series is tied 1-1. And after losing two consecutive games in sickening fashion last week in Chicago, the Cardinals avoided being swept by capturing the third game.
"It's a fun group to coach," Blossom said. "We were off (Sunday), and we had nine kids up at the gym for two hours shooting.

The second meaning of the term collapse is the possible collapse of the euro zone as an institution, the demise of the euro. To that question, my answer is no, it will not collapse. So much political capital had been invested in its existence and in its role as a "cement" that binds the EU on its way to supra-nationality that in the foreseeable future the euro will surely not be abandoned.

Intellectually, at least. That’s the sense you get from talking to the first-time actor and star of “Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,” in which he plays a 9-year-old boy whose father (Tom Hanks) is killed in the 9/11 attacks.

Tiberi, a member of the GOP whip organization, said many Republicans who opposed the bill had political reasons, like a run for higher office, a contested primary, or a redistricting fight.

And holy crap, the waterworks.

Maybe I should add that my son can be a handful. But, Mike is so good with him. Very attentive, thoughtful, affectionate and sweet. He says he is happy with how things are going but feels that moving in together would be confining to his life. I am struggling to understand this. I feel like he should take responsibility, step up and plan to help with the baby. He says he is not going anywhere but could picture us raising the baby in separate households. I feel humiliated, as if I were not worthy of his commitment. - K.

The point is, had I been driving my car every day, I would have never seen these wayward pets that could have been injured or killed. I would not have met the majority of their owners.

Still in the courts is a separate but related matter. U.S. District Judge David Doty is determining the fate of some $4 billion in broadcast revenue he previously ruled was unfairly secured by the NFL in the last round of contract extensions with the networks to use as leverage in the form of lockout insurance. The players have asked Doty to put that money in escrow and for more than $707 million in damages, too.

The first time I heard Obama speak on this issue was in 2007, when he came to Los Angeles' Crenshaw district to hold a campaign rally. I had watched his celebrated Philadelphia speech at the Democratic convention, the speech that put him on the map of national politics. It was brilliantly delivered but too soft-focus for my taste. But one of the things he said that day in Crenshaw was that voters were rightly fed up with the fact that too many people were in prison. He was partly telling the blacks in the crowd what they wanted to hear, but he was also giving voice to a long-standing racial grievance rarely expressed by any elected officials, much less presidential candidates.

As far as the military balance is concerned, the current time is optimal for an Israeli strike. Since the U.S. left Iraq two months ago, the Iraqi government has no air defense system capable of intercepting Israeli planes flying over Iraq, and the current Iranian air defense system does not appear capable of stopping an Israeli attack. The Iraqi route would be the preferred one for the Israeli air force because it could thereby avoid the lengthy path down the Red Sea and around the Arabian Sea to get to Iran.

"Until now, the principle in this country has been that people's future human capital is their own," said David A. Moss, an economic historian at Harvard University.

He noted that the 2003 and 2005 accidents were not the fault of Metrolink. Although Flatau said that his agency was "not in the business of boosterism," he praised Metrolink for being the first commuter rail agency to purchase train cars with technology to help them better absorb crashes. He also said Metrolink should be credited for trying to cordon off tracks from surrounding streets and neighborhoods.
"He got overly perverted and graphic," Moore said. Or, as court documents put it, "the defendant engaged in graphic description of sexual situations an desires."
Before the technology was available, sculptors had to painstakingly mold each individual puppet's face, limiting the number of expressions they were able to capture. With 3-D printing, thousands of faces can be printed in a fraction of the time. "Coraline" was the first film to use 3-D printing, but at the time Laika's artists had to hand-paint each of the faces, slowing the process and limiting the film's creators to fairly simple details -- not too many freckles, veins or wrinkles, because they take too long to paint.

When planting, the hole does not need to be any deeper than the plant in the pot. Dig the hole wider than the pot, preferably 1�1/2 to twice as wide. Do not dig in wet soil. The soil should be friable, meaning it's crumbly in your hand. If you can make a ball out of it, it's too wet.

I'm reading Gary Shteyngart's dystopian "Super Sad True Love Story" (2010), a fun satire set in the not-too-distant American future, a land of of high tech, low morals, Chinese creditors ready to foreclose on the U.S., in which everyone is busy with their "äpäräti." The äpärät efficiently identifies anyone you're passing on the street or seeing in a cafe or nightclub as a "Low Net Worth Individual" (LNWI) or a "High Net Worth Individual" (HNWI).

Another huge concern of Goldfarb, and the Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology as a whole, is that the public in general does not appreciate the extra risk of multiple birth, common when IVF is employed. Especially when a multiple birth makes headlines, stories invariably gloss over the fact that the vast majority of those babies will have physical or learning disabilities at some level, he said.

Fallon offers Teddy, Margaret's son, a baseball signed by Ty Cobb. When the kid, after some hesitation, takes it, Fallon replaces it with a new one from a stash in his desk drawer. Eli, now the hardest of hard-liners on Jimmy's team, sends in 50 guys with billy clubs and has a couple of them take time from busting strikers' skulls to work over Halloran, a move that looks like it will backfire on him. Teddy lets Nucky know about a little secret they share, something that could effect Eli, and puts the baseball away with a picture of Hans Schroeder.

On Monday, May 19, I led a discussion on "The Brief History of the Dead" by Kevin Brockmeier. I have to say it was the cover that got me interested in this book. You see an open coat with no body in it. There are hands at the sides but no other parts. What an eye-catcher. The first chapter of the novel had appeared in The New Yorker magazine before the book was published in 2006. That chapter describes a world where the recently dead people live as long as they remain in the memories of the living. I had been thinking about Alice Sebold's "The Lovely Bones" but this book has a completely different take on the afterlife. The group discussed what is meant to be dead within the novel. The person just seemed to pick up where they left off. No worries about money, food or clothing. That was confusing to us.

Vitamin D plays a unique role in bone health. It can actually decrease the number of bone-resorbing cells (cells that cause bone loss) and increase the number of bone-forming cells, said Dr. John S. Adams, an endocrinologist and director of UCLA’s Orthopaedic Hospital Research Center and an expert on vitamin D. And its advantage over calcium is that it’s fat soluble and can be stored in the body for later use.

Dear Matthew Hanley: It's impossible to divide movie history into airtight compartments. You can talk about "the silent era," I suppose, because there was a clear-cut end to it (circa 1929). But even within that, there are sub-eras: The earliest documentary-type films, the first story films, then Griffith, then the first features, then the early '20s, then the late '20s. And then, of course, you have the Italians, very important in the 1910s. And the Russians and the French in the 1920s. And don't forget German Expressionism. And how about when eras overlap? Italian neorealism, for example, was happening at the same time as film noir and the Technicolor musicals. In the end, I don't think you can learn this stuff by breaking it into eras and studying them one at a time. I think you can only learn about movies by accident, by liking them and acquiring knowledge without knowing you're doing it. As soon as I know I'm studying something, I forget everything the day after the test.

Two, I never pledge, and I cannot remember a single TV ad I wrote or speech I gave where I said I am going to check in to see if I've got a government-issued telephone. So the way I spend my time is making sure we are achieving the goals I set out in front of the public to do, which is how the schools are going, how is our crime efforts going, are we strengthening our schools, are we preparing ourselves as a city for the future, are we doing the types of things we need to do to put our fiscal house in order. I said those are the three building blocks. I am executing it. I will have a staff person find out the answer to the question.

I know when I came there he'd been in the league for two years and when I first got there, you heard about Junior but when you actually saw him, the youth that he brought out in you was what stood out.
