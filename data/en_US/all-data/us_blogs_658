As much as the delusional expectations of the Europeans about Africa’s potential were formulated and executed by Europeans, so a parallel industry of Black Propaganda contrives to capitalise and exploit the European delusions. The aim seems to have been to demonstrate that Black Africans could compete on equal terms with the European in achievement and creativity. Sadly most of the claims promoted were fabrications, calculated to deceive.
Moe is not generally known for reticence and keeping a low profile. Part of a well-known "struggle" family, he shares the media spotlight with brothers Younis, Shamin (Chippy) and the infamous Schabir.
I also think that the enthusiasm of xenophilia can cause us to overlook the bad qualities inherent in the culture we're obsessed with. Studying a culture doesn't always prepare you for living in it. In particular, if you think everything is going to be as clean as it looks on paper and as rosy as seen from afar, you're in for an unpleasant shock.

Despite my re-organisation of my cling stamps recently, I still can't find a couple of stamp sets... one cling, one clear. It's SO annoying, I really can't imagine where they can be... the sad thing is that I may have put them some where 'safe' and haven't any recollection of it.

When you want to give up, remember that you are often the only one that is stopping you from achieving your goal. The boundaries you are putting up aren’t real. Often, we give up right when things are starting to feel challenging. We don’t hold on long enough to reap the rewards that are around the corner.
Songless and flightless, a bird with no hope,

Now here’s what happens, in a nutshell, during Holy Thursday (at least in the Catholic Church, and my personal parish anyway) liturgy. Mass proceeds as normal until after the Homily. After the Homily, a short prayer is said and then the priest explains that there will be a washing of feet of anyone who wishes to have their feet washed. (My take on this: This is not merely a symbol or just an act to be taken lightly. I am much like St. Peter on this: I am not worthy to have Jesus wash my feet. I realize that everyone else takes this as a symbol much like going to Communion or Eucharist, but I take this seriously and say that I will not have my feet washed until I am ready to follow Jesus wholly and am willing to take a huge step in my faith. I am not ready yet. I pray each year for the strength and courage to do so, but as of yet I have not felt called to have my feet washed. Again, feet washing in my parish is completely voluntary.) In some churches I have been told a select 12 members of the parish have their feet washed and usually it is ushers or other lay people who serve a special role in the Mass. After the washing of feet is completed a special form of Prayers of the Faithful are said; during which the Presentation of the Gifts (including the presentation of the holy oils — which were blest and given out during the Chrism Mass). Mass then continues as normal until just before we would normally have the Dismissal Rite. During this time the remaining Eucharistic hosts are covered and sanctified with incense and a procession of the Eucharistic hosts to a sacred space away from the Sanctuary begins. This also is a time when Latin chants (sometimes in my parish it’s only been English) are sung . The chant (in English) is Down in Adoration Falling. As this is going on, the priest is dressed in a fine garment and a cloak is worn over his shoulders; he never touches the consecrated hosts or bowl. After he and the servers leave the Sanctuary, no closing song is sung, altar society members extinguish the candles in the Sanctuary; around the altar; and the Sanctuary Lamp (“the big red candle”); the altar society members also take everything completely off the altar and it is left bare. The church becomes quiet and everyone is asked to leave in silence. Tomorrow (Good Friday), everyone is asked also to arrive in silence. The Church is now beginning its most solemn time ever and is in mourning.
Today was an awesome day! I spent it with Tricia and Ashley in Ashley's closet.

She was born Roberta Lee Streeter on July 27th 1944 to Portuguese parents in Chickasaw County, Mississippi. Her parents divorced when she was a toddler, and it was left to her grandparents to raise her. They lived on a farm in Chickasaw County - Mississippi Delta country. "We didn't have electricity, and I didn't have many play things," Bobbie recalled. "My Granddaddy liked possum stew, so whenever he caught one, he'd cut off the tail for me to play with."

The Warburgs, Kuhn Loebs, Goldman Sachs, Schiffs and Rothschilds have intermarried into one big happy banking family. The Warburg family- which controls Deutsche Bank and Banque Paribas- tied up with the Rothschilds in 1814 in Hamburg, while Kuhn Loeb powerhouse Jacob Schiff shared quarters with Rothschilds in 1785. Schiff immigrated to America in 1865. He joined forces with Abraham Kuhn and married Solomon Loeb’s daughter. Loeb and Kuhn married each others sisters and the Kuhn Loeb dynasty was consummated. Felix Warburg married Jacob Schiff’s daughter. Two Goldman daughters married two sons of the Sachs family, creating Goldman Sachs. In 1806 Nathan Rothschild married the oldest daughter of Levi Barent Cohen, a leading financier in London. The Cohen family was now part of the club.
Leave to get cold. As the jars are cooling you will hear a popping sound , this is the top sucking in, your sign the jar has sealed and is airtight. If you don't get this, and to be honest I didn't with one jar the first time simply repeat the 5 minute simmer step. I realised after the first fail it was because I had not twisted the cap on tightly, simmering to get an airtight seal on a jar you have not closed properly is an exercise in futility....

The engine may let the vehicle down a little but the interior and list of standard features more than makes up for it. The boot, for instance, is one of the biggest and easily swallows up suitcases and golf clubs. The cabin itself is spacious and rather comfortable.

When Pitcher and the scout were within a few feet of the shack, an elderly man emerged from the front door and stood on the porch. His hair was curly and mostly gray with a few sprinkles of black. He wore a light-colored, long-sleeve cotton work shirt and gray striped overalls. The U.N. scout sized up the man and guessed his age at near 80. He appeared to be in excellent condition for an octogenarian, however. The scout continued to be amazed at the health of this group of people living in the swamp without support from their government.
He doesn’t need to receive anything, the offence being complete merely by the making of the request.

Use slow, deliberate strokes. Try to be precise at the center of each triangle, because there is no good way to conceal mistakes there. Also, try to be precise when attaching your lines to the dots in the grid because there are a lot of lines converging there.

Sometimes, you meet someone so fucked up that it offers perspective on how fucked you are yourself. That’s alright, it’s a good thing. Everything’s relative. I’ve met these people with frightening frequency all my life, disregard what reflection that casts on the friends I make or the life I live. You were never like that. I saw how messed up I was in contrast to how perfect you were. Are. I don’t know anymore, sometimes I worry if what I idealize in you was just a mirage that my subconscious cooked up to make living tolerable, but even the hope that it was reality warrants this. Perhaps you weren’t perfect. Perhaps you were as flawed as I was, but the hope that you were perfect for me warrants this.

The Summer My Life Began wasn't what I expected. I thought it would be a perfect summer read; light, nice and highly enjoyable. But while it was nice, it lacked the depth I seek in my reads. It felt like things were too good to be true. In this book everything was nice, everyone was always happy and excited. To the point that when there was some "trouble", it felt too forced and uncharacteristic and out of the blue.

Themes & Things: The story of being the new kid in school is, of course, a classic theme. However, I really liked the aspect of the story that deals with creativity, self-examination, and learning to let yourself be YOU, foibles and all; and the emphasis on the fact that true friends will forgive you your faults and boo-boos. I even think that part could have been developed more, though it probably didn't quite fit in the scope of the book. Still, I couldn't help wondering more about the context of the story—where did Jules and her friends fit in at their school, in a larger sense? Were they misfits? Well-liked? I suppose in a way the point is that it doesn't matter how they fit in at school because they're comfortable in their own skin and with one another...and they're helping Paige learn to feel comfortable, too.
On the other hand, most people only know what they hear about on the TV news or read in the papers. This wouldn’t be a problem if the media covered ALL aspects of traffic safety evenly or comprehensively, but they don’t. Media outlets are paid to make a profit through high ratings which sell advertising space. The very best way to “make the news” is to start with the truth and then sensationalize how it’s delivered. I’m not suggesting that newsmakers misinform, but I believe that they do put a spin on how they tell their stories to make them engaging and enthralling. This leads to the public becoming hyper-focused about a tiny slice of what’s really going on in the world of traffic safety. Again, the media reported stories are accurate, but don’t show the “whole picture” – they’re often out of context.

Why two stores? The reason is simple: one store may not offer you everything you need and want.

In reality, such a duality has never existed as a description of the whole of society. In Britain, until the beginning of the 19th Century the majority of workers retained some link to the land, for instance, and were able to supplement their wages with the ability to provide some of their needs directly for themselves. All industrial revolutions are marked in their initial stages by relatively high levels of social mobility. In Capital, Marx describes some of the initial industrial Capitalists, who began themselves as workers. In Europe, the link with the land, in places like Germany, remained well into the 20th Century. In the Communist Manifesto, Marx himself refers to the intermediate classes, but these are presented as being only temporary as a few workers rise up, whilst some Capitalists are cast down. Its only in Capital that we begin to get the kind of economic analysis of the likely trajectory of Capitalist Production, in which Marx begins to identify the growth of a more permanent middle strata of officials and functionaries who arise due to the increasing removal of the Capitalist from an active role in production, and the passing of that role to professional managers, and with increasingly technological production the need for an increasing group of technical experts and administrators.

Being rich means having lots and lots of money, possessions, and blowing that money each and everyday because after all…its an endless supply! WRONG! Being rich is none of those things, in fact many wealthy people are more depressed than people who have no money at all! Being rich means to have a sense of self fulfillment. You have to be 100% satisfied with your life, you have to have exactly what you want and with no empty spaces to fill…but that is impossible! Actually, it’s not.

But it isn’t. And you might think it would be brightest when it is closest to us – but then it’s just a thin crescent that we see, so it isn’t. Actually, there’s a compromise position about one third of the way through May 2012 when it is both a crescent – less than 20% of the disc illuminated – and near it’s brightest at magnitude -4.7. After that it gets to be a larger crescent, but it also dims some because so little of the disk is lit. Still, even at the end of the month with just one percent illuminated it is shining at a dazzling - 4.1.

As I think of it, limiting the scope of what the players can access, when they can access it and how the can access it, is far more of a campaign element than what rule system you're using. If plate armor is something that only the highly skilled can create, then towns and villages won't have it. If players are looking for magic items, they have to hunt down rumors of such and hope that the gods are kind to their request when they hear of haunted ruins where an ancient elf crafted drifted in madness but may, mind you may, just have something similar to what the seeker wants.
The costs to an author to purchase any of the books are again pretty straight forward. For a 200 – 300 average page paperback book, selling at $14 – 16; the author gets 80%. That is, 80% of the list price less the print cost and a 10% taking by Aventine. That, again, averaging about $5+ per book. Regarding royalties for the author; it is the list price minus the print cost and the additional amount a third party seller like say Amazon might take; that can be anything up to 55%. With Aventine, the books, by most standards, are competitively priced because Aventine has not chosen to inflate the costs of book production and printing. The profits are actually small for them. In fact, so far, I don’t know another author solutions service that comes to mind making so little on the books they publish. On this note; if you are thinking of going with Aventine, be aware; they do not have an online bookstore. All your books will be sold through third-party sales.

Reality only very slowly began to penetrate their consciousness when Jesus offers proof of his resurrection. He shows them the wounds on his hands, his feet, and his side. Jesus even allowed them to touch him. He breaks bread with them and eats with them. And only then could they admit to themselves what had seemed absolutely impossible – the one who had truly died had truly risen! The Crucified now stood before them as their Risen, glorious, triumphant Lord.

I also didn't want to have to use a whole bunch of pots and pans or prep tools cause, quite honestly, my kitchen looks like a pigsty right now and pretty much everything is dirty (I'm working on it!). So, a one pot chicken meal it was.

Monday: I doubt there's a colour more suited to the neutral-lid-with-a-pop-of-colour-on-the-lower-lashline look than Urban Decay Flipside Eyeshadow. Mine came in the Get Baked Palette, which is basically an ode to that kind of look! I haven't used Flipside in a while, so I decided to use it on Monday. I wore Urban Decay Half Baked on the lid and crease, deepened the crease with Twice Baked, and added Flipside on the lower lashline over a layer of NYX Electric Blue Eyeliner.

I don't know how the divide-to-conquer process can be turned against our political class. Coalition majorities are unstable, owing to the voting power of marginal blocs in a bare-majority coalition, but the political riposte is to form a new coalition by enlisting new blocs to replace the querulous ones, or better yet, to use the prospect of being outside a potential new majority to quell any embryonic uprising. Note how hoary this tactic is: Federalist Alexander Hamilton used it to persuade New York to join in ratifying the Constitution.

We're naming our baby Ivey. He'll have a given name and if he so chooses to go by Harry, then he can go by Harry. Nothing and no one would stop him. But, do I think he'll be made fun of with the name Ivey? No. In fact, I think he'd be made fun of with the name Harry (hairy) Lemon. But, honestly, these days kids are made fun of for the color shirt they're wearing. I can't shelter Delia or Ivey and put them in a bubble. I just hope and pray we'll raise them to brush off teasing and never push it forward. Judgement doesn't really get you anywhere, afterall.

Speaking of great performances from Jimmy Stewart, I had nearly a carbon copy internal conflict over the fantastic Rear Window. Stewart was again wonderful, this time as a curious but helpless man stranded in his apartment, only able to watch a murderous plot unfold through his telescope, powerless to do anything about it. In the end, though, even more than Vertigo, Rear Window was just too clearly a psychological thriller to make it on this list.

I believe it is referring to the time when the Chretien Liberals increased the number of points an immigrant needed to immigrate to Canada as a way to reduce the backlog in one fell swoop by disqualifying an increased percentage of applicants. Threatened legal action stopped that and the madness continued, the backlog kept growing, and we Canadians were basically told by non-citizens that we have no legal right to control our border.

The whole time we were making moving arrangements all we heard about was Wegmans. "Wegmans is amazing... best grocery store on the planet... Oh, you'll love Wegmans! Wait till you see Wegmans..." and so on. It was quite fitting that we saw about 5 trucks as we were entering the city limits. And yes, it does rock that much. I could do a whole post on Wegmans. There is a whole aisle dedicated to rice dispencers. The beer section is the size of a CVS. They have bulk foods... Organic food... Prepared food...

It's a quote from The Sound of Music, where the Mother Superior of Maria's convent is telling her that there are many ways to serve God, so when one path is closed, it doesn't mean you can't continue on your journey. I thought about that on Friday when I was talking to a booze analyst about the imported beer market. It's for a story I'm doing for Cheers, so I won't get into the numbers, but I don't think it's a surprise to anyone that exchange rates are hiking the U.S. price of most imported beers.

“To sanctify something means to separate and prepare it that it may be presented and offered to God. This is more precisely defined in the conception of sacrifice. The exhortation which is grounded upon the mercies of God and is directed towards men is summed up in the demand that men should present their bodies—that is, their concrete, observable, historical existence—as a sacrifice. Now, sacrifice means surrender; it means an unconditional gift; it means the renunciation of men in favour of God. If men are themselves the object to be surrendered, renounced, and given up, their sacrifice can mean nothing less than the relentless acknowledgement of that questionableness and confiscation which occurs when they are confronted by the unfathomable God; the sacrifice which they have to offer by means of an ever-renewed, but never completed, return to His mercy and freedom…”—431, Barth, Romans
In any case, she doesn't seem to have slavishly followed Browning and Waldemar Young's script: Her novel features at least one character, a certain Colonel Yates, who doesn't appear in the movie's cast list on IMDB.

I've had this pattern (Simplicity 2900) since early last year but hadn't had a chance to use it. I love layette, I love pretty layette and what attracted me to this particular patter was that it was vintage. It is a reprinted vintage Simplicity pattern and it's so cute. It is the quintessential Cuban layette, which apparently got stuck in the 1950s. I don't know when what we know as Cuban layette came to be but I'm pretty sure it must have been around this time. Of course, I'm only speculating here, I can't say I have ever actually given this much thought before now.

The mention of Jesus of Nazareth back in verse 8 was not offensive. Nor does the mention of Jesus offend many today. To say “Jesus is Lord” would be more offensive.

Before you start wondering about the sanitation of something like this, along with the potentially life-ruining post-party cleanup, I need to explain. You wrap your table in Saran Wrap. Tape it down underneath. This offers two benefits: one, people aren’t literally scooping up bean dip straight off your table and two, when the party is over, you roll the Saran Wrap up, throw it away, and wipe down your table. That’s my kind of clean-up.

At the back of most people’s minds there was a voice whispering, “At this price, how can I go wrong?” To hesitate would be to miss out on your own personalised Bulgarian vision. This feeling spurred on the buyers, and many agents I’ve met certainly did nothing to dispel the dream. In the mid 2000′s, the rural Bulgarian property market seemed to be entirely driven by panic. Panic that prices would rise, panic that someone would get in before you, and the panic that you wouldn’t find anything during your two-week trip.

We went back in and I took a few moments to take a gander at Levon's shiny yet exactingly-worn drums. I was a drummer and singer, too, with my band UberEasy back in Atlanta. But I played just congas, bongos, and hand percussion. Wandering around Levon's high-ceilinged great room, I noticed sets of hand percussion that were labeled "Amy," whom I later discovered was Levon's only child. I took a moment to play these instruments, but I was careful not to disturb them too much. I looked back up at this house's amazing structure, with the rich smell of its wood in my nose, and decided I needed to join my friends.
Little did I know that I was never meant for real men or real love in the real world. Fiction is the feast I should have stayed with instead of the battleground of insane relationships, but I’m glad I had all the sex, and added to the population. The wisdom I gained far outweighs that of the 50yr marriages – no, once is definitely not enough. Fantasy men, especially surgeons, US Marshals and wizards, are knocking on my window at all hours of the day and night…honest to God. And, I can read with my eyes shut. Yes, there are voices in my head – only because they’re part of an audio book, of course. The surgeons are mainly on TV so I have to make the effort there.

It’s the sign of a well managed and skilfully operated pub that the staff and punters are all so obviously enjoying themselves. A Murray’s Punch & Judy had us smiling profusely as one of the barmen told us to help ourselves to a comfy chair in the dining area as he removed the DINING ONLY sign. Nice touch, that. And very comfy chairs we discovered as we lowered ourselves down slowly, becoming aware as we were of the fact that we are getting old and had walked quite a bit further than we have for some years.

Surprisingly, it was not all that bad. It was actually somewhat moist in the middle. The outside was very dry though. I really did taste like cardboard at the end. Yes, I’ve chewed cardboard before. No, don’t ask as it’s another story for another time. lol. Anyway, I will say that I think 99.9% of the pound cake I’ve eaten in my life tastes like cardboard to me. So, take this with a grain of salt. The pumpkin flavor isn’t half bad though.
Ajax is a popular technique for creating highly interactive websites and web applications. It is based on polling over an HTTP connection; and often involves a client regularly polling a server to see if it has any updates for it. This is a well–known technique, and I won’t attempt to cover exactly how this is done, as there are lots of JavaScript libraries out there to help.
Now, it's Diddy's last TOTP, surely there's some sort of running motif with his presenting that they could squeeze one more out of... and sure enough two girls turn up wearing T-shirts which appear to depict a stylised drawing of Arnold and a radio dial and the legend underneath 'thanks to the TONY BLACKBURN SHOW'. So yes of course they're the Tony Blackburn fan club who've "just had their annual meeting in the phone box round the corner", introducing "Tony's theme song". Never fails us, Diddy. Then they join him in pointing off into the imagined stage distance! At this point Diddy became self-aware and had to go. De Paul and Moran's Eurovision song was last time performed back to back. This week a neat overhead shot revealed the two grand pianos almost slotting into Tetris-like place with the players facing each other, De Paul reading her 'ROCK BOTTOM' headlined newspaper. She's working confused gesticulations with which to start too, as the director hurredly switches between a camera behind both protagonists. De Paul then throws the paper over her shoulder only for it to apologetically fall right behind her, something that she apparently finds so hilarious she nearly corpses through her next two lines. Retake, surely? Meanwhile whatever the crowd are dancing to has a progressively faster pace. Two of them occasionally wave Union Jack flags. Two of them. Put the effort in, floor manager.

I’m starting a new teaching job in the fall, my first gig out of the house in a long time, and finding time to write will be more challenging. I’m not that worried though, because I feel like parenting has taught me more about using my time well more than anything else has. It makes me think of the movie Limitless. Bradley Cooper plays a character who discovers a pill that allows you to use a hundred percent of your brain. I had this thought when I saw it: Pill?

Against these, he desires a cohesive, homogenous, public-spirited society, where individual freedom is the freedom to obey the laws, where people’s primitive tendency to do what they like is re-moulded into a love of duty and custom.

Things started slowly with a core group of volunteers to help with training runs (2009), and frankly, sometimes there were more volunteers than participants at the twice weekly training sessions. Participants who needed shoes or proper running gear were provided these things from a stock gathered from friends in the running community. Water and light snacks were always available after the session. The First Annual Run for Change 5K only had 25 participants. The ‘Second Annual’ essentially doubled the number and the Third Annual Run for Change 5K Fun Run (Aug 18) is hoping to see the numbers double again. The event is free; everyone gets a shirt and finisher medal, as well as, nutritious and fun post-run refreshments.

The Western Church has failed big time when it comes to the affairs of the poor. In fact, just yesterday I was driving home for the grocery store when I passed a man holding a beat up piece of cardboard on which was scrawled “Hungry. Please Help. God Bless.” I drove by him and did not give it a second thought. As I passed him he looked at me and immediately averted his eyes when they met mine. As if he was ashamed of his current occupation on the side of the road. What is amazing is that when he averted his eyes I did the same thing. I felt ashamed of what I was doing. I was driving by a man who has nothing.I was in a car carrying food that I did not really need and yet I could not spare a dollar or two for a man that was hungry. But I went even one step further in my hypocrisy, as I drove by this man I prayed that God would bring someone along to help him and show him the Gospel. I prayed for someone to help this man AS I DROVE BY HIM. It was after this experience (last night) that I read James 2 (this morning), needless to say I felt convicted.
I don’t see the point in drowning you with terrifying statistics. It’s never the numbers around poverty, pollution and the like that bum me out the most anyway. It’s the fact that in a ‘free’ society, so many people are fundamentally and purposefully ignorant. Until a significant proportion of the population becomes more realistic about the kind of life this planet can support, governments and corporations will continue to turn whatever they can into commodities. Even things that have no real value whatsoever. Like pollution, for example. How insane is it that you can buy the right to emit carbon dioxide? Imagine what their appetite for water will be when we really start to run out.

But, if I had five years, I would spend them writing and travelling.

I might even revisit Stratford and look up Will Shakespeare or re-read Dickens in entirety.

Wholeness: If I were writing and recording an album of music, I could achieve a sense of wholeness by having a structure to the album. In classical music, this would be some recognised form, such as a symphony or concerto form. In modern music, a concept album might fit the bill, as would a collection of music that takes the listener on some kind of journey, with a detectable beginning, middle and end. Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, as an album, deals with everyday life, for example. Pink Floyd’s track “Echoes” from the album Meddle, also has a recognisable structure. In painting, I might choose to employ some sort of colour unity by limiting my palette or choosing a recognised colour scheme (see: How To Choose Colours). As a novelist, plots, sub-plots and story arcs for different characters is how I might achieve this B-value. If I were developing a web application, the information architecture would hold the wholeness.

I began to worry again later that night, this time about colors. I didn't see many of the colors on the walls at Outlaw Johnny's that were the colors I wanted. Matter of fact, the only place you could see the colors that touch my heart were in the desert, and the sunset. Early in the morning I called, and Johnny reassured me I could get the colors I wanted. But how to describe them? At the last minute, I grabbed some rocks in various shades of red and orange and gold from the wooden bowl on my dashboard.
They jumped on a band wagon of a story and added their views and wild insinuations and increased the tensions themselves. The tensions were not directed at the man himself.

I fear that nothing can save the Republic now. Next comes the end game, where the decayed remnants of the Constitution assume new forms and our rulers consolidate their power. This includes marginalizing the useful idiots that made their quiet coup possible.

EMS gets a call that an elderly man has had a seizure and is now unconscious. When they get to the scene the man's wife is freaking out. With a little effort, but the paramedic rouses the old guy. He's fine. Turns out he and his wife were having sex for the first time in 15 years - thanks to Viagra or Cialis I assume - then he sat up too quickly and briefly passed out. Even after a decade and a half, it still seems like his wife should be able to tell the difference between a seizure and an orgasm.
Both albums are available as digital downloads for a measly $8 a piece from The Angry Snowmans' Bandcamp.com site; physical copies are also available from the band themselves (I picked up the debut on CD and What We Do Is Festive on Christmas-y red vinyl - score!).

I've been very hesitant to point to specific people or acts for which I was grateful since the Bean was born. I feel I must, however, just share one or two people or bits of service that were especially helpful. I hope this isn't taken to demean or lessen the gratitude I feel for all of the faith and prayers and acts of service we received. Please know we couldn't have survived this without them all.
Small Tin roof homes stretch out over the water perpetuated by the bond of generation after generation of Chinese families. Initially constructed to house the port laborers in the 1800′s, six clans remain and still maintain a life style of working in George Town and living off the sea.
Well there are some huge changes about to happen here in the little Husband family. We have lived here for 19yrs and in that time Grants job has changed from a pure reptile keeping one to a reptile and small mammal keeper. He has had some struggles with co workers too over the last few years and so I encouraged him to seek a job else where. SSSsooo Grant applied for a got a job as a reptile keeper in Adeliade zoo. He will start around the 10th of June. Tim(16) and I will pack up and leave a month after Grant during the mid term school break. There is alot to organize and my head has been swiming with how to get it all done. We will live with oldest daughter Carlia at first in Adelaide while we find a place of our own. I doubt I shall get much creating done in the mean time. I do hope to finish some etched metal projects I have on my desk before I pack the art room up tho. In just over a week I shall be doing classes with Finnabair as well and I am sssooo looking forward to that. I think not long after that I shall have to box up all me stash for the move.
I forgive myself for not realizing and seeing that the urge and desire I experience/have within myself for /towards relationship and sex is directly connected to the value/importance that this world/society has placed on sex and relationship which is able to be measured by and through money as money is the substance through which value is equated within our world/society.

By the time Andrew McMahon and company hit the stage, the audience was impatient and many of them intoxicated; such is the danger of a three-hour gap between doors and the headliner set. Luckily, Jack’s Mannequin delivers songs that mesh well with a happy, drunk crowd, and they did not fail to deliver, slamming their way through 100 minutes of hits and new songs perfectly arranged to keep momentum. It didn’t matter if you cared for or had even heard the new album; songs were dropped neatly between fan favourites and hits, which kept the “I’m too cool for anything after Everything In Transit” fans in check. These fans do exist, but are the definite minority, which is a good thing, since I feel Andrew has finally created a sound completely distinct from Something Corporate.

You are reaching the last option given above at this current point as the depth of the time and space that has been moved through is so very vast in relation to how to the original plan was to pan out, and the moving of humanity and of the surface of Gaia into extremely pure states of consciousness is now being met as you reach the many crucial and important dates and months along your Cosmic and planetary calendars that see the beginning physical changes first such as disclosure, physical Earth changes and the giving of advanced technologies, and then the more spiritual and esoteric and mind boggling aspects which are to take place after such physical events.
In the label's heyday of the 1960s, her fashions were worn by Jackie Kennedy and members of the Kennedy family, as well as Vanderbilts and Rockefellers. The look said, "Leisure class, preppy, country club, cocktails by the pool." It was establishment, but very funky and slightly eccentric establishment.
When it came to the Moynihan Station project, which could involve a new rail station in the Farley Post Office, the relocation of Madison Square Garden, and new office towers and retail over the current Penn Station/MSG site, Brodsky had the same basic questions. “How do I know how the public investment should be made versus private--what’s the rule?” he asked.
In order to put an end to the barriers of segregation and discrimination based on gender, race, and class oppression, GGE takes a dual approach of community organizing and service provision. GGE mobilizes 600 NYC boys and girls ages 8-19, women and men under Title IX of the Education Amendment and its ten points, to work as a collective toward systemic change in all of the support networks that shape the development and achievement of girls and women. Concurrently, we nurture the optimal development of girls, women and, ultimately, the entire community through a variety of programs and projects.
Why didn’t others help Paul? They were not spiritually minded. An example of this mindedness is in Philippians 2:4. “Look not every one on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.” Then he cites the example in verse 5. “Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.”
The journey that we started 6 years ago TODAY changed our lives... there were really, really bad and dark times... but there were also very uplifting, loving, and hysterically funny times. There were moments that we didn't think it could get any worse, followed almost immediatly by a wink, or a gentle hand squeeze, or the look that Jeff and I give each other when nobody else exists in the world... it is just us... together... in perfect love... knowing that things would be alright.
How did this look from Cuba’s perspective? Well, imagine that at the end of the American Revolution the French had decided to remain here. Imagine that the French had refused to allow Washington and his army to attend the armistice at Yorktown. Imagine that they had denied the Continental Congress a seat at the Treaty of Paris, prohibited expropriation of Tory property, occupied New York Harbor, dispatched troops to quash Shays’ and other rebellions and then immigrated to the colonies in droves, snatching up the most valuable land.
It’s been said that there aren’t enough places for kids to hang out in this community. I suppose that for many parents, Starbucks sounds like a good option. It’s well-lit, centrally located, and full of non-threatening adults. It does little to stimulate the curiosity of young minds, but it’s a wholesome enough place for them to pass the time.
In his broadcast to the nation, Mr Chamberlain spoke of his sadness that “the long struggle to win peace” had failed.
Jack gets tired and it seems (to him...then to me) that the world is going to end! He starts off REALLY whiny. Which then usually quickly escalates to crying. Which THEN turns into full on sobbing, not being able to understand him, snot pouring, tears streaming, on the verge of puking, can't stand up because his "legs aren't working" blowout meltdown! Why? Oh, because I am a jerk of a mother who gave him Dasani water instead of the Brita pitcher water. I even poured it in a cup! Nope. Not gonna have it!

It’s been awhile since I’ve blogged, it’s been over 4 weeks in fact. In the past time would pass and I’d think of it in terms of a “few” weeks or a “couple” of days. But once a baby is introduced into your life you start counting time much more specifically – it has been exactly 4 weeks and 1 day since Brayden Thomas was born. Therefore, it has been over 4 weeks since I’ve exercised the blogging parts of my brain. It feels good to be back! (It also feels good to have a happy, peaceful, sleeping baby next to me).
Not a man of convention or pride, Mattias drew his sword, grabbed his pistol, and joined in the war cry of The Butcher from below.

And the most distinguished 20th century Australian conservative surely deserves at least a brief mention. Sir Robert Menzies was Australia's longest serving Prime Minister (in the 1950s and 60s) and is noted for how few his "initiatives" were over all that time -- a truly heroic achievement for any politician, given the temptations to meddle and the pressures to "do something" that come at governments from all sides. Here is one excerpt from his thinking:

One of the best things in a pub is to hear that lively buzz of people enjoying themselves over a tipple or three. It isn't just CAMRA members that take pleasure in cheery conversation unhindered by inappropriate music, played at nearly full toss. Is it really so wrong just to want to chat or ponder quietly? While background music can and does enhance from time to time, if you have to shout above it, it ceases to be background.

Suddenly a pigeon landed on the rail, then another, then another. Fast and furious they came, wings whirling in the snowstorm, until the rail was heaving with swaying bird shapes. Glorianna opened her mouth to speak, but then shut it again. The sparrows had started to arrive now, squeezing between the pigeons, chirping and squabbling, fighting like the warriors they were. Her visitor laid his hurt hands on her shoulders. She felt their warmth, like healing honey dripping into her bones. She closed her eyes, drinking it in. Then she opened them again, as she heard a muffled miaow.

Ah well. I cannot complain: there are worse fates, and worse sentences, and I have never loved the holidays. I shouldn’t complain: I am not the one detained, nor subject here to the cruel exclusions of alienage. Still, I miss him, and still I worry, and still I do not understand how the roulette of birthplace can render one subject to such bland and flabby injustice. Immigrant detention is ostensibly an administrative necessity, and not meant to be punitive, but I cannot conceive of being locked for over a month in a room with no daylight as anything but punishment.

The reported t-values indicate a pretty large standard deviation attached to each of the computed coefficients in this formula (just divide the estimated coefficients by their corresponding t-values below) Not to mention the fact that inflation and short-term interest rates tend to make the model dependent on contingent data, hence the relatively high R², though it comes at the expenses of a long-term, structural explanation of how households smooth their consumption across time and variations in income.

And while doing something may have no effect at first, we are only three days in and already the SHOP TESCO TRICKS Twitter page has 27 followers.
It is an appalling state of affairs that today the South African ruling party in this country actively endorses and promotes the image that the “Apartheid Regime” was defeated in military battles. These arrogant Marxists (bastards) have completely forgotten that it was the leaders of the United States and their own buddies in Moscow who decided that Cuban troops will be withdrawn from Angola, and Soviet military aid would cease, as soon as South Africa withdrew from Namibia. South Africa also agreed to hand control of Namibia to the United Nations after a tripartite agreement was signed between Angola, Cuba and South Africa. How does one hand control of a country over to someone else if you didn’t occupy it in the first place?

Honestly, I don’t know if Don is madly in love with Megan or if he is just completely, head over heels in lust. She makes him crazy. He is already an old man at forty (imagine a sixty year old today and he would probably be in better shape than Don is). Don drinks too much, plays too hard, eats poorly and never exercises. If Megan wants to keep him around (which seems debatable at times), she should really take him out to the park for some fresh air, sunshine, and a few laps around the reservoir. Sex alone is not going to keep him young, no matter how often they do it (and they are not at all in the same league as Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele).

This dresser has been around for quite awhile. It was actually purchased by my mom who intended on refinishing it herself about ten years ago. It has been sitting in her garage ever since. I recently purchased a new house and asked my mom if it would be okay to use this piece as my first project--I knew it would look great in my daughter's room. It had really nice detail and I wanted to give her a piece of furniture with a story behind it.
While the majority of this novel may play out like a potboiler romance, as Barbara scatters her interests and affections from sea to shining sea, don't be fooled.

These things make me happy, these things make me grateful to be here, to be alive, so these are the things that are going to fill my life right now.

Something unusual happened in October 1956. Frankie Lane released a cover of Tennessee Ernie Ford's Sixteen Tons single in England. It sold 400,000 copies in ten days. In two months, it's had sold two million copies. It's not surprising that Lane, with his cowboy music theme songs, was successful with Ford's tune. After all, Sixteen Tons wasn't Ford's first big hit (The Ballad of Davy Crockett was). But despite Lane's record setting sales success, the song is indelibly linked to "Tennessee" Ernie Ford.

Dante is called in to work on his day off but must deal with one problem after another, most of which are personal. This film also introduced the duo of Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith) to the world.

It (what is “it?” is it grief? pain? sadness?) washes over and through and around me, surrounds me and sucks me down; drowning me in a bottomless sea of sadness and loneliness! I hate my job, I love my job; I hate New York; I love New York; I miss my family; I don’t want anything to do with my family - all they do is die and get sick or make me feel bad that I can’t (won’t) do more for them. I have no one to talk to, not that I WANT to talk to anyone, no one to listen to me, not that I have anything to say. No where to pour my heart and soul and fears and tears and whines and complaints, and the few small joys when they dare to raise their little heads, as if I would be able to vocalize or physicalize them, as if there really was a heart or soul alive in me anymore and the longer I go, the deader I feel...walking into a frozen fjord, growing number and colder with every step. No one to slap me out of this silly little mood, if that is what I need, nothing to physically, mentally divert my attentions...I have never felt so isolated and lost and small.

The Pet Rescue Mysteries started in March with BEAGLEMANIA. It begins at a puppy mill rescue, where Lauren meets her love interest, Captain Matt Kingston of Los Angeles Animal Services. He’s a great contact to have, since he keeps Lauren notified of animals in need of rescuing before being put down by the public shelter. The next one will be HOUNDS ABOUND, which will be published in April 2012. It features a very special pet rescue facility that takes in hard-to-adopt animals such as the disabled and seniors.
The word karma refers to prescribed duties. The word vikarma refers to activities which are against one’s prescribed duties. And the word akarma refers to activities which have no reaction at all. In the execution of akarmic activities, there may appear to be some reactions, but in actuality there are not. When we work under the directions of Kṛṣṇa, this is actually the case—there are no reactions. If we take it upon ourselves to kill someone, we are subject to capital punishment by the state government. Our actions are then called vikarma, for they are against prescribed actions. If, however, the government drafts us into the army, and we engage in battle and kill someone, we do not suffer the reactions, and this is called akarma. In the one case we are acting according to our own whims, and in the other we are acting under the direction of the government. Similarly, when we act under the direction of Kṛṣṇa, our actions performed are called akarma, for that kind of activity has no reaction.

We began with a modest three room spa on Yonge and Eglinton (2375 Yonge Street), which we still have. This spa has a retail area in the front that walk-ins could purchase natural skincare and cosmetics from. It was a tough start because this was over ten years ago and most people had not learnt about the importance of avoiding chemicals in their cosmetics. But we did have a fierce, devoted core group of regular customers. They were mostly made up of hypersensitive skinned people who could only use soothing, natural products.

Not only is she teaching 2 2day Bride & Groom figure classes, but she is also joining us for her wonderful Head & Hands workshop - perfect for those needing to improve their skills or for those looking for a refresher!
For this quilt I had set up some rules for myself.
Studies have shown that frequent use of the drug can actually lead to more anxiety and higher rates of mental illness like depression.

I think I was on the "Nice List" this year.
MITOCHONDRIAL RESPIRATION is a fancy scientific name for the process in which our bodies (in our mitochondria) CONVERT FOOD into ENERGY to run our organs and our selves. In other words if you INHIBIT that process…then you INHIBIT ENERGY production… and I am guessing you can figure out what that means for your organs and your body…energy failure= organ shutdown.
Which wasn’t enough motivation for her. From what she experienced so far, riding was stupid, boring, uncomfortable, and painful. Why would she want to become a skilled mage if the reward was getting thrown off a horse? And horses were smelly anyway. She could hardly imagine keeping one, or even hanging around stables like those boys did. Some of the other orphans would do that, to try and become like those other stableboys. They would say that it would be a good introduction to a steady career. Creme just thought they smelled like horse poo all the time. Who in there right mind would want to smell like that?

It was so much fun to see the huge success this had :)
Further surveillance allows the police to ascertain the time and place of the meet between Mister D and the fence, upon which they swoop. Mister D, the fence, and their companions are arrested, and merchandise stolen in the original jewel heist recovered from the possession of Mister D, who confesses to his role in that crime. A warrant is issued for Mister A's arrest and he is informed, untruthfully, that Mister D has fingered him, Mister B, and Mister C for the initial heist. He is also shown the jewellery recovered from Mister D, upon which he admits his part in the crime and testifies against Mister B and Mister C, something which Mister D refused to do. All four men are sentenced to long jail sentences.

It is sometimes hard to discern a connection between the courts’ procedures and the needs of the businesses which are the primary user base. Master Whitaker puts the users at the top of his article:

The article goes on with even more stylistic flourishes, at one point calling the nearby Burnaby Mountain Golf Course an opportunity to “unleash your inner Tiger” — this is a direct quote. The tower itself is described as residing in a “protective enclave” off the Lougheed Highway. Consider that image. Now that’s a sad painting.
I cut the image out using spellbinders nesties and added some stamping around the edge using a Stempleglede stamp from the grunge collection.
“These kids are really normal — they just want to be the other gender,” said Meyer, a psychiatrist who works with transgender patients at the University of Texas Medical Branch, in Galveston. “The ones who are well-adjusted and well-accepted by their families and at school don’t have the psychiatric issues.”

-We are having trouble getting pregnant right now due to breastfeeding
It was one year ago tonight that we found out that Cub was gone. At this time last year, Ted and I were standing in the hallway at the Medical Centre hugging each other and crying. We got home and told some people and cried. My sister Laurie came over and sat with us on the couch, as we all just stared blankly ahead of us, trying to understand how it could happen again. I was glad she came over, but it was hard being next to her four-month-pregnant belly.

However, his main point has stayed in the back of my mind since then, and I'm continually reminded of how important it is, and how often I see people who clearly don't get it.
The worst of times.
Andrew and I went out to lunch yesterday, to this authentic mexican restaurant that we'd heard is the best in town. (sidenote, it is the best most authentic in town, but.......its just different than in CA. I think the mexicans that have restaurants here are from a different area than CA mexicans. because the food is just different. Also there is tex mex, which Im not a big fan of yet)....ANYWAY I thought we would take Tex with us, hes been places with us in the car many many many times, and i didnt even think twice about leaving him in the truck as we went to go eat lunch.
“Who the hell are you?” He pulled out a silver gun and pointed it at me.
21. Gavin Bryars - My First Hommage
I was not disappointed for the opening chapter hooked me right away with its description of a wedding to take place in some small town in Ohio. There was also a vivid description of the girl standing outside while wedding guests are beginning to assemble outside a local Lutheran church. Only later do we learn that she is the bride and for some reason I can’t explain, I was somewhat surprised by that. I suspect this was due to the author’s great storytelling.
I cut out one of the transparencies and layered it over my photo. I even cut out the little banner that was actually the collection title, but I just thought it was so cute! To make sure that you wouldn't see any glue or tape, I secured it by running it through the sewing machine. While I was at the sewing machine, I added some texture by crumpling up some lace and using it as a border. I didn't think to grab any letters to go with this collection (I'm not even sure there's any out yet). So, I grabbed some light grey paper and ran it through my FMIL's silhouette. The silhouette never cuts as well as my Cricut does, but I do enjoy the versatility of being able to choose any font on the computer.
We have been practicing positive eugenics in animal husbandry for centuries now and to mixed results. Breeding programs using positive eugneics have produced food livestock that is bigger, better, healthier and more resistant to disease. Examples of how the use of positive eugenics in entertainment (racing, purebred shows and competitions) animal husbandry combined with human greed and the desire to win produces a Barbaro, with legs too delicate to withstand the physical stress of a thoroughbred race. Or there is the example of how breeding purebred showdogs and show cats with “smushed in” faces, like bulldogs and Persian cats, resulting in the need for Caesarian section births (heads too large) and chronic upper respiratory and breathing issues because of the “accordian” trachea. But they win in the show ring every time….
I was on my way out to dinner, so said I'd reply to him later (haven't done that yet), but have been thinking at brief moments just _how_ to reply to that. The simple answer is just that that's what I saw happening, but that's not enough for the reader. There always _is_ a reason why things happen or are necessary, whether I know what that is when I write it or not. So what is it here?
Book Received From: Penguin for Review
So it’s a real puzzler.
“I’ll still be your son,” he said. “I’ll just be 6 like all my friends. They’re fun.”
What about the U.S. Constitution? What about the American taxpayers, who pay for FAO’s projects while we have cuts to our Social Security?
‘Turn the page’ was a track which initially identified the unique ability of Pablo to merge many elements of sound, sampling, production and spoken word. Although often working in a very different manner Alex Under chose to create his own version of this track, challenging the boundaries of his previous productions. Given the multitude of individual factors in the original there could be real difficulty in forging a dynamic and personal sound. Alex Under however, has managed to put his unique stamp on this track and the Turn the page remix contains both a reverent nod to the original track and an individualistic new creation. Some of the vibrant and obscure sounds of the original are drawn on to heighten beats and add depth to the core of the track; taking apart the linear arrangement and reintegrating aspects at key points. The narrative aspect of the track, however, remains and Alex Under deals with this spoken word lyricism skilfully, enjoying something of a departure from his sparser productions and utilising the vocal presence to enhance the emotive quality of the track.
So to set the record straight, right off the bat:
“I don’t believe Colorado has ever had hail that big – and I hope we never do,” Doesken said. “But stones don’t need to be that big to cause damage.

This truthful and friendly piece of advice would have resulted in the Senator being chopped into bite-sized morsels by the Emperor’s German bodyguards and fed to the fish in the Tiber. And if Caligula had thought the Senator’s sentiments were widely shared, a massive cull of the Roman nobility would have followed. Telling the truth simply does not work in situations like that.
“When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, ‘Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.’ So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.”
What difference does all of this make? Leave the Garden of Eden for a moment and come to today. What do God and Christianity say about a woman’s worth?
Different things stand out on different days, but all of it is so good and so true.

The Crying God is not nearly full, only a few tourist from the neighborhood are there. The music is bad and the two girls are bored. If the music stays like this, i will go home in half an hour, tells the Persian Princess´ friend. Such a mess, she feels like dancing, but she still doesn´t wanna stay alone. She went out for party the last two days on her own and always the boys were flirting with her so much. She doesn´t feel like running aways from boys the whole evening. Before she can start to bag her friend to stay, a hand covers her eyes from the back and another arm comes around her hip and turns her around: Prince Charming kisses her lips and smiles. „Finally I made it!“, he says.
I fancy myself as someone that’s not much of a celebrity chaser, but after last night’s Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds show at the Royal Oak Music Theater — more on the concert in a moment — my friends and I saw an opportunity maybe catch Mr. Gallagher after the show. We walked through a parking lot toward the band’s buses and gear truck. A supposed “security guard” told us we had to turn around but one of my quick-thinking friends said, “We’re with the band.” Either he’s not too smart or he didn’t really mean to stop us, but he we walked on past and took a spot near the tour bus.

I’ve also heard people say that the employees of other transit systems around the world are nicer and smile at you. When people say this I just shut up because I then realize that I’m talking to someone who hates Toronto simply because it’s where they live, or it’s close to where they live. How often do you hear about people extolling the kindness of people in New York, much less the transit authority’s employees? Never. The rudeness of New Yorkers is well known and well respected because it shows that they are real people who don’t give a fuck if you want a smile when you walk by them because they shouldn’t need to smile at every damn person they see. When I hear someone say that the people on another city’s transit smiled at them, then I just have to wonder where their bubble is because apparently living in one is what they expect.
As it is, the data gathered here will provide not merely food for thought but actual data which will doubtless influence prospective employers when deciding what to offer future staff -- and also IP practitioners who are wondering what to expect when trading the flexibility and relative freedom of solo practice for the security of a career with a company or firm, or vice versa.
The negative impact of copycat behaviour brought about by close human connectedness can be, on the other hand, often fatal: alcoholism, the aforementioned smoking problems and drugs addiction. It usually starts innocently enough and in such a subtle way that before you know it you're in it up to your chest. A spliff is passed around. A drink is shared. A needle is produced. We, humans, are certainly interesting, and so are the networks we beget.
So, you've nearly finished and it's only taken less than ten minutes so far. When you're sure the ingredients are completely dissolved, pour the mixture into your bucket then fill to the top with water from the hot tap and stir it together thoroughly. You've made laundry liquid. And it's cost you about $2 Australian. Ten litres of laundry liquid at an Australian supermarket costs about $80! When you take into account the making, pouring and storing, it's taken you about 30 minutes. I make this about once every four months. If you have a large family, you might make it every two months. And it will save you about $80 every time you make it. How long would you have to work to make $80? Saving it is much easier.
Well I am so happy to say that I got some much needed crafty time in today.

It’s not just a Google project either. It seems like everyone has gotten aboard the augmented reality train. From comic books, to magazines, to hotels, to sports teams, to Nasa, almost everyone sees some application for augmented reality. Whether it’s enhancing your product (comics/magazines), selling ever more advertisements (ahem, Google), or helping pilots prevent plane crashes (NASA), most companies and organizations realize that augmented reality is the future. Perhaps, but do people actually want to augment their reality, and if they do, what does it mean to want to augment reality?

I have loved this book since I was 9. I bought my third copy yesterday, as my previous two copies have fallen apart. I don't think I fully understood all the puns and wordplay then, but I loved the strange characters and the map at the beginning of the book! (All fantasy books should have maps, in my opinion). I hope that you read it and discover it yourself. The 50th anniversary Harper Collins edition that I bought has an introduction by the late Diana Wynne Jones, which was a lovely discovery.

Our mission is to reverse the catastrophic wrongs inflicted by successive governments of all political persuasions upon our nation and people over the last forty years. We work on the principle of Cultural Nationalism and strive to create a Britain and a British people unified in defence of our freedom, democracy and culture. We aim to unite all our people in order to save our nation. You will have, attached to this document, our constitution and policies, so there is no need to detail those here, but the reason those policies were drafted was, in the first instance, to create a party that could be trusted by everyone and that put its members in a position whereby they could challenge the leadership if they felt things were not being done properly. Secondly, they were drafted to ensure that, when it comes to the governance of our nation, our policies have the necessary element of fairness coupled with a determination to re-create wealth and industry, jobs and futures, for all our citizens. We intend to work, not for our own financial benefit, but for the benefit of our nation, our people, and their children and grandchildren. No officer or member of this party will ever stand accused of ‘doing nothing’ or profiteering whilst our nation drifted into corruption and decay.

Used to city breaks and more active travelling, I felt a little strange being largely resort based though our aim for this trip was to chill out, which we did, and I can't fault the resort's convenience for a child. Everything was on our doorstep, it was easy to pop LLC upstairs for a midday nap, she could eat for free at certain times in a couple of the hotel's restaurants and we also managed to wheel her out asleep in her pushchair on the nights we went for a late dinner or evening drink. I’m not sure how much more mileage we’ll get out of that night transplant from bed to stroller and back trick, but it’s handy while it lasts! And to satisfy our want of exploring, we did rent a car and visited Mdina, Valetta, Saint Julians and much of the rugged, barren limestone that is Malta - I hadn't realised it must really be only about the size of the Isle of Wight.

Patent Troll Tracker uses the term “non-practicing entities” or NPEs defined as “entities that don't make any products”. PTT asserts that of the lawsuits over the past two years, approximately 50% came from NPE’s. However, in the last 3 months, according to PTT, “that number shoots up to 70% from companies that don't make products. And if you limit the list to tech companies, 80% of the lawsuits came from companies that don't make products”.

The next boat in our class to round the mark was about 12 minutes behind us.

Our Rubber Stamp Release for March is celebrating all of this as well. We are getting ready for planting gardens, watching butterflies fluttering about, listening to bumblebees buzzing all around and hearing birds singing. We are celebrating all of the NEW things spring brings. Some of us like to decorate for spring holidays. Others will be welcoming someone to the neighborhood or welcoming home a new little one. Whatever it is you are celebrating this spring, Fresh Brewed Designs has a stamp to help you create for it!
I have literally no idea what other people make of me, I find it very difficult to read people in that way. All I have to go on is my own self image, which is not very healthy or kind, so thats a bit depressing.
An event is a term used in many game-making programs, but most especially in RPGMaker. An event is what makes things happen in a game. To see the event screen in VX, click here. Some people will refer to the art of creating events as "eventing" to parallel their efforts with "scripting", this is as events can be used to create things as simple as non-playable characters or things as complex as whole battle-systems. It is generally agreed that, the more difficult a system is, the better it is to use "scripting" than "eventing" to create it (and vice-versa).

So when I made the shadow box canvas I had a piece of canvas left over from where I cut out the canvas to form the shadow box. I saved it because it was a nice piece of mod-podged canvas and knew I could figure out something to do with it.

Since it was sturdy and covered in music, I figured it would be a good basis for a book mark for my violin playing girls.

It was as I filled the bins with water for the first time that I recalled some amazing olives bought in Sainsbury’s last year. Moroccan in origin, they claimed to be salt-cured. They were dark, squidgy and required a desalinating dip in water before you ate them. This isn’t quite Morocco, but we have black olives. I picked a batch of both small and large black fruit and researched the matter. Packed in jars with sea salt around them, apparently these will keep on getting better. The salt leaches the excess moisture and bitterness from the olives, apparently.

As I said earlier, one of my favorite filler episodes in this season is Goku's Ordeal, the last episode in the Trunks Saga. This episode is about Goku and Piccolo trying to get their driver's license. As you can probably guess, much hilarity ensues. The humor in this episode is very reminiscent of that found in the original Dragon Ball. It made me laugh out loud when it saw it years ago and it still does today.

The turn out for this street fair was massive, around 20,000 people! Oddly enough we did just about as good as we do at the Portland Saturday market. I was a bit bummed at a few moments when i realized that not having a way to accept credit cards had cost us around $300 in sales that day. So, yesterday i figured a way to remedy the issue. Apparently many art vendors have it set up so that they can take credit card payments through their smartphone through a device called "square up." Honestly I have desperately tried to resist the smartphone movement, but here we are I guess. I called my service provider who informed me I was due for an upgrade and that I could get the Pixi smartphone for free, and then download the software that will allow me to take credit card payments on the go. So, I should have the phone before this weekend and I am very interested to try it out and see if the new capabilities will improve sales.

I liked this novel of Sara Bennett. It was something different. I have read so far many romance novels. Yes this one had the typical undying love but they couldn’t be together. But this time it was because the man wasn’t good enough. He was lower than her which was different. But the thing I thought was fascinating about this novel was that Portia took it upon herself to find what she needed and that was all she wanted, and she didn’t linger. She knew what was at cost. It was the man who couldn’t stop, he wanted her and only her. He wasn’t able to give her up.
And then I will be more successful!

Currently, the student leaders of the InterVarsity chapter at UCI are running the fellowship on their own, learning about what it means to share God’s supernatural love with others, especially with each other. From the stories they share, they have been experiencing a depth in their relationships with each other as they share everything from prayer requests to food to board games. The depth in relationship has increased their trust with each other and with God.
As best as I remember, we were clear re the direction the music should take. We felt it was important to produce an album that reflected the definitive sound of the band and one that would hopefully stand up along side Four Moments and Windchase. Keeping in mind, when the band was a happening force in the mid 70s, we were young, passionate and determined to make our mark.
Fitting in with the crowd can be a big issue with girls growing up. It's hard being an outsider, and like many girls, Nicole will do almost anything to try and fit in. This is only half of the story though. Her worries has a small effect on the friendship circle she belongs to at Silver Spire, but the more important issue is her friendship with the new Italian student, Antonia. Well, there's actually a lack of friendship, and a bit of hostility which really bothers Nicole. When everything comes to a head, I was crying over the book. How the two girls sorted out their issues was touching, and a really good idea. I cried again at the end when all the friends discussed what had happened. It's a fine demonstration about how you can really misjudge a person.

I am not blind to the flaws in the application process. But to attack its very core, one that is not just dear to us because of sentimentality, but what we got from it… it’s just insane. Bringing up legalities– OH MY GOD, have you taken a gander at the application process of about 70% of the orgs in UP?– feels like just an afterthought, a rationalization of some unfounded bitterness. A justification of why they had to go bitching about it.
So why am I finding it so hard to write the first line…first paragraph…first page? Or at least write something I’m happy with. It isn’t that I’m trying to start in the wrong place – more that I can’t find the right place.

I computer generated the sentiment, again. This time using Jokerman. I then cut each word up and backed it in a dark red paper. The same paper was punched using a Martha Stewart punch to make a ribbon. I know I should have used the corner punch and made it into an even prettier border but I wasn't up to doing the math to figure out what size I could make and where to start the punching. I used some of the punched out pieces to decorate the top of the card.

I have an enviable job because I don’t have to “sell” anybody on the company. All we have to do is get our foot in the door, do one small job for a potential client, and we have a shot at future work. Max and Manuel are fast and good at their work. They depend on Max’s wife and me to take care of the office, to estimate and project management work since they have zero know-how in that department. That’s the drawback to the job. Am I up to that challenge? Can I cover the bases, observe the jobs, make sure we are making a profit and that our books reflect reality? Diana’s amazing but she has never kept books. This has been a learning experience for her. We are lucky to have a good CPA, but she’s an end of the year presence.
But don't think that if you are just a bean counter or a shelf stocker that your job can't be fulfilling. As long as you do your job with a sense of purpose, that sense of doing good work and being needed will stretch itself across your life.
The way I see it, vegan food speaks for itself. It is just as delicious as non-vegan food, with the added benefit of not containing dead animals. If that's not enough of a sell for you, then I'm not going to be able to convince you by screaming "meat is murder!" I was really disappointed to see people accusing Tasha of having lied about her illnesses or secretly hating animals or calling her a bitch and even evidently sending her and her family death threats. (WTF?) Guys, we don't win the war against factory farming and cruelty to animals by attacking non-vegans, especially people who tried it and couldn't make it work for them. In my opinion it is much more effective to seduce people gently, by serving them delicious vegan and vegetarian options to eat, providing them with information if necessary, and raising awareness of the dangers of the current food system. A lot of people come over on their own, but almost no one changes the way they think about food because of being cursed out or attacked. I mean, is that how you went vegan?

Though they had every necessary provision at each point of need, they complained against God and against Moses, His servant.

We are finally reaching a time when parents are standing up for the rights of their children and opting out of tests. Social media has played a great role in this where parents are able to find others from their state who are doing the same thing they are and also discover and share information and resources at sites like the Opt Out of Standardized Tests wiki. They are uniting and getting smarter about their parental right to decide what is best for their children.
Ah memories. My first Michael Jordan Game Used Jersey card. When this card came out back in 2002, I thought there would be no way I'd ever afford it. I did, and it became the first game used MJ Jersey card in my collection. I never thought I'd ever own a jersey card of the greatest basketball player that ever lived and for a good long while this was my most favorite card of my collection.

Last quarter was a terribly difficult one for me. My students were absolutely horrid, and although the schedule was disrupted by snow and illness, I was intensely frustrated with them, their lack of initiative to help get things back on track, and their general attitude towards class. But, as I am prone to do, I began internalizing it as my own fault. Was I not working hard enough? Was I on autopilot, as I had taught this material before? Was I allowing the other things going on in my life to affect my teaching?

Whatever, promising to carry out her duties as Miss Liberty 1984 to the best of her ability, we open on a close up of China Blue's smiling face. The camera slowly pans out to reveal that she is sitting on her gynaecological throne in a cunnilingual manner.

Although the Supreme Court, in the case of Custodio vs. President of the Senate, G. R. No. L-117 (42 Off. Gaz., 1243) held in a minute resolution “That the constitutionality of a legislative act is open to attack only by person whose rights are affected thereby, that one who invokes the power of the court to declare an Act of Congress to be unconstitutional must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid, but that he has sustained or is in immediate danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of its enforcement,” that ruling was laid down without a careful consideration and is contrary to the ruling laid down in the majority of jurisdictions in the United States that “In the determination of the degree of interest essential to give the requisite standing to attack the constitutionality of a statute, the general rule is that not only persons individually affected, but also have taxpayers, have sufficient interest in preventing the illegal expenditures of money raised by taxation and may therefore question the constitutionality of statutes requiring expenditures of public moneys.” (Am. Jur., Vol. 11, p. 761) All the members of this Court, except two, in taking cognizance of those cases, rejected the respondents’ contention, reversed the ruling in said case and adopted the general rule above mentioned; and we believe the latter is better than the one adopted in said case of Custodio, which was based on a doctrine adhered to only in few jurisdiction in the United States; because if a taxpayer can not attack the validity of the executive orders in question or a law requiring the expenditure of public moneys, one under our laws could question the validity of such laws or executive orders.

There are a lot of things to hate (and to love) about parenting. I could go on all day about giving up my independence, losing my freedom, hanging onto my identity with the skin of my teeth, but the important thing to remember is that these things are all passing. They are as fleeting, in fact, as the five things I’m about to list here…the five petty things I hate about parenting at this very moment.

However, I’ve seen a growth in mutterings that demanding clear beer is a bit passé and 20th century, and drinkers should be willing to embrace a new wave of funky, artisanal cloudy beer. Moor Brewery in Somerset put forward a motion to the 2012 AGM of SIBA that the organisation should remove clarity as a requirement for beer competitions. Whether the motion succeeded I don’t know.

AYR: There are two parts to that answer. First, Kuntzman says "we'll cross that bridge when we come to it." I'll note that the Spring 2009 issue of "Brooklyn!!" remains a Courier-Life publication, so it's reasonable to assume that the relationship will continue. Also, while he may not know more about the relationship, he seems to be backing off from the previous request that Markowitz explain the relationship.
Tastes of wine or liquor with a dry finish. This is a good beer, but understandably heavy since it is a porter. This beer isn’t one to be trifled with. It’s not a so-called session beer at 6.4% abv.

“Always at all times rejoice and in case you didn’t get that, I said rejoice.” Emphatically he commands us twice to rejoice. And he doesn’t say rejoice because of your circumstance, he says rejoice in spite of your circumstance; he says rejoice in the Lord. It’s all a question of focus. You’re not rejoicing in the world. You’re not rejoicing in the struggles. You’re not rejoicing in the things going on around you. You’re rejoicing in the Lord.

After the Christians are “taken away” into Heaven to be with the Lord forever, then the dispensation of the Grace of God is finished! ENDED! (Romans 11:25.) God will then take up with the Jews again right where He left off when He set them aside and the prophecies recorded in the Old Testament book of Daniel and the four gospels will be fulfilled. There will be 3 ½ years of peace when a ruler will take over the world. Under him there will be one world government, one world currency, one world language and one world religion. People will trust this one world leader even to the point of worshipping him. The Bible tells us that he is “AntiChrist” and empowered by Satan (2 Thessalonians 2:4; 1 John 2:18.)

He gets asked about this lawyer/avocado thing a lot.

Place the stack of wrappers on a work surface and keep covered with a clean, damp kitchen towel or paper towel to prevent them from drying out. Holding a wrapper on the palm of one hand, place about 1 teaspoon of the filling in the center of the wrapper. With a fingertip, swipe one-half of the edge of the wrapper with a little water, and then fold over the other edge to meet the dampened edge, enclosing the filling and pinching to seal securely. With your fingers, make 3 or 4 evenly spaced pleats along the sealed edge and place the dumpling, flat side down (the opposite of the pleats) on a sheet of waxed paper. Repeat until all the filling has been used up. (At this point, you can freeze them on a rimmed baking sheet, place in the freezer, and then transfer the frozen dumplings to a zippered plastic bag and return to the freezer for up to 1 month. Cook them directly from the freezer, allowing a few minutes longer cooking time when the pan is covered.)
Coordinated efforts are helping to realise the “dream project” of pedestrianising Street 29, previously called Santa Isabel Street, and restoring it “just like it used to be,” said Millán.

Beth: I forget when exactly now, but somewhere around 3 or 4 miles I’d seen the 2 hour pacer pass and thought welp, there goes that, but if it’s going to end up being hot this whole time I can live with that. Still have yet to get many runs in while it’s just been HOT outside. At some point running along White Rock Lake a breeze was coming through periodically so I started to feel good and knew I could pick up my game some but that there where still hills to conquer! Even though I had my Runkeeper app going I wasn’t fully aware of where I stood to finish this thing at the pace I was at, but I knew if I wanted it I could possibly bust out another sub two half. Just as we were leaving the lake we had pretty much switched over into a new climate. It was cool! I let out a woohoo!! And the people around me said yes! This feels good! This next part I mention only because it gave me a laugh out there but shortly after this I’m coming up on this muscular guy running without his shirt on and then I see him raise one arm, flex and admire his bicep.

So despite my horrible pacing skills and having to run hard just to catch up I had a great time, a really great time. I've never run the San Francisco marathon and it was good to finally check that item off my list. Run my own city's marathon - check! I felt great afterwards. I even went to TRX class that afternoon (I had a free pass for a week and wanted to make the best of it.)No lingering fatigue or issues now. I was so psyched that I signed up for another ultra this month! I feel good. I am officially recovered and back in the mix.

The other day my students were reading a post. Many of the details where incorrect, or better, twisted to serve, what we felt, was the purpose of publishing for the sake of publishing. One of my students asked if this might be why the teacher in the south did not blog; what she does, she does for her kids, not for recognition.

There is a general impression today that the church is out of sync with society, holds to an outdated mode of thought and practice, and has disqualified itself to serve as any kind of conscience for social mores. Thirty years ago some popular entertainers, both with a Christian background, spoke of their dissatisfaction for the modern-day church. One said, “I don’t need to go to church and listen to some preacher tell me what to believe in. I don’t dig that at all.” Another member of the same singing group spoke with disgust of the “hypocrisy personified” that typifies the contemporary church.
Now the issue that prompted this post. Our company has negotiated to break the lease on our current office space, and in that negotiation, it was determined that the landlords of the building would keep all our furniture.

But in all this fury of the return to painting, abstraction really hasn’t come into play. Abstraction is not cool. Certainly not abstraction with an “A,” or an “Expressionism” following it. Abstrqaction is cool if you are being funny about it. If you are being a snotty brat about it. And painting hasn’t really been “returned to” at all. The painting and drawing plastered ironically in galleries is ignorant, and clueless. It is completely unaware of its past and its roots. It’s what Jerry Salz is calling “termite art.” And that sort of stuff never goes very far. This is not to say everyone should return to Greenburg and think in some sort of abject high minded way about art, but if you are indeed working in a medium which goes back to the caves, you probably should try to have some idea where it has gone. It would also follow that you would want to know.
I have a plan for my new house that I am so excited about. I always new that I wanted a mudroom for my boys to enter when we bought a house, but unfortunately, it doesn't have one. Let's face it, boys do not come into the house, open the closet doors, put their shoes and knapsacks in nicely and then hang their coats up. No, instead, nothing makes it to the closet and everything ends up on the floor.

Closely related to this point is the principle that the implicit must be interpreted by the explicit, rather than the explicit interpreted by the implicit. This particular rule of interpretation is violated constantly.
Once again something from Lake Norman area of Charlotte. I'm about to wrap up my drinking of oktoberfests and pumpkin beers, but I figured it's good to get a local one in there. Light haze to accent the amber color (they must love amber up here). I get a light rush of pumpkin flavor and nutmeg, very nice. Good mouthfeel with a low hops in the finish. This is one of the better pumpkin ales I've had in this season. Or it could be that Red Oak is messing me up. Either way, 3 Stars.
I still want to make zero waste (or as close as possible), meanwhile, I've started following economy and politics even (who would have thought??!)
Thank you all so much for your support. It means so much to us.

I’m meeting with my internist and an endocrinologist next week to hopefully get some answers to what’s going on in this not so little body of mine. Celiac’s Disease can be very perplexing and finding the right balance can be tough. I am finding that even with removing gluten from my diet, I am now having to focus on removing refined sugars and was really shocked to find that sugar is in so much of what we eat!!
I’d actually forgotten that over a year ago, I posted a list of things that my school could benefit from, should any traveller have a space in their rucsack to bring us things. So you can imagine how delighted I was to get an email from the Netherlands this week from some some tourists coming on holiday here next week, and asking us what we would like them to bring. I guess I need to update our page now that the school no longer exists, but its fantastic to be able to put an update and to include items for the zoo, OPG, dog shelter, and young people in general.
I went working in my garden today. Actually, I planted a few things for the first time this year. "Late" is not the word for it. "Ridiculously late" is the word for it. I'm about two months behind planting time, but seeing that bare patch of nothing out there where there used to be green growing produce finally drove me to distraction. And to buying some zucchini, squash, three varieties of tomatoes and some cucumber seeds.
I could tell the heat was getting to her. We sat under a tree in the shade and looked at the huge field, where some stray dogs were gambolling around in the shimmering heat. Men and women walked by us, so young and full of hope and promise. There, I told her stories. Stories of when I first crossed the threshold of the huge campus, my nervous heart beating fast, leaving behind my sheltered life at an all girl’s school, my dreams and aspirations as an eighteen year old, stories of the laughter I shared, my fears that I faced, the mistakes I made, the thoughts that I learnt to think, the books that I read, the friends that I found and kept for life. I showed her the building where her grandfather, my father, came to study Engineering, as a young man. He walked the same paths as I did, frequented the same canteens as I, made friends, laughed a bit, gave his heart, got his heart-broken, just like I did. My ten-year old listened quietly. There was no impatience, no eye rolls, no exasperated sighs. It was a beautiful moment of bonding between us. I think the place became meaningful to her as her eyes swept through the moldy yet grand buildings, the greenish brown fields with burnt grass, the mangy stray dogs and the trash littered across.

I’ve noted that June 3rd my mechanic Tony advised me that he’d been offered a job by another Firestone dealership in Brampton, which was much closer to where he lived. We never discussed pay, but it sure caused me some concern as he was my only licenced mechanic at the time. Nothing came of it, I never was certain it was true, but he remained with me.

For years I've thought about surveys. You see the results through poll statistics and leading indicators.

Things are still quiet in my home garden, except for some chives about to pop, so I thought I would highlight the bountiful crop of hot peppers from the 2011 Crispy Garden for my WHB post. I grew another batch of Tiburon peppers, a fairly spicy dark green poblano. We roasted them, we made chili rellenos and casseroles, put them in salsas and other sauces and chopped up so many that our entire chest freezer is perfumed with their scent.

Thank you, Erin, for being the most amazing woman I have ever known. You are more beautiful to me now than when we first met. The more we walk through life together, the more I fall in love with you. I can’t imagine how I would move forward without you by my side. I am a better man because of you. God has used you to shape me in more ways than I could ever recount. And, let’s be honest, our kids would be on the fast track to delinquency if I was a single dad. Thank you for fighting to live. Thank you for being brave. Thank you for all of the days we have spent together and for all of the many that still lie ahead. You changed things. Thank you!
These cookies were soooo delicious! I couldn't stop eating them! They weren't like the usual gingerbread cookies that are rock hard and hurt your teeth. They were crispy on the edges and soft on the inside. I was surprised that they were still pretty soft, after being in an airtight container in the fridge for 3 days!
I am really excited about this new series and I am hopeful you all may find something you didn't know.
The other problem for UKIP is that they claim to be a libertarian party but aren't. If most of their members looked at what libertarianism actually is they would be horrified. Of course to many people today libertarianism is a nice flag of convenience, that is the case with UKIP. Apart from the EU the membership would split down the middle on any other serious issue. That's why it is, and will remain, a single issue party.

I have a folder of projects. I write down an idea when it arrives and then add to it and my mind works on it for a while. If I'm still thinking about it and it is giving me energy rather than draining me after a month or so, it goes on the short list. But writing a book is a big commitment because once I start, I have to work on it everyday. Right now I am more drawn to short fiction and have three more short stories in the works.

If I don't accomplish my goals, well gift cards are a wonderful solution. But, first, I need a hearty breakfast so that I don't eat the cookies, I'm about to bake.

Louis Bonaparte sees himself, writes Marx, as the defender of the “bourgeois order” and hence as “the representative of the middle class” (read the capitalist class, mainly the middle bourgeoisie); “at the same time, as the representative of the peasants and of the people in general, who wants to make the lower classes of the people happy within the frame of bourgeois society”; but “above all, Bonaparte himself as the chief of the Society of December 10 , as the representative of the lumpenproletariat to which he himself, his entourage, his government and his army belong, and whose prime consideration is to benefit itself and draw California lottery prizes from the state treasury.”

Most of the time, burnout is invisible to its victims until it becomes extreme. But even when they recognize it, they can't remedy it because their fundamental ability to take care of themselves is impaired. There are the obvious signs -- no vacations (or pseudo-vacations in which one is in frequent contact with work), working while sick, failing to eat well or exercise, poor sleep, and overuse of alcohol or prescription medication. And then there are the subtler signs -- lowered immunity to pessimism, and joylessness. There should be a warning on your membership card that reads: "Becoming too involved in the progressive movement can be hazardous to your health."

2) a double jogging stroller. This is a cool story, for I had been on the look-out for a double jogging stroller since I realized that having just a single jogging stroller increased the logistic factor when I wanted to go running. I was made aware of a double jogging stroller on a buy/sell/trade sort of page, but it was too far away and too expensive. Still, I felt like this might be my change to land a double stroller, so I decided to talk to Steve about it and see if we could somehow swing it. That very afternoon, I received a text from a friend who was given a double jogging stroller but did not have use for it. So she gave it to me! Whee! I tried it out with the kids this afternoon and, let me tell you, it is a nice stroller. What a blessing! In honor of all of this, Clara and I have decided to run our first 5K in July. Jazzercise tells us that we could probably run a 5K right now, but I wouldn't mind having a few weeks to get used to the feel of a longer distance run.

But I'm not sure that Mr.1% should really be considered part of the community, at least from a community perspective. His behavior wasn't just a little unusual for the community. His behavior was so out of line of the community norm that I can't see him lasting long where the community is extremely friendly and cohesive.

Speaking of today, your little sister had a doctor’s appointment this morning. You see, little Abby was born with a spot on her head…well I guess it isn’t just a spot. It’s a birthmark. Your Nana said once that she believes that is where God had his hand on her head throughout my entire pregnancy. It’s a nice thought and I think she is right. So this morning your daddy and I took her to the dermatologist to have it looked at just as a precaution. Another reason we wanted to take her in is because when your big sister went to the neurologist for her seizures one of the first things they asked us was what kinds of birthmarks and/or moles she had. I guess when babies are just forming the tissue that forms the skin is the same tissue that forms the brain. And some times if there are abnormalities in the skin, such as birthmarks or moles, they can be indications of abnormalities in the brain.
The 2011 report is about the same. "Continuing to serve naturally raised meats in all of our restaurants is one of our primary goals, but we have and will continue to face challenges in doing so. Some of our restaurants served conventionally raised chicken or steak for much of 2011, a few markets reverted to conventionally raised beef in early 2012, and more of our restaurants may periodically serve conventionally raised meats in the future due to supply constraints."

A super easy, great tasting dish made complicated by myself - I forgot I was out of garam masala, but knew I had enough ingredients that I could make a batch. Which added an easy 20 minutes to my prep. I also over cooked my potatoes so they weren't as firm as they should have been for the frying bit. ((sigh)) some nights are like that. Still, this was great on it's own and would be good as a side to some tandori style chicken thighs.

﻿﻿ I'm now making my own way with my own family, and I definately appreciate a solid background in pretentious hippy food. I am avoiding the later low cal fads she jumped on, based on my brief perusal of some of the latest books, and my go-to blog for all things healthy, http://www.kellythekitchenkop.com/. I ply my kids with smoothies and grass-fed beef, lots of cheese and 5 ingredient ice cream. I've taught them to be scared of HFCS, although they can't get enough sugar and prefer in-n-out to my burgers, but I hope I'm giving them the foundation to someday enjoy these as much as I do.
Because of my mother's example, I am somewhat of a workaholic. I teach full-time, but also dabble in little things like writing, babysitting, tutoring, gardening, etc. I know that if I need to make some extra money, the opportunities are there for me to do so. It also helps to keep life from being monotonous. When I get tired of one thing, I can often focus on something else for a while. And I always make sure that I leave time for friends and family, like she did for us.

The present debate is on whether to keep it secret like other countries are doing or in custom of a total see-through society come out and tell the truth. India is so loose and democratic; it is very hard to keep a secret for long. The major anxiety of the Government today is that unlike other countries, it will be very difficult to keep it secret much longer. If the information comes out through unauthorized channels first and then the authorities are pressed against the wall to confess, two bad things can happen. First, it can actually cause a panic in the country as well as the world. Second, the way the Indian politics is run, the ruling party will be thrown out of power in no time.
Through blu-ray we learn for example when lip syncing is off, even if it's within 1/10 of a second - or maybe the lips just don't seem right because they're so clear. I always notice it in the opening speech of PATTON, but hey, when a guy standing three miles away in front of a giant color bar flag that used to be your friend is talking and you can see his lips don't match, then blu-ray is pretty amazing. Scott's nose is amazing on blu-ray, too: we can see three layers of veins in. But his aim sucks. When shooting at German dive bombers, you have to lead them, not shoot behind them! He should have shot straight over his head - you got to "lead" em (1)! What's the point of using real planes if you're not going to shoot correctly? but these is quibbles meant in love.

Yet I see no force for them anywhere, no voice for the poor ,the hard done by, the lonely and the disabled, the old look back to a better age whilst the young look to a nothing future, plastic engulfs the very nation and the east grows fat upon the pound. Yes unfairness drives me to anger, anger because its is all I have ever known and I expect all I will ever know, I see the predator moving among good people, the criminal amassing wealth and the worker paying thee greatest criminals of all and I seek change, seek freedom from it but a lone voice creates no resonance. My life has been one of poverty, of scrimp and scrap, of shoddy diet and shoddy goods, of yes I suppose envy of those who have and anger at the plight of the many. Yet it is not so much for myself I lament, although I am still young enough to still desire a life, still yearn for freedom from financial slavery but for my children, for that most precious of things to me, my children.

My pastor actually had this book on our reading list. It is a must read for anyone. In it the main character Pi, questions why you cannot belong to more than one religion. The most poignant line I read in that book:

It seems now internationally accepted that design galleries are participating art fairs which used to be dominated by more fine art-focused galleries. One of these new risers at Art Geneve was teo jakob. The booth was large and beautifully arranged with new designs and reproduction of old ones. Their catalogue was filled with modern day classics; Eames, Henningsen, Noguchi…to name a few. As amazing as they look, however, mass-produced reproduction of 50-year old designs look a bit sad probably because they lack a history of themselves (not the history of the archetype but the one of each piece). They also left me with a question: are we living on the great debt to the past? Of course these designs still have a strong appeal to the current taste (in other words, that’s why they are “classics”). But would would be the next Eames? Can we only find out after 50 years?
On the other hand, without a notebook, I won’t have any way to document what I’ve done beer-wise and thus, no way to post comments on this blog.

Whilst we were doing the work we took the opportunity to encorporate some bird friendly features. We’ve made holes in the eaves and boxed off an area inside the soffits entirely for the use of starlings and sparrows, put up a variety of nest boxes around the yard and in the barns, and left old trees with holes in them used by starlings in the garden. We’ve also got some mud around for the housemartins to use, and with the bigger pond there should be plenty of insects for them to feed on.

It is about the value of human life, therefore death penalty in any form, whether lethal injection or other methods, can never be justified. I remember reading a news article recently which said that just by causing the person to wait for the lethal injection to be ministered would likely to have caused some psychological trauma. I once watched a movie “Dead Man Walking”, which shows the actor Sean Penn who played the role of the condemned experiencing great fear and stress at the thought of dying before the execution. Death penalty is cruel and should be abolished for the sake of human dignity.
I'm going back to the basic plan. I have My Fitness Pal set at 1500 calories. I feel comfortable with that though I should probably lower it to 1200 to have optimal weight loss. I'm just not sure I can continue to do that forever and whatever plan I do now will have to be forever. One serving of carbs is 15 grams. I will allow myself no more than two servings at a sitting. Though my original plan was to be allowed 100 grams per day. I think I will try to stay closer to 60 grams per day. My weight loss was better when I stayed within that range.

I have no idea what Sly was thinking here; he already wrote and/or starred in some huge successes with the Rocky and Rambo movies and even scored what could be called a major independent hit (meaning not dependent on the name Rocky or Rambo) with 1981's Nighthawks. He even knew that his persona was silly enough to poke fun at himself with appearances on "The Muppet Show" and his delightfully self-effacing interviews on any given talk show of the day. However, Sly plays Lincoln Hawk as the second coming of Jesus, returned to Earth as a truck-driving, arm-wrestling sensitive guy who specializes in soft-spoken monologues and bellowing war cries as he brings down his opponents' arms.
When I envisioned the witches in this series, I wanted their faces to show more expression, and just a touch more realism than my Santas, yet with fairly simple bodies. I usually use a touch of paper clay to smooth out the faces, since the paper mache leaves them fairly rough or bumpy. Their hats are permanently attached. They have a touch of glitter paint on their hats, hems, and sleeve edges, that may not show up well in the photos. Hester's glitter is silver, and Edna's is green.

You would think that after the last two weeks we'd be beat down and can't go on. But that's not the case. We are happy, excited and looking forward to the calling that God has for us!! I'm about 80% sure that in the next 18 months God has some amazing things in store for our family, and I'm about 99% sure we are under a serious spiritual attack because of it.

The best approach for companies is to maintain a low profile, says Katherine Sredl, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. That’s particularly true in the Martin case, where any action by Mars could be interpreted as insincere or opportunistic.
As great as the marijuana proposal was, I equally admired the Mexicans' desire for me to drink while pregnant. Outside of being asked what cocktail I would like at every meal and every time I found myself at the pool, I was also informed by a professional Cabo San Lucasian (I made that up) skipper that his wife used to drink all the time during her pregnancy and found tequila to be the best relaxer for all those stressful pregnancies moments. Huh? Tequila during pregnancy? Genius again.

I spent AGES on trying to mask my little bunny because on the original stamp he was holding a carrot and I wanted to change him so that he was hugging the egg. So I was sitting at my table surrounded by post it notes and several unhappy attempts at masking and then my other half walked in and said, ‘why don’t you just cut the carrot off’. Grrr, why didn’t I think of that lol. Note to self.. don’t try and make cards late at night when you’re half asleep! I wouldn’t mind but I’ve masked a few things now but I couldn’t get it to work at all. Oh well, at least he pointed out the obvious lol

Torture starts with a bang. Three of the first four songs remind me in spirit of Slayer's Hell Awaits-Reign in Blood period. It isn't that they sound like those songs, but the heaviness, production, and breakneck speed create the same atmosphere of ferocity. The one exception in this group, Scourge of Iron, slows things down with a heavy crawl that brings Morbid Angel to mind. The fifth track, As Deep as the Knife Will Go, starts with an intense blast beat that shifts into a thrashy death metal crunch that reminds me more than a little of Deicide. The next three tracks that make up the album's midsection inject a trace of variety, keeping the songs from starting to sound the same. Track 6, Intestinal Crank, features some of the most technical riffing and bass on the album, plus a couple of great solos. Next, Followed Home Then Killed has a crushing groove and thrash sensibility. Then, The Strangulation Chair mixes a death groove with technicality, including a brief, but amazing, bass solo and some spacey runs by Webster. The last four songs finish with more intensity, with Caged...Contorted recalling early Malevolent Creation death-thrash, Crucifier Avenged giving an old-school death metal stomp like Slayer on steroids, Rabid scorching with fiery thrash metal, and Torn Through ending everything with massive blast beats.
I will be devastated beyond comprehension when my parents pass away. I'm truthfully not sure what I will do.
I always say if you want to know what ordinary South Africans think, read the Daily Sun.

Ha ha, state of this! How dated does this look? Another show which sticks in my memory. I especially loved it when the contestants flew on the back of the dragon.

2. Delay having children. The first years of marriage are difficult enough on their own without introducing the complication of children. Once children come, the wife’s attention is necessarily diverted, and huge stresses come upon you both. Spend the first several years of marriage getting to know each other, working through your issues, having fun together, and enjoying that intimate love relationship between just the two of you. Jan and I waited ten years before having our first child Charity, which allowed me the finish graduate school, get our feet on the ground financially, establish some roots, and enjoy and build our love relationship until we were really ready to take on the responsibilities of parenthood. The qualifier here is that if the wife desperately wants children now, then the husband should accede to her wish to become a mother, rather than withhold that from her. Her verdict should be decisive. But if you both can agree to wait, things will probably be much easier.

I am so grateful to have someone like me to love, someone who teaches me about myself. he is someone who I know years from now, I will be able to talk to about things and he will understand what I am feeling because he has felt it himself.

Now, it would seem, central government is beginning to blow less wind. The big multinationals, who are investing heavily in offshore wind, are beginning to worry that the cornucopia is not endless, that subsidies may no longer he as easy to get in future as they were in the past. Vestas, which wants to build a turbine factory in the county of Kent, is seeking assurances from David Cameron, the Prime Minister, that he is still behind wind energy. Thankfully, George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer and master of the purse strings, has made it clear that he at least is dead set against further expansion, all on the grounds of cost.

In the West, as the ability to read became more common, writing became more common. Letter writing was the rage and those who could write creatively were held in high esteem. But were they actually paid well for it? Not often. Rich people had books but didn’t read them, they used them like trophies to show they were cultured. Writers still struggled to make a living and always have. Only a few have been able to support themselves that way. There have always been trashy publications and well written ones. Just more of both now.

Of course, all of us need to sleep and maintain a healthier lifestyle. So it is such a relief for those people who suffer insomnia and already spending much for medicines against this condition to learn about Hypnosis.
But this time things were slightly better and my anxiety that not much had changed was soon relieved. in fact i was rather chuffed to see the difference it had made with all the values (techy science stuff that marc has to explain really slowly to me) jumping significantly in the right direction. importantly for ultras it appears that i've retrained my body to use much more fat as fuel than previously.*
However, do I think I'm a step above the rest for being on the bike? Not at all--since I couldn't even stay on the seat. A position, that no doubt left my escort quite uncomfortable as his gentleman parts were pressed against the very hot gas tank.

“Lets go.” we walk slowly in his direction. The closer I get to him the stronger his signal. Turning the corner he can see us coming down the darkened ally way. My hands glowing hot with anger. His palms are pressed flat on the building in front of him, trapping one of the human girls. The other two are shoving the petite one back and forth, taking terns groping her body. Her clothing tares as she struggles against them. Rex looks right at me, locking his eyes to mine. A smile slowly spreads on his face as he raps one hand around the girl’s neck. I push a wave of energy in there direction, but he ignores my warning. The other two freeze and the girl stumbles back from her attackers. She just stands there awkwardly waiting for her friend. Watching with tears in her eyes. Rex squeezes tighter on the teen’s fragile flesh, his smile growing ever wider. Pounding my feet against the pavement gaining momentum I land on his back with a jolting thud.
The downside is that we Americans are now obese. The genetically altered yellow corn is nearly all endosperm (the part that has the sugar/starch), and it wiped out all other varieties of corn from Mexico which had more proteins and nutrients. Plus, the cheapness and efficiency of corn farming led to the modern day factory farm (raising millions of cattle was not financially feasible before cheap corn), which makes our meat so much more fattening than the ol’ grass fed beef our grandparents ate. The picturesque farm that we envision no longer exists, thanks to Butz letting the corn fed genie out of the bottle.

Last year, I asked my husband how he wanted to celebrate our upcoming 25th Anniversary. I had envisioned a big party, renewing our vows, a second honeymoon etc. My husband didn't seem interested. I was very surprised but over the past year, I continued bringing the subject up to no avail. I was hurt. I didn't understand.
It’s the marketing that makes weirds us out slightly. Lady Gaga, for example, has been wearing vintage Versace almost exclusively over the past few weeks (it’s all she wears in her lackluster Edge of Glory video), and now we know that this arrangement wasn’t something she simply thought would be cool. It’s a genius marketing stunt that proves that, well, Gaga can be bought. H&M’s creative advisor Margareta van den Bosch said in a press release that some of the pieces in the collection would be inspired by archival Versace pieces — stuff Gianni Versace designed himself. What better way to help a younger customer base get acquainted with the man’s prints and leather work than to put it on the most visible consumer of fashion of our generation?

There is so much more to Mister MAN than I can ever imagine. I pray that Abba gives us many sunrises to say groggy good mornings and many moons to whisper sleepy good nights to each other. And I hope that all the hours in between will be peppered with experiences, conversations and moments that leave me thankful for, content with and admiring of my husband. I am honored to be his almost-wife, so it’s going to be downright awesome to be his forever-wife. I love what he stands for and what he aspires to be.

Charcut's spit-roasted meat of the day was Spring Creek Ranch steak. I ordered the steak and arugula salad. The size of the plate is impressive. The massive amount of arugula was dressed in a buttermilk vinaigrette and topped with a generous portion of perfectly done medium rare steak. Scads of deep fried onion abounded.

Today was a beautiful day. The rain subsided and the sun was out! I was the assistant minister at church today. This is my favorite season in the church year. It is hard to believe that Easter is just around the corner. The sermon was really good today, and our pastor talked about the fact that we constantly are having an internal battle of good and evil. She talked about the fact that when we decide to sin just a little, it becomes easier and easier to commit bigger and bigger sins. I agree that once someone starts doing something like lying, they have to tell bigger and bigger lies. However, I think conversely when you decide to do good, it becomes easier and easier to do good as well.

There was a group in Jesus’ time that was obsessed with the practice of spiritual disciplines – the Pharisees. They were crazy about rules. They had rules and rituals for everything, from how to behave on the Sabbath to how to wash your hands during a meal. They lived by an intense amount of rituals and rules. Take fasting for instance. The Pharisees fasted three days a week. Three days a week they skipped meals and prayed instead. I struggle to eat breakfast an hour late…much less skip three meals. And this was just the tip of their spiritual discipline ice berg.
Ranting and raving about society’s duty to continue supporting the most obtusely corrupt system in modern history only delays the inevitable…and hence delays the recovery. It takes a lot of courage, but a real Patriot would walk away.

“And too there were questions: What did he eat? Did he believe in isometrics? Isotonics? Ice and heat? How about aerobics, est, ESP, STP? What did he have to say about yoga, yogurt, Yogi Berra? What was his pulse rate, his blood pressure, his time for the 100-yard dash? What was the secret, they wanted to know; in a thousand different ways they wanted to know The Secret. And not one of them was prepared, truly prepared to believe that it had not so much to do with chemicals and zippy mental tricks as with that most unprofound and sometimes heartrending process of removing, molecule by molecule, the very tough rubber that comprised the bottoms of his training shoes.

The high point of this book is its world. There's nothing quite like it and I found it more and more interesting as the story progressed on. Although the whole story is set in a huge megastructure there is a lot of diversity in various levels that we see throughout the tale. Each level seems to contain its own genetically deformed humanoids and creatures of all kinds. The completely bleak art style gives a great representation of how massive and broken down this whole thing is. Apparently Nihei finished the school for architects so he knows how buildings work and his knowledge really shines here. The only thing that bothered me sometimes here is that sometimes the shading is so dark that you can't really tell what's going on but that could be due to bad scanning (some volumes aren't really scanned top notch).

I’m sorry to say, though, that in my experience many people who wear their Christianity on their sleeves (or on the back of their cars, as it were) frequently don’t appear to live up to the ideals they claim to espouse. This is certainly a case in point. A quick Google (by my son, not me–I was driving!) let us know the heart of this so-called Christian: May his days be few; may another take his office!
In the video, one fact jumps off the screen: 90% of students remembered advertising campaign slogans such as "Yo Quiero Taco Bell" and "Just Do It" but only 40% remembered that July 4th, 1776 was the date the United States declared independence. In the context of the video, this is meant to frighten us about the power of marketing and while I understand that sentiment, I think there is a much greater lesson to be learned. The lesson is that someone figured out how to get 90% of people to remember something. How did they do this?
I'm still waiting to hear the results from the interview, so I figured I should fill in the story behind this potential move. Because even if this opportunity doesn't work out, that won't be the end, I'm going to keep looking. It makes me sad to type that- unlike nearly everyone else I know, I like working for a big law firm. I genuinely like my job and I like the people I work with. But, for reasons outside my control, both of those statements are changing. And I think it's my responsibility to own my career and make changes before I become a victim of it.

Robert Aldrich made one of most people’s favorite war movies in The Dirty Dozen. In fact he made all kinds of great movies encompassing almost every genre. By 1956 he had turned out a handful of fine pictures, including Kiss Me Deadly and Vera Cruz. That year he turned his hand to the war movie and came up with the superior and intense Attack. This came at a time when the war film was transitioning from the flag-waving efforts of the forties to more bitter and realistic portrayals of combat.
