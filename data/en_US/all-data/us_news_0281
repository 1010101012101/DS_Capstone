Darryl Wolfe, who works for a consulting firm in Charlotte, chose a pat-down over a scan last year and regretted it. "I was shocked by the intensity and roughness of the pat-down," he told me. "In my mind at least, some of it was retribution for opting out. It was more like an assault."

So far it has not been possible to determine whether there is a particular anesthetic drug that is worse (or better) than others. This would allow us to modify the technique we use and limit any harmful effects. There is some evidence that the group of drugs called benzodiazepines -- Valium and Versed are examples -- are not a good choice in the elderly, however there are no clear best choices when it comes to drugs used for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia (a newer drug called dexmedetomidine is one possibility).

Obama made his appeal as Democratic leaders in Congress worked on a rescue plan for sweeping changes in health care that seemed earlier in the year to be on the brink of passage.

Michael Silver, Yahoo! Sports: "Given that Fisher and Snead went into Thursday's first round high on the potential of numerous players they felt were likely to be available in the first half of the second round – and with clear needs at, among other positions, receiver, running back, linebacker and cornerback – picking up an additional second-round selection was a clear goal. Yet the Rams would have been far less motivated to trade that sixth overall pick had Richardson or Blackmon been available. Despite the presence of three-time Pro Bowl halfback Steven Jackson on the roster, Fisher and Snead viewed Richardson as a potential star with rare talent and would have celebrated had he slipped to six."

However, I found the iPhone 4S worked better than the Galaxy Nexus in noisier environments. For instance, in a crowded shopping-mall food court, while neither phone was perfect, the iPhone understood me to say: "I am dictating this email from the very noisy Court at Montgomery Mall on the iPhone"—missing only the word "food" and capitalizing "Court." The Android phone mangled a very similar sentence as: "I am dictating this email on droid phone from the bearing noise for it montgomery mall."

The coach's response: "We're going to run 80-plus plays a game if things are working like they should. One running back cannot play 82 straight snaps. I've never had one do that, nor would we (ask anyone) to do that. We want to keep them fresh. I do see (Morrison), no question, as a power back. I see him as a second back in the backfield. Cam Marshall, in my opinion, if he can get trained (following minor ankle surgery this spring), he can be as good as there is in this conference and one of the best in the country. He fits our style of downhill running, but I think Tank is a guy that's going to contribute, no doubt about it, and they'll be some other ones come in that we're excited about."

You're fired: It's not unusual for a desperate candidate to clean house at headquarters. Sometimes it even works: Ronald Reagan (after losing in Iowa in 1980), John Kerry (with his numbers tanking in late 2007) and John McCain (when he ran out of money in the summer of 2007) all decapitated their campaigns and went on to at least win their party nominations. But Newt Gingrich being fired by his own staff? That's new. Many of the 16 strategists and consultants who walked out this week had been with Gingrich long enough that his undisciplined style couldn't have been a surprise, but his work habits might have been: After the Paul Ryan fiasco and with the GOP fight heating up, Gingrich and his wife went on a two-week cruise. Not a good message to send to the troops in the field. Gingrich insists he'll soldier on -- no doubt he expects to shine in Monday's New Hampshire debate -- but unlike Reagan's, Kerry's and McCain's, this shake-up isn't likely to have a happy ending.

The dishes draw from influences the world over, all the while ensuring the ingredients are gathered as locally as possible  the restaurant's tomatoes are even grown just beyond the edge of its back patio. Some interesting flavors to try: fig, prosciutto and blue brie skewers; paella balls made with seafood and chorizo and seasoned with saffron; and the sliced baguette, served alongside a pomegranate, pine nut and chevre cheese spread.

AUSTIN -- In a deeply personal keynote address to the South By Southwest Conference, Bruce Springsteen spoke passionately about the music that had had a profound impact on his own writing. The Boss rhapsodized about Elvis, James Brown, the Animals, and the Beatles, and the anecdotes he told about his encounters with each were revealing, mesmerizing, and sometimes hilarious. But it was the story of his awakening to Woody Guthrie's work that tells the most about how Springsteen's writing has changed over the last twenty years, and where he's likely to going next.

Durkin recalls how Olsen arrived at her audition with four giant suitcases — the accouterments of a frazzled college junior more than Hollywood royalty. "I think I had my detergent with me," Olsen said. She had had to move out of her apartment the same day, and though she'd stashed some things with Mary-Kate, she was heading to a film set and was essentially homeless.
In Greater Cleveland, Rep. Dennis Kucinich defeated GOP businessman Peter J. Corrigan of Rocky River and Rep. Marcia Fudge from Warrensville Heights trounced the Cleveland student she defeated two years ago, Thomas Pekarek. Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan of Niles bested Cortland GOP pharmacist Jim Graham. Ryan's predecessor, Jim Traficant of Poland, lost an independent bid for the seat after being ejected from Congress and spending seven years in prison on corruption charges.

"We hope having these forms online can help the center, families and investigators bring closure in cases that sadly ended in someone's death."
New Jersey staged a quasi-takeover of Atlantic City's casino and tourist zones; Christie called it "a partnership." But the new tourism zone is run by the state and takes charge of many functions Atlantic City's often dysfunctional municipal government had long struggled with, including safety, cleanliness and economic development. (At one point just a few years ago, four of the previous eight mayors of Atlantic City had been arrested on corruption charges.)

MUMBAI—Almost a decade ago, India's government, seeking to overcome one of the biggest challenges to the nation's development, set an ambitious goal: electric power for all by 2012.
"However," Dobson said in an email, "monitoring and auditing alone will not completely address the challenges in our supply chain. The root cause of the issues must be addressed and it will require bringing together a wide spectrum of stakeholders to develop innovative solutions to solve these very complicated issues."
We never lose our love of ice cream, but we can certainly move up to the adult version: ice cream infused with real liqueurs. How they get the liqueurs to freeze is, of course, a trade secret. But at this year-old shop, choose from a dozen rotating flavors spiked with such potables as Jack Daniels and Jamaican rum. We're trying the Black Russian, a base of chocolate ice cream mixed with kahlua ($3.75-$7 depending on scoops). Six non-alcoholic varieties are also available for kids and teetotalers.
Gingrich's ex-wife burst into the campaign this week when she alleged in an ABC News interview that her former husband had asked her for an "open marriage," a potentially damaging claim in a state where the Republican primary electorate includes a potent segment of Christian conservatives.

Seth and Alicia met at Benedictine College, where they both played sports. They have two sons, Gibson, 9, and Anders, 5. The family lives in a raised ranch with a big backyard. It’s what most people would consider a starter house, but they’ve made it a home they see living in for years by adding landscaping and building a deck. Seth likes to grill while the family watches games on the TV they’ve dragged outside.
During a Jan. 21 speech to Ohio EPA workers, the governor recalled the day three years ago when he was given the ticket. In telling the story, Kasich, who took office on Jan. 10, three times referred to the Columbus police officer who ticketed him as an idiot as seen in this video:

There was a small ray of hope from the mound. Reliever Adam Ottavino, making his Rockies debut, pitched two perfect innings, striking out two.
Technically, the Keys won't be the first act to play at Revel, either. The hotel is opening a second performance space called the Social, a smaller room than the 5000-seat Ovation Hall. (This is likely to be similar to the division at the Borgata -- the Event Center handles the really big acts, and the Music Box takes care of the more intimate shows.) Revel is planning a soft opening -- they're calling it an eight-week preview -- on Apr. 2, and the casino is marking the occasion with a Social performance by Danish noise-pop the Raveonettes.
Bob Seger (ditto the parents again) sings, "Come back, baby, cause rock 'n' roll never forgets," and when you hear people say, "I love that song," or "That's my favorite band," a lot of what they are saying is that the music reminds them of the friends and places associated with it.

I saw hundreds of concert sets in 2011. With respect to Paul Simon, Elvis Costello, Eisley at Bamboozle, the Throne, and Freddie Gibbs, the very best of them was Steely Dan at the Beacon Theatre. They were playing to the converted: I have been an admirer of all things Dan since I was in junior high school. Donald Fagen, whose range was never too great to begin with, is down to about three notes, all of them raspy. It didn't matter. The band was so great, and so joyous, that the entire show felt like a celebration.

The birth of Snow’s hydrocephalitic daughter Valerie is often cited as the reason for the singer’s partial withdrawal from the spotlight. Snow refused to institutionalize Valerie, who died in 2007 at the age of 31, instead opting to care for her at home. But there is reason to believe that Snow was never entirely comfortable with the glamour and flash of the music business. "Second Childhood," her 1976 follow-up to her debut, was a denser, artier set with no obvious singles. "Cash In," the second cut, was a hard look askance at an industry she had little patience for. "How much did you get for your soul/When you rock ’n’ roll?", it asked.
The latest warning notes that 47,515 people were killed in narcotics-related violence in Mexico between Dec. 1, 2006 and Sept. 30, 2011. The number of U.S. citizens reported to the Department of State as murdered in Mexico jumped from 35 in 2007 to 120 in 2011.
Between fare evasion and broken ticket vending machines, TriMet is forfeiting a substantial amount of revenue on the MAX system. A priority should be to fix that system and realize lost revenue rather than leave the system as it is and cut Fareless Square's services. Visible and frequent fare enforcement -- as opposed to the nationally low rates of fare inspection we currently have -- alongside fully operational vending machines would be enough to pay for the enforcement structure and increase overall revenue.

30. Ask West Portal natives where they eat several times in a week, and the answer you'll probably get is Sub Center.

GM and government engineers are working together to determine the exact reason for the fires, Barra told the Automotive Press Association.

CBS televised the Super Bowl a couple months ago, and McManus said the New Orleans-Indianapolis matchup created some angst at the network because there were no big-market teams involved. But the story of everything New Orleans has gone through in recent years and the importance of the Saints to that city made for a great story line that sparked national interest. CBS ended up with the most-watched program in U.S. television history.

The last two fights were not the best examples of Alexander's work and, with a victory potentially pushing him toward bigger and bigger fights, he's eager to win and show he's an attractive and appealing fighter.

However, he has previously said the best way for Atlantic City to fight off out-of-state competition is to emphasize things that most racetrack slots don't have -- such as oceanfront hotels, top-name entertainment, gourmet restaurants and spas -- that are designed to attract people for several days instead of several hours.

Ultimately, the real problem isn't impounds but unlicensed drivers. That's why we applaud Beck's comments this week acknowledging that the longer-term solution is to allow undocumented immigrants to obtain provisional or nonresident California driver's licenses. It's a smart approach to public safety. As Beck told The Times' editorial board: "Why wouldn't you want to put people through a rigorous testing process?"
"I was really disappointed to see him carry on that way," Azinger said. "He's not trying to endear himself to anybody. And after he won Bay Hill, I thought, 'Here we go again, this is going to be Tiger just kicking butt and taking names.' I don't know. I thought he acted like the south end of a northbound mule."

Science dropped its first set in league play this week against Bronx Leadership, but that shouldn’t be cause for concern. In fact, the Wolverines should get an infusion heading into the playoffs with the return of star middle hitter Alex Barbulescu (ankle).

Using libraries, archives, museums and oral history interviews, students research, then analyze and interpret their findings, draw conclusions about their topics' significance in history and create final projects that present their work.
A number of nationally recognized authors will offer their perspectives, as well as several local ones. For instance, Corona del Mar resident Barbara DeMarco-Barrett, author of "Pen on Fire: A Busy Woman's Guide to Igniting the Writer Within" (2004) and host of the KUCI (88.9 FM) show "Writers on Writing," will moderate a panel on writing memoirs.

"Everything on the course has been either redone or revamped. Nothing has been left untouched; everything has been upgraded,'' said Debbie Adams, who had not been involved for years with the event but came back to resurrect it when it got cancelled earlier this season. She was able to get it reinstated on the schedule, but only beginner novice, novice and training levels are running this year. Adams expects preliminary level to return in 2011.
Suddenly, the season doesn't look so lost.
Finally, in the midst of their research, the Salengers turned to 30 friends, surveying them about essential "dream home" features. The two knew what was important to them, but wanted to make sure their investment would also have resale appeal (more than, say, inflatable rooms or sleeping pods).

I don't fault the house. I'll surely smell musty, too, when I'm 130 years old. I just hope someone douses me in Estee Lauder's finest.
If not a writing talent, we do have some other similarities. In his Wednesday, April 18 article Bill points out how he did so many dumb things as a young man attending college. Bill admits he spent most of his time playing cards and drinking beer. We have a lot in common here. So many young students still do the same or something similar. I think it might be called immaturity.
"I felt good. Obviously I wasn't good enough, but the back-to-back homers didn't help the cause," Hanson said. "That was all they needed."

When he returned to the game, he ran two plays before the costly interception.

Reporters found that doctors who provide substandard care often continue to practice without public action by regulators. Regulators increasingly rely on nonpublic "letters of concern" to doctors, which are not considered discipline. Their use has grown from 20 letters a year in 1986 to 910 in 2006.

I wonder if we will start to see a branding trend. Planning a wedding is a bit like running a business (or in this case, a pop-up shop) and having a clear mission and consistent message is Marketing 101. It gives the bride an outline for her wedding, and makes it easier to fill in the pieces, while keeping it personal.
Gilani's conviction in a court of law means there are now grounds to initiate dismissal proceedings, which involves the speaker of the parliament and the election commission. It could take up to four months and be fiercely contested every step of the way.

... I don't want to come across complaining about the budget because I'm not. I'm like a startup. ... I'm looking at the world from a very different perspective with resources. The resources are out there, you just have to find them. Austerity is the moment that we're living in. That doesn't mean that you can't find partners and like-minded people. In the next month or two, we'll roll out what we're doing on economic development that will show we're going to connect resources up and down the state.

Instructions: Combine the garlic and salt in a mortar, and use the pestle to mash them together until a paste forms. (The salt acts as little knives and helps crush the garlic.) Add the anchovies and mash into the paste. Add the olive oil in a slow stream, mashing, until the consistency of a thick sauce. Stir in the parsley.

After 2008, the district reinvented its model, cut its funding and began charging for all its classes, Beller said.
Parents of some of the boys turned over information about the alleged plot to the Eagle County Sheriff's Office and Basalt Police Department. No kidnapping or assault took place. The parents found a hand-drawn map of Arbaney Park and notes that indicated something was going to happen, suspecting it was a drug deal, police said. Investigators with Eagle County and Basalt said they uncovered the real plot by talking to juveniles and getting an alleged confession from the boy they identified as the prime suspect.

The last time Woods and McDowell played in the final group, McDowell beat Woods in a playoff in the Chevron World Challenge at the end of 2010.
"The governor can't order the state to search people's bodily fluids for no reason - the Constitution prohibits that sort of government intrusion," said Howard Simon, executive director of the ACLU of Florida.

The considerable charm of what might otherwise be a tedious post-colonial history lesson lies with José, a character whose appeal grows as he meanders through a wry, wistful, occasionally bitter chronicle of a century of violent, convoluted Colombian history.
The Panthers thought they were on the board 1:50 into the third period when Mike Weaver's shot from the right point got past Brodeur. Shawn Matthias was whistled for goaltender interference, nullifying the goal — and further firing up the desperate Panthers.

Washington’s Farewell Address (issued as a public letter in 1796) was one of the most influential statements of republicanism. Drafted primarily by Washington himself, with help from Hamilton, it gives advice on the necessity and importance of national union, the value of the Constitution and the rule of law, the evils of political parties, and the proper virtues of a republican people. He called morality “a necessary spring of popular government.” He said, “Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle. (George Washington)
Air traffic controllers have been under recent scrutiny, fueled by reports of controllers sleeping on the job or subject to other distractions. The number of controller-reported errors jumped 53 percent between 2009 and 2010, according to the inspector general for the Department of Transportation. Royal did not comment on how he or the base feels about the attention air traffic controllers are receiving nationwide.

Minnesota's commissioners of transportation, public safety and health state that "illegal or unsafe speed is the most-cited factor in fatal crashes" and that "almost one-third of all traffic fatalities are related to speed." But they do not cite any studies to support these statements.
What the Internet can’t match when it comes to the Yellow Pages are the pages of public services listed at the front, city by city listings for water and power emergencies, diagrams of sports venues like Dodger Stadium and the Coliseum, great freeway maps, city street guides and government services that include San Gabriel’s code enforcement department as well as the phone number for the damaged currency department at the U.S. Mint in Washington, D.C., just in case the dog ate half of your wallet.

I read the letter “Church’s moral outrage might be misplaced” (Feb. 12), in which the author said he was disappointed that Catholic Church leaders so strongly opposed the Obama administration’s latest regulation to require birth control and abortion drugs to be provided by health insurers. The writer says he doesn’t understand why there is so much fuss. At the same time, he claims to be a Catholic.
Explosive levels of illegal immigration have overwhelmed the resources of Arizona, California and elsewhere. How does the country stay afloat when the top 1 percent of the earners pay 37 percent of federal income tax, and 60 percent of Americans collect more in government services than they pay in?
Writer-director Craig Moss, who previously made a number of parody films including the "Twilight" sendup "Breaking Wind," shrewdly pitches the movie in such a way that it's often difficult to tell what's bad on purpose or just badly handled. The cargo shorts and fanny pack? Purposely funny. The slack pacing? Probably not. The grasping at straws, stretch-it-out feel of the extended plot? Maybe? (And for fans of the original video, there is even the signature mispronunciation of "ambulance" as "Amber Lamps.") Though there seems to be some digital embellishment to the frequent fighting, with additional spurts of blood after punches, the obvious body-doubles with bad wigs keep the violence from ever getting too intense.
Gardenhire said the Twins "looked like Little Leaguers out there, and that’s a bunch of (expletive)." Then he walked out of the visiting managers’ office. "OK, that’s enough. I’m not going to go any farther. Have a good night. Congratulations, Mr. Weaver."
Fraser intends to plant a garden — and not just a few containers of herbs, but 450 to 500 square feet, right outside, cater-corner from Los Angeles Police Department headquarters. It will be tended by the kitchen staff, and Fraser says it could yield as much as a quarter of the produce for his kitchen. He's eyeing a parking lot for more garden space.
A few weeks ago, a builder purchased the property at Southeast Woodward Street and 35th Place. A wrecking crew moved in to tear down all structures, including the 1931 brick building with WAVERLY over the front door.

But NOAA scientists, who have jurisdiction over the mammals, argued the dolphins appeared to be trying to extend the northern range of their winter habitat and should be left alone, even if that meant some died.
The two school districts, which border one another at the southern end of Somerset County, are the only ones in the county that did not move school elections to coincide with the general election in November. That means they're also the only ones in the county to give voters the opportunity to reject their proposed 2012-13 school year budget levies.

What advice would you give to the incoming freshman at your school? To never settle. There is always room for improvement in every aspect of life and everyone should strive to reach the next level in everything they do.
SAN DIEGO — A month into the season, patience is rapidly reaching an expiration date. Nobody who isn't drinking purple Kool-Aid thought the Rockies were going to lead the National League West at this point, but the idea they could be buried this month is unacceptable.
A spokesperson for the Wynn resorts, Jennifer Dunne, says Hilton will not longer be allowed on the properties. Dunne also said Waits has been dismissed as the nighclub manager at the Tryst Nightclub at Wynn and XS The Nightclub at Encore.
The second Waffle Window, which might not immediately have an actual ordering window, is on pace for a May opening, Fishback wrote.
Simmons doesn't play with the memory-vs-reality theme like Philip K. Dick; in the end, in fact, he's much closer to that lyrical devourer of madeleines, Proust. Even if their approaches are radically different, they share a common theme: Life is so full of disappointment, and time moves so swiftly, that memory enables us to recapture those special, transcendent moments in our lives.
Front-drive CVT models are rated 29 mpg in combined city/highway driving. The stick-shift, front-drive Juke and the all-wheel-drive CVT model both return 27 mpg. Those are impressive figures: The front-drive Juke falls just 1 or 2 mpg short of what many entry-level hatchbacks achieve. Alas, Nissan recommends premium fuel, which diminishes the mileage figures' appeal.
Tommy Morrissey agreed. He was making quick sales this afternoon with $1 water bottles for the sweaty dessert-lovers.
Ricigliano, in a brief interview, called the suspension a "dramatic" but necessary step she did not take lightly. She said Deputy Chief Carmelo Vaticano would oversee the department in Bryan’s absence.
Booker pulled the woman from her bed and brought her to safety, injuring his hands in the process. Booker was treated for smoke inhalation and suffered second-degree burns on his hands.
I was 9 years old when Title IX was passed and have seen the impact it has had on women my age (soon to be 49) and the next generation, as I have a 15-year-old daughter. I feel like the Title IX ship kind of passed me by, but it has had a great impact on the women of my generation in supporting and encouraging our daughters. And in doing that, it encouraged me to get off the couch and into the game myself.
The first scoring chance for the Kickers came in the fourth minute when forward Edson Elcock attempted a blast from 10 yards that Gallardo deflected out of the box.
Outside the courthouse, the battlefield is a lot less defined as Missouri's public defenders take steps to widen a work slowdown that had drawn the wrath of some prosecutors.
All of the student artists who participated in the show are taught by Karen Akashi and Jackie Peters of Beckman High School; Jeff Gillette, Richard Boyes and Art Rausch of Foothill High School; Molly Baross of Hillview High School; and Faith Peay, MaryJo Rado and Dennis Boucher of Tustin High School.

Co-testing is powerful because each exam screens for slightly different things, experts said. The HPV test detects only viral infection that over time can cause cancer in some women. Pap smears, meanwhile, detect precancerous cells that should be treated to prevent cancer.
By Monday, senior Draymond Green had talked to Kearney, too.
Joe Stalin might understand. When ordinary East Germans revolted in 1953 against their Communist dictators, the writer Bertolt Brecht (himself pink as a salmon, but not entirely humorless) suggested that perhaps the political "problem" wasn't really the East German government; instead, maybe it was East German voters. If so, rather than change the government, "Would it not be easier . . . for the government to dissolve the people and elect another?"
Mr. Barbieri boasted two Michelin stars at both Trigabolo d'Argenta and Ristorante Arquade in Relais & Châteaux's Villa del Quar in his native Italy, where he is considered something of a personality, making regular appearances as a judge on the Italian version of "MasterChef." His food is innovative without being experimental or avant-garde, but includes sophisticated touches that veer toward contemporary French cuisine, such as rooster stuffed with foie gras de canard or grilled Angus fillet with chard and Béarnaise sauce. Still, he is well-versed in classical Italian cuisine, with exquisite dishes such as tartare of Piemontese beef cured in spices, goat cheese and pistachio fondue, or pan-seared sea bass with mozzarella and aubergine cake.
"Raising interest rates is what the Chinese need to do when they have such an overheated economy," he said.

Jason Pierre-Paul, who had earlier recorded his fifth sack in four games, was shielded from Brady by both tackle Sebastian Vollmer and guard Brian Waters. Chris Canty was occupied by three blockers. Osi Umenyiora had issues when he tried to loop around those four.

Do you realize that just in the first two hours of this cleanout, we've discovered the desiccated bodies of seven Clippys who got trapped under piles of menus and controls, and slowly starved to death?

The California Housing Finance Agency, which runs the program, says that starting in early June, it will no longer require servicers to provide a matching reduction, although they will have to modify the loan by reducing the interest rate, extending the term or both.

"All chain stores are not created alike," said Jon Golinger, president of the Telegraph Hill Dwellers, a neighborhood group.

Nor do they have the benefit of having strong careers built on good work. Wayne survived being John Wayne while trying to play Genghis Khan in "The Conqueror," as Costner survived being Kevin Costner playing Robin Hood in "Prince of Thieves." Mickey Rooney survived playing the Mr. Yunioshi character, complete with every ugly Japanese stereotype, in "Breakfast at Tiffany's." Even Adam Sandler's résumé of delinquent goofiness (there's definitely a market for it) saved him from thinking he could play a former NFL quarterback in the remake of "The Longest Yard."

President Obama's trip, including a speech to Americans from Kabul, featured a commitment to an American presence in Afghanistan until 2024.

What if Marvel gave a party and everybody came? That's the organizing principle of "The Avengers," the much-anticipated, hugely hyped, immensely expensive and fitfully enjoyable (with an asterisk) convocation of comic book superheroes in which Iron Man, Captain America, the Incredible Hulk, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye team up to save the world. I'll explain the asterisk later.

The Blues have been on the market since May 2010, when TowerBrook Capital Partners announced it was divesting its 70 percent share of the team. Dave Checketts, who owned 20 percent of the team and ran the club, tried to buy the rest of it, but that deal fell through. He then tried to sell it to Chicago businessman Matthew Hulsizer, but that deal wasn't finalized within the league-alloted period. A minority owner of the team, Stillman signed a purchase agreement for the team Jan. 20, and while his negotiating period has expired, the league has continued talks with him on the sale.
broadcasts back to powerhouse KMOX (1120 AM) after a five-year experiment at KTRS (550 AM) led to grousing from people who were unable to pick up the signal. But they went the other way with their TV coverage, leaving over-the-air (so-called free TV) for the first time since they began televising games in the 1940s. The lure was a bigger offer from cable's Fox Sports Midwest - which, for the second year in a row, flubbed coverage of the home opener. This time it cut away while the Cards were being introduced..

If the proceeds from the sale of your home, and other funds you have available, will not enable you to buy your next home, you may want to save some money before moving forward with the sale of your home.

I feel that we have been able to put the money that we have up on the stage and offer consistent programming that people have seemed to walk away enjoying.
