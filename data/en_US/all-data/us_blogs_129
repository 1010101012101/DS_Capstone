Perhaps the classic was we were defending a major oil company against a breach of contract suit when it stopped selling to a chain of gas stations because the stations were selling unbranded gas under the name of the oil company. The owner of the stations sued to $10 million or so. When we looked at the financials, we found out that he was losing money on every gallon he sold and that the cessation of sales was actually a good thing for him because it kept him from going deeper into debt. It was a jury trial and everyone agreed that the jury would not award nothing, so we stopped at a damage amount of $500,000. The jury agreed and the case was over. Or so we thought.
He will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water. So now, here’s a man who has the desire’s of his heart and he’s compared to a piece of wood; this must be some tree. The tree being planted by the streams of water will always have rich soil to drain nutrients from. The best place for a tree. Spurgeon writes in Treasury of David, “not a wild tree, but “a tree planted,” chosen, considered as property, cultivated and secured from the last terrible uprooting, for “every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up:” Matthew 15:13. “By the rivers of water;” so that even if one river should fail, he hath another. The rivers of pardon and the rivers of grace, the rivers of the promise and the rivers of communion with Christ, are never-failing sources of supply.”

The writing workshop I've been taking is good. It's purpose is not so much to hone your writing skills as it is to "get in the chair" (as our instructor puts it) and write. Find your voice.

Matt Damon’s character in the movie taught his children a profound lesson about stepping outside of their comfort zone. He stated that he had lived his life adhering to a mantra: to step up and embrace pivotal moments when life-changing opportunities presented themselves, by mustering “twenty seconds of insane courage.” The more I considered this piece of advice, the more I came to the realization that it’s absolutely true.

GF commented on the recent reaction to Obama’s same sex marriage support. “The entire justification I hear for being against same sex marriage is what is provided in the Bible. There is no other argument, if you can call that an argument at all. It’s the same argument Brady (William Jennings Bryan) makes in the play against teaching evolution.”

Baby Q is having a really tough night. He wasn't able to fall asleep on his own like he has the past few days. When I put him down to sleep after our routine (teeth, PJs, and sippy with water), he just screamed and screamed. I ended up crawling into the crib with him and slowly inched away as he relaxed. Oddly, my cosleeping-nursing-to-sleep-Ella fell asleep alone in my bed while she patiently waited for me. He has been up at least 3 times for an extended period. DH has paced with him but he is too heavy to walk to sleep. Right now, DH is sitting with him while he cries, rubbing his back. I have been reading foster care/adoption articles while they try to work it out. If he was adopted, I'd put him in my bed. But, that is against the rules for a foster parent. Also, if his bio mom isn't going to cosleep and he is truly used to crib sleeping, then I don't want to disrupt that pattern. I am so angry at his previous foster mom right now for not telling us what his night time routine was like.

I had a few errands to run today....business to take care of before I start my new job. I took the camera along 'cause I knew I was going to be stopping at McKinley Park and thought I might sneak in a few photos. I forget how lovely Sacramento's Mid-Town is. I forget that although it's NOT San Francisco, it is a CITY and has a little bit of the feel of some of S.F.'s neighborhoods do. I guess if I really wanted to 'move to the city' I could practice in a little place in Mid-Town Sac and see how I adapt. In suburbia things are so EASY and VANILLA. I'm not sure I'm going to be able to convey what I mean.....it's like everything is prepackaged and nothing has any charm or flavor. Yeah, that covers it, sort of. And, in all seriousness, I'm pretty accustomed to easy and vanilla. I might find that not having ready made within spitting distance from my home is something I don't like. But, I still wonder on occasion what it would be like to live the city life. This line of thought comes from spending time in the area hospitals in the last couple of weeks on Mended Little Hearts business. Getting set up as a volunteer at two of the major pediatric heart centers had me downtown 4 days last week. Driving around down there got me thinking about maybe I would find myself needing to be close to one or both of these hospitals. I digress....McKinley Park and the surrounding area was delightful today and I took the time to enjoy it.
When I read about some of the bizarre games-and-travails of these British royal groupies, it makes me think of that line.

It's a very Catholic idea. Give God your youth and your beauty. When you see young men and women, in the prime of life, handsome, beautiful, smiling, raidiant with joy, and they give it all up to be united with God as a priest or religious, what do you think? Catholics see it as a gift of something precious and beautiful. Some folks might sigh and say, "What a waste," but Catholics see it as giving it all to God. These courageous, generous men and women have chosen to give everything they have to God. They even give the things we think belong to us alone, like youth and beauty.

I miss the simple stuff. I miss going to dollar day at the thrift store together. I miss swimming in the pool in her backyard with all our kids. I miss hearing her play piano and sing. I miss sitting on her couch and smelling the vanilla soy candles. I miss our drive-thru adventures at Bakers getting an ice-cream cherry shake. I miss hearing her advice about how to handle my tough little boy. I miss baking chocolate chip cookies and eating them fresh out of the oven. I miss seeing my kids play "Little House on The Prarie" with their cousins. I miss Christmas at her house. I miss her white roses at the front porch. I miss her green grass and big tree in the front yard. I miss our sleepovers and late night talks. I miss calling her at any time of day. I miss sitting in the sunshine, sipping her famous Lipton tea. I miss our memories.
Measuring and examining over the nurse walked me the few steps back to the waiting room and continued with her work, part of which seemed to be popping back occasionally to check on the mood of the waiting room and keep people updated on the wait. The staff were keeping the waiting room updated after each patient came out, and at one point another nurse offered to make me a cup of tea. If you're a 'not yet disabled' person who's sat in a hospital waiting room and wondered why the occasional patient gets brought a hot drink its because well trained, caring medical staff can spot the patients who aren't able to go off and get their own drinks and often look like they could do with a good meal. Or patients who the staff don't want to let go off alone because it'll make them more poorly. Outpatients is a bit of an odd place to work as a nurse, you get judged by ward nurses as it's perceived as 'easy' but the potential for patients shouting is just as high as on a ward. What outpatients don't tend to get is the experience of much continuing care, so the nurses usually know any of the long term patients. In Dr Freak's clinic, the outpatient nurses usually greet me with a big hug, because of the gap between appointments they get to see patients conditions fluctuate in a way many other staff don't and so delight in any progress made, however minor.

And sometimes we would just sit at the amphitheater in silence, watching the squid boats glow like candles off in the sea as the wind lashed the trees in front of us. I remember one night, we got lost in a maze of low-slung clusters of houses down by the shore. We ended up clambering over the roofs, chasing the water as we tried to navigate the dense network of cramped streets and shanty-like houses that seemed to almost tumble down the steep hills that led to the sea. When we finally reached the shore, we just lay down on the sand and fell asleep, we were so exhausted. On another of our nights together not long after, we were at the beach and I lost every electronic device I had to the sea — phone, iPod, camera, gone forever. I didn't even care. I think I knew then that I loved him.
I note for the sake of completeness that in spite of the alleged induction of some sort of monkey-autism-via-vaccines, these monkeys appeared to survive on a diet containing casein -- 40% casein, as a matter of fact -- and biscuits containing wheat gluten. Just wondering why the autistic enterocolitis didn't afflict these poor macaques in spite of that MMR vax. Poor macaques that, by the way, were removed from their mothers at birth and kept separate from each other with no physical contact. And for what? To test them with the carefully selected -- oh, let's just call it cherry picked, shall we? -- "1994-1999 vaccine schedule." I'd like to see the IACUC justification for this one.

Many minors now experience regular harassment in our schools and kindergartens simply because they happen to belong to the country’s native ethnic population, who are gradually being displaced from their homeland as a result of the current immigration policies. It is sheer hypocrisy when Jonas Gahr Støre and other members of the Norwegian peace industry turn their backs on children whose childhoods are ruined as a result of violence and harassment from immigrant gangs. We should ensure that we have a safe environment for our own kids before we start lecturing the rest of the world on how they should behave.

The Read Cat Bookstore in Clearfield has been an amazing source of comfort for thousands of residents living in Utah. Although the economic times have been tough, people always knew they could go there for good conversation and reasonably priced books. Through this bookstore, many children have developed a love of reading. Residents realized they could still afford to buy quality books. The place has the most helpful staff and wonderful selection of new and used literature, but unfortunately they are closing their doors and moving far away.
I do agree that male designers tend to make a greater impact with accessories, but, when it comes to clothing, I have to disagree and say the females make a bigger impact. If women were to design for what they want to wear, it makes sense to me. Women will be the ones buying it; therefore, they should make a bigger impact. Women know what other women want to wear. They’ve worn skirts and know how amazing it is to have pockets, or have worn annoying jeans that have just a bit too much material in the front. They know what we gripe about because they’ve dealt with it firsthand.

Without delay the PC’s struck, surrounding the goblins from the woods and opening fire with crossbows, bow and magic. Leaf sneaking up on otherwise engaged goblins dispatched one with a single blow, panicking his partner who tried to run and got an arrow in the spine for his troubles from Fel’s longbow. The PC’s were not unscathed, one of the goblin sentries had aim enough to hit Fel with a spear. The injury wasn’t serious and in perfect movie fashion, Fel simply shrugged it off and went back to the job of clearing these goblins. Continuing his run as sneak of the group, Leaf manages to knock out the goblin’s leader and drop another body on him, keeping him for later and Gwig’s mace knocked the life from another. Within moments the fight is done and the PC’s catch their breath looking over the scene.

“Gentle people of the Earth, with the destruction of the Oaxaca Cabal base, all negativite entity vessels have been eliminated or have retreated from the skies of Mexico. Ground battles are almost complete by the valiant Knights of the White Heart and the Brethren of the White Robe. Two Plejaran lives were lost in the confrontation. While we mourn for this loss, we rejoice their lives well in the service of light, and look forward to meeting our fallen friends in their next incarnation. We are all aware of the risks when volunteering for this mission, cleansing the planet Earth of the rule of Dracos so that humanity may evolve with love and peace into Fifth Density Consciousness. The fight is far from over; during the next several days, and throughout the year you call 2012, many conflicts will occur, and much pain and sadness is unavoidable. We will do what we can, as Creation Law allows; you must do what you can to assist the planet Earth in her battle to survive the tyranny of darkness.”
‘One minute they act as if they want to be in a relationship the next minute they’re not sure’,” she would add. I thought I agreed with this statement, until recently. All men are not confused, all the time when it comes to dating and pursuing a woman.

Some women also use men for temporary periods knowing that he is not Mr.Right, despite his interest in becoming so.

Well guess what? Only one team wins, and, two weeks ago, that was my team! Questions were comprised fairly easy sports, celebrity, movie, and pop culture trivia. Positive: Big beers are super cheap and half price during trivia. Negative: Too much time was alloted for each question and in between rounds.
Back to that chance joke--a friend of the old Bean suggested that Higgs Boson was also, coincidentally, the name of a Red Sox second baseman.

(One of the greatest ironies, of course, is that gun sales in Arizona rose dramatically after the shooting because subsequent gun control laws were feared.

My first wander around Scotswood was in 2006 and the area was in a terrible rundown state. On my latest visit in 2010 I was suprised at how much of the area has been demolished and the few remaining streets looked very tidy and quiet, not the picture of Scotswood that the media continuously portray. Large parts of the area are now what I call ghost streets after the demolition of whole streets of houses but the roads remain and it gives quite a sad, strange effect.

In fact Madoff’s super Ponzi scheme has all the hallmarks of audacity with which the 9/11 terrorist attacks were carried out. Without the help, cooperation and influence of the Zionist mafia the gang that planned and carried out the demolition of the World Trade Center Towers in NYC couldn’t have gotten away with it.
I continually work hard at work so I can make Pa proud. When it comes to it, sometimes half of my check goes back to my family. Am I mad sometimes? Yes, because it has hindered me from saving up for this summer. But I wouldn’t change it. It’s what family is for. Pa luckily now has money more, the market is picking up and his company is finding jobs more frequently.

I really liked the movie btw, it's been a long while since I read the books and because my collegue borrowed them, I didn't get the chance to re-read them before the movie. But it did feel like all the important/interesting scenes were there, as fas as I could remember. I really liked the cast aswell, which is pretty unusal for me. Most of the time, I give characters such a personal image, that actors almost never match for me. But now, they just felt right. (Then again, I liked the books, but didn't -love- them, so that is different aswell.) That being said, I couldn't really remember all the details about everyone, so I'm not sure if they were close to the book. But the characters -felt- right, and I liked the movie a lot more than I thought I would. Sid hadn't read the book and he liked it aswell, he's going to read the books as soon as I get them back.

Such as this morning. I made a cup of tea and sat for 30 minutes watching what was in or flying over my garden. House sparrows were in evidence of course (I always scan every bird looking for tree sparrows, which while very rare in this area are nonetheless here in single numbers - I'm still waiting, ever hopefull). Blackbird and starling, collared dove too. But then I noticed beyond the garden line with the aid of binoculars, herring gull, magpie, rook, carrion crow, buzzard, 3 goldfinch, a green finch and finally a swallow, first I've seen here this year

In any case, "Still Searching" is worth a read and I admire its ambition. Check it out and see what you think.

Jeanette is wonderfully polite and her beautiful smile engaging, but at times she drifts in and out of substantive conversation. So I began to sing a couple hymns to draw her back. Rather than join in singing, as I had hoped, she just took it all in and as she did, tears began to slowly trail down her cheeks. She expressed her appreciation and pointed to a tissue lying on the sofa. I picked it up and gently wiped her tears. Then she pointed to her nose reminding me that it also needed attention.
Saints fans, you know your team is still good and will be capable of competing in all of their games, but an 8-8, 9-7, 10-6 mark this year is not the ideal finish. Remember that as part of the NFL sanctions the Saints will lose a 2013 second round pick. This means that a playoff or .500 season gives you somewhere in that No. 20 – No. 30 pick then nothing until Round 3.

He’s a Teacher – Not a One Line Politician - I respect this. Whether it is something positive, or something we’d rather not think about, there is substance in what he says. It is too serious to be summed up in a sound bite. His speeches in Congress and elsewhere make you think. He Cares more for this country than his political career - He is willing to say what must be said, without regard to the political fallout. He’s willing to put some different ideas out there, and accept the ridicule. He doesn’t change his stance because some find it unpopular. If given the opportunity to lead this country, his decisions would be made in the best interest of the American people and would take his Oath of Office seriously.

But he was really a good guy, he was interested, and those are the best people, so I would go back. So I did, and horrible little boy in front of me started in on what seemed like an unknown until me at this moment routine. I also have to say, this was 100 years ago, and I hope to God this isn’t happening now. It is certainly not what I have seen with Tomtom’s peers. To put it in context though, when this was happening there were also people willing to put bumper-stickers on their cars with very rude caricatures of Asians in those triangle rice-pickers hats behind a wheel that said something like “no nip drivers” I mean there is huge history of American aggression based racism, that I don’t know about. I have read, “No-No Boy” Because I found it at a used bookstore. So read it if you can. So important. I would put it on the level of Ralph Ellison’s “Invisible Man” Really that good, really that important, but doesn’t get as much play.
To be honest, it’s difficult to explain or pinpoint exactly how this is done.
After my first miscarriage I had a son, after my second I had a daughter. He's two years old and she's three weeks old and the facts of it are that without those miscarriages I wouldn't have either of them because they were conceived at times when, all going to plan, I would have been due to give birth. But the facts of it are also that the care I received was awful and I'm not the only one to have been treated so which makes it even worse, an isolated case can be excused as such but when countless women share the same stories there is no excuse.
Parenthood is a lot more fun than the sappy Brothers & Sisters; it’s more like a longer, less funny Modern Family, only not really. Hey, it’s sort of like that movie from the late 80’s, you know the one, Steve Martin was in, yeah that’s it – Roxanne. As long as Parenthood can keep its head above water there’s enough on offer here for the show to turn into something quite touching and enjoyable. I’m going to throw this word out there – potential. Parenthood has a lot of potential; here’s hoping it actually uses it.

To wean me off from being propped nightly over my mother's familiar heartbeat, my parents suspended a musical mobile over my cot. Rather than conduct me to sleep however, it merely set my gums on edge (later explained away as 'teething'), since its lullabies sounded nothing like the sweet harmonies of my mother. But then even when she sang while I clung to her stomach as we bathed together, that didn't sound quite how I was used to hearing her either. Perhaps it was the accentuating acoustics of the porcelain tiles. More likely it was because bath water couldn't replicate amnion as a modulating medium.
Actually, those speculating on Israel’s danger ask the wrong question. The real matter up for discussion is not about Israel’s survival, but whether the West will prevail against the assault by Islamism. Because the fate of the West is bound to that of Israel's by the iron chains of history.
I think that if I were hip and cool and said things like fetch and that's sick, I would be trying to express that that's awesome... or rad, if you wanna go retro. But all that that's sick makes me think of is sick days. And how much I miss them. I know, here's my mom card.
It is the small things that usually trips me up - the children's’ stories and songs that I haven’t heard, and the ones that I grew up with instead (would you believe that most Danish children don’t grow up with neither The Wizard of Oz nor Snugglepot and Cuddlepie?) - but it is also the inability of many to look beyond the borders, and think globally. The distrust of foreign things and multi-culturalism that people hold, thinking that anything foreign must be dangerous or less good.

It is also important to note that for each of the lunar phases, you can easily become accustomed to associating each with a color. Color is a universal language, and each generates energy unto itself. In the time of the New Moon, the color silver relates well. You can use that symbol – the silver crescent – and draw it and fill it in with the color of silver, or you can use the actual metal silver. This symbol is useful when you are searching for new beginnings. The Full Moon’s color is snow white, the white symbolizing the purity and the wholeness of the Moon. The Dark Moon’s color is indigo. Indigo rules, in color psychology, other dimensions of time-space.

In the first situation the salesperson walked in and right from the introduction made an effort to get to know the prospect, the company and their intentions. Both men were confident but for two different reasons. In the first example the salesperson had little experience with large accounts and had to practice the situation in order to have confidence in his performance. The second salesperson had confidence because of similar experiences in the past but did little to practice the situation so his confidence came off as slightly arrogant.
From this record we can tell certain things about Lydia Lloyd – that she was repeatedly convicted on counts of larceny from 1867 – 1879, aged between twenty-five and thirty-six. Lydia Lloyd may not have even been her name – she had previously been convicted under the names Kate Howard, Emily Howard and Emily Cougdon. She had moved around the country. We can also tell that this offender worked as a ‘laundress’ in 1879, and sadly that no-one came to visit her during her ten year imprisonment. It seems that this offenders ‘mode of living’ for the majority of her life was what social investigators might term ‘irregular‘.

We wanted to overnight somewhere, but decided to press on. The open road and the changing scenery and the procession of small towns became part of the destination.

A journey therefore not solely aimed at getting to a specific place.

After the birth of her first baby in 1998, Thurman took a rest from major roles to concentrate on motherhood. After a five year hiatus, her role in Tarantino’s Kill Bill relaunched her career. Production was delayed for several months after Thurman became pregnant again, as Tarantino refused to recast the part. The film took nine months to shoot, and was filmed in five different countries. The film series earned Thurman Golden Globe nominations for both entries, and three MTV Movie Awards for Best Female Performance and twice for Best Fight

Now imagine that you are on a long journey and you are going to stay at a friend of a friend’s house. How would staying at their house be different to going home? For a start, you’d be very polite. You’d need to wait to be invited to have a shower, or get something to eat. You wouldn’t know where anything was or what it was OK to use. You’d have to work a bit harder at conversation as you found things in common to talk about.
Counterfeiting has grown up: from a cottage industry practised in backroom workshops, it has evolved into a worldwide plague, professionally perpetrated on an industrial scale. The peccadillo has become a global felony, prevalently executed through the involvement of organized crime syndicates attracted by high profits at low risk. Product piracy effectively threatens innovation and creativity—the pillars of our developed economy—and poses a threat to the health and safety of consumers. The FBI has called counterfeiting ‘the crime of the 21st century’.

#735 - The Naked Spur (1953) - (#695 on TSPDT) Anthony Mann made a series of revisionist westerns with Jimmy Stewart that combined to change the face of the western that would eventually lead into the days of Leone and Peckinpah. This film is the middle one of these five films and it is the one ranked the highest on the list (though still not that high). Perhaps Mann's films do not have the physical beauty of some by John Ford, but as far as creating a compelling, oft-times psychologically twisted, story, then, Anthony Mann is your, er...man.

Osama bin Laden’s first fatwas were originally published in London. And, as early as the late 1980s and early 1990s, a number of radical Islamist conferences took place in Britain. Islamists from all over the world attended these conferences. They included Hamas, Hezbollah and many other Islamist groups which loved violence. In other words, the Global Jihad more or less began in the late 1980s in our very own city of London.

‘The whale shark, Rhincodon typus, is a slow-moving filter feeding shark, the largest living fish species. The largest confirmed individual was 12.65 metres (41.50 ft) in length. The heaviest weighed more than 36 tonnes (79,000 lb), but unconfirmed claims report considerably larger whale sharks. This distinctively-marked fish is the only member of its genus Rhincodon and its family, Rhincodontidae (called Rhinodontes before 1984), which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. The shark is found in tropical and warm oceans, lives in the open sea with a lifespan of about 70 years. The species originated about 60 million years ago. Although whale sharks have very large mouths, they feed mainly, though not exclusively, on plankton, microscopic plants and animals, although the BBC program Planet Earth filmed a whale shark feeding on a school of small fish.

…It’s just that Brad is cynical enough about the supreme court and the political aspects of the decision that he thinks enough justices will be able to argue themselves into ignoring the constitution and doing what they want to do, rather than what is right.

All this thought about shoes has made me think about what our shoes say about us. My elegant aunt's selection told me I wanted to be just like her. My mother's were much more practical but lovely non the less until her later years when she was relegated to less attractive shoes in order to accommodate a brace insert. It broke her heart and ours as well.

LEGAL NOTICE FOR CABAL AGENTS OF THE CROWN
According to local legend, Pope Leo IX fled to Sessa Aurunca after the defeat of his army at Civitate in June 1053. He first concealed himself in a farmer's cottage near the eastern walls of the city, but his identity was soon discovered. Emerging from his hiding place, he was transferred with great ceremony to a monastery located in the area of the ducal palace. A nineteenth-century church now stands on the supposed site of the first part of his sojourn.
I love cycling. As a kid it would be our method of transport around the neighbourhood. We never thought of it as exercise. We were certainly not trying to “get fit” by riding our bikes.
Two of my favorite dishes from the dinner were the scallop crudo with grapefruit and lavender and the pork belly confit with seared foie gras and julienned apples over smoked potatoes. The scallop crudo was simply amazing. With sweet and citrus notes paired with the light fragrance of lavender, the dish was to die for. Yes, I want that as part of my last meals. This dish also inspired me to top grapefruit with St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur. The pork belly confit with foie gras and apples was also intense, rich, and well balanced. The potatoes were amazing. As an ordinary root veggie, the potato is usually a filler food, a side dish, something that we generally kick to the back of our minds. Not these potatoes though. With smokey goodness, Chef Jason's smoked potatoes can hold their own.

Many friends have asked me why it’s important to me to be out at my job. And I have to say that it’s not so much about being out as it is about not having to hide who you are. I spend many years of my, rather young, life in the closet and it felt stifling. There’s no air in there and once you’re out where there IS air, you don’t want to go back in, don’t want to have to watch every word you say to people. A partner may be a big part of your life; you don’t want to have to hide that person. It’ll put strain on the relationship, because what person really wants to feel like they’re a liability to their partner?

I know I’m meant to wrap up blog posts with some supposedly cute and witty call-back like “bikram is all I think about – well that and Point Break”. But, as simple as my point is, I don’t want to trivialise it like that. So I’m just going to stop. The blog post, not the yoga.
So, I will update again this weekend AFTER all the fun!
May we live in a world at peace surrounded by God's love.
It’s not that I don’t try to read them. I try. My problem is multi-faceted, though. First off, my personal policy is that whenever possible I borrow books from the library rather than buy them. In the same vein as public education and public parks, I’ve sort of already bought these books. Second of all, my interest in non-fiction does wane at times. Frequently, when I check out a book on parenting, the book is due back before I’ve read more than a chapter.
I had sent him the initial message online and we chatted a quite a bit right off the bat. We kept chatting on a fairly daily basis, trying to make plans to meet. We cancelled our first date, since he had just started an internship with America’s Test Kitchen and was crazy busy. He also was getting back into Mixed Martial Arts, which also ate a lot of his time. He was sort of a trainer at this gym in the area, so it kept him busy when work didn’t. I understood, but got pretty annoyed and backed off on trying to meet. Like I’ve said before, if you’re too busy to meet, you’re too busy to date. We chatted here and there, but nothing too serious and never met up.
The first ever draft was when Zeus told Hades (mythical asshole, am I right?), “Get off of my lightening bolt team (this was before pigskin existed) and get the HELL away from my beard.” Everyone was so upset by this — Aphrodite, Xena: Warrior Princess, Cher… These two made the perfect team, and seriously bro, what the fuck? As it turns out, Zeus found a younger, less-expensive player that would ultimately lead his team to greatness. (SPOILER ALERT: it was Jesus)
What else? That deep dish pizza eaten in a fancy Asian looking building tastes just as good as if I was sitting on my couch. The moon tonight is still exceptional. In honor of the moon, I’d like to share a poem with you.
"They include the Short-beaked Echidna, the Platypus, and the Leadbeater’s Possum, all mammals found only in Australia, and the Red Andreaea, a plant endemic to the Agulhas Negras Mountains of Brazil. Also represented are many birds familiar in the northeastern U.S. such as the Peregrine Falcon, Barred Owl, Connecticut Warbler, House Sparrow, and one of the world’s most widespread -- the Barn Owl. There also are illustrations of an African Dung Beetle, along with the producer of its nourishment -- an African elephant. Also included are recreations of extinct organisms such as the Apatosaurus (a dinosaur), Deinosuchus (an ancient crocodile), Odontochelys (the ancestor of turtles) and Titanoboa (shown above)."

it’s impossible to understand the extent of this Love. Time and time again we disappoint, still in our brokenness we are loved by the Creator. Amazing. Any other person would just give up.
Then there are those who are literally herding cats. Perhaps they have a house full of the critters. Perhaps they’ve taken an interest in a colony of feral cats, possibly even going to the trouble of participating in trap-neuter-release programs to reduce population growth and improve the health of cats in the colony. Perhaps they volunteer for a local animal shelter, fostering cats who need more special care than they can get in a shelter environment or providing kittens with a highly interactive environment to help them learn the socialization skills that will help them to get adopted.

The GGPs watched as police and dog escorted a bleeding, hand-cuffed man up from the stream road along the tractor path through their yard to the parking area of their house. There the EMTs secured him to a wheelchair, hoisted him into the ambulance, and whisked him off to a hospital for treatment. At this point the police departed, the ambulance departed, the fire-fighters went through some automotive gymnastics with flashlights to turn the truck around in our driveway, and then it also departed.
I should have been suspicious when the screen kept flashing Lisboa/Oporto – Philadelphia. I kept asking myself, why Porto. It was a direct, over ocean flight to Philadelphia. Boy was I ever wrong.

Leaving Stillwater I had 58 miles behind me but knew I likely had that many more miles to go. I was feeling fine and hoping that feeling wouldn't soon fade. I used our dinner-date at Outback for motivation. It worked.
Like Pollan’s approach, Stein arrived at her present opinion through a series of trial and error. She didn’t set fire to a woodchuck’s home, but she did take part in the wholesale spraying of trees which led to the destruction of more than just the pest she was trying to save the trees from. Now (well, seventeen years ago) she doesn’t preach that you completely let your lawn go wild - what appears will not always be what you want to see - but that you understand the stages at which things happen, plant judiciously and with a vision of what it will look like in seventeen years rather than seventeen days (or months, even) and know that once you’ve restored the habitat to the balance it knew before the developers had their way with it...well, then you can sit back and watch the party. (By the way, I found the chapter in which she used the “Lawn As Party, Gardener as Host/Hostess” metaphor particularly charming.)

Many dogs are classified as “working” or “sporting” dogs. These dogs were bred to do such things. In an effort to keep them happy and healthy, you must create a job or sport for them. Agility and obedience routines as well as dog day care, help to simulate jobs in today’s current setting.

My dad 's family was dirt poor. He was orphaned at an early age and grew up without a father.Though he was a product of a third marriage and had three siblings, he also had half brothers and sisters which really did not matter even then. Grandma tried all sorts of jobs, so she can feed her kids. Dad once told me that they would have cooked rice and salt for their meals. He and his is youngest brother Pinong, whom he was really fond of, would add some water on the cooked rice, so it would have some taste. These were days when they were lucky. Some days were not. And my grandama could not help but shed a tear, while they were gathered together at the dinner table. That was enough for my aunt Afric and my dad ,who was the second eldest in his brood, to leave Lubao, and try his luck at Fort Stotsenburg. And true enough he did.

Wash and tear your spinach, discarding the stems. Blanch the spinach in boiling water for 30 seconds, and then cool it down and squeeze out all the water using a paper towel. Beat the eggs in a bowl, then add the milk, half the parmesan cheese, and salt and pepper and mix together well. Place the spinach and crumbled feta cheese into the baking dish, then pour the egg mixture on top. Top with the remaining parmesan cheese and bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes to an hour. Check the centre with a toothpick to make sure it's not runny and then bring the quiche out of the oven and let it cool for 5 minutes before serving.

Running is hard, even though all I am doing now is short shuttle runs. I get out of breathe very fast. At PT this week we did boxing which suits me perfectly right now. Friday's bootcamp was a struggle. I found it much harder and am starting to speak out and say that I'm just doing things differently. And I'm ok with that. The social aspect of bootcamp is good for me. It keeps me focussed on my long term goals. And it makes me happy. I am just going to have to jog when they run, walk when I tire, and go low impact all the way!

He twiddled around with the recording levels and played back my test snippet. I was horrified by the hiss on the tape. It sounded like the pantomime audience jeering the baddy back at the theatre. Even though I only had an audience of one and he was concentrating hard with his own breath in abeyance. I protested my dread of the outcome. He purred that he could record with Dolby to minimise the hiss, but that its drawback was it compressed and flattened out all the recorded range too. I hadn't liked the sound of my voice on the test anyway. It wasn't how I thought I sounded. How I heard myself speak. He laughed and said that was because this was the purest version of my voice I would ever be likely to hear.

"States across the country are updating their liquor laws to reflect modern convenience and demand," said DISCUS Vice President David Wojnar, noting that West Virginia joins neighboring states Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia in allowing tasting events at restaurants, bars and now liquor stores.

Motherhood –a turning point in life. A few good friends have crossed over, a few are on the way, a few don’t want to, and a few are saying “not yet.” It’s become a political issue, a gay rights issue, a normal everyday issue, a choice, a responsibility, a right of passage, an accident, a mistake, a yearning, a desire, a fear, a risk, a journey and everything in between. It’s highly debated, and yet the details are mostly hidden behind a door where only women who have been there have the key. According to those who are there, it’s the one thing you can read a million books on and yet still have no idea how to deal with when it happens.

Walking through the sculpture, the eye travels the path above, the path ahead, and the path below. The curved walls nearly met, and never part: dynamic.

…most Australian workers, over 8m in total, now have a private nest-egg for their old age. No tax is paid when members withdraw from their fund; they can take all they want as a lump sum, subject to a limit, or buy an annuity. Aussies are now a nation of capitalists. At the same time the state pension system, and therefore the taxpayer, is being progressively relieved of most of the burden of retirement provision, since eligibility for the state pension depends on both assets and income. As supers take over, the provision for old folks’ incomes will be almost entirely based on defined contributions, not defined benefits. So Australia is in the happy position of not having to worry too much about the pension implications of an ageing population… The supers…have created a pool of capital in Australia that might not otherwise have existed. Collectively worth about $1.3 trillion—much the same as GDP—they have made Australia the world’s fourth-largest market for pension savings.

Many of these things are already against the law. We have laws against littering, idling, double-parking, and parking in bus stops. Do we really need a permit system to enforce them? Others are just vague and bizarre, like the city should create a pre-crime unit to arrest people before they commit violence. But the biggest complaint people seem to have, according to last year's press release, is that they're messy. Squadron's favorite phrase is that Chinatown is "like the wild west." It's "chaos," Chinatown is being "overrun" with "no clear rules." The proposal would "create a clearer system" that would allow the bus companies to operate "in harmony with the local community."
Last, I have committed to transforming my business. My goal is to be putting 10 hours a week to my business. Where as up till now, I have put in a few hours a week at my busiest. I have really just made it a side hobby, till now. A secondary supplement to my life as a mom. But I want more for my business and I want more out of it too. So I’m working to build some business building activities into my daily life. The key seems to be taking time during the evenings, when I would normally sit and watch TV to plan my business calls for the next day. Not easy when I finally feel like the kids aren’t demanding of me or calling on me for things when the house is finally quiet and it is my choice how to spend my minutes. But since those kiddos are my 5 biggest why’s for even wanting to have my own business, I think it is certain to be fulfilling & so rewarding when this business is helping to give us more time together and not only the chance to keep me home and here for them, but also helping to afford their college studies and the possibility of their Dad working from home too eventually.

Duryodhana, the main enemy of the Pāṇḍavas, sent the powerful sage Durvāsa with his thousands of disciples to dine with Yudhiṣṭhira while they were exiled in the forest. There was no way Yudhiṣṭhira could feed so many people, so Durvāsa would be inconvenienced. Durvāsa is famous for getting angry easily and cursing people seriously, so Duryodhana made this scheme in the hopes that Durvāsa would curse the Pāṇḍavas.

Dear Mr Rivett,
Just because you allowed life, disappointment, regrets, people, low self esteem, (fill in the blank), to kill your dreams, does not mean you need to discard them. The power is still there, you still carry that hope and dream around with you. It hasn’t lost its capacity to perform. You just need to connect to the right sources, fix the blocks you’ve erected and get powered up again.
As a child, I loved THE CAY by Theodore Taylor. I read it so many times that I lost count.

The weather has been unsettled all week, but we managed an overcast day with just a short spotting of rain after lunch. All your friends turned up but one, who had chickenpox. A tasty BBQ and a death-by-chocolate birthday cake that left the adults speechless with bliss. Lots of running around outside, then the late afternoon with a few of your girlfriends playing made-up games indoors. One by one, as everyone left, you said sweetly - thankyou for coming. As mama and tata exhaled contentedly....... you stayed up late, quietly playing with your toy tool-kit pressie.

Just getting off the bus is an event. While trying to avoid stepping on little toes, two sets hands quickly take your right hand and forearm, two more sets take your left hand and forearm. Another set of hands grabs you from behind and you are immediately relieved of any baggage you might have had. Meanwhile anyone who is left is hugging you from the front. You have to shuffle your feet because you can't move any faster and you don't want to step on anyone. I got led into the Team Hope Pavilion and seated on the boys side of the room, meanwhile Diane was led to the girls side of the room.

The children on either side of me were were gently caressing my arms and then the worship started.

Are you having a bad day? Then pop in your favorite CD or turn on your favorite playlist on your MP3 player and get it out of your system. Splurge on your favorite (non-alcoholic) drink on the way to work, even if it means you’ll be ten minutes late. Nobody deserves to put up with the verbal diarrhea coming out of your mouth, so make sure it’s been taken care of by the time you clock-in. Or if you can’t control your bad mood, do everybody a favor and take a sick day. It’s not that we don’t care about our co-workers, but bad moods are contagious!

Let’s assume for this next example that you are in a professional sales environment and you have spent the last few months trying to land an appointment with a huge prospect. You finally got an opportunity to get in and see the decision maker and this is your one chance to come in guns blazing and knock their socks off. What you do not know is that immediately following your appointment they are meeting with someone from your largest competitor. Someone who has been in the business a lot longer than you and is very good at what they do. I will outline both meetings and then we will break down their use of the principles and their effectiveness.
Given his attack against arch rival Anwar Ibrahim for supporting a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, such an appointment is hypocritical to say the least, especially since Najib even gave APCO staff access to key communications facilities in the country. It is well-know that many of the top staff at APCO are former high-level officers at Shin Bet and Mossad, the Israeli secret services. What an awful joke and when Anwar, DAP chairman Karpal Singh, PKR leaders Azmin Ali and Sivarasa Rasiah took issue on the matter, fearing breach of national security, Najib had them suspended and locked out of Parliament for 6 months!

While I may not type out Julia Child’s recipe word for word from page 313 of my copy (and run into potential copyrights infringement), the publishing group has provided a scanned copy. This dish may be difficult if you have never tasted much French cuisine (which is true in my case). The recipe is only meticulous because it appears to use the most careful and traditional methods of preparation. But hey, I have been collecting authentic recipes — authentic recipes are most likely traditional as well. Also, keep in mind that if we were to follow Julia Child’s recipe step-by-step, be prepared to free up at least 5 to 6 hours of cooking. Time seems to be a luxury these days, but cooking this dish ahead of time will only help the meat develop its flavour.

They record that on 3 February 1954 under the item 'Coloured Workers', Sir Winston stated ‘Problems which will arise if many coloured people settle here. Are we to saddle ourselves with colour problems in the UK? Attracted by Welfare State. Public opinion in UK won't tolerate it once it gets beyond certain limits.' Even he did not forsee the malicious propaganda that would be used to destroy the British people by their own elites!

Now that I'm working with Generation ministries at JCC, I spent a lot of time at the Christmas Eve services around the parent check-in area and working in several of the kids ministry rooms as a volunteer. One of my learnings was just how many people truly come to our church once every 4-6 months and still consider this "their church". I know this because when checking kids in, there were quite a few people who had no idea how our "new" check in system worked. The system is 4 months old!
My Dora the Explorer cakes usually just include Dora, Boots and Swiper as the cake toppers. But Priela’s mom wanted me to include Iza on the cake. So not only did I add Iza, I also added the Fiesta Trio in between the candles. I also added Map and Backpack.
The Hawks were investigating, among others, the Ratanang Family Trust, named after his son, which Malema allegedly used as a conduit for bribes, a company owned by Maropeng Ramohlale, the mother of his son, and others that are run by Malema’s friends.
I made this bookmark with my Irish Luck set. I thought it would be cute to send to my friend. I just love those free Stamp' Em's that come with the purchase of the set. That is what I matted the stamp on (the ivory piece)....love how it is specifically made for the stamp.

Once you pay your $180 New Zealand dollars, the process is very quick and easy. After you sign a waiver, your weight is taken and written on the back of your hand. You then walk to the middle of the bridge where the bungee master awaits. As you sit near the platform watching participants willingly jump one by one, you are then harnessed, and your ankles are bound with a heavy cloth wrapped around them. Once the proper bungee chord is attached to you according to your weight, you then waddle to the edge of the plank, penguin-style, go to that happy place in your mind, look into the horizon and convince yourself to jump. And voila, it’s over. At least it seemed that easy…

Reports of slow loris bites are rare in literature. However, based on these published reports, it seems that slow loris bites are not venomous (Kalimullah et al., 2008; Wilde, 1972). Due to the high degree of similarity between the brachial gland exudate of slow lorises and the Fel d 1 allergen in domestic cats, the anaphylactic shock expressed by victims is probably just a reaction to the exudate's allergen.

What I wanted to do was put the focus on her since she was embarrassing me in front of other customers about something that's none of her business. Since she has no problem butting into my life, I wanted to talk about how her husband is a scumbag and filed divorce papers on her out of nowhere while she was out of town visiting her dying mother. And then he decided to change his mind and take her back. Why can't we talk about that instead of why I'm not having any children?

The level of description and writing here is nothing short of incredible. Kagawa brings this world to life with her excellent world building. The characters, settings and creatures (look out for the Rabids, who are the best monsters I have ever read in dystopian fiction) are all realistic and there was not one point where I felt the she had pushed it a little too far.

His post-War contribution to the Art world, as connoisseur, collector, gallery owner, funder of other galleries and supporter of artists, particular those working in neglected or unfashionable genres, has been sadly undervalued. The list of artists who exhibited at his gallery in the 1950s is both impressive and wonderfully eclectic.His bequest to Southampton City Art Gallery gives you some idea of his taste and individuality and is well worth checking out.

Thus, we act as if we are prepared to risk American lives to defend self-indulgent oligarchs who should be defending themselves—and who regard us as little better than godless and corrupt mercenaries. On the other hand, we are likely to abandon to the savagery of Saddam Hussein the restless Kurds whose uprisings we deliberately promoted in 1990-1991. Kurdistan, it still seem to me, would be a useful as well as a humane addition to the map of West Asia. In these, as in domestic matters, much is to be said for making the right promises and then keeping them, beginning with the promises that a Constitution represents.
Greg: I was excited for Blake’s selection of The Garage Café. I have been many a times with the bros in the evening hours to hang out on the patio area and enjoy the weather. I had always seen the lunch menu and small kitchen area, thinking that it would be good place to try for lunch. We settled in to our small table, due to the restaurant being pretty full at lunch time. TV’s were on showing college basketball. The menu was unique in that it didn’t have any prices on it. It had some basic sandwiches and a soup of the day option. Being a cash only establishment, I came in with a set amount of money on me to spend ($10). The no prices made it an adventure. I settled on a turkey and ham sandwich on wheat bread. This came with some wavy Lays chips. I topped it off with a water. I figured this would keep me under budget. We waited about 10 or so minutes for our sandwiches. When they arrived, I was happy with the large size of the sandwich and amount of chips. The sandwich was stuck firmly in between “not bad” and “not great”. There wasn’t anything wrong with it, it was just a normal sandwich. I ended up closing out at under $8, which was exciting. If you are in the area, give it a try and judge for yourself. Overall Rating: 2.5 out of 5 Bros
Tuesday night I rocked it like a champ.
When we got back from dinner, The Pilot and I exchanged gifts. He got me some fantastic Lululemon winter running gear and I got him the new Kindle Fire. I was so excited to see how surprised he was with his gift. It totally made my Christmas. After exchanging gifts, we passed out and woke up at 4:30 the next morning so that he could continue his trip and I could make the trek back to Newark. I spent the day with my mom lounging around watching movies and then he came over and set up his new Kindle Fire. Mom and I watched "It's a Wonderful Life" which I can now cross off The Movie List and I absolutely loved it.

I’m glad I had Grams’ extra set of hands at Church! Isabel and Ryan were pretty wired from everything going on. I always come out of Church feeling like I’ve run a marathon or been in a wrestling match, but they seemed especially loud and wiggly, even for them. Isabel was especially thrilled about being in Church too….

I am hoping, and if I was a praying type person, I would totally be praying that I do not have to actually go in to renew my license. The last time was a nightmare. Not because they were slow. No, I made an appointment and only waited a few minutes to start the bureaucratic drivel. As I am waiting in line to take the eye test, I am thinking to myself, "Piece of cake, self. Those charts are like neon sign big. I should probably memorize them but, shoot, I can read them just fine, no need to cheat."
Actually I was, at one time, married to a woman who is dyed in the wool Native (north)American, 1/2 Ottawa to be exact. She was "Playboy" magazine good looking but a horrible pain in the ass. Anyway I learned a few things along the way. Everybody has heard that the old cliche that "Indians" tend to have problems with alcohol. After observing her (and her father) I can attest that there may be something to that. Neither of them could tolerate even a moderate amount of firewater without making that leap into raging drunken psychosis. Her father has since passed on. I miss him sometimes. My ex wife however..........

But the people who love beer made it happen and I'm assuming we still want it done right. If we have to shame craft brewers into this, if we have to make fun of them, if we have to appeal to their sense of tradition and call them out when they ignore it -- that's how this is supposed to work! The brewers, the passionate ones, are supposed to be running this, not the marketers and sellers of the stuff, and it's supposed to be run for us, the people who love the beer, the people who know when the hell summer and fall begin.
So why did I watch this movie so persistently to the end? I wanted to see the incredible montage showing the earthquake’s destruction of the city. After watching the movie, I looked at pictures on Wikipedia and the movie appears to have accurately shown the extent of the damage not only from the earthquake, but from the subsequent fires and dynamite explosions (the dynamite was supposed to have stopped the fires, but it didn’t work).
If you desire to get rakeback in the poker room but you might have an current account there you can start off a brand new account making use of other payment particulars (your brother’s or somebody’s). But this just isn’t legal and when the room finds out it’ll block both accounts with all the cash. Poker rooms allow to possess only 1 actual funds account for each person. That’s why to obtain rakeback may be fairly hard at times.Poker Stars, a leader in poker enterprise, features a quite great VIP plan. They say that a player can get benefits equal to 60% rakeback at the greatest amount of their VIP program. It really is a good offer. But it is challenging to reach greatest VIP stage at Poker Stars.All leading rakeback companies also supply special promotions for his or her buyers. Rake races are among the most widespread promotions in poker. You’ll be able to enhance your immediate rakeback up to 70% if you win a rake race! Rake Chases will also be common among players.

That chill though. It can be so powerful. Even one successful call has put my mind to ease. Just the musings, or remembrances, of a long lived, fully experienced, man I suppose. Ah, all good. It would not be good to live in a world without fearing the loss of loved ones. That would mean one has no love, wouldn't it? What could death hold that no love here would cause one to fear?
Yesterday I told the story of how I neglected to share the gospel with our service agent at the car dealership where our van was being repaired. After bringing the van back four times and speaking with this gentleman on each occasion, he thanked me for not getting in his face about their failure to fix the problem and I blew the opportunity to proclaim Christ.

So, how much do I love the CDC this week:
The important quality for the President of the United States to have is the judgement and decision-making skills to determine who he should take the time to call and when he should decide to just sit it out and not get involved. It is important that the President have the sound judgement to focus on the important issues facing our nation and use his office and the power that goes with it to improve situations and smooth past difficult issues. It is important that the President be able to decide when to use his office to bring light to issues and focus public attention on them with a phone call.

Control? Obama has given up a great deal of control in order, he hopes, to get the reform that will keep our nation from going bankrupt (more than 60% of personal bankruptcies in the U.S. are due to excessive health costs). This is the mark of a leader. Did you read Goodwin’s book on Lincoln? You should. Obama did. It shows how a true, flag-waving patriot leads this nation.
Now, I should begin by telling you I am not a scrapbooker. I know...it is shocking! I am probably the craftiest person you will meet, but I do not scrapbook. I have tried the traditional method. I just find it too time consuming and a bit overwhelming. I could spend all night on one layout. In the end I just have a bunch of supplies, a lot of half finished albums, and boxes of disorganized photos. I really wish I could commit to scrapbooking. I am always in awe of the beautiful albums and ideas I see on other blogs.

Something Like Normal by Trish Doller: This one comes out in June, but seriously, do not miss it. Just preorder it now. I read it straight through, then reread it the next day, and read my favorite parts the day after. I couldn't pick up another book for about a week or more after, this book got to me that much. It is absolutely, undeniably extraordinary. This book shattered me, put me back together, then broke me just a little more. Travis is, in a lot of ways, a jerk... but he's also intensely loyal and caring and straightforward. He is a mess in his own right, and wanting to get past that. Watching the changes he goes through in this book are aching and so realistic, and then add in the romance and the way it develops, with this slow yet gripping burn... and this book is just breathtaking.

Since they continued staring at me in puzzlement, I asked them to think about times they’ve been sent to their rooms with instructions to sit quietly on their beds until they can explain why they were sent thither and show some remorse for whatever caused the sending, then asked them what I usually do when they emerge. Both quickly replied that I greet them with hugs and kisses, just as the young man’s father did. “That’s absolutely right,” I told my daughters, “and, while I’m always happy to see your adorable little faces, I’m even happier that you’ve decided you want to do good things instead of unkind ones.”

I know many, many, women who are doing more than recovering from addiction, and healing from childhood trauma. They are working hard to build their disintegration experiences into a firm foundation of personal integrity and authenticity. These women, and I am one of them, have moved beyond excuses and blame and self abuse. They live in honesty of all that they were, what they experienced, how it affected them, and those around them. We have a gleaming personal integrity. We make mistakes, and take responsibility, we apologize, we keep moving forward. It’s a beautiful way to live, and a gorgeous thing to watch.
The Zombie: The modern archetype of the Zombie is rooted deep in the genre. Zombies are undead; that’s fairly simple to ascertain. They are plagued with a voracious hunger, they never stop to rest, and they move whether it’s night or day. They have no preference in whom they will kill and they can add to their ranks with a single, infected bite. The Zombie exists with no subtlety, no brains, and absolutely no subterfuge. That makes them pretty formidable, but how will they stack up against the Vampire or the Werewolf?
And where is the elite Mainstream Media in its coverage of this festering scandal of such epic proportions? Over the past year they have dedicated scant minutes to the scandal, and then, usually to parrot the Obama administration's lies and obfuscations. Just during one recent week, the elite media spent countless hours covering the death and funeral of a beloved celebrity drug addict, compared to the few minutes they have spent covering Operation Fast And Furious during all of the last year.

Ann is going to break up with Tom because he makes her watch stupid movies and has 20” rims on his VW Golf. April gets drunk and tells them they’re arguing about stupid stuff. Tom and Ann agree and get back together. Honestly, I don’t like these two together. They’re just so ill-suited. I hope this storyline ends quickly.

I think there are a great number of differences between True Blood Eric and book Eric, but I think both would rack up quite a few points on this test. Then again, vampires in general, at least any that would survive for any length of time, would seem predisposed to psychopathic tendencies. What’s your opinion? Is Eric a psychopath? And if he is, are all fangirls akin to women writing love letters to serial killers?

And another other reason is that it's just downright dangerous going to my mailbox! It's way out on the main road and directly across from a much-used intersection. If a car is turning left from the main road into the road opposite my driveway, other cars will travel around it, passing on the right and this is exactly where our mailbox sits. It's been hit once, too, since we moved here last October. Smashed to the ground back in November. So I'm really careful about picking up the mail and keeping my eyes on the traffic.

Well, no one has ever accused the reigning communist government of South Africa, the ANC, of having a brain cell to share amongst all 2000 MPs (or whatever the latest number of parliament members the country is at now). In their infinite wisdom, they are now challenging the restriction on singing the song. So, let's think about this for a moment. Besides the obvious that they're not very bright - just why would they want to appeal the banning of a highly racist and violence-inducing song in a country where over 18 000 people are murdered every year (that's the figure that the ANC admit to - we know it's higher and more like 30 000 murders a year). Makes you think. Could it be that they want to keep racial tension simmering forever so that their dumbed down black population don't look to the ANCs obvious governmental failings? Could it be that this is the next step to ensure whites are forced off their land out of sheer terror of what's to come? Whatever the reason, this is what South Africa and the great ANC has been reduced to - keeping the masses of people living in poverty, relying on the government for their hand-outs, whilst all the while the ANC live like kings off the sweat of the tax payer and the country's riches. Viva South Africa.
One of the greatest challenges all Schutzhund photographers face is how to reduce glare and reflection on the Schutzhund field, especially when the sun is shining brightly. The problem is on sunny days Schutzhund fields act like one big reflective surface. Landscape photographers (or as I refer to them masters of outdoor light) will tell you that ideally, outdoor photography should be done either early in the morning or late in the day, when the sun’s rays are more horizontal than vertical. Don’t we all wish Schutzhund operated on a photographer friendly schedule, she says reflectively (sorry, couldn’t resist the pun). But since, tracking is usually the only thing going on early in the morning (not the most exciting Schutzhund activity to photograph), and training and trials are usually done by late afternoon, these ideal conditions are not usually available when we are trying to get our best shots.
Shadows in Flight is the newest entry in the Ender universe. Ender's old friend Bean nears an untimely death from the runaway growth that is a side effect of the genetic manipulation that made him so brilliant. He has traveled on a near-lightspeed spaceship with his three children who share his condition, in hopes that a cure would be found on Earth in their absence, but to no avail. The first 50 pages focused on the terrible stress on their family from the disappointment and isolation. The next 50 pages turn outward, as they spot a huge spacecraft which they believe to be a slow Formic ship, a bugger hive sent into deep space before the war between Formics and humans. They stop to investigate.

Well, equally intriguing is the story of two of Haque’s hotel bosses allegedly on video “high-fiving each other and doing what looks like an extraordinary dance of celebration lasting some three minutes”. I’ve yet to establish the tape’s existence or the identity of the ‘bosses’, but two senior managers celebrating a guest’s demise while being in constant touch with French politicians/spooks would look very odd indeed….if proven.
By chance my iPod (Nano, set w/75 songs, set to “Shuffle”) switched as we came up on the turn. LeeAnn Womack and “I Hope You Dance” came on.

We lost some people, but I was *amazed* at how many continued on. I kept forgetting about the Relay folks, there were some of them and they made me mad at time because at each exchange point people would RUN fast (because they had been waiting HOURS and were FRESH and were running a 10K maybe). I wanted to yell “I’m 46 years old and running the whole damn thing!”. Tee hee.

Shouldn't a hero be someone who inspires greatness in you? I think it's a tough question and every time I ask it I wonder who I would say.

that on Facebook PDQ when I saw it. I bet from the title you can tell what he was writing about. When I posted it, everyone loved it. It struck a nerve (the laughing one) with many of my friends. How could you not want to read this book? Now if it was called “How a Christian Lost Weight” or “Christians are Fat Too” would it have intrigued people to read the book? Probably not. I notice that the title of a blog post can increase my readership for the day. The more funny or intriguing a post is the more readers I have. With so many of us having 100s of blogs in our Reader, we need to quickly decide what to read, just like a book. If the title doesn't grab me, then I'm not going to pick it up or click on it. Sorry, it's true. I bet you have never thought of it that way. Why do you pick up books? Because either the title intrigues you or the artwork does. Same with a blog. I've written some great posts, only to see that no one has read it. Unfortunately, we are in “buyers market” in the bloggy world. If we can't “sell” our posts to our readers, they won't get read. Good thing that I'm in a year of contentment and just being able to post is good enough for me.
Next week is my birthday.

I was able to find a suitable printable and adapted some others to suit my needs!
I got written up for three things, two of which my boss and I agreed weren't really relevant. The third was not only totally justified, but pulled me up short. I've gotten careless about making sure orders get written, so it looks like I've been haring off on my own, making treatment decisions. This is obviously bad. Nurse Jo is going to spend more time checking orders prior to punching out, and probably doing a lot more last-minute running around to fix things as a consequence.
Some of our expectations are focused only on ourselves, such as expectations of what our lives should be like, or how we should be behaving or performing. For example, it's easy for me to think back to all of the expectations I once had about how a family is supposed to operate. In my head, I had mapped out exactly what it takes to raise a child, be a husband, have a productive household, and be an accepted member of society. For me, it was pretty simple, really. Dad works, mom works; breakfast as a family with a healthy meal; lunches and book bags all packed the night before; kids on the bus and doing well at school; work being hard but rewarding; home by 6:00, kids all there, dinner together then chores; some time to play, then homework; then time to brush your teeth and put on your PJs, and off to bed by 9:30 or so. Of course, the kids would play sports, and I'd be a member of the Jaycees, mom would be on the Chamber of Commerce.
Not so sure about that one. "Less tolerant of BS" is perhaps a better description.
It doesn't take a lot of imagination to realize that a baby in dirty diapers gets sick more. Goes to the emergency room more. Means more stress and hardship for a child and a mother living under already incredibly stressful circumstances. Many parents can't afford diapers and food, so they get food. They try to wash out disposable diapers and reuse them. (BTW, laundromats have various rules about washing cloth diapers, and many do not allow it, in case you were wondering. And having enough cloth diapers on hand is obviously another expense most families can't afford either.) So if you're low income or homeless, odds are you don't have a washer and dryer for cloth diapers.

I remember when I was younger taking martial arts classes and being told that you never focus on hitting the target, you always focus past the target and going through it and not just hitting it. I think even the idea of “to be successful surround yourself with successful people” makes sense in part because you can find comfort in a higher level of success because of the level set by your peers. One book I read talked about the idea that we all have stories that we create. If the story we tell is that we always end up with bad luck and can’t reach the goals we set, then those around us will believe that IS our story. Our peers will think of us as the person whose luck is always bad and can never do what they set out to. The energy affects you and those who come to know you. We need to change our story, re-write it the way we want it and those around us will come to expect the new version we create.
The new argument being used by the Contra Costa Taxpayers Association is to claim Firefighters dominate the $100k pension club. But in taking a closer look at their pension club, none of the names on that list show up from our East Contra Costa County Fire Protection list.
—The Tricksters by Margaret Mahy—17-year-old Harry (Ariadne) deals with the arrival of three young men who seem ordinary to others, but ominous and supernatural to her. Are they ghosts? Fictional characters? Or just catalysts? A mature coming-of-age tale with supernatural elements by a very talented writer.

It was a good life, here in the protected canyon with its stream and its cottonwood trees. There was trade and there were crops of corn. The women wove the magic into the fabric of their clothing and baskets, and the men kept the farms and hunted on the mesas.
Before you think I have decided I am the Oh-Great-Enlightened-One, let me tell you, I have some pretty big strongholds that I just can't seem to allow God to break down. I have decided that this is the year to do it. And of course, any time the seasons change (such as springs arrival, along with Easter and warmer weather) I am inspired to "clean house". This time I am just going to clean house in ME.

Ugh. It's picture day again. At our school they want to inflict torture on the parents as often as possible. One of the many ways they accomplish this is to insist on TWO picture days during the school year. The fall picture day is first and then there are retakes a month after that. (For all the kids who had ketchup on their shirts or who forgot to keep their eyes open.) Then they lure us into a sense of security by having us wait for seven months before they decide to spring picture day on us again. Why? Who knows? They say it's so that they can do class pictures but how many of us really remember who that snarky little boy was who sat across the room with the goofy grin and crazy hair? Not me. Frankly, I don't really care either.

Up first are the florals. I simply couldn't resist indulging in this hot trend. I just love the bursts of color and beautiful patterns in these floral options. I also love that, because the dress is such a show-stopper, you can keep it simple with the accessories.
i knew from the start that this shawl was a bit on the frilly side for me. despite my better judgement, cassandra lured me in with its circular shape and its fluid feel. having learned the lesson (with my last shawl) that solid colours reveal a crocheted design so much better than variegated colours do, and hoping that it would counteract the frilly nature of this pattern, i went with basic black malabrigo sock (side note: malabrigo is definitely on my list of desert island yarns). i think it does work well here, letting the details of the pattern take the spotlight, as they should. and the details, well they were lovely and easily worked, except for that nasty row 38, which was not so much complicated as it was painstakingly slow (i really can’t emphasize that enough).
Well if I had read it my first thought would have been California Pizza Kitchen. But no - It's Cabbage Patch Kids! My mom is clearing some things out and came across my Cabbage Patch Kids. Yes, I was a child in the 80s during that peak time when parents where spending $200 a pop for a cabbage patch kid for Christmas. I don't know for sure but I'm guessing that might have been the first time parents really started acting a little psycho over getting THE TOY for their kids for Christmas. But don't you know I had to have one. I really didn't like baby dolls, but I really liked playing Barbies and I LOVED my Cabbage Patch Kids! They were real, too. They went everywhere with me and had new clothes every day and were put down to bed at night. They even wrote love notes to our hot lifeguard babysitter that my mom found. Hilarious!! My mom was a bit horrified. (We were about 10 yrs old so we knew enough to be a little juicy - I'm sure our babysitter was completely impressed with our disguised flirtations.)

Since its New York Fashion Week and Fashion's Night Out (FNO to some of you in the know) is September 8th, I thought it would be fitting to look at a few retail/celeb marriages:
Worldliness in the Western world produced the pagan Renaissance, and the departures in the Roman Church from the true Christian practices of the earlier Church (most notably the Roman Catholic idea of “indulgences” and especially the selling of them) produced the Protestant Reformation, which gradually threw out almost all of the ancient Christian traditions together with the various superstitions and false practices against which it was supposedly rebelling. This, in turn, produced the reaction which we know as the Age of Enlightenment, the eighteenth century, which threw out religion altogether and tried to base life upon human reason and common sense. This is basically what civilization is trying to live on today. And this is what has produced the Communism out of which Solzhenitsyn came, and against which he is protesting. Communism is the last and most consistent form of trying to make life on earth solely fit human ideas, not divine ones.

My first husband had reason to stay in touch. I had to change the locks so he’d stop ‘dropping in‘ on me and the kids. I had to get my friends to move some of the valuables we’d agreed were to be his to his house or he wouldn’t have taken them. I had to say “It’s been a year, the ‘stuff’ that’s mine and the ‘stuff’ that’s yours is no longer negotiable.” When the kids need something he’ll buy it. When there is a childcare issue or a transportation need he’ll step in. Rarely do I get push back on any request and my decisions are my own.

The origin of the wording of the Confiteor can be traced to rites used originally in the sacrament of penance. Early penitentials (books of penances) give formulas that resemble the modern Confiteor. The Pentiential of Egbert (d. 766) Archbishop of York has the starting point of a Confiteor “Through my fault I have exceedingly in thought, speech and deed, sinned... I confess before God, almighty Creator of heaven and earth, before the altar of the saint, and the holy relics that are in this holy place, and before you, priest, that I have sinned exceedingly………”

Her feet feel like stone
DARKEST MERCY picks up where RADIANT SHADOWS left off. Aislinn is fending for herself as Summer Queen because Keenan is AWOL. While she needs Keenan to run the court, she pines for her true love, Seth. But does Seth still want her? Seth, sworn brother of the Dark King and heir to the High Queen, is dealing with his new powers as a seer and exactly what that means. Donia — like Aislinn — is dealing the best she can with the Winter Court as she longs for Keenan — a love she thinks can never really be. And will Niall find a way to save Irial, who was stabbed with a poisonous knife by Bananach?
It's was a case of horrified fascination for me to read the story of her enslavement to this futile obsession and a reminder to any man with a speck of decency to never tell any girl that she might do well to lose some weight.

TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE: GREENHOUSE VISIT
The young man at the register told us we couldn't seat us there, and we said, no problem, our guys are arranging it over in the corner. He called someone on his cell phone while we were anxious to order some munchies to go with the drinks. The line behind us got longer and longer, but he was unflappable. Finally all was paid for, and instead of letting us go to our corner table, a waitress appeared and, opening a velvet rope, ushered us upstairs to the VIP Salon! We sat on purple and cerise velvet chairs and had our wines served in appropriate crystal far away from the bustling and noisy crowd downstairs. It was like a serendipitous miracle. And so much fun. If this is the author's life, then it's for me! But now I've got to get back to work on my prequel.
Carrie's husband Jack? You saw the grave? We had a card party and raised nearly $6,000 dollars, paid for all that black marble and the photos. Expensive. But it helped the widow. Only thirty five and three children to raise. But all the money went on the grave.

It kept fermenting all the way down to 1004 giving a final alcohol content of nearly 11%!!! I bottled it and thought it would be fine after 3 or 4 weeks 'aging' in the bottles. It wasn't fine. When I opened the first bottle I poured it out into a glass, I didn't even have to sniff the glass I could smell it from a distance. It smelt vile. The taste was out of this world in terms of disgusting things I had consumed! I gave some to SWMBO and I thought she was going to start crying the taste was that bad!
I don't buy a piece unless it "speaks" to me. The Beaumont Inn was my first house, an obvious choice. It was joined by Newport School (LBeau's hometown), Camden General Store (my hometown), Walker's Department Store (my maiden name and my grandson's name) and Claire's Card Shop (my daughter-in-law).

As a society, we have rightly adopted a harm reduction culture in which we seek to persuade people by law and reason to safeguard their health. Changes in the law have brought about restrictions on smoking and the forthcoming crackdown on alcohol will similarly save many lives. Healthy eating promotion is also playing its part (although the legal route may yet be needed in this respect). And police will stop and prosecute any motorist not wearing a seatbelt or motorcyclist without helmet.

And the expressions on their son's face when they love on him are priceless...it is evident he knows he is loved.

The Sutherland Shire is one of Sydney’s better known areas for a variety of historical, geographical and social reasons. It extends from Illawong to Kurnell to Waterfall to Lucas Heights and covers an area of 335 square kilometres with a population of approximately 220,000. The Sutherland Shire area was originally inhabited by the Dharawal people but became known as the Sutherland Shire in 1770, named after a Scottish seaman, Forbes Sutherland.

As energy per capita soared to its peak in the industrial world of the late twentieth century, hyperspecialization was the order of the day; as energy per capita declines—and it’s been declining for some time now—the range of specializations that can be supported by the economy will also decline, and individuals and families will have to take up the slack, taking over tasks that for some decades now have been done by professionals. During the transitional period, at least, this will doubtless generate a great deal of commotion, as professional specialists whose jobs are going away try to defend their jobs by making life as difficult as possible for those people who, trying to get by in difficult times, choose the do-it-yourself route. That process is already well under way in a variety of professions, and we’ll be discussing a particularly visible example of it in next week’s post, but this week I want to use this lens to examine the future of one of the industrial world’s distinctive creations, the grab bag of investigative methods, ideas about the universe, and social institutions we call “science.”

She recently made a figure of a southeast African Zulu warrior carrying a spear and shield and wearing white and blue garments. She also sculpts clay masks and pendants.
The chicken dishes, to my mind worked much better with the lighter, fresher and fruitier wines. This was also broadly true of the Murgh Malai Tikka and Lamb Sheek Kebab, the softer wines gave a nice clean, fruity background that tasted good with those dishes, while the more complex wines jarred somewhat.

He has been driving since he was 12, where driver education consisted of driving a drunk parent home from the pub. 20+ years of driving experience and an advanced driving course along the way. A piece of cake. After successfully passing the first stage, the Learners Permit, he was ready to drive with supervision. He had the option of going for his license straight away, but decided driving as a learner was the best course of action, after all, he was a little rusty after not being behind a wheel for so long.

The mixed conditions, running intermediates to start and then switching to the medium compound slicks, also gives us a good base line for Romain over the next two days.

Speaking of exciting athletes, did anyone else notice Oregon’s Ashton Eaton this weekend? In the hoopla over the sprinters the past few seasons many have forgotten that once upon a time the title of World’s Greatest Athlete used to be bestowed upon champion decathletes. Rafer Johnson, Bill Toomey, Bruce Jenner, Dailey Thompson, and Dan Obrien all evoked images of Superman. Well it’s still early in his young career, but Eaton could certainly put an “S” on his chest and I would support it. All he did at the Pac-!0 Championships – aside from winning the decathlon the week before – was run a heat of the 100 in 10.19 (+2.7) before taking second in the final in 10.33 (-1.1); win the 110 hurdles in 13.54 (-1..5); and win the long jump at 25’ 7.5”! Great performances all the way around.

Recipes are always reminding you to discard bay leaves, but since I’ve never had one kicking around to add to things it’s never been an issue. And then suddenly it is. Because one of those deadly things snuck into my soup and I forgot all about it. Are they supposed to remain intact in a crock pot for hours and hours on high? If they disintigrate, am I supposed to be responsible for picking out all the pieces? If they’re ingested, will they kill me? I really did not want to die in my sleep, but I couldn’t sleep anyway for fretting about it, so I got up to google “why must you remove the bay leaf?” It was extremely comforting to see that I was not the first idiot to ask that question.

Our members are an interesting and diverse group of people from all walks of life and professional backgrounds. They have found the reading and writing of haiku to be such a welcome break in their daily routines. It is such a calming influence in our lives. We capture the moment in haiku. Haiku doesn’t have to be written about nature or the seasons. It can be written about many things. Reading and writing haiku is therapeutic. We find true peace in our lives when we discover haiku.
Today I am going to review a group of CiM glass colors in the red spectrum - and we'll also hear from guest blogger Kim Affleck! I asked Kim to help me test one of the reds that I got, because she is really great at striking transparent red, and she agreed. She has lots to say about this new batch of reds that came in recently.

He told me his girlfriend now has 21 ducks and a Buddha statue in her back garden. To celebrate, we went down to see the ducks in St James’s Park which is a fine example of ornithological multi-culturalism where any number of imaginable and unimaginable breeds intermingle, mostly politely, and occasional light grey pigeons wander randomly about, looking slightly stunned at the surrounding plumage, like drab, grey-suited City gents who have accidentally wandered into the VIP hospitality tent behind the Pyramid Stage in Glastonbury.

How many lives would be saved if everyone obeyed the nationwide ban on speeding (i.e. “speed limits” posted in your hometown and on the interstate)? Similarly, how about if speed limits were enforced as strictly as the IRS audits tax returns? Do you think road deaths would go down measurably?

And much too often there were choirs formed for the hiking tourists, yodeling directly into my really angry ears. Folkloric sound for the average Japanese tourist in the mountains, screaming back to me full time, magnificently tripled by the eternal rocks’ echoes.
This is my absolute perfect sewing table. It's the right height, it's got a porcelain top so it's good for cutting and folding, and it's a vintage laundry table! AND IT IS BLUE! I can't believe it's only $120, and I swear if I had a place for this I would own it now. It's amazing.
There was a moment we both wondered if this would ruin our night. It had already been such a fantastic day -- we'd arrived in Paris just before noon and had time to stroll around this brand new city before settling into a hotel that was even better than we'd imagined. We'd spent the afternoon wandering -- every street a wonder of beauty and history that was overwhelming in scope.

I fully believe that when we do not know how to communicate with God, He finds ways to communicate with us. He lets us know that He has not forsaken us or left us alone. On the way home Jamie had turned the radio on for some background noise. I honestly didn't realize that it was even on until better than halfway home. Chris Tomlin's song I Will Rise came on and caught my attention. It was the first time I had heard that particular song and I do not think it was coincidence.
The rest of the stanza is AWOL, as if the singer has indeed plum lost his or her mind. Who can argue with that sentiment?

Supposedly recorded after a long, protracted nomadic existence spent bouncing from city to city and couch to couch culminating in a Greyhound bus retreat to a home base of San Francisco, A definitely feels like the work of a restless soul in search of anything that could possibly become familiar someday. “Gee, It’s Good to Be Back Home” is alternately sentimental and sarcastic about his travails as he sweetly sings of how it’s wonderful to be around old friends, but offers up the half-hearted description of his home as a place where you “don’t sleep, don’t eat and don’t drink the foam” as a sad acceptance of the futility of this dark place and the excess it entails.

Just so you know, a kids guitar is not necessarily the same thing as a small guitar. There are several different kinds of guitars that have small necks or bodies. Such instruments are used by professionals on stage and in the studio. However, these guitars are chosen purposefully for their sound or for other reasons, such as fitting better with a certain picking style.

I enjoyed every raid. Really. Okay, I didn’t love Throne of the Four Winds, but I adored Blackwing Descent. It was everything I wanted the first raid to be. The fights were fun (okay, maybe being a moonkin on Atramedes when Lunar Shower still rocked made it a little more fun, but still) and everything felt fresh again. I needed fresh after months and months of Icecrown.

It was a way to achieve a certain kind of self-expression, so it was never really wasted, I guess.

Keleche Osemele is a massive player standing a stout 6-5 350 lbs. making him a homogeneously large object to get around. The first thing you notice about Osemele is his incredibly quick hands as he shows the natural ability to strike and deliver a violent punch move that stuns and knocks his opponent off-balance. Osemele’s hand to hand combat skills are very good as he is able to re-position his hands and get good hand placement on his opponent. The issue that will keep Osemele from sticking outside in the NFL is his lack of mobility and overall athleticism. His lateral agility and ability to plant and pivot is lacking and his feet seem a little heavy as if they’re stuck in the sand sometimes. This inability to re-direct, leaves him susceptible to getting beat inside as his movement skills are below average. I also noticed that Osemele doesn’t show the best awareness or look necessarily that comfortable on the outside where he made some mental mistakes in this game. On one occasion Osemele abandoned his zone and chased a defensive lineman that was stunting to the inside. By leaving his zone he completely left his area unoccupied and open to a blitz, where his quarterback had to scramble for his life to escape the rush. On another play later in the game the defense was showing an over-load blitz to Osemele’s side when he failed to pick up any of the three players that were attacking his zone. These two examples make me believe Osemele might be lacking in overall awareness and blitz pick-up where he seems to get overwhelmed or play undisciplined in some instances. Keleche Osemele also does not fire out of his stance to quickly and his lack of overall athleticism and mobility concerns me to a certain degree with players who can beat him to the inside with their sheer quickness and explosion off the snap. On the few occurrences when Osemele was allowed to run block he did a nice job firing out of his stance and seemed to show much more passion and enthusiasm for getting his hands on someone and driving them off the football. Osemele does need to stay more balanced as tends to stand up and get a little upright in his stance, allowing defenders to get around him with relative ease and missing his assignments. Here Osemele needs to stay more in control and be more balanced as he tends to get off his feet from time to time. Osemele’s inability to change directions very efficiently/quickly are concerning to me and I worry that he has a lot to work on from a technique standpoint overall. His upside and ceiling is high but he is a pretty raw prospect overall that needs some work. Osemele will be a player to watch closely leading up the draft at the various events that prospects are invited to participate in.

It was not long before the elves appeared from beneath the trees. Gullhar was given the task of handing over the staff. The elven leader, BirdsPaintedOnWater looked slightly confused and asked the party what it was. Elysia explained that they believed it was the crystal that they had been sent to find. The elven leader said the crystal in question was a large piece, about the size of a human head, not one attached to a staff.
The hoppiness of my Harvest IPA has finally settled-down somewhat. It's not so much of a hoppy punch in the face (when you take your first sip), anymore. It's a beer that I'll have one small glass of, (maybe) once per week, using it mainly as an aperitif. My buddies drink the sh*t out of it, though. I guess I only like real hoppy ales in the Summer.

As I created my own SoulCollage® deck, I considered how I might include essential oils into my cards since they are such an important part of my life’s story.

Rishi caught the bug while traversing India as a salesman in the 1980s, he said, eventually clocking so many miles on his moped that local reporters picked up the story.

“COUNTERBLAST” was a thin ‘privately printed’ short work, parts of which later appeared in Explorations magazine. Eric originally had a box full, but when my parent’s house burned down in 1999, it was lost with many other things, most unfortunately. Few copies remain. I’ve discovered that it’s being reprinted in an edition of 400 with an added preface, and an essay by Elena Lamberti at the end.
Why? It was pretty simple, really. I didn’t have any passion for it.

The word “sustainability,” it bears remembering, has a perfectly clear meaning. It means, as the word itself suggests, the ability of something to be sustained, either for a set period of time – “sustainable over a twenty year period,” for example – or indefinitely. That was its problem as a green buzzword, because next to nobody wanted to talk about just how long the current crop of “sustainable” tech was actually likely to stay viable (hint: not very long), and even fewer were willing to grapple with the immense challenges facing any attempt to sustain any of today’s technologies into the indefinite future.

We must remember that God made the earth and all that is in it. In Genesis 1:16, “God made two lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.” So we see the moon as the cause of tides on the sea. In verse 14, “let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years”

We’ll talk to the dept. chair about getting you enrolled.” Unfortunately, I was already taking 17 units, so adding 3 more would increase my tuition. No thank you. The professor understood and really respected my desire to learn. I didn’t care about the credit, I was using that class to sit next to Casper twice a week. Nobody but Sophia and the professor knew I wasn’t enrolled.

Teen readers, particularly girls, with an artistic/intellectual side will probably gravitate towards this one. Not only that, the visual encapsulations of her feelings and the sketchbook-as-journal will feel very familiar for a lot of teen readers, who will relate to Paige's troubles in expressing—and moving past—her feelings. I thought the visual aspects of this one were outstanding, both artistically and conceptually, and did a great job of communicating both the story and the more pensive, in-her-head nature of the protagonist.

I learned an important lesson this spring about jumping the gun. I had to re-seed everything because obviously the ground was too cold when I first put the garden in. We also got hit by a no-fair frost a couple weeks ago. Miss Chef and I had covered everything carefully, but we had to replace several tomatoes, and I’m not sure if the peppers will recover sufficiently to produce. Still, I will leave them to their own devices, ‘cause I’m sure they know what to do.

That is certainly the case with today's card, the Princess of Wands. Standing atop a pillar of flame, and with a stripey tiger wending its way around, the most "Sun and Moon" part of the aesthetic of this card is provided by her striped stockings :) With great enthusiasm she holds aloft a red, five-petaled flower, or perhaps one of those mini-windmills, which would certainly spin fast in the updraft from the fire. She is alive with potential, reaching for the stars, fierce and playful. She could yet fall from her podium, but we have to marvel at her courage in climbing it in the first place.

Cleaning was left for my weekday off, so the monsters wouldn't mess everything up as fast as I cleaned.

Over the last twenty years, we’ve had some astonishing cases of truth economy. The most famous for a long time was Bill Clinton’s “I did not have sexual intercourse with that woman” – a vastly preferable version of events, from his point of view, to one he might have given, viz, “She gave me a blow job, and I pleasured her with a cigar”. Less well known but equally brazen was Tony Blair’s denial of having lied to the House of Commons about the WOMD dossier – and Alistair Campbell’s evidence to the Chilcot Committee in relation to the Attorney General.

The Guidance also recognizes that there are various media which can be used to deliver training. It lists some of the different training formats which are available in addition to the traditional classroom or seminar formats, such as e-learning and other web-based tools. However, a company should not lose sight of a risk based approach, so that those employees or third parties deemed the highest risk need to receive the most intensive training. Finally, whatever the format of the anti-bribery training, it should seek to achieve its objective of ensuring that those participating in it develop a firm understanding of what the relevant policies and procedures mean in practice for them.

Following brands have recently spent huge amounts to involve people at a large scale with some serious creative work.

I see and hear Lisa Price and Steve Stoute's intent, but take issue with their execution. I see this advertising approach as irresponsible and isolating. It not only illustrates a "standard" look of a multiracial person, but also subtlety perpetuates the same ol same ol ideals of beauty. I believe Carol's Daughter could have an ad that achieves their goal of inclusivity while portraying women of varying skin tones and nationalities/ethnicities.
Ever since the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiments, for example, the credibility of American health care’s professionalism and ethics have been questioned. In these studies that extended between 1932 and 1972, 600 impoverished and syphilis-infected African-American men were lured by the promise of food and housing into clinical studies that tested the natural affects of syphilis on the human body (that is, without treatment), despite the fact that penicillin had already been introduced as a ground-breaking source of treatment. If not that, then maybe it was the Mississippi Appendectomies that diminished the legitimacy of America’s health care. In this exploitative clinical study, researchers and doctors unnecessarily performed hysterectomies on poor black women, thereby disabling their reproducing capabilities simply to “give young doctors a chance to practice the procedure.”

She eyed that hand, unwilling to touch him, sensing it would give him too much knowledge, too much power. Long musician’s fingers, with an archer’s calluses on the first two.

Second, I went to a Relief Society meeting about square foot gardening, and I borrowed my friend's book that explains the whole concept and what to do (this friend also gave me a bag of peat moss... thanks Katy!).
I do remember Yokohama got gold for their weizen, Nihonkai Ishikawa silver for their pilsner.
Anything to keep me from thinking.
I agree about many of the economic policies. But standard economic theory states that a government ought to restrict public sector spending and divert it to social and private enterprises in order to create sustainable income. Clinton did this. But a government cannot sustain this during wartime.
“The problem is getting people signed on to the idea that there is nowhere for these animals to go,” Williams said, “so funding low-cost spay/neuter clinics and organizations who practice TNR is the way to curb overpopulation and animals dying in shelters.”
No, that isn't how life works. Don't apologize to me unless you step on my foot or punch me in the face or something. Never apologize for not doing something that is going to cause you problems just to make me happy. But that's the kind of guy he is. He apologized in case I was disappointed that he didn't, I don't know, let's say rob a bank for me. Because he was sincerely worried that I might not be his friend anymore or that I was his friend because I thought he'd rob the bank. That is a good friend, because it means I probably could have been a total dick and gotten him to rob the bank for me. And, honestly, I think I could have gotten him to. That is a true friend. But you know what? I'll just take the $3.50 latte you bought me that you can probably expense. Let's not see how far you'll go in fucking up your entire existence. I'll just trust that you care about me without that.

Rick and A.J. give up their Christmas plans to help a little girl find her dad. He owes the mod a lot of money so he goes to Vegas to try and make some money to pay them back. The Simon brothers save the day and help the little girl and dad pay off Eyeball and all is Merry. Well, except for the fact they have to spend Christmas in a Vegas airport lounge...

Adder-wyrms live in all sorts of environments short of arctic cold, and in the tropics they can become something of a pest, as they breed more successfully the warmer and more humid the climate. They are often found underground when food is plentiful.

I chose from among the many quotes and typed them into my word processor. Then I printed the quotes, cut them out and glued them to inexpensive paper plates. Fruit and veggie stickers dress up the plates just a bit. I thought about using pictures of food cut from magazines, but the stickers were easier. I have made a plate for each child, and some will have the same quote. I have ten quotes altogether with ten songs. I did not list the title on the plate. This may be too many songs to get through in twenty minutes. So, if time is short, I can use fewer quotes by removing those plates.
The old man had nothing to say. He did not materialise and say "Why aren't you boys in bed?" (On the night he died we walked too, until dawn).
I called my mom into my room the night Joel died and tried to articulate my questions to her. She told me that even people her age (36 at the time) don’t die very often, and most ten-year-olds have a lot of life to look forward to. But none of that helped me feel better. What I really wanted to ask was, “Does it matter what happened here today? If life is supposed to have a purpose, what was the purpose of this life? I’ve heard of original sin, but what does God do with babies who’ve had no chance to be saints and also don’t deserve an eternity in ehll?” It amazes me how infrequently theologians even try to address this issue. I have to trust a just God that Joel won’t be forgotten.

This weekend would have been a good day to tackle the annual hack and slash on the wild roses, but I just didn't have the energy.
I should be back on track today. Last Saturday we flew down to Sydney (3 hours south) then on a train to Medowie (3 hours north) NSW. Visited my hubbies family who we haven't seen in three years. It was a flying visit as we left here in the wee hours of the morning and back here Monday night. Lucky it was a long weekend here so no one missed school or work. We all agree that we like the warmth of North Queensland and even the slowness.

Something I’d like to read aloud in the car. This used to be a favorite pastime of mine and my husband’s. I also bring all the magazines I’m behind on. Because I read ALL THE TIME, I have no need for a special “beach book.” I ALWAYS find time to read, so it’s not a priority on vacation and I might actually watch t.v (which I don’t do at home) instead!
My mate and I trundled off to The Labia which is definitely one of the best things about living in Cape Town.

Even though I'm not a Yankees fan, even I have to admit that's a nice card of Jeter. On an unrelated note, I'm surprised that there aren't (seemingly) any Mets fans on the blogs anymore. I used to be able to count on both the Yankees and Mets amongst the first teams claimed for any group break - but lately the Mets have been a "random" team more often than not...

I really really really thought I had deposited $640, not $620 like my statement shows. But, alas, the deposit slip revealed the truth. I must have put that $20 in the gas tank. Ugh! OK, all is not lost, no checks bounced, and I made it to another payday. Whew! And then there was the visit to the hairdresser this past Saturday. Ooooooo, a new salon with a spa and a manicurist and a boutique and gormet coffee with treats and a shampoo girl that does more for my attitude than a Xanax or Valium and, ultimately, new prices! I actually thought they had overcharged me...after all, I blew out my own hair. But, no, I was wrong! In fact, I got a $15 break from my hairdresser; correction, at these prices, he's got to be a stylist. Don't get me wrong, he's worth it. I've never had more care-free and healthy hair than I have now but, I have to admit, I had sticker shock. Going from paying $85 for a color and cut to $115 will do that.

If you have too much sugar, your body will try to gather it up, turn it into a soft brown soup, and try to make it slither down the back of your leg before you get to the toilet. If you rub caffeine-enhanced creams onto your face to fight off the sag, your body will hoover up that caffeine and throw it away so it can restore the natural chemical balance, and you will have wasted your money on more of Laboratoire Garnier’s exciting made-up science. (In fact as far as I know, caffeine can’t be ingested via the skin anyway, so you really are wasting your money).

The children…came in droves. Ignoring the pleas of their parents not to get involved, children, teens and young adults left schools and met in the historic Sixteenth Street Baptist church, singing and praying. They were released in groups of 50 to march downtown, and as they did, they were arrested.

Today I wanted to feature a home designed by Alexander Gorlin Architects. Here are a few words taken from Alexander Gorlin Architects about the project: "Our recently completed 12,000 square foot summer house for a family of four in the East End of the Hamptons takes full advantage of its location between the bay and the ocean to offer views of both. With an emphasis on entertaining, the house includes guest suites, staff quarters, an outdoor pool and a rooftop terrace." Sounds amazing to me, I have family near the Hamptons, it is such a beautiful part of the country. I suggest that everyone visits

That’s all in the first paragraph of the piece. Lewis is describing a financial instrument called an asset-backed security, but he doesn’t use the jargon and assume you’ll know what it means. He doesn’t even introduce the term until a few paragraphs later, by which time you’re familiar with the concept. Instead, he uses everyday language and an analogy that intelligent readers can grasp. And he follows up with a kicker – Burry wanted to understand these bonds not because he wanted to invest in them, but because he thought they might fail.
Ladies! (and gents too) if you are looking for a workout that a combo of some great cardio, great core, and incorporates flexibility you’ve gotta try Piloxing! Its absolutely amazing the brainchild of Celebrity trainer Viveca Jensen and its a workout that is focused on making a woman feel great while attempting to reach her goal of getting healthy and in the best possible shape of her life. It makes you feel as her famous motto puts it Sleek, Sexy, Powerful there’s times in which moves are really fun yet girly and sexy, times where you feel like a prima ballerina and times where you feel like a boxing champ ready for the ring. Honestly, this is the best workout I’ve ever done…definitely something that will keep your attention! I was sweating buckets and loving every minute of it, however towards the end I did question if my body could and would make it…I completed the whole hour but it was HARD!

Tour Of The Deep Ocean is a long one. Almost 15 minutes in length, this is the epic track. Plenty of sad violin in the opening, slow and mysterious. Then the guitar comes in, Crimsonesque and all. Nice dark atmosphere and very good build up lead to sizzling keyboards. This is good stuff. A bit repetitive in places, but showing both melody, power and a bit of flashiness. However, it also includes some more introspective parts where the guitar cries out, quite lonely. Some of the melodies could come straight out of a Focus album. After this more accessible and melodic middle part, the repetitive drone of the beginning returns, getting the tension back into the song.

Tension, anxiety and high stress levels because one feels that something is going on but one doesn’t know what it is.
In the United States, there is a “political question doctrine,” pursuant to which courts should decline to resolve certain issues if there is good reason to believe that their resolution is entrusted to the political branches of government (i.e. the executive or the legislature) rather than to the judiciary. Beyond this general statement, however, the “doctrine” is a mess. There is little agreement about what the courts do with the political question doctrine, or what they ought to do.
Governments are starting to wise up to what are the underlying causes of financial disaster around the World. Their response is simple, and if it could be paraphrased, it would be, “It is time to get these bums who think they run the world from behind closed doors — and drown them like the rats they are”.

This week's Walk the Line Diva Challenge really fits in well with the topic of support and support groups. And I'm talking about support for the caregivers, especially, because it does feel sometimes like you're all alone. Presumably, your loved one is getting the support he or she needs in treatment programs, counseling, or with a psychiatrist. Well, that's not entirely true, because sometimes we can't convince our loved one that something is wrong that they even need support for.
I was sad to have left the rest of the bread behind, because I would have loved to pack a focaccia sandwich for my travels.
But funnily enough it wasn’t the game that made all the headlines. As always the back pages were all about a certain Italian international striker. Mario Balotelli was up to his old tricks in a lacklustre display that saw him get sent off for two bad challenges on Bacary Sagna. Yet he should have been dismissed much earlier after a high, studs-up challenge on Alex Song. It was a horrendous challenge that Song was very lucky to escape from unhurt.
Today is my turn to host the new challenge at "Magnolia Stamp Lovers" and for the next two weeks the theme will be easy and one of my favorites "FLOWERS". You need to make a card using any Tilda or Edwin with flowers in their hands or flowers around them. I decided this time to make a paper bag card using one of my favorite Magnolia stamp ("Tilda in the garden"). I'm sorry the pictures are not good but I tried a few times and they either turned too dark or too light.

When I slid the packaged watch across the counter at the post office and walked out, I somehow felt lighter, I felt better, and I didn’t miss the watch anymore. I had been telling myself that when the kids were all grown, I would get another, now I wasn’t so sure. What did it matter?

I find myself engaged in a game. Kind of like a game of poker, only unlike any I’ve ever played before. The cards in play don’t come from a 52 count deck; the game is played with the cards that life has handed us. I can’t see the other players, nor am I sure how many are involved. I don’t think any of that matters. Ultimately, as always, it will boil down only to how I play.
So, it has been a couple days since I have checked in. I have been soo busy…on the 9th of this month I will be going in to get surgery on my lower back (sigh) and I have been trying to get everything in order to prepare. Yesterday I went to my pre op appointment and then picked up my baby girl she was at her grandparents for four whole days! How I missed her, and she started to stand up on things so I missed that moment! Grrr Yes she does it all the time now so I get to see it, but it is not the same as the first time.
I'm in a lovely routine- and the children are thriving on it. There have been more play-dates, and a structure to the contact they have with their dad since our mediation. Yey! Pickle Missy and Little Guy suddenly seem more secure, and confident. My little girl's school report was shining recently, and her brother is very settled and smiley at nursery. And I feel like I'm gaining friends, and making plans, (getting a tiny bit of a social life). Its lovely.

6. Axel F got some vanilla ice cream to put on top, because there really is no substitute for putting vanilla ice cream on apple crisp, especially when it's actually good and crispy apple (and pear) crisp with crunchy almonds and toasty, brown sugary, buttery coconut. Thanks again to him for these quality photos, especially considering the surpassingly poor quality of our camera and lighting situation.*don't skimp and use sweetened flake coconut, that stuff is gross and doesn't really taste like coconut. The unsweetened flake coconut, like this, is totally different, and worth a trip to Whole Foods for. It actually has a very fine texture - tiny little flakes, rather than being big thick ribbons, so it's an excellent flour substitute in this situation.

And I love reading blogs while I eat my toast with cheese, watching various family members stumble out of bed to their cups of coffee. Sometimes they give me the “you-are-a-blessed-saint” look and sometimes I get the “you-are-a-crazed-earlybird” look. But I’m thankful to have them around. I know a lot of kids go off to college and that’s a wonderful opportunity. But we also know lots of people saddled with undergrad and grad school debt, who make life choices based on their debt. Scholarships and living at home during their undergrad years should free our kids of that burden, especially since there’s a major university a couple of miles from our home.
Similarly, in David Cronenberg’s Spider (2002), one crucial character slowly shifts to look like another as the film progresses, and it is by means of this shift that crucial information is revealed. In a film such as Oldboy (2004) or Cut (2004, included on the omnibus release Three Extremes) by Park Chan-Wook, it is likely that the entire film-world is as if the dream of a character not depicted in these films, which yet needs to be postulated in order to unify the character fragments who compose the ‘characters’ of the film. If Mulholland Drive is a supra-individual film in which some notion of a world beyond creeps through, this possibility seems to vanish in Park’s films, and yet, these films retain their coherence because of the clarity of its mirrorings, plot-twists, and other structuring devices. While these may not be those of the so-called ‘real’ world, they increasingly feel more and more relevant as the world begins to look more and more like aspects of these films.
I have about 15 rolls of film to burn through… so look forward to a few more posts with the best of the best that I shoot. The softness of the shots are kind of refreshing when you are used to sharp digital photos everywhere…
