With this legislation, we would see a quickly increasing number of distracting digital billboards, which independent traffic safety researchers have concluded cause an excessively high level of driver distraction.

Eight of us had flown down the night before to Bahía Tortugas, a dusty seaside town of 2,000-plus almost exactly halfway down the west side of the Baja Peninsula between San Diego and Cabo San Lucas.

One issue, of course, is a more than two-year federal probe into corruption in county government. The investigation spurred the reform effort last year.
He talks about academics who have moved out of the state and the difficulty of hiring replacements for them. But did it occur to him that the business and tax environments of Gov. Martin O'Malley, Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller and House Speaker Michael Busch are so unattractive that many people would prefer to stay where they are or go to more favorable states than Maryland?

As recently in October, Stepp gave some evidence to Wichita police, who wanted to send it to Scotland Yard. Investigators there had developed new technology for detecting fingerprints, even ones that had been wiped off. The evidence was tested but nothing turned up, Stepp said.
“The amount of prescription drugs turned in by the American public during the past three Take-Back Day events speaks volumes about the need to develop a convenient way to rid homes of unwanted or expired prescription drugs,” said DEA Administrator Michele M.

At NorCal, the competition was now regularly lifting crates 12 feet in the air, but the girls' performance and elegant design earned them second place overall and advancement to a World Championship tournament for the fourth year in a row. With little realistic hope of winning a judged award out of 128 championship teams, and no chance of beating teams that were rumored to be hitting venue ceilings, the girls decided to refocus their time on their schoolwork and much-neglected friends. However, it wasn't long before their competitive instincts kicked in and they were back in the Terra Nova robotics room planning out anything and everything they could do to improve their chances at Worlds. They decided to focus on reliability and driving practice, even calling upon fellow NorCal teams to spar with them and focus on nothing but trying to thwart Archie, renamed after their robot's new Archimedes screw drive, from scoring.
The witness has refused to cooperate any further, forcing prosecutors to drop the second-degree assault charges against the six boys and one girl, court spokesman Matt Murphy confirmed. He would not provide any more detail about the witness, given that it is a juvenile court matter.

Margaret Hance became the first female mayor of Phoenix -- the largest American city with a woman in charge. Hance was a conservative Republican who was a product of the city's reforming Charter Government Movement, but the movement endorsed another candidate -- whom she beat. Hance's name graces a downtown park that spans Interstate 10.
"I don't believe in politicians or even in the law anymore," said Ali, whose husband died years ago of liver failure. "A police officer beat me for selling on the black market. Another beat my son.

Among those who did not receive a warning when the Lower North Fork fire broke out March 26 was Ann Appel, 51, who called 911 earlier in the day concerned that smoke from a wildfire was going over her house.

ø"I remember coming up to the plate," said Snow, now a special assistant for the San Francisco Giants who was hitting .408 with six home runs after his first 15 games for the California Angels. "Clemens threw a fastball over my head. I didn't say anything. I just watched him come halfway toward the plate, get a new ball from the umpire, and he smiled. That was old school."
"Green is the natural complement to red on the color wheel," noted Rachel Skafidas, Dutch Boy Paints color and design specialist. "However, you can virtually pair any color family with red. The tricky part is making sure the values and intensities of the colors pair well."

But an opinion that in theory is eminently just threatens to result in a manifest injustice in Baltimore. At first blush, the high court's ruling appears to bolster the case of former Baltimore Catholic school teacher John J. Merzbacher, who was sentenced to four life terms on six counts of child rape and sexual abuse and faced 100 other charges for similar crimes. He destroyed dozens of lives, and despite his age (70) and years in prison, his victims still fear for themselves, their children and for the community. But a federal judge agreed last year with his contention that he was never informed of a plea offer, and that echoes the circumstances of one of the cases the Supreme Court addressed this week. For what he has done, Mr. Merzbacher deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison. Fortunately, the court ruling leaves open several avenues for Maryland officials to make sure he does.
It was midafternoon on a recent Saturday -- ideal weather for lawn work or bike riding -- but at Townhouse bistro in Birmingham, every sidewalk table was filled with diners enjoying drinks and a late lunch in the sun.
The Answer: There are a few of them. One is that we always have the right answer, which we don't. Secondly, that it's a really, really tough job, because some days it isn't that tough. But other days, it's not an easy job. People think, "Well, anybody can be the boss." But there are days when it actually is pretty tough. . . . In any job, there are some days you get paid too much, some days you don't get paid enough, and hopefully, most days it just works out right.
Even the United Nations is rumored to be looking to expand its drone capacity. They initially would be used for surveillance supporting U.N. peacekeeping missions. Although Obama has been a vocal supporter of the U.N. since he entered the White House, it is unclear whether he will publicly back U.N. drone use or share American drone technology with U.N. peacekeeping teams.

Cotto came out looking slow and overmatched in the first round, but quickly settled into a routine, attacking Mayweather from behind his left jab.

"I know if Raymond, or Wes, or LA or Gerald is telling me something, it's coming from a good place," Crawford said. "It's not coming to nit-pick, it's coming because it's going to make our team better. So whenever you have that, you have the foundation for something."
Although Oregon's dry side was bypassed by the oil and gas boom that roiled the West in recent years, it's clear that won't be the case with wind. That could change the view from atop Steens Mountain or on Interstate 84 while driving toward Boise. But it also portends some bitter fights over who gets to use publicly owned land and for what purpose.
And candidates such as Damon will be hurt also by what promises to be a backlog of players on the ballot. At this point, no player associated with performance enhancers, such as Mark McGwire and Rafael Palmeiro, has been elected, nor fallen beneath the 5 percent that would take them off the ballot. I suspect the same will happen to players such as Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens and others. Thus, Damon will have to fight through a congested ballot with, at best, a borderline case.
According to the information, Coyne also ran a fraud beginning in March in which he invited an investor to invest in a new Krispy Kreme doughnut franchise in Brunswick. That investor then wrote Coyne two checks totaling $32,000 in April. However, Coyne had never discussed the franchise plan with Krispy Kreme, the information states.

I don't really know where the frogs come from. They just seem to appear every spring. Unfortunately, most are bullfrogs, which eat the baby fish and the little tree frogs. By summer's end, the bullfrogs will have disappeared, and I suspect that Orville and Wilbur have had a hand, or paw, in that. I don't like to think too deeply about this.
It is less a comment on marriage than on the notion that marriage is the holy grail of a woman's existence, the finish line of her life's hopes, dreams and goals. That is a fable upon which the Walt Disney Company built an empire. But the fable is not confined to the multiplex. To the contrary, you can see it played out on a weekly basis in the headlines of any given publication in your local supermarket checkout line. Consider one of the most recent big stories from the Land of the Beautiful People.

My schedule, too, is set to music. I've heard endless stories of young mothers rising at 5 a.m. to fit in a few hours of writing before the children were up, but I can barely make coffee at 5 a.m. My productive hours are between 9 and 3, an elementary school schedule, once the only predictable part of my working day (unless one of the children got an ear infection and then all bets were off). If I go out for lunch and interrupt my rhythm, I'm sunk. I think that all of those lunches were what diminished Truman Capote's output.

I just keep thinking how tragic it is that Jones's plan worked. There's an awful fatalism to how these things compute in the internet world. Evil in. Evil out. Terry Jones glows in the spotlight and pretends he thinks the loss of life is a tragedy. He doesn't. Like Yertle the Turtle, he savors the view from his elevated throne, built on the bodies of those who died in Afghanistan.

For Whedon, Cabin in the Woods' third-place start is a victory in that it meant the film escaped the shelf upon which it had been sitting since its original studio, MGM, went bankrupt. The film is so old that its star, Thor's Chris Hemsworth, wasn't a star when it was made—and Whedon wasn't Hemsworth's director in the upcoming Avengers, either.

Should win: Clooney. It was the most fully realized performance of the five, with Clooney inhabiting the devastated Matt King, struggling to keep his daughters and himself afloat in the wake of his wife's coma. He was also willing not to play charming-gorgeous George. But it's a close call, because Dujardin will benefit from all the love for "The Artist."

WASHINGTON -- When Hillary Rodham Clinton made her first trip to China in 2009, barely a month into her tenure as secretary of state, she said that U.S. concerns about human rights should not interfere with other pressing global issues on which the United States and China could find common ground. Human rights advocates were appalled, and under orders from the White House, Clinton softened her remarks the next day.

Dear Margo: I'm experiencing a problem I assume other medical professionals experience. I'm a graduate student in a medicinal chemistry and drug design program, but I'm considering telling people I've just met that I clean houses for a living. Don't get me wrong, I love and am proud of what I do. The problem arises when I explain that my work has ties to the pharmaceutical industry. Upon hearing this, many middle-aged and older people begin telling me about the drugs they take. Often, the person inadvertently tells me a lot more about their medical history than they intended, because I know why each of their drugs is prescribed. A few times, people have even confided in me that they take a lower dose than their doctor told them to, or they don't always pick up drugs their doctor calls in. How do I get myself out of these conversations so that I can enjoy a party? And how do I explain that these are conversations they should be having with their doctor (about not taking the correct dosage, or not taking drugs prescribed to them), and not with a new acquaintance at a party? — Cornered

I love baseball and the experiences that come with working with a Major League baseball team, such as traveling to other cities and countries, building relationships with local and national writers, producers, reporters and photographers, and working with a number of players and coaches.

Outside of the lawsuits, Cedar Fair faces another possible roadblock: The acquisition needs approval from holders of at least two-thirds of the company's outstanding shares. Investors will be able to vote by mail or at a shareholder meeting that will happen 20 days after the company mails its proxy statement, which contains information on the merger, to shareholders. When that happens depends on how quickly the report is approved by the SEC, said Cedar Fair spokeswoman Stacy Frole.Getting the required votes might not be a breeze, since the company has few large, institutional shareholders, Thomison said. About 75 percent are small-time individual investors who could make their decision based more on emotions than number-crunching.

'TIS THE SEASON: This is awards season for the hot rod crowd. The St. Louis Auto Racing Fan Club holds a nice event. Same for Tri-City Speedway. Ditto the Allied Auto Racing Association. Not as local as the others, but packing a mighty financial wallop is the annual DIRTcar Racing UMP Night of Champions awards banquet.

Almost $400,000 in prize money was awarded to the top drivers of 2010, including several area racers.

Arda: I liked what Daniel Bryan said in a recent interview about feeling this match will be very stiff. Bryan has been on fire lately with his character, and unfortunately for Sheamus, all eyes are on DBryan going into WrestleMania, despite Sheamus having won the Royal Rumble. The prevalent thought in my mind is, "how will Daniel Bryan find a sneaky, conniving way to leave WrestleMania as champion"? And that's what I'm predicting. I'm also guessing that this rivalry won't end at WrestleMania and we will see a PPV rematch with an added stipulation to account for how Daniel Bryan keeps his title at WrestleMania.

His own dad — the first Henry, and the grandfather of Giants fullback Henry Hynoski Jr. — was a poignant example: A star linebacker during the Depression, he was offered a scholarship to play at Fordham during the Lombardi years. But his mother, a widow just off the boat from Poland, incapable of grasping what it all meant, had other plans: Her son was going to work to help support the family, and the only place to do that was in the mines.
SPORTS are tribal. We line up with our team, our school, our city; paint our faces Trojan colors, dye our hair Dodger blue. We immerse ourselves in the history, in the rivalries: Magic against Larry, John Roseboro against Juan Marichal, Al Davis against the world. This is how we place ourselves, how we reckon with our lives. It is what Don DeLillo, in his novel "Underworld" — which opens with Bobby Thomson's "shot heard 'round the world"— calls our "secret history," something "that joins [us] all in a rare way, that binds [us] to a memory with protective power."

One lasting belief about "The Awakening" is that the Post-Dispatch panned it. This is untrue. Chopin was friends with Post-Dispatch writers and this newspaper's review in 1899 was overwhelmingly positive. Many other reviewers, including Willa Cather (!), believed that Chopin's subject was not fit for a novel. To compare what reviewers said about "The Awakening," go to a University of Virginia website that has several reviews. It includes the Globe-Democrat's assessment ("it is not a healthy book"). The Post-Dispatch's C.L. Deyo says
