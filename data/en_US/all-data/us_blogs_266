When death interferes with your plans, it knocks you in the stomach! It may knock you down and you find it is just too hard to get back up again, especially if you have just lost your spouse and you are all alone. You may even wonder if God has left you too, because you feel so lonely and so empty inside.
But, the healing of that long, angry scar is not the biggest change. Rather, at least for now, the irritations that used to send me into orbit seem inconsequential. The insatiable drive to move my career forward has abated. And, I’ve even started driving politely, even deferentially, in rush hour traffic.

Eberhard Havekost’s paintings are blurry. This simple fact is what makes the painting complicated. Something has to precede the act of blurring. Even his most color stroked works can’t help but suggest they come from somewhere, from a photograph, from a landscape, from an image of some sort. For this reason, some commentators refer to Havekost’s paintings as spectral, as haunted, inhabited by spirits and ghosts. We don’t know the ghosts but we suspect their presence. Other commentators prefer the idea that his works are paintings that don’t want to represent, that play on the idea of painting’s ultimate failure to provide any firm reality, that work the gap between what is and what is speakable and knowable. Whatever your orientation in the debate (I promise I take a firm stand in this myself), something is blurred and that something, though displaced and removed from us through the blurring, is quietly present in every Havekost exhibition.

Speaking of which, the ending inspired in me such anger, anxiety, and various negative emotions within me – after finishing the book, I sat there for a whole twenty minutes, blabbing on about a lack of closure and how my copy must have been damaged because that seriously could not have been the ending. But, unfortunately, it was – and I’m fairly sure that it was intended to be as lacking in closure and lacking in mercy as it was. To some extent, it was happy and sufficient, but to another extent, it felt incomplete, like the author had taken the easy way out. It was just … disheartening, I suppose, that the ending was so vague whereas everything had been so lovingly detailed.

I remember when I first read White Cat, I liked but wasn’t going crazy for it. And after I read it and stewed on it for a bit I realized how clever the storytelling was and how incredible the book was…and that’s how I felt about this series ever since. I started Black Heart and only after reading two pages, I’m already back in the story and back into Cassel’s world.

For a long time I didn’t know what this thing was about. It was written by request of Ace, who wanted to write a song where one camouflaged drugs with candy. Strange right? But somewhere in the writing process I found out that I wanted it to be about just not giving a rat’s ass. The interpretation of that is for anyone to decide. It’s without a doubt this song that I want a 4th grader to analyze. It contains so much mumbo jumbo that only a kid would understand it. But like most of our songs there is a subliminal message. I’ve just forgotten what it is.

Now, I understand and believe in charity. But the followers of this "philosophy" of theft via taxes given out as entitlements are not talking about voluntary giving, voluntary charity. They are not talking about reaching down into their pocket to provide. They feel it is perfectly acceptable to reach their hands down into your pocket, whether you like it or not. And they will take a grope while they are down there, just to make sure you aren't a terrorist.
I hear it’s common for Americans to miss peanut butter. I never had an issue with peanut butter until today when the grocery store closest to me ran out. They’ve been out all week so I finally came to the conclusion that they no longer carried it. But, one of the perks of living where I do is that there is another grocery store 25 yards away.
I told the group that after the C1 class I had essentially gotten more of what I already had, especially increased empathic ability. I said that had found myself working more as a psychic and medical intuitive than a channeler, meaning that I was receiving useful information and relaying it to patients, but I wasn’t getting that information from entities other than myself. I had been in touch with various beings, but I generally couldn’t get verbal messages, and I often couldn’t tell one being from another. I was hoping to develop more as a medium, I said, with clearer and more definite communication.

From Felix Salmon I learn of a paper by Liesbeth Colen and Johan Swinnen which looks at the correlation between income and beer consumption. Interestingly the authors find that the relationship is non-linear and in fact has an inverted U-shape suggesting that beer consumption rises with wealth, but then declines as richer consumers switch to things like wine and spirits.
Thus Said might well have preferred various Arab states to the Israeli state. After all, many far-leftists once preferred communist Russia to the US or UK. Why can’t Said have preferred Egyptian or even Pakistani 'democracy' to Israel’s democracy? In fact one likely candidate for a better regime, and even a better democracy (though not a parliamentary democracy) for Said was Iran in the early days of the revolutionary regime (perhaps also later). Perhaps he preferred Iran’s system to Israel’s when writing this (in 1982 and 1996). Chomsky, for example, thinks that the US is a ‘Nazi state’ which needs to be ‘denazified’. It will not be surprising, then, that Said too thought that Israel was a Nazi state which needs denazifying. In fact he did. He saw Israel as being in many ways fascistic or Nazi in nature (as do virtually all far leftists today).

Well let me tell you something. If you were followed around and interviewed on the regular after your job, interrogated for statements made by your peers and outside sources that you didn’t even hear about yet, how would you feel to be ridiculed for being a good guy that works hard in a world cluttered with laziness and fake personalities? Of course it comes with the profession of being in the NFL. I’m just trying to show you how these athletes are people just like you and I, they’re getting paid the big bucks to be physical specimens and public figures as well.

I even managed to run today. Of course, I leave the house and it's gloomy and overcast (which is actually my favorite running weather), and I get to the park and it's sunny and hot, and I finish running and it goes back to gloomy and overcast. So, I was randomly super overdressed for my 3 mile run. That kind of sucked. But, it got done. Woot.

During the hour-long Gathering, my daughter did whisper at times with a friend, and crammed in a little bit of last-minute summer Spanish homework. But she also smiled over at me during favorite songs and at moments when a phrase or thought resonated with her. She may have been half-listening, but she was also continuing to soak up good stuff, including the sense of support from a multigenerational community, and intellectual content including a reflection on the pre-Judaic origins of the Sabbath among the ancient Sumerians.

When you're playing your guitar, you don't waste time wishing its out-of-tune strings were in tune, wondering how the strings got out of tune in the first place, thinking there is something wrong with a guitar that needs tuning. You just tune the damn thing and get on with your song. It's not a moral issue. The guitar doesn't need counseling or coaching or a 12-step program to help it stay in tune. What it needs is to be played, and listened to.

It’s a cliché that modernism privileges visuality, but start exploring the MoMA with Art Project and there are some paintings you literally cannot see; works that due to the exploitability of their image rights elsewhere have been rendered fat with pixels like innocent faces in a cop-stop-action show on Channel 5. They exist, and occupy their rightful space in the museum, that you can be sure of; you are merely not allowed to look at them.

While I could have taken my overnight trip on the weekend, I decided to take it midweek due to our schedules. This way we wouldn't need a baby sitter. All Rob had to do was put the kids down for bed and walk them to school the next day. Then, I could pick them up from school after I checked out from the hotel. Simple and easy. Taking it midweek also had its advantages. I felt like I got an extra Saturday this week (really trying to take advantage of leap year!)

Hood took a test draw on his recently-filled pipe and then charred the surface of the tobacco. As he gently re-tamped the tobacco and re-lit the pipe, Hood took a few puffs and then set his lighter on a small pine table next to his chair. Hood had taken up pipe smoking after retiring from the Marines. His father had smoked a pipe and his father before him. In Hood’s family, a man was expected to enjoy a good pipe in the evening once he reached a certain age. Those who took up the pipe at too early an age were frowned upon. The pipe was a sign of maturity and enjoyment relegated only to those who had earned the right.

When you teach people that the gospel of the grace of God does not include water baptism, occasionally someone will ask the question about Acts 2:38. This happened to me a few weeks ago on a Sunday morning. This is a legitimate question because Acts 2:38 says, “Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.”

I didn’t know why kids got made fun of for wearing them. Kids with braces were called “Brace Face” and kids with glasses were called, “Four Eyes.” I always thought that was mean. There were kids who would come to school, wearing their cat eye glasses, only to put them away in their case and squint their eyes at the board all damn day. Hell, I thought that looked stupid. “Four Eyes” sounded so much better than “Stupid Squinty Head.”

Make A List! Look at your SMART goals and break them down. What am I going to need to meet my goal. Do I need new clothes? Do you have a space dedicated to your goal? DO YOU EVEN KNOW HOW TO GET STARTED? It’s a simple process that is often overlooked or just attacked as it comes up in the future. Like 2 months in your sneakers break and you now have no footwear to go to the gym in and you will then miss a week or two of your workouts because you for some reason or another do not go and get new ones. Do you need music to help keep you focused while you workout? What kind of workouts will you be doing? Are you going(and you should) follow a specific program that will progress as you progress or are you going to go into it unprepared and expect miracles? MOST PEOPLE EXPECT MIRACLES.

Well I'm back. Have you missed me? It's just been so busy around here the last few weeks. Looking back I can't really remember what all we've been up to...but take my word for it, we've had lots going on. Since I last posted, Beau's been to DC and I've been to Chicago, Atlanta and Birmingham for work. We've all been sick and this week we've been working on our taxes (nothing like waiting until the last minute!) and lots of other stuff that is slipping my mind. I really wish that there was some way for me to think things and it end up on this blog without me having to type it all out. There would be all kinds of profound and funny things on here. Maybe one day.

#86: Guest speaker. I showed up to my Wednesday class only to find that nobody was there. It turns out, the professor sent a cancellation email to apparently everyone but me… but in exchange, we were required to see a guest speaker (and I can’t for the life of me remember her name), but she went to Cranbrook for art school, and ended up in San Fransisco and NYC as well. She had an interesting life, and I’m glad I went, but she talked mostly about her personal life, and not her design projects. In fact, she skipped several interesting-looking slides because of the time restraints. I ended up running into a lot of friends there though, so it was definitely worthwhile!

I think what bothers me about this whole initiative is the way it has been played out in the classroom. Because of the conscious effort that teachers are trying to make in differentiating their reading program, I am finding that gender differences are being leveraged in a way that segregates students and creates negative stereotypes within the class. Rather than celebrating differences, the differences are merely identified… and it is up to the students themselves to discern whether or not these differences are positive or negative.

Beyond the use of POWs as slaves, many became slaves through debt, through inheritance, through conviction of a crime, or sometimes through outright kidnapping. Some of these types of slavery are indeed permitted under the Old Law. However it really would be a stretch to say that it “endorses” slavery as some sort of universal and timeless good. It appears, in my admittedly layman’s view, to be on the level of dietary restrictions, or allowances for polygamy. They were once commanded or allowed by God, but with the advent of the New Covenant and the New Israel, they became moot. What about the New Testament though? Doesn’t St. Paul say that slaves should obey their masters?

Broadly, the Stanislavski ‘system’ strives to achieve truth in performance by drawing on the inner creativity and imagination of the actor to allow every action to be stimulated by the inner machinations of the given character. Essentially what this means is that the average drama student spends the vast majority of his or her time scrabbling about looking for a ‘brooch’ that, however well meaning, a ‘friend’ shouldn’t have stuck in a curtain and trying to find the essential truth of that action. The rest of their time is taken up with sitting around while their fellow students discuss all the reasons why they sucked at the exercise.

Time passed, and I silently walked on. I was starving. I had eaten my last of my food supply a day before I had wandered back into the city. There was no point in looking for any while I was there, I had already done so countless times. I couldn’t go back this time, even if on accident. I felt so empty inside that my hunger pains did not hurt anymore. I needed food, but my stomach felt so disconnected from my brain that general physical pain and emotional pain felt no different from the pain of hunger. In fact, the hunger pains seemed to dwindle in comparison.

Around four texts were individually wrapped in a small plastic pouch. I was so obsessed with Ghost fighter that I would open the plastic wrappings, take the really pretty text cards, and put back the ugly ones, and seal the plastic back again. I did not realize that I was putting back text cards that were the same. My classmate Bernice irritated when she saw that the texts she bought had the same picture.

Denny Hamlin. Denny is so strong at his home track. He was came from nowhere in last night’s Nationwide race to come up a lap short of the victory. He was quick in practice and qualified in the top 10. If Denny is not our first back-to-back winner this season, I’ll be disappointed. The only person Denny has to beat at Richmond is himself.

Munch wrote of how the painting came to be: “I was walking down the road with two friends when the sun set; suddenly, the sky turned as red as blood. I stopped and leaned against the fence, feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear. Then I heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature.” He later described the personal anguish behind the painting, “for several years I was almost mad… You know my picture, ‘The Scream?’ I was stretched to the limit—nature was screaming in my blood… After that I gave up hope ever of being able to love again.”
One-Layer Wednesday 87, which closes in about thirty minutes, is to make a one-layer card that is not square or rectangular. I used this fabulous teacup template from Paperlicious Designs, which I cut out by hand. The inside of the handle was fussy to cut out, but worth it, I think. The only change to the design was to cut the bottom of the card straight across instead of curved so it would stand up better. I used Stampin' Up Baby Blossoms for the flowers.
I FINALLY finished the lawn and tried to head inside and he kept insisting I stay out and hang out with him. I managed to get away, but seriously. He sucks. I'm so ready for him to move out (crossing fingers he really leaves at the end of December).

For any contracts and agreements entered into on or after May 1, Fannie said it reserves the right to change pricing “one or more times” during the term. It would provide the lender with a written notice before any changes are made, and if the lender disagrees with new terms, either party could cancel the arrangement.
I'm not too sure why they are called one thing on Facebook, but their website has another name. It would have been better to remain consistent in their business name to avoid confusion. Nevertheless, they have a really large (and I mean like, abundant) variety of apparel, accessories, false eyelashes and shoes on their website. This great in some ways (because there is just so much to choose from), but also terrible because..
Where do you go from there? Good creative knows to follow the brief. Great creative takes what's in the brief and spins the key message to make it relevant to audience. It's how we weave our gossamer web of creativity, threading strategy and problem solving into the tapestry of our work. Creatives need facts to start this process. Good creatives get it. Great creatives crave it and can't start working without it.
Why? Because that is the rule and the student knew from day one of the course that this was the rule. Why else? Because the student assumed that the rules didn't apply in this particular case. The student never took responsibility (or apologized) for missing the exam - blame was placed on the family, then on the class rule, then on the instructor for being mean and unprofessional.

It’s not often I walk away from health-related appointments feeling empowered. Generally, I just feel depressed. With Julie, however, I was encouraged to listen to and take credit for my body. To understand its temperaments and realize its potential. After all, everything we need for physical and emotional health is already present and living dormant within our bodies. It’s just a matter of exploring the possibilities.
I've gone for the old cop out of bands doing whole albums... Again, this list could be endless so I've not included bands who I've seen since they reformed but missed when they were originally together, such as The Sex Pistols and The Velvet Underground... And obviously the reformed Pixies are keeping their flame alive with plenty of live work... Morrissey almost fills the gap left by The Smiths... so this list is made up of sets you're not likely to see anytime soon... in no particular line-up order as that would be an impossible task...
All buildings incorporate a range of floor coverings. For instance, offices are usually carpeted, kitchens and toilets usually contain sheet vinyl or stone tile. Whatever the floor type, each has its own particular characteristics, one of which will be their ability to resist slips when people travel across them.
A slip of the tongue was probably the trigger for a conversation I overheard the other night on our way to the baseball game. I tuned in when MJ was explaining to 9yo Emma that she is allowed to use "bad" words. Someone asked by whom she was allowed, and she replied, "My mom." My grandma asked her not to use them in front of her. My mom asked for clarification about when she is allowed to use them. MJ admitted (with that word describing her tone of voice) that she isn't supposed to use them in front of grandparents.
He slips the leaf back to her when she reaches out for it. It seems she might already regret those words, but no amount of rubbing them out will rub them from Mesdan’s mind now. Eliss doesn’t consider him a true man. The knowledge makes him burn.
That is what I've done here: I've shared 365 designs and taught you how to use them. I'm the creator, but I have absolutely no idea of all the million of ways these designs can be used and stitched beautifully on quilts and other projects.

When I was much younger, I told one of my sister's that I wished I had time to exercise. The ridiculousness of that statement by a young teen with no responsibilities except school is not lost on me. My sister said,"You have time, it's just a matter of priority."
In any case, I’ve got some work to do, chickens.
Please don’t think I’m promoting the “Jesus is my boyfriend!” mentality. Not at all. I’m saying we shouldn’t feel guilty about our literary crushes. Rather, understand that we’re created with a sense of what’s pure and lovely and beautiful. We’re attracted to those things, even as they’re displayed in book characters. Don’t feel guilty—delight in this! And look to Jesus.

Happy to see the support of all those still participating. Word up to Daniel Franklin who has done a superb amount of reading this month - puts the rest of us to shame, I reckon *grins* Also, I just want to note for those who have joined later to the Challenge, we're actually dealing with fantasy, science fiction and horror - Christian thriller/suspense probably doesn't fit under that banner.

-About those hubbies...Justin has grown to be just fine with cloth diapering. Would he be sad if we stopped? No. Would he do cloth diapering if it wasn't for me? No way. However, he's 100% on-board and I so appreciate his open mind! For the daddies out there...his favorite are the hook and loop (velcro) cloth diapers because they are the most similar to disposables. He also prefers not so spray off the poo diapers, but just throw it into the bag.

If ever there was a government more determined to make life a misery for its citizens, I cannot recall one like the present administration. Under Obamacare, would the rescue squad have to cut back on its hours of service? Would the x-rays be deemed optional? Would I get the pain pills the same day or would a panel of bureaucrats decide if I really needed them?
How funny. I didn’t know that. DId you?
Even more interestingly, though, is his recent admission that he is a Laker fan by way of Magic Johnson. This presents to much more to consider, particularly Magic’s historic rivalry with Larry Bird. It compounds my idea of sports as an extension of our lives, causing me to examine the story of two strong-willed and highly skilled opponents, engaging in a repeated battle to the metaphorical death.

Honestly not quite as impressed with this set although they were still quite tasty. It's hard to compete with five different sours I'll admit. The Perdition, a Biere de Garde, smelled spicy and sort of farmhousey. Lots of wheat up front with some sweetness following to mellow out those flavors. Not bad for a wheat beer. Rejection, a Belgian dark ale, was decent enough that we got a growler of it later. Smelled roasty with a bit of bread. Tasted similar to a porter but with a Belgian twist. The Mortification, a Quadrupel, was a slight let down (although I was distracted when tasting it so that probably didn't help). Sort of syrupy and burning without the lovely fig, plum and other fruit notes that Belgian quads usually have.

An image of being initiated into the Catholic Church during Easter Vigil just popped into my mind. Before that, I was thinking about having to get married in the Church just to keep status as a Roman Catholic in good standing for the sake of being a chaplain. Um, yuck!! I enjoy my heathenism far too much, I really do. As one of my good friends told me before, who is an Atheist, I shouldn’t let something dictate to me my life when I don’t agree with it on a fundamental level. Which, duh, hello, thanks Captain Obvious, but sometimes you just need those friendly reminders, ya know?

Kids are bouncing off the walls, so I think we may get out for a bit and burn off all that pent up energy. :)
It’s also the visual equivalent of a hands free headset: it will make you look like an idiot. No one else can see your screen, so they will think you’re just staring blankly at a wall whilst madly tapping at a disconnected keyboard. This isn’t a cool look for anyone, let’s be honest. At least with a normal screen you can look away from it at will (have you tried looking away from your own cornea?) and share whatever you’re laughing hysterically at with other people. Imagine laughing hysterically at a wall whilst everyone stares at you.
There is one bus that often runs late. It disgorges its kids after the bell at the primary school and I see high school kids getting more and more anxious waiting for it. I'd never seen this guy before, so surmised he was year 7. He was clearly worried.

But there is a problem with gaysex right now. Gaysexuals are attempting to pervert the definition of marriage. Dan’s outburst is designed to continue this push towards an eventual-perversion of marriage and it’s plain to see to all.

If you want to experience the salvation of one who is lost they must see the better way. That is why the command of 2 Timothy 4:2 is to “Preach the word.” One is not to dwell on one’s past life but the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is the Holy Spirit that convicts men of their sin and not the words or stories we could produce.

“It’s all about the money.

Most of the problems in obstetrics are doctors trying to hurry the process up or slow it down.”

Until then I'm just going to stick to the goals I've had for the past year: keep on write, write everyday, finish something, self publish it.

I was really surprised with District 13: Ultimatum. I rarely watch foreign films but this one managed to break my stereotyping. With its exhilarating action, energized stunt moves and strategic location, I can’t help but be sucked into the story and the setting. The one thing that pulled this one down was the third act of the film where the movie couldn’t really find room to breathe and the story broke down. I was disappointed with the ending since the build-up was fantastic, but despite the film’s wrongdoings it still deserves a good grade for a good effort.
Now then. PPB bloggers, please add your post-specific link below, and everyone have a super-fantastic fun-filled weekend!!!

#731 - Great Expectations (1946) - (#335 on TSPDT) David Lean's films tend to be long and drawn out and often quite tedious. Granted, they usually look great, but still, for better and for worse, they have no real feel to them. With that said, I must admit to actually enjoying this rather truncated version of the Dickens classic. Even with its silly, happy ending. Does this make me a bad person? Oh well.
We got to OKC, which in addition to 27,000 runners (Full, Half and 5K, plus Kid’s) had prom, an arts festival and the OKC THUNDER playoff game going on. All within about a 10 block area. The traffic. OY! Did I mention the entire downtown is under construction as well?
One good way to shift those feelings and get yourself back to a place where you can begin to work on the actual actions you need to take to change something in your life, is by getting physical. Call it exercise, call it movement . . . (More)
Through finding the Divine behind our facades of differences, the above joke may evolve until it becomes, “A person of the Jewish faith, a person of the Muslim faith, and a person of the Catholic faith walk into a room where they find people of every faith that exist on Earth. There, a woman from the Buddhist tradition asks the host to “make me one with everything”, and every mind in the room suddenly recognizes that, no matter what path we travel, we all come from the same creator.
I'm currently at a data workshop in Sacramento, CA, where so much has already gone wrong and I've been so low on sleep that the only words that would conceivably come out of my mouth right now are not ones that you will want to hear. We'll just say that, in addition to workshop-related issues and sleep-deprivation issues, the internet in this hotel is probably the slowest thing I've ever experienced. But I was prepared! I had uploaded the photos into a draft post this past weekend before leaving, so that all I'd have to do is type up a post, schedule it to go up, and call it good. Except that the photos deleted themselves while I was writing, and of course this oh-so-efficient Blogger platform auto-saves every 2.3582 seconds. And it saved. Without the inexplicably-deleted pictures. So awesome, right?

The eagle-eyed (and possibly OCD afflicted) amongst you will notice one or two textural differences twixt script and published comic, the most notable one being the punchline. I don’t know about you guys, but “Mortal Kombat” just strikes me as being more in keeping with the tone of the piece, although I would accept that “Streetfighter II Turbo Champion Edition” was probably the better game at the time. If we’re being nerdish about it though, “Killer Instinct” rinsed them both, as did the likes of Soul Caliber, Capcom vs. SNK 2, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and King of Fighters 1 and 2, even though I didn’t discover them until years later and none of them happened to feature Chun Li upside down scissor-kicking the arses of hairy blokes crouching with their tongues hanging out and producing tons of static electricity or dodgy bald geezers dressed as monks with super-extendable arms (see also the classic Kung Fu movie One Armed Boxer vs Master of the Flying Guillotine for a very similar looking monk bitch slapping his opponent from a standing position twenty yards away) which is the only reason us blokes played it in the first place.
Hampton Haze might have been a challenge, but it was a joy as well. Some days smoke blew down the chimneys forcing us to open all the windows. And there was no central heating, which meant we sometimes nearly froze. And rain insisted on coming through the roof, no matter how we tried to stop it. But the house was like a singer with a special song, sometimes hummed, sometimes crooned, sometimes belted out. It had been empty all that time, and now it had an audience and it was happy to be alive. And whatever the weather, whatever our mood, however many challenges we had to face, we couldn’t help but sing along.

Same thing with football. Yes, my boys might get hurt. But I believe that the fun and exercise and enjoyment they get from the game – not to mention the practice of learning to play well with others – exceeds the risk. The odds are extremely good that one of my boys will be hurt in some way while playing football. But the odds are better that any injuries experienced will be minor compared to the benefits they’ll obtain by playing the sport.
The night before making the cake, I baked the cheesecake layer. I used a recipe from Dorie Greenspan's "Baking: From My Home to Yours" for basic tall cheesecake. Since the recipe was for a 9-inch cheesecake, I divided everything by 1/4 since I was only making a 6-inch cake and I didn't want too tall of a cheesecake layer.

The characters of Angel Beats claim that they are in the afterlife and that they are fighting Angel because she is trying to ‘obliterate’ them, which is the only way to leave the world. They do not want to leave, so they fight her. The concept itself is simple but the first episode does a rather poor job of explaining it which can and will leave viewers confused. The videogame analogies actually help very little. This is sadly an anime that is hard to grasp on its first episode and therefore does not deliver a good first impression.

And like any good party there should be good food, wine should flow, the music should be kickass and there should be quality people around. Oh, one more thing, there should also be a betting pool for whether or not Corinthians will come up at the ceremony because you have to find a way to make it through yet another Groundhog Day wedding ceremony.

If it is always smooth sailing, it just meant that the rocky storm hasn’t come yet, not that i am trying to meant it the hard way. It just shows how blessed we are when God is forever there during all the rocky moments and i believe when we have our smooth sailing moments, its him that see us through!
What did he really achieve by sitting in class that long? He did learn some interesting statistics, especially about cell phone usage while driving which has put a stop to my cell phone usage in the car, but honestly, he could have got that information from watching Oprah. As I have taken him out driving, most of his questions come from being behind the wheel, just as mine did when my dad started teaching me to drive at 13. I learned by doing. He now watches me drive with more care and asks questions as I drive too. And just like my dad, we are moving into driving slowly so that he is comfortable and has plenty of time to ask the questions that matter. In the meantime, he has six driving sessions he has to do with his driving school to complete his requirements to get a drivers license at 16. We were informed that it is a good idea to make sure we schedule it at the same time as someone that lives near us otherwise our time will be cut short. Since Alexander doesn't know anyone else taking the class and we are 25 minutes away from the driving school, I imagine that his driving sessions will also be a waste of time only to complete the remaining requirements.
To kick it all off, I'm going to start with a shop-stop. Yeah, you heard me. A blogger who mostely blogs about her wardrobe is going to stop shopping. For two months. Don't worry, I'll keep doing my outfitposts and when I set foot on USA grounds in early July all hell will break loose for my bankaccount. The 20kilo max luggage weight will probably be a partypooper though. Now, I can hear you thinking: Why am I doing this and in what way is it going to make my life more organised? Easy Peasy! Firt off: my wardrobe is a mess. There's tons of old stuff in there, things that I don't wear anymore or desperately need replacement. Secondly, because I feel at a loss when it comes to my personal style. Blogging and seeing all kinds of inspiration has gotten me confused about my own style and even about who am / portray myself to be. During my two month shop-stop I would like to make a plan, moodboards of the styles I really like and think about how I can make them my own. I would like to make a list of basic items I am missing in my wardrobe, such as a trenchcoat, and do a big Spring clean! When this hectic period is over, I would like to be back as a brand new, improved version of myself. Hope you guys are with me :-)

Let us assume that our thieves are competent professionals, and carry out their raid with sufficient skill as to ensure that: a) CCTV footage shows only four medium-build white men in ski masks, arriving and escaping in a stolen car which is later found burnt out three miles from the crime scene; b) no forensic evidence of note is left at the scene; c) the MO of the crime has no particular distinguishing features; d) witness statements provide no clues as to the identity of the perpetrators. This degree of professionalism places the onus squarely on those performing a top-down sweep, who have more luck, being able to ascertain that: a) a British armed robber of note, whom we shall call Mister A, was released from prison in France six months previously and known to be back in the UK; b) the word on the street is that said armed robber had been putting together a crew for some sort of 'job'; c) according to a burglar arrested for an unrelated crime, who knows a man who knows a man, Mister A has already starting dipping his toe in the waters of illegality. On the basis of this information, and having no other leads at all, the police decide to focus on Mister A as the target of the investigation.

Can you believe it? May 1 already. So I sat down this morning and had my normal money date. April was a pretty decent month for me. Despite the fact that I had to shell out $800 on car repairs, I didn’t bat an eye at the huge expense because I was prepared. Ok, maybe there was a slight gulp and sigh involved. Nevertheless I love my little Civic and I haven’t had a car payment in 6 years, so I think the expense was a long time coming.

But sadness won't confine itself to my time
About two weeks ago, Pip dug out from the far end of our bookshelf two children’s biographies that had belonged to me as a kid and had somehow managed to survive all my subsequent moves and book purges. One recounted the life of Thomas Jefferson. The other was about Benjamin Franklin. Re-reading these books for the first time in about two decades, while popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt were toppling dictatorial governments in the background, made me very aware of the almost magical ease with which the transition from revolution to stable democratic governance occurs in America’s founding mythology. This awareness made me question whether this mythology will ultimately do my children a disservice. Will it lead them to expect at an intuitive level that any dramatic break from established patterns will resolve itself neatly and in a way that is universally good? And, as such, will this expectation lead them towards a naive embrace of revolutionary change at the expense of careful and programmatic efforts (such as happened with the Bush-Rumsfeld strategy for creating a democratic Iraq)? My own experience makes me think that this is not a totally ridiculous question.

And if by some bizarre chance such a partial ban came into being, there would be immediate pressure from the neo-Pros to extend it from international brands to national brands, from national to regional, to a total blanket ban.

of money that has been spent on his team. Since Mansour bought the club in 2008 he has ploughed around £1 billion into the club for transfers and wages. Fair enough, it is not Mancini that pays these obscene prices, but he does choose the players (one would assume) and he coaches them. If that much money is being spent on the best players in the world surely the owners would expect more trophies to have been won, especially this seasons Premier League. City were top of the table for most of the season and had built a good advantage over rivals Manchester United, but they blew it and now it is going down to the wire; their team is clearly better and has more depth than United’s, so how have they not won the league with ease?

So we might say that, while architects are busy trying to reimagine traditional building typologies and architectural programs—such as the Library, the Opera House, the Airport, the Private House—these sorts of formally original, though sometimes aesthetically kitsch, designs that we are examining here come not from an architecture firm at all, or from a particular school or department, but from a recreational sports firm pioneering brand new spatial environments.

Enter into the controversy over evolution, he says, rather than pretend it doesn’t exist.

The reason I know this beer was probably better before Sam Adams got hold of it is that in some ways it's pretty darn good even after they did their thing to it. It pours a loosely filtered deep amber that is mostly opaque with a decent tan head. It's not as big as a beer this malty should be and it fades faster than it should, but it's at least there, which is unusual for a Sam Adams beer that's not in a TV commercial.

What is so funny about these dramas.. is there is no sex, no open mouth kissing, no profanity, and no real violence; few people are murdered. But …they keep you interested with the story line and the acting.. and yes they are very funny and the men are amazingly hot. They all have subtitles so I need to read them . but… they are so good you forget you are reading…. and you start feeling for the characters. Most are your … rich guy, poor girl.. fall in love… or rich guy fall in love with poor girl and parents don’t like… or popular boy falls in love with un-popular girl… etc. But even though I am sure I know how they will end… I still must watch it all the way thru.

The gig started when the 50 musicians and choristers walked onstage. Then Jason walked on and took his usual position seated at the stage right. For the next hour they played entirely new material. This makes it difficult to comment because I do not know the names of the songs. Spiritualized songs tend to grow on you, so having so many new songs unleashed on you was a very bold move. I suppose if I wanted a more predictable experience I could go and see Status Quo next year. The first and last song of this part of the concert were very good. There was not the wall of sound or soundscapes in these songs. One of features of Spiritualized are Jason's soft reedy vocals, this was not visible here. His voice was very strong. The musicians and choir exited, and came back for the encore.

You can change money at some restaurants, and there will be guys on the street changing it as well. These options will always give you a slightly lower rate than when you do it at a business type changer. These will advertise that they change money, and their rate will be the bank rate given on any day. If you can, find these places to change money. They’ll give you a receipt so you know you haven’t been taken. One thing someone warned us about with changing money on the street is to really pay attention to how they count it out because certain bills are the same color and it’s easy for them to do it quickly and you miss it. I changed money in all of the available places and didn’t have any problems.

Haymitch at the Reaping falling off-stage (and other Haymitch scenes on the train): The Reaping scene, in my mind, is crucial to two things in the book: first, establishing his character and, to a degree, his relationship with Katniss prior to them even interacting (recall that his drunken pratfall draws attention away from her in a moment of weakness, which is a redirection he is adept at even if not always on purpose); second, establishing a kind of dark humor to the book (Peeta adds to this in various scenes as well), which is overall an element lacking in the film.

Smurfs, the cute, innocent blue creatures that frolic about in the woods, are now under fire from multiple sources claiming that the cartoon is “steeped in Stalinism and Nazism”. The biggest opponent of this cute little cartoon is Antoine Buéno, a French sociologist and the author of the recently published “Le Petit Livre Bleu”, or in English “The Little Blue Book”. In this work, Buéno claims that the Smurfs are filled with racial propaganda and that it is a disgrace that “soils the legends of our childhood”. So what claims does Buéno have against the Smurfs? First, you should know the background of the program and a little about the characters.

Why? Well, first of all, it's a public forum -- people are always reticent to say what they really think in public, and unsure of the reception if they do.

When it comes to improving a passage, it's not really helpful.

human being, and again, I have really appreciated the conversation with him. I appreciate it even more reflecting upon the actual content of that conversation; a conversation that dealt with some of the most important and consequential theological issues that any two men could discuss together. Furthermore, I am very thankful that President Carter was willing to enter in to the public nature of this conversation, and even as he will judge my words, well, inevitably in conversation, we judge each other. And as I evaluate President Carter’s testimony about the scripture, I have to say that it tells a story that desperately needs to be told. A story that is altogether very common in then twentieth century of a young boy who was raised with in the piety and in the warm hearted, evangelical fervor of a Southern Baptist church in the south, but who did not come to a deep understanding of the scripture’s authority in terms of its diving inspiration, its verbal inspiration, and its inerrancy. A young man who was caught up in the twentieth century social transformations and who clearly understood that social change was not only needed, it was a mandate. And one of the issues that happened during the twentieth century is that so many Christians, young Christians who saw deep social ills and signed on to a progressive understanding of politics and social change, also began to attach a progressivist understanding to theology and indeed to the scriptures. And what we see is that in the case of so many Southern Baptists and mainly Protestants of the twentieth century, is that they did basically adopt something like a new orthodox understanding of scripture. And that is where we see the problem in this conversation. And that is where we also see the opportunity that the conversation affords. President Carter was very candid and honest about his understanding of the scripture, and I need to be equally so. I believe that the scripture is the inerrant and infallible Word of God. I believe that God inspired men, yes, and the writers of scripture as scripture says of itself, to write in such a way that they were preserved and protected from all error such that when scripture speaks, God speaks. That puts a constraint upon us that does not allow the kind of selectivity that we could just claim as an interpretive principle. Mr. Carter is a very skilled and very serious interpreter of scripture. He goes to commentaries and he reads, and as he teaches his Sunday school class, he wants to speak of what the text says. But what the text means, can’t be separated from what the text actually states and the divine authority with which the texts speaks. Jimmy Carter is the world’s most famous Sunday school teacher, and in his most recent book and in so many others, he deals with the scripture. And by and large as evangelical Christians, committed to the inerrancy of Scripture would read those comments, they would find tremendous areas of commonality. President Carter mentioned early on in the conversation that even where there are issues in which we indiededly differ, there are vast areas in which we are in agreement. That’s also true, but the issue for us, the difficult issue, is where there is disagreement. Not where there is agreement. And that’s what makes a conversation like this truly important. We are called to be thinking in public. In order to discuss these things in such a way that we speak with great respect and we speak with appreciation for each other, for the appreciation of the opportunity for a conversation about what really matters. What matters not only to us, but to the church of the Lord Jesus Christ. That trajectory that is represented by Jimmy Carter, that trajectory that piotous religion in the south in the twentieth century meets head on with the great theological transformations that came to the end of that century, especially in that second quarter and continue now into the twenty-first century. The issues of Biblical authority and the verbal inspiration of scripture. The issues of human sexuality and the exclusivity of the gospel, of the authority of scripture and the veracity of all that it contains the miracles and everything else. All of these are still live issues, just like the great social and political issues of the twentieth century are still with us, so also are the theological issues, and that is why this conversation is important not only to look to the past, nor even just to think about the present, but to aim to the future. It’s a great challenge and opportunity to speak to a former president of the United States, an 87 year old man who continues to be active in public life and to speak and to write of the things that are most important to

Elderly, firm, and distinguished by his intense bushy brow and beard, thin lips and fiery demeanor. Mr. Stouthart was in fact searching for Ishcandar, his wild and wayward student. Mr. Stouthart had been Ischcandar’s tutor since he was young, and so he knew the lad quite well. “He’s a good upstanding Hobbit, at heart… deep deep deep deep down somewhere inside,” he used to think to himself. Yet, the idea that Ishcandar had landed up on a bar stool was all too familiar a one. Having not found him in such a wise was in fact a bit of a surprise to him.

The cheesecake texture and flavor is going to be very faint for this recipe. This was to allow more of the white chocolate out but by making it this way you don't get a solid ganache on the top, you get something easier to eat and something with a bit of sharpness to the flavor from the cream cheese. You also control the number of calories that a cheesecake can have this way though, of course, the brownie part is it's own calories.

A major influence in that direction was Mike Ashley. Everything I read of his seemed to contain quotes from people who were actually involved and hearing those first person stories — in his history of science fiction magazines, for instance — made the history that much more interesting as you were listening to someone who had actually lived it. Mike's books also had bibliographies and that led me to other books. And lists. I loved lists.

It's annoying when a waiter is slow or snarky, but so what. I'm talking about when one really needs help with a problem--like with France Telecom or other big entities--and the help person is not at all interested in explaining something to you or providing a solution. He wants to tell you that whatever you need is impossible. Why? Well, because he can't think outside the box. It isn't allowed, and he must go by every antiquated and obscure rule. The French don't understand that customer service means you're supposed to help the customer--not compete with her.

The story that came to mind the other night as I thought about our unknown future happened in Kosovo in 1999. The group I was with had left Pristina, Kosovo to travel back to Albania via Macedonia. On our way to the Macedonian border, in the middle of a mountainous route, the van ran out of benzine (gasoline). Prior to this, the gas stations along the route were either closed or ‘unfriendly’ toward outsiders. We pushed it about 1.5 kilometers to the top of the pass, then coasted the next 15km down the winding, mountain road, and then rolled to a stop at the checkpoint. We pushed the van through the checkpoint, past the NATO soldiers from Poland, and then waited on the Macedonian side.

How can we not see that the public acceptance of language like this is tied to the numbers of sexual violations of women? In virtue ethics, we talk about how it is our habits that drive our actions and our choices. The focus is on the type of people we are rather than on specific acts. As we have seen, the type of people who find these sorts of verbal assaults and claims are often the type of people who perpetrate, ignore, or excuse physical assaults. How can they not be? Do we really think there is such a divide between our words and the types of people we are when we act in the world? And those of us who stay silent about the outrageous violation that are such words, those of us who continue to patronize movies by people who are known for this type of language, how are we complicit?

So when GlobalGiving took a look at the situation, we didn’t evaluate our own risks, we evaluated whether we could help these organizations who had committed themselves to heroic deeds. We saw a clear reason for continuing to support them with our fundraising platform. In fact, we accelerated our disbursements and helped them raise awareness of the situation with the public worldwide. This is what big funding agencies should have done, but they lack the agility to design an engagement strategy in the 12-hour window that it takes GlobalGiving.
There are two ways to get to Gaspe: one, is by going around the coast. The second, and most popular route with Gaspesians, is going through the mountains, through Murdockville. Now, the latter is NOT my favorite way. It may be faster, but it's along high, winding roads, the shoulder washed out in places from the rain, and an extremely narrow shoulder at the best of places. Plus, if you do happen to have an accident and go off the side of the road, you have a nice 200 foot drop! Woo hoo! So, being kind to her daughter, my mother agreed to go by the coast.
I busted out laughing before I was even awake.

Torture doesn't even begin to cover it. To this day I cannot adequately describe the anguish I went thru, nor do I want to. There are just no words. I also try not to wonder now what that prolonged hormonal cocktail did to my body in terms of cancer -- I can't go there, I just can't.
Montreal, Quebec. Over 600 brews from over 125 brewers are on hand at Montreal’s massive Mondial de la Biere. Two dozen of Quebec’s brewers are representing at the event that includes limbo competitions, a mini-disk-golf tournament and a dizzying array of food options, like turtle and alligator soup, as well as kangaroo and boar burgers.

A few episodes back, Rebecca followed a lead to figure out who had her son. A sniper took out the person she was speaking to, and he had the shot and could’ve killed her, but didn’t. As a viewer, I chalked it up to the ring leader wanting her alive because he wants something from her. Now, we see that Rebecca had a connection with that sniper when he was a boy. She had the chance to kill him but didn’t. So now, I wonder if he let her live because she didn’t take that shot 15 years ago.
Jane goes the to the secret club to find out what happened to her friend Del as she isn't getting any answers from Del's husband and her other friends. But she goes she ends up having to sleep with another man and that man turns out to be Christian her friend's brother she is relieved as she couldn't go through with it. But she is determined to help Christian to find the missing Del even if she has to pretend to be his lover when she quakes with fear. Her determination helps her overcome it somewhat but she is still disgusted by what she sees. As they delve into the going ons at the club and the attendees, Jane slowly overcomes her fears as Christian shows her a real gentleman and the pleasures that a woman can receive.

I think that there is definitely a possibility of seeing some acoustic songs show up on our myspace, but I don't think it would be something that we put on an album. If we did release some acoustic songs, we would probably just put them up for free download.
Traditional buttermilk: Buttermilk was classically the skim milk left after making butter.

It was acidic, contains probiotics, and was low in fat.

Ok where has the past week gone? It seems in a whirl of appointments, meeting and generally chasing my own non-existent tail! How can it be that I now have children old enough to be (1) sitting GCSEs & thinking about A level choices and (2) choosing GCSE options?? Doesn't seem two minutes since the highlight of our after school time was a reading session with Biff, Chip, Kipper & Floppy and learning times tables. Now there seem to be constant forms to fill in and choices to make that affect the rest of their lives!

So if Iran’s nuclear plant is already destroyed then what reason does the west have to support revolutions and continue to let the media publish information that only encourage more revolutions in Arab countries? Wikileaks has also released cables showing that the GCC were ready to strike Iran and nothing happened. If Iran’s nuclear program is gone and it has been confirmed, then why is the US putting sanctions on Iran and Iran is keeping quiet about their nuclear program being destroyed? This information suggests that the US is in fact cautious of Iran and since Israel wiped out the nuclear program, there shouldnt be any reason to fear a nuclear program in Iran. But the pieces of the puzzle dont quite fit right. If the US knows that the nuclear program in Iran is not a threat then why are they supporting revolutions against their allies? And finally, why exactly is the UN not taking action against the massacre in Syria? Syria is far more powerful than you really think.

Sadly enough, only 20% of salespeople who have been in sales for 10 years and longer fit in the above categories, which means you have little chance of finding them without a highly effective sales hiring system. Oh – you can “win the lottery” and find one in the top 6%, but most companies won’t be able to keep him or her around for very long due to poor sales management and compensation systems.

This is my first real experience with Spanish food, and boy is it wonderful. Very much dependent on a few high quality ingredients and skillful preparation, you don’t see much Spanish food make it to the states. After our meal, we go back to the apartment, and I fall asleep.

We are in the country, more or less, and there are fields and wild woods and marshes all around. I've seen more deer, geese, ducks, and what looks like grouse, then I've ever seen in one place. Well, maybe not the ducks as I've seen some pretty good flocks come in to good ol' San Jacinto. Anywhy, the hunting around here must be fucking insane during the season and, best of all, everything is huge around here. Geese- biggest I've ever seen and loud and gorgeous and amazing. Ducks- I was a drake mallard that looked to be about the size of medium sized dog. He was massive. If the water hadn't been freezing I might have tried to jump in and grab him although he could probably have eaten me. Big duck is what I'm saying. Deer- Big! They're like fucking horses and they're not even showing racks yet. I really want to go hunting in Sweden.

I go out of my way to get to know the kids I teach. I spend time with them at lunch and between classes and after school, and we talk about anything and everything. I notice when they're feeling down, and I ask them what's wrong and if there's anything I can do to help. I give them my home phone number, knowing full well that they could misuse it, but trusting that they won't because they respect me. They respect me because I've learned how to relate to them on their level. I'm not afraid to give a student a pat on the back when they do a good job, or a hug when they need one, or to lend an ear when they need someone to talk to, and I don't worry about what people might think when I do. There's always a certain professional distance there because there has to be, but I go as far as I can to break down the barriers and get to know them within the boundaries of what I feel is appropriate. It's up to me to set those boundaries, and the boundaries need to be flexible, and that all comes down to trust.

Unlike the U.S., Europe's currency... the Euro... is based on the voluntary cooperation of 17 sovereign nations that are trying to be a United States without a central government. The problem is that each of the 17 nations plays by their own rules and each nation has a disparate impact on the common currency. Britain's prime minister is essentially saying to the 17 nations that if they want a central currency, they need a central government... they need to be a United States of Europe.
I've seen it happen before, back when I was b-boying in the '80's. The thing that killed it for us was that we thought we had seen everything. It was the most popular dance around and everybody was doing the same moves. It came to a point where we thought we had taken it as far as it could go, so we moved on. Luckily, it stayed alive in underground circles, with dancers taking influences from places we never would have thought to look, and when I see the b-boys and b-girls of today I am amazed and proud at where the dance has gone. It will be the same with tango when its cycle has run its course. Although I hope the resurgence continues to grow and expand for a good while. There's still plenty of time, and for the general populace tango is still enough of an enigma that there is a lot of untapped potential interest. I still see a healthy insurgence of newbies toddling through their first classes, eyes aground and bodies unmeshed. Actually, that never gets old to me. Witnessing the process of discovery, the aha! moments, is always something that makes me feel really good. Ah, to be a baby again, when everything is new and exciting...

For me this is a four-step process.
The "Giant Impact Hypothesis" neatly ties both observations together. Statement 1 can be true because the orbital debris which formed the Moon came from the Earth and Theia. Statement 2 can be true because the initial angular momentum to establish the Moon's orbit was in line with Theia coming in from elsewhere in the solar system.

Upon walking into the museum, our first reaction was shock. Not at the weird things to see, but at the fact that the building was three stories tall with steep stairs and no public elevator. My friend Jordan and I both had babies and strollers! I asked why they didn’t have an elevator for the public to use and the clerk replied that, “Well, every other person coming in here has a stroller, so it wouldn’t make sense for us to allow people with strollers to use the service elevator.” What? How does that not make sense???? It’s certainly not handicap accessible, let alone accessible for families. Today I carried my stroller—with a 30 lb toddler in it– up multiple flights of stairs. Interesting. If you go to the St. Augustine Ripley’s Believe It Or Not Museum, be forewarned. THERE ARE NO ELEVATORS!!!!!

Worse still, dwindling remittances from migrant workers in South Africa have dealt another blow. The World Bank’s Migration and Remittances Factbook 2011 shows that out of Lesotho’s 2.1 million people, about 457,500 were living outside the country in 2010. As the largest source of foreign exchange, remittances contribute an estimated US$525 million or 30 per cent of Lesotho’s GDP in 2010, says the report.
I was blessed with one of those little episodes yesterday afternoon. I found my schedule slow for the afternoon, so I left the office and went by the grocery store to pick up a few things. I knew in advance of heading to the house that I was going to have to sweep and mop the kitchen because Jake tracked in a stinkin' bunch of mud right before I had to scoot out the door in the morning rush. I just put all three dogs in the kitchen, on tile, until I could get back to the house and clean it up. The knowledge of that chore waiting on me at the house hung over me like a dark cloud.....

It's all very nice and fun and romantic and definitely a pseudo-sciencey to classify yourself as right-brained or left-brained. Left-brainers are the orderly, punctual, compunctual, math fiendish, disciplined types. Right-brainers are the wacky, creative, disorganized, idea-a-minute types (basically, they're what hipsters would like to be).

Although I still see Jeremy Brett as the ideal performer to portray Conan Doyle’s original Holmes--which he did so well in Granada Television’s 1984-1994 adaptations of the Holmes yarns--I’ve developed substantial appreciation for Cumberbatch’s re-interpretation of the character. And Freeman’s Watson is a particularly brilliant foil, his friendship with the Great Detective growing despite the latter’s oft-uttered indifference to such relationships.

As local newspapers are losing more and more readers, it's my belief they need to focus more on the talents in the community, and not just by listing where and when a specific person is having a reading, etc. Tell them about the book. Let the readers tell us about a book they read. Get everyone involved. Frankly, I don't see the difference between a local author who publishes via a University Press and/or a small publishing company who sells a handful of "real" books, versus a self-published independent author who may even sell more books on-line than either of those. It's the story that matters, not the ISBN number, or if a book is in a brick and mortar store. The times, they are a changing, and newspapers need to change with them.

I was advised to take kelp (containing iodine) when I was diagnosed as being hypothyroid. That is my thyroid gland wasn't working well and when it's a lazy little thing then the person sharing the body with it is a lazy little thing also. I didn't mean to be lazy - I just couldn't help it. The gland running my metabolism was a bit slow. So I started taking kelp, and, finally, finally began losing weight. OK, the exercise, taking loads more fruit and vegetables in and watching my portions of dinner didn't hurt either.

An even more important but related problem than the bankruptcy of Manhattan Plaza that was facing the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood and the theater district was the rapid spread of pornographic theaters, peep shows, and male and female prostitutes on the streets along eighth and ninth avenues. In fact once the arrangement was made for Section 8 subsidies for Manhattan Plaza, the area along 42nd Street between 8th and 10th Avenue had deteriorated to such an extent that there was still a serious question as to whether anyone would live there even with deep subsidies in a luxury building. Eight the Avenue was so infested with aggressive prostitutes that increasing numbers of theater patrons from the suburbs and out of town become reluctant to go to the Broadway theater and there arose a serious question as to whether the Broadway theater could survive.

This, ladies and gentlemen, was how my mother and I began the journey of kaya making more than 20 years ago, while I was still in school. My late father loved the stuff. In between his slices of bread or toast, he could do without butter or margarine, but at least half an inch of kaya had better be there. And it better be sweet. As always, Dad liked to make his own thing if he could. He started the whole homemade kaya business but failed on the first attempt. After that, Mum and I got interested.

Kino’s new offering makes me wonder if I knew what ‘it’ really meant. Murnau’s approved score is no dirge, at least most of the time; it’s punctuated with xylophones and up-tempo percussion flourishes throughout, even moving into pure romantic melodies when main characters Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) and Ellen (Greta Schröder) express their love. And why not? Von Wangenheim’s hero is no tragic victim—he’s a total clod; a man whose boundless enthusiasm rests on his inability to see what’s coming. Hutter is a real estate agent working for impish weirdo, Knock (Alexander Granach). When Knock tells him he’s to travel to the Carpathians to sell ‘Count Orlock’ a house—the house next to Hutter’s, no less—the young man barely manages a frown. He returns home to Ellen, his wife, and tells her (with a wide grin): “I must travel far, far away, to the land of thieves and phantoms.”

‘Out of the game’ entails a couple of songs that have within-family talks. Montauk –where we have the piano the most-, is a very interesting piece, where Rufus talks to his daughter Viva, whose mother is Leonard Cohen’s daughter Lorca Cohen, saying ‘One day you will come to Montauk and see your dad trying to be funny and see your other dad seeing through me’. And that ‘other dad’ is Rufus’ partner Jorn Weisbrodt, who is chosen as a Deputy Dad for Viva. Rufus and his lifelong close friend Lorca Cohen chose to bring a child to world – Viva Katherine Wainwright Cohen born in 2011 –, a child that may well please both Cohen’s and Rufus’ fans one day, also a child that may on the other hand feel too much pressure from this extraordinary genetic musical heritage.

"He said, ‘When they decide whether they're going to accept you to SCHS, they're probably going to ask me what you were like in summer school. And I'm going to have to be honest. So, it's really up to you.' No drama. No judgments. Just an honest assessment that empowered me to decide my own future," wrote Alan, who credits Mr. D'Aquila for helping him boost his math SAT score enough to get accepted into the University of Connecticut. Alan graduated, went on to get a law degree, and now heads his own company in New York City that consults with interactive media companies on public policy issues.

Although the TDF has changed over the years, it’s still the best cycling race on the planet with all manner of thrills, spills, and chills, and this year has proved no exception. Of our original 15 man team, we lost 4 riders (Horner, Wiggins, Van De Walle, Louder) in the first 8 days, mostly to injury crashes. And the Tour has lost overall many of the podium-favored national road race champions. That’s pretty unheard of.

Calgary’s winter maintenance program of its bike trails along the river system extends the cycling-shopping right through winter as bike trails are cleaned of snow with the same priority as streets and only the minus 15 to minus 30 degree C weather provides the hurdle to overcome. Combining cycling and the C-Train rapid transit system makes such shopping trips more comfortable as total cycling distance can be managed to prevailing conditions.

Hey everyone, I hope you all are gearing up for the upcoming holidays and didn't have too hectic of a Black Friday shopping spree (I was almost run over by women fighting over discounted scrap booking supplies; ah the perils of being an artist). I thought I'd introduce one of the myriad of goals behind this blog of mine; to occasionally post a WIP (Work In Progress) so you can see how a drawing evolves.

Recently my mom retired from 25+ years as a church secretary. She has a gift for words and often used the church newsletter to express her thanks in a space called “Thankful Corner”. Now that she’s retired, I thought I’d use this space to carry on the sentiments.
“You know, I never really identified as an artist. That was my mom’s thing-she was the artist. But growing up surrounded by artistic people and handmade things, I acquired a love for art and a sense of importance about it. I just love fabric and fibers so much and as I’ve begun and continued my work with them, I’ve found myself wondering, “What am I, besides mommy?” I finally decided, “Ok, I’m an artist.”
In one recent project in Benin, West Africa, SELF created the world’s first solar-powered combination water pump and drip irrigation system to increase food security. Essentially no food grew in the area during the dry season, so a solution had to ensure a steady supply during those months. The solar-powered system has dramatically increased the region’s supply: Now, 20% of food produced is consumed, and 80% is sold to market.

Place the rhubarb, sugar, and water in a medium saucepan. Split the vanilla bean, scrape the soft, pulpy seeds into the pan, and toss in the pod. Bring to a simmer over low heat, and cook, stirring often, until the rhubarb softens and almost seems to melt. The cooking time will depend on the rhubarb, but it probably won't be more than 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, retrieve the vanilla bean and discard (or save, rinse, dry, and use to flavor sugar). If using the candied ginger, eliminate the vanilla bean.

Winston Heywood - Long Long Time
Dear Debby,
I tend to be a realist, so these random acts of kindness really restore my faith in humanity. It's people like Amy who inspire me to pay it forward—a lesson I learned early on as a college student volunteering at the local animal rescue league. As a young 20-something, I became a volunteer tutor for the local adult literacy center. One of my students, a dear lady named Lupe, even came to my wedding.
Quite how this will all be resolved and pan out, remains to be seen. That Salviani did not see this coming as early as some of the comments posted to this site (and here) over the past few months and the general correspondence I received, still puzzles me. It has been apparent since before Christmas 2009 that things were pretty stretched at Raider and the centre core had to give at some stage.

I, personally, would find it very difficult to write Cinderella's story the way I set her up in this example. I would have to give her a much more compelling reason for going to the ball and far greater opposition to keep her from getting there. On the other hand, I could write the stepmother's story in a heartbeat. Already, I'm wondering what made her the way she is, what makes her love her unworthy daughters so deeply, and whether her conscience will let her find redemption in the end. I feel the need to know, and the outcome isn't clear to me. There's room for her to change what she wants, to get what she wants and find it bitter, to fail and be happy to have done so. THAT provides room for tension and reader engagement.
My obsession is NOT coming to an end. I will try to find a way to carry on my LOSTNESS (and the blog of course), as long as there are LOST topics to write about. Who knows...maybe there's a book in my future. lol
Looking forward to the hop next week!
Psalm 34:4-5 I sought the Lord, and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears. Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame.

Brian regularly behave with an oddly uncharacteristically pompous and arrogant attitude. You will also see him actively brag about his many past roles and achievements in a manner which definitely does not fit with his trademark humility.
Oh and if you thought the term hipster (don't call them that!!!) was something that went out with 1970s, think again. If you don't know what a hipster is, read the short "send-up" below of what they stand for (taken from the Hipster Handbook), and know that every cool kid you know who wears nerdy glasses and a funny moustache secretly, or sort of secretly identifies as one. For the record, if I were 24 again I would probably be part of this social group who have become extremely influential during the recession. In fact, I would be so bold as to say that the talented among this generation are this decades next creative, fashion and maybe even intelligentsia A-list.

The only modern equivalent of this virginity test I’ve heard of is the one proposed by Vladimir Rakovsky, a Russian psychologist who runs a charm school in Moscow. According to Rakovsky, you can find out everything you need to know about a woman by watching her eat a carrot. If she blushes and nibbles, she’s a virgin; if she chews like a horse, she’s a fishwife; if she sucks before biting, she’s slept with every member of the village council. He didn’t say what kind of woman would refuse to eat the carrot. A lesbian or a prick-teaser, perhaps? In all honesty, the test sounds as if was devised by someone who spent his youth peeping at hefty farm girls during their lunch break.
My aunt recently gave me a photo album and loose pictures belonging to her parents, Stephen Popp (Stefan Papp) and Anna Pereksta. Most of the images are of friends of the family from the Binghamton, NY area. Most are from the 1910s and 1920s. All seem to have been taken in the United States. Over the next months I will digitize and post the images and any cursory research I have done under the title My Carpatho-Rusyn FAN Club.

Later, probably because John Smeaton, the designer was from my home town, I learned of the very different nature of offshore lights, perched on rock, and needing to withstand the roughest seas, and how, in 1696, Henry Winstanley resolved to put a light on the deadly Eddystone Rock, 14 miles offshore in the English channel. Only a few years later, in the Great Storm of 1703, it was swept away in a storm, and Winstanley with it.

Feeling as apprehensive as a mother sending her child off for the first day of school in a strange land, I waved goodbye to Candy and wished her luck. I really shouldn't have worried though because it wasn't long before she reappeared with...you guessed it...the horse! It turns out that UPS will only ship something after it has been packed. They will not wrap it and box it for you. Neither will Fed Ex. But do you think that the UPS agent could have told Candy before she was forced to hold the horse high above her head to make room for the cheek-to-cheek crowds on the bus during rush hour? No way! The good news is that Candy discovered the key to making Parisians smile. Paper mache horse, anyone?
And Romanticism? Its music still has the strongest appeal to audiences for classical music - not all, of course, but a distinct majority. You want "popular classics"? You get Tchaikovsky. So it is not dead. Twisted, certainly, but defunct, not at all. Most of us still, somewhere, believe in the redemptive power of love - don't we? - and the current craze for vampire movies suggests that maybe we even want to believe, at some level, in the supernatural. But the destruction of a soul through lack of love, and that lack of love, and tenderness, and compassion, and kindness, and idealism, as a comment on our society, is taking hold. Maybe we should take notice.

It is slightly more complicated than that, but not in a way that matters here. No kicks on the dancefloor, please. Thank you. And now we know for sure: this is a shit class for gullible tourists.

Today is my errands day before I go back to work tomorrow, so I didn't go on any photo safaris. But there were two shots from yesterday that didn't fit in the photo essay easily, so I played with them to create b&w shots.
If you are just starting this phase, still in this phase, getting out of this phase, you gotta know it’s totally normal and the most important, possible thing you can do is do a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week or every month you know you will finish one story. You create the deadline. It’s best if you have someone waiting for the work, even if it’s somebody that doesn’t pay you. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions.

Though albums are sold as CDs or digital tracklists these days, rather than tapes or records with two sides, there are certain features of the first half of an album's playing time, and certain features of the second half, that have held true even after we stopped having to flip over our tapes and records. This post is about what works on side one of an album.
In Glasgow, for the very first time, it felt like we were in a different country. London feels like Sydney, nothing different. In Glasgow, I have trouble understanding people and they have trouble understanding my accent. The buildings are different and the street layout more fan-like, less chris-cross. I had my first Burger King in the UK (not bad, lots of chips, smaller burger, sharp mayo) and it was cold.
As a child, I was taught "necessity is the mother of invention." Do you have a need that isn't being met? Create the solution! In law school, that lesson refocuses. Copyright protections (and patents) encourage creations; no one would create new ideas if they could be copied by others with no compensation. Right?
The results of the scan show that right now baby looks normal...which is great right? right...it's great! it is really. I get so emotional every time I see that baby moving around being alive. The sonographer also gave me a 3D picture of the baby which I guess is totally hush hush but she said "considering your history, and your husband can't be here...." I have never seen any of my babies in 3D...I expressed my gratitude, and no offense to anyone who is into those, but I find them somewhat creepy.

I grew more than I expected over the course of the program. There were moments when I hated it and many moments where I was burned out and thought about quitting. There were many other moments when I realized what I was doing and realized what incredible potential there was for personal growth and later helping people grow…and then I liked it again. I found the program to be immensely useful and practical; I come away with many good counseling tools.

Christmas Day - I know they say pictures don't lie, but I got a heap of compliments from my in-law side of the family on this outfit (my Mum and my Dad hate me wearing black, so no surprise on the lack of compliments there!).

Two collaborations with Tricky--the sensuous tone-and-texture poem "Headphones" and the shatteringly intense "Enjoy" were recorded in the totally un-tropical climate of Iceland. "They were like rough demos," says Tricky, who later dated Bjork. "I kept waiting for her to say 'let's take them to an expensive studio'. But Bjork had the courage to release the songs as they were, and that still shocks me. She ain't scared of nothing." Of their first meeting, Tricky says "I fancied her straight away. The idea of us collaborating as artists wasn't even discussed, it was sort of already known. I thought she was mad cute, but didn't think anything would come of it-it was like she was on a different planet to me, a superstar."
Well here it is April, and April Fools day at that. It also happens to be my 20 something wedding anniversary!

But how to get there if I couldn’t see? And what to do with my kids while I was at the doctor? I needed help. The quickest way for me to get help is to put out an APB on Facebook. I thought against it for a minute knowing I would worry some people who are geographically unable to help. My husband included. He knows how much I hate doctors, so putting out a request for someone to take me to the doctor would catch his interest. But I could put up one status and find out who was available, or I could start calling. I went for the easiest route first. Sure enough moments after posting I got a call from the other side of the world to see if I was okay. And my wonderful friends in Alaska didn’t fail, while I was one the phone with him, a friend was calling to offer her services. Can I say here that this was hard for me? I’ll admit that one thing I like best about my eyesight it that I know how important it is for independence. I would have to rely on others. And today was yet another day during this deployment where I couldn’t take care of life all by myself. I was crying as I wrote the post on Facebook. Although, I was in so much pain I was crying before I wrote it was well, but while writing a few tears were shed because I had to ask for help. Not something I ever do well.

What we hinge about is sailing, racing, promoting sailing, teaching sailing, having a great youth sailing/racing program, cruising the general area and did I mentioned sailing already?! Our Thursday night racing series goes from daylight savings start to finish (or thereabouts). Every Thursday night we have 5 starts for different classes from centerboard (where I enroll my Laser every week) with Lasers, Windmills, Flying Scots, Fireball, Snipe, etc. to Spin “A” with J120, J109, J35, etc. Yeah, we also have non-spin A & B, racer-cruiser, J24-Melges 24 starts, etc. Every night 30 to 50 racing sailboats on the water. An all volunteer race committee takes turns serving or racing, four co-captains share the responsibility, all racers take turns serving as race committee. On Thursday nights, we are open to the community, dinner and drink tickets. Around 300 or more folks visit our facilities to participate in the races. The truest lung for the city of Tampa and surrounding areas.

I’m semi-inspired to check out another film based off of Woodrell’s book Woe to the Devil, if only to see the casting spectacle that includes Skeet Ulrich, Tobey Maguire (blech), and…Jewel?? Seems a little cheeseball, based on the trailer. Probably a scenario of book trumping movie, as is so woefully often the case. Would love to know if anyone has seen it and if it’s worth a view…
I forgot to add that they hooked me up to a fluid bag. So I had extra fluid running into me. And if your pregnant you know what that means. This made it a hundred times worse. Because it was constant liquid flowing into my body. So I had to get up to go pee every 2-5 min! Im not exaggerating!
The launch was a public event, had been well-publicised, and was held in a packed lecture theatre at the Institute Cervantes. Even the steps were full. The Chair of EUNIC Greece, Eusebi Ayensa Prat, Director of the Instituto Cervantes de Atenas, welcomed everyone, and Maria Stratigaki, General Secretary for Gender Equality, made opening remarks. The discussion was chaired and facilitated by journalist Mary Adamopoulou from the newspaper Ta Nea.
Several of the artists were drawn to the issue of race. Sculptor Meredith Bergmann cast an eye toward the Brooklyn Historical Society’s building itself, questioning the practice of solely commemorating white men in our civic spaces. The beautiful 1881 building is ornamented with terracotta busts of male European historical figures, such as Columbus, Shakespeare and Michelangelo, accented with indigenous American plants, such as corn.

Well, I guess that's not as much of an excerpt as I had thought, but I loved, absolutely loved her thoughts on Lent. Tradition states we should give up one thing for Lent, but why? How does that affect others? But the idea of serving others, that's beautiful. God calls us to be a light in the world, to be Jesus to the world. And Jesus called us to serve. He did. He washed His disciple's feet. He fed the hungry. He cured the sick and brought the dead back to life. He didn't just teach, He served. He made sure his actions spoke of who He was as much as His words did.
Wash meat and add to boiling water, skin, bones and all. Cook until falling off the bone. Lately we have been puttng the pot into the oven and letting it cook slowly overnight. The beef tendons should be very soft and signifcantly smaller. Take meat out of pot and chop when cool enough to handle. Strain and save liquid. Discard all bones as cook bones are brittle, often break into shards, and can cut up your dog's digestive system. Add cut up meat back into pot.

Traditionally, mistletoe can be kept over the doorways in the house either until Candlemas, when the last of the Christmas greenery is traditionally taken down, or can remain in the house year round. The mistletoe is supposed to also help ward off lightning strikes and fires for the house, bring good fortune, and--naturally--help bring babies to the house. However, if you keep mistletoe up all year, you should take it down on Christmas Eve and replace it with a new sprig. This helps re-up the good luck and fertility invocation of the plant.

Nolan and Glorin immediately engage the vampire before he can retreat back to his companions while Shara and Tayin pelt Malvora with arrows and spells respectively. Magnus uses one of his hold undead scrolls on the vampire, hoping to replicate his previous success against Lucan, unfortunately there is no effect. Jack takes a gamble at this point...not only was he suspicious of Keldor's identity but he had an intuition after the first battle that they were not actually fighting a vampire at all (just goes to show that you should be careful pulling tricks when playing with your significant other, NJ saw right through me). So he uses his last remaining Phantasmal Killer spell (damn sorcerers) against the vampire. Although he fails to kill the Claw leader outright the spell definitely causes a reaction as he screeches in fear and leaps backwards from the horrific vision...clearly proving himself not undead.
This recipe is another Bon Appetit find that I had dog-eared for later. I love Chermoula, another Moroccan dish, so I was sure that Chicken Tagine would be right up my alley. I did make several modifications from the original recipe. Nick hates olives, so I swapped in onion for them. I also added wild rice to the plating of this, as we usually try to pair dinners with a starch, but it can be easily left out, so that the final product is more of a stew.
In my experience, most of the delays in responding to MPs’ correspondence is due to the challenge of finding which is the correct department, division and policy team to handle the specific piece of correspondence. I have wandered many-a-mile in the Whitehall jungle to try and find who is best placed to respond to MPs’ correspondence. I never liked chucking stuff back at the system for some other poor soul to deal with the issue – every extra day stuck in the correspondence system was one less day for the policy team to research a decent response.

Very cutesy:
Overall, I have to remember that a mystery, though plotted carefully, is not an algorithm. In my experience, writing the required outline can strip away the moment-to-moment surprises like nothing else. Can you really write well if you’re burdened by some formula? If a = suspects, b = complications, c = corpse and d = detective, do you add blind alleys and red herrings, and divide by y (means, motive and opportunity) in order to find x (the culprit). Or does that just make it stale?
I write:
Of this increase, 84% (£380) was unrelated to low-carbon measures and was down to increases in the wholesale price of gas, escalating transmission and distribution costs and VAT. The CCC said that “around” £75 (16%) of the increase in bills was due to policies that reduce carbon emissions.
Whether we want to acknowledge it or not, we are a compilation of every experience we have ever had. Our beliefs, our desires, our thoughts, our actions – whether we would choose them again, whether we are ashamed of them or are proud of them – are the building blocks of what we have chosen to learn and experience. There is no right or wrong. With the vision of this reality, our understanding of all the reasons and factors that caused us to make our choices is limited. But, once we embark on a path, our disposition is to continue with it in one form or another until the chosen lesson is learned and the experience is complete. This may take lifetimes.

The house was quiet, it was an eerie stillness that I only had whenever I was alone. I took comfort in it as it embraced me and as that unmistakable smell of coffee surrounded me. I sat for a second to enjoy it, but just a second and then I had to get up and begin my chores for the day so I can get them all done before Jack got home.
With the new lawsuit, Apple is opening up another legal assault on the South Korea-based company after taking Samsung to the same court in April of last year. In the earlier case, Apple alleged that Samsung illegally copied iPhone and iPad design features and the look of its screen icons. That case is still going on, although in December Apple lost a bid for a preliminary bar against Samsung for selling Galaxy phones and tablets.

Always use a password—it’s amazing how many accounts have blank passwords. And choose a complex one. Don’t use your dog’s name, your anniversary date, or the name of the local football team. And don’t use the word “password”! Pick a password that has a mix of upper- and lower-case letters, number, punctuation marks, and so forth. Make it as long as possible. And change it often. Once you’ve picked a strong password, handle it appropriately. Don’t write it down. If you absolutely must write it down, at the very least keep it in a safe or a locked drawer—the first thing a bad guy who’s hunting for passwords will do is check for a yellow sticky note on the side of your screen, or in the top desk drawer. Don’t tell anyone what your password is. Remember what Ben Franklin said: two people can keep a secret, but only if one of them is dead.

When my friend signed the two of us up for the workshop, I was more than a little intimidated. I thought it was a bit above my skill level. I thought 3 weeks was not nearly long enough (even though we have access to the material for 3 months, it's still only 3 weeks of new lessons.) I saw her art before taking this workshop, thinking to myself, "There is just NO WAY that in 3 short weeks, she is going to be able to teach ME how to do THAT."

The service warranty I got for him doesn’t cover physical damage, and it’ll cost around $300.00 to get it fixed (Which means I might as well buy a new one.)

“A R10 000 reward has been offered to anyone who identifies the racist scum who marred Saturday’s Springbok victory at Johannesburg’s Ellis Park.” It was an opening paragraph designed to attract attention and it certainly caught mine.

I had been sipping on one of the many cocktails created by famous Sasha Petraske (of Milk and Honey). I cannot remember what it’s called and of course it’s not on the website or any menu I can find so it must be a very new addition. I can tell you it had cucumber, lime and tequila among other things. I really liked how the cucumbers added a fresh clean taste to the drink and it wasn’t overly sweet either.

The expectations for this film are great on my part, but not without reason. A decade and a half ago, anticipating any Korean film to be as good as or above any Hollywood creation would have been laughable. But since the early 2000s, South Korea has proven itself a growing cinematic force to watch — what film lover around the world hasn’t seen “Oldboy”?

Let’s carry that out as it relates to God. If God were only merciful (not giving us what we deserve), He’d be nothing but a heavenly softy, and all of us errant “children” (from you to Hitler) would be getting off the hook scott free. Nothing would ever be corrected, justice would never be done. All the sin throughout all of history would be swept under the rug and eternally ignored. Everyone gets amnesty. There is never any “reckoning.” In my thinking, that would be “mercy gone wild,” and it wouldn’t be good.
I don’t say the Pledge of Allegiance, although I can sing the national anthem. I now know what a “do-over” and a “Hail Mary pass” and “step up to the plate” mean — all these sports references!

Our children are growing up in a selfish world where they need to be entertained every second. Relationships tend to get lost in the pace of their (our) lives. I am trying, in small ways surely, to teach them that it's not about them. It is not an easy thing to do, but I hope today it opened up a little window for them to see what they are missing right in front of them.

Back to the book in question. Our hero is a young lad who has a blood clot in his eye which makes people fear him - we know little of his background since he himself does not having a memory only back a couple of years when he was taken in by a carpenter in a village on the southern coast of Wessex. He is the carpenters help but his life is shattered when Norsemen arrive in longships ostensibly to trade with his fellow villagers. He discovers to his amazement that he can understand their language. There is treachery and he ends up with the band of Vikings leaving behind the village.

A few days ago, NPR (National Propaganda Public Radio) aired a typically laudatory piece on the novel, voiced by reporter Lynn Neary. As usual on the soothing, soporific NPR, this piece was filtered through, and aimed toward, a well-educated white perspective. These implied people are all too happy to be reminded that racism is a thing of the past, and that things are oh so much better now. The writers of this NPR segment were careful enough to interview some black teachers and students about Lee's book, but if any offered significant criticism, their perspectives were left out.

Paper by Gina K Designs
As a Catholic (my friend is also Catholic), I approach pain and suffering as an opportunity to be united with Christ. Through His Passion, He gave meaning to suffering, and we can unite our suffering to His, so that our suffering takes on meaning and becomes redemptive. It strikes me as bad form, however, to try to point this out to someone as they are experiencing the pain. The connection should be established before the suffering is entered into. The admonition to “offer it up” is not well received unless the soul has been properly prepared.
A good example that makes this point is the case of my own 13-year-old Dalmatian, Henry. Soon after moving to a new home, we noticed that Henry began to itch like mad and lick at his lower back and tail area. A surprisingly short time later, Henry had an angry red patch of bare skin that he refused to leave alone.

Now, if you’re not residing under a rock, then you’re very familiar with the ongoing conversations about sugar and it’s negative impact on the body. I’ve learned about this in detail while taking my nutrition class last semester, and let me just say, they’re “sugar coating” it in the news. Large amounts of sugar has negative impacts on not just your physical health (allergies, cancer, digestive abnormalities, head aches, skin discolorations, chronic vaginal infections, etc.) but also your mental health, and it’s a factor in one of the reason why a plethora of Americans are consuming psychiatric drugs for mental ailments (i.e. anxiety, depression, bipolar, etc.). I’ve listened to a variety of speeches from notable scientists, and one of my favorites is by Robert H. Lustig, MD. If you get a chance, listen to his forum called Sugar: The Bitter Truth.

When I traveled on the art show circuit, many of my customers would stand for long periods of time reading the stories I had attached to each sculpture. Some of the stories brought tears to their eyes; others, smiles of knowing to their faces. At the prompting of those customers – "We can't afford to buy all your sculpture to get the stories" – I decided to self-publish She Who Whispers. But I needed the expertise to pull it all together. A book called "How to Publish Your Own Book," by Dan Poyntner, showed me the way. I highly recommend it. This book removed any reservations I had about self-publishing: I was so excited. That was in 1990 and She Who Whispers is still selling extremely well.

In these examples, I may not be describing you and your relationship with your children. But I am describing real adults and their real relationships with their real children - I mean, it happens, it really does. And the saddest part is that our children, these children, see their parents as the ultimate model, and teacher, and authority in their lives, and they can grow up with a sense that the parenting they experience every day is the way parenting is supposed to be. And so they come to expect such behavior in their own parents, and in other parents - and so they stand a reasonable chance of becoming such parents themselves.

So we jumped right in and took the classes. We came to the last meeting and listened to those people on the panel who shared their experiences and helped us understand the flow and processes of the foster care system. We got finger printed. We had our worker come to our home for an initial home visit, and she scheduled another one for a couple of weeks after the final class. In that first visit she asked us to remind her what ages we were wishing for/ willing to take. We told her that we would love to have a baby or very young children. We were also interested in sibling groups if that young child happened to have a sibling or two, perhaps up to age seven or so? She made careful notes, and then promised to call us with something totally different! We laughed… she wasn’t kidding. She also asked about other things such as what races we were willing to take, etc. We mentioned that we would really love to have a child/family with a Hispanic background, especially since my hubby is Hispanic and speaks the language fluently. She noted that as well, but told us that Hispanic children didn’t come into care very often because there is usually a relative available. She took our information for background checks and for references, and then all we were left with was preparing our home – the rest was up to our worker.

For the last seven years we have used what I call a “push” model and it has proven ineffective because it is the embodiment of 20th century learning. 20th Century learning is all about “pushing” information at a group of passive recipients.

Many on the internet have tried to duplicate the Loveless biscuit recipe, and I tried some of their attempts, but they all came up flat. After much research and watching many youtube videos of Carol Faye in her various TV appearances, I determined that the Loveless Cafe biscuits had to be a specific variant of a Southern style biscuit called an "angel biscuit" which have yeast in them and Carol Faye always had to give time to rise. This type of biscuit was also called a "bridal biscuit" because it had 3 kinds of leavening in them yeast, baking soda, and Southern soft wheat self-rising flour - it gave new brides extra insurance that their biscuits would come out light and airy. I tried many recipes of this style biscuit, but the one that led me on the right track was out of the Southern Foodways Alliance Community Cookbook﻿, which I really need to own someday. I tweaked it to make it more like the Loveless - the biscuits are smaller and saltier and are much taller than in the cookbook. From my research, it looks like Carol Faye uses oil instead of shortening, but I always have shortening on hand so that's what I use. At the Loveless, biscuits are cut small - Carol Faye said in an interview that she used to use a tomato paste can to cut out her biscuits, so I use a shotglass to cut out mine.
Black universe is the term of this ‘miraculous means’, the secret of secret through which, like blackness in black, the revealed and the hidden, the given and the foreclosed intimately open to each across impassible distance. On the one hand the secret of secret is the abysmal hiddenness or absolute foreclose that secret reveals, as shown in Francis of Assisi’s hesitant disclosure of his seraphic vision, which only unveils a more secret secret: “Although the holy man used to say on other occasions: “My secret is for myself,” he was moved by Illuminato’s words. Then, with much fear, he recounted the vision in detail, adding that the one who had appeared to him had told him some things which he

NATIONAL ACADEMY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION TO CALL FOR THE CORPORATIZATION OF THE USPTO: In a report summary being circulated by NAPA, a recommendation is being floated to reorganize the USPTO as a federal corporation. The idea behind the reorganization is to insulate the USPTO against fee diversion (which is always a good idea), and to set the USPTO loose in establishing its own performance milestones.

Forgiveness, on the other hand, as it’s usually defined, is about judgment, and that’s what’s wrong with it. The forgiveness set-up puts you in the judge’s black robes and wig, and gives you the power to to pardon the defendant if he admits guilt and says he’s sorry. But in real life there is no remand, and there is liable to be a lot of waiting time on the bench, during which you—the potential forgiver—are much more imprisoned than the wrongdoer, who has often moved on already, and not in a good way.
A couple of weeks back I was away in Bundoran for my brother-in-law's stag party. A group of his friends are as much my wife's friends as his, so I know them pretty well at this stage and get on most chummily with them. One of the lads, Kevin, who is also soon to be married, was laughing at the fact that his bride-to-be had, at one stage or another, snogged several of his mates. He doesn't care, this was long before his time and such things inevitably happen between any group of intergender mates. Then he looked mischievously at me and, expecting to get a rise out of me, said "But do you know which of the lads has snogged Rosie?"

Once the event moved into the theater for the opening night films, I was relieved of my intern duties and joined Nav in the theater audience. One of the first things Jesse Harris, the founder of NFFTY, did was have all the screening filmmakers stand up for recognition. That was a chilling but incredible feeling for me to stand up with 220 other young filmmakers from around the country and around the world. It’s like wow, these young filmmakers from near and far have worked their asses off following their passion of filmmaking and they are finally getting they’re night and weekend of fame. They have the satisfaction and pride of getting to work, toil and sweat over their project, their baby, and then have it play center stage in front one of the most prominent filmmaking communities in Seattle and the world. And I, me, Eric Schofhauser, actually get to take part in that, not only as an intern, but as a screening filmmaker, albeit, my film is pitiful in comparison to the caliber of the others screening, it was an incredible feeling standing there with everyone else as the audience applauded us. Around me, standing, was the future of film, and that was an incredibly powerful and inspiring experience.

It occurs to me that snowmobiling is much like my spiritual life. Occasionally I drive, and it's me setting our course, weaving through the trees, getting us hopelessly lost. But when God takes the "wheel" and I hang on, trusting Him for the speed and destination, I see the scenery. I trust him to keep me safe. I trust him to bring me home, where there is an eternal supply of hot chocolate.
At my follow-up visit with Wonder Doc the next week, I watched him enter the exam room with his “I don’t really wanna tell her this” face and knew that my complaints of ouchies hadn’t been for naught. Sure enough, the results of the CT scan showed that there has, indeed, been more growth in both my Alien and its partner in crime. The Gemzar (at several thousand dollars a pop) doesn’t appear to be doing its thing. At least not on our new flight plan. So, Wonder Doc was proposing a switch to a new drug called Doxil (doxorubicin lipid compound) that’s administered only once a month. Now, I don’t know about y’all, but … chemo that’s administered only once a month sounds mighty damned strong to me. So, with my usual mental and verbal dexterity, I proposed an alternative — “um, Doc … we never tried 2 weeks on/1 week off with the Gemzar. Wanna give that a try first?” And, lo and behold, he agreed to try it.

When you choose to travel depends on your purpose for visiting... If sightseeing is your main game then I would suggest April, May... September or October. The weather is usually fabulous and the crowds haven't peaked. If lavender and sunflowers are a must then July must be braved. If you want to rent a property with friends and do nothing but relax, then the summer months of July and August are about as lazy as you could imagine. The only downside... crowds... Provence is popular for a reason... and seeing and doing what you have planned will have to be shared with many others. The markets are crowded and the sites are jam packed... but if you can deal with the multitudes then the atmosphere makes up for that. Winter in Provence is less ideal as many places are closed for their annual break, although Christmas and New year are very festive. Provence is very much about the seasons so I am afraid you must choose... or return for frequent visits. But be warned... that's what happened to me...

Wisconsin's brewery history began thirteen years before Wisconsin became a state and a year before it became a territory. By the late 1890s, when dairy cows began grazing in Wisconsin fields and dairy barns began gracing the rural countryside, nearly every Wisconsin community already had an operating brewery. Wisconsin was a beer state long before it became known as America's dairyland (p. xiv).

Rajoy probably will face further unrest if he’s forced to implement more budget cuts to meet ambitious deficit goals. His government has now pledged to reduce the shortfall to 5.3 percent of GDP in 2012 from 8.5 percent in 2011 and by more than 2 percentage points next year to get within the EU’s 3 percent limit. Despite a raft of austerity last year, the country achieved a deficit reduction of less than 1 percentage point.

Yesterday was a sick day for me, and I worked from home. So I expected to hit you with a double-whammy of recipe posts. But instead, I ended up sleeping most of the time I wasn’t working or feeling like I was dying, so, alas, no recipe posts. I’ll get them to you later this week. In the meantime, I’m jumping on the train of something I first saw on the Lean Green Bean blog: “What I Ate Wednesdays.” It’s just what it sounds like–every Wednesday, you chronicle what you ate for one day, one week, one trip, whatever. And today, I’m joining the WIAW club.

Tree growth, like all plant growth, depends upon both environmental and physical factors such as temperature, sunshine, wind, soil properties, steepness of slope, snow and rainfall. During the growing season when snowmelt and rainfall are plentiful growth rings are wide. Conversely, when drought occurs tree ring growth is significantly diminished.

"...You see these people, like guys in wheelchairs with stumps of legs just reaching the edge, or people with burns on their faces. Maybe their legs got blown off in a war, or someone threw acid at them. I never really thought about them. If I thought about them at all, what I thought was how to get past them without them touching me. They grossed me out. But now I thought about them all the time, how one minute you can be normal – beautiful, even – and then something can happen the next minute that changes it. You can be damaged beyond repair. A freak. I was a freak..." (p75-76)

David Brooks argues that the future of health care comes down to "centralized technocratic" planning or a a free market solution. Health care, he sagely observes, is "phenomenally complicated," then goes on to inform us that providers have more information than patients and that insurance companies "are rapacious and are not in the business of optimizing care."
“Yes, that would be really nice actually. Sure” he replied.
I think you’d be hard pushed to deny that this version is more entertaining. From the off it strikes a good balance between plot, character development and action. It doesn’t try to dig as far into the hero’s psychology as Lee’s film, but as that crippled the earlier attempt it’s for the best. Norton is a more appropriate Banner than Eric Bana was, achieving drama, humour and action with aplomb. In fact, even though there’s notably less of it, it seems Leterrier and his cast are as adept at crafting dramatic scenes as Lee and his lot were. They’re certainly better at action sequences, of which there are a good number and all well executed. Attempting an athletic chase over rooftops and through small streets so soon after Casino Royale and The Bourne Ultimatum did similar things to such acclaim seems a bold move, and while Hulk‘s version isn’t as memorable it doesn’t suffer unduly from comparison. The final monster-on-monster punch-up is immeasurably better than the first film’s bizarre climax, but the real stand out for me was the battle on the university campus. All of this is helped by vastly improved CGI. No longer is the Hulk an oversized action figure, but instead has weight and grit, and is altogether more believable. You’re never going to be convinced he’s real, obviously, but this time round they’ve made him more than close enough.

Heat a wok or large skillet to medium. While it warms up, mix together the gf tamari and mirin. Once the wok/skillet is heated, drizzle a little (no more than 2 teaspoons) toasted sesame oil and let it warm. Add the eggplant and stir fry until eggplant is almost done. Add your sauce once the eggplant is almost done and make sure to continue to stir while adding the sauce. You will not use all the sauce. Use just enough to get the eggplant coated well. Refrigerate the leftover sauce. Once your eggplant is fork tender, take it off the heat. You can serve this warm or at room temperature.

And in a strange way she is helped by the killer she is looking for. And Flare has some revelations in store.

Six years ago, as a work of art, Morag Myerscough and Charlotte Rawlins created a pink neon sign with the question HAS ANYBODY SEEN MIKE HUNT? The British Library included this neon sign in an exhibition, but positioned it in an out-of-the-way spot at the top of the building for fear of offending passers-by. Today, six years later, the British Library feels no need to do that. What is considered offensive has changed and the word “cunt” is uttered on BBC Radio 4 at breakfast time without sackings or resignations following. It is said times have changed.

With Ayden, all of this becomes very trying at times. Opening presents causes anxiety, the waiting while others open presents is difficult as well for him, thanking those that gave gifts is also a small struggle - but through it all he manages. We do what we can for him, without letting him skip out on anything. It's always been important to us that he learns to take part in family gatherings. We do other things to help with the stress it causes such as allowing him to do his favorite things longer or eat all day if that is what he wants. I know many other FX parents that will alter and change the way their family celebrates by doing things like opening all the presents for the kids and leaving them in a pile to attack on Christmas morning. I don't have any issues with this as it works for some, it just isn't what we wanted. It much more important to us that Ayden is a part of our family events where he feels accepted and welcome so when he does things like this outside of family, he will be much more comfortable.

En el otoño de 1970, durante una visita a Cape Cod, toca con la banda de dixieland de Ronnie Bill en el Holiday Inn de Hyannis y es invitado a tocar con ellos, lo que hizo durante unos seis meses. En el otoño de 1971 se compró una casa en West Harwich y se mudó a Cape Cod. Viaja a Japón con George Wein y Dizzy Gillespie y efectúa una nueva visita a Europa. En 1973 graba 'What a Wonderful World', con la cantante Teresa Brewer en dos de los temas. El siguiente año Hackett, con un sexteto que incluye el saxo tenor Zoot Sims, graba 'Strike Up The Band' (Flying Dutchman). Además, crea su propio sello discográfico (Hyannisport Records) que produjo varios lanzamientos con Bobby y su compañero de Cape Cod, Dave McKenna. Cuando no estaba de viaje, tocaba con frecuencia en Cape Cod, a menudo con su hijo, Ernie, en la batería.

Although many people seem to focus on that dark side of Preston Castle’s past, maybe because they like to be scared and then go home, as I left the amazing castle, I couldn’t help but think of all those boys who came through its doors, and the reality that it was built because there was an upswing in juvenile delinquency during that time period. Which means to my mind, there must have been something going on in society that caused most of these boys, and presumable girls, to have to live on the street and sustain themselves through crime.

After about 5 days of rain we finally had one day that the sun was supposed to come out. I took this as my chance to go hiking on the south side of Poteau Mountain. I don’t get very far down one of the trails I”m following and I hear the roar of water off in the distance. I love trying to find new waterfalls so I go off trail and head towards the sound. It’s rough going bushwhacking with all the rain slickened rocks and debris that I had to scramble over. As I got closer to the roaring drainage the brush cleared away. The source of the sound was a waterfall pouring over a horseshoe-shaped bluff.

Workman also touched on NOVA’s current plans for next year’s venue. NOVA is still searching. They are looking into Michigan Avenue hotels, which would put it closer to Art Chicago in the Park. Personally, I felt the derelict garage and office of this past May was actually quite a good environment. It's best for art fairs to be as far from the trade show format as possible. There’s just something really lame about booths in tents. No matter how big the tent and how expensive the booth. It screams science fair, craft fair and convention.
The fight against terrorism is no closer to success today than it was a decade ago when, in the wake of the September 11 terror attacks, President George W. Bush declared a Global War on Terrorism, The problem is not simply that Western agencies are outfoxed by state sponsors of terror and trans-national groups, but rather that Western governments and international organizations continue to suffer self-inflicted wounds. These include a failure to reach consensus on what terrorism is, political correctness that leads Western officials to downplay or ignore the religious component to terrorism; the legitimization of terrorist’s grievances; and a failure to recognize that diplomacy often does more harm than good.

Having dealt with grief, I definitely understand the desire to forget things. I can understand how the pain of losing someone can feel so unbearable you just want to shut off, at least temporarily. However, I can only begin to imagine the horror if your conscious mind really does shut off, and you can’t control when or where it happens. After a loss, touchstones become so much more important — items or places usually associated with the person lost can serve as anchors in a way, reassurances that there still is and will always be something solid to which you can cling.
More of N-’s cynicism towards the ‘common man’, ‘Inasmuch as at all times, as long as there have been human beings, there have also been herds of men…and always a great many people who obeyed…nothing has been exercised and cultivated better and longer among men so far than obedience– it may fairly be assumed that the need for it is now innate in the average man, as a kind of formal conscience that commands: “thou shalt unconditionally do something…it seizes upon things as a rude appetite…and accepts whatever is shouted into its ears by someone who issues commands– parents, teachers, laws, class prejudices, public opinions.’ More of N-’s brand of ‘psychology’ a sort of admixture of evolutionary psychology and cultural evolution; he asks us to consider that if human beings are ‘herd animals’, which it appears we are, that it might be evolutionarily advantageous (on a group level?) to have the majority geared toward having a ‘slavish’ mentality, a desire for tyranny, to be predisposed to believe what they are told, and above all a tendency to beunconditional, or principled. How ‘principles’, moral principles, are a method of despotism of the self, ‘thou shalt’ says the ‘reasons’ to the ‘instincts’, the ‘superego’ to the ‘id’. I wonder how well Freud knew his Nietzsche…
