Itching to play every game, frustration building up inside me, waking up sore every morning, trying to face the reality that I would have to be sitting out for who knows how long, in the spring of my senior year was hitting me hard.

I had this dream that women were in (the Olympics). Then all of a sudden Jason called me, yelling. I was like, 'What's wrong with you?' He's like, 'You're going to be in the Olympics.'

Marcellus undoubtedly has one of the stronger, rangier voices on the guys side of the competition, bringing the crowd to its feet with the final note of his performance. If he can sing songs that are a little more off the beaten path, he and his fedora should go far. Stephen called him "The whole package." He may be right.

The surety of the project's completion comes, says board president Terry Brett, from having all $12-million needed to build it in hand, including an $8-million gift from philanthropist Beth Ann Morean.
Many of those charged with crimes controlled purse strings or the ability to hire. They gave cronies contracts or jobs while the more qualified or dedicated got passed over. Former Cuyahoga County Sheriff Gerald McFaul is now legendary for the greedy demands he placed on his employees who paid him tribute on the taxpayers' tab.
And it’s true that’s what here — besides the smart observation that we tend to be nostalgic for experiences we never had — hardly rivals previous Allen fantasies like “The Purple Rose of Cairo” or “Zelig.” The film’s beginning is a bit slow and its happy ending suggests that Allen’s uncomfortable idealization of girlish females is still alive and unwell.

With such low scoring in hot, steamy conditions, it was the first time in the 10-year history of this tournament that the cut was under par. It was reflected in a bunched leaderboard, too, so very little has been settled except that Woods won't be part of the rest of the action.

Irsay tried to open the door, if only a little, for Manning's return, saying he would renegotiate the deal and have him back if he bought into certain conditions. He would have to take less money.

The political fallout was less predictable, especially with control of government divided and dozens of new tea party-backed Republicans part of a new GOP majority in the House.

-- What it is: With cool climate fruit from the New Zealand region best known for Sauvignon Blanc, Oyster Bay has made a crisp, citrusy Chardonnay with a touch of smoky mineral on the nose. Full flavors of apple and tart pear combine with bright acidity and gentle, soft oak, which adds texture and body to the long finish. This style of Chardonnay is the midpoint between our other Chardonnays to consider - the more austere unoaked Novellum and the Acacia A, which offers a creamier, buttery, spicy oak palate.
Kimberly Hawkins, who travels extensively in her job as a non-profit fundraiser for Raybin Associates, said she worries Clevelanders have fallen prey to the mindset " 'We're going to lose the hub and there's nothing we can do about it.'

Chris Korman (Ravens/NFL editor): For whatever reason, Denver seemed, to me, like the most improbable place for Peyton Manning to end up. His ties to Nashville are obvious, and the 49ers seem to be a team on the cusp of greatness. It will be interesting to see what Manning has to say about why he opted to join John Elway — athletes are often shy about being over-shadowed by legends who happen to still be living and working in town — instead of the other two options. As for Denver, the Broncos will now try to trade Tim Tebow. And they'll have very little leverage in doing so. We're probably all in agreement that Tebow will never be a prototypical NFL quarterback, but he's easily one of the most popular — and yet polarizing — players in the game. He brings buzz wherever he goes, and buzz equals money (if not necessarily wins).

"We Have a Pope" follows Melville after he escapes the confines of the papal conclave, where cardinals are traditionally sequestered until a new pope is elected. Like the character he plays, Moretti is a self-described "nonbeliever."

"Without wanting to be too direct, this idea of a pope who goes out among the people is a suggestion to the church."

For Adubato's part, the battle with Booker marked another notch in his already-solid reputation as a political kingmaker far superior to Newark's mayor, one who controls votes and political operators in a way Booker could only dream about.

You can learn a lot from charter schools. Because they experiment more. For instance, some charter schools have 210 days or 215 school days a year, not 175, which is normal. And some have much longer days, say, 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. So, if you just wanted to learn if it works to have a long school year and a long school day, you might want to look at charter schools.
Another song, "Monuments," began with a searching, off-balance solo introduction from Mitchell before coalescing into a more cyclical, head-bobbing groove that found Binney and Abbasi chasing each other through a knotted series of runs, and a later piece introduced as something new featured a bluesy turn from Mitchell and an interlude of lightning-quick fretwork from Abbasi that briefly recalled the fiery pacing of John McLaughlin.
"Why would I want to pay to see two guys in love?" asked Dan Dobleman of Daly City. "And not just any two guys, but the absolute epitome of manliness, the cowboy!

Archaeologists believe the topknots were a late development, added to some of the moai many years after the statues were erected. No doubt the topknot was, at one time, the height of Rapa Nui fashion.

Hey, Tony: Why doesn't Colt McCoy get protection? No wonder he drops the ball, he has to run for his life. The players either don't like him or they don't know how to play the game. Cause it's happening every week. -- Jane Kraft, El Paso, Texas

The 27-song concert had its awkward moments. It took the cautious Taylor a few songs to unwind; King, who has never been a terrific singer, struggled with the higher passages on her uptempo songs. But once Taylor relaxed, his honeyed, conversational delivery was engrossing — “Fire and Rain,” for instance, retains its ability to hypnotize. As for King, a few missed notes didn’t stop her from singing to the rafters, again and again. She’s a soul shouter at heart (which is probably why she was every soul singer’s favorite songwriter in the ’60s), and she roared her way through “I Feel the Earth Move” with glee, stomping around the stage, singing to her musicians and beaming at the crowd.

Of 500,000 premature births in 2010, the U.S. rate of 12 per 100 live births is more like that of a developing country, ranking 130th of 184 countries, tied with Somalia, Thailand, and Turkey, and only slightly better than Honduras and Timor.

But that is not what we did. We were forthright in our actions, and we guided readers every day to a place to find the material with ease.

"Ride" opens breathtakingly with Byrne, in his trademark white, singing "Once in a Lifetime" accompanied by a chorus of musicians and dancers, also in white. The dance is exhilarating where it might have been annoying; Byrne is thrilling, as always, in performance. The film, directed by David Hillman Curtis, also features interviews with Byrne and performers talking about the creative process. (8:45 p.m. Sunday at the Tivoli) By Gail Pennington

Helton is hitting .286 and driving the ball to all fields. His eight RBIs lead the Rockies. There's a good chance Helton will stay in the groove as the Padres come to town. His .348 average against them over the last three seasons is his best against any National League West team. Helton also has fared well against Padres left-hander Cory Luebke, going 4-for-8 with an RBI.

This doesn't make a lot of sense. Fortunately, Portantino's bill isn't likely to impose a big burden on hunters or target shooters if it passes because it contains well over a dozen exemptions for such innocent rifle-bearers. It exempts people carrying rifles on private property that they own themselves or where they have the owner's permission to carry; it allows people to carry their rifles in public if they're in cases or locked containers; it excuses gun dealers and hunters and others who would have legitimate reasons to be armed, and so on. Yet this is a bill without a purpose.

A: I have never been close in the wild other than here just recently. Though I've been to Africa on safari and seen lots of wildlife, never a wolf close up. But at the center, I've literally been a couple feet away from them. It's amazing. These animals are charismatic, powerful. Hearing them from my desk, howling, is such a cool thing. To think that hundreds of years ago you'd have heard them in your own backyard. It's been pretty amazing to see what we're doing to help them. What's really struck me is that all the Mexican gray wolves that have been released into the wild have a connection to this center. In 1975, those remaining in the wild were captured and brought here for breeding so that every single animal now in the wild has some sort of lineage trace back to the center.

 The Baltimore Colts moved in March 1984 with Robert Irsay moving the team in the dead of the night. Irsay was asking the city of Baltimore for money totalling anywhere from $25 million in stadium improvements or a proposed development of a major domed stadium to house football, hockey and baseball that would have cost around $78 million. Neither plan passed into law for various reasons. When Baltimore finally got another franchise, taking the Browns from Cleveland, it cost $220 million to build Ravens Stadium in 2003, 19 years after the Colts' departure.

For political trips benefiting his own campaign, Obama's team repays the government for air travel under a formula that's based on what it would cost to charter a Boeing 737 for a comparable trip, according to the White House. Obama's campaign doesn't have to pay the full cost for a chartered plane, though. It pays a reduced amount based on the number of people aboard Air Force One who were traveling for political reasons. That number excludes Secret Service agents and other support staff who always travel with the president.

Being at the helm of a boat calls for judgment, experience, and skill; gauging the seas, the wind, the way the boat moves, the skill of the crew, the feel of it.

THE ANSWER: First of all, I think you have to want to do it. Most big companies have two different sort of tracks for technical people. There's the track that you get promoted as a technical person, so you get more salary, more responsibility. But you're technical, you're still in that line. And that's equally good. Then there's management, where you're managing people. And they're different tracks. I think if you want to be a line manager, which is really a statement about profit and loss, you've got to want to do it. If you don't want to do that then don't get into running a division, or a company.

When hearing that "West Side Story" is in town, the question immediately becomes, after seeing the movie, hearing the songs in everything from commercials to talent shows, and being subjected to more than 50 years of community theater and high school productions, is there any real reason to see it again outside of pure, unadulterated love for the show?

The last two couples have to make a plea for why they should win -- and it turns out their former housemates are the ones casting the votes. Tenley says the break-up of her marriage cost her her home, and her parents were financially hurt by that, too. But if she wins the money, she's also going to have some fun, she says. "I'm not gonna lie." The votes come in -- the winning couple is Natalie and David. Then, the twist -- they each have to vote, too. Their choice -- take all the money, or share it with the other. If both say share, they share. If one says keep the money and the other votes to share, the one who voted to keep the dough will keep it all. But if both choose keep the money, the dough will be split among the housemates.

Dimora's political power in town was augmented by his role as chairman of the county's Democratic Party, which under the old system held a lock on all nonjudicial county offices. FitzGerald, former mayor of Lakewood, came from a different, younger wing of the party.

A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965): OK, not technically a movie, but available at the video store. Besides, it's not really the holidays until Linus hushes the crowd with a simple, "Lights, please," and proceeds to tell Charlie Brown - and the rest of us - what Christmas is really all about.

Now I'm quick to note this is not all their fault. I've long bemoaned, for starters, how men in general and fathers in particular now are the butt of jokes in our popular culture.
