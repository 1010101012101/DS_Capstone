Sadly, our human intelligence and the creations and inventions resulting from such intelligence, was what has in fact led to the deteriorating state of our health and the very destruction of our world, our planet and reality. We have been engulfed in our own human miscreation. The disintegration of the earth and all its life forms is a result of the melting down of our individual selves, the breaking down of the different parts of who we are, and the breaking away of the self from other selves and of the self from Spirit.
I've lost 0.7kg in the last 2 days. Awesome! I am blocking the big numbers out of my head (they just overwhelm me and get me down then I want to eat for comfort). Instead, I'm focussing on making each day as good as I can, so when I hop on the scales the next morning, I can be down 0.2kg.
First of all, I must say that I absolutely L-O-V-E teaching. It makes my heart happy to get to know these kids and become their classroom "coach". I love my commute (two stop signs & three turns which totals .3 miles). I love that on some days I can grade papers, go to yoga, stop by the store, start dinner, and STILL be home all before I would start my commute for my last job. I love the school, teachers, students, and overall moral there.
Naturally that can also be read as a warning. Still it’s interesting to see Jefferson do what so many in our own time do in coming to a natural conclusion on the obvious differences in the races, yet flirting with the idea that he wishes it were not so and that it will one day, miraculously, go away.

In short, I try to stretch their comfort zones, increase their self-awareness and work ethic and challenge them to try new things especially if they seem different or scary. I try really hard not to say “no” or “don’t” without first asking why and I never punish (whoohoo time outs!) without making certain that the child understands and can tell me what they did that was wrong.

The argument against homosexuality from the Creation order is also hazardous on other fronts. Virtually all churches reject the notion that God created sex for procreation only despite the fact that the first man and woman were commanded to be fruitful and multiply. An argument based on an inability to reproduce is all the more problematic to defend given the vast number of marriages that never lead to procreation. Some couples marry at ages when childbirth is no longer an option. Other couples are childless because of impotence, infertility, health restrictions, or genetic concerns. Still others opt to not have children for a variety of reasons. The lack of children doesn’t invalidate these relationships nor does it devalue them.
Set in the Missouri burg of the title in 1903, the film centers on the Smith family, middle class and ready to see and celebrate the coming Louisiana Exposition of 1904 but instead of a straight narrative, St. Louis is really a set of colorful, sentimental vignettes set to some of the catchiest tunes and loveliest melodies to come from Hollywood in the 1940’s, with Garland of course taking on the bulk of the lilting tones. Along with “The Boy Next Door” and “Under the Bamboo Tree” with the precocious moppet Margaret O’Brien, Judy and gang belt out one of the most glorious four minute interludes of musical magic known to the golden age of American cinema with “The Trolley Song”. Written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane, “The Trolley Song” was not only nominated for an Academy Award as the year’s Best Song (it lost out to “Swinging on a Star” from Going My Way) but had several very popular renditions that hit the airwaves during the decade. The most enduring song to come from the St. Louis musical resume however, was Judy’s poignant holiday signature, “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”. Hauntingly beautiful in its delivery both visually and audibly, “Christmas” has become a standard on Yuletide play lists.

To think it was only a few decades ago that people were allowed to have four, five or six children! If it weren’t for the old pictures, I wouldn’t have believed it. My friend, Marie, tells me her mom was one of ten. TEN??? That’s just so gross. I’ve heard there are still some large families in existence, but thanks to the new child tax, those overpopulating kooks will be taxed out of existence soon. Of course, if they want to continue violating the laws, they can pay their fines. That’s fine with me. (lol!) My future kid’s school can use the extra money!
Doubt, while seen in some circles as anathema a relationship with God, can be thought of as a transformative process in our journey toward God and essential to a faith journey. Rabbi Rami Shapiro said, “The role of the community is to challenge one another so that you maintain doubt and open-mindedness. When a community tries to fix things for its members, it’s disaster. The individual has to work through their own life experiences with the support of the group–but it has to be their own authentic work.” This reminded me of the classic “enabler” paradigm when a well-meaning friend or family member tries to intervene in a loved one’s life, but ends up helping them (enabling them) to avoid an issue they need to work through.
I was, with some friends, organizing a festival and gigs in Lille since 2010 and I got to reconnect with the local underground scene as well as the international one. We’ve been having something like 90 bands playing there in two years!

Oh, my God. I am just about to burst out of my freaking skin in anticipation.
So today in my testing room, there was about 45 other students in the classroom. It was a very strict setting. We were not allowed to have cellphones WITH US AT ALL. We were not allowed to bring out jackets in the room - they needed to stay outside in the hallway on the floor, you know where they can possibly go missing. We were all in assigned seat (I was seat 218). We are only allowed to go to the washroom on break, unless it is an emergency, but you do not get extra time. This rules are strict, but they depicted efficiency and organization.
In the south, a bi-sexual married man is a contradiction in terms. No woman on the Creek, or in Poverty, stayed married to their husbands after this fact was made public. Country women are a proud breed, and don’t follow the main stream when it comes to this kind of betrayal. Eunice was totally beside herself when Delmar told her about the secret he had been keeping from her. “You don’t love me?” She asked him. “Of course I love you” he replied. “If you love me, how could you do such a thing? Are you a queer?” Eunice asked as tears ran down her face. “I don’t even know why I’ve been doing it. I have no idea what possessed me. Satan must have really had a hold on me. No, I’m not a queer. I love every inch of you.” Delmar responded. He couldn’t have been more apologetic as he attempted to wipe the tears from her cheeks, and she slapped away his hands. “Don’t you ever touch me again. You nasty pervert! Satan wasn’t having sex with other men. You were!” Eunice stated, as she smacked him across the face.

It is quite illustrative of several issues: What happens when faith leaves a person; what happens when a spiritual leader betrays the trust given him/her within a community of believers; how public media (ostensibly funded by our government) manipulates news accounts to provide only a certain slant; and a whole lot more including a convention of atheists (which I’ve heard about from other sources too).

It makes me wonder where he comes from and what kind of upbringing he had and what on earth he thinks people are doing in this country. I listen to him talk about a 'Big Society' and all I can hear is a man of privilege who has no clue of the struggles that people go through, or the way communities already rally round, or the amount of voluntary caring and giving people already give, of the amount of charities there are out there working in communities already doing so much to improve peoples lives.
The audio isn’t always the greatest, given that for the first part of the hour we were basically talking to one or three people on the front row five feet from us, so we weren’t yelling to be heard in the back. After watching it, I realized that I did my level best to dork up the entire thing, sitting as I did with a large enough space between me and Keith that all three of us don’t always fit into the picture. Whoops.

Miss Bonnie really liked the mango flavor, while I was more partial to the lime. I’m not real big on frozen ‘ritas, but this will be nice during the heat of the summer (if you want a good non-frozen one in AK, try the African Margarita they mix up at the Dawa Bar).
The second problem with the United Nations is that it has no ability to enforce its resolutions. I would give it the authority to create a military force that would be capable of intervening in disputes between members or in cases of civil war. This force would enable the United Nations to offer a guarantee of support for any member nation that may be attacked. It would free up resources from countries like the United States that have been dealing with these sorts of problems around the world — the United Nations is the proper instrument for action in these cases.

Both these stories are examples of primitive, tribal thinking. It is a mindset based on an axis of honor vs. shame. We know that the bizarre family in Florida will get due justice. In fact, they’ll get a whole lot more time and more hearings than they deserve, given the mandarin-like environment of our justice system.

The Tinley Park woman’s was charged in February 2011, when officers found dead animals at her facility. They also seized 63 dogs, 31 cats and six rabbits and removed 30 horses, ponies, sheep, goats and llamas.
As for literary inspirations, I had just finished reading Dostoyevsky’s Notes from Underground when I watched the film, so I found the ballerina’s psychological state, particularly the ‘inner voice’, inspired from the works of the writer – especially the narration style, spiritual and political (read financial/career) influence. But I brushed off my hunch as a coincidental thing. Later, I read in an interview that the auteur had been inspired by Dostoyevsky’s The Double.

At this point I glued the underdrape into the frame I built in Part-One. These ecru panels fit entirely inside the frame. Next I glued the stripe overdrapery in front of the ecru panels. The stripe panels will cover the outside of the frame. I used the "Sequin Pins" mentioned in Part-one to secure the panels at the top and at the tieback point.

Firstly, Monday I went to Raggamuffin, a Reggae music festival. Fantastic music but got stoned just by standing in the crowd. Ended up with the munchies by the time I got home! No where near a computer all day.
Greek yogurt: Some of us can’t stand traditional yogurt, but when it’s this thick and creamy we will race down to our favorite market just to stock up on it. Besides its wonderful texture, Greek yogurt “keeps you satisfied longer,” according to sports nutritionist Leslie Bonci, MPH, RD, because all proteins take their sweet time leaving your stomach.

I considered using gold leaf sheets but ultimately decided I'd need way too many sheets to cover a surface so large. And I really didn't want a one dimensional finish. It needed to be gold but vintage-y looking so the feather details really stood out.
I have yet to see the movie (I do intend to, even though I very often avoid movies that have been adapted from books), but I do hope that it is better than the book. I have spent quite a few hours reading reviews of the book (and movie) to see if anyone else feels/felt the way I do about the book. I am sure that this could have been an amazing story of resilience, perseverance & triumph – but I came away from this book with a distinct feeling of disappointment. The Rabbit Proof Fence barely scratches the surface of what these girls achieved & skims over just about everything that was of interest within the story. I don’t feel as though I learned anything by reading The Rabbit Proof Fence, other than the fact that 3 girls spent 2 days at the Moore River Native Settlement, escaped & walked for almost 9 weeks through the Australian bush, surviving on handouts from people they met along they way.
They didn’t, of course. I mean, to begin with they accepted me and all, but there was always this vague sense of unease, like they knew I was hiding something, but couldn’t figure out what. And then bloody Mr Hangley had to perform what was tantamount to abuse on that poor, unsuspecting tangent secant theorem, and I couldn’t help myself: before I knew what I was doing, I’d opened my big gob and corrected him, and once the words started they just kept pouring out, a torrent I’d been hiding inside for so many years that when they finally spilled over, they flooded everyone within a five mile radius.
For those who care Liverpool beat Chelsea 1-0 yesterday, and even Chelseas 50million pound star Torres failed to make any great impact. Liverpool played well, Chelsea ran out of ideas and showed little creativity. But that will change if we get Sturridge back from Bolton and sell Mikel, Drogba and maybe Anelka.

The legions were numbered...but since there had been so many legions created and disbanded, they took to giving themselves nicknames. The nicknames could come from any number of sources, such as where they were headquartered, i.e. Hispana (Spain), Macedonica (Macedonia, north of "Greece"), or Italica (ur, duh, Italy); from the emperor (obviously after the Republic turned into the Empire), i.e. Flavia, Augusta, Traiana; from the Gods, i.e. Minervia (Minerva), Iovia (Jupiter) or Herculia (Hercules); from some adjective describing them, i.e. Felix (lucky), Victrix (victorious), Fidelis (faithful) or my personal favorite, Rapax meaning "Devourers". Or there were the ones, like Aquila or Alaudae (larks) which were taken from animals.
There is a bank building burning on Stadiou street, next to Syntagma. Thousands of people are still next to Syntagma square and King`s gardens.
One could do nothing all day, every day, but collate astonishingly lunatic utterances made in 20 Western languages by Progressive heads of state and government ministers, media personalities and other celebrities, journalists and professors, and many important opportunists in the corporate world, the military, etc. who bolster the utopian juggernaut to further their own careers. The feeble-minded zillions, particularly the impressionable young, shimmy to this tune as though compelled by electrodes implanted in their frontal lobes.

At this point I tried the sweater on to make sure I liked the placement of where the design was wrapping and hitting my body. When you take it off, the painter's tape will have stretched with the sweater and possibly even torn. DON'T WORRY. Again, the tape is just meant as an imperfect guide. Smooth it back down and forge ahead! I promise it won't matter.

So the big businesses Microsoft and Sony get richer and stores like Game Stop and Play N Trade get poorer. Most of Game Stop and Play N Trade’s business is from buying used games for cheap and over selling them, so without used game they would lose a lot of profit. Also, don’t forget about the consumer, the common gamer will get poorer as well. So it’s a win for Sony and Microsoft and a lose for everyone else.
Eventually, by now addicted to cocaine, Jason was given a seven and a half year prison sentence, of which he served two years, nine months. During this stretch in one of Her Majesty’s finer residential establishments, he joined the education programme and volunteered for a ‘drug-free wing’, where he was given help and support to kick his habit.
I have to admit that I'm really bad with holidays, mainly holidays that we don't celebrate back home. I just don't memorise these dates and I know they are coming only when I get an invitation to go to my kids' school for celebration. With Mother's Day this year happened the same thing.

Of course I started with the shampoo and I was really happy with the scent it wasn't overwhelming is was a very slight scent which I really like myself. I did not have to use a whole lot to get a lather along with the lather I felt that is washed my hair very well and it did rinse out very nicely. It did leave my hair very soft feeling which has actually been a little while for that plus I loved the little shine it did give to my hair. Another thing I did love about this shampoo is that it offers a UV rays protection which is really important since the sun can dry ones hair out so much.

But the colour's not all. The Cremesheen formula is just gorgeous. Pigmented and matte enough to feel like real lipstick - because hello, I have like 8 similarly toned sheer & shiny lipglosses, and that's just the ones in my purse right now. But with a slight sheen to it, so your lips look hydrated and soft. It also feels substantially nicer than the Amplified Cream formula... I can wear it all day in comfort, though I do need to put on a little extra balm at night-time. It also lasts a good amount of time, and when it does wear, it wears evenly (no gross crusty ring around the outside of the lips).

Earlier this year, I visited Greene King and wrote a couple of posts about it (here and here). In the second of those, I opened and tasted a bottle of Greene King Coronation ale, brewed in 1936 to celebrate the 1937 Coronation of Edward VIII, which of course never happened, as he decided he'd rather live in sin with Mrs Simpson than be monarch of these fair isles.
In this particular story a three-man group called the Fatalists is trying to peddle a death ray to various countries around the globe. No one wants it because it would be the end of the world. Since when has that stopped an aggressive nation? There are several right now who'd love to have such a weapon.
If you looked up above St Paul's Cathedral in the early afternoon of the 9th November, you could have counted at least three helicopters. Their deafening spiralling nearly drowns out what is happening below. They're the result of the ruthless over-policing of the slight return of last winter's student protests, currently marching nearby in Moorgate. This made the 9th a perfect day to explore this neurotically protected citadel of undead financial capitalism. Encircling St Paul's is Paternoster Square, or more specifically Juxon House, a nasty, Vegas via EUR via Duchy of Cornwall neoclassical superblock. In the last decade of pseudomodernism, this development has always stuck out for its kitsch revanchism, bolting onto itself Wren's Temple Bar, retrieving it from a garden in Enfield and plonking it a long way from the Temple itself. There's a ghost of a town planning idea in these Rossi-goes-to-Reading banks and offices, in the way they enclose the great dome with a series of narrow byways. Nonetheless this has long been one of 21st century London's most depressing, smugly jolly spaces. Not now, though.

We’ve all seen a lot of female celebrities walking around in sheer (see-through) clothing but many of them wear underwear and they really shouldn’t… To help showcase how sheer clothing is supposed to be worn I’ve tossed together a gallery of nearly 110 photos (click the image above to view the gallery) of models walking down the runway wearing sheer outfits.

We took off down the runway and soared up into the sky. Eventually, the intricate details of the Detroit metro city area was nothing more than tiny specks that then became non-existent once we were reaching the altitude needed to cruise into the city of St. Louis. The clouds were beautiful as always…fluffy white…the kind that I always wish I could touch when I am flying just to see if they feel like anything at all. After a while, it seemed that we are flying above the fluffy white clouds into clouds that are more thinly stretched and not as thought-provoking. I sat back and enjoyed the duration of the flight as the flight attendants like to instruct all passengers to do.

So forgive me if I make no sense on this blog. I feel like I am running in reverse. Oh, and I have a small confession to make. I didn't list all of my "ingredients" for my sister's birthday card. I neglected to mention one. You see, I used Glossy Accents on one item, and waited for it to dry before mounting the image. And when I went back to check on it, I noticed that it hadn't dried evenly. It had pulled away from the edges and pitted a bit. Crap. So I added another layer of Glossy Accents and waited again for it to dry. OK, so it was a little better, but still not the usual results. What the heck? I reached for the Glossy Accents bottle again, and realized that it was actually a bottle of glue. Duh. What? Oh, good grief. Giggle. No wonder it wasn't working like usual. Slap to the head. Giggle some more. And then actually use the Glossy Accents for the right effect. Giggle again. I checked it later, and was very relieved that it looked much, much better. Wink.

5. When my kids eat food that has been on the floor.I try to keep the house as tidy as it can, at least for a house with two active toddlers, a teenager and a carpenter husband.I could sweep the living room floor 50 times a day and you would still find cheerios, yesterday’s toast crusts, pieces of apple and goldfish crackers.I do my best to pick up the “old food” but there’s those few bits that will get missed.My kids can get very creative with their hiding spots and getting them a “play kitchen” for Christmas only seemed to facilitate that.When they were little and they dropped their pacifier on the floor in the grocery store, they would scream until it got picked up.But now they just pick it up themselves and pop it into their mouth.So, really now our job is to make sure that what they are putting into their mouth is actually food and is okay. It’s impossible to stay on top of all the germs unless you live in a bubble.
Today I will share what I learned about prepositional verbs. In a nut shell, prepositional verbs are made from a verb and a preposition and must have a direct object. Prepositional verbs can not be separated. You cannot break up the prepositional phrase...who is breaking into the house...NOT...who is breaking the house into.

But WikiLeaks did not stop. On 23 October 2010 the Iraq War Logs appeared, followed by the Diplomatic Cables on 28 October. The US administration managed to get Paypal and the credit card companies to cut off the supply of money in December, but WikiLeaks has not gone away. It was clear that a friendly government would need to be found to extradite Assange upon request of the secret grand jury that has been established in Alexandria, Virginia, and tasked with prosecuting a case against Assange.

True, the editorial at The Guardian did mention other African leaders and it did not hint at western leaders to be tried per se (only their generals!) Excerpt:
I love this city. I'll admit it: it's a bit weird. I can't figure out if it's a hot city or a cold city, a dry city or a wet city. That's alright though. This place has some of the best parks for dogs in the world. I can go to Stern Grove, Ocean Beach, or Fort Funston, and they're all only 5 minutes from my house. If you haven't, you should really check out Fort Funston...it's like doggy Disneyland. My parents sometimes take me to the park for too long, forgetting that I'm not a high energy lab, but a low-key bulldog. I can go for 45 minutes, tops. Well, when this one female dog is there I can go for a little longer, but usually it's only 45 minutes. When they push it, I need to sleep the rest of the day. Thankfully they give me delicious meals. There's this awesome store nearby called Sunset Pet Supply. Everyone and everything there is awesome. I just walk in the door and I get showered with treats. I'm telling you: it's great to be a dog in San Francisco!

My guilty pleasures are very simple--If I need to spoil myself, it's going to be baking something yummy, reading something frivolous, cozying up with a good cup of "coffee" (have I told y'all I call hot cocoa coffee!?), buying a new accessory, or trying a new beauty product! And I've gathered up some of my all-time favorite guilty pleasures to share with you all!
I guess I would learn to go to sleep alone if Nick did all this, but would it be good for our relationship? I feel like it wouldn't. I don't know why anyone would recommend this. I'm going to read that article again...

Giving the Order to Engage an Incoming Target will, I assume, ultimately be the responsibility of the Prime Minister as the Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces. It is an interesting conundrum to contemplate. Working on the assumption that a situation arises whereby an incoming target has been identified and all of the alternatives have been eliminated; an aircraft is now over a heavily populated area heading toward the Olympic stadium……
I’d seen how many other writers had handled sex scenes and often cringed. I feared and expected that same response to my own efforts. I may be able to fuck you on top of a car in a National Park but I can’t write about “throbbing members” or “moist folds of the flower” without giggling. Even if you can’t hear me giggling you can read it between the lines.

I’m sure you’ll have your own ideas, but for me, it’s simply about the power of sharing something with a bunch of other people. Just look at the faces of the people taking part. Yes, they are professionals, but the smiles look to me to be genuine expressions of delight, such a strong and instinctive emotion that it carries itself to those of us watching thousands of miles away via the Internet.

“He’d been part of organizing a conference call to respond to Vice President Biden’s foreign policy speech,now known best for the “big stick” remark. So some reporters were puzzled as to why Grenell…was not introduced by name as part of the Romney team at the beginning of the call, and his voice completely absent from the conversation. Some even called and questioned him afterwards as to why he was absent. He wasn’t absent. He was simply muzzled. For a job where you are supposed to maintain good relations with reporters, being silenced on a key conference call on your area of expertise is pretty damaging. Especially when you helped set it up.
I got home from work yesterday and David says, "Charles called, he is coming over to mow the yard". Our doorbell rings about 6:30pm, it's Charles to mow the yard. Splendid. He does half the yard and comes to the door for a drink of water. Lovely, come in, catch your breath, here is some water. I take a closer look at him. He has grown since I saw him last, the way 7th grade boys do. He has a smattering of freckles across his nose. Quick to smile. He goes back out to finish the yard.

While there are many great things about the Evangelical/Charismatic church, the clear distancing from the sacraments of the overall historical church is far and wide. From adding in Communion when it conveniently fits into a service and then running through a mishmash of phrases to bring some meaning to the act can be personally difficult. I guess I am slowly becoming a sacramentalist in the way I view some of the symbolic arrangements the overall church has used for hundreds of years.

I switched to a healthy eating regimen a few years back; and I still remember how exhilarated I was, as though I had been released from a mind control prison.

Tudor is a very free-form style. Typically they're very asymmetrical with very steeply pitched roofs. A wide variety of material is seen on the outside, although the best-known examples include some "half-timbering" - areas of stucco or brick broken up with wood timbers. The entry of a Tudor home is often modest but heavy, and windows are broken up with many small panes. Tudor style was very popular in the 1920s and 1930s and is seeing a comeback today.

Between Cottonwood and Phantom Ranch the trail snakes through sheer cliffs, following the river. The sound of the flowing water is deafening, precluding conversation and leaving the mind silent. These cliffs appear utterly different coming from this direction. Yesterday we traveled from Phantom Ranch to Cottonwood and yet I would swear that I had never witnessed such majesty. Ahead of us looms a sheer rock wall, a solid face of sepia, auburn, crimson and even violet. As we approach the canyon walls move away from each other, revealing the continuing path. We are hiking at a steady clip, the perfect speed to witness the unraveling of these optical illusions. Even for myself, scientist practically by birth, this place feels overwhelming magical. My thoughts dwell only upon the mysteries of the canyon, my senses completely saturated with the sights, sounds and smells of the Canyon. I reach out and allow my hand to brush along the rock face bordering the left side of the trail and for a brief moment I am connected to this place. I feel suddenly grounded, completely aware of my heart beat as it becomes just one of the millions of pulses throbbing around me. Even the rock seems to beat with life. A smile plays across my lips and I draw my fingers away from the stone to adjust my Camelback. Glancing up at the stone walls at the black stains left by rivulets streaming down the steep formations, I cannot help but see the stains of tears. Tears of sadness and beauty and joy; all of these human emotions, my own emotions, absorbed by the rock surrounding me.

I was building with the cushions on the sofa and sometimes I looked at her through a peephole between them. She felt me looking and asked: “Are you alright?” while she went on drawing. And I answered: “of course”. Then I crept on hands and knees into the end room and climbed onto a chair and saw how the snow was sinking down over me. Now the whole horizon had crept below the edge of the world. The fringe of forest couldn't be seen any longer; it had slid over. The world had capsized, it was turning over quietly, a little bit every day.

Although it is difficult to trace the exact etymology of the word “honeymoon,” some believe that it refers to the concept of romantic love being its sweetest immediately following a couple’s marriage. Over time, this theory posits, love gradually fades like the waning of the moon. The usage of the word “honey,” besides being sweet, may also refer to the European tradition wherein a couple would receive up to a month’s supply of mead (i.e., a beverage made of fermented honey) as a wedding gift to ensure a couple’s happiness and fertility.

My first love in collecting has always been set building. The first set I started building as a kid was 1979 Topps. It took a few years to get the 79 set completed, I believe it was in the mid 80s when I discovered my first Baseball Card shop - Bob's Baseball Card Shop in Sacramento, CA. This wasn't the first set I finished however. My first complete set was the 1981 Topps issue. I still recall the last card I needed to finish the set, #297 Bob Bailor. I bought pack after pack searching for this card. None of my buddies had it so I couldn't trade for it. For the longest time I didn't even know what it looked like. Then one magical day, I went to my friend Brian's house and we were looking through his cards and there it was, Bob's smiling face and bright white Blue Jays hat staring at me. I had no poker face to speak of and my friend quickly capitalized on my yearning desire to complete the set and traded it to me for 10-15 cards of his favorite team, the Oakland A's. Some might say I got robbed but I was as happy as happy could be. I was too lazy to crack open my set so here is a picture from COMC.

We enjoyed four dances together, and time it seemed both fixed itself during those dances, and yet sped hastily through them. NOTE: Never have I encountered a lady so light of foot and so elegant of manner. Thence it was that we were standing betwixt a gentleman of the cloth by the saintly name of Paul, and a rather fine longcase clock when the Lady of the Fans and I were startled by the clock’s sudden chimes tolling the hour of 2.am. She removed her mask, as did I, and in that moment I made a secret vow. ‘Twas at this time-freezing moment when suddenly, from across the room, there was a loud hullabaloo forcing me to turn about. When I looked back to the Lady of the Fans, she had vanished.

The Citizens have a superior goal difference. The only way Sir Alex and the Boys can win is one of two ways. City has to lose against Newcastle this Sunday. The Red Devils need to clean Swansea City clock big time. The final score needs to be something like 8-0. If City wins it has to be a score like 2-1 or 1-0.

Contrary to popular belief, the government back then was not laissez faire, although the market was freer than it is now. The industrial age was built on bribery, kickbacks, protective tariffs, government aid, land grants and yes, even legal monopoly status, all granted by the federal government. It was not a free market, Uncle Sam was not a disinterested third-party, and the captains of industry, thought hard-working and innovative, were not pristine free-market capitalists.

At least the 1989 iteration gave me a great stage memory. I tended to lose myself to the performance. I would gather up all the angst and frustration I had built up over the last chunk of time at school, work and elsewhere, and blast all of it out of me in a pique of adrenaline. I’m pretty sure I bled at every Turdburglars or Forestoryforehead gig.

was a rather apolitical affair and more in the tradition of “pure” comedy. The film has Groucho as a wily promoter who is after the money of a wealthy patroness who is desperate to make her way into elite social circles. An opportunistic German businessman signs a pompous tenor for his debut in the US, much to the dim-witted lady’s delight. Meanwhile Chico has become the manager of a talented tenor looking for a break, and illegally boards the ship bound for America. With the laconic Harpo thrown in for good measure, the Marx brothers create the sort of pandemonium that only they could, and the hilarious berserk that ensues makes a mockery of the best laid plans for those in charge. Groucho’s trademark one-liners, wry humour, straight-faced witticisms and cynical retorts made for some of the funniest banters. He, along with the zany Harpo and the eccentric Chico, made this madcap and irreverent comedy a delightful watch. Some of the most memorable sequences include, Groucho and Chico’s absurdist debate over a contract, hordes of men and women randomly being invited into Groucho’s tiny cabin in the ship, a hilarious dinner order, the fooling of an investigating officer in
I was mortified. Here my son was, thirteen months old, and he still didn't know how to shake someone's hand. I was a failure as a mother. I was a failure as a Mormon. My husband laughed.

In fact, the SANE nurse-in-training’s report said that the accuser had non-bleeding scratches on her heel and knee. As this fact publicly emerged, Goslee simply changed her theory, making the fantastic claim that as the “complexion of the victim in this case who was raped is a dark complected African American woman,” medical personnel (in a city that’s 38 percent African-American) would not have known how to detect bruises on the accuser.
Many movies have focused on this and some have been based on true-life happenings. The spirit of a deceased person trying to communicate with the living is one of the great mysteries that we want to understand. So why does the visitation happen? Many believe that the person who died may have left unfinished business. They may feel the need to visit their loved ones and reassure them that they are fine. There are also theories that the person never really leaves and their presence is felt constantly in the home in which they lived.

Even following, the long relationship with Bobby Brown, the community still seemed a bit surprised when news surfaced that Whitney and Ray were in an on again off again relationship. Despite the fact that he was 17 years younger than her, he wasn’t the “A-lister”, that people wanted to associate her with. Clive Davis and his team did such a great job at creating Whitney’s persona, that, her public never wanted to accept her Newark, NJ, roots which included her attraction to men who hail from places like Newark or Compton or the rough streets of Boston. Well, if we didn’t learn anything from Whitney, it was she was going to do what she wanted to do and live with the results of the choices she made. Her choice after Bobby, was Ray J.

This is calm, I muse softly, a terror so great it becomes nothing at all. Yet I find horror in this, that you could show me this promise of perfection.

MAKKAH – Several reputed scholars presented their papers Sunday, the second day of the three-day Muslim World League conference here on ‘Issues and Challenges of the Muslim World.’ The papers dwelt at length the causes and effects of the ongoing crisis in the Muslim World.
Seventeen top scientists and four acclaimed conservation organizations have called for radical action to create a better world for this and future generations. Compiled by 21 past winners of the prestigious Blue Planet Prize, a new paper recommends solutions for some of the world's most pressing problems including climate change, poverty, and mass extinction. The paper, entitled Environment and Development Challenges: The Imperative to Act, was recently presented at the UN Environment Program governing council meeting in Nairobi, Kenya.

And that something in the way turns out to be my naked Grandpa holding his underwear over his genitals.
Sounds like a lot of work, but it really was not.

The live production rolls fire-breathing action, epic adventure and heartfelt laughter into an original captivating story set in the mythical world of Vikings and wild dragons. Based on the book by Cressida Cowell, it centers on Hiccup, a Viking teenager who doesn’t fit in with his tribe’s longstanding tradition of heroic dragon slayers. Hiccup’s world is turned upside down when he encounters a dragon that challenges him and his fellow Vikings to see the world from an entirely different point of view. The story presents a vision so grand in scale that only DreamWorks Animation and Global Creatures could bring How to Train Your Dragon to life in front of a live audience.
When not playing, I was studying - I was a full time student of Poker and I loved it and still do, however when I started blogging and returned to the BNP, I realised that I could not devote my time to both and so Poker took a back seat. If I do something I like to try and do it to the best of my ability.

The novel centers around Glyph and his father Amiante, wood-carvers and, in the case of Amiante, a very good one. But he is not particularly motivated to work harder than necessary, thus earning fewer vouchers than he might, as well as antagonizing the local representative of the Welfare Agency, most importantly by his secretly making illicit duplicates (which is forbidden worldwide for any items as simple as printed text, since most of the planet’s trading profit comes from original crafts). The novel’s main concern is Glyph’s childhood and coming-of-age, as he first notices his father’s dissatisfaction with their society, and eventually comes to share it as well. The actions which Glyph takes as a reaction to his dissatisfaction are both drastic and life-changing.

Without all these minuses, HOUSEFULL 2 could have been a reasonable fare like Rohit Shetty’s GOLMAAL series. It has enormous scope for what one could call situational humour peppered with cutely choreographed numbers. The song filmed on the four lead stars sounds quite whacky, although a comparison with the title song of AMAR AKBAR ANTHONY could be considered sacrilegious! Sajid Khan therefore is more like David Dhawan and less like the late Manmohan Desai. What Sajid Khan is really capable of, unfortunately, comes at the end of the movie, where the cameo role played by the villain of yester years, Ranjeet has us bursting in splits. This happens when Ranjeet, on seeing the pretty lass, leeringly calls her ”Beauty”, but immediately corrects himself saying ”Beti” after realising who she is supposed to be! Were this scene not there in the end, HOUSEFULL 2 would have been worthy of many mouthfuls!!!! And you know of what!!

The fact that we managed to beat England inside 3 days by 10 wickets is beyond amazing, for many reasons. The problems of Pakistan cricket with the spot-fixing scandal are well documented. Added to the mix was a crazy captain who retired from cricket only to return months later, a mad Chairman of the Board who finally got replaced, a coach who quit because of the mad captain, and jail sentences for the Pakistani cricketer involved in the spot-fixing crisis. What you end up with then is the normal stew of Pakistan cricket: power politics, inconsistency, and wacky decision-making. It has to be said, though, that this team has been different. Misbah-ul-Haq may just manage to pull of the most incredible feat in the history of Pakistan cricket: being forgiven for losing a match against India in the World Cup. Under his leadership there is a calm and stability amongst the team that I certainly have never seen, and I doubt few have. Even in the days of Imran Khan there was an element of drama. Yet at 37 years young, Misbah has managed to do what so few Pakistani captains have done before him: get his boys to play as a team.

On top of that, CC's agency gave him a credit card to put his expenses on. They originally told him to just make sure that he got receipts and that they were travel related. He gets to his agency this weekend to turn in some receipts, and he finds a note in his box. This note lets him know that they will only pay for gas for one trip there, and one trip back. They also are expecting him to repay the account for the previous gas purchases. So, if we add this up, this is approximately $40 per one way trip. 2 times a week = $80. 10 weeks= $800 that is going to have to be repaid, as well as the other 12 weeks that are going to have to be taken in order for him to come back each weekend. So, needless to say, this sucks. The deal is that he is given a certain living amount to be there. He's been living very cheaply on food so that the majority of the money could be sent on his trips there and back. Now, if they won't let him spend it on gas, he's decided he will probably be going out to eat for every meal. It just doesn't make sense. He originally said he was going to ask the chief about it, but then again he didn't want to make a bad impression. He's going to spend the money he's given, just now it will be on expensive food instead of getting to come home. Either way, this is no fun. This also means that he might not be home every weekend. Agh.
In other mystery traditions, the HGA essentially refers to one’s Higher Self Essence, the CPU that coordinates the activities of all aspects of itself in all realities. In order to fully access It and these other fragments at work on other planes of reality, development of the Magical Personality (MP) is essential. As mentioned earlier, this is the magi’s representative to the spirit realms and the vital link to greater wisdom and knowledge, not to mention assistance. In this case, there has been a significant grounding both spiritually and metaphysically for a student to have full cognizance of using this wisdom and connection with integrity when they reach this level of advancement in the mysteries. Some believe that there is still potential for connection to a type of Anti-HGA, referred to as the Evil Genius by some. Who or what is this Evil Genius?
Yesterday, we ventured to the Sharjah’s Arabia’s Wildlife Centre. It is located between Sharjah and Dhaid.

There is a definite difference in the two hives – one is much stronger with more activity and in thinking about the Queens, they did appear different.

The unhealthy conditions are growing: sewage runs through one part of the camp. And it's divided into two factions: one headed by Irene (the sister of boxer Jimmy Abbott). This couple also have control of the only municipal electricity-point in the camp and won't let others use it. Irene rules her clan with an iron hand and demands that all the clan’s donations must be handed to her and her partner Hugo.
3. Never stop touching – it doesn’t matter if you’re screwing my pussy, my ass or my mouth. Don’t let your fingers go to sleep. Stimulation during sex shouldn’t just come from your cock. Guys have two more sex organs, they’re called hands. USE THEM. While your cock is enjoying my cunt, your hands should be stroking my face, my butt, my thighs, my shoulders, the nape of my neck (yes, please!) or even just playing with my hair. Touch, touch, then touch some more, because a woman’s brain will convert those caresses into extra bits of orgasm.

I described the opening of the Farmer’s Markets to my friend as my “Christmas,” and then was reminded by my friend that I am, in fact, Jewish. However, the feeling that I get when I see all the stands lined up with fresh produce, honey, jam, eggs and bread can only be compared to that of a small child, waking up and finding all of his or her presents colorfully wrapped under the Christmas tree. I’m looking forward to my next trip, and luckily, instead of twelve months, I only have to wait six days…

I am always grateful that anyone takes the time to read what I have written, and when they also take the time to comment, well, that's just an added bonus. Of course I would love it if everyone simply agreed with everything I say, but if everyone agreed with me the world would be a very weird place - and I would have nothing to write about. So as much as I love the feedback that supports my views, I also love the feedback that challenges me to think and write more clearly, or to reconsider the validity of thoughts.
However, I’ve known Danny for several years and it turned out he already had a photographer lined up for the main part of the wedding.

For their health: Madelyn missed 6.5 school days before we decided she would quit. 1.5 of those days were nervous bellyaches (plus many more on school mornings that I coached her to ignore so she wouldn't be absent). The other days missed were due to classroom viruses: colds, diarrhea, and an earache.
The Guardians also have counterparts, known as the “Fallen”, who possess the same powers as the Guardians but use it for cross purposes. Jeremy and Julian find this out when they encounter the leader of this faction, a smooth-talking but sinister character by the name of Damion, and only escape with the help of the Guardians. However, they are then pursued by Damion’s minions, zombie-like characters called “autonoids”, who are trying to get at Jeremy through Julian.
The line has 3 different fragrances, Orange Petalooza, Vanilla Flame, and Floral Cherrynova. I loved the Vanilla Flame, but ended up purchasing the Orange Petalooza Body Lotion which is a mix of Blood Orange and Hyacinth. To me it just smells fresh, summery and with a light touch of floral. The lotion is SUPER moisturizing. In fact, it might be the most long lasting lotion I have tried. I wake up in the morning and I can tell that it is still soaked into my skin. And you can't argue with the affordable $7 price tag!

Yesterday, I had the thrill! I came running downstairs to show my husband, and he just blinked at me. He didn't get it--maybe you will! I found a project off my blog on pinterest. I didn't pin it, I didn't search for it, and it wasn't pinned by someone I knew. I had a legitimate pin off my blog onto the Pinterest site--and it had 32 repins just from that one person's pin! When you are a little blog, it is the little things, folks. It made me smile!
Cameron may think that that is a good deal, one that can keep the majority of the population quiescent. And he may be right in that estimation. But he is not right in thinking that getting "schools 'n' hospitals" right (if that ever happens) is adequate compensation for the loss of our freedoms and independence.

“Email.” It escaped in a little death. He began telling me his, but I was tingling. “I won’t remem. . .” Lynn’s hand flew to his with a scrap of paper. I could hear the others scrambling for a pen.

I am delighted that Spring is here. It's a time for new beginnings and without going into too much detail, my job situation has recently improved a lot. I am still working in IT but I have had a career change in the industry into web development, which I am loving. Career wise, I also realise that I am enjoying more opportunities than I would be if I was still living in Dublin, where unfortunately the job situation is still pretty bad, from what I hear. It is times like this that I am glad to have emigrated to Germany.

Given a few key variables that change from person to person, we are able to exercise the choice to self-select our social networks. First, one must consider the perception of rudeness. As boyd explains in her 2007 article, when navigating friend lists on sites like MySpace, teens “will also add people because it would be socially awkward to say no them” and I do not believe that adults are any different (p. 13). I had a conversation with one woman I work with (whom I’ll call Mary) last spring who was distraught (no exaggeration) because, for the third time, a colleague had “friend requested” her on facebook. Mary did not want to “friend” this woman because Mary tried to keep her strictly work friends separate from her work friends who had crossed over into a closer area of trust. Unfortunately, Mary had already used every nice “excuse” for not accepting the request and was mortified because the colleague had approached her “in person” to discuss the matter. At this point, Mary had to make a decision to be rude to her colleague and absolutely deny the friend request, to figure out security settings to protect any unprofessional online conduct, or to change her behavior online.

I don’t think a grayshirt-before-January requirement would be a particularly difficult rule to enforce. Pick a drop dead date, put the grayshirt offer in writing before then and require it to be posted with the league office. Once the date passes, a school can’t make a grayshirt offer to any recruit in the present class. That strikes me as being fair, honest and ethical. It’s also for the benefit of the recruit. Which means it has the proverbial snowball’s chance in hell of being approved.

Indisputable is that their actions & lies following the 9/11 attacks were criminal, deserve punishment and, thanks to Nancy Pelosi, will go unpunished.

I got it months ago, but never used it. I stuck it my brush bucket, where it got shoved down between handles and annoyed me endlessly. I figured I'd better try it, before I ended up just chucking it. I was a skeptic, but I really like it. I spray it with face mist before I use it then blend away. I really like the pointed end for concealer as it gives a really natural finish.

Every gift I’ve received, for years, expresses a profound concern with my happiness and comfort. But it’s frustrating to look around my home right now and realise that:

Surveys* show that 27.6% of Dalits are still prevented from entering police stations and 25.7% from entering ration shops. Thirty-three per cent of public health workers refuse to visit Dalit homes, and 23.5% of Dalits still do not get letters delivered in their homes. Segregated seating arrangements for Dalits are found in 30.8% of self-help groups and cooperatives, and 29.6% of panchayat offices. In 14.4% of villages, Dalits are not permitted even to enter the panchayat building. In 12% of villages, they are denied access to polling booths or forced to form a separate line.

Because even though I've been where she is in some ways, in many others I will never know where she is. The explosive nature of losing a child, of burying a child, of not ever hearing their name called out loud in the playground or the supermarket breaks each mother differently. And then it re-forms us. And even if the world never sees the child we bore, they do see the resulting mother, and that mother is forever transformed.

In the 1920s, it was common for families to purchase automobiles, refrigerators, stoves, and other consumer durables with “installment debt”: that is, they made a down payment of about one-third, took the item home immediately, and promised to make regular payments until the item was fully paid. If the borrower failed to make his payments — even the last one — the item he purchased could be repossessed and he would receive no refund of his prior payments.

I’m finally in a better place with a lot of my adoption stuff. I have a long way to go, but I’m getting there. I’m moving on with my life. And the small adjustments I’ve made are paying off. I can’t complain… What started off as little ripples are having much larger effects that I realized. They are much more like waves.

So what do they do then? Well there are two schools of thought. There is the ‘shouty’ school and then there is the ‘flirty’ school. I find that both are tried by both sexes, and normally if one isn’t working the other comes in quick succession. I do hear of officers talking about the ‘attitude test’ and some are swayed with a bit of a flirt depending on their mood, but I would like to think that this isn’t how the majority of offences are dealt with or we would have to put a ‘shouty act’ and a ‘flirty act’ through Parliament!

Learning US geography has never been easier. This colorful, dynamic learning game offers a great challenge: answer the questions correctly to earn a state and built a pile of states high enough to reach the checkered line. Alex, my first-grader, loves this challenging game and barely even realizes she’s learning state capitals and shapes, state abbreviations, locations on the map, landmarks, bordering states, and more. In a very short period she’s memorized the location of all the states and tons of other useful facts. She enjoys increasing the difficulty level and collecting states for her personalized map. Geography has never been more fun. For more advanced students, Stack the Countries is a great tool too! That one is even challenging for me.

The Atlantic Yards advertisement must have been produced a while back, since it promises “6900 units of mixed-income housing,” while, after a trim, the project would include only 6430 units. It promises 15,000 union construction jobs, though of course that’s job-years, meaning 1500 jobs a year over ten years (or fewer annual jobs if the project takes longer, as is likely).

I didn't get to take my picture with Jillian, but I got a good picture of who Jillian is. I think there's a lot of "acting" in these situations and putting on for the camera, but cameras rolling or not...Jillian loves her work and her mission is to make your life better. I was amazed at how genuine she is and how truly un-judgmental she is. Is un-judgmental a word? I left that day with much deeper appreciation for Bob & Jillian and what they do on the Biggest Loser and to everyone being inspired at home. I also left with my answer to the interview question if I ever get asked.
Basically, sin is a part of who we are. This might be a startling and altogether incredible thing to suggest, but it is true. In Romans 7:15 Paul makes one of the most revealing claims about his own behaviour when he says ‘For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.’ In this passage he’s referring to his own sinful instincts and how they play out in his life.
mr. curry... sometimes our marriage is in such an intimate, sweet, closed door space, i can't write about it here. some smart asses in the audience may be wondering when the hell that happens... well it's NOW SMARTYMCFARTY. oh but i forgot!

In many discussions of this question that I've come across, I've also encountered a built-in, assumed, or implicit perception that a child with Ds is somehow a down-graded, or a challenged version of what he or she should be. That there is a certain kind of normal that, if it wasn't for the Down syndrome, that child would have a better chance for attaining. That Ds in itself is a challenge to be overcome. Something to be beaten on the road to normalcy.

When I was in college, my marketing professor had a guest lecturer in from a local Nashville business called Las Paletas. Her place was famous (infamous?) for not having any signage, and I guess it worked, because everyone wanted to know where the secret popsicle shop was. The product really had to be awesome, since having a brick-and-mortar where you sell only popsicles and manage to make a profit, sign or no-sign, is quite an impressive feat.

Perhaps oddly, a Communist state may recognise that better than the self-harming economies of the West.And finally we agree.

Grooms should be involved in the wedding planning process from square one. The sooner the involvement, the less separation he will experience from you and from the wedding itself. There are many things a groom can and should do. Think about square one – the first step. A date for the wedding has to be set. Date setting should be a joint project between two loving, equal partners. The location of the wedding also has to be a joint decision. The groom should have a say in where the ceremony takes place as well.

In the morning Jill was up an into the shower before I woke up. She was fully dressed as she exited the bathroom. She was serious about not screwing before she left so I went with it. She packed up her clothing and other items that she brought with her and I got dressed. Few words were exchanged between us as she prepared to leave. Her guilt was creating a tension between us.

Suddenly, all the murmuring of the Devas below stopped and all that he could hear was Krishna begging for forgiveness. What Bheem saw next sent a jolt through him. Had he not been afraid of being noticed, his teeth would have surely chattered in fear. There below him, Draupadi rose from the throne next to Krishna’s. But this was a Draupadi Bheem had never seen before. Her hair was loose, there was a fire in her eyes and rage had taken over her person. There she was, in her true avatar of Goddess Durga with a ‘ghada’ (loosely translated as a bowl) in her hands looking at Krishna. In a voice that echoed throughout the forest, she asked “Why is my cup empty? It should be filled with the blood of Bheem who broke his vow.”
For example, research in Minnesota in 2007 showed that people in a room with a higher (only two feet higher) ceiling came up with more abstract and uninhibited answers to questions than those in a room with a lower ceiling. Those in the lower room focused better on detail. This and other work suggests that higher ceilings help people think more freely and make abstract connections - just what a writer needs.

Why? When there is hope, freedom, and chance to have a fresh, clean start, why are we holding so tightly to the past? Why are we so desperately clutching our sin? The thought of relinquishing those things makes us act like our hearts are being broken into a million pieces. Why?
eUndies has recently been re-done to include some awesome new features, which add to the whole experience! For starters, there is a “soft add to cart” feature that allows you to add items to your cart without being redirected away from your current page – how handy! They also have an “Add this” button, so you can share what you want with your family and friends. You can also now review items!
Most notable on this “provisional” menu was the inclusion of several savory items: Wafu Ribs (as served at the Food & Wine Festival last year), Karaage (Japanese fried chicken), Miso Soup, Edamame, and a few Sushi options… sounds interesting, huh?

Over the past several weeks, we have come up against some resistance in our apartment experience. It all started with a phone call made from our new apartment to Steven saying that our old apartment complex wouldn't release our information because we hadn't give our notice to vacate. When Steven called me to relay this information, I took it graciously. Oh wait, that was the "loving patient Jamie" that doesn't come out in situations like this. Instead, I flipped out and started telling Steven all the ways that this was NOT possible. He, of course understood my point, but it didn't change the manager's mind.

Given the increasing degree of attention that IP is getting these days in India, as the readers of this blog must be aware of, it is not surprising that developing knowledge-driven sectors like Information technology, pharmaceuticals and media related industries are vying for the professionals well-versed in the language of IP. The latter enjoys quite an obvious edge over their counterparts, who, unable to ascertain the nuances of IP, often find themselves at a disadvantage with respect to relevance, competition and career progression.

The losing trio of tracks under the umbrella title of ‘Till Life Do Us Part continue the deep enjoyment. Parallel Worlds starts the trilogy bringing more of the unique and impressive sounds already graining the album whilst the closing Until the End takes one on a thirteen minute blissful journey of pure progressive pleasure, but it is the linking middle hypnotic instrumental Alive or Dead which hits the loftiest heights. It is immense and the declaration of this being a band that can induce rapture by music alone.
On March 17, several hundred members of Occupy Wall Street celebrated the six month anniversary of their first camp at Zuccotti Park by a peaceful reoccupation of the park—a reoccupation broken up within hours by police with 32 arrests. Later that evening a break-away group moved north, finally establishing itself on the southern end of Union Square, two miles away, even sleeping in park—though the city government soon after decided to defy a century-old tradition and begin closing the park every night just so they would not be able to establish a camp there. Since then, occupiers have taken advantage of past judicial rulings to continue to sleep on sidewalks outside the park, and more recently, on Wall Street itself.

Training and Development should be linked to the organisations rewards and recognition programmes that encourage people to collaborate and share. This further closes the gap between training and working in that opportunities are created for people to learn and build a learning ecosystem with easy and direct access to training materials and experts whereby the pursuit of new knowledge and skills results in improved networks and a stronger sense of belonging.

First, and most important, there’s evidence that HathiTrust was not searching for the authors themselves, but assumed that the publishers would be the rightsholders of these works. In response to an author comment that for a work published in 1958, the author would almost certainly be the only rightsholder because publishing contracts from the fifties don’t mention e-book rights, Kevin Smith comments that “The issue about who has the right to reproduce and distribute a digital copy of a work is usually a matter of interpreting the scope of the contractual assignment of those basic reproduction and distribution rights.” While this may be true in academic publishing, it’s certainly not the case in trade publishing, in which contracts explicitly lay out reproduction and distribution rights. The obvious conclusion is that HathiTrust didn’t find Mr. Salamanca because it wasn’t looking for him.

“Do we really smoke weed all that much?” I asked my brother the other day while at a concert. I didn’t mean him and me, I mean the whole state.

Because of her advancing age, the Queen only visits during the Canadian summer (June 30 - July 2).

When Peter suggested on Tuesday, the first of May, we could drive to Berry and then further on to Hampden Bridge, I joyfully agreed to this. We had a lovely day out. The weather was perfect for an outing. The good thing was, I didn’t have to walk much. Peter took lots of pictures. I took quite a few pictures too, some of them out of the window from the car.
The contrast between how it feels today versus yesterday shows that, at my most frenzied, I must enter into another state of mind. It hurt just as much if not more yesterday. I could barely type. The difference is that I embraced the pain. I kept enclosing that finger in my fist and squeezing it so that I could feel the sensation of it rubbing against the band-aid.

The second movement had none of the lilt which might have been expected from this orchestra, but rather a natural, flowing line, with shaping more pronounced than pulse. I feared for a moment at the beginning of the third movement as the firsts were scrappy and more than a little behind – my thoughts: oh, Schlamperei, please don’t intrude now! – though when I saw Nézet-Séguin’s minuscule beat I could see what the problem was. In any case things soon got onto a steadier footing, and Nézet-Séguin wound a very tight coil with the tension released only at the very last minute, in a glorious brass blaze of the sort that normally gets a raucous ovation (though never in a Philharmoniker concert). There should perhaps be something unheimlich and indistinctly menacing about this, neglected by YN-S and the Philis, though the hollowness of the triumph soon struck home in their final movement. Torment and despair registered, as they must, but never in a way which made me want to reach for the nearest Mariss Jansons recording. As in the first movement, D major heralded something new, with real breadth (I often find performances of this final movement lacking in length, or at least a sense of it), and gave the minor something of import to extinguish. How much this all had to do with Nézet-Séguin

In the waking state, one is constantly engaged in looking, smelling, eating, etc. The other extreme is the sleeping state where one is completely cut off and dull. The dullness and heaviness linger even after waking up. The more one sleeps, the duller one feels since a lot of energy is expended in sleep. Hence, the fourth state, where we are awake and yet at complete rest, is worth knowing. And we enter this state only during meditation.

Angels are genuine creatures that are given by God to assist the human race and also to act as messengers from the other side. Angels are authentic messengers that can help us solve our difficulties and troubles. No matter how lonesome or stressed out we feel, we’re never alone. Angels are infinite and are continually with us. They are never in a bad mood and they never fall short. They provide special information from God to emphasize unconditional love.

Picking at the Round 1, Umami opted for the two of three best receivers on the board. The league counts points per reception so that was a viable strategy, particularly since the WR pool was arguably shallower than than the RB pool. But this does leave The Teeth vulnerable at RB, with Best and Mathews as the starters and three similar pass-catching backs as backups. The rest of the team is not that exciting one way or the other. Umami thinks the team will be too inconsistent to seriously contend, but will be huge pain to play because of the possibility of monster receiving games from Johnson and Johnson.

I hope to get some cleaning from making dinner going and then get back on that room. Oh, I think the carpet is fine. The smell, as I realize now, wasn't from the carpet. It was coming from a little bit of water still in the unused toilet. Yep. The carpet pretty much dried out fast enough and on it's own. I still want to clean it, if I am unsure about the right steam cleaner (or really, fancier wet vac as none of them actually produce steam, I believe). The purchase of such seems to be a hit and miss thing. Some get great ones, some get pure lemons, quality control doesn't always exist for foreign producers and price means little or less.

Other regions were flat or declined.London declined by 0.7% in the quarter whilst Wales and Northern Ireland were outlying performers with prices declining 3.1% and 2.1% respectively.London and the South East (of England) have performed best over the past 12 months however with 2.3% and 1.8% increases respectively. However given UK inflation is running at 3-4%, all regions are seeing real declines. The outlook is shaky to negative.

Five students, A, B, C, D, E, took part in a contest. One prediction was that the contestants would finish in the order ABCDE. This prediction was very poor. In fact no contestant finished in the position predicted, and no two contestants predicted to finish consecutively actually did so. A second prediction had the contestants finishing in the order DAECB. This prediction was better. Exactly two of the contestants finished in the places predicted, and two disjoint pairs of students predicted to finish consecutively actually did so. Determine the order in which the contestants finished.
Literally 3 weeks before departure is when we made all of our reservations. I know that doesn't seem too spontaneous since most of our trips are decided a day or two before, but many people plan for months, even years for a trip like this. I didn't have the heart to tell Braelyn that we were going to Hawaii (she has been obsessed and talking about going to Hawaii for about 6 months now...not sure where that came from) so I told her the truth. "Kauai, sounds like Hawaii, but it's Kauai." I knew that she was going to have a difficult time, but I underestimated how difficult. She has major separation issues, she always has. Even as a baby she would silently sob for hours when we would leave and it never stopped. Maddox is a much different story however! Thank goodness because I don't think my parents could have handled two emotional basket cases!

Though a previous release showed voters were slightly happy with the results of the recent Wisconsin recall elections, that was because Republicans were more happy that they did not lose control of the Senate than Democrats were unhappy that they did not gain a third seat. By a one-point margin (48-47), Wisconsinites would actually prefer that Democrats control that body. Most of that is because Democrats have a three-point identification advantage in the state, as Republicans seem to now be a tad more enthusiastic about maintaining their majority than Democrats are wanting their party in charge, and independents split 43-42 for the GOP.

They would - I'm sure - say that they only travel first-class, that they are Diamond-Edged members of such-and-such an airline's Blah Blah club. All well and good, I would say as I drive them to the airport in a Town Car with crappy brakes and 300,000 miles on the clock. (Rich people use rich-people limo companies.)

There is no need to be afraid from your guardian angel because he is in this world to protect you not harm you in any way. They are sent to this world to shield you, guide you through rough paths, and make things easier for you. They will answer your prayers and protection will be provided to you in a most proficient ways. You can even talk to them and they will answer you back in human voice. However, you cannot see them, because they are angels. Just a desire to make contact with your Guardian Angels in meditation will be enough for you to succeed in it.

haven't spent much time in the kitchen and have instead relied on canned applesauce, plain rice cakes, and the homemade soups that fill my freezer. Well, that and the unbelievable unselfishness and strength of my husband who is not only the breadwinner of the family but has now taken on the title of Mr. Mom. Throw in my fabulous friend who lives next door and things are taken care of around here.
Today I offer two early recordings by the great viola virtuoso, the Scottish-born William Primrose (1904-1982). Originally trained as a violinist (a few of his violin records can be sampled at the CHARM website), about 1930 he switched to the viola, and the rest, as they say, is history. By 1934 he had made his first solo recordings as a violist, and by the end of the decade (at which time he was playing in Toscanini's NBC Symphony) he had committed several major works for the instrument to disc, including these two:

I recently went to the Cluny -- Musée national du Moyen Âge for the first time on the free Sunday a week or so ago. It was sprinkling on and off that day. It was a perfect museum to see on the free day, too -- not too crowded. That was my rainy day experience so far during this weird-weather summer.

Dear Heavenly Father, thank You for the privilege of having access to the divine secrets and mysteries of Your Kingdom.

The Lymph System is a network of organs, lymph nodes, lymph ducts, and lymph vessels that produce and transport lymph from tissues to the bloodstream. The lymph system is a major component of the body’s immune system. Because this system is rather complex, as well as it is truly unique and interesting, I’ve decided to make this a 3 part series as not to overwhelm (bore) you with information. As I’ve said countless times before…The better and more complete of an understanding you have of the how’s and why’s in which we all function as humans, the more likely you all are to adhere to some of the ways in which it’s possible to optimize the benefits of lymphatic drainage(which I will certainly delve into) .

The U.S. significantly weakened itself with that war. A swift battlefield victory led to a nine-year violent occupation, together with widespread sectarian, “honor” and homophobic killings and degraded living conditions in much of the country. Contrary to the plan, Iranian influence in the region has been strengthened, especially in Iraq. The Iraqi government’s refusal to grant legal impunity to U.S. troops forced their withdrawal, after which the U.S. had to scale back drastically its plans for a massive presence of embassies, spies and mercenaries. [16] The rulers had to face the limits of what the “greatest country in the world” can do–limits set not only by imperial overreach but by the deep global economic crisis. After all, the maintenance of the world’s most colossal military machine–more than half of world military spending–places a huge burden on the economy, which cannot go on forever in the face of stagnation.
Phonetically I do see the point. I can see why the mistake is made.
A Psychic on the other hand typically picks up on information through a series of visions seen through their ‘third’ or mind’s eye. Other senses may also be stimulated, such as their sense of taste, hearing, sight or smell. There is also the physical sense of temperature. Each Psychic is different and may use just one or any combination of these senses when picking up information. Some, like the well-known Scott Russell Hill in Australia and Alison Dubois of the ‘Medium’ tv show fame will receive the messages in their sleep. Many psychics such as myself also possess some sort of mediumistic ability and will use the two in combination.

What are you priorities? In a busy life, priorities are what you make time for no matter what. Some things in life are not and never will be priorities like, ironing, having tidy drawers, keeping my files in order and grocery shopping. Some things are always priorities as making time to exercise, research, meditation and spend time with my family. When you are confused about saying yes to someone, ask yourself, “Is this a priority?” If not, saying no may be the best course of action. There is only so many hours in the day. If I am going to fill up that time, I want to fill it with priorities. That way I don’t feel over tired, stressed or that I am

The documents in which are recorded all of the facts mentioned concerning the Sixth and Seventh Councils of Baltimore are contained in volume three of the so-called Collectio Lacensis, containing the acts and decrees of the Councils of the bishops of North America and Great Britain from 1789 to 1869, and published by Herder at Freiburg in Breisgau in 1875.

Today the BBC have been reporting on the review of Public Sector Pensions by John Hutton. It would be interesting to see how much he was paid for a few weeks “work” chairing this review. This is the same John Hutton, who as a Labour MP was raking in large sums of money from giving his name to the Board of Hyperion Power Generation, of the US, and who was a legal advisor to the bosses organisation the CBI, for two years. It is the same John Hutton, who in the run up to the election, along with his colleague, Patricia Hewitt, who also rakes in large sums from associations with Big Business, did everything they could to scupper Labour, and help the Tories into power. Its no wonder that the Tories have repaid such support for their cause by giving Hutton this job. The surprise is that the Labour Party continue to allow such people to remain as members!

From “Oscar Mayer Hot Dog Lover” to Pam and Jim’s romantic moments, this episode was perfection indeed. I believe my favorite part occurred when Michael began questioning Phyllis about her girlfriend’s ability to fit into a rowboat. Classic! The entire vignette had me choking with glee.
Sammy's version didn't do very well, peaking at only #117 on the Bubbling Under chart, but it became a classic at the Northern Soul clubs in England. Both songs are very well done, but Gary Lewis had the advantage of appearing on the Ed Sullivan Show to promote his version.

There are multi-layered concepts projected by this photo, probably one of the most important is that of intra-personal communication, not seen often enough in this age of digital conversation.

FYI’s for the uninitiated: “Natural Family Planning” means learning to read your body’s natural fertility signs, and then you either engage or avoid in intercourse depending on what results you would like.

Hi Ken, you mentioned that there are some TV critics you like.
The campfire that night was amazing with activities and a guest speaker from the Iroquois Nation. He taught them all some Native American dances and the meanings behind them. It was fabulous. I wish I had pictures from the camp fire, but I don't. 10 girls in a cabin meant little sleep, of course, but the next day was still great.

I would, actually, if she didn't fight sleep so hard. She needs to sleep around 11:30, for about two hours. She will sleep at this time about 20% of the time. The rest of the time she falls asleep sometime between 2 and 3 pm, once she has utterly exhausted herself and me. Not for lack of trying. What's the point in arranging your whole life around being home at 11:30 every day if she's not even going to fall asleep then? Poor kid. You make your own bed, and then you won't lie in it.
Specifically, when it comes to the wallet, everyone’s suffering…of that there can be no doubt. And what of the financial prospects for musicians and recording artists in the years to come? Shaky, at best. Unless you’re one of the grotesque ‘Idol’-type pop disasters in the top 5, you’re looking at getting a day job or finding other sources of income. Conventional wisdom amongst my peers has been remarkably short-sided over the last decade: “Yeah, CD sales are down, but all the money is in licensing.” Not anymore. “Yeah, licensing money is down, but the video game industry is killing it.” Less so these days, according to recent data. “Well, the real money is in touring.” Really? When was the last time you saw a ‘new,’ post-record company artist headline a major music festival? At this rate, we’ll be stuck with Coldplay for decades (no offense intended).

Ryan and Jetha show that our ancestors lived in egalitarian groups that shared food, child care, and often, sexual partners. Just as importantly, they explain why: they describe the nature of life before agriculture, and how it inevitably shaped and supported the human capacity for love, cooperation, and generosity-—including sexual generosity.

I dwelt on Jeremiah 31:3-4 the longest. God's love for me and for all of us is everlasting. He draws us to Him with lovingkindness either from His Word, those He puts in our path, or from His own presence as we go through desert times seeking Him. My heart clings to "I will build you up again". My God knows I need rebuilding, times of refreshing from the Lord. I am a work in progress, His "masterpiece" as Eph. 2:10 tells us, and He promises in verse 4 that He will complete the work He began in me--in all of us. I give Him praise today!

I suggest you read our book, "Social Dominance: An Intergroup Theory of Social Hierarchy and Oppression" so that any further objections you might have to the theory are at least on a correct understanding of what the theory is about. Unfortunately, you are not the only one to think that SDT is just about SDO. If that were actually the case, then the theory would be thin indeed.
In the last quarter of the previous century, prior to Nechtan’s modernizing ways, two of the most powerful northern nations fought a battle which was to be a cultural watershed: Nechtansmere (AD685) was fought on Pictish soil at Dunnichen Moss near Forfar in southern Pictish heartland; a Pictish victory and death in battle of Anglian king Ecgfrith put an end to Northumbrian interference in Pictish affairs. The only small outpost of Anglian religious education at Abercorn-on-Forth closed and its monks retreated to Northumbria. The two nations returned to relatively amicable relations until the end of the century.

Our Father God created us to be in relationship with Him. Not from a distance but in-person. Walking side by side with Him. This life we are living is a shadow of the life He created us for. Our bodies groan and cry out for the real life we were made for (Romans 8:23, 2 Corinthians 5:4).

When I talk to Christian women, they are usually not aware of any of these concerns, and in fact are quite secular and leftist in their voting. This is very disconcerting to me because it seems like they are not applying their state Christian beliefs to their future plans for marriage and parenting. Instead, they are happily voting for bigger and bigger government and they are oblivious to how this undermines Christian marriage and family.
Facebook is going public next year, possibly as soon as Q1 2012. Three months ago, Facebook’s business was estimated to be growing faster than previously forecasted and the company’s profits were said to be increasing quickly enough to make a valuation of $100 billion justifiable.

That’s a simple example of how trivial it can be, but don’t we see this in everyday life at work?

So why the nose? Simple. There is no better way to focus on this moment, the right now, than focusing on your nose. It isn’t in the future making plans and it certainly isn’t in the past licking its wounds. It is commonly accepted that the only thing we ever have is this moment in time. For me, this moment involves the thoughts and musings that are required to write this post. For you, it depends on where you are. It may involve your laptop and coffee on a Saturday morning. Or it may be your lunch at your desk on a Monday afternoon. Regardless of the what, one fact the remains—this moment is all that we have.

They were, indeed, quite nice at the clinic. When they saw that Z was actively bleeding, they took her right back. A nurse cleaned her up and we waited for the doctor. The wait was maybe 45 minutes, which as it turns out was a good thing. By the time he got there, Z was fully calmed down and in a post-adrenaline-rush crash. It was determined that the scarring would be the same whether we stitched or didn't stitch, so we went with the much less traumatic butterfly bandage. Z was disappointed that it didn't have actual butterflies on it.
My general impression of Darling Girl's shadows, after a month or so of use, is that the colors are, like, whoa with the awesome. The shades are spectacularly pretty and much more interesting than anything I've ever bought in a drug or department store. The only drawback I can cite is that, like most glitter/shimmer shadows, they're prone to fallout and fading. Here's where a proper primer and base (or two!) can really shine. In the photos above I've used e.l.f. Mineral Eye Primer in sheer, NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil in Milk annnndddd Fyrinne Pixie Epoxy (on the lid, under Taupe of Ole Smokey only). Three primers/bases and three shadows. This is how you know you're obsessed with makeup.

After the one thousand years will come the terrible judgment of the unsaved. Satan himself will be cast into a lake of fire which Matthew 25:41 tells us is “prepared for the devil and his angels (demons). Now we are looking way ahead down the trail–but after that will come the new heavens and the new earth. The earth will be restored to the style of the Garden of Eden where it all began and “the lion shall lie down with the lamb” (Isaiah 11:6-8.)

When I was pregnant of Elijah and we moved from Reedley to this house Josiahs crib fell out of the back of the truck on the highway so I thought Steve had gotten rid of it (since we knew Elijah wasnt gonna live here) and he acctualy had it in storage and recently we found out that the crib had been recalled but because the model numbers arent on the crib they cannot exchange it because we have no "proof " that it is the recalled crib. So I have been thrift store shopping for a crib and a changing table or a pack n play with the changer... ... looking for these items has been fun. The other day I became a bit frustrated because I havent found them yet and then I came to realize that I needed to be greatful that I am going to have a baby that gets to LIVE here with me. I remember saying over and over when I was pregnant with Elijah that I would give anything up IF ONLY he didnt have to go to heaven. So I resolved to not pout abut what I didnt have and be greatful for this new blessing. NOT 12 hours had passed when my phone rings and the person on the other side of the phone says they are sending us a baby bassinet!! Again GOD just being faithful.

This means that we will have recourse to the author-pays model, whereby the author of an article pays a fee to publish it. In most cases, it is the employer of the author who pays. Universities have a strong incentive to pay for the publication of articles written by their professors, as they have already invested so much in the production of the article in terms of the professor’s time, money for research costs, etc.

I expected “The Dirty Life” to contain the typical tales of a city-fish out of water, as the book describes how Kristin Kimball falls in love and becomes a farmer. There are a few hints of this in the beginning (blisters and unsuitable shoes!), but the book goes far beyond the cliches and the author retells how she grew to love both her future husband and the farming itself. She captures the first year of their relationship and truthfully describes the challenges and rewards of completely changing her life to start a diverse organic farm meant to supply both them and their “shareholders” with almost all of their food. Oh, and did I mention that they want to use horse-drawn machinery rather than tractors, that the farmhouse is falling down, and that they expect more than 300 wedding guests? She writes in retrospect and you know it will all work out, so the big issues fade into the background compared to her stories of daily life and working with the animals.
I believe in NFL minicamps. I believe in refreshing the Rumors page at espn.com to see the latest free agents and the grumblings about who might be going where.

So I don’t know. It seems that the endless delay of my self-realization worked out to my advantage. Does that mean it was “meant to be”? Probably not, but it is a comforting thought. Nothing’s perfect. I’m living proof of that. It would be nice to think that there was some overarching reason for going through the things I had to go through, for my little TS journey to take 20 years to reach its denouement, but I don’t believe that either. I believe we assign meaning to the events of the world and of our lives. We do it ourselves. To be epigrammic, because meaning is not where you find it:

Say hello to the Granny Stripe Afghan (pattern by Lucy @ Attic 24). It was started at the end of February as a distraction from socks and has been spread out on T’s bed for weeks waiting for a little attention. I’m using yarns left over from 2-3 other projects and loving the way the colors are coming together. The stripes are a “controlled random”, if that’s possible. I lay out the 8 skeins in an order that pleases, crochet the stripes in that order, rearrange the 8 skeins to suit and crochet another set. The goal is to use up the leftovers (although I’m pretty sure I’ll need to buy more before all’s said and done) and there’s no deadline on getting it finished. Fun and easy!
The Protestant Reformation was a movement in which people separated from the Roman Catholic Church after believing Catholic doctrines and practices were unbibilcal.

What is far more difficult is the choice that Arthur Huntington’s wife, Jolie, has made. She’s chosen to ignore the world’s perspective of her husband and her marriage. She’s chosen to remain faithful to the covenant they made before God and one another on their wedding day. She’s ignoring his disgrace and the disgrace that he has brought on her, their children, and their marriage. She’s returning faithlessness with faithfulness. That’s no easy task.

I have a terrible confession to make: I requested this book purely based on the front cover, and I was determined to read The Pursuit of Lucy Banning even before I knew what the novel was about. And after having now devoured this novel, it seems rather amusing that it was Lucy’s gorgeous dress that drew me to the cover, when she spends a lot of the novel wearing simple clothing as she doesn’t want to stand out at the orphanage where she works, or in her classes at the university.
But I digress… it is so nearly bed time! Hands moisturised, the final product to go on is none other than Solar Oil. For my poor old neglected nail beds, you see.

5) Pick out a whole bunch of items to try on (I tried on 18 pieces this year... some were fabulous, some were okay, some were completely ill-fitting and gross once I tried them on). You never truly know what will look good or how something will fit until it's on your body. The line for the fitting rooms are usually long, so browse the whole store and load up so you'll only have to wait in line once.

We get to Club Answer, one of Seoul’s coolest, hippest nightspots, a little after 1 a.m. The first thing we notice isn’t the large crowd that’s trying to get in—it’s the city bus-sized billboard promoting will.i.am’s performance tonight. With a promo like that, it’s no surprise that there are even more people inside than were waiting to get in. Apparently, they’ve been gathering since a little after 9 p.m.

Rousseff still has the option to veto the bill, one of the most controversial to pass Brazil’s congress in recent years. The bill was supported by some of her party’s senators and members of its multi-party coalition, even though the president had previously said she would veto earlier versions of the law that contained provisions perceived as too lenient on farmers who have cleared woodlands for agriculture.

Fresh from scheduling the semi final at the most inappropriate time there is no let up in the buffoonery.

The POD publisher’s philosophy dictates that the author not only knows best how to sell himself and his book, but, more often, the publisher has neither the understanding nor the where-with-all to actually carry out the task of marketing both author and book. If you went down to Quickprint and got your latest college thesis copied a few times, would you then ask the guy at the photocopier to sell your thesis to your college professor for your next PHD exam submission? I applaud the POD publisher’s who develop a relationship with their authors to the point where they understand them enough to actually even attempt to aid and help them market their own book. And, believe it or not, there are a few!

Emma and Josh have such different reactions to knowing about their future and the fact that they have the ability to change it by seeing their Facebook updates. Emma becomes increasingly consumed and frazzled with what she was finding out while Josh went about everything more cautiously. I sort of understand why Emma was so obsessed with her future and making sure it was perfect and that she was happy but the thing is, with Facebook updates it only shows a snippet of the person’s life so you don’t really get a whole picture.
4. Storyline – The game feels a little like a single-player game with multiplayer options. This isn’t a bad thing, really. You can solo much of your leveling experience, but there are also Group quests (2+ players) in every zone, plus your Flashpoints or “dungeon instances” to enjoy. Also, there are PVP areas where you will only fight other players.

My contract says I get 8.5 hours a day 5 days a week and I can give them 2 weeks notice for my vacation time. It does not mention unpaid leave. Am I being taken advantage of? I'm telling you this family has a ton of money. That isn't there problem, it's more the fact that they feel as though they owe me nothing. I still have to pay bills and I work another job part time. So I do not have time to make up overtime hours for them. They hired me, they should pay me. Right?

Um, yeah. Like that’s something I would do! I am grateful that I have never had to deal with such a situation. When Mary discovers that one of the aged crooks is carrying an illegal weapon, she confiscates it and tucks it in her purse. Forgetting for the moment that I don’t carry a purse, having a gun tucked away in a handbag where it might accidentally go off is not high on my list of priorities. (Though I would be interested in firing a gun just once to see how it would feel. Strictly for research purposes, you understand.)

A competing study on women turns in a less rosy result - moderate female drinkers, that have recovered from breast cancer, are INCREASING their chances of getting breast cancer again.

I mentioned earlier that Christ’s appearances to His apostles would become less frequent. They would have to learn to carry on His work without Him. Christ appears to all the assembled disciples again eight days later (verse 26). He targets Thomas immediately, asking him to investigate His wounds for himself (verse 27). Note that Thomas is the only one who said he would not only need to see but place his finger in the wounds. Christ is, in effect, saying, ‘Your friends didn’t need to touch Me in order to believe, yet you do. Don’t insist on conducting your own proof, just have faith!’ Thomas was guilty of a) not believing Jesus’s prophecies, b) mistrusting what the disciples told him and c) placing himself above Our Lord by challenging Him. This isn’t too far removed from asking God and His Son for ’signs’ or ‘wonders’. We saw the High Priests do this in Matthew 16:1-12, but some churchgoers and ordained today are also guilty of this. Indeed, the other disciples recognise Thomas’s sin; they are ashamed for him and somewhat discouraged by his open scepticism. Remember, they are still absorbing the significance of what has happened over the past few weeks.

In CJ and mine's break he told me that he got scared. I asked him scared of what he couldn't answer me entirely. The words swam in a sea of "I don't know's". Was he scared that he found someone he could have a future with? It seems that these next steps are terrifying the hell out of him yet when we met it was for commitment. We both agreed we were looking for a serious relationship. Tho we seem to be buckling under the pressure of it. I'm not sure how to deal with his fear and it's making me scared of things... I'm trying to be there but it doesn't seem to be working. I've chosen to just let him be and let him deal with it on his own in his own head but I feel like I'm not being a good girlfriend by not helping but that's what he wants? I'm at a loss...

Those 12 men – including Matthias – had seen the Lord doing all amazing things; they had seen, ate, slept, prayed, travel and walked along with Jesus Christ and they knew well that He was the Messiah. At the moment of trial, they fled, they scattered. What was that that happened so they did gather again and went all around the lands and taught the Word of God, the Good news? They saw with their own eyes the Lord arrested, tortured, crucified, dead and buried. What happened that changed their minds? What happened that gave them so much strength and stamina to move endlessly and preach and teach, till the day of their physical death?

Every now and again it's good to stop, breathe, think, and then act. This next period of activity in the studio, namely getting five LARGE canvasses ready for the Adur Arts Trail in June, is the biggest amount of artwork I've done to date. That's pretty daunting in itself, and I want to be well prepared so that when I get to the actual creativity phase, I'm free to explore knowing that I've laid all the groundwork properly.

When we suffer with trials and grief and hurt so many times we end up blaming God, or people around us, and questioning a God of love. But how can God purify and refine us without first a painful crushing of the 3,200 tons of waste in our lives, separating the hurts and sins and junk and idols in our lives? If we are to reach our full potential and be a blessing to the very God that found us deep in those depths (and you are or were in those depths, whether you realise it or not), we need God to put us though a painful furnace to burn off the chaff and metals and leave a pure and refined beautiful and so valuable piece of gold!

Other things happened while my family lived in the house – some very easily explained, some not. My older brother left home abruptly one night and joined the Army. We didn’t see him for two years. My sister had a near-fatal car accident and spent two weeks in ICU. My younger brother had more mishaps – medical, legal, personal – than about anyone I’ve ever known. And during those years, I developed extreme insomnia and rarely ever slept through the night.

Military intervention may or may not be the right idea, but people supporting KONY 2012 probably don’t realize they’re helping fund the Ugandan military who are themselves raping and looting away. If people know this and still support Invisible Children because they feel it’s the best solution based on their knowledge and research, I have no issue with that. But I don’t think most people are in that position, and that’s a problem.
I have a very interesting book and deck coming my way – the HEXEN 2.0 Tarot by Suzanne Treister. As a preamble to that, on the advice my friend Paul Nagy, I purchased the initial groundwork for this project, the book HEXEN2039, also by Suzanne Treister. Quite frankly, it is going to take me some time to understand the work that this incredible artist is doing. We are not talking “pretty pictures” here, we are talking work that is presented in multi-media format, with a very distinctive foundation. In 1995 Treister created a fictional alter ego by the name of Rosalind Brodsky. Rosalind is just as normal as the rest of us – a delusional time traveler who thinks that she is working at the Institute of Militronics and Advanced Time Interventionality (IMATI) in the twenty-first century.

Not long after Bugaboo finished her project, Beanie ambled out of the girls’ room, having tired of both solitude and Lincoln Logs, and decided to brush Smudgie and read a couple of board books on the couch. I love that she reads to Smudgie. Bugaboo disappeared and, after a quick stop to make sure she hadn’t fallen into the commode again, I poked my head into the girls’ room to see if she was, perhaps, napping, as the house was unnervingly quiet, even taking into account the sleeping boys. There sat our oldest daughter, playing with her sister’s dinosaurs and her own Strawberry Shortcake cafe, pretending a family of giant lizards had dropped by for cakes and milkshakes. I believe Orange Blossom (bottom left) probably fainted from fright.

Although he does not use the terminology of the EDA, Thurow’s article is very definitely a contribution to the burgeoning literature on this topic. As we saw in part one, he focuses specifically on the implications of so-called by product theories of religious belief formation. According to these theories, religious beliefs are by-products of cognitive faculties that have evolved for other purposes. The classic example being the HADD-theory, which maintains that belief in divine agency is the product of a hyperactive agency detection device.

The poppy is a symbol of Remembrance, with thanks to the poem Flanders Fields by John McCrae. McCrae wrote this poem during World War I after being witness to the death of a friend. Poppies flourished in the soil on Flanders' field were the war dead are buried. Due to this, poppies have become the most noted symbol of Remembrance I know. We buy our poppies every year and wear them with pride as a sign that we pause to remember and think about all the brave people who have risked everything for us to be able to live the way we do. Here I've found a video with the poem being recited.

From the standpoint of ordinary consciousness, separateness seems to be a basic part of the human condition. Most human beings experience themselves as egos trapped inside their own mind-space, observing a world which seems to be ‘out there’, on the other side of their skulls. As a result, the normal human state is one of aloneness. We’re always onlookers rather than participants. We can communicate with other people by speaking, writing or gesturing, but they will never be able to truly know us, or to share our thoughts and feelings. Our inner being will always be sealed off from them.

I also needed food, like, immediately. Then came the happy realisation that soba noodles only take 4 minutes to cook. So easy, so creamy, so perfect. And it only took 10 minutes of barely-thinking to make it happen. I want to eat this every day, forever. I turned right around and made it again for dinner. Definitely a keeper.
If you live in the East Bay, near San Francisco, Viharo hosts free double-features of various b-movies. These tiki-bar get-togethers are called Chillville, and take place on the third Monday of every month at the Forbidden Island Tiki Lounge in Alameda, where Viharo dispenses, along with his b-movie knowledge and wit, giveaways and prizes. The show starts around 7:30 p.m. (it's best to get there at least an hour earlier for decent seating).

With Pep Guardiola ending his managerial career at the Camp Nou will lead to unedifying speculation over the manager’s future plans; no doubt they still involve seeing out his contract. Hints this morning that despite his previously stated preference to remain at the club’s Academy, Steve Bould is Arsène’s Assistant once Pat Rice retires. If it isn’t Bould, Lehmann (unlikely) or Adams (possible) are mentioned; the Dream Candidate of Dennis Bergkamp is nowhere to be seen, in print at least.
I've gotten laundry going, and I'll vaccum as soon as I throw the tennis ball down the hallway as many times at it takes to wear Abby out so I can pick up her toys (yes, we are talking about the dog and yes she has that many toys). I could do homework but with 2 weeks of class left I'm over my Masters program and don't feel the need to be a good student and manage my time well. What a great example that is for my high school'ers.

I argued that it was silly for (students who were presumably) christians to get upset by someone asserting that the (supernatural) Jesus is fictional. After all, this is what practically every jew, muslim, hindu, buddhist, atheist, and agnostic in the school believes. More importantly, I argued that the school was wrong to punish Shott for class disruption caused by other students. Shott was following the rules. The idea that a student could be so upset over the assertion that their religion is untrue that they would cause a classroom disturbance, and that a school administrator could put the responsibility for such immaturity on Jeff Shott, and punish him for asserting an unpopular opinion, is outrageous. This sort of issue is exactly what free speech is about.

It came right on time. I need to find a way to deal and cope with my stress and past aggression’s in a different manner cause it is starting to physically kill me. I am finally letting go of all the drama and anguish and people in my world that only have their best interest at heart. Bye Bye!!!! I’m done…..I can take no more…I am deleting internet sites, changing phone numbers, I am done…Might even change my email address.A person can only take so much. When you start to realize that you need to put you first over everyone else is when you start to win. I am my priority now. My family is being really supportive through all of this medical crisis and is going to take a class with me on EFT (Tapping) we will see how that goes, my first class with my mom is today so I will write you or update you later tonight on how that went and explain further on what it actually is…..until later adios…

Whatever you may call it (stew, bisque, cream-of, gazpacho, broth, goulash, chowder, olio – am I forgetting anything?) a soup’s basic make-up consists of hearty ingredients married by the steeping process inside of a broth. Homemade broth is crucial for taste and I am entirely in favor of making and freezing my own. After stir fry night (left over asparagus stalks, onion skins, celery roots and leaves, ginger peel, etc) or maybe 5 left over cobs from your BBQed corn… I throw everything in a stock pot filled with water and herb clippings and let it boil down for no less than three hours. (Meat eaters, left over bones are your best friend.)
If this mothering thing were any harder…..God would equip me to do it, I suppose.

A wilderness survival weekend involves, as the name implies, going out deep into the wilderness and...well...surviving. No trails, just open wilderness. You go out empty-handed - no tents, no sleeping bags, no backpacks, no food. Only a canteen of water and a pocket knife, are allowed (I cheated a little and carried a small first aid kit and a Forest Service two-way radio just in case - since they are just boys, and the program is called wilderness survival, I thought it might be good to make sure everyone actually survived).

But Republicans largely held their rhetorical fire in the hours after Mr. Obama’s arrival in Afghanistan was made public.
I had the kind of day today that every collector surely dreams about - and it has left me on a high after a rather dull week. In fact, I had been worried about my typewriter-finding mojo lately; I found myself antsy for something thrilling to come my way, and as fate would have it, today was my lucky day. Nothing earth-shattering, nothing ultra-rare, but a big enough deal that I think March 10, 2012, will go down in my typewriter-collecting history as A Very Special Day.

Grabbing a seat at Latte, I tried some tasty eggs and whipped-off three free postcards to pass the time. Tani called to announce he’d gotten off the train and could come meet me. “Where are you?” I asked, excited to find him up the street. “I’m at 116th and Broadway,” he replied, “right by Columbia University.” He’d taken the #1 instead of the #2 or #3 as I’d written down. But, as per usual, he couldn’t read my chicken scratch so he copied the directions in his own hand. “I forgot that part,” he said. Feeling anger well-up inside, I walked the way I had just come.

The promo text, about the death of Arizona rancher Robert Krentz on the Arizona-Mexico border, is the next clinker. Brewer declares throughout the book that Krentz was killed by an illegal trespasser (Brewer-speak for undocumented immigrant). No one has ever been indicted for this murder, but Brewer’s lie proved useful in fomenting hatred for anyone who tried to cross the border fromMexico.
In this way, possessing a cover from incidents of all varieties is essential for every business manager. It is recommended to obtain facts with regards to all these items whilst a specialist advisor is quoting commercial insurance product. This could help save every company owner from unneeded hassle later on. On the other hand, disregarding it in the interests of conserving a handful of dollars could cost them fairly dearly.

On days when I go under 1,800 it helps me to keep the average on days when I go over. I like the idea of averaging 1,800 a day because there is less stress on days when you do go over. If I know I don’t want to go over 12,600 calories in a week (1,800 a day) and I am sitting at 8,000 for Mon-Fri, I know that if the weekend has me eating higher calories than normal I don’t have to stress about ruining my whole week. I am still right on plan.

Usually it takes some work to convince me to arrest a person for misdemeanors on a holiday, But he managed. He got locked up for crossing a police line, and his wife, who doesn’t drive, was taken to the nearby hospital by one of my officers.

I decided this was my opportunity to be mom, handling this as I would with my own kids. I wrapped Ankle Biter up in his towel and offered him a place to sit on my lap to warm up. We snuggled and talked for a while. He was feeling frustrated because he couldn’t go in the water by himself (since the pool was too deep and he can’t get his ears wet) like he can in the ocean when he goes there with his mom. I’m sure his frustration was only compounded by the fact that he could tell his dad wasn’t exactly happy either. We talked about it a bit, and I assured him that soon he would be big enough to go in the pool all by himself, just like my girls. I was calm, compassionate, and loving. I talked to him like I would talk to my own girls in the same situation. And for really the very first time in almost three years, I allowed my heart to open and felt “motherly” toward him.
After the president’s departure, Panetta, once known as a liberal House Democrat from California, began to morph into a gnarl-faced Dr. Strangelove with every utterance of war, enemies, threats, death and destruction as he touted U.S. military dominance and its ability to “decisively prevail in any conflict.’

My address is shown on both my blogs and I would also really appreciate if you could get the info out to as many quilters as possible so we can get the quilts ready while they are doing their recovery. I will be investigating help from a transport company to deliver the quilts to some local ladies who will give them out to the people affected and I prefer this to delivering to a general donation area where they could be "lost" among other donations.
Her abusive husband comes after her, chokes her, she manages to fire off a warning shot upward to stave him off (when she would have been fully justified to fire it at him instead of away from him) — she gets arrested (with a quickness for defending herself in her own home) and is facing up to 20 years in prison. If history serves us, she’ll get every second of them. Or not, because this is a high profile case out of the thousands that have gone under the national radar and for which no telling who is sitting in prison right now and should not be there.

However this stuff I was about to neck firmly sits in the premium end of the market. Premium meaning “actually made from apples” rather than flavoured corn syrup. Nowt against fermented flavoured cord syrup, ethanol is ethanol in my view and cheap cider is usually the only cider I actually like. Unlike beer where I do like most beers, whether expensive authentic imported stuff, pongy cask ale, keg bitter or cold fizzy delicious cooking lager. I like ‘em all but being cheap I neck the cheap stuff. With cider I’ve never much liked the proper “real cider” stuff, considering it “minging” and full of dead rats, and can only really neck the chilled fizzy variety.
I look around me at all the ways God is evident in my life…the health needs being met, the love of family and friends, how He has a way of taking situations where you see no way out, and shining through them in amazing ways. I look at those things and say, “See? See what I’m hoping in? My God shall supply all my needs…just like He always does!” Just like the picture above…even in the darkness that may be surrounding me for the moment, I can see God still spinning His beautiful colors as He works the details out, and I know all is well.

day is honoured in the Liturgy by what is called Saint Mark’s Procession. The term, however, is not a correct one, inasmuch as a procession was a privilege peculiar to April 25 previously to the institution of our Evangelist’s feast, which even so late as the sixth century had no fixed day in the Roman Church. The real name of this procession is The Greater Litanies. The word Litany means Supplication, and is applied to the religious rite of singing certain chants whilst proceeding from place to place in order to propitiate heaven. The two Greek words Kyrie eleison (Lord, have mercy on us) were also called Litany, as likewise were the invocations which were afterwards added to that cry for mercy, and which now form a liturgical prayer used by the Church on certain solemn occasions.

How is it that designers truly believe that emaciated, doe eyed, mussed hair models are the best ways to advertise their products? And by products, I mean their ridiculously over the top clothes, shoes, make-up, and accessories. All of the ads were exactly the same. Every advertisement showcased a hungry-looking, he/she with too much make-up, ridiculous hair, ridiculous hair, and the same vacant look in every single picture which included big eyes looking off into space with "seductively" parted lips. Missing from all these lovely pictures? Smiles. Not one. Not even an ironic smile. Everyone looked mad or sad.
On January 23, 2007, Bartee filed a motion for DNA testing in the 175th State District Court in Bexar County. On June 18, 2007, the district court granted Bartee’s motion and ordered that DNA tests be conducted on the crime scene evidence. After reviewing the test results, the court determined that the evidence did not exonerate Bartee because the DNA profiles developed from the blood and hair samples were consistent with the victim’s profile. Consequently, the convicting court rejected Bartee’s appeal and upheld the capital murder conviction. Bartee appealed the trial court’s finding to the Court of Criminal Appeals, but his appeal was dismissed as untimely on March 16, 2011.

Mine is an easel card, for which I used the cute Aviary set and the Thoughts and Prayers set for the branch. The sentiment is from Teeny Tiny sentiments. I inked the word 'mother' (you can see the full sentiment on the inside of the card) using my Rose Red marker and punched it out using the Jewellery Tag punch, one of my favourite punches, along with the little flower from the Itty Bitty Punch set. The flowers were embellished with adhesive half-pearls.

This movie did have one scene that I found truly disturbing. At one point the protagonists are in a butcher shop, and a resurrection machine is turned on to bring all the dead animals back to life. Chicken wings flapping, duck heads quacking, and I’m pretty sure at one point a re-animated liver attacking Roger Mortis. There’s also a headless, gutted and skinned cow that comes charging into the fray. This is the only scene that really struck me as horror or zombie-esque. With a few small tweaks, it definitely could have fit into a Sam Raimi film in a pinch.

Now I’ve heard the arguments, especially from the Society of Authors, about this being the best deal for the author. But that assumes we have no choice, and we do. We have a choice about not being digitized without agreement or arrangement. And I’ve agreed not to. Google says the author receives 64% of whatever profit is earned from their digitization and they think that’s fair. Most e-book publishers give the author up to 85% of the profits and you just know that Google will do anything to make sure the author gets as little as possible probably using net rather than gross profits.

I admit, it is a bit strange. I mean, how do all these artists that live here get their “art supply on”? The sad truth is, we’re in competition with the likes of Dick Blick and Michael’s.

Caroline next, my second time seeing them, and i can pay them the highest compliment: i don't think of them as my friend's band. They are a legit band, playing around town, doing the deal, trying to get shows, practicing a lot. They sounded fucking hot last night, (Backspace has pretty sweet sound, i gotta say), with the guitars pleasantly piercing, along with the drummers falsetto battle-cry between songs. I love their dreamy j-pop drift, and their twitchy thrash. I could do without the powerpoppunk emo posturing, but that was after my time, and everybody likes a ballad. I think their tongue is pretty firmly in cheek with their posturing, i still fucking hate it, but i forgive them, and i like 98% of their material. Go see them live. Often.
