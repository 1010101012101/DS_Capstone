After the ultrasound which took twenty painstaking minutes of me holding the upper body while Bry held her legs. Maeve screamed as they checked her from positions on her both her back and stomach. CHoP is a teaching hospital, and unfortunately we had the new resident in radiology who was not that familiar with the ultrasound machine. The tech spent a lot of time talking the resident through the ultrasound all while Maeve cried and then sucked her pacifier. I believe if the regular tech had performed the ultrasound it may have been about a third faster. But, docs need to learn somewhere, right?
Things I have learned this week:
Well, this is it for me for today. I hope you've enjoyed my little sneak peek on what's to come tomorrow.
I have a million and one things running through my mind but can't seem to pull them out into the right words. I'm a jumbled mess. For just the tiniest little bit I tell myself "I can do this. I can wait. Its called patience. Its called everything I've ever wanted. I can't just give that up... I can't give up an opportunity like that... especially one I've longed for, for a while. Something that I know would make me become the happiest girl in the world. I can do this. Don't give up hope, but don't get your hopes up. If you never give it a chance you'll never know what could come of it." A little insight is good and maybe one day I can come up with a way to organize my thoughts.

But I waste so. Much. Time on it. Time that I should maybe be, oh, you know, editing. Because, "Oh, I think I'll just browse Pinterest for five minutes" turns into, "Oh my god!

Last night, The Boyfriend called me at work to let me know that my cousin Lucifer, he of the jail and prison stays (he's been exonerated, but I look for it to catch up someday) and substance abuse issues, had turned up on my front porch. The bad part is that The Boyfriend let him in. Lucifer is kind of like a vampire in that once he gets across the threshold, he's not leaving until he's ready to go. In this case, it was 8:45 this morning. He was so blotto that he hardly knew where he was or who he was, yet by sheer instinct, he ended up at my house. The local police have poured him out into my custody more than once, too, when they didn't want him driving the thirty-five miles to his parents' home.

In years past, I gather, Bossman would regularly ditch the old machinery to keep the fleet svelte. Clearly, the dive in business has delayed or cancelled his plans in that area. Trouble is that the competition - there are two or three good other outfits around now - are all running the 'L' model Lincoln Town Cars. With an extra six inches in back seat legroom, wider opening rear door and a raft of other specialized limousine features, these cars kill the standard models we drive. Especially as The Boss charges our clapped out crates at around the same money.
In a large bowl combine the yeast and water and let sit until it is foamy. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, oil, sugar, and salt. Add milk mixture to the yeast mixture and stir until combined. Add all the flour and stir until it forms a shaggy dough. Knead for 10 minutes. The finished dough should be smooth, feel slightly tacky, and spring back when poked. Return the dough to the mixing bowl and cover and let rise until doubled - about 1 hour in a warm spot. Place the dough onto a lightly floured counter and divide the dough into 8 pieces. Shape each piece of dough into a circle and place on a baking sheet. Let rise again until they are about the size of a hamburger bun - about 30 to 40 minutes. Melt the butter and brush it over the risen hamburger buns. Bake at 375 for 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden brown.
Yet there are those that believe that the ballot is thee answer, that nationalism must keep hammering at the gates, regardless of cost, yet I ask if nationalism was going to win, would it not have won some decades ago, when the people were less driven by self and consumerism not a living breathing entity, would not the peoples voice have resonated across the land, ending at Westminster. Yet it never came to be, individuals, much clever than this writer were side-lined, workers and the people forced into line and the body-politic lied to by successive governments, why it was not going to change the social fabric of society ,there was no cause for alarm, Britain would always be Britain, no need to worry. Today of course we see a different place, indeed ironically the Britain of the fifties seems an alien place, not solely because it is in the past but because it was almost entirely homogenous, the people more united crime not glamorised, by a frankly quite insane film industry and therefore controllable upon the street. The young respected who they were and where they came from and indeed they could play in peace and not sit huddled in bedrooms playing in cyberspace not permitted to roam free by anxious and quite terrified parents.
Wednesday I experienced something that I’m just now realizing was different, VERY different.
People say that in mixed marriages, one ideology usually dominates. One person in the relationship usually converts, either for personal reasons, outside pressure or convenience. As for me, I am going to change my subhead to “Can a vegetarian Jewish guy and a pescatarean desi girl live happily together?”

The wind veered later in the day and I got pretty wet hoisting and dousing sails while we beat into the wind. At some point in the day we passed through a strange stretch of coastal water where flies abound. I went below to prepare some lunch and was greeted by approximately thirty flies. They were swarming around the cabin in clusters. I hate flies. I hate any insect on the boat because there are too many hidden places where they can nest that I will never find. It disgusts me to think of various species colonizing deep in the bilge and crawling around while I sleep. Somehow the fly debacle escalated into full blown debauchery when I discovered most of them where mating. Somehow Swift Ranger had devolved into an ocean going brothel. Fortunately, the flies disappeared on their own after we had passed far enough south.

In fact, if you had invested in the Turkish model (that is, in the Turkish stock market) at the outbreak of the Arab revolts, you would have lost about half your money. If you leave your money in Turkey, you probably will lose the rest of it. Turkey is not a model. It is a bubble, and it is bursting, starting with the stock market and national currency. I am shorting Turkey not for any political motivation, but because the Turkish government economic policy is a clown show.’

Both Obama and Iraqi President Nuri al-Maliki conferenced via video and both are comfortable with this decision to move forward and the execution of doing so. Along with the plan of withdrawing soldiers from Iraq they will also not be sending more soldiers in. Some Georgia-based soldiers have announced that their division will not be deployed in December as scheduled. This to me is huge because my brother is in the army and hopefully he will stay in the United States for a long time now out of harm’s way. Though, I’m not 100% sure whether or not he will be deployed because he originally spent a year in Afghanistan not Iraq. The hope is still there though because they have already removed 100,000 troops from Iraq over the years and violence has remained relatively low. Hopefully this war will be over soon, but the fight against terrorism will always be there but maybe our approach will be a little more peaceful and less deaths will occur.
For a short while,
Friends, I am writing today to help support a very good cause, and to announce a wonderful crafty giveaway. Our design team member, Nikki, lost her mother in early December. I can't tell you how saddened we were to hear this news. While we didn't know her mother, we were extremely blessed to hear her amazing life story; one that Nikki shares with us on her blog.
I’m sure – at least, I hope – some of my readers believe in a literal six-day creation, in a literal exodus story exactly as it’s described, in a conquest narrative faithfully told in Joshua. If you do, the question that this series tries to answer will be a little easier for you. I don’t believe in those things; I don’t believe the Bible was trying to give us a strictly accurate history lesson the way we understand history in the 21st century. We’ve had plenty of discussions about this before. But it occurs to me that some people might object to the very premise of my introduction, in which I talk about whether the virgin-birth stories can “withstand the scrutiny.”

The silence from the police lasted until Fr. McCullough’s letter appeared in the Irish Times. Then, suddenly, he was phoned by an HET investigator who offered a meeting. When Fr. McCullough complained about the indifference shown by the RUC towards his brother, the HET man replied, according to Fr. McCullough: “……that he had never experienced sectarianism in the RUC or PSNI.”

Most of them don’t care about the 400 steel workers who lost their jobs in January. They think they should get on their bikes to find work.

For the first time since we even began to entertain the notion of a D/s relationship, my safety word hovered on my lips as I felt frightened. It was too painful this time, and I only realised half-way through that the trouble lay with me (a sensitivity of skin that I suffer from on occasion) and not with the force of Mein Herr’s strikes. I became so overwhelmed with it, and the fear that I would have to use the word (which would be almost like a betrayal of my trust in him), that I started to cry. Not something I am prone to during such events, and not a wave of emotions I ever intend on repeating.

Today is the Insecure Writers Support Group! When we flood the world wide web with our pathetic tears. Or hopefully not. Last month I shared about my eight-year-old daughter's inspirational writing habits. (She is, by the way, still at it. Just the other day she received a new diary and did she start writing about boys in it? No, she started writing a story called "The Adventures of Luthien and Dot" about her and her new baby cheetah stuffed toy. It also features some of the Thundercats.) But today, ah today! I am feeling a bit apprehensive myself and I'd like to share a little bit about what's worrying me.

And lastly, it is my opinion that Sessions, in his reactive frustration over this book, has resorted to the very fundamentalism of which he accuses Douthat: an “ideology that is unable to see past its own particular politico-cultural moment.” He believes that Douthat has created a thesis that has built-in “anti-contraceptivism” so deeply into it that if you take that away, his argument falls apart.

Chamille never did that. I'm not even sure that she can count by 2's, not that it really matters much because she can count change really fast in her own way. She did that yesterday too. She had a pile of change. Okay, here I go again trying to count my children's change... and she says "NO! You are going to mess me up in my counting. I have my own way of counting." So, she quickly divides up the coins in neat little piles of $.25 and counts them really fast and is done before I even begin to count and add each coin individually!

I’ve been married to my wife for 9 years. We are completely in love and do what married in-love couples do… but we don’t make out anymore. We kiss each other when we leave but it’s always just a simple peck. I read a study where couples who make-out have a healthier relationship and it’s something I’d like to test out. What are your thoughts on this?
For most of my life, and long after his own was over — for as long as there were people alive to attest to this amazing, gifted person, his integrity, character and life — to hear people unfailingly wax eloquent regarding his virtues, the moment his name was mentioned, has been a privilege enjoyed by few children. I was only six when he died, and now I, too, am old, but I retain the most vivid memories of him. Although, in my novel, ‘Tarnished Idols’ the romantic story itself is not true, I used him and his relationship with my sister and me, in my book. He really did speak Latin, and he really did teach himself to write shorthand, which is why, in his obituary, the Ficksburg News quoted one speaker as reflecting:
Then, seemingly out of the blue, Katie gets a mysterious job offer from Magic, Spells and Illusions, Inc. – a company that sells charms, spells and tricks of the trade to wizards and others in the magic community. To them, Katie’s ordinariness is an asset. Lacking any bit of magic, she can easily spot a fake spell, catch hidden clauses in customers’ contracts or detect magically disguised intruders. Suddenly, average Katie is very special, indeed, and her life is anything but normal.

But not all think like this. I bought a hammock some years back that came with assembly instructions and was surprised to see an image on an Amazonian woman reclining in a similar hammock breastfeeding a goat. I have no idea what the importers of the hammock where trying to promote but when I looked into the practice it turns out that some tribes are not adverse to breastfeeding animals. So clearly culture shapes what we find acceptable here but still it does seem very odd. I do have another image of a New Zealand woman breastfeeding her puppy but I think my point has been made.
All picks look to have a chance to play this year. The impacts, however, will be at the first three picks. Overall team speed was improved with those picks. Coples, who in 2010, played well outside, will be the LDE in the 3-4, and may move inside in the 4-3. I know, I know, motivation. The one thing, though, is that he had a heck of a situation with the agent scandal down at UNC, and dealt with a coaching change. Rex is a players coach, and will get the most out of this kid. He’ll open holes for the linebackers to make plays, which brings us to Demario Davis. Being billed as a younger Bart Scott by Rex, he should see some playing time. He’s fast, and can line up inside and outside which should help when facing Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez.

A week or two on a holiday with only your best friend is something you must experience (multiple times if possible) in your lifetime. No parents, no work, no responsibilities. Just you and your friend, taking an adventure or relaxation in a foreign country. Ideally you want to go for 2-3 months, and backpack through multiple cities and countries, but even a week or two in a beach location is fantastic.

A middle aged woman had come across his embalming table after expiring suddenly. She had been the picture of health one moment then gone the next, or so the gentleman who pronounced her dead thought. Back in those days determining whether, or not someone was dead was more assumption then actual science. Her condition was far better than the usually stiffs he received for preparation, their skin ashen, their muscles rigor-ed, but not her. Her skin was pale, but her muscles were still supple. His loins stirred at the sight of her. Now as I said he was a lonely old sod, so he took to doing things that he might not otherwise if he had live companionship. Some of the things he did might have been considered disrespectful, even a crime by societies standards, but from his view point no one was being hurt. He held off embalming her not wanting to smell the fluid on her skin, while he played with her.

One thing I really enjoy doing is offering my blog subjects out to people… just to see what people want to read but more importantly, what subjects people wanna know about.
God uses His sovereign power to encourage people to love each other, but He also allows us to make selfish choices that can tear us apart. God permits calamity so that we can experience His greatest gift – a free will. Without free will, you and I would be robots or lifeless, stuffed animals. Fortunately, God limits His power to let us make our own choices in life. Does your free will nullify God’s omnipotence? No, as Psalm 37:23 says, “The steps of a man are established by the Lord.” God is so powerful that He can allow you to choose and still work the outcome for His glory.
I look to all this stuff, the books, the magazines, the style sections and sites to open my eyes to how to do it better. Not just decorate, but create a home for my family and friends. When I see those rooms all lined up like shoebox dioramas on a schoolroom shelf, it makes me want to open my scissor and drag the blade along the fold; to set the house in order.
So, we have a total of 2.97 per book. I calculated that I can assemble the book in 2 minutes. And given a $15 an hour wage, this adds 50 cents to the process. I will overlook the cost of glue and staples, fuckups etc… just because I don’t feel like calculating half cents and such.
The gospel, thorough the power of the Holy Spirit, enables us to love. And love completely, without abandon, and without any thought of self. Josh often tells me that when he’s “good with God,” he’s “good with me.” He recognizes that his love for me is merely overflow from his relationship with the Lord.

That being said, as many of you know, there was a small subset of patients with DDF508 in the Phase III Kalydeco study that had a very large increase in FEV1 with the drug. Genes don't tell the whole story with this drug - as you see with many CF patients, their genes don't predict how healthy/unhealthy they are. Siblings, with the exact same CF mutations, have varying CF outcomes.

It has been plays like this, that have been becoming the topic of discussion in the hockey world.

Mercedes GP also tried an innovative F-Duct front wing last year. This was not driver controlled, but rather speed (pressure) sensitive. Stalling the wing above 250kph, this allowed the flexing wing to unload and flex back upwards at speed, to prevent the wing grounding at speed. But the effect altered the cars balance at high speed, and the drivers reportedly didn’t like the effect on the handling. I’ve heard suggestions that the solution isn’t planned for 2012.

Could I have been discriminated against because my Asperger's caused me to act in unexpected ways, and I was therefore excluded from a group I might otherwise have been welcomed into? Sure, that has undoubtedly happened, but I would not necessarily even know. If they didn't want me, that is enough for me. I don't want to be there either. I am very sensitive to that.
This is a clip of my favorite musical number from the movie. A dialogue coach hired by the studio to help Kelly’s character transition to talkies is not being taken seriously by Kelly and O’Connor. It’s hard to take your eyes off Kelly but check out O’Connor holding his own.

As much as I tried not judging the film because of what it is, I just thought it seemed too unreal. Even if you remove the dogs, there are a lot of things that shouldn’t even be possible, so no, I’m not giving the movie a pass. I can’t believe Lisa Kudrow and Don Cheadle signed up for this. I’m not a dog-person, so I really can’t recommend this to anyone except people who are. But if you’re interested, then my only tip for you is to lower your expectations.
Grandparents should also have rights of access after separation, but where possible to have access to coincide with the Parents Contact, but above all to be there to show support, stability and continuity to very young children.
So, my post for today is about taking my little man to get his pictures taken at Sears. It was a horrible experience and I was so disapointed in the pictures. He is so cute and his little outfits were so cute that I just do not understand how she could have possibly messed up but she sure did. She did not move the camera the entrie photo session...Tristan is only three months old so he is not going to move for her so she can get a good shot. The girl who was taking our pictures was also the cashier, so when anyone would come in to the portrait studio, she would have to leave us and go take care of the walk in customers. While this was going on Tristan was losing patience with the whole process....and he was quite cooperative when we arrived.

“When we stop expecting ourselves to be perfect, we’ll discover the beauty in ourselves.” -Melody Beattie
Yeah, she knows the woman I ain’t,
(Now, in fairness, of course he was not talking only about physical science. He was talking about the expressions of suffering, which include “fear, suspicion, jealousy, anger attachment, that all center on I. Self as the center.”) And then he spent a lot of time explaining that point. Bonnie has his excellent early tapes of the Four Noble Truths that he presented in England, with our favorite translator, that lays it all out beautifully. I watch those also whenever possible. So do listen to that, and then here is his current summation. Beautiful. Do remember the word Dharma has been, can be, translated as “truth,” and refers to reality as it is – and when we study the Dharma we are trying to figure out what reality is, so that we don’t increase suffering.)

23. Impatience. You know better, but sometimes you can’t help it. You want to get on with what seems to be coming your way. Uncertainty is not comfortable. Advice: Learn to live with the uncertainty, knowing that nothing comes to you until you are ready. Impatience is really a lack of trust, especially trust in your Higher Power. When you focus on the present, you will experience miracles — yes, even in traffic.
There was a time when just the thought of sex would get instant results. Unfortunately, that has passed, at home at least (have not gotten to try it out anywhere else!!), and something more is needed. So we have fallen back to good old male foreplay. She rubs my stomach, then slowly goes down until she awakens the beast!! Well, ok, it gets a little hard.
All it would take is to track down Sir Isaac’s descendants and ask them to revoke their famous ancestor’s lifetime of study. Singer-songwriter Juice Newton, whose 1981 smash “Queen of Hearts” hit number one on both pop and country charts, still tours and can currently be found playing at the municipal auditorium in Missoula, Montana. Recent Heisman Trophy winner Cam Newton of Auburn is busy in his Alabama dorm preparing for finals and the Jan. 10 BCS title game against second-ranked Oregon. I’m sure both would be amenable to refinements in the law that would give us all a good chuckle.
A couple of weeks ago, I had shared some of the progress our daughter had made in their baby nursery. She has done so much by herself...from the paper lanterns to the crib skirt to the painting shown in this post.

From the above it should be clear that Catholics – or, at least, sane Catholics – are cautious when it comes to mysticism. Central to Catholic mysticism is the idea of discernment or “the discernment of spirits.” Discernment is said to be a gift and acquired ability that enables one to differentiate supernatural experiences and abilities that come from God from those that do not.

And while clearing out the basement, recently, we also found the wood and nails “frame” that my dad used to bend the angel dolls’ wings into that particular shape. Unless I decide to use it to hang jewelry on, we’ll probably donate it. But it’s a fascinating contraption, and I wonder how many people would see it in a thrift store, and wonder what in the world it was used for?
One can be "organized" and still have "clutter" in their lives. What physically appears "organized" may actually be draining your energy if you no longer love it, for example. Clutter is not always about our physical "stuff," either. Clutter can show up in our relationships, our minds, our bodies, in our energy and in our inboxes! I've been learning a lot from Sue Rasmussen, a life coach whose motto is "Making Room for What Matters." As part of her "Clearing Out Day" for July (which is part of a larger 12-month program called Streamline Your Success), we focused on virtual clutter. I chose to work on my Gmail account.
Technically this is a very well written book. The continued use of the image of the veil and the use of the phrase “the valley of the shadow of death” invokes the Bible in a very significant way. I want to quote large parts of the text to you because they were so beautiful but I am going to limit myself to just a few:
Maybe harmonious relations can only be produced by approaching the prospect of becoming an expatriate alongside your children and seeing it as a journey taken undoubtedly together, despite the different emotions and experiences along the way. Let your children teach you whilst you are doing everything you can to help them in their new lives, and you will both find it
There was no special reason he thought so, but events had become so weird that he was not ruling anything out. He suggested that they find out if the chicken could read. If it could they would write a question for it, and it would pertain to something that occurred before they arrived at the cave. This would show them if the chicken had been intelligent before arriving at the cave, or not. He noticed that stalagmites did in fact look a lot like sharp fangs. He shuddered.

Jesus came to bring us peace. I think it was a powerful lesson in trust that the apostles went through on the Saturday so long ago as they waited for their messiah to be raised. You are faced with the same trust questions. Do you trust that God is in control even of this very situation? Do you trust that he works all things for your good (Romans 8:28)?

I really need to start making money online. I need to not be reliant on him. Every morning I dread waking him up. I know it is just one excuse after another and frankly I am just really tired of it. I am totally exhausted trying to get everyone to work so that we can pay bills the best we can. Trying my best to keep him motivated to what I know he doesn’t want to do. I don’t want to get up at 1 am. I don’t want to wake him and try to keep in focused everyday. I don’t want to do a lot of things. I especially don’t want to drive over 5 hours a day. Nor, do I like trying make sure all the checks go through the bank. (which doesn’t always work) I don’t want the pain in my stomach that I think is stress related that I can’t go see a doctor for because we don’t have the money for it. I don’t want the migraines that keep coming. I don’t want to feel this unloved feeling that I have felt from him for 10 years.
I’m inspired by teens who set out to right wrongs. At my school, just over ten years ago, a group of teens was bothered by the second-hand smoke at athletic events. In fact, one girl’s asthma was so bad that she couldn’t even attend games and support her classmates. Andbutso, they did something about it. Several petitions, speeches, and presentations to school board members later, smoking was banned on school campuses across the county.

All my life all I’ve ever wanted to be was a writer. And the hardest thing about being a writer is what the art demands. A writer is a lone wolf. And most of the time, being a writer feels like you are chasing an invisible something in the middle of pitch black forest.

If you've made a batch of lemon curd, try spreading maybe 4 tablespoons across the crust with a pastry brush or the back of a spoon. Arrange the mango pieces evenly in the crust -- it's okay if you don't have quite enough to fill it. (If you didn't use the lemon curd, you could use a couple tablespoons of the mango syrup to help fill in any gaps.) Spangle the tart with the berries, then fold the loose edges of the crust over the filling. It doesn't need to look perfect -- rustic and tasty is what you're going for with this thing.
In the Gospel of Matthew (25) he tells his surprised disciples, that when you are meeting the poor, you are meeting him. They protest. "Lord, when was it that we saw you hungry and gave you food, or thirsty and gave you something to drink? And when was it that we saw you a stranger and welcomed you, or naked and gave you clothing? And when was it that we saw you sick or in prison and visited you?' And the king will answer them, 'Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me."

Practice daily cleansing of your auric field and chakra systems. Doing a cleanse in the shower each morning is a perfect way to start each day. Knowing where your energy field is at all times is important. Set it consciously. If you are encountering a lot other people from all walks of life during your day, bring it closer to your body. This lessens what you pick up from others. If you are going somewhere where you want to be tuned into everything, make it larger. Remember to clear it when you are done to not carry around so much of stuff that belongs to others. Do regular clearing meditations to release any cords we have with others, or they have with us. These are a few tips that can make a difference in how you experience the world. Find groups of like minded and like energy people to hang out with, at least a few times a month. Find a support group who is on a similar path to your own. Know we will always be on different paths while we are still climbing the same mountain.

He stepped out of the car and looked skyward. It’s about forty-five degrees, sky full of stars, no clouds, but snow,” he thought. He peeled off his fingerless gloves before reaching into the air to catch a flake as it descended. He looked at it, but light was scarce. He checked up to see that the nearest street light was four houses away, then glanced again up into the starry night. He watched star after star disappear as if a black blanket was being pulled across the night sky, eventually leaving an empty ceiling. He blindly reached through the open car window while watching where the stars had been only seconds ago. He clicked on the spotlight that was mounted just above his side view mirror and held his palm in front of the beam.

Tomato Basil Bread This month Breads are on sale so I thought I would try the bread that I have in stock. It sounded like it would be okay, not a favorite but I wanted to try it. So I mixed it up (as always super easy) put it in my bread pan and baked for the desired time plus a little plus a little more. My oven isn't that great, it came with the house. In the end the bread was very dense and well my allergies are acting up and it just didn't work with the taste in my mouth. Sorry can't give it a great recommendation, I will try it again to see if it was me or the allergies that it wasn't working for.

“In love one should exercise economy of intercourse. None of us can love for ever. Love will be stronger and will last longer if there are impediments of its gratification. If a lover is prevented from enjoying his love by absence, difficulty of access, or by the caprice or coldness of his beloved, he can find a little consolation in the thought that when his wishes are fulfilled his delight will be intense. But love being what it is, should there be no hindrances, he will pay no attention to the considerations of prudence; and his punishment will be satiety. The love that lasts longest is the love that is never returned.”

The first page talks about choice, that our life is really all about choice and the power we have to live the life we imagine. We can whine about circumstance, or cry about bad luck......but the choice to take and make.......the life we seek, is ours.

Do you like the sound of sleigh bells? I think it has something magical and whimsical to it and there is just nothing like the unique soft jingling noise they make. Whenever I hear them I instantly think of a sleigh ride through the mountains in a starry winters night, covered in thick blankets and lots and lots of snow. I can hear the horses stamping and snorting and I can almost feel the wind in my face.....lol yes you can say I really love them :-) I also have them decorated everywhere in my house through winter season. Even though I'm living here in Florida now where there's no snow at all ;-)

Plot Turn 2 - Resolve to do something - The power is in you (your MC)
You all write about these amazing spiritual spaces where people are coming to doubt, to question, to heal. Where they and you and we all come and be and receive the body of Christ. Spaces where people don’t have to have all the right answers and do it all the same way. I believe in those spaces, was raised in a house that valued those spaces, am attempting to live an honest, communal life where I really and truly do community with my brothers and sisters in Christ, and the neighbors who are perhaps far from Him (Am I still allowed to say that in these spiritual safe places?).
I believe that the most responsible thing an artist can do when depicting violence is to look at it from all sides. I think it's interesting that the most recent incarnations of the James Bond character were allowed some real humanity. Bond is tormented by his life of violence. So, while the modern Bond films are more violent than they used to be I believe they are far more responsible in presenting real consequences.
Then it was off to yum chan at a omni place with Toby's family on his father side. It was nice to meet his cousins and uncles/aunts but there was limited food options for me.

3 hrs and 2 ultrasounds later it's decided that his head cannot dilate my cervix efficiently because he won't stop sucking his thumb.

Nevertheless, I believe that everybody has a right to use anything they’d like as money. If some people prefer government paper money to gold and silver, that is their prerogative. I would only ask that my right to choose my own money be respected. Why should’t individuals be allowed to make contracts in gold? Why does paper and electronic money have to be accepted as “legal tender for all debts, public and private”?
I pulled in to Thom's place, gave him a hug and got my home as level as I could. He proudly showed me the 30 amp connection that he'd had installed by his high school friend Kyle. Kyle works as an electrician in Ferndale. I don't know if he has completed his apprenticeship yet. I plugged in and we threw the breaker and it immediately tripped. Strange. We checked everything, then I finally checked the power at the outlet - 240 volts! For some reason he thought a 30 amp outlet needed 240 volts. I am lucky the motorhome isn't burnt to the ground. As it is, I had to replace my microwave and the controller for my electric blanket is trash. All of the other electrical safety devices did their job. I normally check the polarity and power output before I plug the coach in to service panels at RV parks, but I gave Kyle the benefit of the doubt (he is an electrician) and almost paid dearly for it. Lesson learned.

The poster that sits on his dresser is a vintage poster that belonged to my brother. I framed it in a red IKEA frame. The lamp is from IKEA as well, and there are a few treasure boxes. One came from Hong Kong when my brother was there for work, another he made at a pirate party, and another came from Ali's son, Noah. The owl was a gift from my friend Nicole at Home for Hire. I painted it glossy red, because each of my kids needs an owl in their room! And tissues, of course, because it is allergy season.
The government are to bump up electricity bills to subsidise new building of energy sources it deems to be low carbon. This isn't just developing new technologies that need investment to get up to scale. The phrasing - we can only assume deliberately - makes no mention of the word 'renewable'.

You lie, a small knuckle on my white bed; lie, fisted like a snail, so small and strong at my breast. Your lips are animals; you are fed with love. At first hunger is not wrong. The nurses nod their caps; you are shepherded down starch halls with the other unnested throng in wheeling baskets. You tip like a cup; your head moving to my touch. You sense the way we belong. But this is an institution bed. You will not know me very long. The doctors are enamel. They want to know the facts. They guess about the man who left me, some pendulum soul, going the way men go and leave you full of child. But our case history stays blank. All I did was let you grow. Now we are here for all the ward to see. They thought I was strange, although I never spoke a word. I burst empty of you, letting you see how the air is so. The doctors chart the riddle they ask of me and I turn my head away. I do not know. Yours is the only face I recognize. Bone at my bone, you drink my answers in. Six times a day I prize your need, the animals of your lips, your skin growing warm and plump. I see your eyes lifting their tents. They are blue stones, they begin to outgrow their moss. You blink in surprise and I wonder what you can see, my funny kin, as you trouble my silence. I am a shelter of lies. Should I learn to speak again, or hopeless in such sanity will I touch some face I recognize? Down the hall the baskets start back. My arms fit you like a sleeve, they hold catkins of your willows, the wild bee farms of your nerves, each muscle and fold of your first days. Your old man's face disarms the nurses. But the doctors return to scold me. I speak. It is you my silence harms. I should have known; I should have told them something to write down. My voice alarms my throat. "Name of father—none." I hold you and name you bastard in my arms. And now that's that. There is nothing more that I can say or lose. Others have traded life before and could not speak. I tighten to refuse your owling eyes, my fragile visitor. I touch your cheeks, like flowers. You bruise against me. We unlearn. I am a shore rocking off you. You break from me. I choose your only way, my small inheritor and hand you off, trembling the selves we lose.

But although some people still receive their pay strictly based on the work they do (ie: I do a job for you, you pay me a certain amount), many of us receive salaries. If I am paid a salary and I do not do some of my assigned work, I am not typically docked pay. Typically I am reprimanded. If my work does not improve, I lose my job and all pay. If I work on a salary and I do extra work or do my work especially well, I rarely receive additional compensation. Even those who are paid specifically for the work they do find that, if they decide not to perform their contracted service, they are likely not to have the same opportunity again later. Most of us moms work very hard for no pay at all!

Such was this case with this bread in my kitchen. It was kind of a busy day when I tackled this bread, and and the process of making it took me from 10am in the morning to 1am the next morning. It became an exercise in me waiting for the dough and the dough waiting for me!
On the other hand, an e-reader will one day be useless. Like my papaw's eight track player or those giant "mobile phones" that mom used to carry.

The trail wound to and fro, the brush dense, the fog almost material as it clung to the spruce needles. The path grew thin and sparse, barely enough room to place one foot in front of the other, with the way the underbrush encroached on the trail. I stumbled on twigs and logs as branches clawed my cheeks and pulled my hair. I began to trip, reaching out for something to hang onto. I fell, my hand
Bette made a roaring comeback with her role as Margo Channing in "All About Eve" (1950), and she received her eighth Academy Award nomination. Her career was resuscitated again in 1962 with "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" Soon after, Bette began her second career as a horror maven and continued to welcome new opportunities with television appearances. In 1987, Bette played a blind woman in "The Whales of August," co-starring Lillian Gish.
A dark take on America during the Cold War, narrated by Rorschach, who sports an ink blot mask from a Rorschach test. Playing homage to a film noir, he is intent on solving why America’s superheroes are being mysteriously killed off.
Why, my soul, are you downcast?
For whatever reason the goalkeeper felt it necessary to make a confession, not so much to Luke, but to his lens. He admitted to being the manager of BTC Reserves, and continued to stress that far from being a 'ringer,' he was registered legitimately for Durley, who are his local team, having signed for them at the beginning of the season. Quite what the chain of events leading him to simultaneously becoming BTC reserves' manager was a complete mystery to me.
I think I need to listen to my gut-feeling this time. For real. If I don’t feel comfortable with T anymore, then what’s the point in going.
There were some roadblocks and detours on this journey, as I expected, starting with the language barrier that made it impossible to follow related tweets and Facebook posts by everyday Arabs—rather than media and established blog outlets–as I had hoped. But with every new turn there was something else to be learned, new questions and complexities were added, and every loss returned a gain.

It is very important to fix these salaries at an appropriate level. If it is fixed too high, the fixed base element may give partners too much security and may also become a disproportionately high focus of attention in the compensation setting round. If fixed too low, it can become somewhat meaningless. The experience of a number of firms is that the aggregate level of such base salaries should be targeted to be around half of the total compensation package, thus leaving a realistic proportion of total compensation subject to both performance related and proprietorship aligned factors.
First I'd like to say that I think about you a lot. I really do mean a lot. Whenever I see a rider on the road, I pass beautiful scenery on the highway, or even passing a Cycle Gear...I think of you. I'm really sorry that I haven't given you the attention you deserve. You've done so much for me. You challenged me, gave me courage, and showed me a good time. The last few months have been tough. I moved to San Jose and lost my usual practice lots...it's getting cold outside...you've been cooped up in the garage forever and now you probably won't even start! I miss you a ton and I'd like to make it up to you. How about this weekend I give you some fresh oil and gas, and we take a short ride around town? It won't make up for the 3 months we've lost, but I think it's a start. What do you think?

Poor girls, neglected.
Goin back to the other thing. So, I'm really weird, very sensible. I just want to cry if I don't get atention. I think sometimes I am unimportant and people feel like if they don't talk to me, I'll be okay. I won't. I need attention sometimes, I need someone to tell me to do things because they want me with them.

#43 Roger McDowell - The best card in the pack is right below this, so feel free to skip if you'd like. But McDowell isn't a bad card to get either - his biggest years seem to be his first 2, when he almost won Rookie of the Year and then won the World Series. But even if the rest of his career wasn't as good, that's a pretty good 2 years!

In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg whites, milk, 2 Tbsp parmesan, and 1/4 tsp salt. Stir in bread cubes and let soak for about 10 minutes (more or less depending on how hard your bread is). Stir in the cooled mushroom mixture and the shredded cheese. Pour into the baking dish and top with remaining parmesan. Bake until golden, about 45 minutes. let stand for 10 minutes before serving.

It was amazing to be able to talk to other people – whose stories ranged from eerily (and sadly) similar to mine, to wonderfully optimistic for me (in that they gave me an insight into a healthier and more enjoyable future). It was such a relief to be able to discuss ghastly symptoms and sucky quality of life with people who truly understood. Who got it. Who simply knew what I meant when I talked about how this disease – and the failure to diagnose it – has compromised and limited my life and my achievements. Whilst everyone agreed that the test I am about to have is horrible to endure, there were also people there who’d had it and had obviously survived!
This is what my design wall looks like these days - I love how bright and colorful and full of different blocks it is. I'm simultaneously working on 3 different quilts, plus that lonely teapot block really needs to be finally used in some project. I've never worked on so many quilts at once before and I'm enjoying it a lot.
Jessi: IN HONOR is a road trip story that begins with a pair of concert tickets and a mistaken last request, and ends with truths discovered on the road.
On the way out as you can see we got a picture of another server’s shirt, to represent where we were. I even shared the story with him about his co-worker and he thought it to be quite amusing as well. Well kinda funny and maybe a little embarrassing as I mentioned I would blog about it. Any who he was a sport about it, and I am too. It’s not really about bad service, because hell I sometimes don’t have the best attitude in the morning. Its more about taking those perfect opportunities to really sell who you are to an audience who is hungry for the presentation. If someone ever asks you to explain what you do, be sure to put the passion behind the answer. That’s your time to shine!
In the last five years or so, and particularly since the Bloomberg administration's PlaNYC was introduced in 2007, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation has been testing out human-reclamation plans, the most recent of which would fill in one of the basins in order to build baseball fields. For the relatively few people who live nearby, for hikers and birders and people who run or walk their dogs on the path around the reservoir, the idea of disturbing the site in the service of something so mundane is an unmitigated travesty.
Once the flower is complete, I used Glossy Accents as another adhesive. Place the nozzle down in the center and give a little squeeze, and maybe a few small squirts inside any of the other loose petals. It doesn't take long to dry, and once they are all finished they will be nice and stable.

Greg: As predicted, Joey picked another taco place. Luckily, this one had other options, as my work toilet has been acting up lately. Rojo is tucked away in a residential area near Highland Park. The area is very nice and serves to some of Birmingham’s finest. I had never been to Rojo, but heard good things. As I was looking over the menu, the lady behind the counter suggested he chicken salad sandwich. As noted in previous reviews, I like chicken salad. This version was strong with basil. It was served with steak fries, which is always a plus. The food came out in around 8 minutes, average for a BLC stop. The fries were hot and the sandwich cold, just the way I like it. The basil was a tad overpowering, but overall had a good taste. I would return to Rojo. Overall: 4 out of 5 Bros

Nineteen members of Harvey High School’s Future Business Leaders of America advanced to the National Leadership Conference that will take place in June in San Antonio.
One of the biggest messages I took away from The Leadership in HIV Summit was that HIV in and of itself is not a bad thing; nor is HIV a good thing. It’s just a thing. A virus has no morals or diabolical intentions towards us. Any meaning that is ascribed to HIV is given by people to people as a way of labeling behaviors that are seen as deviant or improper. No one blames a woman with breast cancer for her circumstances and there is no stigma clouding the mind of someone with a bronchial infection. What HIV represents to us individually and as a community is up to us to decide. I saw a huge assembly of people from all over Baltimore and other communities together who may have never experienced one another were it not for HIV. Would the deans and schools of nursing, medicine, social work, law, pharmacy and dentistry at the University of Maryland-Baltimore have all come together for an event without HIV as a driving force? How much attention and advocacy would severely impoverished HIV+ neighborhoods like Druid Hill Park or Union Square get without the catalyst of HIV care? Now that HIV is a chronic, treatable disease and not a death sentence, HIV has the possibility of unifying disparate communities not only for HIV care, but for a whole host of other psychosocial issues as well.
Many prisoners at Quatro had their ears damaged internally because of ukumpompa, which was sometimes done by using canvas shoes or soles of sandals.
It isn't possible for me to accurately describe how horrific our 8 x 8' room smelled. Imagine yak's stomach acid mixed with rotten tomatoes and decaying dead bodies. That would probably get you close. I could barely function, and I was still drunk. My brand new Puma bag and the toothbrushes unfortunately had to go in the trash. So much for trying to freshen up that tossed tequila-cookie breath! I don't recall what I did to clean the cameras and video camera but they did make it home (and I later spent an hour in the garage with a q-tip cleaning vomit out of their crevices).
Anyway, I finally said yes. I reminded her that most of my quilting lately has been small tight decorative quilting, not the type of quilting I would do on a bed size quilt... but that if she let me do what I thought I could do, I would give it a try. I figured it would be a win/win for us both. I would see, if I enjoyed quilting for someone else and all the mind games that come with that and she would have her piece done. I told her I wouldn't charge her, as I didn't know what it would look like in the end. Fair enough.... right?

What is the bottom line when it comes to Blue-Green algae? Avoid it! You can get all the nutritional benefits it may provide from other fruits, veggies, and lean protein sources. Check the ingredient lists of your processed foods and put it back on the shelf if it says “non-animal protein source”, or better yet skip the processed junk and eat whole! Even if it turns out there really isn’t a significant link, do you really want to take that risk with you brain?

Under Google News it is not uncommon to see a large number of sources filed under news stories covering particular events. It is to be expected to find multiple news sources from around the world covering unfolding events. However, what is unexpected is to find a similarly large number of sources under news items that are clearly “opinion” or “editorials.” Just how is it that “journalists” across the Western world simultaneously come to the same conclusions at the same time on the same topics?

Now about 3.5 miles in there were definitely a lot of people beginning to quit. We were nearing the end of any MAJOR hills but weren’t out of the woods yet. We had to climb another rather massive hill to get to Log Bog Jog which was a series of logs placed at various heights in a pool of mud that you had weasel through. It was fun but there were a lot of injuries on this one. It’s known for that.

Right, that's my storage solution for my scraps of paper and collections I've already printed out. Hope it helps someone out there who has been struggling with what to do with theirs. It certainly takes up less room than having them in those cardboard magazine folders (see image) that go on shelves - imagine how much room I'd need if I had one colour in each of those - especially to say that some of them have very little in. In the box they are able to squish together to contain the overall space they take up rather than the width of a lever arch file or one of these magazine holder things.

Ever wonder how I go about choosing whom to memorialize? Well, first off, I'm not the Pope and it's not a canonization. The process isn't entirely selfless, either. Yes, I want to honor the person who's just passed on, but it's also a way of displaying my idiosyncratic tastes and interests. What's the use of having a blog if you can't do that? I basically honor people who have impressed me or intrigued me or have piqued my interest in some positive way. Usually, it's related to the person's chosen profession. In fact, it's always related to their chosen profession. I try not to take their personal life into account. For instance, actor David Carradine either committed suicide or achieved orgasm in the most dangerous way imaginable. Doesn't matter. I liked him in Kung Fu and a few other things, thus I honored him. I'd probably make an exception in the case of murder, so as much as I liked Robert Blake in Baretta...
If lower courts refuse to stay the execution, Stickles said he’ll take his case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which he said has not addressed the question of involuntary medication for the purposes of execution.

1) There were a couple places where I thought the book moved a little too quickly. It’s a short, fast-paced book; a young reader may want some help fleshing out the principles presented. That’s not all bad – if you know a teen who is reading the book, you can read it together and discuss. If you are the teen, you can force some adult you know to turn on the ol’ brain and do something useful.
Here is a quick little card I created for the Sweet Sunday Sketch and the weekly Stamping Bella Challenge which was to use an old favorite stamp. I happen to love the huggabugs and was very surprised to see that I had never inked this sweet little one up soooo it became my fav this week!!
Here’s another card I made recently for a little girl. I embossed the front of the card using my Cuttlebug and the Happy Birthday embossing folder. The little girl on the front was a made with a stamp I borrowed from my sister-in-law, so I am not sure what its name is or what type of stamp it is. She also had a little boy stamp, which I haven’t used yet, but you will most likely see it on another card I’ll make in the near future. I used black embossing powder to make the girl’s outline stand out and added colour with my shiny paint set. The black-embossed ‘b is for birthday’, the cupcake and the candle came in the SU set called Party Hearty. The presents stamp was from a bargain set of clear acrylic birthday stamps I picked up at Michael’s. I stamped each box with a different colour chalk ink pad and outlined the boxes in gel pen colours. The sentiment was one I created using MS Word and printed onto white card stock. The ribbon was one of the bargains I picked up at the scrapbook weekend a couple of weeks ago, put on by the owner of The Scrapbook Cottage.

All children, babies in particular, are different, this I'm fully aware of. But I'm not sure I was prepared for this. Truly and wholely prepared. Now don't get me wrong, I wouldn't change anything, its just I'm having a hard time right now. I never had postpartum with Hallie so feeling down is a new experience. At least after the birth.
When it comes to the shades I have, I actually like them both but really love the Don't Stop Red. It's a great poppy red that actually looks fresh and complimentary on me. I don't normally wear reds, but like this one a lot. The Go Nude is gorgeous too.

My mother taught elementary school for six years from the fall of 1943 to the summer of 1949, when she married. Immediately after their June marriage my parents moved to Florida, which did not recognize Virginia's teaching certificate. It would have required additional years of college to become licensed in Florida - at that time Virginia only required two years of college in a teachers program to become licensed. So instead my mother became a full-time homemaker, and after less than a year of trying found herself pregnant (with me).
On April 12, my husband and I did something very unique and exciting. We are sort of reinventing ourselves - by going to a concert! Ha! We had not been to a concert together since Dinosaur Jr. in 1994. The two bands we saw were incredible, DeVotchKa and The Magnetic Fields. Only recently did I become a fan of both bands, and I did my homework. Within only a few months, I researched each band and the members, acquired as many albums as I found available, and memorized most of their songs. Yes, SIR-REE!. I crammed like I was cramming for finals in college. I’m a hard-core fan now. I even have proof. Check out The Magnetic Fields tour blog at this link. Scroll down through their post about day two in Chapel Hill, and you will see me wearing an owl t-shirt. I think Stephin Merritt likes owls.

In the meantime...once again, I find myself with a boatload of movies I've seen yet have not written about here at My Life, at 24 Frames Per Second.

All of whom look to be on a collision course for the NCAA Championships this year.

One of my favorite things about kids are the words they come up with or the funny ways they say things. Every time they come up with something new, I always think, "I'm always going to remember just the way they said that." But, of course, I usually don't. (The one exception to this rule is that Noah always used to say "your" instead of "you." So, he would say, "How are your doing?" Loved that!)

With all passengers (and buses) accounted for we set off in convoy for Beechworth some 300 kms away. Trivia questions and a beer version of ‘Spotto’ were on hand to keep ‘the kids’ amused on the 3 & a 1/2 hour journey but it wasn’t long before it became clear that Fun & Frivolity would be the order of the day. An exchange of paperwork at the first set of traffic lights kinda set the standard.

The hanging bowls may have held a clear liquid such as water that would leave the internal decorations visible, and might perhaps intensify their visual appeal by rippling prettily over the designs. The model trout in the large Sutton Hoo hanging bowl would also be consistent with the bowl having been used to hold water, as the fish could be seen as ‘swimming’ in the water as it rotated on its swivel pin in the bottom of the bowl.

Boys are doing well. Medium was the only child in his school to score a perfect on his State Assessments. He has been wearing his medal for a couple days now. Large scored high enough to not have to take finals. Small won't take the State Assessment until next year. But he is doing wonderfully on his goals, has actually surpassed expectations. He will be in summer school though, just to keep it going. Medium is taking art and Large has to bring his GPA up so that he can go to school in Japan next year.

I've asked her teacher to let me know what apps Ashley uses at school so we can get the same ones for home. But, I am also interested in apps you may have found to be especially good for a child with special needs. Keep in mind that Ashley is severely visually impaired (blind in one eye, 20/2000 in the other) and severely hearing impaired (profound loss in one ear, severe in the other). She doesn't need any communication type apps, proloquo for example, because she indicated years ago that all she wants and needs for that are her hands for signing. She loves Tigger, SpongeBob and Elmo, and loves looking at people's (mostly children's) faces. She likes numbers and letters, and she likes movement, i.e. dancing letters and numbers. She's not a huge fan of coloring apps because she would rather create three dimensional artwork.

…And that’s the very long story of how Roommate opened the car door when I was in the back seat making out. It’s also a detailed account of why math is practical; all percentages add up to 100, you just need the right equation.
Second of all, though, this is kind of a good point. With the Lich King dead, that should free up a whole lot of Scourge up in Northrend – how did Sylvanas put it that time? “Found themselves unemployed”? And say what you want about Sylvanas, but she’s definitely got enough charisma to get those stray Scourge onto our side. Obviously it worked out with the val’kyr, so I don’t know why she couldn’t do the same thing with the vargul or for that matter even all the zombies and geists and abominations. The funny thing is, it’s not even like all those Scourge have been running around loose since the Lich King’s been dead. I don’t know if they just don’t know what to do with themselves now, or if there’s something else going on, but you would think they’d be primed for somebody like Sylvanas to come along and snap them up.
So this one time a bunch of my best friends were in my bar (per usual) belly up at my bar (again per usual) and 2 of them had always had a penchant for making the other look stupid. Well "Mandy" decided to send the creepiest guy in the bar over to one of the girls and tell him that she really wanted to talk to him. The other girl, not to be outdone, found the next creepiest guy and sent him over. They would send shots each others way saying the creepy guy bought them (well I would be the one to have to say it) and send them to random people from each other, and this would go on for hours. I guess creepy guys do have a good use after all?
Scally and Nathanson, on the other hand, are paid out of enforced taxation to spout this crap, and if we refuse to pay because we really object to our money being given to their ilk - which I do, vehemently - we would be imprisoned.

Before an organisation can take the necessary steps to reduce turnover, it first needs to know the reasons why people are leaving – or thinking about leaving. Surprisingly, only 69 percent of companies use employee surveys on an ad-hoc basis and only 32 percent implement personnel and workplace changes as a result of the findings, according to the Monster study.
Thanks for sharing an overview of my learning process. The process that illustrated is the same one I use to study any discipline. It is one based on foundation-building. I trust that I illustrated that it is important to spend time doing even the trivial hands-on experiments and workshops in order to truly grasp why things are done and thereby truly master the information learned.
5. Treat yourself to something nice each day. Keep it under $5 or $10, or whatever. For me? This morning I had a killer work out (see #4) — I even bench-pressed 110 pounds. That’s a big deal for this geek from Mt. Horeb (Wisconsin) middle school. So, for $10, I treated myself to my favorite diner breakfast at Fuller’s in Portland. I just love the folks there. The owner, Suzy, is the best. I’m set to be in a good mood for the rest of the day after seeing Suzy and her smile (see #1, once again).

I had forgotten everything I’d read about the book by the time I came to pick it up. At first you’ve no idea what the Radleys’ secret is but it only takes two or three chapters to have a pretty good idea. When the big reveal arrived it was no surprise, put it that way. All you have to do is turn the cover upside down and it should be pretty obvious what the book’s about. Unless you have the German edition which has a teacup on the cover and that’s no help at all.
Minding my own business, I was, out of nowhere, the victim of a deranged liberal. You see, contemplating the future of not only myself but my entire God given household, I flicked the cigarette out the window. It enraged the old liberal looser behind me. Driving a bruised and battered, white American car, you know the ones they made a decade ago that were pieces of crap brand new? The jalopy was making a huge racket and spewing Heaven only knows out of its tail pipe into his beloved atmosphere. This crazy bastard is laying on his horn like his hand is permanently attached. At a stop light, I glance in my rear view mirror and I see the lunatic. He's old, with ugly clothes, bad hair, and even worse glasses; red in the face he is hanging out his window screaming at me.

Also, there are “stretch-stitched” gathers along the middle third of the scarf which ruffle the fabric a bit. It’s very generously sized, at least 6 feet long and 45 inches wide if stretched out (but the stitching which makes it bunch up makes it look a lot narrower than that).
Stop your racist view points for this is 2012 not 1969, Tun. You have seemingly deep frozen your philosphies with your Malay Dilema, really. The same type of Malays, Chinese, Indians, Sabahans and Sarawakians that still float within BN are also the members within the opposition coalition.
3. Champions apply what they learn immediately. See, the goal of learning is not knowledge, it is application! How long it took me before I realized this. When you know truth, really know it, it’s supposed to set you free. That’s what Jesus taught in John 8:32. Apply truth to your life. Observe to DO, not to quote, teach or share; that is when it begins to bless your life (see Joshua 1:8; James 1:22-25). It was from Bill Gates I learnt that you should act on your idea or new knowledge within the first twenty-four hours of catching it.

Furthermore, the French Huguenots were white. Christian, Europeans with strong ethnic and genetic blood ties to the people of Britain, it was certainly not as if a group from an ethnically separate culture had settled here. An equivalent might be for a group of Sioux Indians taking refuge with the Comanche following a tribal war with the Apache, they are people of the same ethnic origin, and nobody would expect either group to surrender their indigenous rights on account of an act of human kindness.

"When I am on stage, I see nothing. Now, for example, in the Teatro Monumental, which is huge, it is as if I were in a small box, isolated by the strange atmosphere that the lights produce...I am enclosed in my own little world. It is as if I were floating. Just imagine, here I have one bruise, and here another; my feet are so swollen that I can't even get my shoes on. But when I go out there, I forget everything. It is very beautiful to have that opportunity to live floating for several hours within this constant fighting and suffering that we call life."

Sharing and observing the Feast of Unleavened Bread gives insight on the spiritual truths of the Scriptures and is a healthy reminder to live pleasing to the Lord.
Having talked at such length of violence and struggle, I fear I may leave readers with the impression that this novel is ponderous and depressing—a tough read. In fact, in Sweeter Than All the World, Rudy Wiebe has created a warm, intimate, and very readable portrait of a complex and engaging man, facing a dilemma which is of immediate interest to us all. If the attendant partial survey of humankind’s brutality is unblinking, it is, nevertheless an exhilarating experience to have stared such a beast in the eye, and still come away filled with the sense of hope and comfort that this book imparts.

After reading that several times, I came away with the impression that most of us who are not redheads produce all sorts of natural hair colour, it’s just usually covered up by the darker shades of eumelamin (which would usually be the shade of our dominant hair colour). Sometimes individual hair follicles would just happen to have less eumelanin than other follicles: hence they appear reddish as the pheomelanin are now unencumbered.
I don't know anyone who has achieved some degree of success who hasn't experienced Impostor Syndrome at least once. It's particularly rampant in graduate students. In case you're wondering what I'm talking about, Impostor Syndrome is the name given to that feeling you experience when you wonder if that big publication or grant or raise was awarded based on merit ... or by fooling the people around you into thinking you're smart.

That is the focus of an Amish Christmas.

There are two things that are of great concern to me regarding this event. One is that our top two athletes are aging. Nick Symmonds will be twenty eight by the Olympics; Khadevis Robinson (1:44.03 this year) will be thirty five. This in an event that has seen a major “youth” movement in the last few seasons with this year’s top four athletes in the 21/22 year old age range and the year’s #5 athlete only 17 years old!

PS. As far as I know I don't have many Christian-fundamentalists who want a Christian State type readers. As I was standing up for the constitutional rights of a woman who is alleged to have provided women for prostitution I suspect there is a fracture line there.

Lately I've been on a classic movie high! The past few nights I have watched The Return of the Living Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Cry-Baby (probably my favorite film right now), and Rocky Horror Picture Show on a roll. I admire classic films and would like to base some of my future photoshoots off some. I know it sounds super Rockabilly (I'm not too much into 50s style actually, more into 1940's.) but cult films are so epic!!

Robyn Gordon There are so many wonderful blogs out there and having to choose one is extremely difficult. We have an expression here in South Africa (I'm not sure if it's used elsewhere)..."Let your belly sag", meaning more or less....relax, be yourself, you can stop holding your tummy in , just be. When I go over to Ornamental ( http://ornamental.typepad.com/ ) I let my belly sag. Nina is so real, it feels as though she is an old friend and yet I have never met her. I love the thought of Nina working industriously at her jewellery and journals in her little cottage on Firefly Lane. This industrious buzz makes me want to rush off and create something.

Even if an exercise plan is not followed to the letter (or even planned to be followed). Creating a plan fosters a sense of purpose. By writing my intentions, I designated a space for exercise that was previously a giant blank spot on my day planner. Will I exercise each day? Probably not, especially if any part of me starts creeping into the hurts-like-an-injury danger zone. While I have given exercise permission to claim time out of my day, that does not mean exercise or lack thereof will rule my day.
I did it: I paid off my school loans. Just shy of the seven-year mark. It came about a little ahead of schedule; I decided to take Dave Ramsey's (the financial guru's) advice and dip into my savings to pay it all off at once, rather than dragging it out for the next few months. All told I paid a little under $20,000 for my four-year, state school education. When you add in what I paid for food, off-campus housing and books (which I paid for with some scholarships and money I made while working during college) I would say it was probably closer to $25,000. And I just read an article today that said school loan debt is either about to, or already has, hit a trillion dollars. Yes, trillion. So thank goodness I'm getting out of that particular rat race!

Add the pumpkin to the pot and deglaze with the chicken stock. Add the onions back in and simmer until the pumpkin is soft, about 10 minutes. Puree the soup (a hand blender is easiest, but a regular blender will do). Add in all the remaining ingredients except the coconut milk (don't forget to add in the cooked mushrooms and sausage!), and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the coconut milk.

Ideology -- the mental error of trying to maintain "free trade" when the U.S. faces in reality a kind of ongoing trade war -- can only withstand reality only up to a certain limit, at which point the ideology, or illusion, collapses and great political energy is released. America could actually be pushed into a genuine change in ideology.

For the first time this week (other than when it happened), hubby showed a bit of concern over it. It is a deep bruise and is just now starting to “surface”. He thought maybe I should go to the doctor. I just don’t “do” the doctor thing. No, nothing is broken and there’s no serious internal damage. It’s fine. Give it a few more days and it will start to fade.

Okay, one more thing. Am I the only one who wonders how Young Gul is the Fashion King? So far, we’ve only seen him design the coat when in America and the two dresses he’s made. Other than that, all he has done is copy designs (At the beginning of the series) or use Ga Young’s. Where is his growth as a designer? So far, all we’ve see is basically a businessman at work. Why isn’t he growing as a designer?Right now, my only thought is, STILL SEVEN MORE TO GO?! o_0

Work, or the expenditure of energy, is both a biological and a social necessity for human beings. They must work to use up the energy generated by eating food. They must work also to provide the food, clothing and shelter they need to live. So in any society, be it feudal, capitalist or socialist, men and women must work. The point at issue is how that work should be organised. A very strong argument against capitalism is that it reduces so central a human activity as work to the drudgery it is for most people, instead of allowing it to provide the pleasure it could, and would be in a socialist society.
There are few times in this blog where I’ve felt the need to mention our accommodation. Mostly because it’s been standard hostels – some good, some not so good, some quite rubbish – and really it’s just not that interesting. Who really wants to know about the New York YMCA? Or Godzillas in Moscos? But I do feel compelled to mention the Barton Creek Outpost.

What I don’t think is fair is putting all the blame on the man for the absence of conjugal deeds. To my way of thinking, a resourceful wife should always be capable of goading her husband into giving her a good seeing to. Did this particular lady just lie on the bed like a sack of potatoes, waiting to be ravished like a sacrificial virgin? If so, she must accept her share of the blame for the lack of bedroom action. Sometimes a woman must take the bull by the horns rather than waiting for the beast to gore her.

Before I knew it I was working full-time as an Event Coordinator at the Stampin’ Up! home office here in Riverton, Utah. My job blossomed into a Concept Artist for that team. Soon the actual Art Department approached me and felt like I’d be a good fit. Greatest job ever. Stamping with new products all day long, everything in their catalog at my fingertips. Fun days!

The operation of trafficking, particularly across borders, requires some contacts within official Government departments and law enforcement. Officials will arrange for fake travel documents, access across borders and early release on arrest. Law enforcement can also assist in asserting control over the victim. For example, trafficked women in Karachi, even if they find themselves free from their confinement, have no protection. The police will demand ‘bhatta’ in exchange for their protection. They are often victimised under the Hudood Ordinances and Foreigners Act 1946, have no access to attorneys (although the traffickers have no problem in getting access to them). Police could help victims in attaining prosecutions against their aggressors of rape liable to tazir under various components of the Hudood Ordinances, by questioning trafficked victims as witnesses against the agents; but this is never done.
Our garden was up Station Road near the Superintendent’s house. There was a plum tree and copious quantities of rhubarb. Mum would make jars and jars of jam and there was rhubarb with everything. How I hated it! Marjorie L told me that the daughter of the previous sergeant had peed in the rhubarb, perhaps that was what put me off! During the war sugar, jam, and many other things were rationed. We all had ration books and had to register with our grocer (International Stores). In 1940 each person was allowed 4 ounces of butter, 12 ounces(345gr) of sugar and 4 ounces of ham or bacon each week. As the war progressed there was even less. Everything was sold on surrender of coupons. Mum would save some of the sugar ration to make jam. We then had our own jars. When mine was going down rapidly I would have a spoonful out of Dad’s.

Mom and I spent a good deal of time with our noses pressed to the glass cases holding the gorgeously embroidered and beaded and jeweled copes and robes. Mom's a wonderful seamstress and tried valiantly for years to teach me what came so naturally to her and Grandma. And, alas, failed. However, she did succeed at teaching me embroidery so I'm not completely disowned. Standing in front of Pope Pius IX's red robe, she said over and over, "Look at all those tiny stitches! Just look at them." And then I got to say, "Yes, Mom. I know." Hee hee.
I loved this Vivienne Westwood dress, which made me a little nervous because Rose Byrne is known for wearing some really strange things. However, I think this sparkly black dress is perfect on her. I love dresses with that column shape, and again the one shoulder detail makes her look tall rather than lopsided. The fabric is sparkly enough to make a strong impression instead of making you wonder whether she's put on a very comfortable trash bag for the evening.

When Christian rock came on the scene in the early 1970s, the majority of Bible-believing churches opposed it, even ones that were not “fundamentalist.” I know, because I was there observing the times. I had only recently been saved out of a hardcore rock & roll lifestyle, and I was confronted with the seductive promise of CRock that I could have my formerly beloved rock & roll and Christ, too. But like most of God’s people then, I rejected that position as unscriptural.
Paul Smith was alongside McCall in that Dunfermline team. Smith would later join Hearts for a brief spell in 1995 under the short managerial reign of Tommy McLean.

My personal opinion is that the Panthers are spending a lot of time seeing if one of these is worth a top ten selection. The organization have never been ones to spend high draft picks on receivers, so taking one would be a sea-change. They would need to be fairly certain they were getting an elite talent to invest that heavily in a receiver. Furthermore, I think this could point to the team not looking at a mid-round WR unless he has KR/PR skills. This makes sense because it’s unlikely they would find upgrades over LaFell and Gettis from the 3rd round on.

I am probably being too honest about the bad things, and I am definitely forgetting some of the good, but that is the way I am. Would I go back to being unpublished? Probably not, but I do miss the freedom of just writing without thinking about the end goal. About whether it will sell. About whether people will like it or hate it as much as the first book. About whether being published will finally be a cure for obscurity and insecurity. I am unsure if those feelings ever go away, whether you are published or not.
The national anthem started with still about twenty people ahead of us in line. If I had been in the safety of my corral, I would have really enjoyed that anthem. It was the most beautiful one I had heard at a race. Instead all I could focus on was the bathroom matter at hand. When the corrals started leaving, my new friend and I kept convincing each other that it was totally fine that our corral was leaving without us while 10 more people were still ahead of us in line. We decided that we would wait for each other to get off the pot, and we ran all the way up as close as we could to the starting line. At this point, I think they were about at corral 12. We were supposed to be in 6 and 7, so not too crazy behind our original start.

As we roll into the second week of being back in work the intensity will bump up just a little bit since nothing really taxed her last week. We won't do anything particularly demanding this week either, just moderately push the workload up to see how she responds.
The thing that boggles my mind most about this ad is the repeated substitution of zero for lower-case “o”; seriously, it hurts my brain even worse than it hurts my eyes, because I cannot comprehend any possible reason for it. Is it supposed to be “kewl”, like the substitution of “z” for “s” in “hip-hop” writing? Or is it something even more stupid?

Big brewers in particular were at an advantage with the 6% wastage figure. Large, modern breweries were able to waste far less than smaller more old-fashioned breweries. The downside of re-using yeast and hop pressings, ullage and the like was that they could be a source of infection. Breweries would ruin all their beer, just for the sake of squeezing out every last drop of wort.
By early 1912, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was adapted yet again by director Lucius Henderson, starring James Cruze in the dual lead. Sources say that it ran approximately 12 minutes, but only a partial print remains today (watch here). Although this was at least the fourth time this particular tale had been adapted, it remains notable for being the earliest version of which any footage is known to still exist.
Secondly, if it was people specifically turning up to hear someone talk about writing it might not be too bad, but it's not. Topics vary from week to week - from Medieval Chesham to finding a job online - but the audience remains the same. I'd only bore them rigid.

Tramways de Nice et du Littoral (TNL) operated the tram lines in Nice, France as well as those connecting Nice to other places along like the Côte d'Azur. Back in January of last year, I put up a post on trams in Nice, including an overview of the history and a look at the sleek new system. I won't repeat the information from the previous post, but I do have a number of additional views to show you. Each Tuesday for the next four weeks I will post cards that feature views from different areas of the Côte d'Azur tram lines. Today’s card show you some views in the city of Nice itself as you might have seen them while riding the trams at the turn of the century.
The 'blame Bush ' line might play well in Massachusetts, but I think the president pretty much has worn the novelty of that tune out. A quick check with the Office of Management and Budget reveals that the really huge increase in the deficit coincided with the Democrats taking control of Congress in January of 2007, and went on steroids once Obama got into the White House and had a Democrat super majority to do exactly what he wanted for two years.

I have someone in mind that would likely be the best candidate. He is at least good looking and there was no chance I would ever come to tolerate him, let alone love him. He would likely be fine with it being an arrangement as well, and move on. The others would try to make it more than what it is.

First, traveling with a young child, more importantly one eager to assert their burgeoning independence, is far different from traveling with oneself or another adult. Everything takes more time, which is both good and bad: bad because daily tasks are dreadfully inefficient and frustratingly slow; good because you are forced to slow down, compelled to enjoy your surroundings, to relax, and refresh. Which, for a high-strung, tightly wound person like me is very necessary.
Also 1876 was the centennial of our country so a lot of ladies styles reflected that era as well, so even though it's late 19th Century, it has a touch of Revolutionary War flair to it.

The complaints refused to subside and, predictably, rose again as the holiday approached. On Friday, for example, the Boston Herald demanded: “Carve MLK’s words in stone—accurately.” Out of their mouth into God’s ear, as the saying goes. Sure enough, early in the evening, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar demanded that the Park Service come up with a fix within thirty days. The lead architect replied that the full text still would not fit, but that a compromise abridgement was possible. (Again, one can only wonder: what in the world were they thinking?)

I certainly couldn't give my mom a Christmas tree with no present... so I selected one of my favorite digi stamps from Cindy's Scraptastic Designs! The cute little puppy bursting out of the present is appropriately titled Sweet Gift. Isn't he adorable? I colored him with Copics and sparklified his Santa hat, the box ribbon, and ornaments with four shades of Stickles. (Ha! I'm not addicted... really.) I wrapped gold ribbon around the corners to make the wall hanging look like a present in and of itself, too. :o) At first I wasn't sure about using brighter colors for my stamp (given the rest of the design), but then I realized it's a great way to represent how animals brighten our days. :o) He's a pop of Christmas cheer!
Couple of weeks ago, I said I was going to look out for elections that ‘are Bangladeshi equivalent of the US mid-term or state elections in Indian (and other federal) systems’. Since then, one set of elections — to 236 municipal councils — has taken place. According to media reports, the opposition BNP has done remarkably well, winning most mayor posts in the northern and southwestern parts of the country. Awami League has won most posts in the southern and central districts.
I spent the fourth of July with a bunch of friends; there was a BBQ at Katie’s house. That night we drove to the city to watch the fireworks. I made my first attempt at taking photos of fireworks and think I did rather well. After watching the fireworks we made our way back to Katie’s.
In the last post I already mentioned how Venice was also a little weird and sketchy. Well, “Marijuana Way” would definitely be the more appropriate name for Venice’s beach promenade :) Every other store is either a “pipe shop” with inifinite numbers of bongs, pipes, bubblers, hookahs and many more things in stock, or it is a “medical marijuana evaluation center”, i.e. a place that checks out if you’re eligible for a medical marijuana card.

Alive Eve was not in the story enough to make a complete assessment of her own acting skills, but my thoughts are that her character did not seem to fit in the 1849 world that they were supposed to live in. Neither did the term "serial killer," which was used with wild abandon for a time when the term itself would not exist until well into the next century. And the jury's still out on Emily's use of her metal corset boning to file through wood being possible- was metal boning in existence in 1849?

When you are learning photography, be it from a teacher or reading from books, flare is usually categorized as one of those “minimize as much as possible” type of effects. It reduces the photo’s contrasts and leaves a circular spot in your frame. You are always told to use lens hoods to avoid flares, and try not to shoot at the sun or bright lights directly. Of course there are also great expensive lenses with different coatings which can also reduce the flare…
To fully appreciate the beauty, the history and the geography of the island you could do no better than look at Marilyn's Blog (Hanging On My Word) and also John's own blog (Lanzarote on Foot). My own pictures can merely give an impression of my memories of the island and its' stunning scenery. My photograph for today was taken in the north of the island on the high cliffs overlooking the small northern island of La Graciosa. The picture captures some of the rich colour of the island - the brown and umbers of the baked earth and the deep blue of the sea. The photograph also serves to remind me that Lanzarote is an island of views and prospects where the natural shapes of land, coast and mountain are set off perfectly against the vibrant background of sea and sky.

I recall the day he graduated and the excitement I felt for him knowing that today (Graduation Day) was the day when all his hard work – physical training, study and long days were about to pay off. He had put in the hard yards, he never lost sight of his goal (to become a Fireman) and Graduation Day was the day where he would be rewarded for his motivation, discipline and dedication. His dream of being a Fireman would become his reality.

When I looked back, remembered and gave myself over to search and questioning, I came away with much more than I had bargained for. What was first experienced through distance and fascination, my earliest pictures of this subject attest to this, turned into something far too complex to be depicted solely through irony. Instead, I found the swirl and ache of regret and beauty. I made a picture once, as part of Dog Town, of an empty roadside fruit stand along the highway on one of my many road trips. It had a weathered sign that had once said PEACHES, but the “p” and the “e” were nearly worn away. The first impression reads that it said ACHES before the rest of the word begins to appear. This photograph didn’t make it into the final edit though I printed and re-printed it and tried and tried to make it work. Memory and the sensual are intrinsically linked and in the end I couldn’t breathe life into it. Despite my desire it stubbornly refused to move beyond the illustrative.
The big selling point of the Acer Iconia Tab A200, though, is the fact that it ships directly with Android Ice Cream Sandwich. And Google’s latest update works well, with plenty of small tweaks such as the ability to load apps into folders and save web pages for viewing offline at a later date.

The Israelites were the chosen nation of God. If God did not give them a great military to destroy men and nations where does that leave the rest of the nations that did not bring Christ into the world? Russia has a great military and so does North Korea. So does Iran and other nations. So does this mean that when we see nations acquire great destroying weapons it means that God is smiling on them?
When we got a (verbal) offer this week from someone immediately after seeing the house, we negotiated and accepted. While waiting for the paper work, the deal fell through and it was pretty heart breaking (and frustrating). However, we had a 'back-up plan', that being another couple traveling from out of city (and province) to come see our place (and a few others). Fortunately they loved ours the most and made an offer within 24 hours of seeing it. After going over the details, making a couple changes, we accepted and are supposed to close in just over three weeks! Excitement ensues!

So the rushing about like a headless chicken has caught up with me... Last week was two AA chairs, travelling to them and Paradise Lost gig, a bit of stress at work with some important meetings, gig preparations and gig on Saturday (went well I will post about that soon as I can) and then a drive to Wales and back to return S-o-F to university - D-o-F came along too... So I drove over 1000 miles in one week which for someone who commutes by train into London everyday and doesn't drive even to the station is fairly nuts. Well by last night all was not well. My Migraine Associated Vertigo is bad, couple that with a few nights of rubbish sleep, not helped by the migraine symptoms and finally this morning I went into work but had to throw the towel in straight away and return home. I should be resting really not on here typing away so that this pain in the head goes away....

A saving grace for me is that much of Sandler’s more unpleasant man-child shtick is kept to a minimum. He does not have an anger management problem.

As some of you know I am a picture taking loon, I carry my camera with me every where that I go so that I can pull it out at a snap shots notice and start clicking away. This is the normal for me, at every party, sports game, play date, new tablescape, random moments, and this past week with Mike's family visiting Texas to for the first time. Well as I checked my camera this mid-morning I noticed that I had 638 pictures on my camera, knowing this evening is going to be my son's first T-Ball pratice, I wanted to make sure like any good picture taking loon of a mother that I has plenty of room on my camera's memory card for all those pictures I just knew I was going to be taking as he and his new team mates praticed away for the first game on Saturday... so like the normal thing to do, I down loaded the pictures from my camera to my trusty computer. The way things are set up after everything has down loaded with out problems, 'it' auto deletes the pictures from my camera... this is what happened ( or at least seemed to happen) just like every other time I have ever put pictures from my camera on to my computer.... until today I don't know how, why, when, or anything else all I know is that I can NOT find all 638 pictures I down loaded today, the pictures from the ENTIRE family vacay, the birthday party for the little boy across the street, Morgan's family birthday party we had on Monday for him with the grandparents.. NOTHING! I think I feel tears coming on....

Today’s topic is about mental changes. This one was the most difficult and most vulnerable for me to write. Yet, in my opinion it’s one of the most important changes needed to truly succeed at weight loss. I found, and you can probably tell from previous posts, that overeating and unhealthy eating is mental. Your body does not need unhealthy foods or massive quantities of food to survive. In fact it needs just the opposite.

We're very lucky since a lot of my friend's older children don't even acknowledge their newborn siblings let alone try to play with them. It's not unusual for Lizzie to pile Poppy under all her favorite stuffies, including Bear-Bear (in the dirt above) her most prized bear of all. Poppy doesn't really like to be piled under four or five bears but she'll learn someday that her older sister is being very sweet. It melts my heart to see them together. I wanted nothing more than two little girls and I got them! How lucky am I?!
What strength could be found by defeating that façade… what honesty, truth, love and beauty could be given fully when there is no masquerade? No pretense. Would we discover that we are much closer to becoming the person that we long to be, if we did not hide our true selves away from the world?
All of us can look back and kick ourselves for not doing what we were told. Or on the other hand we can do the same because we did obey the wrong person. We find the same thing in secular history. But today we are looking at some examples in Biblical history, which to me are more profound.
Before the year is out, I'm travelling HOME.
Having said that, I DO think the interest rates should be reduced, or at least that should be forgiven, and if someone has already paid more than what was originally owed, they should be eligible for some sort of loan forgiveness. Likewise, those who can’t find jobs should be given amnesty until they do find employment of some sort…and again, the biggest culprit in this whole thing is the horribly high interest rates. It practically guarantees you never get out of debt. If the government could bail out wall street, at the very least, I think they could do that much for the next generation of workers in this country.
The gig was sourced from the 1991 Jap CD Box-set; which is the best digital source for the gig in my opinion. Yes much better then the 2007 reissues of Still, which was compressed all to fucking hell! “24 Hours” was sourced from a vinyl rip of the UK 1st pressing of Still. A matrix of the Audience and Soundboard recordings of "Ceremony" was done to produce a full mix. I know another blog that featured such a mix, but it was discovered that mix was off. This is a fresh mix. Also “24 Hours” was edited to fit properly into the set. Lastly, the whole recording was Remastered. Honestly, this is the best version of this gig by far.

There are any number of reasons why Gnosticism was bound to come into conflict with that portion of the Church which was consolidating into an institutional monolith. Gnosis, by its very nature, was an individual experience that eluded systematisation. While the Gnostics had priests and even bishops, their leadership derived from their mystical bonafides, not from a bureaucratic position of authority. Furthermore, the canonical Gospels portrayed Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy and the Messiah promised to the Hebrews. The Gnostics’ break with what they considered the Demiurge was at cross purposes with this historical reading and undermined the working mythos of the institutional Church.
The test had been taken a week ago. In that time Martha had managed to relegate it to the back of her mind; to that convenient place where dust gathered on the cobwebs and people were too polite to say anything about it. Except now she could no longer ignore it. At some point she was just going to have to admit it to herself, to other people, to Eric. How on earth was she going to tell Eric?
1. The Town of Orleans has spent over $1million in taxpayer funds on Wright-Pierce for consulting services. W-P has developed a CWMP that calls for increasing the discharge of effluent at T-T from 32, 000 gpd to 640,000 gpd. Despite stacks of reports and reams of paper, the Town's consultant has never compiled a summary statement of the likely groundwater impacts of this effluent and freshwater load on Namskaket. The record reveals a complete disregard for these valid environmental and financial concerns. The W-P evaluation of the hydrogeology at the T-T plant siting has been a "sham" of "misinformation, dissembling and intentional obfuscation." The CCGPF directly attributes this pattern of activity to Mike Giggey, the Town's consulting engineer.
Further, you'll find yourself buying to just about every aspect of the film thanks to some truly great performances by its cast. Lon Chaney Jr. is almost as good here as he was in anything he ever made, playing a kindhearted, trusting Everyman whose faith in his doctors ends up dooming him. Meanwhile, Lionel Atwill will have you hating him through-and-through as his characters' manipulative, self-centered ways seem all the more evil because he is exploiting and abusing such a nice guy as Chaney's character. The supporting cast are all likewise excellent in their parts, but it is Atwill and Chaney who make this movie and who elevate it to a level that almost equals Universal Studio's spectacular horror films of the early 1930s.

There will always be disappointments but also moments of joy, and wonderfully supportive colleagues in the other writers I meet.
When my children were very young, I used to attend a prayer meeting led by an elderly saint named Ezra DeVol. I always looked forward to praying on Wednesday nights with the elderly people, many of whom were retired missionaries.
There are days that go as easy as pie and then there are days when things hit the fan. On those days I scream like a banchy when I step in a spilled drink that no one bothered to clean up, or freak out that we are running out of time to get someplace and no one cares. But despite my behavior my little men still want me to read them a book, draw me a picture or tell me they love me. I love that they love me unconditionally and love me for who I am.
I suppose I have to think of this in neither a good/bad manner, but rather accept that the intensity of these transitions is appropriate and important to consider.
At that time, Les Miserables (or, “The Glums”, as the English came to call it in their inimitably wry, jokey way!) was very new onto the scene.
Jordan won rookie of the year and a defensive player of the year award. Kobe was on the bench his rookie season and is never even mentioned in the conversation for top defender honors. Kobe came straight out of high school, but that’s no excuse for him to start his career on the bench. I’m sure he could of went to any college in the country to play, but he declined and headed straight for the NBA. Jordan spent three years at the University of North Carolina and won a National title. Some will argue and I agree that going to college prepares a player’s body and mind for the NBA. Kobe has already been playing a whole season longer than Jordan. There is no doubt that the both are Hall of Famers, as Jordan was inducted in 2009.

Nick Clegg who is the closest neighbouring MP to Barnsley, conscious of public image, decided not to endorse Carman. Maybe because it was part of a damage limitation exercise or maybe, as we feel, his dislike of Carman junior and that is a bold judgement call when you are Deputy Prime Minister?

I came home from work earlier in the week to find him basically in a state of collapse!!! He couldn't walk or weight bear and kept falling to one side, unable to get back up!!!!
My father's contribution to the management of my teenage health was somewhat different to that of my mother. When I was at home for the holidays with one of those hacking coughs that to this day provides a winter serenade on the top decks of London buses, he would sit on my bed at night and exert me to develop the willpower to stop my coughing. It seemed to me that, from his perspective, my cough was a product of a lack of self-control and the remedy was Willpower and Faith in God. Since at that time I was a dutifully religious boy, it must be my willpower that is in short supply. A physiological rather than psychological rationale for my coughing wasn't, as far as I can tell, part of Dad's understanding of my condition, which is surprising in a man who was a science teacher. Perhaps he lost his faith in science at the time his faith in God burgeoned. If so it would be the mirror image of the trajectory of my later teenage years when I rejected creationism and a designer universe and plumped on science to provide me with a better understanding of the world around me.
This presented a problem to the Westport Board of Education that I’m not sure they’ve ever had to address before. As far as I can remember, I was not placed in an English as a Second Language program, probably because (I’m going out on a limb here) I was one of the first completely non-English speaking students they were ever presented with.

What I Do
Yesterday, I wrote a lovely piece about the dangers of following parenting "doctrines" too closely. In that post, I mentioned that there really are a lot of different ways to parent, based on the variety of circumstances and beliefs inherent in any particular family. While I have my own opinions about cloth diapers, breast feeding, co-sleeping, and TV restrictions, I also recognize that there are millions of brilliant parents with healthy, happy kids who do not share my views. That alone indicates that there is more than one way to skin a cat, as it were.
In addition to moving often as an adult, I also moved

So, WordPress sends out an email every week called the Weekly Photo Challenge. It has a different theme every week, for instance, ‘Sun’ or ‘Journey’, and asks bloggers to post pictures to their blogs on that theme. I decided to get in on the fun this week, with the theme of ‘Unfocused’. I took these pictures at an amusement park in Pennsylvania called Dutch Wonderland. Situated right in the middle of Amish country, the theme park is smaller than what you’d expect from a Six Flags or Disney park, but still packs in the fun. Where else is milking a fake cow or posing in a horse-drawn buggy considered entertainment?

Bottom line, the Sudbury model is easily the most empowering form of education I’ve experienced in two decades as an educator: our students exhibit a maturity far beyond their years, while retaining the best child-like qualities. Articulate and self-possessed, they exemplify confidence and playfulness. Full of enthusiasm and free from fear, they are remarkably adept at knowing and becoming who they are, identifying and achieving their goals.

But not just in romantic situations, telling others what you think of them and appreciating them is never ever overrated.

Recently in a discussion on a forum board I noticed a post by an author which set my mind in a whirl, as I began to wonder how many people seem to be stuck in a total misunderstanding of what the "Publishing Paradigm" has become. Words and terms which once meant and implied one thing are now totally different in their meaning. Even and most importantly the word "Publisher" especially when it applied the realm of "book publisher" has totally changed focus and meaning. (To be honest Magazine publishers are also suffering from the newly created paradigm, but in a much different manner.)

Resentful of de Soto's demands for food, blankets and furs, a group of Chickasaw Indians attacked his camp at night, successfully setting it ablaze. People, livestock and equipment perished; the expedition was left virtually naked. But despite this second devastation, the Spaniards rallied themselves amazingly and spent two weeks fabricating weapons and gear from local materials and salvaged effects. When the Chickasaw returned, the Spaniards defeated them easily, but it was clear that the mission had to continue westward out of this hostile territory.

To answer this question I need to quote Whoopi Goldberg. In an interview on the programme "Inside the Actors Studio" some years ago she mentioned two types of ignorance she'd come across: voluntary and involuntary. I suffered from the former in Cuba due to the regime's censorship on books, music and films. But I hate the latter and it's the one that I encounter more often here in the UK. People who have access to a wealth of culture and information and prefer to remain dumb. Not only that, but also they feel entitled to express their uneducated opinions even when they have no basis to do so. I'm still involuntarily ignorant, and who isn't? Knowledge is infinite but our capacity to acquire isn't. However, I still remain as inquisitive and curious as ever.
I wonder if we will ever get to the point where we just accept each other and really make a concerted effort to get along with each other. We have so much abundance. We have so many resources and we have an incredible amount of ingenuity. Why not use it in a good way?

Rising interest rates, which depress bond prices, are therefore essentially equivalent to inflation. To this way of looking at it, when the Fed raises rates, it is simply channeling inflation into debasing bond prices rather than money.
After the A to Z Challenge, and the excitement of talking about my favourite children's books for the postings, I am faced with being speaker at women's groups again and the three book signings that are not too far away. More importantly, I have set myself the task of completing the sequel to Candle Dark by the end of July. Woe is me. I've written the first draft, twenty two thousand words. My books are usually about the forty thousand mark, so much to do! For those of you who write for adults, forty thousand words must seem ridiculous. But I make things difficult for myself by writing in the first person; in this case as a child who lives in 1780, and with the accompanying problem of how to make the speech sound authentic and yet possible for today's children to understand.
The evening started off with two passionate pieces from flamenco guitarist Chuscales, a Santa Fe resident from Spain who has played with renowned dancer Maria Benitez, among others. Brazilian vocalist Claudia Villela then joined Bruce Dunlap for several songs that featured Villela's amazing voice. She has a fresh and seductive delivery that combines elements of traditional scat jazz singing a la Ella Fitzgerald with a tropical style all her own. Her unique phrasing will suddenly jump into percussive sounds that you'd swear was a drummer splashing brushes off the cymbals, or a trumpeter in full flight. Bruce Dunlap is the perfect foil to Claudia's leaps into the unknown; he’s a master improviser who feels at home in any uncharted territory. Pianist Art Lande brought his dazzling technique down from Boulder, Colorado, and joined Dunlap and Villela in an impromptu trio that made like they’d been playing together their entire lives.

Interesting question, but not necessarily the one I would ask. I’ve opted in, out and all things in between and what I can tell you is this: It’s way more complicated than those two little words tend to imply. When my kids were small, I worked from home — only because I was lucky enough to have a career and family finances that allowed for it. When they grew up, I switched out magazine writing for teaching and what I realized was this: I never ever could have juggled the time crunch of being a full-time professor with raising a family without flipping out. To wit: there’s a reason male professors are more likely to have children than female professors, and even when the latter do have a family, it’s usually one child only.

I am concerned, because I hear a lot of rhetoric being used by your leadership that marginalizes and demeans me. I hear disturbing talk about raising an "Army of God" to fight against "Godless liberals and secularists". I hear your leaders talking about packing the Supreme Court with justices who will impose your beliefs and morality on all Americans. I hear you calling this a "Christian Nation", even though you know many of your neighbors are not Christian. I hear your leaders urging you to oppose me at every turn, though I offer no specific threat to you or your beliefs.

In my opinion, colorless or “blanca” tequilas have a smoother taste than the gold. Also, you should use fresh squeezed lime juice. The limes should be ripe, juicy and soft. Finally, the most appropriate type of salt is considered to be the coarse kosher salt.

Next add cleaned and washed mint leaves and chopped coriander leaves. Mix well for a minute and add the powders. Stir well and water( for every cup of vermicelli add 1 and half cup of water).

Lastly, I’m Pro-Life. I think that I need to discuss this since this issue has been one of the hottest issues in politics not only in the Philippines but also in other countries such as the United States of America.

Barry Ritholtz nails the right reasons for blogging, at least as they apply to me personally.

Shortly before I left for Thailand, I wrote a blog post about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and all of the plastic debris floating around in the Pacific Ocean — also known as the largest landfill in the world.

If April showers bring May flowers the roof high fully blooming azaleas and rhododendrons in PA validate that proverb. I missed the flowering dogwoods which were very early this year, because March was so warm however, here and there were many gorgeous bushes to behold. Like these twin beauties off Millerstown Rd near Mt. Top RV our home while back home. You will notice the hillside, I come from a land of hills which makes it look as though one house is on top of the other but it is not. Just look at the house closest to the twin bushes, that is the a rooftop of the house and yes the flowering shrubs grow that big. We have seen some that were bigger than the home to which they belonged. Absolutely gorgeous.
My final task is to check their literacy. Whilst this is not a precondition of employment, it is handy to know who can and can't write. There is something truly heart wrenching to watch a vivacious and confident young person stumbling over writing their own name or reading a sentence from a magazine. I hate that this skill is denied them meaning that their opportunities are curtailed and they are sentenced to manual jobs for life.

Meanwhile the Gamekeepers are really the book and journal publishers, who keep the Tributes on their toes trying to make sure that they publish enough to earn tenure. The Tributes do a cost-benefit analysis thinking about which journals are the highly ranked ones and have the fastest review and publication turn-around in order to meet the department requirements. There also is the possibility of sponsors, if you are lucky. You get the sponsors via courting the senior faculty members in the department. They might give you connections, publishing opportunities, and vote for you when your file is under review.
I have no documentation that John Stanley wrote these. That they (a) line up with his typical Lulu scenarios, (b) are often quite funny and (c) use language in a comical way leads me to this conclusion.

I did some experimenting this week too, mostly out of necessity, but with some great results. Since starting a vegetarian diet in late January, I've made an effort to cook as many meals as I can in two batches - with meat and without - so that my husband isn't forced into going meatless if he doesn't want to. I had the makings for some really quick enchiladas for him - frozen rolled tacos topped with a can of enchilada sauce, grated cheese, and sliced olives. Easy! But I didn't have any meatless rolled tacos that I could eat. I did have corn tortillas, though, and knew I could come up with something to fill them. I had several pouches of Uncle Ben's and Seeds of Change brands ready-to-serve rice dishes in the pantry. One of them was a Santa Fe version and included black beans, corn, brown rice, red and white wheat, tomatoes, peppers, and spices. I warmed my corn tortillas in just a few drops of oil in a small skillet, put a couple spoonfuls of rice down the center of each one, and rolled them up. I used a 9" x 13" pan and filled it with half of the frozen rolled tacos, half of my rice filled rolled tacos, topped it all with enchilada sauce and sliced black olives. I used regular grated colby jack cheese on my husband's half, and vegan cheddar flavored grated cheese on my half. I was expecting them to be a little bland and not thoroughly enjoyable, but I was wrong. They were great!

Since the birth of Noah it has been a rollercoaster ride with Fabio. He has a lovely girlfriend who is more engaged and seems more caring about our son than he is. I get along very well with her and am very happy she is a grounding influence in his life. He is still a distant person in our lives and I don’t think he will ever be a fantastic influence in my son’s life but I am thankful that we can all get along and Noah will know where he came from. He can make his own decisions about the quality of his Father’s parenting when he is old enough. Until then it is my job to facilitate their relationship to the best of my ability. I think it helps that there are no confused emotions there. I think it makes it easier to make decisions that are in Noah’s best interests.

In terms of interaction, I feel there isn’t too much interaction. There is reasonable number of comments but comments are not always responded to. But I am finding that is the case with most travel and photo bloggers. Possibly they believe when photos are speaking for themselves, the blogger need not unnecessarily waste words. But this blog definitely has scope for more interaction. The blogger clearly has lot knowledge on wildlife and photography. So the visitors might find it helpful to have a section where they can ask for tips and guidance. Possibly a separate static page for this purpose can be added.

I looked up some red mushrooms and found all sorts with little white dots on them. OK. Call me weird, but I really thought that those little red mushrooms with white dots were just made up whimsical things. They actually exist. WOW. Ok... so I decided after I colored my red mushrooms that I had to add the little white dots. Once I had colored it (colors below), I started digging through my DCWV stacks. I have this one stack (the Green stack) that has all sorts of cutesy things in it - including mushrooms and owls and stuff like that. This paper was in there. So I cut out my mushroom (leaving a LITTLE bit of white around it (not what I usually do), and then added it to this sheet. Afterwards I used my Nestie to make the tag out of another paper in the pack, and mounted both of these on red.

I don’t want to go to grad school. The very thought of it fills me with crippling anxiety. At first I thought that this anxiety was just one more thing I had to overcome, because I obviously had to go to grad school. And then I realized that even contemplating going back to school made me unhappy. I didn’t want to deal with buying another car, stacking up new student loans, and reselling textbooks assigned but never opened. Why was I trying to inflict this on myself? And if I wasn’t going back to grad school, why wile away at some dead-end cubicle when my computer-savvy husband makes more than enough for two of us and enjoys it?
The practice of circumcision itself is not unique to the Jews in the Ancient world, although some of the traditions based on the Old Testament are specifically Jewish. Circumcision is given as a sign of the Covenant of Abraham in Genesis 17. All male members of Abraham’s household are to be circumcised, those that wish to be joined to Abraham’s family must be circumcised (see Genesis 34, for example.) While the practice of circumcision was common in Ancient Israel, the ritual itself did not confer “spiritual blessing” as a sign of the covenant. For this reason the prophets told the people that they needed a “circumcised heart – clearly a metaphorical use of the idea of circumcision (Deut. 10:16, 30:6; Jer 4:4; Ezek 44:7, 9).

Anna Dorsett: “The Avengers, while thoroughly entertaining, does not skim over the darker portions of a superhero’s struggle. Dr. Banner, for example, overcomes his inner struggle and finds balance with his human self and super human self with the acceptance and support of the Avengers- he, as a human, found a positive purpose for his destructive power, which he formerly despised. Each character has incredible power, but also a weakness within- some form of humanity that works against them to give the storyline more drama and make the character more relatable. It’s a great thing to watch.”

Derry (or Londonderry if you insist) is Northern Ireland's second biggest city, after Belfast, which doesn't make it especially big. In the middle, on the west side of the River Foyle, is the Walled City, and at the south end of the Walled City, just inside the Bishop's Gate, right at the top of a steep hill that's a bugger to climb if you're carrying a case full of books, is the Verbal Arts Centre, venue for the daytime portions of the festival. All the way down the hill and out through the Shipquay Gate is Sandinos Bar, venue for the evening bits.

Police still believe Ready shot himself after shooting the others.

Well, while talking with Mandy a few nights ago I found out that California has really been weighing heavy on her heart, that she wants to go there so badly.

Once you have dried off your boat completely, you may want to apply a quality wax and buff to shine and protect the fiberglass.

Use a quality carnauba wax and apply several coats
Finally, Brownie was free-wheeling! And what did the Bitch do on her semi-virgin voyage?

I know, another polish related post. I swear I'll have something different tomorrow (June faves, perhaps) but I caught up with some swatching over the weekend (15 bottles and still a bunch I didn't get to...) and I figured it would be best to get to these before they are completely irrelevant. If you follow polish, you've probably already seen these or at least know how often new shades and collections are introduced. It can be a bit dizzying. I keep up with new shades and what not, but I don't always purchase more than one or two (or any a lot of the time.) That said, I was browsing Amazon and saw this little mini set and thought I'd give this collection a try.

I don't think I could ever get tired of pizza. It's been a staple throughout my college years (is this where the nostalgia sets in..when I talk about food?). I feel I've moved up the ranks in my pizza obsession in these last four years. It started out as it would with any young, naive freshman, ordering late night pizza from the greasiest place in town, Gumby's. There is honestly nothing better than Gumby's "Pokey Stix" at 2am. They're garlicky, greasy and delicious. You can also smell them from a mile away and get an XXL for $10. It was an essential part of making friends. The problem is, you only enjoy Pokey's for the brief time you are actually eating them. Guilt sets in about five minutes later. Then slight nausea.

So I have an emergency stash. Tonight for example my daughter and I are having pre-made chicken schnitzels I got at the supermarket deli, add some cooked pasta (for her) and salad and some cooked veggies (for me) and it's a quick meal. At $3 for 2 schnitzels on sale it is also a whole lot cheaper than take out and we are eating veggies and salad.
Will we hold onto something that is ultimately worthless, or will we give it up for real life? To give it up requires faith. It requires us to trust that there is a real resurrection, that real life is still waiting for us. We can see and touch the fake things, like Chuck could touch and see the volleyball Wilson. But those things are not as real and true as what awaits us when we trust in Jesus. Jesus said:

There is something magical about Olympic seasons, as they bring out the best in the world’s athletes. Good athletes become great, just ask Donovan Bailey, Michael Johnson, or even Usain Bolt himself did in the past. And entering this Olympic year there is a preponderance of sprint talent waiting for its chance at greatness. Many of whom I outlined above, some of whom will emerge that we never expected to be in the hunt – that’s the way of the sport.
While I am not sure that what follows this statement throughout the rest of the chapter about what this change means is entirely new nor incredibly insightful (e.g. “These Hebrew words…express the idea that our heavenly father is all-powerful” (129)), to me this change is of monumental importance.

I was telling my friend last night that the times I’ve felt most alive are the times I’ve been most uncomfortable. The more new a situation is, the more unknown, the more I absorb the moment because I have no preconceived idea of what it can be like. I feel like I step out of my mind and into being-ness. So many times the world becomes stale, repetitious, and boring because we are not fully living the experience. Our mind has a habit of labeling every new moment. It likes to label and move on. But when we start labeling everything with only words we start containing the un-containable and we start missing out on the mystery that lies beyond words and beyond mind. Life is meant to be lived from your being(your heart) not from your head.

Anyway, a comment was posted regarding the closure of OLGA, the online guitar archive by the music publishing industry due to the fact that free tablature was available on the site and that was copyright infringement. I replied saying it was sad and reminiscing about the difficulties fledging axe-meisters had in the late 60s trying to get sheet music that was transcribed for guitar and how, if easily-accessible tab had been around my guitar playing would improved imeasurably. Mr Music Man replied saying he didn't play other people's music, it was "boring". He only ever played his own. So a friendly debate ensues. Some of us in favour of the "learning other stuff outside your comfort zone stretches you" school and him. "I create I don't regurgitate" he wrote, and "I'm doing something fresh and new".

With each step she got more and more clear about what it was she really loved doing, which was helping other writers to get that elusive first publishing credit.

If you wanted to sum up the aesthetic taste of the Millenial generation in a single phrase, it probably would be “function is sexy.” Most of you grew up troubleshooting PCs so you could steal music off the internet while your parents blew money on CD’s and struggled with rudimentary cellphones. It’s why we love Google and Apple. It’s why we like video game consoles. It’s what makes the Steyr AUG such a sexy, sexy gun.
But, sure, this is a serious geopolitical and military problem: if you conduct basically a triage of the world's human population – where some people are exiled from the world economy, and some spaces no longer have roles – then you’re offering up ideal opportunities for other people to step in and organize those spaces to their own ends. This is a deeper and more profound situation than any putative conflicts of civilization. It is, in a way, a very unexpected end to the 20th century. Neither classical Marxism, nor any other variety of classical social theory or neoliberal economics, ever predicted that such a large fraction of humanity would live in cities and yet basically outside all the formal institutions of the world economy.

Sometimes, when the shot is fired at close range these particles can impregnate the skin, leaving small permanent abrasions distributed in a concentric formation, which when still fresh have a reddish brown colour, hence the reason why the phenomenon is often described as “tattooing”, because it CANNOT be washed off. The tattooing-effect can obviously be influenced by other intermediate mediums such as hair or fabric.
As you can see I am in a frosty, wintry sort of mood.
Start to tuck all fabric in and around the sitting part of the chair, make sure to “smooth the fabric, then tuck”. Always make sure the fabric is smooth before moving on. Depending on what type of chair it is, you can even pin down into the crevice of the chair to secure it won’t move, but you dont have to. I didn’t and it is fine. If you do choose this, then you will need an extra piece to cover the seat of the chair, you might even have tosew a cushion cover( which is not that simple, we won’t get into all that)

Many would ask why they should support Labour and give them their vote if it just means the continuation of Con-Dem policies? For others, because there is currently no mass workers' party which puts forward a real alternative to the Con-Dem cuts, there is a hope against hope that Labour will be able to get rid of the Tories, and stop at least the worst of the cuts.
