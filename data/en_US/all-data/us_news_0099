The last time I saw a presentation like this one was the fourth grade. Why did commissioners sit through such an insulting dog-and-pony show?
Hangout factor: The Oregon City shop definitely lacks curb appeal; unless you notice the crowds inside at lunch and after work, you might drive right on by. The interior is surprisingly spacious but bare and uninviting; most customers linger only long enough to get their takeout orders.
This month, Slay Jr.'s ticket finally got paid. It had been reduced to "excessive vehicle noise" - no state driving penalties.
The Coast Guard launched a search after receiving an emergency transmission from a beacon that activates when it gets wet. The agency dispatched a helicopter from Atlantic City and a 47-foot rescue boat from Barnegat Light. It also broadcast an urgent request for help to mariners.

"As drivers, we tend to look out for other drivers. It's human nature," Mobley said. "But Maryland's transportation system isn't simply about roads and cars, it's about pedestrian and bicycle access, too. … The unfortunate thing is that when you pit a car or truck against a pedestrian, that car or truck will win every time."

After making headway in 2008 on a four-year plan to wipe out its athletics deficit, Oregon State University lost ground last year in part because of the recession, donations that flowed 20 percent below expectations and a timing glitch that forced the university to wait until this fiscal year to collect on $1.9 million in pledged contributions, said Mark Spencer, associate athletic director for business operations.
It's all very tense, with stakes unfathomably high; this is uncharted territory. So it's no surprise that the night will involve arguments and compromises, as well as sacrifices. There isn't a lot of growth in the characters, because they arrive fully formed -- for better or worse. They're all afraid, of course, although Tuld would never dare show such an emotion. Others are not so immune to their fears.
Sheehan was in trial Tuesday and could not be reached for comment.
Nearly half of Oregon, about 30 million acres, is covered by forests, making it the second most-forested state after Alaska. Agriculture is the second-leading land use, about 16 million acres.
South America isn't the easiest place in the world to look for fossils, especially not the tiny, fragile remains of ancient rodents. Lush vegetation covers much of the continent, obscuring whatever bones may have survived the ravages of time.
According to court documents, the woman told police that as she was taking her infant daughter out of a car seat, a man later identified as Hampton approached her and threatened to hurt her and her baby if she didn't get back into the car and drive him where he wanted to go.
The link between each building system is growing more complex. Active monitoring of the building environment requires all systems to act in unison to achieve the highest energy efficiency. When these systems are not calibrated to operate as designed, the optimum building performance is not realized.
Then came a move I needed to replay five times to believe actually happened. A tumbling, off-balance Hillis, refusing to allow Crocker to make him stop the clock, quickly turned his right side and buried it into the turf inches inside the white paint. Hillis's head hit the ground awkwardly at 2:40. He rolled out of bounds at the Cincinnati 46 as Crocker bounced off him and fell.
Raising money, on the other hand, is like catching. Presentation of the fly matters greatly. However, casting where there are no fish is an exercise in futility, except, you can't know if there are no fish. You have to assume that every cast is right on the nose, with a pink flashabou pattern that they cannot resist. But then there is no take. Like pitching your PowerPoint to the angels who don't fund or the venture capitalists who say they have money, but really don't. They just like to look at the fly. That way they can collect their fees.
If a jobs report falls in a closed market, does it make a sound?
At one point, after five House and Senate panels debated and passed the stadium plan, three had passed it on simple voice votes. In one of the two hearings where there was a roll call vote, forcing lawmakers to make their vote public, the plan failed.

McCafferty makes a pretty strong case for the Justice Center auditorium. It could easily seat more than 100 people, is accessible for the disabled, and connects to underground parking. It already has round-the-clock security -- a cost factor for night meetings. It is now used for sheriff's auctions, and Sheriff Bob Reid says that, with renovation, it could be put to other uses.
Hey, Mary Kay: I know that the Cowboys are looking to trade down to a later spot in the first round. What are the chances the Browns trade with them to obtain Michael Floyd and draft Richardson at 4? -- Zak Fleischman, Beachwood
Craig is going to be a big part of the 2012 team when his knee is right. He currently projects as their most dangerous bat on the bench but on top of that he figures to get his share of starts with veterans like Lance Berkman and Carlos Beltran needing time off occasionally.
Not everything in Wickenburg is horses and hiking. The Del E. Webb Center for the Performing Arts is a state-of-the-art 600-seat theater that presents an impressive range of artists and works.

But the total cost to run them was almost $68,000 -- the district covered $31,600 of that through the collection of "pay to play" student fees. Total expenditures last year were about $10,000 each for boys' and girls' golf, $12,000 each for boys' and girls' tennis, and $22,000 total for boys' and girls' water polo.
That they became the greatest private collectors of Dali's works, and, even more, became friends with the eccentric artist and his wife, Gala, seemed improbable in the 1940s when they were a young, newly married couple. Their interest in such controversial art scandalized their family and friends in conservative Cleveland.
The 27-year-old actress is the lone female in a crew of six superheros fighting to save humanity in "The Avengers," which opened Friday in North America amid speculation that it could break the box office record for an opening weekend.
But here's my problem: I'm starting to believe that legislation recently passed in the Ohio House and Senate that allows concealed carry in places that serve alcohol is a public safety measure that could grow in importance as Ohio's cities become less well-policed.
The World Health Organization, the American Medical Assn. and other major health groups have denounced the practice of feeding human antibiotics to animals. The mere threat that agricultural use could cripple drugs for people is reason enough to take action, they say.
David Ellis, a metallurgist at NASA, developed a custom alloy for rocket nozzles that could better stand up to intense heat. But he realized that the material could also be used by welding robots.
Senior guard Michael Schmidt (11.1 ppg), senior forward Jaylon Owens (10.3) and senior guard Jared Jones (9.1) have had to step up and produce more on the offensive end. Whenever Van Osdale comes back, the Maroons will be positioned to make some noise down the stretch.
The captain radioed to confirm where platoon members were and told Huff that the Predator was prepared to strike near a low-slung structure marked as Building 58 on detailed military maps "if it was still a viable target."

And while I’m on the dancing thing, what’s up with the Cowboys’ receivers stealing Cruz’s dance? First, it was Bryant in Week 14 and now it’s Robinson. I don’t understand why they feel the need to take it as their own. Niners CB Carlos Rogers doing it is one thing. I get it, he’s trying to mock the guy he was covering. Opposing receivers doing it doesn’t make sense at all. Also, Robinson’s version was horrendous.
Arthur Zielinski of Brick moved up his retirement from the Jersey City Fire Department by a month to ensure his benefits weren’t affected.
The president has ordered the Justice Department to review the law for potential civil rights violations.
Mitt Romney won a decisive victory in the Illinois primary yesterday, worthy of a victory lap on the TV news shows. Except that Romney’s senior adviser, Eric Fehrnstrom, came up with the wrong sound bite. It was a move akin to pulling out the wrong piece on “Booby Trap!”
A disco ball refracted light onto the haze of smoke that filled the back room, with its low ceilings and black-and-white checkered floor. Samantha Ronson was working the DJ booth, and girlfriend Lindsay Lohan was by her side.

* Wainwright is 66-35 in his career with a 2.97 ERA. He also served as an excellent closer in the 2006 run to the World Series championship. Wainwright finished third in the Cy Young voting in 2009, and second in the voting in 2010. As we told you, Cain is 69-73 with a 3.35 ERA and that's while making half of his starts in a pitcher-friendly home ballpark. In his last two combined seasons as a starter (before missing 2011 with the TJ surgery), Wainwright was 12 wins above replacement level. Cain over his last two seasons combined was about 8 wins over replacement level. Other than the three-year difference in their ages (with Waino being the older of the two) there is no way to make a case for paying Wainwright less than Cain. Perhaps we can haggle over length of contract, but if Cain is worth an average of $22.5 million a year, what will Wainwright fetch?
Still, more filler was needed, and some feather boas (one brown and one white cut into two pieces) seemed an inexpensive solution. The elements that were photographed can last for years. Staying power was a primary consideration.
Westerman, 43 and an 18-year bureau veteran, acknowledged he got out of his car during both encounters, but his accounts differ slightly.
Known as HOT (High-Occupancy Toll) lanes, the designated corridors began 15 years ago in California. Today, traffic-choked Orange County charges anywhere from $1.30 to $10.25 to use its 10-mile express lanes.

"Whether you knew him or you didn't know him," Garay said, "he affected a lot of people - friends, family, people that work within the organization, people from San Diego. You talk to a lot of people across the country, and I'm sure they're affected either by Junior the person or Junior the football player."
Stop laughing, we already know it’s a silly proposition, which is why it’s at the bottom. Mike D’Antoni doesn’t want to spend much time on defense, and if he does it his way again and the Knicks don’t win a round, it could be his ruination. The addition of Mike Woodson to his staff is supposed to give them some focus in this area, but it won’t really happen until the head coach wants it to happen.
She was elected to North Olmsted's council, a part-time job that pays about $12,000 a year, in 2005. Before that, she had been a U.S. Senate aide in Washington, D.C., and a Democratic precinct committee member in Parma, where she grew up.
Beyond benefits, critics of disenrollment say it can be psychologically devastating. "It destroys their connection to their ancestors, their cultural heritage, their tradition," said Laura Wass, the central California director for the American Indian Movement, an opponent of disenrollment. "You have to go to iron gates and beg for entrance to your own land."
France and Italy, Europe's second- and third-biggest auto markets, shrank by more than 20%. The regional drop was alleviated by growth at German carmakers, such as Volkswagen. Peugeot is among automakers forecasting an industrywide contraction of 5% in Europe this year.

But for all the detailed allegations contained in the complaint, the government's argument comes down to a general lack of oversight and the agency's apparent disregard for the concerns that its law-enforcement priorities were generating.
Mark Kiszla, Denver Post: "Not to put any undue weight on a 35-year-old neck that has undergone four recent surgical procedures, but after Manning notified the Broncos on Monday he's moving to the Rocky Mountains, expectations grew higher than Pikes Peak. Denver defensive end Elvis Dumervil declared Manning could transform a team that finished 8-8 last season into a dominant organization. Before the I's could be dotted on a contract for Manning, handicappers in Las Vegas put the Broncos alongside Green Bay, New England, San Francisco and New Orleans as legitimate Super Bowl contenders. Terrell 'Mr. 2,008 yards' Davis admitted a temptation to grab his cleats and come out of retirement. Not that anybody is getting carried away around here."
Below, 26, has pitched six years of pro ball and did well last year in Triple-A, as manager Jim Leyland emphasized Thursday. Smyly, 22, has pitched one year of pro ball and hasn't reached Triple-A.
But it ordered Proposition 8 sponsors to address in their opening brief due Sept. 17 whether they even have the legal right to try to have the trial judge's ruling overturned. Both California Gov.

Such attacks have raised doubts about the readiness of the Afghan government to take control of security as international forces draw down over the next two years. Afghanistan's international allies have stressed that they do not plan to abandon the country in 2014 and will provide the support needed to help Afghanistan protect its people. Most recently, the U.S. and Afghan governments agreed on a deal earlier this week for a U.S. presence in the country through 2024.

Both teams were playing the second night of back-to-backs, but the Cavs recovered more quickly. Of course, they did have the incentive of trying to make up for that horrible showing at Boston on Friday night. They jumped off to a 9-0 lead and were up, 28-14, by the end of the first quarter. Cleveland led, 40-20, midway through the second and settled for a 50-36 edge at halftime.

Twenty percent of responding companies said they wanted the Obama affordable health care act revisited, up from 8 percent a year ago. (The act is under review by the U.S. Supreme Court, with a decision expected in June.)
"There are a number of young players on our offensive line that we’re excited to see," Tannenbaum said. "Having Wayne Hunter back for another year, he’ll still be competing for a position here. And again, we've got three young guys we like in Caleb (Schlauderaff), Austin (Howard) and Vlad (Ducasse), so we’ll see how that goes. But we really did stick to our board. We took the highest-rated player on our board all three times."

At just 27 years old, Roy had to make the difficult decision to put his long-term health and family over the game he loves, ending what he called a "great ride."
That might be easier said than done. Reporting a corrupt official can be costly, said attorney John Ricotta. A building inspector can hold up a job and cost a company hundreds of thousands of dollars, Ricotta said. That creates a dilemma.

Moe and I arrive in time for the free tour that leaves twice daily from under the grandfather clock. Our guide takes us through ballrooms, around broad verandas and under the parabolic cupola - the Hemicycle - where chamber quartets once entertained the wealthy. We listen to stories about the ghost of the builder's wife and tales about the "Cave" - a Prohibition-era speakeasy in the basement - now renovated.
--UT Eric Sogard snapped an 0-for-13 streak with a single in the eighth inning Sunday at Tampa Bay, and he is 2-for-21 over his past five games. Sogard, the backup middle infielder and third baseman, is batting .148. He hit two homers in his first 12 games of the season. Last year, he hit two homers in his 27 games played with Oakland.
Yola: I think that people get married too young nowadays. They don't stop and think what married life is about. They've got to give and take. It's not just take all the time. I think they should wait till they get a little older. Because then your whole life is gone, you know? If you don't live a little bit when you're young, you're not going to enjoy anything.

Little wonder, then, that cacao made its way promptly back to Spain on Cortés' treasure-laden ships. The Spanish, once they discovered that adding sugar made the bitter drink more palatable, became devoted to xocoátl, keeping the recipe a secret for most of a century. In the 1650s a Frenchman figured out how to mill cacao into solid cakes, which made the drink easier to prepare. He opened a shop in London to sell his expensive novelty, and soon the moneyed class frequented fashionable chocolate houses all over the continent. The personal physician to England's Queen Anne added milk to the drink in the early 18th century — his recipe was sold to a London apothecary and then acquired by the Cadbury Brothers. In the mid-19th century, the Swiss invented a new blending process, and chocolate candy was born.

In what we would consider her mid-30s, Avice Benner Cho, part of the far-flung human diaspora, has returned to the planet where she was born. Brought up by minders in the ghetto of Embassytown, Cho, through a combination of luck and talent, got out. She became an Immer — a navigator needed to guide ships jumping through space — with demi-star status that has accorded her plenty of money, adventures and lovers. Cho has just married (third man, fourth time), and her new husband's keen interest in the Ariekei, the native creatures of her home planet, propels her there with him in tow.
"Even with an international roaming package on AT&T, it can cost 99 cents a minute or more for voice calls," said Philip Guarino, an international business consultant and founder of Elementi Consulting in Boston. "The moral of the story is, dump your American SIM card and buy a local one instead."

"That was a close as you're going to get to a real league game," Portland goalkeeper Troy Perkins said. "And (with) teams like that, that's what they rely on. They kick you and they battle for every little inch in the game. Sometimes, it's just a street fight and you've got to get through it."
Moments before, Watson stood in the thick forest to the right of the fairway, his Masters seemingly lost to his playoff opponent, Louis Oosthuizen. But Watson plays a Gumby-like version of golf, able to stretch shots around corners that seem square.

Swirsky offered the ball up on eBay last October for $1 million but got no takers. He said though that the eBay offering—done on a whim after he realized he could close the bidding on Oct. 25, 2011, the 25th anniversary of Buckner's famous error—made him realize he would be OK with selling his entire collection.

Losing Johnson, a proven recruiter and the staff’s senior assistant, hurts, especially to an ACC rival that courts many of the same prospects.

The schools need money. Yet the added expense of nearly $1,500 over five years is a significant sum for many people.
“The one thing that motivates me is that rough stretch in the ’70s, which was a torturous period for all of us, but especially him,” John Mara said. “The memories from those years still burn within me. I never want to go back to that. Yes, you’ll always have ups and downs, and you can’t win every year. But you can contend every year — the Patriots have been able to do it. The Steelers. It’s a place that we want to get to, and I think we can.”

More supportive of that storyline is the tale of the indignant women, House Democrats all, who recently staged a walk-out of a Republican-led "all-male hearing" on the mandate. That tale and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's tagline for it - "Where are the women?" - became national news. Not so widely reported was the fact that the "all-male" witness list actually included two women - a doctor and a lawyer, both serving in leadership positions in higher education and possessed of credentials considerably more relevant to a religious liberty hearing than those of the 24-year-old university student whom Democrats offered as their witness. Still, that student - not the expert witnesses against the mandate or the nearly 1,500 women from all walks of life who signed an anti-mandate protest letter on womenspeakforthemselves.com - garnered the press attention.

Complaining that this visa program — known as EB-5 — amounts to selling American citizenship reveals a misunderstanding of how our immigration system works. Our borders aren't like a deli counter where people take a number and wait their turn. We give preference, and always have, to people who are most likely to integrate easily into American society and to contribute the most to it. Skilled workers, people with advanced degrees or promises of employment, or those with family members already here get pushed to the front of the line. The reason the investment visa is known as "EB-5" is that there were already four other employment-based visa programs before it. The government allots 10,000 visas a year to the EB-5 program, or 7.1 percent of those allowed for all employment-based visas, though the quota has never been met.

Turmoil was in the air at another local institution as well, that being the state prison complex south of Hagerstown, as the state implemented, and then backed off, a policy of reviewing job applicants' social media pages. Tensions rose further as a union representative from a public employees union might have lost his temper at a gathering of correctional officers where they were discussing union dues.

A group of guards finally asked that the union rep be banned from prison grounds after he unfriended them on Facebook.

Briefly, Locke traces the use of children in epic poetry (exemplified in Wordsworth's line "the Child is Father of the Man") through the development of child characters in the Victorian novel. Locke takes up Dickens' work chronologically. He starts with Oliver Twist, a static saintlike figure, and follows with Dickens' autobiographical child character, David Copperfield, in which young David describes "his literary vocation as the ultimate -- and heroic -- civilizing force." Dickens' last child, stoic Pip in "Great Expectations," is a darker portrait, a child resigned to his fate.

Windows Phone's approach trumps the iPhone's unhelpful mosaic of app icons and it's also a more orderly solution than Android's desktop widgets. It's the single feature I missed the most when I switched back to my iPhone.

In 1905, R.C. married Mable Myrtle Crumb and over the course of the next few years was to father four children: Clarence (November 1905 - December 31, 1981), Raymond (died 1920), Harry (born January 27, 1916) and Mary Jane (born April 1922). When the Reviews bookkeeper died, R.C. took over that job and eventually became Frank's business manager. By 1919, R.C. had managed to accumulate enough money to buy into two newspapers with his brother. At that time, R.C. owned a one-third interest in the Review and a two-thirds interest in the Lorain, Ohio Times Herald. Several years later, he bought a third interest in another newspaper, the News of Mansfield, Ohio.
"First, IAEA inspectors are on the ground safeguarding Iran's enriched material and would detect any effort to divert it," said a senior U.S. official, who asked for anonymity while discussing intelligence. "Secondly, we have detected covert facilities in the past … and are confident we would do so again before Iran is in a position to use such facilities to produce enriched uranium."
Among other things, some researchers had been concerned about the wide variation in value-added results for individual teachers from year to year, the potential for error in the findings and the possibility that the results would be skewed by how students were assigned to classrooms.
Fact is, we're years away from figuring out what forms of "green energy" are commercially viable. Instead of throwing perfectly good tax dollars at today's technologies, perhaps Congress should put resources into basic research and development.

As of March, the aluminum-panel-clad skyscraper, where retailer Uniqlo is planning its flagship store, was about $3.5 million-a-month short on debt service, say people familiar with the matter.

Its revenues are only one-fourth the amount forecast in 2007.

* We'll probably write more about this later in the week but the Rams would likely benefit from trading the No. 2 overall pick sooner rather than later.

Rugg’s roll of the dice paid off. Falcone gave up just four hits and struck out 10 in a complete-game shutout to give Sea a 1-0, league-opening win over Iona Prep in CHSAA Class AA baseball Tuesday afternoon in New Rochelle. The Felician-bound senior mixed his devastating curveball, which he located perfectly, with a mid-80s fastball and retired 13 of the last 14 batters he faced.

"The defenders of the status quo will start chattering as soon as I leave this chamber. They’ll say the problems are not that bad; listen to me, I can spare you the pain and sacrifice," the governor said. We know this is simply not true. New Jersey has been steaming toward financial disaster for years due to that kind of attitude....For those who continue to defend the old ways of selfishly protecting turf, who stay in the corner defending parochial interests, please be on notice – people of good will who want a better, stronger New Jersey will band together to come into those corners and drag you to the center of the room to make our state the place we know it can be."

Gigot: Net zero. Net zero.
The voters' decision to unceremoniously toss out Dyer points up another fact as well: The silliness of the board's move to kick Dyer off the board by impeaching him. That impeachment process, still working its way through the system, was a nuclear option out of all proportion to Dyer's sins. More to the point, ousting Dyer was a decision best left up to the people who elected him. And, it turns out, that's exactly what happened.

More than anything, lingering injury issues have prevented Rose and Hamilton from jelling. To think those medical problems suddenly will disappear once the NBA calendar flips into postseason borders on blind faith. If Bulls officials honestly ranked team concerns as the regular season comes to a close, health might rank ahead of defense and rebounding. Last year the sight of Rose produced chants of "M-V-P!" This year, we think MRI.

The head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Cardinal-designate Timothy Dolan, told The Associated Press this week that his group would launch both legislative and court challenges to the health care mandate.
"For us defensively," forward Brian Conklin said, "you know what they're going to do, you just make sure you don't get caught with them back cutting and not fouling when they cut. We've had guys in the past get in foul trouble because they're putting hands on cutters and they've got fouls called on them. So you're definitely showing your hands when they cut, not getting backdoored, playing heels to 3, and making sure we pack off the right guys. Offensively, we have to be patient and know we're going to crash the boards because they're in a matchup zone so it's harder to box out. I definitely think we're going to rebound better than we have in years past. It's something we've come into ths season we haven't had in years past against Richmond. We've got a couple different tweaks to our offense that we like against Richmond this year."

The brilliant actor had been drowning so long in the swamp of drugs, booze, court appearances and prison that no one thought he could dry out and reclaim his career. Let alone front a major action-hero franchise. Then came the great surprise of 2008: Downey was not only lightning-quick clever, "Iron Man" was a fantastically fun movie, a slap in the face to the superhero genre.

John Margolies: Roadside America, edited by Jim Heimann (Taschen; 256 pages; $39.99). You know what the Bay Area landscape needs? A gas station made to look like an igloo, like the one in Ottawa, Kan. Or a diner to equal the steak house in Byron, Ga., that occupies the body of a DC-7. These 400-plus photographs are the legacy of one man's effort to document the freewheeling extremes of what gets built along commercial strips to make a fast-moving driver hit the brakes. Now such roadsides are the domain of franchised retail and design review boards, and it's our collective loss.

Chen's case, which has overshadowed a two-day conference here on U.S.-China relations, has all the makings of a Hollywood film in search of a happy ending. He has sought to stay and to leave, has criticized and then applauded U.S. efforts to help, and has reached out to the media and the U.S. Congress by cellphone  to make his case.

But none have had today's sophisticated technology to help, he said.
The 2.5-megawatt Kenersys turbine is the most visible example of Northeast Ohio's goal to bring wind turbine manufacturing here, beginning with Kenersys itself. To some extent, the effort will show whether Ohio can outmaneuver Michigan -- which has made a pitch to Kenersys and already has commitments from another turbine manufacturer to build in the Wolverine state.
If an individual who is not a hospital patient comes elsewhere on hospital property (that is, the individual comes to the hospital but not to the dedicated emergency department), an EMTALA obligation on the part of the hospital may be triggered if either the individual requests examination or treatment for an emergency medical condition or if a prudent layperson observer would believe that the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition. The term "hospital property" means the entire main hospital campus as defined in §413.65(a), including the parking lot, sidewalk and driveway or hospital departments, including any building owned by the hospital that are within 250 yards of the hospital).

The company had $2.6 billion in revenue last year and reportedly had 650 employees overall, though the number of workers at the Princeton Township offices on North Harrison Street was unclear late yesterday.
For Rockford it's just another big test in a season full of them. A healthy LaPrairie gives them the ability to throw the ball down field. LaPrairie was excellent against the Big Reds last season at 5th/3rd ballpark in a game won by Rockford 52-44. For Muskegon they wil have to use their speed, Lewis is a major factor, but Ryan Williams-Follins has proven to be a home run threat as a slot. Quarterback Princton Duncan will have to make good decisions, something he has done really well this season.

Answer: I think that he's kind of let his own narrative write him, rather than the other way around. He's the classic example of he hasn't decided to let this thing affect him in a good way, and that makes him an expert in people making bad decisions and letting things affect him in a bad way, which is why he's so good at homing in on what's wrong with Charlize, even though he can't apply that wisdom to himself.
The card was released in cigarette packs sold by the American Tobacco Co. from 1909-11. What makes the card special, in addition to Wagner's fame, is that it was pulled from circulation after about 200 were issued.

More English than England, novelist Anthony Trollope wrote when he visited here more than a century ago, and the scene, though picturesque, filled us with a wistful melancholy. So far from home, so deep their fealty to the crown, the early settlers tried to shape this country into something they might recognize -- even if it meant waging war against the Aborigines and tearing down the forests.

Coping with meanness, pressure from family
Launching these beers isn't cheap. Sundet wouldn't say how much A-B InBev will spend to market Platinum, but the official kickoff comes with two ads during the Super Bowl, where a 30-second spot averages $3.5 million. And that's just for starters. There will be billboards and big events - like last week's St. Louis launch party at the Chase Park Plaza's Starlight Room and a happy hour for Wall Street traders on Wednesday - buzz on the internet and a barrage of TV and radio ads to come. Steinman estimates A-B InBev shelled out at least $30 million apiece marketing Bud Light Lime and Golden Wheat in their launch years, and a similar plan for Platinum is likely.
