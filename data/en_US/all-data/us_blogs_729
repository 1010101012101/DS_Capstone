Finally, when she graduates and it is time for her to actually search for a job, she should 1) move to New York City (if she doesn’t already live here); 2) submit her resume as widely as possible to literary agencies; 3) give herself at least 6 months of searching (the biggest mistake candidates make is giving up after a few weeks or months); 4) not settle for a job which is not to her liking, or work for a boss who is unpleasant; and 5) apply for assistant jobs at book publishers if she cannot find one on the agency side. Working for a major book publisher is also great for the resume, and will help her land an eventual agency job. She should also remain open to the idea of working for the Subsidiary Rights departments of major publishers. This is something that few candidates consider, but which can end up being the most effective technique: it can be a much easier job to land, and literary agencies like to hire employees with Sub Rights experience, because many of the job duties overlap.
A boss who suspected a worker of theft decided to make an example of him.
We did get a little bit of snow yesterday, but it’s already melting today. There is a 40% chance of flurries this afternoon, but I doubt they’ll happen. The sky just isn’t gray enough.
“Ekneligoda often wrote about human rights issues, including workers’ rights and racial equality. There’s an investigation that began on 25 January, 2010, but to date there have been no arrests,” he said.
When I stopped being the martyr, when I stopped feeding off my regret and started living actively and accepting the consequences of the choices I’d made, doors opened. I’d never imagined that possible, but they did.
Again we don’t see the entire conversation, but we DO see Cruddas effectively setting out a “tariff” of benefits. The more you give, the more you get.
It had a light, subtle carbonation and a slight fizz that complemented very nicely the sweet citrus taste of lemon, grapefruit and more peach. There was even hints of some kiwi and gooseberry. These fruity notes were balanced very well by the breadiness of the malts that continued through to a lingering bitter-ish finish that left your thirst quenched and wanting more than just the one bottle of this lovely beverage.

Many families have a collection of their baby's clothing and blankets and struggle with what to do with them. Keep them boxed up? Pass them down to Rainbow siblings? Pass them on to others? It's a difficult decision when all we want to do is wrap our babies up in them and hold them close...
“How will I ever make it up to Cindy for that pesky 'whoops wrong hole' incident? Oh, hey now, FLOWERS!”, thought Gerald, as he whizzed past the lonely clown holding a sign indicating where one might buy roses.

Second – again – it’s all about the money. Fairness? Hatch does not think that word means what the fans think it means. I’m not seeing even lip service given to “settling things on the field”. Hatch could care less what a playoff looks like, as long as the SEC starts taking financial care of the WAC.

It’s always refreshing to help my friends, the college student in generating their minithesis. Especially for this one litle girl whose really stubborn and yet unbearabely clinging. Impatient, muzzy, and always search for an easy way out. Really resemble of certain someone in the past. Make me can’t stop yelling, because somehow I just can’t leave them alone. That certain someone, I missed him.
Well, here we are, October 3rd. You may remember from last week's update that I was wondering whether I'd make my 100 puppets by this date. I have to report that I didn't make it, and have only reached 95.

While sitting in the hot tub looking up at a full moon I had to wonder, how could anyone not enjoy their time in this magical area? Day two draws to a close with me thinking more positive thoughts about Tucson and my bead show experience. OH! I forgot I got to see the new venue for the Whole Bead show tonight, it looks great! I love the atrium, I think it's going to bring new exciting things to the show for 2013.
Scar on my forehead, about an inch long. The gash to the head came about the very moment I realised I couldn't fly. I was a two year old attempting a parkour style somersault over a bed (after getting lipstick applied and being all pleased with myself).
And then, since Batman's cape overlaps an empty night sky, it would have made no sense to keep his cape blank and free of interior lines. So Miller laid in some lines there to describe the form (and keep from having an empty space overlapping an empty space....that wouldn't be interesting and creates no sense of depth).
I will be back very soon but for now here's a picture I took in January when I was in dire need of a creative outlet - because being a graphic design student and working as a tshirt designer isn't creative outlet enough!

We started off on Monday counting by 10s. This was easy for most. I used a 100s chart to give a visual. We discussed that skip counting by 10 is the same as adding 10 (another Core Standard). I used these posters I found at homeschoolcreations.com as another visual. We played the game "I have, who has" and I had parents come to paint the kids' feet. The feet were used to create a giant number line in the hall. I can't believe I didn't take a picture of our finished product. I'll do it tomorrow!

sleep here, I’m thinking in my head) and some abandoned fields. There were no lights and we used torches on the narrow path between the fields to reach the little canal that was flowing parallel to the road. It must’ve been about 10 ft wide, maybe 12, with cemented sides and there were steps in the sloping bank just where we’d come out. I went back to fetch my clothes, asked him to watch my cycle, which wasn’t necessary, and though I trusted him, brought my wallet with me anyway. It didn’t have much money, but the cards would be a pain to replace. I watch the trucks, I’ll watch the bike, he told me, don’t you worry.

As kids, we used to use the resin tiles to play our version of Jenga (basically a wall made from the tiles!) but I finally sat down and learned how to play properly. It's essentially a noisy card game where you collect different combinations of suits. There is something very satisfying about slamming discarded tiles and shouting for tiles to complete your hand. I'm still getting the gist of the game (the scoring is the only thing that confuses me) but my grandma is a keen player and she loves that we now play with her!

So, we divorced. Not because of his driving, mind you, but you know. Anyway, I have always wanted to travel and I had to make a decision: settle being an arm chair traveler, or embrace my independence and travel solo. I chose the latter. I’ve watched my children travel all over the world. My daughter flew to Paris, stayed in a hostel by herself and made new friends to sightsee with. My son does the same. But, you have to understand that these are different times.

The routine my advisor and I have kept for the past two years has been more like this: I send her pages; she writes a note back summing up her general impressions with a list of specific concerns at the end. It sounds like I'll be getting the specifics as they appear in the margins, but the big picture, right when it really matters? That's what she won't be pulling together for me; she asked my permission, in a way, to be excused from that. I'm disappointed. If there was ever a time that the larger impression felt crucial -- but I can't worry about it. There just isn't anything more I can ask of her, so enough. I'll make do.

Jen was flying all over the country (7 schools = 14 flights) checking out possible Universities to teach at. She was fortunate to have so many schools wanting to fly her out to check out their school for her consideration. It was great that she had such a diversity in schools ~ and surprising to her that ones she thought she'd love, she really didn't and ended up falling in love with a last minute consideration. And because she is such an incredible person ~ I'm happy to report she received and accepted her first choice of schools, Salisbury University in Maryland. This will bring her (along with Jeremy and most importantly Charlie) under 3 hours from where we will be living. I am one happy GRAMMY/MOMMIE! I'm also incredibly proud of her and the work she has done and continues to do.
Gladys looked at the half eaten cupcake. She glanced at the now empty container of cinnamon hearts and the sucker string that lie on her desk. She looked up at Mrs. Perkins and then over at Brad. There was only one thing she could do. Yes she must do it to save herself. She raised her hand and covered her mouth with her other hand. Mrs. Perkins turned to Gladys “Yes what is it?” Gladys removed her hand from her mouth “I don’t feel so good.” Mrs. Perkins cocked and eyebrow and started walking back toward Gladys. Gladys gagged and choked. There was a moment of the whole class sucking in air then expelling it all at once in anticipation of the volcanic eruption that would happen next. Mrs. Wells jumped into action grabbed Gladys and pulled her through the back door. “Let’s get some fresh air” Mrs. Wells said as she drug Gladys into the afternoon sunlight.
In a zine, you might find typos, improper grammar, and brilliant or radical or just plain honest ideas that you don’t normally see in Time, Newsweek, or People. A zine can be about whatever subject its creator decides upon, or it may contain a variety of subjects and writing styles within the same issue. Zines can include personal essays, political discussions, fiction, craft or do-it-yourself advice, articles about music or movies, comics, poetry, reviews – anything under the sun, really. Zines are personal and idiosyncratic. The best thing about zines is this: There are no rules.

Fate has not been kind to Martin Luther King’s birthday. First, the creation of a national holiday on that date met with persistent and perverse resistance from a wide variety of reactionaries (some of whom now try to swim in the mainstream). But with most of those battles far in the past, who would have thought that his monument in Washington (once it was finally authorized) would prove controversial? And that this controversy would come to a head on the eve of the next celebration of that holiday?

After looking into it there seemed to be a lot of lighting options to consider. So I did a little research .....I drove over to my Mom's and asked what she had. :-) After some inspection it turns out she had Xenon lights. It's what her super awesome contractor recommended, and I kind of trust everything he picks. So, that was easy. The colour Xenon lights cast is fabulous, and after a google search, it turns out The Home Depot has them. Whoop!

That being said... I never got upset. And I never got excited. For some reason I knew that it would be over incredibly fast. I don't feel like I was being pessimistic. It wasn't like I was sad...just a strong instinct that it something was off. In fact I didn't even tell Brian until a good 12 hours after I took the test. He was briefly excited but I think my blasé attitude about it made him react the same way. So when it was negative the next two mornings we both just kinda shrugged our shoulders and laughed at our luck. Yeah, we laughed.

The tours, whether you do the Wharf Wander through to the Extreme Ghost Tour are always informative. We took the Adult Ghost Tour, armed with lanterns, we wondered around the buildings said to be haunted. Apparitions are rare other than a Chinaman called Mr Chen, a small girl with braids and the undertaker who watches over the Mortuary through to the hospital. A stern Matron has also been seen walking the hallowed halls of one of the hospital wards and actually inspired a story I wrote for the River of Mnemosyne on Tenth Daughter of Memory. Orbs are common, voices and footsteps and our shuttle driver even said he'd felt a pin prick in his wrist, similar to that of an intravenous line being injected.
I celebrate Mother’s Day because being a mother is an incredible gift. But during this weekend of celebration, I want to reflect on loss and grief, because all of our lives are shaped by it. We find it difficult to talk about, even though it is a common denominator that sexual orientation. Grief and loss mold us in ways seen and unseen. On Mother’s Day each year, I mourn even as I celebrate.

“But then 2008 Score Select comes along and now there are three autos per box and I had become an avid trader on an online trading site called Trading Card Central. That made it a little easier to aquire more of my wants and add a little more of the autos to my collection. In 2009, there was no more Score Select but a new version called ‘Inscriptions.’ Man, I was bummed. I wasn’t thrilled about it at first but over time it slowly grew on me and I decided to go full force on trying to get not only the parallels and inserts from all the previous years, but also adding the autos as well. Here I am today with a collection that I am proud of and am still trying to expand.

During his remarkable campaign for President, Barack Obama was positioned as the next Great Man in American political history. He was marketed as an icon, and comparisons to Martin Luther King, Jr. were commonplace. There are certainly many parallels between the political paths of Obama and King: they led sweeping grassroots movements in the face of local and national criticism. They both reflected America’s hope for the possibilities of the future, and both proclaimed a personal dedication to human rights. When Obama clinched the election, he seemed poised to be remembered as the next Token African-American Leader, the historical successor of MLK, Jr.

I was 15, on the beach with a couple of friends having a nice, leisurely evening stroll when this bloody Great Dane came bounding up, full of frisk, tongue lolling happily, clearly sensing he had found a playmate in the dopey tart who greeted him with friendly enthusiasm and an invitation to “Go fetch!”. Unfortunately, for me, something must have been lost in translation, maybe he really was from Denmark, because he blatantly ignored the stick I had thrown for him and instead decided I was an intriguing mix of lamb chop and a really big chew toy, clamped jaws that suddenly didn’t seem quite so chummy around my arm and proceeded to shake me like a Polaroid picture. At first I just laughed, thinking it was all a bit of fun, he just wanted to play. But then I noticed that what I had at first taken to be a bit of a goofy grin that only dogs and Tony Blair are capable of, was in fact more of an aggressive snarl. Also that my friends were looking most uneasy as they started to back away. I chuckled nervously and suggested that he might like to let go and then we could have a really super game of fetch.

He takes a deep breath and raises his head from his hands. He stares at the lawn, thoughts still stuck in the past few moments. He starts to tell her what happened. He tells her of his dad threatening to shoot him. How they brutally fought. How the gun fell from his hand and clattered to the floor. He, being the sober one, retrieved it before his father could. He spoke of how his dad, once more, charged at him, hands raised ready to clench around his throat. He remembers the feel of the gun in his hand and the pull of the trigger. He does not remember raising it though, or aiming it, but the bullet went straight to the area he always assumed a black hole remained where a vital organ should be. In that instant he learned his father did have a heart, and he sent a bullet right through it.

Elspeth is woken by the door of her room crashing open, and having a girl younger then herself try to tell her that she is here to ‘warn her’, but it is obvious that the poor girl cannot ‘think straight’ and has trouble expressing her thoughts. She has obviously had some sort of trauma or mental illness, judging by her erratic behaviour. Using her mental abilities, Elspeth was able to connect with the girl’s mind and found out her name was Selmar. Elspeth could tell that her mind was basically destroyed, from some incident, which makes me wonder what happened to her. The scene is made worse with the arrival of a ‘girlish’ young boy, who seems to torment and ridicule Selmar, whose reaction to his arrival is one of fear. He acts like he has authority, when he is probably only 11 or 12. He is a devilish, cunning and malicious boy. He is someone I will have no trouble hating.

WOW! Last bnight was so much fun! We were all alone and Momma was getting ready for bed when Daddy said "W hat is that sound"? Course we had to go look and believe me it was loud this deaf lady heard it. We looked outside the patio door and low an behold ther was ICE coming down outside.

So, if we want to get into the Olympic spirit, perhaps we need to think in terms of films about sport and concentrate on the ones that actually appear at the Games. Sadly, sports movies don’t always enjoy the best of reputations. Three words say it all: Escape To Victory.

“The condition of mind described as depravity of mind is characterized by an inherent deficiency of moral sense and integrity. It consists of evil, corrupt and perverted intent which is devoid of regard for human dignity and which is indifferent to human life. It is a state of mind outrageously horrible or inhuman.”
So I for one do not believe there is such thing as a “national interest” a nations interests are bound up in a class based society whose interests are polar opposites.
Since the makers of the program still haven't found the hairy monster, I decided to take my digital camera into the woods and capture an image of ol' Sasquatch himself.

Since I was starting these at 10pm and I needed to be up at 5am the next morning (ugh!), they had to be quick and clean. I used Photoshop to print the letters on the black/white boards and resized the images to be about 3"x3". I printed the images on my Epson 3800 which prints in pigment ink, heat set them then colored with Copics. I used some simple layers of DP from the "Playdate" paper pack from Stampin' Up- so perfect for school related cards and scrapbook pages! A die cut layer for the image, a few buttons, some red striped twine and it was done- super fast!

Right away, life began to change. Not necessarily for the good either. I have posted about my old GM. It was at the beginnign of 2010 that he started doing things, threatening to fire us, firing managers and replacing them with minimum wager people, cutting hours, and so on.

In the UK, at least, Doctor Who never was a cult show, or, at least, it wasn’t supposed to be. Its traditional Saturday evening slot was, as we’ve discussed before, a family slot such that Doctor Who was something the whole country watched. And even if it had been, the cosplay and fanfic aspects of fandom that define it in most people’s minds were American inventions that hadn’t migrated to the UK yet. UK Doctor Who fandom was, for a long time, an altogether different beast, and the fandom that leads to the quasi-official or outright official positions of involvement in the series remains so.
The problem is that it isn't immediately obvious to a lot of otherwise kind and thoughtful people that illegally downloading DVDs and CDs isn't a victimless crime either, just a different order of crime in which the victim is removed from the perpetrator by several degrees.
I am far more interested in other people’s cosmetic choices than my own, so here’s where I start putting the spotlight on other awesome Landroval players!
The pub was originally owned by Rhymney and later Whitbread breweries but today it is a welcoming free house. The pub was first mentioned in 1861 when it was known as the 'Hen and Chickens Inn'. There is a village of Great Witcombe in Gloucestershire and a nearby pub is called the Gloucester Arms, the connection being that this area of Aberdare was built on the glebeland of the nearby St John's Church, founded around 1200, which was owned by the Dean and Chapter of Gloucester. The Gloucester location has dropped its 'h' in recent years.
There really isn't much to the challenge, but it's not easy. You log all of your food, make sure you eat a green veggie each day, cut out the sugar (read labels to make sure!) and do at least 30 minutes of exercise each day. See, not bad, but today I had the worst headache. From the lack of sugar, perhaps? I really didn't think I had that much sugar in my diet. Interesting, huh?
just isn't sexy.
Things have been happening here. Flowers. Like crazy. Weddings of friends and strangers. Coffees and hangovers and 6am flower market runs every other day. Pizza more often than not. 24 dirty flower buckets waiting for me in the bathtub. 10 large cardboard boxes of fancy vases in the living room. 6 weddings in September. 3 gorgeous, massive cast iron urns stolen from my hallway. 2 accidentally thrown away pairs of expensive clippers. 1 very special vintage umbrella taken at a bar and lost for all time.

Baker took no account of the aggressive way in which the US authorities seek to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction, for example in seeking the extradition to face trial of people who have never set foot in the United States. Nor did he recognise the huge difference between standing trial in your own country, with full access to such things as bail, financial support and family, and being hauled off to a foreign land, there to be treated as a fugitive from justice. To someone who may in fact be not guilty, the trauma and life disruption that will inevitably result from such an experience cannot be wiped away by an acquittal. Even where guilt is clear, the process of extradition is often in itself wholly disproportionate to the offence. Nor should it be forgotten that the sentences imposed by US courts, and the prison regime itself, are often much tougher than those in the UK.

Ethan Day has certainly done his research into life in the 50′s and it shows without it coming across like an information dump. When Zachary (and the reader) land in Los Angeles circa 1958, the surprises are endless and sometimes very funny. Stereophonic Hi Fi is new and wonderful, Coke is Coke, and gas “costs a friggin’ quarter”. And the lack of the internet and Star Bucks come as an unhappy surprise to a young man accustomed to the everyday pluses of life in 2008. Oh it’s so great to tag along with Zachary as he visits the West Hollywood Sears store and has to pick out pants that most certainly aren’t low riders! Ethan Day’s deft touch with comedy is everywhere without overwhelming the dark and angst filled romance behind A Token In Time. Ethan Day brought the 50′s vividly back to life so much so that I was reaching for the iTunes store before the end of the book to recapture the sounds of the times.

That was a few weeks ago, and since then, we've come up with a name (let me give a shout-out to Ryan, follower of this blog, for suggesting the title!), set up a blog, and are working on that in preparation for a launch in early December.

Unabashed–seriously, this film doesn't know the meaning of the word "abashed"–in its depiction of a vacuous wasteland where career boosting intercourse and nasal cavity destroying narcotics are the only true currencies, esteemed filmmaker Rafal Zielinski (Screwballs), making excellent use of his much celebrated eye for colour, creates a world filled with pastel vistas and lace-covered thighs. In order to mask the sheer righteousness of his film's feminist outlook, Rafal peppers every other scene with moments that will placate the genital-based urges of all the undiscerning heterosexual men in the audience.

Kevin Kyle remains in the club canteen where he has been for nearly a year and will no doubt sit until his retirement this Summer. He had surprised most Hearts fans with what he provides to a team but he came with such high risk in terms of injuries, they can’t be surprised. I think it’s time he was given the Lenny ‘Of Mice and Men’ treatment out the back at Riccarton. With Calum Elliot and Gary Glen out the door, that really leaves only Stephen Elliott as the recognised striker in the line up.
USPTO MOVES TO CURB CONTINUATION PRACTICE AND FORCE APPLICANTS TO HELP STREAMLINE PATENT PROSECUTION: The USPTO recently announced a bold proposal to overhaul the patent examination process by sharply limiting an applicant's discretion to file continuations, and further requiring applicants to identify "representative claims" to the Office prior to examination. Each of these proposals will be discussed in more detail below.

Linden stood frozen in indecision. He really should let Bennett know what Katie had said. He looked toward the table where she was chatting with some kid whose name he didn’t know, her back turned toward him. What if she was spreading it around? If she was, he couldn’t do anything to stop her, but at least if he knew what she was saying and how people were taking it, he could tell Bennett and maybe he could figure out how to make it stop. He carried his tray over and nudged the boy sitting next to Katie.

Ezra Levant, who lost a lot of time and money fighting off spurious Section 13 complaints, noted six months ago that the CHRT had suspended penalties under Section 13, but not investigations and prosecutions. This appears to put an end to all of it. Warman can appeal to the courts, but they may be reluctant to reverse the CHRT’s eviscerating of its own jurisdiction.

Werner unleashes not only flesh hounds, but also blood letters. The weapons that many of the characters use, are demonic in nature and destroy both body and soul.

You know you came up, what what makin it happen
Last night I had a friend over and we discussed some of the changes that are happening in my business (for new readers, I'm a freelance designer) the changes are good (I'm growing!) and positive. There are many new things coming my way and as I spoke out loud as to what these projects are, I began to panic inside. Am I really doing all of this? I'm writing a book. It's a joke of a book but at the same time I'm being serious about it. (I can't discuss much more than that) I'm expanding my clients and solidifying some with contracts which means steady income but at the same time steady work load. I work full time too. 8-5 am. plus nights. Oh, and I'm blogging too.... see where the stress begins?
Aside from the characterization, this film is also laughably bad in many aspects where I don’t even think it intended to be. The melodrama gets kicked up to about 100 here and at times, almost feels like it’s making fun of itself but that’s the thing, it’s dead serious. There are so many corny scenes where these characters start to have realizations about one another and how beautiful that other person is and the sweeping score just comes in booming right in your ears and it just gets even worse as the film starts to dive deeper and deeper into this schmaltzy material.
In truth, she is the perfect student; any teacher should love such a student in their midst to stimulate discussion and challenge established traditions- and they do until it goes against their own believes.
I have been trying to work through a project, a rewriting of a project. There are bits of this that are working and then large sections that fail. It's totally depressing. I shouldn't be here writing about it but I am. Plus today Elizabeth Taylor died. I just watched Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? again and all week have been walking around my house, declaring "What a dump!" and then asking, "What's that from?"
- Respect other people’s opinions and suggestions. Rural folks are unique: They will more often than not come up with the simplest solution to a problem (but don’t think these folks are “simple” for a minute). By allowing them to voice their views, opinions, or methods of doing you’ll also build cohesiveness by allowing these folks to identify as part of the tribe. Simply put when people feel valued as a member of the team they become a more loyal member of the team.

Third, relator contends that unlike the inequitable conduct claim featured in Exergen, false marking is “anonymous” and is not an individualized fraud. . . . Overlooked by the relator is that the naming of specific individuals is not the only way to set forth facts upon which intent to deceive can be reasonably inferred. In an amicus brief, the United States points out that a relator can, for example, allege that the defendant sued a third party for infringement of the patent after the patent expired or made multiple revisions of the marking after expiration. None of these or similar assertions are present in the complaint here.

Most of us don’t think of the food we eat as poison, but some of the ingredients commonly found in processed foods can be considered toxic. By “toxic,” I mean chemicals or highly processed ingredients that aren’t good for you or can cause harm to your health. I’m talking about refined grains, trans fats, high fructose corn syrup, and all the other artificial junk you can’t even pronounce on the ingredient lists. Any food that has been canned, dehydrated, or had chemicals added to it is a processed food, and these foods make up about 60 percent of the average American diet. They’ve taken over, and we have to FIGHT BACK. Know which toxic food ingredients to avoid:

Remember dear souls, there is no such thing as concrete ‘real or ‘fake’ dualities here in the higher realms. Everything just is, and everything one can ever think of or possibly imagine already exists. This is in fact true also with the lower dimensions. It is simply your beliefs in such concrete dualities that make them real. Even the most recent predictions that many dismissed as being illegitimate, are certainly real events that exist and that manifested in another reality on Earth.

At the 34th km, before crossing the bridge to Marina Barrage, I felt a prickle on my right inner thigh (there must be some Latin name for the specific muscle, I'm sure). It's the familiar sensation I get when I do longer runs. Sometimes, it would disappear but unfortunately, on that day, the pain worsened. Who would have thought that a tiny piece of cramped meat like that could affect one's performance? Well, it did. Running, from that point on, felt like driving a car with one locked wheel. I had no choice but to slow down, constantly and rhythmically swinging my right leg to reduce the pain. I gulped two packs of energy gels and had cups of isotonic drinks, hoping to level the amount of potassium in my body, which may (or may not) ease the cramp.

It is hard to find accurate worldwide figures, but contrast the above statement with the fact that by the end of 2007 there were nearly 1,400 hectares planted in Australia, more than 1,100 hectares in California, 700 hectares in Argentina and 270 in Chile – not to mention the 700 or so in France’s Rhône Valley and another 1500 in the Languedoc. This is a grape that has really found a market in the last twenty years or so.

It doesn’t feel like deprivation, it feels natural, satisfying, clean, and pure. It’s about respecting my body, being thankful for this vessel God gave me, and taking care of it as best I can.

Paleolithic eating, for those of you who don’t know, is a type of eating that mimics the habits of our ancestors. The ways people fed themselves before there was high fructose corn syrup and highly processed candy bars. It comprises a diet high in (good) fats with plenty of protein and not so many carbohydrates.

Walker is easily one of the most notorious mayors of New York, but today we can appreciate his brashness, his independence and class, just as we can lament his subservience to diabolic Tammany-era politics. He wasn't the last disgraced mayor the city would see in the 20th century, but his abdication neatly defines the modern era's defining fall from grace.
I think for marketers considering the usability of a website is important for ensuring the goals of the website are achieved. The difficulty is balancing the user expectations and the goals. Yet, with developing the website for the target audience(s), it is more than likely the company will be able to achieve its objectives. One of the main reasons a company has a website is to attract visitors that will be converted into leads and customers.

Due to “Obama’s” destruction of the dollar and insane mandates, many states refuse to accept the authority of any federal branch of government, or any local authority who invokes federal authority, in order to reign them in. These states do not formally declare independence, so they cannot be said to be in a state of rebellion. There are so many points of non-obedience around the country, and “Obama” has so exhausted the treasury and the agencies of armed force at his disposal, that he is impotent to do anything, and the nation disintegrates. Different states and regions then formally declare independence, with some engaging in forced population transfers, while others stick with what they have. (Think the early 1990s in the Soviet Bloc and its aftermath.)
Iraq is over (for us) and Afghanistan seems to be not too far behind. It was only a few years ago that joining the Army meant a guaranteed deployment. It was not a matter of if but when. Training was tailored to the operating environment. COIN was the name of the game.

Start by making the filling. Trim the thick fat rind off the sirloin, cut it into chunks and put it in a food processor. Add salt, pepper and the chopped parsley to taste. (it tastes great raw so don't be afraid). The pureéd beef needs to be really well seasoned, but not too salty.
Well, I guess I should have designated this Bunny week! LOL When I went searching for free bunny clip art I obviously found a couple of cute ones that I thought would make quick and easy cut files to share here on my blog. I guess I need to see if I can find one more to finish out the week tomorrow! LOL Or maybe I will just use one of these other ones on something new! We shall see! I actually can't believe I got several posts done all in a single week so we will see if I can get one more done to make it a full week! That would be a first! LOL
He did that full time and in the summers he also worked landscaping with his cousin. In 2007, we made the big move down to Charlotte when the economy was not the best, so Joe found work with a landscape/hardscape company to start getting a paycheck. This job fueled his passion for working outdoors and he loved the fact that you could do this profession year round unlike Ohio where it really is seasonal. After getting certified in hardscapes Joe made the move to a waterscape company where he learned all about building ponds/waterfalls/etc. Joe fell in love with the waterering aspect of landscape and spent 2 years fine tuning this craft.
What's more, it's a succinctly atmospheric affair, more akin to the ambient soundscapes of Agaetis Byrjun or () rather than its predecessor's fluent pop stylings. It's an album that will delight long term devotees of the band while re-establishing them as a creative force to be reckoned with, some eighteen years after initially forming.
I received a complimentary eARC of this book from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for my honest review.
On their own, these guys are pretty blah. But for $1 for 3, how can you go wrong. A little bit of makeup should pretty these up, so off to work I went! I bought 18 more spice jars at Dollorama and used Krylon metallic spray paint I had on hand to paint the lids (Is this foodsafe? Not sure, but the spray paint is only on the outside, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed). I did 3 light coats and they came out perfectly. I toyed with the idea of using blue spray paint but decided silver would give me the look I was going for.
Opposition parties in the municipality voiced their outrage at the alleged abuse of council property. The DA’s Mark Steele said the problem has been going on for some time. He said councillors of all the political parties have raised the issue with the municipal manager and officials.
It is also important to note that RAND’s analytical errors were not just those of commission — excessive mathematical reductionism — but also of omission. As Abella notes, “In spite of the collective brilliance of RAND there would be one area of science that would forever elude it, one whose absence would time and again expose the organization to peril: the knowledge of the human psyche.”

But I'm confused. New Belgium, like the Belgian breweries it imitates, always makes a serving temperature recommendation on the bottle. The 2 Below bottle recommends that it be drunk very cold — 37 degrees. (Most of their beers come with recommendations of 45 or 55.) This is strange for two reasons: First, excessive cold numbs your tastebuds and kills the taste of beer. Second, why in the hell would you want an almost-freezing beer in winter? To get even colder?

Yet to my mind, the recording of an album appears to be a largely intimate process. After all, only few were privy to the goings-on of those small sound-proof rooms in North London, New York City and Gothenburg. We can only get so close to understanding the creative process of another person. That understanding seems to be diminished especially when it touches upon the creation of something that we hold in considerably high esteem.
Both of them echoed the same sentiment. Don't mess around. Call 9-1-1. So I did.

There are two little drawers full of fused scraps in my studio. To begin I created a pieced background with 5 irregular strips of dark fabrics. From my stash I pulled out a gray, dark print, blue, red and green fabrics of a similar dark value, pieced them together. This is not an attractive background but it is interesting.

I have friends who insist that anything beyond personal scripture study is an exercise in selfishness, and I used to feel so guilty that I desperately wanted more time to myself outside of that thirty minutes of reading scriptures each day. With my recent realizations, I have to admit that they are lying to themselves. Each of those friends who exhorts the "scripture study only" method of re-charging themselves--each one of them is obese. I recognize that it's rather harsh of me to point that out, but they've made me feel guilty for years about the healthy desire for personal re-kindling outside of scripture study while they cart around the obvious unhealthy results of their narrow-minded opinion. Why do I allow myself to mold my life to cater to the ridiculous opinions of other people?
Even within Christianity, shameless perversion is promoted a “holiness” in the name of Jesus. The ultimate fruit of Replacement theology is lawlessness.

An excellent piece of scientific history, and a compelling case for making scientific journal and magazine archives accessible to everyone. When the 166-year-old Scientific American opened up it’s digital archives for a trial period, its editor, DiChristina, revealed how the magazine ran an editorial in support of Marie Curie in 1911 — the year she received her second Nobel Prize, and also was rejected from joining the French Academy of Sciences. “When science comes to the matter of bestowing its rewards it should be blind to the mere accident of sex,” states the editorial. Sadly, the statement is arguably no less true 100 years later as it was then.

We expect a difficult situation to change and for things to turn in our favor. At times our changes are critical. We lose our focus and get sidetracked along the way. When life hangs in the balance, we sometimes lose our perspective of God. Nothing is more evident about the nature of things than that they change.

“10 – The scriptures have deceived us into thinking we need to do something to be justified and pleasing to God, even though according to Calvinism, man is depraved and cannot do a good act in the eyes of God. Therefore we are told on one had to have faith and this is enough to be justified by a legal process, yet we are also told men cannot do an act pleasing to God, so God justifies man, even though He is not pleased with men’s acts. What’s a man to do to be justified after all? Does he have to do an act pleasing to God and if so, is this is a meritorious act? (Yep!) If not, then why does man have to do any act at all to receive justification, when the perfect sacrificial substitute has already been made?”
A critical problem that may arise is that not all broadband plans are the same, and service providers will overload networks in order to maximize their profits.

And so much more, if I put even more thought into it. The build-up to the retreat was the worst, though. A year before my first retreat I was too young to attend one but a few of the other students around my age managed to go because they won a forms competition within the school. When they returned they had all of these fantastic stories and I wanted nothing more than to live something similar myself. To my dismay, a year takes a very long time to pass, but eventually it was my turn to be eligible and attend as well. I was unsure about what to expect but I knew it was going to be a great experience.

As I said last week, things have been a little crazy. Right now I have a lot of irons in the fire, both professionally and personally, and I’ve been waiting to see how they all pan out. Well, three of those things came to a bit of resolution this week—one turned out as I’d hoped it would and the other two didn’t. (I found this all out on the same day, btw.) Is it the end of the world because they didn’t? No. I knew deep down that the two which didn’t work out were simply a couple of speed bumps in my life and that I just have to deal with it. But at 2 o’clock on Tuesday—(Valentine’s Day, of course!)—I wasn’t quite looking at it that way. I felt old, unloved, unwanted, discouraged, and just generally ticked at the Universe for messing with all my well laid plans. (Yeah, right “of mice and men…” and all that!) I was in the throes of the biggest pity party I’d had in a long time.

The following week, after the church service, I sit on the front pew, waiting for Anna to finish the Benediction. Tony sits down on the front pew and we talk for a minute or so. With a smile on his face he tells me he’s married, and I say, “I know” and keep talking. Tony’s expression changes to anger, but he doesn’t say a word. He stands up suddenly and leaves. I think to myself, “Wow – that was abrupt!”

I have had to squeeze an extra 15-20 hours' work into each week - to visit my dad, take him to hospital appointments, have conversations with doctors and social workers, and do all sorts of other bits and pieces. The Care Service people are 'not allowed' to do task that is medical, because they're not trained for it. Fair enough. But I haven't had any training either, yet it still falls to me to sort out my dad's medications and oxygen. More annoyingly, they're 'not able' to do his shopping either, though you definitely don't need special training for that. So it falls to me to do that, too. Hmm. Perhaps in a way it's lucky he's stopped eating.
I want to thank all of you for the supportive comments that you left me. It was tough for me. I took some time to put it into perspective and I walked back into work on Monday confidently with my head up. I am going to chalk it up to looking at the source.

However, comparing the price I paid for rentals versus the price of new showshoes on the internet, if my kids used them TWICE it would have been more cost effective to have just bought them. Plus, the rentals at the Nordic center don't come with poles. They don't have any collapsible or kid-sized poles. Most of the snowshoes for sale online come with poles. Given the snow that dumped around our house this week and the 3 snow days the boys had off of school, I'm sure they would have used them just to walk around outside the house this week.

And once instances occur that you simply won’t be able to pay the total from the time you announced, there are actually those businesses that may even offer you to flip the Loan. flip essentially implies you can expand the procedure of reimbursement of a particular a part of your entire mortgage for an additional pair thirty day period further more. While of course you have to pay particular interest charges so your flip is going to be thanks to.

One interesting line I liked in the movie is when the heroine tells the hero that she is full of contradictions being a human and a cat at the same time. The hero replies back that normal humans are also full of contradictions. How true! And then towards the end of a movie the heroine develops compunctions about eating a live bird. Her sister, a cat admonishes her pointing out the hypocrisy of humans who savor chicken but feel revulsion at the idea of cats eating live birds.

Now, when I go visit Joni and Griff, the most awesome booksellers on the planet, I feel an unremitting urge to take treats with me. I've been staying out of the kitchen this week due to my abundant baking last week, so I really wasn't prepared nor in a planning state of mind. I'd been idly catching up on my food magazines this afternoon after finishing work and I recalled I'd seen an interesting and simple cake called a French Yogurt Cake. I grabbed the Bon Appetit that I'd been perusing and flipped through until I found it. It was a recipe with lemon...and I had one lemon....and I had Greek yogurt and I had everything else required...pretty basic cake. It called for a tablespoon of fine lemon zest and I only had one lemon...but I had a lime. I figured I could add the two together and that would work. I, of course, wanted petite bites for the bookstore visitors, so I decided I could do mini cupcakes with this batter. I wasn't sure what to do for a topping - the cake in the magazine was just a loaf cake - no glaze or anything. Huh, well, I could figure that out later. It was 7:30 on a Friday night and I wanted to get these baked off so I headed to the kitchen.

My own election preference aside, though, these examples to me show the shortcomings of PolitiFact's reductionist, all or nothing approach. "Facts" are relatively easy to check. "Truth," which requires their interpretation, is often in the eye of the beholder.
When producers drop age statements from their labels, they always swear the product is still as old as it used to be but that inevitably changes. So if you see a bottle of Weller Special Reserve that says '7 years in wood,' buy it, because the new ones don't say that.

Television is now following a similar evolution, albeit in a roundabout fashion. Broadcast TV started out as free to its viewers. With just a few channels in any given broadcasting area, advertising rates were high and very profitable. But then Cable TV, and later Satellite Dish TV, arrived with dozens of channels being made available to the average viewer. This caused advertising rates per viewer to start falling like phone rates.

I remember when I first felt this new level of intense fear that I'd never known before- even in all the hard times I'd survived in my life. We were in the hospital, Teagan was just a day or two old. We were faced with bringing her home and I realized I wouldn't have a nurses' call button at home. I wouldn't have immediate help and answers and experienced hands to step in and help. And when I felt that helplessness, I suddenly dipped my toe into this ocean of fear that I had never known before.

Sorry about the dull lighting. The swatches of the lipstick are actually the best ones, and are truest to color. I haven’t tried these products out for long so I don’t think I can give an accurate review of their quality yet. But I do like them so far.
Okay, don’t act like you don’t know what I’m talking about here. The whole “my turn vs. his turn” debate goes on in almost every person’s head at the beginning of getting to know someone. You don’t want to seem pressed so you don’t call the other person until they’ve called you back, or you don’t want to seem extra eager so you make sure that you weren’t the last one to initiate something between the two of you before initiating something this time. But when you head into the dating stage, you forget all that nonsense. You want to talk to him – so you call. You want to see her – so you ask her to join you. Simple as that.

These people are salt of the earth. I know there are those who are loud and more brash than others but every country has its share of people like that. It would be incorrect to regard all South Africans as such because of those few individuals. In South Africans in London the interviewees talk about life in London, their social lives, business, about friends and family in London as well as back in South Africa, about property, accommodation, European countries (and their citizens arriving in London searching for employment just as the Kiwis, Australians and South Africans do), sport, networking, emigration, children and schooling, health care and transport.

As I turned onto the long and curvy street—my first time doing so, mind you—I was immediately charmed by the tight Victorian architecture fencing the road.

Archaeology was introduced in Cataclysm as a new secondary profession, added to the existing ones of: cooking, fishing, and first aid.

The benefits are mainly monetary from selling what you make, but also offer some fun vanity and other useful items.
Doppelbocks have a cool history, emanating from its creation by the Paulaner monks in the 1600′s as a type of “liquid bread” to be consumed during the Lenten fasting period.

Holiday From Real
About 20 minutes went by and our fish dinners arrived. I ordered Mac and Cheese as a side dish. As you can see, the fish was thin, and skinny. The breading was adequate but a little soggy. It had a “Fishy” smell to it which to me means it was not as fresh as it could be. The taste was OK. Certainly not what I had expected as several people told me about the place. The Mac and Cheese was cold.
You want my sales. That's a statement, not a question. Or if you're dreaming even bigger, you want John Locke's or Amanda Hocking's sales. You want to make enough money to retire within the next 12 months. And you've dropped by my blog to learn how.
Even more miraculous, Donnie, who has not been able to tolerate any form of girth or surcingle without erupting in a panic attack/bucking fit for the last 4 years, is now able to be saddled normally and will trot relaxed on the longe, stretching long and low and licking and chewing the whole time.

When I was sixteen I met my husband. By eighteen we were married. When we decided to marry right out of high school I had no idea how many questions we would field from friends and family. Everyone wanted to know why. What was the driving force behind our desire to marry so young? People were fascinated and confused.
Yet long before the ‘Last Son of Krypton’ leapt into comic books, the New York Journal-American newspaper unveiled a new comic-strip character on 17 February 1936, who - according to a growing number of comics historians - was the true foreunner of the costumed superhero genre as we know it today. And that character was The Phantom, created and written by Lee Falk, and originally illustrated by Ray Moore.

The 2013 mayoralty race in Manila for now appears to be a two-corner affair between Lim and Estrada. Jojo Robles, columnist for Manila Standard, wrote that Estrada will only run if he is sure to defeat Lim. Otherwise, he will back Moreno instead. This is because Estrada cannot afford to close his long political career with two successive electoral defeats.

It has been about six months now since Star Wars: the Old Republic hit the internet, and it seems to be largely responsible for the huge employment cuts that Blizzard, the creators of World of Warcraft, have had to make. Gamers by the tens of thousand (or more) are moving over from World of Warcraft to The Old Republic, not because Warcraft isn’t any good, but because it has basically been the same for years and many gamers just need a change of scenery.

As we were walking in I saw a sign that said “Ear plugs 5 AED.” This was truly a sign as you will see if you play the videos with the sound all the way up. There was, however, no one in the ticket booths selling tickets or ear plugs. So, we just sauntered in and found a seat in the grandstand. There were only a few other people there as you will also notice in the videos. Racing hasn’t quite caught on here yet. The addage “if you build it, they will come” is taking a while to come to fruition. They built this big race track about three years ago and it’s only now that they are seeing enough racers to make it interesting. It hasn’t caught on as a spectator sport, yet. It hasn’t caught on with sponsors either, so the drivers are those who can afford to finance their own cars.

- Along the back wall, Kevin (the artist known as Kev) has an array of his own original prints and drawings for sale, whose subject matter ranges from classically-proportioned archangels in flight to current figures in world politics. Rendered mostly in colored pencil, and often in black and white with colors added for accent or background effect, the works were priced well below even the art found in Union Square, in an effort, Kevin said, "to make this available to people in the neighborhood, people who might actually walk in here." As to his work, Kevin added "I've been doing this since I was 4 years old . . . I try to incorporate as much as I can into this, politics, religion, whatever it is, to have something for everyone."

It is important to sprinkle the DE in any areas where insects may be, as the product must come in contact with the insects in order for it to be effective.

I think beer commercials are pointless. Beer is so good, and people want it soooo bad, that they can pretty much put what ever they want out there to make people want their product more, that can say pretty much whatever they want. Doesn't matter, cause people will keep buying it. No gimmick needed. The gimmicks they do have are so shitty anyways, its like, really? Whats the point!
I will end this post with a comment I overheard from a 10 year old girl (sounds like a future feminist no doubt):
My personal favorite scene was the big shoot out. About one hour in and it was tons of fun. EVERYONE is shooting their automatic weapons and EVERYONE is running through the middle of the raining bullets and I think only a few people were hit. I was hoping to hear some circus music. This happens in most movies with shoot outs so you have to embrace it and enjoy it and laugh.

It was amazing to hear the adorable sounds of a nursing baby deer which I'd heard with Petunia when I was bottle feeding her. I forgot just how sweet that sound is. Yes, it is the simple sound of a baby fawn nursing that makes my whole day.

I’m struggling with what to write today. I’m posting so late because I originally wrote an entire piece about the Octomom. I have it saved here on my computer, but I’m not sure if I should post it yet. That’s because the Octomom saddens me and it’s very easy to lose the funny when talking about a neglectful, self involved, idiot. So, I have the Octomom piece sitting here on my desktop and all I can think is, “I Wish I Had a Photoblog”. It feels like a photoblog would be so much easier right now. I know, I know, people with photoblogs don’t think a photoblog is easy at all. I mean you have to have the right equipment and lighting and a good eye, etc. Etc. However, right now, I simply want to post an image like this:

I try so hard to believe that God will give me the baby I am meant to have and to blindly accept that He knows best. I try so hard to believe the geneticist who told us that the odds of having another child with Down syndrome are slim. I try so hard to believe that no matter what I will look at my little girl and see perfection.

The office I work in delivers both therapy and medical care for the Trans population. The woman I work with is an amazing therapist and doctor, everyone that meets her feels better afterwards. I take care of everything other than the therapy and medical care. I take all the first calls and questions, the intakes and emails. I speak with surgeons, doctors and therapists often. I bolster parents and talk down teens. Doesn’t that sound altruistic and kind?
Sometimes I read a post and want to comment but I have so much to say that a comment just won’t do so I have to comment in one of my posts. Today is one of those times. There is a post that was Freshly Pressed in which a young woman is undertaking a 30 day challenge to eat “clean.” This means she is going to give up grains, gluten, dairy, sugar, alcohol, and legumes and she urges her readers to join her in this challenge.

True Story:
I'm laying 'forgetting the time' to rest.
I thought Gaby’s confession to Claudia and the revelation of Marisa’s secret was handled very tactfully and gracefully. Now that Claudia knows the truth, I don’t think she’ll be bothering the ladies anymore. Unfortunately, that was the only part of this episode I liked. I hated Bree’s storyline – that’s just not her character and I actually miss prim and proper Bree. I’m also tired of Lynette’s portrayal as the harping, nagging woman. I think she’s too smart to be so dense as to not realize what she’s doing to the men in her life. I love yoga, but I’m not sure it can be a cure all for her control issues. Here’s hoping! What do you think? Leave me your two cents!
I tried a new variant on my walk yesterday. Instead of turning around at the bridge that goes over the TGV tracks, I went over and then down on the opposite side and followed the tracks to the north. I was hoping to get a photo of the train going by, but after waiting awhile, my dog got impatient for the walk to continue. We eventually came to a small pass under the tracks that led to a small group of country homes that must have once belonged to landowners that got expropriated when the fast train tracks were built. The train goes right by a couple of the houses. Maybe the people living there have gotten used to the WOOSH every 30 minutes or so. But mostly, the land around the TGV tracks is farm land.
I’m sorry. I know that was hard to see. Nobody, least of all the parents of these infant delinquents, wants to admit something so heinous is possible. But it is. And VBB gangs like this are developing rapidly all over the globe.

There is plenty more to do on this island, including visiting a Baptist church in the settlement of La Loma on the top of the island, built in Alabama and contructed on the island.

If I tried to trace every part of Bitterblue to its root, this post would get rawther long, and anyway, for the most part, I would fail. When an idea comes to you while you're writing, you don't stop and say to yourself, "Ah! And where did that idea come from? I must make a note of it for future posterity!" ^_^ In other words, I have no memory of where most of my ideas for the book came from, if I ever knew. But I will leave you with one more tidbit. I wouldn't say that this song inspired Bitterblue, because I didn't particularly notice the song until I was already deep into my writing. But when I was far along in the book and needed a break, but not a complete break -- a break that still kept me tethered to the book -- I would go for a walk, sit by the river, and listen to "Cold As It Gets" by the divine Patty Griffin (link takes you to youtube and plays the song). Listen to it, if you like. If you love it, buy it :).
I haven’t really planned much by way of Easter, except dressing up my spring wreath. Mostly because either my mom or aunt usually host Easter. Last year it was my mom’s (and dad’s) turn.
A relative newcomer to the world of popular American chocolates, the Chunky was born in the 1930s. Created by Philip Silvershein in New York, the bar was marketed through Wrigleys (the gum company) and eventually snapped up by Nestle in 1984. Chunky was my personal favorite candy bar for many years and I still crave it now and then. The thick volume of chocolate is part of the attraction; it's heavy, it's powerful, it's serious indulgence. You know you're biting deep into something delicious rather than nibbling a little cracker-thin slip of chocolate. This milk chocolate trapezoid has a syrupy scent, reminiscent of dark rum. The star feature is the chocolate: dense, sweet, and easily gnawed into shards that melt in your mouth. Studded throughout are fat raisins, less tart than the Raisinet fruits, and smooth chunks of peanuts. The original bar featured Brazil nuts and cashews; wish I could have tasted it then! The raisins and peanuts still provide enough foil to keep a mouthful of chocolate from being texturally overwhelming while still making the Chunky bar a rich experience to savor. They may be out of fashion in our ever-downsizing world, but I love Chunky bars and I always will. There, I said it.

So, it becomes understandable when ethnicity discrimination is far less a public given when we can all drink from the same water fountains, attend the same schools and sit at the same lunch counters – that the changes wrought by the 50′s fusion of country and blues into rock n roll – are just part of the background social hum.

If these iniquitous practices find their place in our hearts and we are guilty, then when we arrive on the other side — and discover that we have deprived ourselves of eternal blessings and are accused by those who were assigned to come to us, because, as President Young has said, they were forced to take bodies in the families of the wicked — how will we feel? Moreover, may we not lose our own salvation if we violate this divine law?
My mom has been getting some cataracts taken care of, so my brother and I have been taking her to surgery and follow-ups, and helping her do her shopping and errands since she is presently unable to drive, and also has a bit of trouble getting around at times.

But the thing that I was most thankful for were all the sights that my camera had found, while out walking. Geese, as they sat on the dock, little waves rocking them to and fro... and white birds in flight, set against a background of warm brown sand. The vast array of colors that teased my senses... the bright light as it shown through the vibrant red, orange, green, and yellow leaves... the shadows as they swayed and danced across the forrest floor... the wind, as it blew tiny puffs of seeded fluff balls through the air, and the way the sun made each tiny puff ball glow... and the sounds of yelping foxes, when the evening had come. Most importantly, the love and warmth of family gathered 'round.

It was only a short walk but none the less enjoyable. On our way home, we stopped so that I could vote in our local elections (Mrs Tootlepedal had voted in the morning). I only hope that the new council can make a better job of maintaining our roads.

Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples; And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God! And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou? He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.

Bottom line: for me it isn’t just about the beer when I visit Old World Brewery.

When a company changes its fiscal year, it will often have a "short plan year" -- say, from July 1 to December 1 if they want to change their tax filing from June 30 to December 31. This comes up with a company's 401(k) plan, too -- same idea. The IRS prohibits what I'd like to see -- a "long plan year". You can't go 18 months with only 1 return to the IRS, apparently.
The original recipes called for more sugar but I really tend to like desserts having lesser sugars/butter content etc. So I modified them to suit my palette.

I’m trying to just write about this and let the thoughts pass through me and not do anything with them. The last thing I need to be doing right now is cutting. The manager of the rehabilitation program told me that this kind of behaviour is not accepted in the program. To be honest, I’m still finding myself triggered from the other day when I was at work in the sewing room. One of the girls in there started to cut herself with this special circular blade used to cut fabric. It was very minor, but she was still bleeding and if only she knew how much it’s triggered me. She was squeezing her skin and quite a bit of blood was coming out. Sorry for the details. It’s all just going through my mind.
An important factor is the break from traditional form. Tradition is renewed but slightly altered by additions like steps through time which is how change is normally effected, not by grand schemes that break the tradition like contemporary architecture and do not fit into their surroundings. This adds to the deculturation of local people who cease to feel they belong. Architecture needs to grow from tradition which helps anchor people in their community.

Roshon Fagan tried to pretend that he hasnt JUST hit puberty with a ‘sexy’ dance to Smokey Robinsons Cruisin’. The judges hit the nail on the head – his movement are far to ‘herky jerky’, like he’s trying to pop hip hop moves into a foxtrot… and it comes across as jarring and overdanced.

When we talk about means and ends. Our means are simply our actions. They are the strategically selected thoughts, words, actions, and habits that we carry out in our pursuit of some ends. The means that we choose will create the ends which are their natural, logical, and karmic conclusion.

I haven’t been keeping in touch with my friends, and I am really sorry for that. I haven’t been the best type of friend and I really do wish to make up for the lost time, if possible. I mean, I have a plan wherein I could send a gazillion messages to each of them for free (since we have the same network) but I haven’t done anything. I really have to step up and make them feel that I’m not taking them for granted.

There's no going back. There's only figuring out what comes next. How we do this, how we go on without him. Who we are now, as individuals and as a family.
Then, the other one might try to either explain what happened from their perspective, or in many cases, if they know that there really is not an explanation, they learn to say something along the lines of "I am sorry that I hurt your feelings. I wish that next time we play, that I'll remember to not do that to you." They usually give each other a hug when they are finished and then, they get up and move forward with the rest of their day.

There is so much to glean from in this one verse. I want to break it down one sentence at a time, because in this verse the Bride begins by speaking to her Beloved, then to the daughters of Jerusalem, and then back to her Beloved.
What happens when you put a picture like that on your profile photo? And I’m only considering situations where you’d be seeing quite a decent lad, cause the shitty ones, would just start ignoring you straight away and would pretend they don’t know you next time you’d meet them in town.
You want to know the sad thing? If I actually knew a fucking thing about any of these topics, I could create even more absurdly esoteric academic titles.

ATOMICS FOR THE MILLIONS was the first-ever book illustrated by Maurice Sendak. He was only nineteen when it was published and it would be another four years before he illustrated his first children's book, THE WONDERFUL FARM by Marcel Aymé. Since that time, of course, Maurice Sendak (WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE; IN THE NIGHT KITCHEN) has become one of the premiere children's book creators of our time.

Friday was Friday Night Sew In and I managed to get the following done.
Grandma and Grandpa sold their land to a grocery store in the 1990s, and they spent their last ten years or so in a neat little ranch in the suburbs. It was a nice place for them to be, but I never felt it suited them. When Grandpa died (of a heart attack, right there in the house), Grandma began to lose her hold on reality. The dementia had already started before Grandpa died, but it seemed his death accelerated it. She spent another year or two in that house, with my mom and my aunt taking care of her, swearing Grandpa and his friends were playing cards under the bed. When my mom and my aunt simply could not care for her anymore, she moved into a nursing home, where she died. I know it's not what my mom wanted. But what could she do? That time comes for everyone, eventually.

A mini ocean scene is what transpired! I love the seahorse cut on Create a Critter and am so excited I finally used it. Oh how I wish the sparkle showed in these pictures! I used Core Couture cardstock for the sand and seaweed, so they're super sparkly with their silver flecks. The shells are also made with sparkling paper. I embossed the sand to make it look a little more sandy. The sweet seahorse has an itty bitty rhinestone for her eye because she's twinkling with love. I used Glossy Accents for the bubbles and foam tape for the seahorse and seashells for dimension. I attached the little tag with Blueberry Blue Trendy Twine and added a tiny heart rhinestone. Everything is inked with Dew Drop Brilliance ink (Sky Blue) for extra shimmer.
Far right marches are happening in Europe more and more as of recently, and unlike in America, there are comparatively very few counter-protests. There is even a "anti-", "scapegoat" element to these movements- some have replaced anti-semitism with anti-bankerism, others have replaced the jews with the muslims. Yet others retain elements of anti-semitism. Some of these movements are founded simply on the fact that Europeans want to preserve their culture, and are fed up with culture-and population replacement.
An excellent look at The Elizabethans by A.N. Wilson ($30.00, Farrar, Straus and Giroux) is out this month. It is worth reading because this period in England’s history set in motion so much that followed. It was a time of exceptional creativity, wealth creation, and political expansion and was filled with colorful and dynamic characters, not the least of which was Elizabeth I. Sir Francis Drake not only defeated the Spanish Armada, but circumnavigated the world. Shakespeare wrote his plays in this period. Declaring its independence from the Church, England laid the foundations for the explosion of the British Empire. This extraordinary era is captured in a single volume that anyone interested in history will want to read and add to their personal library.

But lately, it seems like our progression has sped up somethin’ fierce, and a lot of people are being left behind! I like to think I’m decent enough at adapting to the ever-quickening pace of society, but even I feel like I’m starting to stumble and fall behind the times. So many changes around me simply baffle and confuse me. And make me feel like a fuckin’ old man.

I held you close to my heart,
At the Digital Parents Conference last week, I realised how far I was from the edge. What began, for me, as a radical act, is now me in a room of my own, feeling quite happy that I have a room of my own. While I’m ever grateful for having the support of my husband and family to write, I need to use this room for greater good. It seems too big for just one little bird.
This post is going to be short and sweet.
I tried to protect myself but a fresh crop of attackers – I guess between four and six – joined in. As they knocked me to the ground one of them brought a traffic cone repeatedly down on the back of my head.

Some brokers and clients are extremely worried about having no other potential buyer to turn to in the event the contracted-with buyer manages to slip away, so they keep quiet about the accepted offer, keep showing the property, and wait for the contingencies to expire. Get it?
I love the name of Jesus.
The same principle has other uses, though. Let’s say you’re faced with a status quo that is obviously problematic and headed for trouble, and you want to envision an alternative. Even among thoughtful people these days, it’s all too common to meet this sort of situation by imagining the opposite of the status quo as your alternative, and assuming that since the status quo is bad, the opposite must be good. There are some obvious problems with this sort of thinking, and some that may not be so obvious; we’ll be talking in another week or so about the way that binary opposition locks into place whatever it sets out to oppose, for example.
The growing momentum of the last 10 years has now laid the foundation to saturate nations in prayer. It’s time to shift our focus from 220 nations to facilitate a lifestyle of prayer with as many people in as many places as possible. In this new season, we will no longer aim at the goal of having organized events in every single country of the world, but rather to increase the number of gatherings on Pentecost Sunday in smaller settings, such as local churches, family homes and businesses instead of stadiums and assembly halls.

The novel also features the prominent return of one of my favorite moons in Nar Shaddaa. The Smuggler's Moon has been criminally underutilized in the modern EU. It is one of the seedier and more interesting locations. We also get a lot of other interesting Hutt locations. The exploration of addiction, servitude and corruption are ripe ground for more storytelling and serve as but a glimpse of what we could enjoy in the in development Star Wars: Underworld TV series.

In the couple months that followed he announced his signing with the University of Oregon and stated he would run Indoor Track where he would debut against the pro's at the New Balance meet in the mile. Meet #1 wound up with Lukas running a 4:03.88 for the full mile (4:02.5 for 1600) and finished ahead of Olympian Leo Manzano. This mark was good for #3 all time. A couple weeks later he lined up against Bernard Lagat at the Armory in NY as both were chasing records for the 2 mile. Lagat was chasing the US record and Lukas was clear he was chasing Gerry Lindgren's storied 2 mile record of 8:40.0. Lagat crushed the record with an 8:10.07 and Lukas managed to come home in 8:43.24 splitting 3200 at just under 8:40.
My cat. We had to put him down almost a week ago because he had an embolism and some kind of heart disease. That may seem like a very little thing, but I had that cat for eight years. He was family and he was my cat, which makes it all the worse.

To top it all, when I got to the hotel, they had messed up my reservation and didn’t have a room for me. It was now getting quite late. Searches on the internet and phone calls later, we found that all hotels in the area were fully booked. They did manage to find me a mobile home in a local camp site though. That was the final straw. I decided that I had bitten off more than I could chew and would forget about riding the rest of the Tour. Whether through stupidity or naivety, there was no way that I could do this every day for 3 weeks. In any case, I was missing my wife and kids.

This Valentine’s Day, it doesn’t matter if you have a boyfriend, girlfriend, husband or wife. It doesn’t matter if you’re newly single or if you’ve been single all your life. What matters is that you are a unique, important individual who loves and is loved. No matter where you are in life, take the day to let your love be known and to appreciate those who have shown care for you. Take just a brief moment to shine a little more love on the world through a few kinds words, a hug, or a smile, for our efforts go further than we will ever know.

Becky remained silent. She had already overstepped her boundaries more than once today and she would not put it past Lord Hastings to turn her out even at this late hour. Though a thousand retorts swirled in her head, she merely clamped her lips shut and walked to the shelves of books that lined the walls, drawing her robe tighter around her as she did.
Liev had a great time running around, picking parsnips and just being a little boy who was able to roam free and get dirty. He ate tomatoes right off the vine and mulberries right off the tree. The potluck was right during his nap time and he didn't even miss it. He did nap on the very short drive home and then on me on the couch. We thought he'd be cranky and we were prepared to leave early but he was so great. I guess he was having too much fun to think about sleeping.

Then I picked up my 6 beers from ABC and headed off to party numero dos. I had actually had a beer on Thursday and Friday, and was feeling strangely hungoverish (well, the way I feel after drinking anyway), so I ended up not drinking much. Oh, the beers I had the previous two nights were draft beers, one at The Uptown Bar and one at Lazy Moon. I can't remember what the beer at Uptown was because I couldn't really read it. At Lazy moon I had a Beamish Irish Stout (Irish Dry Stout, 4.1% ABV) on tap. Oh how I love Irish stouts. So creamy...mmm... This was creamy, smooth, and malty, and it felt so good going down my throat.

I don’t know why God has impressed upon me the truth of this issue, but I want to share something that noted author Dan Allender said in his book Wounded Heart. Satan hates male and female distinctions because they are made in God’s likeness. God uniquely created each person and had no confusion when He made each one of us. Satan cannot create anything except confusion, so he will twist God’s creation to the point of homogeny, and corrupt God’s beauty and design for all mankind.

Among the topics covered are: 1) the special presence of God in physical objects prior to the incarnation, 2) comparison of the indwelling and the Real Presence, 3) doubting disciples in the eucharistic discourse of John 6, 4) exclusion of non-Catholics from Catholic communion, 5) St. Augustine's and John Calvin's views, 6) the Church fathers on the Sacrifice of the Mass, 7) St. Paul's "priestly" references, 8) biblical, analogical arguments for the Sacrifice of the Mass, 9) the Protestant "idolatry" accusation, and 10) biblical evidence for wholehearted formal, liturgical worship.

Yes I do think this is worth a read. The landscape depicted is beautiful and most of the characters, very well rounded. There are elements within the story which let this book down in my opinion, but overall this is a very good read.
So God is the capacity or function of identifying something as an outcome and then it just basically happens by itself, like for you running is a function at which you are competent to create at the level of God. You just think of running and then it happens by itself.

7. Lord Boswell - Conservative - Has shares in Reckitt Benckiser which produces drugs for the NHS amongst other health institutions. NHS is currently suing Reckitt Benckiser for £90 million following an investigation that ruled the company had abused its dominant position in the heartburn market. The company has just paid a fine for £10.2 million in 2010 following a ruling by the Office of Fair Trading which found them guilty of illegal anti-compative behaviour relating to their heartburn product Gaviscon. Lord Boswell's shares have in brackets household part of the company, but in the end it is the same company. He also has shares in GlaxoSmithKline PLC pharmaceuticals.
With the invention of writing and the printing press, human cultures hitherto reliant on oral lore to transmit cultures, adapted writing as the dominant medium of communication. The ‘externalization of memory’ no doubt led to a profound shift in our thought and consciousness, but also made the art of memory quite redundant. In Plato’s Phaedrus, which is essentially a complex dialogue between Socrates and Phaedrus on what constitutes artful speaking and writing, Socrates argues that since writing has no notion of the receiver’s soul, it can neither raise questions nor offer instructions and can at best serve not as a recipe for memory, but a mere tool for reminding, and hence only implant forgetfulness. (Phaedrus was required reading while at graduate school, and while it may be an insightful analysis of communication and its breakdown, it is hands down the most dense and enigmatic conversation I’ve ever dissected.)

Later, I talked with Howard about my episode and he assured me that “Ayahuasca can do that!” The type of episode I experienced, where one loses awareness of one’s self as participating in a ceremony, is rare. It is, he promised, something that can turn out to have much deeper meaning later on. He said I was unlikely to encounter that kind of experience or vision again, but if I should do so, “You’ll know how to handle it.”

Mirror reading can tell us that when Paul talks about the weak and the strong later in the letter, he’s trying to unify factions within the church. But what kind of factions? And how deep do these divisions run? And how primary is it if he only devotes one or two chapters at the end of a 16-chapter letter? Mirror reading can’t tell us that, and the letter itself is too subtle to tell us outright. But analyzing the context of both Rome and the rhetoric Paul uses can tell us much more.

Having faith doesn’t mean I become a carbon copy of the person next to me in the pews. I am still myself, my own unique self. With my thoughts, my feelings, my opinions, my faith. My unique relationship with God. I’ve found that having faith is definitely not for the weak. Having faith to me means I have to woman up in ways I haven’t needed to before. I need to be honest in ways I never have before. It takes a strong person to have faith. By embracing faith, I have placed myself under a gigantic magnifying glass, where every single little flaw is visible. But standing there also means that my good qualities are enhanced as well.

Scientists had previously thought that a climate shift from warm and humid to seasonally cooler and drier had helped create those savannas, which covered even more of Central Africa in the past. But the 40,000-year-old record preserved in the sediment cores tells a different story. Roughly 3,500 years ago the Congo River suddenly began dumping a lot more muck without any appreciable increase in rainfall to explain such weathering. One plausible explanation is the simultaneous arrival of the so-called Bantu people, who brought farming into the region.

The other big thing that happened was we (my wife and I of course, even though she is currently in Japan) bought a new car. Yes, a new car. I really didn’t want to go that route while just settling down, but I did some shopping around and the used car market SUCKS. Most cars I was interested in were either high miles, bad condition, salvage titles, dirty, or a combination of all. To top it off, they were still around $13,000 to start! So I talked to my wife and said we have two choices: we can buy a lower end new car that will be covered over the coming years with a warranty. The other choice was to go super cheap, $5,000 or under, and just pray that the car lasts as long as it can. We decided to spring for the new car and not worry about anything for a while. Here’s the ride:

Nowadays, tourism is the lifeblood of the town, which provides a base for hikers and climbers, and it is usually very busy during the summer season. There are plenty of hotels, guest houses and restaurants, as well as 10 pubs or bars within a quarter-mile radius. In addition to the inevitable souvenir shops, there are also a number of shops dealing in specialist arts and crafts, and stores selling clothing and equipment for outdoor pursuits.
The real life carriage pram was second hand it was in perfect condition, taking Shane for a walk on our dirt roads was anything but peaceful, the poor little might was bumped around so much I had to only walk in the garden....but seeing it parked on the verandah with a little hand waving about under the net was so beautiful.
I'm really REALLY excited about it. Although it's been hectic managing my current work load while trying to set up shop for going forward. But if all goes well the potential is there for me to work half days and earn double what I'm earning now while doing what I enjoy and working for causes that matter AND working from home with baba nearby.

Speaking of resolutions, I can't begin to tell you how important it is to learn and follow the GREENER life style. Yes, I teach that, but I also believe in it. A healthier lifestyle is not only exercise and better eating habits, but it is an awareness to your environment, by learning what harm ordinary household items such as cleaning supplies can impact your health. I don't buy harsh cleaning items anymore....the alternatives are not expensive, but in fact can save you money, not to mention your health and that of your child. Well if you really want to think of it, you are impacting many generations to come!

It’s been a tough day for us emotionally. Yesterday it was so reassuring to see how well she was doing… easy to imagine that she was just another perfectly healthy infant with a normal life expectancy. Our meeting with the hospital’s pediatrician this morning quickly brought us back down to reality. It shatters my soul to imagine EVER having to say goodbye to such a sweet little being; my tiniest little daughter.
My response: I don't agree. These words, sincerely meant, are perfectly valid and appreciated by me, regardless of my personal views on religion or particular religions. I find this being referred to as a "tired cliché" quite offensive to the sincere views of the well-wisher.
My life also changed I became a mother, my boys grew up with his music, they thought it was fantastic to hear someone sing in the language they spoke.
But. Even for an extreme case like that of the Jongs, it seems that some similarities are downright inescapable. The essay leaves the reader with the impression that mother and daughter are two sides of the same coin: hilarious, outspoken, confident–just with different views on stuff. (And whether those similarities are due to nature or nurture, does it really matter?) And sometimes, even the stuff falls into line: That friend of mine spent last Thanksgiving at a silent retreat, subsisting on raw juices and enjoying morning colonics.

The national park has always been a haunt for tourists, wild life lovers and adventure enthusiast. The number of people visiting the place has increased surprisingly over the past few years, mostly in between November to June. The increase in the footfall is also leading to many problems like ecological imbalance, tiger pouching and hunting, etc. With the use of high definition, software based cameras which will be mounted on towers and placed all across the park; the massive threat from the poachers can be controlled.

I’ve been busy on the mental health front and thought a little update may be of interest – I’m going to start a regular ‘update’ blog instead of blogging on specific subjects all the time. Frankly, I’m running out of topics that I haven’t already covered but want to keep covering a bit of what I’m up to and a bit of stuff in the news. There may well be specific posts too, as news or events dictate or if I or you come up with some fresh ideas!!

with two full-page editorials. The first, in November and December 1948 cover-dated issues, addressed their concern with the media’s criticism of comic books and countered that they obtained editorial advice from Dr. Jean Thompson, a psychiatrist in the Child Guidance Bureau of the New York City Board of Education, and likely someone that Dr. Wertham considered part of the problem as a comic book apologist. Dr. Thompson’s name was placed at the bottom of page one in bold black letters, signaling that Marvel Comics were “above criticism,” which interestingly revealed that internally, the company was calling itself “Marvel Comics” at this time, not Timely Comics.
Nearly a year ago, I got the itch to start a new challenge.
If any other director asked an actor to put down a teacup, it would be only that. But with Hitch it was done for a reason. If an actor was strumming his fingers it wasn't just an idle strumming, it had a beat, a musical pattern to it--it was like a sound refrain.
We headed to one of the two most haunted sites in Old Town and this one supposedly was the site of an actual portal. I guess when Lori first thought to do these tours she learned that mediums and other psychic-ish people had already researched some locations in town and imagine her surprise that little old Fort Collins had its very own portal. We went to the Walrus ice cream shop. This is a shop next door to Rio restaurant, one of the only decent Mexican food restaurants in Northern Colorado. Mat and I have been to Rio countless times but never to the Walrus. There is a door (that remains locked) in the back of the ice cream shop. Lori got the key from the teenager working the cash register and we went downstairs. We were then told that Fort Collins has a series of underground tunnels running throughout. That door way in Walrus leads to some of those tunnels. She had armed each of us with a flashlight and she had given me and another weirdo an EMF (electromagenetic field) meter. A couple of others had EVP (electronic voice phenomenon) meters and we also had a temperature gun thing to check for cold spots.

The image of the Mohave green rattler looked like the sort of snapshot any amateur could take. And the photos from the top of the hill? Uninspired. Her subterfuge with the memory card that morning had been unnecessary after all. Even worse, offering the card to the sheriff had been a mistake, the act of someone with a guilty conscience. Would the sheriff believe her guile came from such a flimsy motive as wanting to safeguard her photos? Who knew what the sheriff thought. He’d kept his own counsel, and his eyes, even when he’d set aside his mirrored sunglasses during lunch, hadn’t given her a clue.

This is just a quick blog post from the couch to say that I am only too aware of how absent I have been. Since I last wrote, the Festival that I came over here to coordinate has happened. I had a Fellow reunion at the Kennedy Center. I birthed a new project for 2013. I saw The Ting Tings live in concert. The Discovery Shuttle was flown to DC on the back of a 747. And all of these things deserve individual attention. Yet as I sit here with House playing out on the telly, I don’t have the oomph to take it all on just yet. But I will. I have decided that I need to write more frequently, less for you guys – the millions of people who actually read this – and more for myself. As the diary-come-event-capture-come-tink-think it was designed to be. So sit tight. I’m on it. Just not at the moment!

Every once in a while games come along that appeal to the masses, and thank goodness. Because frankly, priesthoods are a perversion of what games are about as well. The worst possible fate for games (and, by extension, our species) would be for games to become niche, something played by only a few elite who have the training to do so. It was bad for sports, it was bad for music, it was bad for writing, and it would be bad for games, as well.
....and because I know moms love this kind of thing, I added a popular and meaningful scripture, which in English says, "I will go and do what the Lord has commanded." I thought I was original, but then the 16-year-old girl reminded me that my photographer friend Shauna had used this scripture on a photo of her son. She said I was copying. It all came back to me then, that yes, indeed, this is where the original inspiration had come from. Hope you don't mind me copying you, Shauna! It's the highest form of flattery!

Such a change in mentality, however, would have happened much more among the earlier generations than among the later ones. Yet this is not what we see in the data. AFR changed at the same rate from one generation to the next throughout the 140-year period. Couples married after 1870 showed the same rate of change as couples married before 1870. Indeed, this steady rate of change seems to rule out most socio-cultural explanations, particularly those that involve some kind of re-adjustment to new conditions. In any case, the study period (1800 to 1940) postdates the years of immigration and settlement (1720 to 1773).

I really wanted to have Vertigo on this list, mostly because it’s my single favorite Hitchcock film. Jimmy Stewart gives simply an awesome performance as the troubled and almost creepy-obsessive main character. And the plot, with its hints at ghosts, dopplegangers and an all around unhappy ending really had me struggling to overcome what I knew was true. Vertigo is a sublime example of a richly textured psychological thriller, not a horror film. It pained me to do so, but Vertigo is out.
I was also happy with the results of processing, chilling, and waiting. ( it gets better the longer it stays in the refrigerator up to about a week)

We are, indeed, diminished by our loss. But the words I want to conclude with are those of the first respondent on the Telegraph article reporting Breitbart’s death;
This time it’s different. I am merely an observer. Everyone sees the sorrow – how could we not, when it’s our own world which has suddenly been cracked open - and we’re talking openly about it. The digital stratosphere is full of messages of love, of relief, of people telling the world they’re ok, to only worry about those less fortunate. Everyone tells everyone else to hug loved ones. But soon the messages of loss will start coming through. There’s a sense that we’re standing on the edge of a black hole that has opened up. And true to being Kiwi, we feel slightly guilty that we’re ok while someone else is suffering.

He shimmered out, and I sat up in bed with that rather unpleasant feeling you get sometimes that you’re going to die in about five minutes.

Ever since 2006, the Illegal Immigration Relief Act has been locked up in various courts -- people have argued back and forth about the conditionality of the laws -- and it has been the topic on about a million talk shows.

The Supreme Court has weighed in. Positions have been staked. Both sides seem entrenched.

Euphoric, of course, then the let down: it was great but not the meaning of life.

There are many Christians who want/claim to be in communion with Christ, but who are unwilling to let go of their worldly lusts and things that are contrary to Christ, that are part of this world. Are you like one of them? Am I like one of them? Think of the things that you partake of — the things that you are part of and more importantly the things that are part of you. Once you have that list, prayerfully commit those to the Lord Jesus Christ, seeking his strength to have communion with none other than Jesus Christ and remember, a Christian cannot partake of God and of the devil.

Perhaps it’s no big deal. We’re certainly being provided with a lot of stuff, a lot of visual bells and whistles to keep us occupied. Perhaps, in the end, it is enough to be entertained, and not worry about what any of it actually means. If that is the case, then all we can do is trust that those deciding what we will see, how often and how much, will take good care of us; because we won’t have enough information to take care of ourselves.

Another issue that usually rises in such gestures is the equilibrium between the two poles:(youth-maturity) and (iron – wood), like the synthesis of Picasso.

The iron surface extends all the way to the mezzanine, where the contact lenses are nested.
I by no means claim that all home schooling is bad. Unfortunately, the sole reason many parents choose home schooling is to prevent their children from being contaminated by learning to think, by denying science that might run counter to their own semi-literate dogma. Science is always open to further improvement; dogma cannot change, ever. When children taught by dogma enter the work force, they will compete against people from all over the world who are not so stunted. They will come out behind, and so will we.
