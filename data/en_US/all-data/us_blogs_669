The following may seem a digression but please follow. Any book on telling you how to sell and market your work, will tell you that even after you have a contract with a publisher, you will need to do a lot of your own self PR, unless you are a major league author, and even then - you still have to do it.

First order of business…I signed the lease on a town home last Thursday! We move in the first weekend in June (hopefully). They are replacing the carpets in the town home and I want to wait until that is done before I start moving all of my things over there. Until then, I have been cleaning up my dorm and packing up my car to move home for the next month or so until I can make the town home officially mine. We’ll have six girls living together, two to a room. I am so excited to get moved over there…I just want to do it all right now.

Strawberries are my absolute favorite fruit. Unfortunately, you can’t get great fresh strawberries year round. Now that strawberries are in season, I made sure to pick some up at the grocery store so I could make a dessert highlighting them. I wasn’t sure what though, so I pulled a few books off the shelf, including Cook’s Country 2006 annual, and found these brown sugar berry shortcakes. I just loved the idea of using brown sugar to sweeten the berries, the shortcakes and the whipped cream. While these shortcakes may look difficult to make, the dough comes together rather quickly in the food processor. Some of the berries are crushed and sweetened to make a sauce for the berries and then you make sweetened whipped cream. A few steps maybe, but all of them actually quick and easy.
Unfortunately, one of the challenges of nonfiction is to be as compelling in truth as fiction is in …fiction. It’s this hurdle that Jacobs, for me at least (after all, from 280 reviews on Amazon, The Know-It-All does have four out of five stars) doesn’t quite overcome. The book increased my appreciation for knowledge, which I suppose is in part what Jacobs hoped to accomplish, but it didn’t increase my appreciation for A.J. Jacobs, which is probably something an author of several books wants to hear. But hey, I’ve always been a big fan of Esquire.
Now, let’s start with the first updates: Class revamps. Warrior, Magician, Bowman and the Knights of Cygnus have been revamped. Well, just a few skill changes have been made, but at least it’s something :). These changes are to make the power of these classes equal to the Legends classes. They were overpowered.

NTC leaders are adamant he was shot in the head when he was caught "in crossfire" between his supporters and new regime fighters soon after his capture.
Echo is a heart stopper, and a crowd experience, as people helplessly gravitate in her direction. Monumental at 40' high, the sculpture fools your eye. While she looks like a flat, photographic image--she is not. Beautiful Echo is so grand, she invites conversation among strangers, while she dwells within herself. This is the most gorgeous sculpture I've ever seen and is right outside Eataly, the largest artisanal Italian food and wine marketplace in the world. This fantastic gourmet emporium is the collaboration and dream of visionary foodies: Oscar Farinetti, Mario Batali, Lidia Bastianich, and her son Joe. Oh dear God!! If you don't go, don't tell me.
Happy Birthday my darling!!!
Next week will be our Fall Open House. My teammate and I were thinking of a fun way to have the students share the second grade experiences so far this year.

Contemporary? Check. Road trip? Check. Swoon worthy male with a potential romance? Check. This book has had me giddy with excitement ever since I first heard about it. Also the reviews so far have been quite positive. However this book will have to wait until I get through my galleys, but just knowing it’s there sitting on my kindle waiting for me leaves me with warm fuzzies.

I'm not really sure what to make of this situation. On the one hand, I'm so happy to finally be heard. I knew something was wrong and I've been telling them for a long time now. On the other, I'm scared I will regain the weight I've worked so hard to lose. I know I can maintain and even lose when I can actually eat healthy foods without pain or discomfort. That's what I'm banking on right now.
The last two weeks were wonderful but crazy. I'm sure I'm not alone in this. I sat down for a bit this morning as I pondered...things. I couldn't decide if I wanted to reflect on the Christmas season or set goals for the new year. So, I did neither. Yet.

There are moments in Jasmine Skies when Mira realizes how small and insignificant she is in the vast universe. Mythology is a way that humans have always attempted to make sense of our world. Many myths are born from the human search to understand the wonders of nature, in all its power, frightening force and unpredictability. For me, the epic scale of nature’s wonders is celebrated in Airavata – the beautiful celestial elephant of the clouds who is, as my daughter said, ‘bigger than you, me and everyone.’
Outside of the accusation, there is no evidence that any of these kids worked for the U.S. government, let alone the CIA. For starters, they all attended University of California at Berkley, not exactly a hot bed to recruit spies for the U. S. government. Although not exactly a prime destination spot for American tourists, the simple fact of these kids going into this region does not make them spies. Foolish, yes; spies, no.
We hopped on the quad and decided to park the quad close and leave it running just in case we get attacked!

This week we learned that a thirty-something Colombian leader has been named to lead Mennonite World Conference and that the office is moving from Strasbourg, France to Bogotá, Colombia. For much of church history the Jesus story was told through the lens of power–through a European lens. This handoff of leadership to the global South seems to be aligned with the narrative arc of the Emmaus story.
Vackie and Edward eventually apologized days later. I accepted their explanations and told them it's okay. But I realized, just because you understand, it doesn't mean you don't feel bad pala. I haven't heard from Arlan.
So while you all vie to be the king of stupidity, whilst each and all groups battle an enemy created, here at AAWR we shout our warning, state truth as we see it knowing full well that few hear us. If one could manage both sides of the problem, a problem created by a reprehensible foreign policy, a rogue regime and a puppeteered government, then one could simply use whichever side was most likely to stir the body-politic, stir the public consciousness in the direction one desired, a direction wholly at odds with the peoples betterment.
Place the ball of pastry on a lightly floured work surface and flatten slightly with the palm of your hand. Press the rolling pin into the top edge of the pastry and roll out an "arm". Give the dough a quarter turn and roll out another "arm". Continue to turn and roll twice more until the pastry is in the shape of a cross. It should be mounded in the centre, tapering out the 4 arms.
Of course this is just one night’s tasting. Purely in the interests of brewing science, I will continue to sample on your behalf.

Joh 12:48-50, I came to save the world. But you need to know that whoever puts me off, refusing to take in what I’m saying, is willfully choosing rejection. The Word, the Word-made-flesh that I have spoken and that I am, that Word and no other is the last word. I’m not making any of this up on my own. The Father who sent me gave me orders, told me what to say and how to say it. And I know exactly what his command produces: real and eternal life. That’s all I have to say. What the Father told me, I tell you.”
One thing that I’ve learned from them is that a little reminder of home goes along way. For instance going into the city and finding a store with familiar foods can bring comfort.

Grief over the death of her first-born son Thomas in 1817, turned Lucretia Mott’s thoughts increasingly to religion. In 1818 she made her first “appearance in the ministry” in Quaker meeting, & 3 years later she was officially recorded as a minister. It was an easy transition from the ministers’ gallery of a Friends’ meetinghouse to the public platform, from which she was presently speaking with a self-assurance, facility, & eloquence almost unknown among women in that day.

To attain that satisfaction in your relationships – ANY relationship – we are each responsible for educating those with whom we are interacting of what we desire in the relationship to find that fulfillment. In other words, we have to train them. Some people get offended at the mention of being trained. I, for one, happen to like the idea of being trained. Maybe it’s because of my military background. Or perhaps it’s because of my seemingly insatiable thirst for knowledge. Whatever the case, I enjoy being educated, especially when it comes to the woman I love.

If you were reading our blog about 2 years ago when we first got to Indonesia, I did a short series of posts that I called RIOs – Random Indonesian Objects. Now that we’ve been here a while longer it seems like there’s many more items I could add to the list, so we’ll start with this one:
Finealta is Scotch Gaelic for “elegant.” Essentially, a recipe dating back to around 1903 was discovered in the archives at Glenmorangie, one that mixed certain percentages of various ages from various casks, finally producing a perfectly elegant mixture. Finealta is an attempt at recreating this recipe.
Through all the iterations of Mommy madness, 'good' and 'bad,' this article of faith always remains intact: that parents can have control.That is what it's all about: you can (must) control your child's behavior, his environment, his activities. Follow these simple rules, and you can't lose. Almost every parenting philosophy promises results in the form of what kind of person you can make your child into. And each philosophy also demonizes the alternatives and warns of the bad results that are guaranteed if you dare parent your kids any other way.
One such DeLillo hallmark on display is that sense of inexorability and dread hanging over every page. The plot to kill Kennedy may have started with a handful of disgruntled agents choosing to go off the reservation, but by November 22, 1963, the event seems almost preordained. And in DeLillo’s version of Oswald, a treatment so sympathetic it led George Will to call it “an act of bad citizenship,” you have a terrifically complex character, someone who believed he existed to shape history, but in truth, was someone shaped entirely BY history. Consider how after the assassination, Lee Oswald instantly and irreversibly becomes Lee Harvey Oswald, a name change so jarring that his mother no longer recognizes him as her son, but as a media creation forced into action by outside, alien forces.

Last Wednesday, while walking to college, I bumped into a couple of reporters from a national TV station; they insisted on a short interview about the national day. “get feedback from the youth, and things like that, you know?” so I stopped for a while, even though I was sort of rushing to meet Als and the bunch. And I felt bad, because these people were obviously just doing their job … and I’m a communications student after all.
In addition to the California cases, Apple and Samsung are waging more than 20 legal fights in at least 10 countries in their war for global leadership of smartphone and tablet markets.
I take my outfit photos with a simple point and shoot camera that has a single frame self-timer. For every single shot I have to frame it with an imaginary person, activate the timer, jump into the shot, pose, and wait. Then I go back and do it again. I have thought often about upgrading to a nicer camera, but J and I have decided that we want to invest in a really high quality DSLR since he loves to take photos at the racetrack. Unfortunately, that's not in our budget right now.

Something for us to ponder. It’s been running through my mind lately, and I thought I’d share it.
I love that in the second part of the interview, Bolick talks a little bit more about what she would have added to the piece, which she wrote in a little over a week after six weeks of research. She also goes on to say that one of the critiques of her work was that she didn’t say anything new, but the truth is that she elevated a conversation that needed to be addressed in a different way. She talks about the need for “relationship ed” or ways to educate our ourselves about how to navigate these new social changes that are underway, which sounds like a fabulous idea. And then she says something that I could completely relate to, when she talked about wanting to marry someone who shares her values:
"You will remember that during the World War in 1917 or thereabouts many attempts were made by the government, and by private parties, too, to make a cover on the lower side of airplane wings with such a perfect surface that they could obtain a perfect reflection. That is to say, no lines or shadows showing, there could be no distinction made by the eye between the plane or wing and the surrounding objects or sky."
I was going to say walkman there, but I think I got away with it.

I'd last seen this reach in January. It's still changing. Much of the sand that used to be in the upstream section now sits here in bars, under big granite boulders. Because it runs so heavily, so much of the time, it flushes the old mill sediments from upstream (don't worry, they end up behind other dams downstream).

I'm trying to get creative here to keep her occupied. I'm not a huge fan of letting her watch a lot of TV. We usually watch Blues Clue, Word World or Backyardigans before she goes to bed while she eats a snack, but I've bent the rules a little. She's not used to constant silence every day, so I've had the TV on or playing her CD's most of the day. She usually watches 5 minutes of a show and then moves on, but I think she likes the noise.

There is no doubt about:
By basing his story in Varanasi, Chetan has shown the willingness to go beyond the metros he has generally portrayed in his story and probably strike a cord with the semi urban populace. His descriptions of each and every ghat are fantastic which goes to show the amount of research he has put in for the same. Another interesting fact different from his earlier books is that the main protagonist is shown (at least in the first half) as someone who isn’t rich but generally has to save money to make do with things in his life.
I was disappointed by the low overall rating on IMDb so I decided to write a review. Perhaps the other voters didn’t see the same movie that I did. This is hands down the best romantic comedy I’ve seen in recent years (emphasis on comedy), with original and unexpected quips. In my humble opinion, this movie should at least have a 7 out of 10. And let me add that I am Asian. Two days before watching this movie I tried watching The Science of Sleep – a movie that was annoying pretentious and frankly disappointing coming from the director of the fabulous Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. That movie is rated a whopping 7.3 on IMDb which I think – pardon my French – is total crap. There is no way that Think Like a Man should be rated lower than this movie, thus Think Like a Man must truly have a higher rating than 7.3!
We got the house officially on the market Tuesday night/Wednesday morning. Our realtor said that it takes a week for all the websites to load up the pictures and the info about our house so we hope to start getting calls about showings then. Hopefully.

In the first level of Donkey Kong, the title ape does not use any sort of jungle weaponry to face Mario. Rather, they face off in some sort of factory, with DK hurling barrels at Mario as he seeks to reach the top of the level. This stage suggests that the black man has become dangerous living within white society; that he can use white folks’ own tools as weapons against the status quo. While Donkey Kong throws tools at Mario, the carpenter has his own weapons to rely upon. The hammers hanging in the level make obvious tools of attack, and yet Mario, following the pacifistic ways of Christ, uses them as tools. Rather than attack his kidnapper, he smashes the oncoming barrels with the sledges. The first level of the video reinforces the old and very racist stereotypes that the white man is smarter than the inherently violent and foolhardy black man.

Wait… nevermind. Blah, blah, additional episode about a character I don’t care about made even less interesting by fleshing out a plot point I’m tired of. They’re so heavily suggesting that Artemis is the mole that there’s no way it would end up being her. And in the case that it was, we’re already told that she is, which just makes for bad story-telling.

But even aside from violating the Constitution, it makes no economic sense for us to be engaged in yet another war overseas — especially during such tough economic times. For years now, we’ve been sending foreign aid to the very same Libyan government we’re now spending $10 million a day to fight. And it has been recently discovered that the Federal Reserve’s bank bailouts even benefited the Libyan National Bank. Now, we’re taxing the American people to bomb the very nation that we taxed them to prop up.

I have no illusions about what last night’s speech was. It was a campaign speech, full of plans and promises that don’t have a sick wife’s chance with Newt Gingrich of ever being passed into law. This is dispiriting, but, considering that Congress has managed to achieve an approval rating that’s barely hovering in single-digits, and considering that it’s an election year and not much would’ve gotten done even if the current Congress wasn’t full of ignorant vandals and politically recalcitrant cementheads, that was completely to be expected. And the plans and promises were surprisingly bold, considering the source. Some of the president’s base is not going to be happy with a lot of the speech; I’m not overjoyed with the saber-rattling over Iran, or the notion that the American political system is basically supposed to be Seal Team 6. (Eric Cantor is supposed to have the president’s back? The president’s supposed to have his? What planet are we on here?) But there are unmistakable signs in the speech that the president’s re-election campaign is going to place the consequences of a rigged economy squarely in the middle of the debate and, coming on the day on which we got a look at the details of Willard Romney’s Most Excellent Life, that is to be applauded more than mildly.

My point has been proven over and over again, people still stab me in the back to get popular. Nothings changed. it’s still highschool. Then again I work in a club full of 140 immature females. It’s like high school hell. The x rated version. Anyway what did happen to me in high school? Well I finally found out exactly who everyone made me out to be. So this guy Noah liked me, and I had a huge crush on him. That is: until we got really stoned and made out apparently. Then came the vicious phone call, calling me a whore. Then came the daily bull shit of people yelling slut at me every day as I was minding my own business. The came the rumour that I slept with my friend Iain. Apparently I let him fuck me against a wall and he got the name Spiderman and was a total fucking hero. And of course I was a huge slut. All at the age of 16. Right, this cherry still remained to be popped. Of course I’m finding out now that Iain told everyone we had sex in not so many words “I had a condom when I went in there and now it’s gone”. fucking men. No wonder i use them and take all their cash now. Of course Noah’s ex girlfriend, one of my closest friends was furious that he liked me. And of course it was my fault. So here come the vicious rumours about me. Of course any gossip is great gossip. If it involved fucking then even better. And if course years down the road when some nude pictures of me were found those spread around the high school clique like crazy. Funny how these people still even cared. I can honestly say that my life hasn’t been the easiest but I’m grateful that I’m not some suburban chick who just wants to get married to anyone she went to high school with, get knocked up and start popping out babies. I’m meant for much more than that. Being an entertainer it’s a long and lonesome road. But since I don’t trust anyone I think I’ll be okay. So after hearing all these awful things that were all started by people I called friends. Can I find it in myself to forgive Noah. I want to be a bigger person but if my past has taught me anything it’s that people are two faced. There must be some sort of alterior motive. What is this some ploy to get laid? is he doing this for his own purposes so he can stop feeling guilty. Hell I don’t even trust him enough to tell him any of the details of my life. There is no way I’m becoming gossip again if this ‘friendship’ goes sour. Maybe I just hate men. I find this is a common trend in my friendships or with men I like. I sabotage relationships. Every single time I like a guy i find a way to make him hate me. I guess I’m just protecting myself. Or I date guys that I don’t even really like all that much. The strange thing is I appreciate finally getting the answers I needed. the weird thing is when i found all this out, the ash tray on my coffee table suddenly cracked in half. out of no where. wasn’t even touching it. Was this some weird sign that something in me has finally been broken? That I was due for a change. The change I’ve wanted to make so badly all these years? I grabbed my phone to call one of my only friends to tell her about all this and my phone disconnected our call. So I continued to talk to Noah. Maybe I didn’t have all the answers i needed yet. I finally got an apology I could understand after hearing the details of what really happened. The things I had no idea about. I’m trying to find it in myself not to hold him responsible because at the end of the day I make my own choices. One of the things I’m learning about myself if not to let little things get to me. I guess I always did sweat the small stuff. We were just kids and I can’t be bitter about this like I always am. It takes a big person to apologize when they know they were wrong. A lesson i learned very recently after losing a friend to my own stupid behaviours. It takes an even bigger person to forgive someone who has wronged them. The stripper in me is telling me that he’s just another guy. another liar. Whats left of the human in me wants to forgive. I’ve been trying so hard to find the human side of me but it’s been hard. I don’t know how to let people into my life but I’m tired of shutting them out. I’m tired of being stabbed in the back though. I think everyone deserves a second chance, I know I’ve been given my fair share. I don’t think I will ever allow the people from my past into my life but hopefully forgiving Noah is the right move.

Fourth thing was that my bond with two of my friends became strong but you know when bond increases there is always someone that gets jealous or feels insecure about it and issues arise,but still strong bond is there and I hope everything gets cleared out soon between everyone.Well this fourth thing was about my nice experience and nothing about the learning stuff.

Welcome to the first day of the Spellbinders™ Spring Blog Hop! I’m so glad you’re here and get to see what I’ve come up with using many of my favorite Spellbinders die templates. When I start a project, my first thought is the overall message and vision, then I see what possible die templates can add patterns, labels, or embellishments to my layout. The new Bauble Blossoms One and Bauble Blossoms Two are meant to be rolled flowers with quilled centers, but for this layout, I liked the idea of leaving them cut and embossed as is, to create a pattern with them.
Midwestern State University had their big end of the year student art show opening Friday night. Of course, we were there. I would say it was a safe guess that Jesse had more art in the show than any other individual student. Students submitted their art for different categories - some were accepted and some rejected. Jesse had several of her mugs in the show. She had one photograph, one drawing, one sculpture, and several group projects. Monetary awards were given out during the evening.
Today was an interesting day.
He was a ship captain and lived the biggest part of his life traveling around the globe. He always had many stories to tell about different situations he faced during his journeys. He was a good man and worked throughout his life to support his family. Although, I feel sad, I keep thinking that he was lucky enough to see his children creating their own families and also he had the opportunity to watch his grandchildren grow up. Loosing a family person is always hard, but it is a relief to know that he/she has left this world having completed a life cycle.

What this also means is that there will be no shortage of classic Who discs this year, because in addition to the newest releases, here in the States we’re still behind on some half dozen or more discs, so we need to catch up on those as well (this month’s catch up title is “The Dominators”). For at least the first half of the year, every month we should be getting no less than two releases. So if you’re someone who collects all of these, you’d better start pinching some pennies. On the other hand, if you’re someone who just wants to pick up the best titles, I’ll be here, throwing out lofty opinions to aid you in your purchasing decisions. Another nice new addition to the range is the recently unveiled BBC Classic Doctor Who Channel on YouTube, which will be updated periodically with clips from past, current and upcoming DVDs. Be sure to add it your Favorites.

There’s a bulleted list of the services available from this office: neck pain, headaches, back pain, auto accidents, etc. Why anyone would want to contract for the acquisition of any of these afflictions is beyond me, but I’ve never been much of a believer in chiropractics anyway. In addition to decompression treatments, you can also obtain “pregnant patients, sports injuries and children” from this menu of products and services.
Those words can create an amazing range of emotions. Anger, fear, sadness, understanding, interest...the list goes on.
Sam Allardyce and Tony Pulis are two who have made life tough for Arsenal in recent years. Their goal is to avoid addressing any unpredictability in the game, keep the ball out of play for as long as possible and reduce it to a series of short bursts of action. In these situations the manager can have more input, through strategies set out on the training ground and learned by rote – he won’t have to rely so much on the decision-making of his players. It might sound uninspiring, but it tends to work. It’s nothing to moan about – this is the reality of the situation and something to overcome.

The solution to this problem (and I agree that all things being equal, it would preferable to have many more women in science) is not to refuse to have the conversation. If women are less likely to be in science because of family (Summer's guess at the top reason) then institutions could adopt more family friendly policies, as some are already doing. And if social biases are found to be truly a contributing factor, than we can more adeptly and confidently address these biases.

How considerably poker play is required to attain every participation degree? – To get this remedy you will have to uncover out that rate at which poker points are earned. Once you find out the rate that you will generate the factors then you will be ready to estimate the volume of factors that you will generate during the course of a month. From this you should be ready to decide the percentage of rakeback that you will actually be qualifying for.
Finally Bill had an agenda and wasn’t who he seemed to be. He exposed himself after Luce told him she changed her mind about letting Daniel go. This brings about the wrath of Lucifer, Bill’s real identity, which will change everything for all of them.

Naturally, as soon as he said everything that he did I wanted to fold like a napkin, burst into tears and leap into his arms; but maintaining composure was crucial. It’s critical that he knows that he can’t just have me because he’s lonely, and doesn’t want to lose me or have me be with anyone else, while still holding on to all of his prior views of the future. I consulted with my cousin, and my best friend. They both made the excellent points of standing my ground and being careful not to fall back into bad, old habits. Things will have to be different this time.
"Fun", and Fun has no special equipment, just a bat. A adapted wicket is made with two big food cans, and a bottle. The person bats. If the opposing team picks up the ball and topples the wicket, the batter is out. The game is called "Fun" because it is fun, sometimes, not only the bottle topples, the players topple too.
It is actually really cool seeing these two home brewing. I don't brew often enough, but I truly believe that doing so gives you a greater appreciation for all of the great craft brewers out there and you gotta love the satisfaction of trying those first couple of sips of your own concoction and thinking "shit, that tastes pretty damn good."

They were attracted to one another immediately. Perhaps it was the setting, the sound of buoys gently clanking and the far-off lights of mysterious vessels bobbing far a-sea.
The game itself was a blast. My elf sorcerer fireballed six goblins and a rental car. Four were incinerated instantly. Thankfully, the car was among the survivors, otherwise I don't know how we would have made it back in one piece from Goblintown (aka 2050's version of Renton). I didn't get as much chance to get play done as I would have likes, due to character creation, setup, etc, but that's pretty much a given at a first session, is it not?

What I really love about Lawrence Sanders though is his use of words. I’ve said this with authors before, because when it happens, I believe it’s the mark of a truly gifted wordsmith. Sanders uses words not in the standard vernacular of the average person and it’s what sets his work and, in particular the character of Archy McNally, apart from other authors and detective series. Just try one and I bet you’ll be hooked. You don’t have to read the books in order as each is self contained, but I do recommend reading them that way because of the character development. So start with McNally’s Secret, if I can be so bold as to give marching orders to my readers and then let me know what you think.
The printed section on the stationary are instructions to the prisoner and recipient of the letter which I didn't spend the time translating since they didn't hold much information of interest to me. The last few sentences however stick in my mind: Der Tag der Entlassung kann noch nicht gegeben werden. Besuchen im Lager sind verboten. Umfragen sind zwecklos. Release dates cannot be given. Visits to the prison are forbidden. Requests are useless. Very Kafka-esque in it's finality.
These are the same stupid students who created the anti-EDL campaign "Not In Our Name". It consisted of lies against EDL. And even though the EDL JDiv (and other Jews) spent time challenging and correcting these lies, the Union of Jewish Students (UJS) just kept on deleting the truth.
The last two cupcake meetups have been in Brooklyn, so the May meetup returns to Manhattan with a meetup/casual crawl in Chelsea. First, we will meet up at Empire Cake in Chelsea, and then walk over to Chelsea Market where there are three more bakeries to indulge in cupcakes, Eleni's, Amy's Bread and Ruthy's. If it is a nice day, we can congregate after cupcake shopping at The Highline.

When you grow up under a very tight reign, acts of rebellion are small and narrowly focused. For me, it manifested in the rejection of all things light brown.

Because none of us - not one of us - have led a perfect life of milk and honey. We all have, or have had, situations and events in our lives that we wondered if we would ever live through. Maybe it was an abusive childhood, or being rejected in our teen years. Maybe we think we're too fat, or too ugly, or too thin, or too something, and we worry about that and about how others view us. Maybe we're stuck in a bad marriage, or maybe our kids are in trouble. Maybe we have cancer or AIDS, or maybe someone we love is sick or dying. Maybe we are out of money, or have been in the past and still struggle with the notion of having a bit of an easier time. It could be anything, really, past or present. But we all have something that we have either had to overcome, are struggling to overcome, or have given up trying to overcome and are trying our best just to deal with.

Gerald Gaus is one of my favourite political philosophers. His work on the theory of justificatory liberalism, in his 1996 book Justificatory Liberalism and his more recent magnum opus The Order of Public Reason, is provocative, original and rigorous. Admittedly, one of my chief reasons for liking his work is that his opinions seem to chime well with my own, so I’m definitely biased here. But I can only speak from the perspective of my web of beliefs and from that perspective his characterisation of the structural problems of liberal democracy, and his attempted resolution of same seems about right to me.
No big deal, right?

The cost of decent cover for your home is set to soar, as climate change pushes up the twin risks of flooding and subsidence. But, even more frighteningly, around 200,000 homes in Britain could be left uninsurable within the next three months as an agreement that ensures flood-prone properties can continue to be insured comes to an end.

It's been one year already! I can't tell you how fast this year went. I am sitting at my desk staring out my window to an absolutely gorgeous view on a gorgeous New Mexico fall day. I am truly blessed. We have suffered many emotions over the past few weeks. The year anniversary of our little adventure brought joy, fear, tears, gratitude, questions. One thing we believe so strongly is that God is sovereign. HE has ordained our days, HE has ordained our steps, HE has ordained our decisions. As my husband faithfully goes about his days, many questions rear their ugly heads. But we know God is walking with us, He is sustaining us and teaching us how to live this new life. Our children are growing. I am growing and learning how to navigate my sometimes difficult melancholy self!!! One thing I am so grateful for is God's ever present hand on me reminding me that I am His chosen girl. One who He loves and disciplines. I am learning to laugh more often and smile more often, and believe me....I need to do these things more. He has blessed me and cherished me. Our tears are turning to joy....

This blueprint I talk about has five major areas of life; the spiritual, relational, physical, financial, and purpose (career). Each represent a part of every person, young and old. So, I’ve started asking myself certain questions. Why am I here? How can I be the best me? What is God’s will for my life? How do I fulfill my purpose? I’ve started to realize that life is not about achieving my personal best. Life is about fulfilling the unique purpose I was created for. I can now see that much of what I’ve gone through in life has set me up for this very moment. My gifts and passion for health and wellness wouldn’t exist if I hadn’t been forced to take an interest in mine, and the health of those around me. I’ve also become aware of the fact that my spirit is what inhabits my physical body and gives it life; it’s the essence of who I am! Without it, my personality, thoughts, or emotions wouldn’t exist. I would simply NOT be me, and that’s so key to realizing just how important EVERY SINGLE human being is on this planet. We are all here for a reason, and our purpose as a whole is interdependance – it’s why we’re so different from each other!!!

After New Year's, Pierre and I drove to Acadia University, to meet with professors in our prospective departments. We had decided long before that it was a much more affordable option for me to be an international student in Canada than it was for Pierre to come to Florida. Acadia was located in Nova Scotia, about an hour north of Halifax, not far from the Bay of Fundy, in the lovely town of Wolfville. Nova Scotia, according to Pierre, was warmer than Quebec, but still within driving distance of Quebec City, where Pierre's parents lived. Wolfville had an Irish pub, some chi chi restaurants for the professors, and lots of great little student hang-outs. The first time I heard David Gray's Babylon, I was having lunch in a small cafe in Wolfville.

In short, unless we can trade Flower for Hank Lundqvist, the team is not going to do much better.

Next is this little vintage box of title letters for the old movie cameras. I remember Dad had a Super 8 movie camera when I was growing up. I wrote and directed my first film using that camera. My siblings and I then went onto the big chunky VHS camera and made many short films and documentaries. A full length feature my brother, sister and I wrote, directed and starred in was called 'Nightmare on New Street' (we lived on New St). A thriller, come mild horror that starred a meat cleaver hanging from a broom stick with fishing wire. We used a hair dryer to flick pages of books to make it look like a ghost was reading it - it was a classic! At one stage we needed a voice over for one of my little sister's scenes, we were in a bind as she had gone to bed. As my brothers voice hadn't broken yet we used his scream, worked perfectly. I hope we can find the movie one day and it's still watchable, it was a bit of a crack up and even had a gag real to the song Dizzy byVic Reeves with the Wonder Stuff. Ahh, thems were the days.

The shocking moral crimes of the Democrat Party dwarf even Adolf Hitler’s.

I’m sure there are some people out there thinking “A hero from cycling and it’s not Lance Armstrong?” Well, as inspirational as Lance’s story is, there’s a simple explanation – Big Mig was around first. I think the first Tour de France I watched was in 1992, his second victory, and that year, as well as the next two, the story seemed exactly the same. No one could put much time into him in the mountains, and when it came to the Time Trials, he destroyed everyone. 1995 was even greater. Weather played havoc for the later starters in the Prologue, and Indurain was starting last. He got round safely, but was quite far down on GC. On Stage 7, a stage that was expected to be a sprint finish, he rode away from the field along with Johan Bruyneel. The next day he won the Time Trial, took the Yellow Jersey and kept it for the rest of the Tour. It was an awesome performance. But the following year, Big Mig finally cracked. It was the first time as a sports fan that I’d seen somebody who’d been so dominant start to wane, the first sporting king I’d seen dethroned.
Gislenus shuffled without a reason, the time ticking by so fast he never realized he had been circling the hotel he and his parents have lived in for about 9 years. Due to him and his family being poor, he couldn’t afford to move out just yet. Instead of walking to his destination, he meandered back around and stopped at the hidden clearing beside an old church. The clearing looked as dead as could be, but Gislenus knew better. He touched every tree, almost feeling the life vibrating from within them. A rare smile graced his lips. He sighed in contempt, sitting beneath his favorite weeping willow. The boy’s heavy head leaned back, his long, slender throat being exposed.

What forms of anti-religious speech should be prohibited? Not many. As Hitchens has noted, I believe, he wouldn’t stand on the Temple Mount and preach to a crowd of Jews that Muslims are evil and should be killed (or vice versa). That sort of speech does pose an imminent danger to life and liberty. But that’s the rare exception. It should not be illegal to parody or mock any religion in any way, no matter how much those religions’ adherents evince “sensitive feelings” and threaten violence if those feelings are bruised.

The Cairngorms form a natural divide between East and West.

If there is anything potentially more embarrassing than, say, the admission of a amorous proclivity for farm animals, it's the confession that I play the clarinet. In the early 1960s, it seems, the clarinet, easily portable and more abundant than tympani or sousaphone, was the instrument of choice for families who had children in Los Angeles County schools. There were three sections of clarinets in band--adding up to more than 20 musicians--compared with the random bassoonist or trio of euphonium players. For a boy who measured his entire life on being mentally and bodily different from his fellows, the clarinet promised little more than anonymity and an opportunity to create screeching sounds that would scare off all sentient creatures with ears.

Candidate Obama promised that under him, with his meager history of ethics reforms and rhetoric of change and hope and equality, anyone could talk to him and have access to him and that policy decisions would be made for the good of the nation and not by special interests.

my computer for three years this July, and have carried it all across North America with me, it joined me in my three months in Ontario going from city-to-city and house -to- house and has accompanied me on all of my excursions down to America. My battery is also really, well.. I can charge my computer for a time, but when I unplug it instead of having the 7 hours I once had I have about 7 minutes. No cord equals no computer.

In this aftermath, scavengers have taken to scouring the land and seek to control it. They have no intention of returning the lands to their proper owners, nor any intention of maintaining any sort of order other than their own. These scavengers are not friendly, and they have no intention of allowing travelers easy access through these lands. There is no “boss” for these scavengers, it is everyone for themselves.
A great number of boomers have already realized that they may not be able to have as early a retirement as they had planned on In fact, many of these older folks have put off their retirement day well past what we used to consider the traditional age. I am not really discussing putting off the gold watch until past age 65, though that is certainly a good topic for discussion. What I am talking about is leaving work before that traditional date.
He blamed pressure from politicians, campaign staff and even some of the people whom they protect, citing former Vice President Dick Cheney’s daughter, Mary, as a prime example.
Halloween is still a ways off. But for the last couple months I've been eating, sleeping and breathing Halloween! Don't get me wrong, I LOVE it!

I've 14,000 words to write (so far I have 5,000 ish) which needs to be completed and handed in on the 3rd of September. It sounds like loads of time till you factor in the fact that I'm writing about topics I've not studied before so I'm having to learn the topic as I'm writing, my academic supervisor is on holiday in August (how dare he!!) so the majority of it has to be done before he goes away so that I can get his input, 120 patients and carers got involved in my research so I have oodles of raw data that needs coded (which has to be done by the end of this month) and I have a separate report to write for work which needs to be completed by the 14th of August (Bloody GP consortium have decided to bring forward their discussion on the redesign of services for those with long-term conditions and since this work is to represent the patients view on the topic there is no way I can miss that deadline!!).

The chocolate chips are actually like shaved chocolate – so much better than traditional chips, don’t you think?”

Homer Simpson was right. The troops are happier when they get extra tartar sauce. But do the great states of New England take tartar sauce for granted? Has ketchup and malt vinegar reigned supreme in other places? Alas, our countrymen miss so much! Tartar sauce goes great with fried clams on a Saturday night. I love idling by the condiment station in a restaurant, filling up little paper cups with enough tartar sauce to feed a battalion.

That’s how long it had taken her to run through the inheri- tance Granny Beatrice had left her. Twenty-seven months, almost to the day. When she’d left Atlanta for New York, she had such high hopes of making a name for herself as a designer. Marginal successes along the way had not contributed much toward soaring, only toward staying afloat. And even that was in jeopardy now.

So it was out my gate just about every evening, and down this path around 500 meters in the opposite direction from the village into a little tree-lined pasture. On the path were two old oak trees that became a vortex, or portal of sorts for me, for every time I walked past these two trees, everything became silent — there was a definite shift. Far away traffic, birds, insects, and the general buzz of life all stopped here. It didn’t take me long to realize that I was passing into a different time, and a different place — into a land that time forgot.

‘I went away to consider my options, slightly surprised that the hospital’s collective obstetric wisdom could not suggest any strategies for trying to persuade my baby to turn. I consulted every book I could find on the subject, all of which suggested that breech babies could and did turn right up until the onset of labour. But hospital doctors, midwives and my GP all agreed that my baby was firmly stuck and, whether delivered normally or by caesarean, would remain a breech.

If you answered "no" to any of these questions, schedule or not, you need to take a second look at what you are doing and evaluate whether it is the most effective method of teaching for you and your students. Perhaps you need to work on making a more concrete schedule because you, or they, need one. Or perhaps you need to break out of your rigid schedule for a time because your kids (0r you) need to exercise your self-expression and explore some personal interests for a while to bring back the joys of home education.
Dick, to his credit, seems to have been far more aware of the shadow functions’ opportunism and saw in many of the forms it took the outline of his own history. Moreso than Jung, he was eager to share his experiences with others near and dear to him as having a religious content, as bearing upon his destiny as an individual. For this reason, we see more clearly a pattern of compromise and accommodation in Dick. While he never withdrew from a religious attitude toward his experiences, he never fully realized those attitudes in any sort of religious practice.

The drive across the Vercors plateau, alongside the communes of Lans-en-Vercors and Villard-de-Lans, takes no more than 20 minutes. These delightful communes are often designated as "blue/green" by tourist people, because they attract all kinds of snow enthusiasts in the winter season, before becoming a paradise for hikers during the warm months, when the skies of the Vercors are often studded with colorful parachutes.

My other suggestion would be to choose photos that a professional has done or photos you’ve edited yourself. I’m still learning how to use my photoshop program, but the photos I’ve edited are quickly becoming favourites, so why not focus on printing those? I’ve spent the time editing, and since I did edit them I must like those photos so I should probably print them.

I was originally going to have the garnets hanging as a second strand, and then put some leather on it or something, but then the strand of garnets accidentally flipped up as I was working on it and I thought that looked even better, having the strand of garnets form the top part of the necklace. So i took it apart and did that instead. I would have preferred not to add those little rose matte glass beads, but the beading wire wouldn't fit back through the itty bitty holes in the itty bitty garnets and I couldn't find anything more suitable to finish the ends off with. I do have an electric bead reamer but I was afraid the garnets would break if I tried to make the holes bigger. I think it's all right like that. (Brass leaf medallion from Happy Mango Beads.)

He had short black hair, clean smooth skin and a big bright smile. He also wore little round glasses.

In recent weeks I’ve been super frustrated with what I’ve heard on the news and over the internet. I’ve heard issues of women’s rights come up many times and I’ve watched as women, on television, tear each other down over and over again. No wonder guys call it a cat fight! I mean, it’s claws out, nails sharpened, “chicks-be-crazy” insults. Woman are talking about respect and how they’re not getting it. They’re saying that men don’t treat them right. But how about how women treat each other? They’re saying that men are trying to control them, but who’s letting themselves be controlled? Who judges everyone? Who whispers in the locker room? Who’s the first to tear a girl down? Who’s the first to say “she’s a cunt” or “what a slut,” to call out the words home wrecker, whore, bitch, etc. It’s not just the guys.
I've been drinking this for breakfast for the past 2 weeks and have lost 3 pounds.

If your wanting something to keep you satisfied until lunch, try this I think you ll like it.

Collaborative resource planning software’s claims to provide accurate resource details which can help managers in scheduling employees on multiple projects.

Organizations that are serious about optimizing resource utilization should opt for a solution that is collaborative and can be configured to fit around organization’s requirement.
Another great step in this makeover is label reading. Hopefully, most of us are reading labels before we buy the products at the store. But even those of us with the best intentions sometimes shop in a hurry and put items in our carts without looking as closely at the nutrition label as we should. Things to check out include: calories and fat; but also look at the sodium levels, how much cholesterol and sugar are in the items we regularly consume? Read the ingredient list. Are whole grains one of the first ingredients in your crackers and breads? Is sugar one of the first ingredients in the cereal you buy? If you look at these labels, but don’t really understand what it all means for you, seek out a nutrition professional who can guide you through label reading and help you make healthy selections for you pantry.

This week I wanted to go swimming and I prepared everything to go there. I got myself together and made my way to the pool on Tuesday… sadly, the pool has very weird opening hours and it was closed when I went. So I guess I’ll have to give it another chance next week. Monday and yesterday I was in the gym too doing my workout, but I have to say yesterday wasn’t such a good day. I did half of my workout and was very lazy and unmotivated. Just didn’t feel like exercising… I guess you also need some of those days. Tomorrow I’ll be back there and I’ll give it all.

Day 1:
The opening sets the tone of the film, with diegetic sound comprising the totality of the audio track and a combination of close-ups and taut editing propelling the action. The frame opens on a static close-up of an ATM machine before jutting abruptly to the bourgeois home of a young boy named Norbert, who enters his father's office to ask for his monthly allowance, plus an advance to pay off a debt he owes another schoolboy. The father gives his son the allowance but refuses the advance, leading Norbert to a friend who wants to test out a counterfeit 500-franc note. The boys head to a photo shop and buy a frame, paying with the fake bill and even getting change back. When the shop owner returns, he spots the fake but decides to pass it and some others off onto someone else so he doesn't have to eat the loss. He therefore pays the gas man, Yvon (Christian Patey), with the fake bills, which results in the man being arrested when he attempts to use them in a restaurant.

Aside from the frank admission that Britain as a concept is now pretty much constantly blitzed (look at a map of the globe.

When he was very small, his parents kept a German shepherd for friends who had to go overseas for a summer. My dear hubby adored the dog, which was very gentle with him, as shepherds usually are with small children. He would put his hand in the dog's mouth and pretend he was a lion tamer. (I can imagine the little blond imp shrieking with glee at his daring, and it has just occurred to me that my fictional little blond imp, Toby, might bear some relation to my real-life husband as a child.)

Before selecting your cleaning equipment and products, consider the type of boat you have and its composition. This will ensure that you have the right tools and materials in hand for the job. Choose cleaning brushes that are sturdy and will get rid of stubborn dirt, grime and salt, without damaging the finish or gel coat on your boat. A long, sturdy handle on a scrub brush will allow you to reach hard-to-clean areas without bending down, provide leverage, and help eliminate strain on your back and arms. The brush portion should also be right for the specific application. Don’t use a brush that’s too rough, or it could damage your boat’s finish. For most situations, a brush with medium-soft bristles will do just fine. Whatever type or brand of brush you select, make sure the bristle material is durable and strong enough to withstand repeated use, sun exposure, cleaning agents and salt water. In addition to a good scrub brush, be sure to have other necessities, such as a bucket (large enough for your brush), washing pads, a mop, sponges, chamois cloths and towels handy. Store these items in the same place each time, so you won’t have to search for them.
Thanks to all the readers who helped me to receive 4oo hits!! Really! I realize, as a fairly new blogger, that garnering attention toward a blog is not the EASIEST thing to do. It’s prett’ damn hard!

I know things go up as progress go on, but this is just too much. Our government says economy is doing well. I wonder whose economy are they talking about. Not for us average income earners. What more for the low income group. I guess it does for them but not for us end users. I wonder how much would our basic needs be for the next 10 years. Even facilities like water, electricity, telephone, liquefied petroleum gas (cooking gas) and even gasoline boy! – they sure are costly now-a-days. Wouldn’t it be sad to say that things might go back to the old days where people cook using coal, wood, candles and gas lamps for light and bicycle like in China instead of cars. I am puzzled as to what kind of life would this be?

Which is so often the case in a love story or love subplot. And the way he can become a man worthy of her is to stop dreaming about the limo company and DO IT.

It also does not explicitly explain every shit like why the first sight they saw in the milky-way is a cross. The reason behind it is because in the milky-way, there is like this stars that form a bird that spread out its wing in a cross-shaped. Without any astronomy knowledge, you wouldn’t know that but if you just take it with surface value without knowing the symbolism behind it, it’s still a very beautiful and introspecting image that strengthen the mystique of the show. Not to mention, the last sight they saw is also a cross so everything wrapped up nicely even if you don’t understand the meaning behind the first cross.
Things do not go according to plan. This is something I have long since learned, but also something that is never quite easy to retain. In fact, it can mostly be said that things go according to everything but plan. When we arrived to the capital city of the Netherlands early Saturday morning, we didn’t really have many expectations– my two friends and me. We knew we wanted to meet up with the other three of us staying in the city. When we finally reunited, food was the first objective. The second was to drop bags off at our hotel. Once that task was accomplished (after much amusement), our group of six split up to tackle separate Amsterdam tourist highlights. Two of us headed into the Heineken Experience with pre-purchased tickets in hand, and the remaining four of us (chased away by the massive queue out front) left to pursue the Van Gogh Museum before it closed.

My own ever expanding drivel on Occupy attempts to document its rise and development from the afar and inactive position of a stay-home psychogeographic enthusiast. Occupy is the most exciting development in anarchist inspired protest and civil disobedience in my lifetime and I feel the need to bear witness (as Ezra Pound would say), to record the excitement and interpret the various positions as if each camp represents a game of chess, each player earning points for human progress.

Ventilator with battery: 20 lbs
Splurge now. Go buy something at least 2 sizes too small. Something you will look amazing in. Hang it in the closet and look at it about 3-4 times a week. Again, do not hang it up where you can see it every time you walk by, remember, anger makes things worse. FYI, this one trick helped me the most. I had a beautiful, lacy pink top that I couldn’t wait to wear. Also, reward yourself for milestone progress. For every 5-10 pounds that come off, buy yourself something, like new pants, top or dress. Start revamping your wardrobe while you lose the weight. Guys, this goes for you also. Side note, as your clothes become too big, donate them or give them away. Get them away from you, this way, you have nothing to fall back on and if you gain a little back, you’ll have more incentive to lose it because your clothes will be uncomfortable.
I made this card with Earth Day in mind, using a green leafy pattern, a green and Spring iris striped paper and kraft cardstock. I love the way the color of Kraft cardstock blends with the other two colors. The CPS sketch #262 was perfect for the image and sentiment.
All that said, I still do have dreams of being more organized ahead of time. I'd like to have all our amazing ideas mapped out (to a certain extent) so that in times when I am less functional, I can just pull out a book that tells me what I am supposed to be doing and don't have to think up anything, or choose to just put the kids in a holding pattern, doing work online or watching a topic-related movie. Not that I think there is anything inherently bad with either of those options, or I wouldn't be using them, but I think there is something to be said for striving to always make improvements and adjustments. To help me with those goals, I asked my husband to buy me the Planning Your Charlotte Mason Education dvd and book set for my birthday in June, and was hoping to have time this summer to really dig into it. Nope. Not yet. But it is in my drawer, waiting for a chance to be heard and learned from. Perhaps during the Christmas season, there will be time to sit and watch and sew a bit...sigh.

I’m fortunate enough to live the next town over from this cute country tearoom. I sit down and enjoy afternoon tea here at least once a month, sometimes I’ll go every week. I buy most of my tea from here as they have a wonderful and varied selection of loose leaf teas.
Next I filled in the white between blooms with V91, a very light but gray purple. This gave a base purple tone to the back, over which I added C3 to darken up the shadow areas. On the underside of the whole bloom I shadowed with the C3 then to deepen up the purples under there I used hints of V17.
It's not too late for a do-over. Every day is just that, right? I get caught up in wanting to be the bestest and get stuck. I'm determined to not have such a long list in the end...maybe just "eat more vegetables" or "exercise more"...none of this really important stuff of regrets.
Other than Ballet, I have been an active member in school Coral Speaking team and participated at the national level. Despite having finished my secondary education from pure science stream; I faced difficulties to opt between study accountancy and anthropology. Anthropology is something which really stirred up my interest to carry out in-depth examination of context cross-cultural comparisons. However, having an interest on accountancy was purely because of calculating with currency seems something fascinating to me. After all, I have chosen to become a chartered accountant and later I was sent to Manchester to further my studies.

LÄPPLE: In 1952, while I was about to leave my post teaching the Pastoral Theology of the Sacraments at the Freising seminary, I decided to go to Bishop Faulhaber to tell him that my most suitable successor in the post would be Joseph Ratzinger. Who in fact, on 1 October, took over my post. So began his academic career. I’ve never told him that I went to the bishop to suggest his name. But I like to think that perhaps that intervention

Chanel's Holiday 2011 Collection finally arrived at my local Nieman Marcus counter. I was ecstatic to see the collection on Chanel's website last night, but still want to see the items in person before committing. I went to the counter with only foundation and no lipstick, blush, or eyeshadow in preparation to test out the products. Here I share some thoughts and swatches with you.
One of the few films that I'll watch with the subtitles switched on, the dialogue is like listening to twisted poetry as spoken by an over rehearsed gaggle of drug addicts. Take, for example, the dinner party scene: the amount of sheer funniness in this segment never fails to bring a single tear to my urethra. A classic, not only in terms of comedy, but in terms of depicting humanity in an honest and forthright manner.

In conjunction with my last post regarding wasting time, I decided to try to start figuring my shit out. I realized my priorities are warped. I obsess over things that don't matter--wasting hours upon hours mindlessly surfing the internet, playing the game over boys who are maybe interested in me--because I have no clue what I want to do.

I’ve sold around 7000 books so far and yes, I think I have made money from it, but it’s all ploughed back in for the next one. Does that count? Selling to schools is better financially. With events at Waterstone’s there is a percentage to negotiate depending on the terms you have with them. It’s the same with W H Smith, but I get a better deal with them – with self-publishing comes knowledge …
This is one of the most interesting films I have ever seen, if not the most interesting. It is like no other movie ever, a true original delivered by one of the most out of the box writers out there. Charlie Kaufman is on another level when it comes to writing – he is a genius. This movie is a great example of how imaginative and different he is; it is such a crazy movie. He is more known for his other films like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, but this has always been my favorite of his films, with Adaptation being an extremely close second. On the DVD cover Peter Travers of Rolling Stones magazine is quoted describing this movie as “A smart, sexy, and seriously funny comedy.” That leads me to wonder if he actually saw the film. I would hardly call it funny at all much less describe it as “a seriously funny comedy.” This movie is about love and loss, pain and heartache, and the emotional roller coaster relationships tend to be. I find myself having difficulty trying to categorize it because it is so different than everything else. I considered leaving it as a lone “uncategorized” film before settling on just creating a new category for “love story,” but never once considered placing it in comedy.
By the time I entered Porter Junior High in Granada Hills, I had graduated to a wooden clarinet, which broke apart into two main sections, along with a barrel, bell, and mouthpiece that you sorted into proper slots in the velvet-lined storage case. It took months to learn how to play it without hitting one of those bone-chattering screeches. The instrument was powered by a slender bamboo reed that you soaked in your mouth for five minutes before assembling the clarinet. Once moistened, the reed vibrated evenly and if you built up an embouchure (training the muscles of your face to clench securely about the mouthpiece), you could avoid unwanted notes that diverted highway traffic for miles.

As emotionally engaging as it is to watch the survivors in 2012 choose their better selves over their lives, it’s not … uplifting. We respond to it because we know human failure, we see ourselves in the conflicted people on the screen, and we don’t know what option we would choose if we were them. We cry at that scene (well, some of us do) because we fear we would choose poorly; we smile at their choice because it is a thin tendril of hope that, if it really happened, maybe we would do better too.

The Sixers will be lead by third year point guard Jrue Holiday, age 21. Holiday is now the unquestioned floor general for the Sixers going forward. He averaged 14 points and seven rebounds last season for the Sixers in his first full season as the starting point guard. He looks to be the first piece of the backcourt combination that the Sixers plan to use for years to come. The second part of that equation is second year shooting guard Evan Turner. After an up and down rookie season, Turner is poised to earn a starting spot in Collin’s rotation. There have been questions as to whether he and Andre Iguodala can start together and Turner has stated that he and Iguodala worked in the offseason on their chemistry. Turner also worked with famed Philadelphia University coach Herb Magee on his inconsistent jumper. Time will tell if all the work will pay off for Turner.
With each day that passes, I seriously respect the women that do this on a regular basis more and more. Clearly (for me at least) it’s not something that everyone can do, as evidenced by my psyche at the end of each day. In 4 weeks I will be back at work fulltime, and I know that I will be thinking of this period as one of the best in my life.
Let me repeat--minor depression, and little pit of despair. I'm working on it, it's transient, and I will be fine.

But “Frozen” on its own merit is very bland. There is surprisingly little drama. You have a claustrophobic and isolated setting with nine people stuck in a small biodome in Antarctica with the added tension of them falling deathly ill with no medical help in reach, but it is all wasted. The characters show hardly any emotion at all in their plight. Heck, one would think cabin fever would get to them even if a lingering death from an incurable virus is not enough to cause emotions to boil over.

It was an ambitious prospect to develop a sequel to Ridley Scott’s 1979 science fiction horror classic Alien. However, Twentieth Century Fox was highly pleased with what burgeoning filmmaker James Cameron was putting to paper that they waited until he finished production on The Terminator to have him complete that script. It became a huge blockbuster hit in the summer of 1986, and earned several nominations and awards. Unfortunately, for me, there has always been something about this film I never quite liked, something that made it nowhere near as great as people made it out to be. Add to that the disdain I’ve developed in recent years for James Cameron. I don’t think he makes films as good as he thinks he does, he has a huge unwarranted ego, and his pioneering of 3D digital technology really burns me. I hate the trend, and I hate Cameron for igniting it. I will truly brush these feelings aside, and critique this film as it is to pinpoint my issues with it. There’s plenty for me to deconstruct here.
All of the under twenty - Six Nations home Welsh Rugby international games this year and next, will be played at the new Eirias Park stadium in Colwyn Bay. I would like to urge all supporters of the oval ball in the North to try to attend one or more of these matches.
In the map above, it looks similar to a route, and although giving Romney the industrial states of Michigan Ohio and Wisconsin may appear to be a bit risky, it is based on who might get out to vote, and who might just stay home – with every indication that the youth vote could care less, and that there would have to be some sort of miracle between now and November to turn the tide on the price of gas, food, and goods, and create several million jobs, (in the private sector), while uniting not only the Democrat Party but the Independents and yes some Republicans – in this mind, not likely. Even with the dead voting, with the current climate in Massachusetts, the state has been given to changing minds in Carter-like election years: as well as several of the other states given to the President as “solid” Democrat. It is more likely that the race will depend, this time, on the persona of the individual, or their ties to figures in recent history (i.e. tying Romney to Bush is similar to tying Obama to Clinton – no one is buying it – unless one is speaking to the “choir.)

I miss Eddie Murphy being funny like this. His presence was literally the only interesting thing about this movie (aside from a 30 second scene between him and the girl from Precious which was in the trailer). Other than this, there’s barely anything to make me remember it at all. Eddie Murphy still has it in him somewhere. That is all.
It is about time to bring our southwest trip to a close. Beginning in Phoenix (Arizona Birding), we made our way to the Grand Canyon (Who Stole the Grand Canyon), then Zion National Park (Shroud over Zion), and finally arrived at Bryce Canyon National Park. Except for gale-force winds, we couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful day to welcome us to this geological wonderland! Some fresh snow from the previous night lingered, while the clouds were working their way in an easterly direction. The biting wind-chill kept many of the tourists at bay, so those of us that braved the day were rewarded with a peaceful visit. As astounding as the hoodoos, cliffs and weathered mountainsides were, the cloud formations were amazing, and really enhanced the breathtaking landscapes. Unfortunately the images posted below don’t do justice to the scenes, but if you haven’t yet visited Bryce Canyon, they might at least give you some encouragement to make it a destination on your bucket list. All of the images will open to a larger format if you click on them.
There are complexities to it such as whether the dyed threads are the ones held tightly lengthwise on the loom (the warp fibers) or the ones used to weave in and out of the warp fibers, creating the cloth (the weft fibers) – or both the warp and the weft fibers, creating a more intricate and complex pattern, but basically that’s it.
I’m not a packrat. I don’t like clutter or a messy house and I have periodic cleaning, recycling, give-away episodes; but, I’ll just say it: I like my stuff. Of course, by “stuff” I refer to sentimental objects, furniture hand-me-downs from family members, picture frames, books, blankets, dinnerware. I could never be someone who lives in a minimalist or tiny house with barely any belongings to her name. These objects – this stuff – holds memories and plays a role in making a house a home. I’m a sentimental fool when it comes to random objects, particularly those given to me by grandparents.

As valuable as radar was, it wasn’t without its limitations. Radar would tell a ship where an airplane was, in terms of range and bearing. But that information was of little use without knowing where the target was heading, and how fast. By manually plotting range, bearing and time information and using a little trigonometry and a maneuvering board, the radar operator could determine the targets course, speed, and best course for friendly fighters to intercept. Against one or two piston powered airplanes, that was sufficient. But plotting took significant time, and more than one or two targets overwhelmed the manpower available .

And this is reflected, I would argue, in the results. When people are bludgeoned into this living-of-life-to-avoid-conflict, sooner or later, you always see someone, somewhere, laboring under a commandment that they need to stop living life, or to live less life. So that someone else isn’t offended. Very often, the “someone else” doesn’t actually exist, and is thought about only as a hypothetical: “Take that American flag down, someone might find it offensive.”

Professor Marable is scrupulous about the facts; he does not make assumptions as to what Malcolm was thinking or feeling that he cannot back up. As suggested by the subtitle, Malcolm Little reinvented himself several times. Perhaps for those reasons, I finished the book with a stronger sense of Malcolm X as a man of history than anything else. But that's a minor quibble with a major book.

From the kitchen of One Perfect Bite...Gael Greene is a woman of great appetites, only one of which will be covered here today. I've left the more titillating aspects of her biography for others to tell and if you are interested, this is one of many articles that will bring you up to speed on facets of her life that are not included here. I knew very little about her until I began to gather information for this post. Not all the luminaries from the early days of the NYC food scene had reputations that made it past the Hudson River. At that time, Craig Claiborne, Mimi Sheraton and Marian Burros were well-known in the Chicago area, and, being nothing if not loyal, those were the names I carried with me when we made the reverse migration from Chicago to New York. For better or worse, I was a New York Times gal. Gael wrote for the New York Post and New York magazine, so I'm embarrassed to say her columns were never on my radar. Following graduation from the University of Michigan, she began her career as a reporter and freelance writer. She became a restaurant critic only after being asked to do a column for New York magazine. She took the job because association with the gifted pool of writers on the magazine roster would be interesting, and, better still, those costly meals for which she became famous could be expensed. Later, it became the vehicle that afforded her time to work on her novels, a list of which can be found here. These days, she still does freelance writing and serves as a judge on the television program, Top Chef. She is probably best known for her role as co-founder of Citymeals-on-Wheels, an organization that raises funds to deliver food to the housebound elderly.

So, I left without more than a verbal promise of monies owed; I was sold a lemon by a second hand car dealer; I try to avoid British products from British companies which do more for the governments of Ireland, Holland, Luxembourg, the Cayman Islands or a thousand other places:… do you think me stupid? foolish? naive? Probably. But, on reflection, I’m happy with that. You see, I expect more of people and try my best to live up to my own expectations, rather than down to theirs. If you meet me, I hope you’ll find me honest, if stupid; trustworthy, if naive; and unselfish, if foolish. And I expect the same of you. Please, please, don’t let me down.

At first these new changes might cause tension because there will be some who will test her new authority. Sheila must stay resolute and not falter in achieving her goals, while always remaining respectful.

They will realize that the changes she’s advocating are also in their best interests.

The ruffles were done using the v0000 with a little v000 thrown in for shading. The teal part of the skirt was done using a combination of the e40-whites and bg0000.

As a citizen concerned with the depth and breadth of what appears to be an obvious attempt to defraud not only the citizens of the state of Ohio, but the entire nation, I have requested, but have yet to receive from any Government official, any coherent answer to questions I have posed regarding the impact on my business interests, my rights as a property owner, my personal liberty as a citizen of the state of Ohio, and that further restrict and diminish my overall freedom as an American.
The only other concern I have is the initial cost of getting everything set up in a way that doesn’t take me two hours to care for them all every day. I enjoy spending time with them, but it can get to be a bit of a hassle when you’re on a time crunch for whatever reason. I have looked at a lot of commercial options and have come to the conclusion that they really don’t suit my needs as I want them to. This means I will have to invest the time and money to build my own system that I hope will work as well as what’s been proven already.

Liverpool have the potential to have their best week for some time, a win at the Reebok could put them in the top five by the close of weekends play, should Arsenal and Newcastle fail to win.

I can't wait to revisit these characters when the next book comes out.

This is just for family. He has never had a friend party. I am holding off on the friend party thing until next year. Do your kids have friend parties? What do you do for them?
We have directed, controlled and imprisoned ourselves and each other, by creating boundaries, the idea of “the others’, religion, and many more stereotypical notions that mislead us into thinking we are all different, but eventually we find ourselves captives of our own doings. I have deluded myself with excuses and lies that helped me blame my wrong doing on others and my misfortunes on others. I should be ashamed.

She might make it yet. If the Church can determine that she lived a life of heroic virtue and two miracles are attributed to her, she's in. I find it difficult to imagine that will happen any time soon, in this political climate. As we sit here today, she would assuredly be accused of "class warfare". People like Dorothy Day are always shouted down.
Specifically, the floating auditorium includes "three inter-connected sonic instruments which mix traditional craft and digital innovation. They draw water from the River Tyne, passing it through a series filters, lasers and sensors, which bubble, beep, hiss, creak and groan." For at least one instrument, the resulting sounds are determined by the salt-content of the water: "A wooden mechanism then dips a series of electrodes into the jars and creates a series of sounds. The pitch of the sounds will be modified depending on the salinity levels of the water."
To get to the Siecha Lakes entrance you can take public transport from Bogota to a town called Guasca. From this town you will take another bus for 30 minutes (running every hour or so) that will drop you at the end of the road, then it’s a 1 hour 20 minute walk up the dirt/mud track to the entrance of the park. If that’s all a bit too much before taking the 4 hour hike, you could also book a tour with Makuna Ecotravel, an eco tourism company, who will organise transport, reservations and a guide for you. And of course, the third option, if you don’t have your own car, is to make friends with someone who has one, preferably an off-road type that will get you all the way up the muddy track.

Tonight I'm taking a break from rest-of-life because I just acquired something AMAZING.
Madison, Wis--Scott Walker was interviewed by the Green Bay Press Gazette and in that interview he just kept saying how he fixed the economy. It didn't matter what question he was asked, his response was that he fixed it. And at times he appeared so nervous that he moved around in his chair like Ray Charles used to do when playing the piano.
I’m not talking about the Colt’s number one pick of quarterback Andrew Luck; the place was buzzing over the last pick in the draft: Chandler Harnish from Northern Illinois. By being selected dead last in the draft, Chandler captured the dubious honor of being named “Mr. Irrelevant.”
I used coconut milk in lieu of heavy cream for vegan ice cream aficionados (dieters be warned: the saturated fat content is alarmingly high even though it's vegan), but the difference in taste is unnoticeable, even to the sophisticated palate. Coconut milk is my preferred alternative for use with very strong flavors that will mask the flavor of coconut; milder flavors like vanilla and pistachio don't work so well.
By far the most interesting part of my trip was a question that I got repeatedly: "Why do you render by hand?" To be honest, the first student at MASSArt who asked me that left me feeling a little taken aback. I wanted to respond with; "What do you mean why?!" But it is a legitimate question. I fell back on the simplest answer; training. Some of my earliest work when I was younger was with hand rendering. And since that was what I learned, that's what I use. And I repeated this response several times throughout the day all the while aware that while this answer was correct, it wasn't the full answer. I wasn't really sure what the full answer was--I just knew that wasn't it.

As a general guideline, the following are the brewing temperatures for the different types of tea, steeping time, and number of infusions. I was at a tea shop several weeks ago and I was introduced to a different method called gong fu cha method. Tea leaves are infused in a clay Yixing teapot for 30 seconds at the suitable temperature and then served immediately. The result is interesting in that each infusion has a different character. Despite the different ways of brewing tea, there’s no “right” way because it depends on the drinker’s preference. Some like their tea light and some like them bitter.
This generation needs you! They are looking to people who can answer those four simple questions they are asking.

I run another blog; one that gets updated far more often than this one does. As a result I get a lot of comments, and even more spam. Every now and then I like to take a look at this spam just to see if anything real slipped by, because a. filters aren’t perfect and b. I crave acceptance and positive reinforcement, without which I am nothing. Here is a selection of some comments that warmed my heart, that I can look to when I doubt myself and my dedication to my blog.
David A. Bosnich of the Acton Institute has written a very informative article explaining one of the key principles of Catholic social thought, the Catholic teaching of subsidiarity and sheds some light as to why the United States Catholic Bishops support statism, centralized government, as the primary solution for fixing social problems.
College XC is starting to get going and the top runners are slowly making their debuts. The much anticipated debut of German Fernandez led to a 6th place finish at the Cowboy Jamboree. It seems as he and teammate Colby Lowe ran it as a controlled tempo run as they finished together. OSU's Girma Mesecho won the race. It is a promising start for OSU who brought in a tremendous recruiting class. I did notice that Kirubel Erassa was held out. Stanford ran as a controlled pack as well at the Stanford Invite. Chris Derrick, Elliot Heath and Jacob Riley all came across the line together about 4 seconds behind winner David McNeill (NAU). Stanford looked very, very good as they did last year up until NCAA's. An interesting development is Jakub Zivec coming on at Florida State University. Refer to my blogs from the 2008 XC season if you need any info on this tremendous talent from Czech Republic.
I divided the meat into four 1 pound servings and two ½ pound servings. I wasn’t sure what I was going to make but I figured as my kids are usually good about my “experiments” I would just try to wing it.

This is a bad instagram picture but as you can see my cupcakes fell apart. So I sent Adam to the store for some whipped topping, cooked my fresh strawberries in some sugar and mashed ‘em up, and then layer, layer, layer! SUPER easy and it comes out tasting like strawberry short-cake. Amazing.

firms, which are perceived as being the source of more innovative software, patent much more heavily than their Indian and Irish counterparts. While a number of reasons might explain this pattern, it is certainly consistent with the view that patents correlate closely with R&D and innovation – which would tend to refute the early 1990s argument that patents are anathema to software innovation. In addition, it can be said that the Israeli software industry is in no sense highly concentrated. So the comparative data once again supports the notion that predictions concerning the concentration-increasing effects of software patents have failed to materialize. Entry to Market - since the software industry claims large sources of innovation from both large and small companies, a steady flow of new entrants would indicate a robust industry that seeks to establish innovative ideas or products. After reviewing the level of startup activity between 1970 and 1998, and considering the venture capital funding amounts between 1995 and 2005, Professor Merges findings indicate that software startups and financing activity have continued to do quite well.

Although I haven't quite finished the outlet cover, I've also painted it in chalkboard paint. It still needs to be conditioned but it was quite easy to do. I just held it by the screw on the underside and used the roller leftover from painting the walls to do it really quick on a couple different nights.

We call Alberta Little Texas, known for oil, cattle ranching and rednecks. The KKK has a stronghold there. It’s part of the Bible Belt, a strip that runs into the US and known for ultra-conservatism, right wing, religious views. But Alberta does have pockets of other…somewhat. In a way it was surprising to see the rise of the Wildrose Alliance to challenge the Conservative party’s 40-year rule. I didn’t pay a lot of attention but when the media said the Wildrose was right of the Conservatives a friend asked, “What, is it Attila the Hun?” There is something right of this? Wow. But then Alberta was the birthplace of the federal Reform party (or Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance party as they were known until it was pointed out it spelled CCRAP) which was a right wing answer to the federal Conservatives. The Reform party was absorbed back into the Conservative party and that’s when Harper and his ilk gained power. There have been accusations that the Wildrose party emulates attitudes that were found in the Reform party, such as homophobia, racism and narrow views about the rights of a woman to her own body.
On that note, I have made an appointment with another doctor. He has come highly recommended. I am going to take along my scan of my pouch and fingers crossed he can help me out (actually it’s gotta be better than the one I was seeing)…I so miss my doctor in Dubai…he was my saviour right up to the week that I left. But I just can’t keep making excuses anymore…I need to take action and sort this out before it gets out of control…I don’t like this feeling of being out of control and I certainly don’t like this feeling that all I am doing is focusing on weight loss/weight gain/diet/negative emotions etc….that was a cycle I vowed would stop 2.5 years ago…but that old feeling is slowing returning and I want it to stop.
At one point, I remember that Pam stretched herself out on the front of the raft like the senior wife of a sultan on a yacht. I wasn't quite as carefree as she since, you know, I was privy to the building process. I was a little more clingy. Bwha.
"You and I, as we live daily, even moment-by-moment in the marketplace, are involved in a holy calling and work. We have not been called to the pulpit of a church, but to the "bully pulpit" of a business. We don't prepare sermons every week - we prepare budgets. Wed don't quote the scriptures from the podium - we need to live them. We are the front line troops. If it can't happen through us, it won't happen at all. If God's Word isn't as valid and binding on Monday as it is on Sunday, it isn't valid at all."
For some who don’t know Ray J is an on again off again music artist, reality TV star and actor. At one time, he was more popular for simply being musical artist, Brandy’s brother. At this point with the popularity of Kim Kardashian, he is better known as the guy in the explicit video that raised her to prominence, through that “private” tape being leaked to the public. The bottom line is, he is more popular for who he is associated with, than what he has accomplished personally.

It would be incorrect to say that night #2 went perfectly, but does anything ever go perfectly. I would say it went well.. rather well.. very well. No problem with second night blahs or whatever seems to happen. Of course, 3 nights left and tonight is the big middle o the run.. so who knows. At this point we're veterans though, and I reckon it'll all be more and more awesome from here.. at least, I'm supposed to say that.
Many business owners find that their businesses are running them instead of running their business. They get run into the ground and find little reward or success. This path may include a fear of change.
Stacey: My first signing in Oxford, Mississippi at Square Books Junior is my biggest rock star moment. They had an after party with a punk band and the lead singer had composed a song titled "You are so undead to me" in honor of my book. I was blown away. Best signing ever. Thank you Jill and all the folks at Square Books! (Wish I still had the link to the video of the song. It was awesome.)

Anyone surprised Amari had her second birthday last weekend? Seems like only yesterday she was a sweet, innocent, mine-free toddler, running about, sharing shit, and not giving a damn what was who's. Seriously. Overnight - like a Mine Fairy came down and left a possessive pronoun pamphlet under her pillow. The sixty-four thousand dollar question now is how to find a balance between allowing her to assert herself and teaching her to share. I'm already getting some ideas from the books we have and from other parents who have suffered before me.

Thanks to Poppy King’s expertise in lipstick formulas, Supercalifragilipstick has a creamy texture and good staying power. Last but not least, its packaging has a fun mechanism: you press the top down gently, instead of pulling it, and then the tube pops open by itself! The swivel-up section is marked “PUCKER UP,” which makes us smile...all the better for applying lipstick.
Many Boers trekked further into the hinterland, reaching Sarmiento, where they found arable land and running water. The area is an oasis compared with the harsh Patagonian semidesert surrounding it and reminded the Boers so much of their abandoned South African farmland that they decided to set up camp permanently. They planted willows and elms for windbreaks and to prevent erosion, and Sarmiento bloomed.
Why are some people more religious than others? Answers to this question often focus on the role of culture or upbringing. While these influences are important, new research suggests that whether we believe may also have to do with how much we rely on intuition versus analytical thinking. In 2011 Amitai Shenhav, David Rand and Joshua Greene of Harvard University published a paper showing that people who have a tendency to rely on their intuition are more likely to believe in God. They also showed that encouraging people to think intuitively increased people’s belief in God. Building on these findings, in a recent paper published in Science, Will Gervais and Ara Norenzayan of the University of British Columbia found that encouraging people to think analytically reduced their tendency to believe in God. Together these findings suggest that belief may at least partly stem from our thinking styles.
I don't really have a whole lot to say about Lockout. It could be because I'm not in a writing mood tonight. Which I suppose isn't fair for the movie I'm reviewing...but Lockout doesn't have much to go on. Not to say it's a horrible movie, because it isn't. I've seen much worse action movies. Lockout though doesn't offer anything all that new or interesting to action movies or sci-fi movies. I do like the premise though of the prison in space where the prisoners are in stasis. Although, it doesn't seem like much of a punishment if they are sleeping the whole time.

Another intriguing, well written story by Dan Walsh with a little suspense/mystery to keep your nose into the book from page one. I was as excited as Michael was, though I had it all figured out before he did. This was just a nice pleasant read that anyone will enjoy. The characters were real and we grow to love them immediately, though Jenn didn’t seem to share Michael’s enthusiasm as much as she should have. However she was happy with Michael’s huge inheritance.

A police car rolled up quickly and silently. Two officers with shaved heads hustled up the steps with hands on their guns. They ran into the house as Ann, no longer the girl, walked immediately out with her arms wrapped tightly around herself. She looked nowhere but straight down as she walked with the same firmness with which she arrived. She didn’t tell Chris to follow, but he thought it better.

David had loved Cassandra. He loved her so much. He probably would have traded his whole career in for her. He would have risked his life to save hers. He would have done anything for her. He could not imagine not loving her. He couldn't wait to marry her, although he was way too young. And he did worry that Hollywood was a jinx on marriage. But he had hope that they could beat the odds. Grow old together.

I had mentioned back in the summer that I was afraid I would be making my word study games the weekend before we used them. Well, guess what? We're studying the Long O CVCe pattern this week. Today, I made the games! This not looking like a good start. Will I be spending every Saturday making games this year? I know I won't have to do that next year, because the games will be made, BUT it's a lot of work this year. I need to find some way to get ahead.

In all the television and film adaptations except one, Jane Eyre is beautiful. So is Mr Rochester. We are okay living with uglies, but how many of us can stand looking at one on-screen? Occasionally there are ugly characters on television, but the story revolves around their ugliness, because there is no way people can treat an ugly person like they were normal. It might be sad, but we all like a little eye candy, don’t we? Besides, if Jane were ugly on-screen, then we’d need six different characters telling her she were ugly, and that would seem strangely out-of-place.
The film's title stems from a short poem by the British poet William Ernest Henley, first published in 1875, that Mandela often recited to himself while imprisoned on Robben Island. The key final lines are: "I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul." Francois finds meaning here too as he seeks to lead his team to victory.

If Chris Schwinden was supposed to be the answer, today the realization solidified that he is just one more question. With as much potential as the Mets supposedly have in the minor leagues, nothing seems ready to come up anytime soon, and with Mike Pelfrey now on the DL for at least the rest of the season – and probably the beginning of next season, if he’s back with the Mets at all – you have to wonder if there’s any way in the world this team can compete for a full five days in the rotation. When you look at the bullpen that previously looked pretty challenging, you realize now that Manny Acosta isn’t fit to be out on the mound, and the double F’s and double R’s are as hit and miss as they come. Today when they were grumblings that Mike Baxter might actually have to come in to pitch, I was actually looking forward to seeing what he might be able to do because there was no way that it could possibly be any worse than Acosta et al. Right now, you really do wonder how in the world Mets fans can possibly look forward to any games with any lead being secure going into the seventh, eighth, and ninth innings of any game with a bullpen this leaky. I never thought I’d be saying this, given his performance over the last three or four seasons, but this end of the rotation makes me wish that Mike Pelfrey was going to be around to be the work horse he was touted as being.

It was 1999 and Danielle was a ten year old with cerebral palsy who was non-speaking and non-ambulatory. Although she would soon have a defined yes/no we weren't there yet. She lay on a mat in my classroom in the city and cried. We tried music, favorite toys, hand lotion and massage and even scolding her to stop. She didn't. Finally I verbally listed body parts to her from the toes up touching each one and she stopped crying when I said "do your thighs hurt?" Two days later we have confirmation of a femur fracture from previously undiagnosed brittle bones. I filed away the memory of connection between the unusual behavior and the student being in pain.

For Obama, what’s not to like? More beneficiaries, more votes. He can't run on being the man who sprang to America's attention at the 2004 Democratic convention talking about there not being a red America or a blue America, but the United States of America. In 2008 he could run as the great uniter. Now, after being in office for over three years, he doesn't have policy successes that appeal to voters so the only strategy he has left is to run as the Great Divider.
I may be overreacting here, but there's a possibility that this is another early sign of things going back to the way they were: less choice instead of more in the beer market. ("Another" sign, you ask? The consolidation of craft brewers is one: the Magic Hat/Pyramid/North American Breweries roll-up, Goose Island, Old Dominion, Widmer/Redhook/Kona.) If wholesalers start to focus on the big craft brands, that's how things are going to go.

But what if we respond to the child in the opposite way? When you’re angry with a friend or partner, do you want them to battle back with you? Probably not. That just leaves you feeling discouraged and wondering why he or she doesn’t understand you. What if, on the other hand, the person we were angry with said something like, “I can see how mad that makes you,” or “You’re really mad at me,” or “That really hurt you?” Even if we are being irrational with our words and behaviors, there is a quality to that level of response that helps to diffuse the situation. Maybe a more balanced discussion of the issues can be had at a different time. But when someone responds to our anger with compassion, we feel less defensive and we pull back from our attack.

My role at this time was to promote the festival via social networks and to engage with businesses in the city to encourage a programme of fringe events. As the negativity towards the festival grew my role changed to become more of a crisis management role, responding to enquiries and comments, meeting those who had strong views and finding out more about what the target audience wanted. I was the link between the client team and their target audience and advised on public opinion, areas that we still had to time to make changes to and where we needed to change our thinking.
I’m all for it. Of course, I agree with Vin and want to see what happens and whether he can pull it off. I think that his heart being in the right place and his quest for revenge aren’t mutually exclusive, especially if his quest for revenge prevents other people from suffering the same fates that he and his wife did. I still want to know more about exactly what happened in the Pits. After reading the last little bit of what happened in the Lord Ruler’s palace, I’m wondering if maybe he never was betrayed by anyone, but rather he stumbled upon something he wasn’t supposed to know about that happened to be heavily guarded anyway. Nobody knew he was on his way, which means that either someone can read minds or those Inquisitors were already there.

But I'm also really sad for the families that went before me that are still waiting to clear Embassy. It's hard when you're stuck in a particular step and you're watching (what seems like) everyone else fly past you. I am very mindful of those families. And those that are waiting. It's a hard spot to be in when you feel like it's never going to happen for you.

My house is still a work in progress, I have a few things left to sell, so the spare room is still housing these things. And I am still clearing things each day!
The present God defined in the 28 fundamental beliefs is the Catholic Trinity concept of God—a false God. This concept is required for membership into the World Council of Churches. Can one God lead us out of Babylon in 1844 and a different God lead us into the Heavenly Canaan?

and one misappropriation of the chain
The first thing you need to decide is whether you want to be a sole proprietorship or if you want to incorporate. I'm not going to have any other employees so I'm a sole proprietorship doing business with my SS# as my tax ID. In my state and county (Fairfax), I needed to go to the County Courthouse and register a DBA ("Doing Business As") name (which is "Stamp 4 Life"). A DBA name allows me to open a business checking account under that name and thus, accept checks written out to "Stamp 4 Life." My bank only needed my DBA certificate--the manager said many people don't realize that. By the way, registering the DBA took 10 minutes and $10--not a big deal at all--I even had my 3 year old with me and it was like a field trip for him!

Reading looms wonderfully large in my life at the moment, as I’m chairing the Orange prize for 2012 and there will be something north of 135 novels to read over this winter, of which there already is a considerable tower waiting…..I am so pleased to be chairing this particular prize, which has not only rightfully earned its place in the ranks of literary prizes by coming up with some truly excellent winners, but also because it’s open to women writers all over the world, and I thoroughly approve of that! So, apart from the Orange books, I have three of my own choice on the go – Adam Gopnick’s “Paris To The Moon”, Shyam Selvadurai’s “Funny Boy” (I meant to read that while I was actually in Sri Lanka, but I couldn’t wait!) and David Brooks’ intriguing “The Social Animal”.

What else are we meant to gain if Christ has already “blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing” (Eph 1:3)? What else are we to acquire if we are told to ”count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus” (Phil 3:8). What are we to gain that we haven’t gained already?

I plan to run in the Heartland 50-mile trail race with a couple of trail-running buddies. Afterward, my friend Raul and I want to set up a "gypsy" aid station about 4 miles from the finish line of the 100-mile trail run event, (which will still be going on for many hours after we finish the 50). We're going to call it the "Mirage Aid Station." There will be hot soup, food, water, loud music, half-crocked aid station volunteers, and 2 styles of ale on tap. What more could an ultrarunner want at mile 96 of a 100-miler?

As I’ve discussed before, a major reason for this stalemate is ultimately due to how people think about public policy. In reality, neither progressive or conservative ideologies are hegemonic within the American electorate. Instead, public opinion is very much a mix of contradictory and paradoxical tendencies – we want to spend more money on the poor, but are opposed to welfare; we think foreign aid should be cut to a level that’s several times larger than current spending.
There comes that awkward moment when the voices in your head have more personality and attitude than I would ever have. With so much clutter in your head, it pays to just let them out so they can stop bothering you. Story ideas, random thoughts, inner troubles, replaying music, imagined scenarios, and conversations you wished you’ve had, you name it. Just unload them all so you can finally get some peace of mind.
By planning ahead (aka--unplanning and or at least planning to be interrupted), I find I am less apt to be frustrated and not caught off guard when he doesn't stick to his sleep or nap schedule, or when he just is more fussy. Heaven forbid he doesn't work like a machine. He's a human after all with constant changing needs. In this day in age where there is so much parenting information, guides and tell-alls I think we often get trapped that our babies should fit the books we read--forgetting that they are individuals. I know I sometimes think to myself when he doesn't sleep through the night "What the heck? We did our routine, we did everything like we normally do...so why isn't he sleeping like he should?" And then I realize I have bad night. I have nights where I don't sleep well. It's funny how we (can I lump anyone in with me, or should i just say I?) sometimes de-humanize our child and think if we do X and Y then we'll always get Z. But that's not the case, and the sooner we let that go, then the more I think we'll be prepared to deal with their changes in behavior. We can't expect them to be perfect or adhere exactly how we want them to, when we ourselves, don't always stick to schedules and constantly change our minds as well!
Isn’t that what Occupy Wall Street’s been shouting all year?
No. Just no. I do not have faith that the sun will come up tomorrow. I know that it will. I cannot be 100% certain, because again, something could happen, but I still know. I do not have to be 100% certain to know things. If I have to 100% certain to know something, then we just cannot know anything, because we cannot be 100% certain of anything by some people’s definitions certainty. Right now, 2+2=4, but we could find out someday that 2+2=5. However, we all know that this will not happen, but we still cannot be 100% in that either.

The Large Hadron Colllider is, as we all know, a machine intended to destroy the entire universe. Little known is its secondary purpose: to help socially awkward physicists (and aren't they all?) meet hot chicks. Way down the very long line of possible purposes for the LHC is to prove or disprove the existence of a particle called the Higgs boson, supposedly an integral and pervasive component of Life, the Universe and, well, Everything.

During the first decline, from SPX 1422-1357, the declines were steep and the rallies were minimal. After that, for about two weeks, the rallies and declines were mixed. Then after the SPX 1359 low, the rallies were strong and the declines were minimal. After the market hit SPX 1415 on tuesday, however, the market has returned to steep declines and minimal rallies. As long as the rallies remain between 8 and 9 SPX points it looks like we’re in the Intermediate wave C decline. Thus far, the market has dropped to 1394, rallied 9 points, then dropped to 1389. A rally back to SPX 1400 would probably negate this short term scenario.

These words attempt to describe what might be referred to as an aspect of enlightenment. However, because the term ‘enlightenment’ has become loaded, like various other terms within society, it has come to be perceived by many as something almost unattainable, unless complicated and all-consuming practices become the daily routine.

There are seven more learning walks scheduled throughout the academic year and we plan for each teacher to have the opportunity to be a walker and for each class to be visited. As a start, we visited teachers we perceived would be among the most comfortable and selected as walkers those who had eagerly volunteered. With positive feedback from our learning walk pioneers, we hope our faculty will be reassured and enthusiastic. Our aim in implementing learning walks is to support our efforts at nurturing a self-reflective collaborative culture, breaking down the isolation teachers can experience. Learning walks are one important component of our efforts to transform our school into a learning community in which we focus relentlessly on improving student learning and in which we do so together.

"Provisions should be made for as much space and comfort as possible for guests. If the guest bedroom is usually a child's bedroom, some of the surfaces -- certainly the tops of the night table and chest -- should be divested of trappings such as toys, stuffed birds, and baseball mitts. These are precious things, but not all together amusing when a guest is looking for some place to put his own odds and ends."

Holding an offense to eight first downs and 183 total yards is damn impressive, even if it was against a clearly outmatched Ole Miss team. And the fact that we accomplished such a feat down two important starters in the defensive front seven gives me much hope for both the immediate and long term futures of our team.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt butter and chocolate chips. Stir constantly and remove from heat when chips are fully melted. In the same pot, blend in the sugar. Then add eggs, blending fully one at a time. Add flour and salt and beat until air bubbles form in the batter. Pour into a greased 9 X 13-inch pan. Bake for 20 minutes. Turn heat down to 325 degrees and bake for 10 more minutes.

If you read the poem to a large group of people and ask them which road would they choose, I guarantee than over 90 per cent will choose the less travelled one. Hmmm! How can it be less travelled so?

In front of my eyes, the branches of the banyan touch the water of Nabogonga.The water submerges the vegetation on its banks. The clear dawn peeks in through the slit in the bamboo fence. I hear the doel bird – cheeik, cheeik. Seeing my shutting up, my son thinks that he has hurt me, tried to say something to console me. By then, I see the swaying boats tied up at the jetty by the temple. I see the shadow of the pakur tree in the water. The small bamboo bridge. In the middle of the Naboganga, an eddy whirls up. I feel it, my homeland hasnt left me – it is living on embracing this thin, worn out body of mine.

Maybe I have been guilty of this, and if so I apologise. Not for bullying but for insulting you with a low form of wit. You deserve more. You deserve a well crafted and structured joke. Beer snobbery like all forms of snobbery is intrinsically ridiculous and snobbery has a long history of being ridiculed. From the wonderful “Keeping up Appearances” to “Dad’s Army”, the self set up of the snob via their own conceits followed by their downfall as reality bites has been a comedy narrative with origins that predate television or even the music hall. You dear reader deserve something of that calibre and rest assured I am busy working on it.

Furthermore, why the secrecy surrounding the release of his other records? Passport records, school records, and so on? Why has he spent so much money fighting their release? Ridicule if you must, Obama would not pass any background investigation we would perform for a position on any board of directors of a Fortune 100 company in light of what little he has personally provided, along with his refusal to turn over other records related to his past. Yet, he sits in the White House at such a precipitous time in our history. His placement there was no accident, and his election was not some serendipitous event in U.S. history.

As a Christian viewer, you would like to believe that there is some sort of healing in this confession. Protestants might reject the ‘catholic’ nature of the confession, and decry the fact that the priest does not offer grace freely – that he expects something from Corleone. But surely it is right that confession without change (without repentence) accomplishes nothing. Too often we pedal what Dietrich Bonhoeffer calls ‘cheap grace’ – grace without price. But while redemption is freely and graciously available to all, it has to be appropriated, as Bonhoeffer goes on to note, grace is costly – what cost God the life of the son cannot be cheap for us. Likewise, notwithstanding his confession, Corleone fails to repent – to change, and so he misses out on the redemption that is in fact available to him.

Comparing a defence of your children and communities with terrorism shows the corrupt minds of establishment propagandists like Anna Turley, author of the report.

Seems to be a bit like that at the moment, not really sure what flipping day it is. I'm definitely sleeping well at the moment for one thing - Mrs F was out on a works girlie night out at the cinema to see the Hotel one with Maggie Smith, Judi Dench et al in it. I was in bed when she came home, I remember her talking to me, can't say I responded well, if at all, since I was already out for the count and then for the second day running the alarm really does wake me from my slumber, often I'm awake and dozing for the hour before it goes off. Not recently. Usual routine of up, make pot of tea, eat corn flakes, have a wash, get dressed, walk to station. Only once I'm on the station do I start to sort of wake up and I'm stood there today thinking "It is Thursday isn't it?"

Our hotel shone with marbled floors, manicured lawns, numerous swimming pools and was filled with approximately 1500 friendly, hard-working employees who greeted us with “hola” and a hand over their heart. It was a far cry from our motel at Chichen Itza years ago where we were just happy to have air conditioning. This was also my first “all inclusive” experience and I could get used to ordering freely from the menu and not having to calculate tips after every meal. The choices were international with many fusion dishes but the portions small. If you were still hungry, just order another course - which was true of the weak drinks they served.

I like a wide range of films. I love disaster films like Towering Inferno or Day After Tomorrow; I love the Watchmen for a thousand reasons. I like action films almost without reservation, and the transformation of special effects provided by CGI is so far from my childhood film experience that I am extremely hard to disappoint. But the thing I like about the new super-hero movies – Fantastic Four, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Avengers (etc.) – is that they aren’t gloomy walks through the depths of pathos, an angst-ridden journey through it’s-hard-to-be-a-hero, or a bleak look at the worst of humanity. They’re quite the opposite.

The sky stays blue - it's a day to spend in the garden. Over in Badnage Wood there's a lot of bird activity. A Jay squawks occasionally, a couple or three Buzzards soar over the trees mewing to each other. Then Ravens, big and black as night fly up out of the conifers, their cries metallic barking 'gronks'. They roll and tumble acrobatically in the sky; dropping, twisting and rising in unison. Such a joyous display - such dancing partners.
All are smoking. Two are talking to each other with the precise clipped tones of Beijing Mandarin (it's hard to tell if the words are friendly or not); the others are standing alone, looking away, looking for the taxis that E@L couldn't find either. They appear hard, arms folded across their chests; harsh; they look older in the streetlight than they will; dim lights and alcohol will make them appear gorgeous in the early hours in the Japanese karaoke bars (they speak fluent Japanese, can drink sake and Chivas and sperm till the sun comes up) or in the dim black-light glow downstairs in Brix (at The Hyatt). Mainly they stand apart, they see enough of each other thanks, sleeping six to a room.

That evening we find Jonah Hex in clown makeup watching the crowd, looking for the thugs threatening the show. He also notices Carolee and Starbuck doing some heavy duty lip locks behind the scenes.

Jonah ends up diving into a barrel and having a bull knock him around the arena for awhile.

Now back to the topic. My thesis. I know I must complete it, no matter what. There are some issues that I need to sort out like getting Yoda's feedback and doing more reading on the literature. That's not a problem. I think the thing that stops me from getting ahead is myself, particularly my lack of focus and consistency. If I can just snap out of this self-made rut, I should be fine. At the end of the day, it's not the mountain I need to conquer, it's myself.
I missed the next bit as our next courses arrived, giving The Husband and I the opportunity to entertain ourselves by trying to figure out where on the plate the chef had hidden a vegetable concoction exotically described on the menu as “broccoli mousse” (turned out he’d forgotten it.

Interestingly enough, "The Merrill Company" (the phony company Gross is accused of using to steal money) existed well before 2006, when Gross allegedly met the victim he is accused of defrauding. The 2002 press release about Delmont-Ross linked in above provided an address and phone number for "Merrill Lynch Trust Department," one of the contest's supposed sponsors--but when I called the number as part of Ann's and my investigation, the woman who answered told me that I'd reached "The Merrill Company," not Merrill Lynch, and hung up on me when I tried to find out more. Checking business records, I was entirely unsurprised to discover that The Merrill Company was a business registered in January 2002 by Mitchell Gross in Cobb County, Georgia.

Sometimes you'll find the patchwork stores have better pricing on batting as they use Australian batting whereas Spotlight stocks batting from the US which costs more (about $19-$24 a metre). If you're just starting out you can find polyester batting but I really like natural batting when it comes to making quilts. It's washes and dries well and your quilt becomes softer over time.
The Passion behind Breakin’ Out – Sharon’s Story
I started the race next to Iain, from The Running Spot, who was the 9:55 pace leader. (There was no one representing 10:00 minute miles.) I was running comfortably with that group until I broke away, about a mile in, to use the port-a-potty. The wait was much longer than I would have liked. As I stood in line, I watched Iain run off into the distance. And I saw the 10:15 pace leader run by. Then the 10:33 pack passed me. When I finally finished my turn, two minutes had gone by and the 9:55 group was not in sight.
From The Warlord*:
I love technology but I’ve become aware of how multi-tasking it seems to be now. While on one hand this is great, on the other hand, focussing can become split between several tasks at once on too regular a basis. Think about the internet. At one time if you wanted to know something, you had to read a book or to ask someone. You might have got back a few sources of information and then had time to think about it. Now, you can google it and get millions of varying answers back in seconds. While this is useful, the immediacy seems to draw away from reflection in that its such a fast process. Try limiting the search engine process except when in need of quick answers.
Bear Republic is best known for their Racer 5 IPA, the classic West Coast IPA where the hops dominate with the malt mostly an after thought. But go to the brewpub, and you'll get a much different appreciation for Bear Republic, where believe or not, the malt often takes center stage.
I returned Sunday night to a partially bare ceiling, light fixture dangling and debris cover every inch of my room. Plaster dust and chunks of plaster covered my floor and furniture. Pam had already called me to warn me. When I got home I just laughed and cleaned it up. Thankfully only two plastic bins and my stereo were broken from the downpour of plaster.

In Iraq, Jewish history and Hebrew language instruction were prohibited in Jewish schools during the 1920s. Jews were expelled from public service and education in the 1930s. The Jewish schools' curricula were censored in 1932.

With that in mind - here are my goals from May on...
You are beautiful. I put this first not because it’s the most notable thing about you, or because it’s the most important, but because women (yes, all women) have a tendency to wonder about this throughout their lives. People stop me all the time to admire you and tell me just how lovely you are.

“No, I’m sure I can reason with him.” Jolie was not really sure if she could reason with him, she would probably end up yelling at the man, but she was going to try to be civil. She just hoped she could get him to understand that it was not fair to make her grandmother pay for her grandfather’s crime.
Widely regarded as playwright Brian Friel’s masterpiece, Dancing at Lughnasa is a memory play about five unmarried sisters eking out their lives in a small Irish village. Quotidian Theatre Company’s production of this drama runs through May 20.
“Who the hell has a key to my house?” Ann barked.
Or perhaps I'm wrong; they do worship, but not so much a Christian God as the way an exotic Nature has clothed in spectacular garb, every season, what would be a quite ordinary little church. The Virginia Creeper covers it in shades of green in the spring and summer, and in autumn especially it becomes a mecca for photographers as the greens give way to multicolour hues of pink, red and purple. Autumn is when it's at the height of its charm.
Made some great memories with her and her kids in the short time they were here
3. When potatoes and carrots are done, drain in a colander then return to hot pot. Add in onions and garlic, a good couple knobs of earth balance, a drizzle of soymilk, a few pinches of nutmeg, and of course salt and pepper. Mash together with a masher until fairly blended. Taste, and adjust seasoning to taste. (I usually end up using more soymilk and butter after the initial mashing.)
When I got home, I knew I had to replicate this sandwich but I needed to make two big changes: 1) I needed to Veganize it and 2) I needed to Weight Watcherize it. So I switched out a lot of ingredients and added many more vegetables. The results were soooo good that the dish has become a regular for us. Sometimes we eat it on bread, usually ciabatta, but when I’m trying to cut carbs and calories, we eat it sans bread with salad. I don’t have a grill so I sauté the mushrooms and make this a one-pot dish. I even love feta cheese now, Vegan of course, made by Sunergia (which you can buy online).
At first, I was kind of tongue tied, like, “Yeah, I guess that was pretty foolish, I teach pitching, so why would I want to know how to train people for functional strength?” And, to be honest, I continued to think about this most of Saturday, trying to justify why I just did that. As I came to my contemplative answer, I realized the very exact same reason I am working with Eric at all, is why I’m watching these DVDs on Friday night.
I think these will add a touch of elegance to any gift. I hope you like them.
So even though on Monday I complained about how I’m struggling to juggle all the stuff in my life, I wrote that post on Thursday.

My thoughts turned to nature study. We had stopped keeping our nature notebooks up to date a couple of years ago. Moving house, renovations and our work with our church and home study filled our days now, and taking the time with our nature journals had been crowded out. We still went for walks and observed a great number of nature wonders. We still enjoyed picnics, and swimming at the beach. We went on many camping and kayaking adventures. And simply being out-of-doors watching, noticing and sharing what we saw with each other still kept us in touch with thinking, and wondering and observing. In some ways I guess you could call it filling up the nature notebook in our heads with memories.
On the altar of game balance, those flavor elements have been fairly neutralized but in exchange, the wizards have become nothing more than fighters that don't use a sword to attack people but rather use spells that do similar damage and have similar effects.
One of the brashest challenges that religious truth has experienced over the past several decades is the remarkable rise of the pugnacious New Atheists. Sean McDowell and Jonathan Marrow, new generation Christian apologists, have undertaken the task of contesting this anti-theistic upsurge. And in Is God Just a Human Invention? And Seventeen Other Questions Raised by the New Atheists the authors have pulled together a wide range of research that powerfully critiques the arguments from the combative non-theists.
“I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. I have the audacity to believe that people everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits. I believe that what self-centered people have torn down, people other-centered can build. I still believe we shall overcome.”
“Whether the north pole of the Sun has north or south polarity decides the entry point of galactic cosmic rays into the heliosphere,” Gopalswamy told TPM.
This vehicle was earning a citation. When I was walking up to the vehicle I was not planning on writing them a ticket. I’m looking for dope and weapons. Once at the window they had everything going for them. They were teachers at a local school. They were older people probably coming home from a high school event. They lived in the area that was not drug ridden.
7. Put the lug nuts back onto the wheel in a star pattern. Tighten them as much as you can with your fingers.
The smell of an oil burning stove takes me back to family holidays as a child on the lovely Bessiestown Farm, though I am not quite sure why. I was once walking through the streets of Montreuil, a very built up suburb of Paris, and this smell took me as I was walking to this beautiful farm out in the sticks in Northumberland.
so, thanks, you two! :)
For journalists of all types, that means we can gather news, write an article or blog post, edit it and put a headline on it without fear of going to prison. There are limits — we can’t commit libel, for example, without legal consequences. Even so, journalists enjoy freedoms in this country that their counterparts in others do not.
So far, even a mere mention of the following names in the blogs’ entries has resulted in those posts receiving up to 100 times fewer hits than the average entries do on the respective blogs.
2. Put beans in crockpot and cover with about 3 inches if water, let soak overnight.
Put water in a pot and bring to a boil. Add tapioca (ubi kayu) leaves and soda bicarbonate. Boil until the leaves turned dark green. Drain away excess water and serve with sambal (chilly).
Of course because mine were mini tarts and we had leftover custard so I decided to make bread and butter pudding with the remains. Not just any bread and butter pudding mind you - choc chip hot cross bun bread and butter pudding!
Righto so lets start from the beginning. I use to work near Ravenswood (another mining town) and travel the backroads home for a shorter trip. I seen this little sign reading “White Blow – 1km” and passed it for a few months until curiousity got the better of me and I had to see the cocaine manufacturing plant.
2. The first sentence sets the tone and the mood by highlighting what Harry Potter has not done in this world the author is creating (which is a nice introduction to Rowling’s world building by the way). Same with the second sentence.
And if we’re missing the point, our acts of worship are hollow and meaningless; they’re an offense to the one who instituted them, because our words say “I’m following Jesus,” while our lives say “Jesus who?”
But nowadays, every blowhole of a 15-year old thinks they have the answer to everything from healthcare reform to global warming to the pitching needs of the New York Yankees. And all based on their extensive experience sitting in their parent’s basement watching Scooby Doo Cartons, Ashton Kutcher movies and stuffing their mouths with Ding-Dongs, Skittles and Baby Ruth candy bars.
But I’m not sure I’ll make a beeline for the door this time when they open. Nor will those friends I mentioned.
All other rules of the road (i.e., lane markings, turning from an appropriate lane, distance between cars) are merely suggestions that drivers in Lima are free to adhere to or ignore as their whim allows.
We arranged to meet my grandmother, at a motel she knew to be nice, that night. It felt like we'd come full circle, when we arrived there. It was the same little town where we'd first stopped to walk on the beach nearly a week before.

Soon, the voice will offer me a choice of languages. The only one I’m really interested in is human, but that’s never available. I’m barely over my disappointment when it becomes necessary for me to punch in a bunch of numbers that will tell the voice that I am allowed access to customer service land. Even if I do manage to push all the right buttons for account numbers, pin numbers, code words and zip codes, I’m not out of the hot water. The computer voice immediately becomes a detective!!!
A group of some good friends and I used to go geocaching quite religiously. When I would try to explain the object of geocaching to others - to follow coordinates to a specific location where others have hidden “treasure” (aka, usually a pill bottle with a log in it where you sign your name to prove you found the cache) and then keep an online profile recording all your finds – I always felt a little lame. Usually I would finish my increasingly polished spiel, and the person would squint their eyes a little and ask, “So, what’s the point?” I guess it’s one of those things that sounds stupider than it actually is. But geocaching makes perfect sense if it’s true that we like to look for things and find them, especially when they have some kind of value to us.

It was really refreshing to hear someone who “just doesn’t care about the technology” but cares about the reaching talk about how the flipping lecture idea could work in reality.

CAFE CHARLOT / LE PROGRES - because I love me some French hipsters.
The duality of his father helped Cross get an early understanding of the complexities of human nature, which later strongly came through in the protagonists and other characters of his novels. Throughout his seven books, including the Booker long-listed ALWAYS THE SUN, and his latest release BURIAL, bleak yet menacing settings are populated with characters neither starkly good nor evil, but smudged shades of grey.

Instead, I cried because I felt so much more pressure knowing I’d have a daughter. I had assumed that my husband would be primarily responsible for teaching him how to pee in the potty and for having “the talk” around puberty.
It's that kind of a random day...
Among the many finer points of Shark Attack 3: Megalodon are: prehistoric shark managing to always look utterly and convincingly real and not in the least like stock footage of a normal shark with things added that are smaller than they really are. John Barrowman, just generally, but in this instance as a lady loving, jet skiing playboy who can hunt supposedly extinct giant sharks, still crack wise and get lucky while doing it. It turns out that megalodons are perfectly able to subsist on a steady diet of boats seasoned with a little sailor and/or diver. I won’t hear a word said against this movie, it’s probably one the greatest motion picture extravaganzas ever. I’m going to put my fingers in my ears now and go la la la la la very loudly.
As the events at the Copenhagen summit on climate change continue to unfold this week, I think it is important that we look at the relationship between climate change and microfinance.
In June 2011 I came to Britain to begin a speaking tour to draw attention to the plight of my people, the Palestinian citizens of Israel. The tour was meant to last 10 days. Instead I had to stay for 10 months in order to resist an attempt by the home secretary, Theresa May, to deport me – itself the result of a smear campaign against me and what I represent. I fought not just for my own sake, but for all who are smeared because they support the Palestinian cause.
However, as you must have realised by now, the ideologues who run our country are not rational.
There is also another aspect of these numbers which is the fact that these are list prices for schools and many students pay far below the list price. Colleges are perhaps the worlds ore effective price discriminators: charging different prices to different students based on their incomes. This is a good thing if the goal is to increase college graduates for economic theory shows that, generally, quantities increase with price discrimination. If colleges and universities are just practicing more price discrimination than these numbers aren't nearly as worrying as the would otherwise be.

Next, we call on Saturn, Uranus and Neptun the cold, remote wastes of the solar system. The atmospheres of these giant ‘ planets are known to contain hydrogen, marsh gas, helium, ammonia (on Saturn) and no oxygen at all. Such an atmosphere is poisonous to Earth men.
Brown’s hero is retired Air Force Lt.-Col. Patrick McLanahan, featured previously in multiple books that follow his career. Along with McLanahan’s son, Brad, and a roster of volunteers, they rise to the occasion of unearthing a major double-cross, leading to the President’s decision to send American-manned robots to aid the CAP crew, and a huge aircraft called the Skytrain: “Thanks to its advanced engines and mission-adaptive wing technology, with which tiny computer-controlled micro-acuators could make almost the entire fuselage and wing skin a lift or drag device, the huge aircraft could fly close to the speed of sound at gross weight, as well as half as slow as any other aircraft of its size.”
There line much starvation to Chishawasha and the people went to other countries to buy It, The next year the rain came and they got plenty of food. At that time there came in people from Nhohwe to the village of Mashonganyika. They were of the house of Nemukuyu, the sub-chief of Chief Mangwende. Their names were Kusangaya, Sigondi, I Ii, mmnke, Mujuru, Dzedze and Tsuro. They lived in the country of Rusike. They went by night to Mangwende’s kraal and stole cattle, Mangwende sent his warriors to kill them. The leader of Mangwende’s army was his own son called Chirowodza. When the army of Mangwende arrived at Garo kraal they started fighting with the sons of Garo during the night. In the army of Mangwende among the killed were: Muzungu, Nechiridzi and misamba. The army of Mangwende was defeated by the sons of Garo (his mutupo was
Time flies by in rapid style
note on age: There isn't any sex or bad language, but the plot is achingly intense at times, the themes are for older readers, and there's some violence. Though the girl with wings on the cover might suggest a fairy story, it isn't, so I wouldn't give this to a pre-teen reader. On the other hand, it would be a good crossover to adults who shy away from YA books. Fans of Margaret Atwood, for instance, might enjoy it. That being said, my husband looked at the wings when I pressed him to read it and did not immediately pounce on the book.
I am a country ham kind of girl at Christmas time, that is my family's tradition. My Dad and Mom baby a country ham soaking it, brining it, soaking it, etc., etc., etc. I still have yet to this day to be brave enough to attempt the process myself, because if you don't take care of a country ham just right, it well, just tastes like you licked a salt block!
I often walk into town of an evening if I'm planning on having a glass of wine. Its a pleasant (if sweaty) 40 minute stroll past the flowering laburnum trees, a couple of chattering roadside markets and a simple and dignified pagoda.

“We lost to a lot of teams that we were supposed to win against and at some point somebody’s gotta get angry about that,” Pelage said.
It was of course no longer the stomach flu but the first bout with Chrones that my son was experiencing. He would lay on the floor crying, writhing in pain from the cramps he experienced. I didn’t know what to do! But as the days progressed I decided I couldn’t follow the hospitals advice of “make sure he stays hydrated and he’ll be fine” because the boy couldn’t keep down water. Almost 10 pounds and two weeks later I carried my son out to the ambulance that arrived to drive us an hour away to the children’s hospital.

I attached the molding with the Crafter's Pick Ultimate glue and drops of gel super glue every 4 or 5 inches. I applied glue to the top part of the molding (glued to ceiling) and the back of molding (glued to wall). I pressed each piece in place for about 30 seconds. Again, the super glue held them in place while the Ultimate glue dried.
Something is not right here.
That soundtrack saved me. I spent hours and hours playing and rewinding the tape in the upstairs sitting room in my grandparents’ house. I had adopted the space as my “office” since no one ever went in there and it was quiet. I’d figured that a good way to kill time was to type all the lyrics out on an old typewriter.

Lyra McCauley is a writer and loves fantasy novels, but until she opens a selection from bookstore owner Cullen Drake, she has no idea he’s a wizard character who lives a double life inside that volume…or the story’s magic will compel her from the edge of depression to adventure, danger, and love.

In the “olden days” the big way of getting films seen were festivals – most of which were in town halls, coffee shops and if you were lucky flea ridden, coke stained, half empty cinemas. But for those of you that have ever dreamed of making a movie. Those options were enough… getting your little film seen was a bonus.
Is it a surprise that three-quarters of Americans willing to take polls support laws requiring voters to show ID at the polls? I don’t get the sense that Gallup is talking to a lot of illegal immigrants here.
But often we want not only to represent objects, but to represent our reasoning. For this purpose, CmapTools is terrific. Here is a screen shot, from a poorly resolved argument about why seed size in Eucalypt trees might be bigger in species that are shorter. Now there are some pretty big holes in this argument. But I hope you get the sense that the links (arcs) between nodes constitutes testable propositions, that may be supported with data.

I would say that GQ ranks the importance of social media fairly high. We’ve got a brilliant web team and even a magazine side that are savvy, if not active in the digital space. We’re making massive pushes toward having more content, so my joining the team gave them the opportunity to focus more on their individual jobs as writers, editors, producers, etc. while I focus specifically on the social media side, while writing and contributing when I can as well.

After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here am I.” He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.” So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar. Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again to you.” And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together. (Genesis 22:1-6)
The way it seemed the fact of her beauty had never occurred to her and made her so much more beautiful…And I wanted it.

I work on the principle that a working day deteriorates and by and large aim to think, dream, write, revise from about 8.30 or 9.00 until 1.30 or 2.00. How on earth author wives and mothers who often have to fit in so much bitty-piecy work in and around the home, are able to write as well, fills me with astonishment and admiration. My powers of concentration are considerable, but for me it’s a matter of momentum, and I doubt whether I could write in a pick-it-up and put-it-down sort of way.

So there once was a time, early on in my career, when I offered representation to an author and I didn’t really have any good references in that genre to provide. I actually don’t even remember who the client was anymore, but I do remember that she said oh that’s ok, I spoke to a friend of mine who met you at a conference and she said you were fabulous, and also that you were tiny (I included the tiny part so you would know I’m not making this up, even though the fabulous part totally sounds like something I would say about myself).

Consequently, employee workplace experience is going to matter even more than it does now .Sales staff increasingly access more knowledge about products and services through smartphones – supported by videos and digital demonstrations. There have been some impressive developments in the use of online learning solutions and virtual reality technology in corporate training, especially useful for global organizations and those who have a high proportion of remote workers. And gamification is rapidly gaining more air time as an involvement-driven engagement phenomenon.

‘Softpack‘ (this is really the best thing ever, but it’s hard to describe. Thankfully, I found a photo of it! You get naked on a special bed covered in plastic and an attendant covers you in stuff, which could be mud or something fragrant of that consistency. Then you lay down and get covered by the plastic, which is warm. Then it inflates and you’re floating for upwards of 30 minutes in a warm mud bath while something like yoga music plays in the room. The room is dark and the attendant leaves you. You can fall asleep, and I have. I’ve also meditated. It is the closest thing I’ve ever experienced to being in a womb, minus that whole ‘breathing fluids’ part). It’s a treatment that’s available at our local spas, and it’s by far my favorite thing to do. I’m not sure if this is available in American spas, as I’ve never gone to a spa in the US… but if it’s not, then I’d definitely recommend it for when you happen to travel to Germany!
The other six posting lists were: critic/teacher Henri Agel, film director and theorist Alexander Astruc, novelist/playwright Jacques Audiberti, producer Pierre Braunberger, critic and future director Ado Kyrou, critic Claude Mauriac, and director Alain Resnais. Once again, Jacques Audiberti was the only participant born in the 19th Century, but this year Pierre Braunberger joined in the the 50-something category. Claude Mauriac and Henri Agel were the only 40-somethings.
Hip hop accessories have gone through a revolutionary expansion from customary items such as bling bling jewelry, throw back jerseys and fitted caps.

OK, I’ll start. Today sees the end of Amazon’s Sunshine Deals summer reading extravaganza, and for many indie authors it can’t come a day too soon. The effect on those of us tenuously in the top 100 has been devastating. Sales have tanked (from around 120 a day to 40 a day in my case) as ultra-cheap books by established authors have demonstrated that readers’ love of all things indie actually referred to price not content. And they’ll be with us for a while to come now they’ve worked into the recommendation algorithm.
By the way, having now seen the film The Avengers, I like Hawkeye's recent redesign even less. The costume seems like a compromise between something comic book Hawkeye and Jeremy Renner's movie Hawkeye would wear, but from the neck up Hawkeye looks like Smallville Green Arrow, with a fuller head of hair than Renner's military cut, and with Cyclops-like sci-fi style sunglasses apparently embedded in his face. Maybe it will grown on me. It's not like it's the worst superhero costume redesign I've seen in the past few months or anything.

Just goes to show I need to make more time for coloring!! LOL
Quarter the potatoes lengthwise and thinly slice. Grate the carrots. Melt the butter in a soup pot and add the potatoes, carrots, onion, and bay leaves. Cook over medium heat 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Raise the heat, add the wine, and let it reduce until syrupy. Add 1 1/2 cups of the parsley, 1 1/2 tsp salt, and the water, bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, partially covered, until the potatoes have broken apart, about 30 minutes. Stir in the cream and remaining parsley and heat through. Taste for salt and season with pepper. Remove the bay leaves and serve.
This is supposed to be a comforting story for kids who had to part with their toys but it didn’t comfort me. I even hated that story. I had a favorite stuffed toy named Teddy Buzzy Bear Cruz. After reading the story, I thought, I don’t not care if Teddy becomes a real bear, I’ll still cry if he’s taken away from me. I was so mad at the boy’s parents. If only they told him that they’ll throw away his toy if he kept it by his side while he was sick, then he wouldn’t have done so. He would have parted with his toy while he was sick, and the toy wouldn’t get his germs, and he would have been able to keep his toy.
All of the things I so longed for, never came.

Whoever came up with that bullshit couldn’t be more wrong. Call ED’s a strive for perfection. Call them a coping method. You can even go so far to say that we just want attention (another false accusation, if I may add). I don’t care. Call them what you want, but it has absolutely nothing to do with feeling in control.

We will be spilling-over with the good things of God. We won’t be visitors; we will be Victors. We will receive His trophy. We will take turns calling, singing, shouting and laughing. Can you hear Him? Come and Worship.
1/4 tsp. salt, pepper to taste
Ugh, Ikea. Why is it so hard for you to create something that is true white and not your crappy cream/beige/offwhite shade? The frames look a lot worse in person than this picture shows. They might as well be yellow against white walls.

Begin by looking inside, by taking responsibility for yourself, for your own feelings, your own actions.
