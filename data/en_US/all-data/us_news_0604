That's not to say the filibuster can't be abused. It often is when used to block votes on presidential appointments. One idea for reform is to require an up-or-down vote on a White House nomination within 90 days or have it confirmed by default. That makes a lot of sense - up to a point.
In 1912, Ohioans preferred Democratic challenger Woodrow Wilson to GOP incumbent William Howard Taft, though Taft himself was an Ohioan.

Lancelott Keith is taking a break when Marla Gibbs arrives with trays of catered food from her supper club, Memory Lane, to feed the crew of about fifty and growing who have gathered here with their brooms, rubber gloves and rakes. They've come from around the corner and across town, dispatched by radio DJs, ministers, their own consciences. 'Problem with the young men is that they have no work', says Keith. 'No jobs. Those are the things that make you feel worthwhile. Even pushing a broom. There's been a void for too long. People have to have a purpose.'

Where we ate — After hours of shopping we headed to the beach at The Back Porch Seafood and Oyster House, just west of Henderson Beach State Park. The heavy rain changed to a hard sprinkle, so we decided to rent two beach chairs ($25 a day for two). We toughed it out, covering ourselves with beach towels to soak up the raindrops, sipped tropical drinks and ate crab and spinach dip with nachos from the restaurant. You name it, the restaurant had it: soups, salads, fish, pastas and even chicken tenders and popcorn shrimp for the little ones. One evening, we pulled into Hog's Breath Saloon and Cafe for a quick drink and appetizer. After 30 minutes of sniffing the fabulous barbecue and smoked meat scent, we gave in and ordered a full rack of smoked loin back ribs. Hog's Breath was well worth a stop for a mouth-watering dinner. One evening, we ventured next door to Marina Cafe and ordered the gulf shrimp linguine and the pan seared yellowedge grouper with jumbo lump crab. Windows line the back of the restaurant, which gives the interior an open feeling, and we had a fabulous view of the Harbor, even on a rainy evening. For breakfast, we tried the free continental breakfast from our hotel and stopped at The Donut Hole for brunch another morning. I ordered the big breakfast sandwich, and Megan opted for the western omelette. The homemade doughnuts looked amazing, but we skipped the extra calories.
In adopting poverty and low-wage work as his themes, Edwards has struck a far more combative, populist tone than in his 2004 presidential campaign. And that has helped him elbow into the top tier of a field dominated by better-financed candidates Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) and Barack Obama (D-Ill.) -- and has even boosted him to a lead in polls in the key early-voting state of Iowa.

2008 Columbia Winery "Cellarmaster's" Riesling, Columbia Valley, Washington ($8.99) - This wine is a step up in seriousness and complexity. It still has the low alcohol, with a hint of residual sugar and tartness, and the bonus of being a solidly made Washington Riesling. The Germans could not touch this wine for price-to-quality. The color is pale yellow. The aroma has muted but soft lush fruit. The taste has a great balance of pear and apple tartness with the hint of sweet that comes with it. There is a touch of mineral on the finish. 89 points.

I love my neighborhood. Joan and I call it Shangri-La. It looks like a TV commercial for diversity when all the kids are out in the summer.

Second place went to R.W. Knudsen Sparkling Cranberry ($3.19 for 25.4 ounces, Rainbow), one of two products from this manufacturer. This was the Champagne-style bottle, which calls itself a "juice-flavored beverage from concentrates."

So, conserving state budget money was in fact part of what led to SB 5. Agreed, the bill may be a blunderbuss when a Derringer would have done. Agreed, too, that by potentially limiting unions' political power, SB 5 -- to GOP insiders -- is a neat "two-fer." But the issue is spending -- or would be, if Republicans hadn't let their enemies define the debate.

Tragically, tens of thousands of people commit suicide in this country every year and, believe it or not, most of them have never played a down of football.

Lori proved a striding encyclopedia of wildflowers, pointing out more than we'd imagined possible, along with tidbits like learning how to identify mushrooms or that mashing up some yarrow will help stop bleeding. As we crisscrossed the now-verdant ski runs, we discussed mining practices, water rights issues, the mindset of a skier attempting a run down the Devil's Crotch, and why the magnificent mountains merit names no more colorful than Peaks 7, 8, 9 and 10. Turns out they're part of the Tenmile Range.

The Ravens have a bunch of young offensive linemen already on the roster, and they’re not afraid to take on projects at the position.

Waititi made 2007's eccentric love tale, Eagle vs. Shark, and like his debut feature this one incorporates purposefully primitive animated sequences and loads of (retro) pop-cult references. If the filmmaker relies too much on the deadpan and the arch, Boy is balanced out by Rolleston's smart, soulful performance.
In a speech closely watched by investors, Bernanke said the Fed will consider a range of steps at its Sept. 20-21 meeting, but he offered no specific plans. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 100 points shortly after Bernanke's remarks began at 1:30 p.m. Eastern.

• The addition of center Dan Gadzuric raised concerns about Jared Jeffries' sore right knee, explained Tim Rohan of the Times' "Off the Dribble" blog: "Woodson said the move was precautionary in case Jared Jeffries’s sore right knee doesn’t respond to the rest Woodson now can afford to give him. Jeffries sat out a second straight game Friday due to the knee... 'It’s not like anything different,' Jeffries said. 'It’s just wear and tear; my knee swells up.

Gingrich, 68, spent 20 years in the House, the last four as speaker after leading the Republican resurgence of 1994. He left Congress in 1998 under an ethics cloud, following sharp clashes with GOP colleagues. He then earned millions of dollars as a Washington-based consultant, speaker and writer. Like Romney, Gingrich has changed positions on some issues, including how to address climate change.

But a book is not a piece of short-form journalism. The book I envisioned would be 70,000 words. I was not sure where 65,000 of them would come from until I had an epiphany. What happened in that split second on the football field that day so long ago at Plymouth-Whitemarsh had not just shattered the still-unlived life of Buddy Miley. It had changed the lives of countless others: Jimmy; his parents, Rosemarie and Bert; and the other adult Miley children — Bob, Joanne, Rose, Patti and Linda. Friends Buddy had played ball with as a youth found that their lives were no longer the same. And there was a woman in Alabama who had befriended Buddy — Karen Kollmeyer (then Karen Shields).

The museum's inaugural show takes visitors from the late 1800s to about 2000. "There are these individuals, the greatest players to swing a bat you have never heard of. We have an opportunity to share their seldom-told stories. There were a lot of barn-storming brothers and a couple women out there who had played all over this state and the Midwest. John Donaldson, the best left-handed pitcher, probably a better pitcher than Satchel Paige but because of segregation of the major and minor leagues, there were only a handful of African-Americans able to make it during those times. The other exciting part of that is that baseball teams, the Keystones and the St. Paul Colored Gophers, were actually owned by African-American entrepreneurs. This was their business. They hired from within the community. This was the thing to do on Sunday afternoon. This whole baseball movement was a precursor to Civil Rights. It's a huge story."

•That Cahun used only her own body to make wondrously surrealist images, never objectifying the bodies of others, or of women generally. This distinguishes her mightily from the French surrealists in the circle of Andre Breton, with whom she allied herself. When Man Ray, Andre Kertesz or Hans Bellmer made the kind of distorted, dizzying photographs to which Cahun's work has sometimes been compared, they used female models and often rendered them headless. Cahun kept her head, except in a wry double-exposure that gives sentient limbs to a pair of blocky boulders. She never projected her traumas or desires onto another. Nevertheless, when her work was rediscovered in the mid-'80s and exhibited in a major exhibition of surrealist photography, it was mistaken for the work of a male artist named Claude Cahun, rather than the work of a female artist using a male pseudonym to challenge such presumptions.

Hey, Rick: I suppose you can analyze the situations frame by frame and cite several areas in which Mangini was quite good. I would agree with that. You can also cite specific games -- or specific parts of games -- in which his Browns functioned exceptionally well. You can also weigh the strength of the schedules he played against and measure the quality of his rosters. Ultimately, head coaches are judged on their record and 10-22 was simply not good enough. His two Browns teams were unspectacular, inconsistent and old. I don't think I'm breaking new ground here.

Gingrich, who has a Ph.D. and who has authored or co-authored 21 books, clearly does not see himself as a regular guy.

It's like the old Mort Sahl line about Richard Nixon: "He was born in a log cabin in Whittier, Calif., wearing a blue suit."
"The feds offered no significant increase in outright funding," Drewniak said. LaHood had offered more loans, which Christie refused, and lined up a slate of private companies that would join the project and shoulder some of the extra costs.

Two things Mr. Obama said this week clearly weren't true. First, he suggested that it would be "unprecedented" for the court to overturn a federal law.

Yet even if the movie surpasses expectations, it is tough to justify such a sharp increase in valuation. Generously assuming the movie takes $300 million at the domestic box office and $300 million overseas, Lions Gate would collect roughly half of the total. If it incurs about $200 million in production and marketing costs, the company would earn roughly $100 million. Success in home video, television and toys could yield another $200 million. If the streak lasts for all four movies, profits could total $1.2 billion, or about $800 million after taxes.

Earlier this season, in a game between the New Orleans Hornets and Los Angeles Clippers, Griffin, one of the games most spectacular dunkers, caught a pass near the top of the 3-point line and was sprinting toward the rim with 4:06 left in the fourth quarter. He never got airborne. Smith lowered his shoulder into Griffin, sending the Clippers star sprawling. Griffin remained down for about 30 seconds, then was clearly groggy when he got to his feet. Smith walked through a courtside seating area to avoid three Clippers who confronted him moments after the hit, then raised his arm to acknowledge cheers from the crowd.

Do you understand what a cataract is? Right behind the eye's pupil is the eye's lens, an oval, clear structure that focuses incoming light onto the retina, the layer of cells at the back of the eye that transmits images to the brain.

A dense smudge blocks out incoming light and blurs the visual image.

Sounds great, but in practice, it's grueling. After completing several other workouts in succession, the upper-body PAP was something I was only able to observe: two exhausting sets of four exercises, each executed four times in a row.

Food was generally quite good — but of course we were hungry. Pub grub was hardy but basic, and we twice had excellent Indian food. In Painswick, we dined lavishly at Cotswold 88, which changes its menu daily depending on what is available from local farms. After having walked for much of that day through forests that smelled strongly of the wild garlic known as ramps, we had pea soup infused with them, followed by slow-cooked local lamb — and, yes, we felt guilty about eating it after having gotten to know many of the neighborhood sheep.

During Illinois' lost decade, Blagojevich perfected the terrible borrow-and-spend ethos that has rendered state government insolvent — unable to pay bills as they come due. With help from his legislative enablers, Blagojevich accelerated Illinois' downward spiral. He committed Illinois to spend money it did not have on health care expansions and other popularity projects that its taxpayers could not afford. Today state government has nearly $200 billion in debts, overdue bills and unfunded obligations. The distinction of America's worst state credit rating and the wastefully high interest payments that come with it? All yours, Illinois.

Sometimes they know exactly what they're doing, and they just don't care.
It's hard to believe the first-place team in the Western Conference can be considered a secret, but the Blues seemingly haven't gotten the league-wide recognition they deserve. Perhaps it's because they have lagged in the standings for so many years. Perhaps it's because they lack big-time star power. Perhaps it's the grind-it-out, 200-foot-game system instilled by coach Ken Hitchcock.

The newly created district includes half of the former 47th District and encompasses Downer's Grove, Darien, Lisle, Woodridge, Westmont and Naperville. Sandack, who represents the 21st District in the state Senate, was appointed in November 2010 to replace Dan Cronin when he was elected DuPage County Board chairman. Sandack stepped aside in the newly drawn 41st Senate District, where he would have faced a (ahem) daunting primary challenge from Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno of Lemont. His decision will likely earn him the tacit - if not overt - support of state party leaders.

The only bit of imagination was seeing Yniold’s Act IV mini-aria delivered from his bed, as a dream.

During Game 4 of the 1984 NBA finals, the Los Angeles Lakers Kurt Rambis had a chance for a fast-break layup, with Bostons Gerald Henderson a step or two in front of him as he neared the basket. Rambis was clotheslined by the Celtics Kevin McHale on the play, setting the tone for what became an extremely physical remainder of the finals. Oh, look out, is how longtime Lakers announcer Chick Hearn described the play. The Celtics trailed in the series 2-1 at the time of the Rambis-McHale hit. They went on to win the title in seven games, starting with a victory in that pivotal Game 4.

There are fears that these fees could spread to the United States. Any halfway competent airline revenue manager must be looking across the pond with envy, hoping that the European courts let the fees fly. If they do, they could pave the way for a more widespread acceptance of credit card fees here, and with a little linguistic acrobatics - referring to the surcharge as a "convenience" fee - it's not inconceivable that a major domestic airline could embrace these surcharges soon.
I don’t blame Ashley Judd for being hurt by the comments. But it comes with the business that both makes and breaks celebrities. Jennifer Love Hewitt seemed to best express this when she told the Los Angeles Times’ Amy Kaufman that “part of our job as actors is to be eye candy.”

If you prefer summer chills from a much older set of writers, however, Michael Newton provides them in "The Penguin Book of Ghost Stories: From Elizabeth Gaskell to Ambrose Bierce" (Penguin: 416 pp., $15 paper). Since ghosts aren't really supposed to have physical bodies, what harm can they do to us? Lafcadio Hearn asks this question in "Nightmare-Touch," which is part-story, part-psychological examination. Hearn says our fear all stems from "an ancestral experience of nightmare" as well as from our own earliest childhood experiences. He includes a dreadful memory of his parents habitually locking him in his room at night, until he screamed: "Screaming regularly brought punishment; but it also brought back the light…"

More than 75 chief executives have signed a letter against the amendment.

Industry consultant and actuary Claude Thau of Target Insurance Services (800-999-3026) says younger policy-owners might want to think twice about giving up that 5 percent compound inflation protection. Instead, they might reduce the daily benefit to avoid the premium increase. But over time, the compound inflation benefit might leave them better off if they need coverage in 25 or more years. He advises doing the math at a minimum projected 3.5 percent annual inflation rate in care costs.

I'm concerned about your online travel agency's role in this debacle. Why did Expedia hand you off to Lufthansa in your hour of need? One of the reasons you do business with an online travel agency is that they are trusted intermediaries in case something goes wrong with your flight.

Instead, prosecutors said, IEAM used associates and "front" companies to sell shares to unwitting investors. The conduits kept a piece of the proceeds and kicked back the rest to Mazzuto and Margulies or to IEAM, pumping up the share price by making the company look more profitable than it was, prosecutors said, while doctored records made the influx of cash believable.

The impact is tremendous. The body goes from roughly 75 to 80 mph to nearly zero in a nanosecond. The physics of inertia being what they are, internal organs tend to keep going. The force of impact causes them to tear loose. Autopsy reports typically indicate that the jumpers have lacerated aortas, livers, spleens and hearts. Ribs are often broken, and the impact shoves them into the heart or lungs. Jumpers have broken sternums, clavicles, pelvises and necks. Skull fractures are common.

This singer-songwriter has been cranking out exemplary work since the mid- '70s. "The Open Roads" adds a few new keepers to the John Hiatt songbook, including "Movin' On" and "Like a Freight Train," a grizzled blues.

You might think the subject too esoteric. This is precisely what the world thought at several hinge-points in history when out of those hinterlands erupted the Scythians, the Magyars, Attila, Genghis Khan, Kubla Khan, Tamerlane and the like. The artifacts on view come from four separate Kazakh museums but originate from digs and burial mounds that date back to the first millennium B.C. These are the embryonic shoots of a culture that eventually and repeatedly overwhelmed the civilized world. I say "civilized" guardedly. These days nobody uses such terms except to controvert them—and, indeed, the curators are at pains to demonstrate that the nomad horse culture of the steppe was anything but primitive. It achieved a kind of perfection, lasted for millennia, and endures in some version in many rural parts of Kazakhstan today.

OVERKILL OVERDOSE: For months before it opened, there was no avoiding "Bee Movie." A swarm of hype, promo appearances, cameos on NBC, and publicity stunts by Jerry Seinfeld made the gifted comedian seem downright tiresome. By the time the animated feature about an independent-minded bee yearning for a better life actually opened, it already felt overexposed. Maybe it'll be easier to actually see the movie -- which got not-bad, not-great reviews -- on its own terms on DVD. (90 min.; PG)

At the port I could see the whole glorious crescent of bay from the Amalfi Coast to Mt. Vesuvius. Brooding quietly now, the volcano, perhaps best known for its eruption in 79 A.D., erupted eight times in the 1770s when a teenaged Mozart gave a concert in Naples. By that time, the same King Carlos who built the San Carlo had authorized excavation at Pompeii, helping to make Naples a required stop for Grand Tour travelers from Northern Europe.
