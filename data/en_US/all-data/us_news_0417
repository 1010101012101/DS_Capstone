As with the row earlier this year over Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC boss Stephen Hester's bonus, few saw these confrontations coming. Instead, bank executives seem bewildered. Some complain the public fails to understand their predicament. Mr. Diamond argued last week that Barclays was being pulled three ways: by a regulator that wants banks to hold more capital, by politicians that want more lending and by shareholders who want bigger dividends. Other question why banks don't get credit for their efforts to be good citizens such as hitting small-business lending targets or lending to politically popular sectors such as green energy. Many are in denial at the scale of the changes needed to restore public confidence in the industry. Yet though it may not seem like it to those in the firing line, this new assertiveness on the part of investors could be an important part of the solution.

So, I asked, how's the shell different from the taco's shell? It's thicker, he answered.

Jesus forgave an adulterous woman sentenced to be stoned to death and explained away the “eye for an eye” scripture.

Joshua Chamberlain fighting off the Confederates, is viscerally one of the most amazing combat sequences ever done of any war film — the brutality, the whole scope of it, the sense of time and place and the physicality of the battle.

The way Ron Maxwell shot it with the moving camera was very complicated. They had to create a dolly that would go up and down a hill, which obviously is very difficult for a camera crew."

Fortunately, Illinois has a backup plan. Quinn can follow the example of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who set up a New York exchange by executive order earlier this month. An executive order would allow the state to draw down the needed federal funding and make sure the planning moves forward. The General Assembly can improve on the plan, when lawmakers get around to it. The exchanges can start operating in 2014.

When President George W. Bush was running for re-election in 2004, his campaign and the Republican Party reimbursed the White House more than $1.3 million for "airlift operations," an Associated Press review of federal data shows.

Earlier in the year, F-Series pickups were the subject of sniping between the government and Ford because of air bags that could deploy at the wrong time. Ford announced in February that it would fix 150,000 F-150s for that problem, but under pressure from regulators, the company expanded the recall to 1.2 million trucks in April. In that case, there were 98 reported injuries because of the problem.
Alice Lowder shoves a bedspread into the washing machine in the basement of the Grand Avenue Temple in downtown Kansas City. She folds the blankets from the dryer.
"Ten Thousand Saints" is rife with deities. Jude and his sister, Prudence, are named after Beatles songs, but St. Jude is a favorite of Jude's father, now selling marijuana in New York City. Johnny (Teddy's older brother) has fallen under the spell of an ancient Hindu text, "The Laws of Manu," and Teddy's angel floats in and out of the decision-making in the novel. Music too is a form of salvation. Henderson's characters need their saints and signs because no one else is taking care of them.

Just after 4 a.m. comes the wheeze of a diesel engine. Near Northwest Vaughn Street and 26th Avenue, a garbage truck pulls into view and up to a large trash bin. It lifts the vessel up and over, slamming it several times in the name of thoroughness. The bang of metal on metal reverberates off nearby buildings. The truck rattles on to a bike shop, then a veterinary clinic.

Instead of booze slushies and tees at Fat Tuesdays, this low-density town classes it up, tropics-style, with James Bond martinis at the bamboo-and-ceiling fan lounge Martini Bistro (5337 Gulf Drive). A few blocks away, Beach Bistro, the most Zagat-endorsed table within a ride radius, takes up residence in an unlikely concrete waterfront motel. The restaurant is foie gras-ified, and it's the area's big-spending romantic night out, but it's better to squeeze in at its tiny Murphy's Bar, where the menu's signature hits, such as warm duckling salad and a sublime tomato soup with sweet cream, are served to customers who require closer access to professionally crafted cocktails — and less post-suntan grooming (6600 Gulf Drive, Holmes Beach).

The script, for example, introduces the rather sad character of a bullied girl — then drops her. She’s served her purpose in the plot, of course; it’s by joining forces against her that Oliver and Jordana bond. But you do wonder what happened to her. And you wonder if Oliver will ever wonder just what kind of girl Jordana really is.
Changing the landscaping to get water flowing away from the house is sometimes as easy as bringing in some dirt next to the house and getting the ground to pitch away from the house. The slope of the dirt away from the house doesn't need to be anything dramatic - it just needs to be enough to prevent water from sitting next to the house. Of course, the dirt can't be piled too high against the house, because this could hold moisture against the house.

If it's any conversation that doesn't include her, then the problem probably isn't that she's not getting enough attention but rather that she's got work to do in the patience and listening departments. This is not unusual, of course, because kids often have a hard time imagining life from others' perspectives, so gentle but firm counsel about waiting your turn (like you have to do in school, without the raising-hands part) is appropriate. And then when her 4-year-old sister starts interrupting her, you can point out in a not-too-told-ya-so kind of way that now she knows how it feels.
"We're going to do whatever we can to help this team win games, plain and simple whether it's me or him. Obviously, I hope I'm the guy and I'm going to do everything in my power to be that guy, but you have to take it one step at a time."

A good starting point is the Greek spread pikilia ($14), a sampler of yogurt, eggplant and potato-fish roe spreads, perfect for dipping pita bread into. The thick Greek yogurt blended with cucumbers, garlic and dill is divinely rich but also acts as a nice contrast to the tangy eggplant spread. Taramasalata, the potato-roe dip, is smooth and salty, with a good mashed-potato texture.

McGill, who has helped Olympians and professional athletes get their backs back into shape, said the majority of low-back pain stems from the cumulative damage caused by bending forward at the waist.

The Arab Spring has produced signs of similar moderation of political Islam in Egypt, Tunisia and other states where Islamic groups long banned by the authorities have emerged as the most powerful political movements after the collapse of those regimes. In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood won the most seats in elections that followed the fall of former president Hosni Mubarak, but the group has refused to adopt the social policies of the more extreme Salafist religious block or, so far, to abrogate Egypt's peace treaty with Israel.

Instant Sale will also offer $200 to $450 for the most recent iPhone model, iPhone 4, that people have gotten through AT&T Inc., which has been the iPhone’s only U.S. carrier since its launch in 2007. Although AT&T has charged $200 or $300 for the iPhone 4 with a two-year contract, it is actually a subsidized price. Phones actually cost a few hundred dollars more, but wireless carriers figure they can make that back from service fees over the life of the contract.

Let's start with the prattle. "American Dreamz" was written and directed by Paul Weitz, whose debut feature, which he didn't write, was the funny, raunchy "American Pie." Mr. Weitz's new movie takes a small-bore approach to wide-screen potshots at public figures and contemporary issues -- it pokes fun, naughtily and indiscriminately. And it does so in a dumbed-down Esperanto that its audience can't fail to understand -- the universal language of commercial TV sitcoms, with their constrained cultural vocabulary and their subtext of harmlessness: Don't be offended, none of this really means anything, it's just a goof about a lot of dumb stuff going down around us.

The value that a company assigned to an executive's stock and option awards for 2011 was the present value of what the company expected the awards to be worth over time.

"The blinking red light on the [Ravens'] instrument panel is Ed Reed's ankle. That's trouble in River City. Reed is a gamebreaker. He affects your play-calling, as a coach: either you attack guys like Reed with great care, or not at all, because you don't want him going the other way with the ball. If he can't go full speed, the Ravens' defense takes a huge hit."

Let's be clear, if Maryland had set the new budget at the level of the 2009 budget, we would be in significant surplus!

He hasn’t just picked up one or two offers – the talented junior has 13 of them, by far the most of any city standout.

At over 7,400 yards, Rio Secco in Henderson requires an accurate long game (especially at the 7th).

Biggest disappointment is a tie between the Angels and Red Sox. I have no doubt the Angels will figure it out and turn around their season, maybe competing for an AL wild card. But Boston is a mess.

I like football and watch it most weekends. But if the Vikings moved, I would simply find something else to do for three hours on Sunday, most likely another taxpayer-supported activity.

Stops 9 through 12 are really more about Old New York than the Titanic, but survivors could have dined at the Old Homestead Steakhouse on 9th Avenue near 14th Street (which claims a history back to the 1860s but shows no nostalgia in its sleek dining room) or had a drink at McSorley's Old Ale House, which opened on East 7th Street in 1854.

Katz's, which opened in 1888, may be best known these days as the setting for the "I'll have what she's having" scene in the 1989 movie "When Harry Met Sally."

“I guess the writing was on the wall, per se,” Wright said. “You saw the reports and you saw how aggressive Miami was and Miami got a great player. Jose got a contract that he deserved and that he earned. I’m sure he’s happy over there and I’m sure there’s little things that he misses from over here — some of the guys here. But I hope he’s happy with his decision and I think he’s going to have success there.”

Otherwise this car grips like very few machines can and to match its point-and-shoot brutal purity you'd have to spend several times the GT-R's $100,000 asking price. With more electronics than an entire arcade working to keep you moving forward, ever forward as fast as possible, the car isn't so much forgiving as it is willing to just cover up your mistakes. It's a slightly surreal yet endlessly thrilling experience to suddenly worry much less about grip and traction than you are thinking about just keeping your right foot planted.

Sam Muldrow, South Carolina – F/C, 6-9, 222, Sr., Florence, S.C.
-- Portland cuts the lead to single digits and are showing some life late in the quarter. They had a chance to cut it to four, but Wes Matthews misses the shot short.

Fried to order, Finocchio's churros emerge steaming from their fresh oil bath, crunchy, chewy and slightly puffy. The long, slender fritters, just lightly sweetened, bear little resemblance to the run-of-the-mill pretenders made from a mix by many doughnut shops or amusement park vendors. And Churros Calientes serves them with deserved reverence and pomp in a paper-lined silver-tone basket. They're the stars of churrodom, as distinctive as Ludo's fried chicken or Sherry Yard's kaiserschmarrn.

•James D. Nolte, whose license was suspended twice in 2009 and again in August 2011. The most recent suspension for the Wicomico County vet stemmed from a violation of professional conduct, judgment and practice standards, failure to follow protocol for controlled substances, and inadequate record-keeping, the board said. In the 2009 cases, Nolte did not conduct diagnostic evaluations and failed to properly close the surgical incision in a dog's abdomen, among related violations. Discipline has included at least $4,000 in fines, continuing education and probation. In documents from the board, Nolte denied liability but signed consent agreements in the 2009 cases.

I think some figs are best eaten fresh, while others are best dried or made into jam.

Dining at Wolfgang's, I feel as if I'm in a time warp. With its bluster, bonhomie and fawning service, and the pianist belting out stale standards, the place seems left over from the Rat Pack era. Except instead of vodka martinis, deep-pocketed revelers are drinking cult California Cabernets.

The president grinned at her through his oxygen mask and was soon wheeled to the operating room, where he would undergo about three hours of surgery to stop his hemorrhaging -- he would ultimately lose more than half of his blood -- and to retrieve the mangled bullet from his lung.

Their later coupling — fully dressed after a half-naked swim in which they scarcely put a hand on one another — is fiercely passionate without so much as a button unbuttoned.
All is forgiven, Piccolo says, as long as the fencing comes down for good to start the new year.

Former Gov. John Sununu gave an appraisal of Ayotte’s chances, saying she had a strong fiscally conservative record and was a dynamic campaigner, but was probably harmed by the fact that she and Romney were from the same geographic region.

Not only does the actress play the lone lead in a big-budget summer action movie, but she was deemed a suitable replacement for Tom Cruise, the man who once wore the crown of the world's biggest action star and who was originally cast as the film's title character. Instead of Edwin A. Salt, superspy and father, as the initial script had it, filmgoers will meet Evelyn Salt, superspy without children.

The singer-bassist gave the California-based group much of its blue-eyed soul authority. Its biggest hit -- and a song that still sounds great blasting out of a radio or a jukebox -- was 1968's "Midnight Confessions." It's a tight three-minute pop song but also creates the impressions that the four guys who made it were on the absolute edge of desperation.

Another question is whether continuous clearance of senescent cells is needed to produce health benefits, or whether intermittent removal—a spring cleaning of sorts—is just as effective, the study's authors said.
With all due respect to rising-sophomores Freddie Wilson and Sean Grennan, neither is a Big East-caliber point guard. Ball-handling, shot-selection, defense — there's just too many holes right now in both players games to entrust the point guard duties to either right now. Expected to be a part of next year's roster is Tom Maayan — a 6-1 point from Israel and the fourth product via the Canarias Basketball Academy. But he suffered an ACL injury in December, before he enrolled at Seton Hall for the spring semester. Highly-touted prospect Aquille Carr is still a year away, but Seton Hall has a talented enough roster next year where even a decent point guard could make a difference.
Do all doctors in Ohio need to be licensed?

Some Union residents feel like the battle is a never-ending story that needs to find a period.
The out migration slowed when the recession and the housing slump hit in 2009. But it raises the question of what will happen once the economy finally recovers. Will the exodus of Indianapolis residents to Hamilton, Hendricks and other counties resume?
Our methodology is intended only to give an indication of value. It supposes that you pay in full for the time-share (most companies will arrange financing, but interest rates are high). Keep in mind that it's almost impossible to lose money that's invested in a certificate of deposit, whereas the value of the time-share principal may decline. Maintenance fees will definitely go up, but hotel rents also will most likely increase.
He hit upon the idea of a bike ride not just across America  the charity event du jour for most  but out and back and up and down the country. It would be different in another respect, as well: no fundraising.

Strategic persuasion can pay huge dividends, adds Steve Martin (not the guy you're thinking of, but Cialdini's colleague and the British director of the consulting company Cialdini founded, Influenceatwork.com). For example, the British government recently asked him for advice to encourage delinquent taxpayers to pay up. Martin suggested a simple tactic: Instead of threatening people with fines, the government should send out a letter saying that the great majority of Brits pay their taxes on time.
Shanice Daniels, a 22-year-old who lived with Angelozzi, was charged with possession and intent to distribute cocaine and heroin, as well.
He was worth it, particularly after the Knicks became a more defensive-minded team following coach Mike D'Antoni's resignation in March. The Knicks went on to finish seventh in the Eastern Conference and trail Miami 2-0 in their first-round playoff series.

Brady Sr. recalled telling Martinez, "Tom, it's time to go home."
The Sporting News also writes of former Florida safety Bryan Thomas, saying he was given a medical hardship to clear a scholarship spot. Running players off is something that absolutely must be monitored, and the Big Ten does that. The new plan with most major schools offering multi-year scholarships is another step toward protecting players from these situations. I have questioned Meyer about his roster management at Ohio State and will continue to keep tabs on the players who leave and the circumstances under which they depart, but Meyer's reputation in this area is not one of a coach who constantly oversigns at the expense of current players who are following the rules but not producing. Some other SEC coaches have a problem with that.
He wasn't hurt, but he's slowed his pace.
Priority: Economic development and jobs, energy efficiency, build business partnerships, work with other council members.
No matter what, moving out of the No. 6 spot has to be considered one of the team's draft day options.
Well, maybe Shepherd was right.
"Behind our house is a stream called Black Creek, which happens to be quite famous in these parts for trout. I like to cook the bigger fish simply: buried in a baking dish of kosher salt and lots of fresh herbs and lemon slices and then roasted in the oven. It's very ceremonial to bring the baking dish to the table and crack the protective salt layer open to reveal the fish, steamed to perfection and infused with the delicate flavors of herbs straight from our garden." — Suvir Saran
Only then did county commissioners learn about the sewer district's stake in the Sunnybrook Building.
A regular audit of parish finances by the Archdiocese revealed Reilly had diverted about $87,000 in parish money to his own use, leading to his arrest on Feb. 15, Hernandez said.
Finally, it may seem counterintuitive that a religious institution that does not believe in abortion would also not believe in contraception to prevent unwanted pregnancies. However, recent statistics show why. The number of abortions has not decreased as contraception has become widely available. About 23 percent of pregnancies end in abortion, and there are still 1.2 million abortions a year. About half of women having abortions had been using contraception during the month they became pregnant (Guttmacher Institute).
The jet dropped off the radar 21 minutes later, immediately after the crew asked air traffic control for permission to drop from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (3,000 meters to 1,800 meters), said Daryatmo, chief of the national search and rescue agency.
The annual Bumper Bash, a daylong party that has drawn hundreds of boaters in recent years, is an example of a legal use. The gathering of revelers has turned rowdy in the past, and the police presence has been stepped up.
"The No. 1 key was defensively," Rolfes said. "I thought our kids did a great job getting out to their shooters and especially Maddie Stock. Every shot was a contested shot except one."
In the course of a week, Talley, a caseworker for the program, checks in with most of his roughly 55 charges. Some need doctors, some need jobs, some need car repairs. On top of such daily concerns, Talley helps them through the laborious process of applying for low-income housing, though a few prefer a more-or-less permanent berth on the asphalt.
"That's the part that is just plain illegal," he said. "You just can't do that."
Barkin gets all of our sympathy; Miller gets all of the laughs. But they seem more like effects than real characters (the rest of the family, apart from the quietly dignified Burstyn, are simple, awful jokes). There are no surprises, and only a few moments that feel real.
Summa, based in Akron, served more than 227,000 patients in its emergency departments last year, according to the health system. The new Lake Medina location, slated to open in the fall, will include the emergency department as well as outpatient services, a physician medical office building and an ambulatory surgery center. The emergency departments in Medina and Green are expected to open in 2011, according to the health system.
But I was still a little surprised to walk onto the terrace of Martín Berasategui, a restaurant I had been dying to visit for years, and find a scene not far removed from what you would have found at a Michelin three-star restaurant in late-'80s France. The tables were comfortable, the waiters white-gloved, the customers French-speaking, the rustic view almost choreographed, although we were in the middle of the residential suburb Lasarte.
Indeed, much like the lawsuits filed by several states against the new federal health care law, the ultimate goal is twofold: first, to find a case that makes it to the U.S. Supreme Court to further define the relationship between states' rights and federal power; and second, to foment political opposition to the health care law.

The Sunni Muslim royal family claims strict security is necessary to counter Al Qaeda and prevent Iran from instigating sectarian trouble. King Abdullah sent Saudi troops into neighboring Bahrain last year to help crush Shiite protests against that country's Sunni monarchy. Riyadh said Shiite-dominated Iran stirred those demonstrations and is plotting to ignite sectarian tensions near Saudi Arabia's eastern oil fields.

Since I’ve been on the Giants beat (August 2004), the team’s first draft picks each year have been Nos. 43, 25 (traded back to 32), 20, 31, 29, 15 and 19. In trying to project those picks, I’ve hit only one on the head: Kenny Phillips in 2008, whom many saw coming despite the team picking at the end of the first round.

TWO STARS NV Cristalino Cava Extra Dry ($8) In international sparkling wine language, "extra dry" is the sort of misleading terminology Newt Gingrich would love, because it actually means "sweeter than Brut." This wine is good value, with simple lemon and toast flavors; despite the name, it's not overly sweet.
There was all sorts of verbal jousting during the series’ off days, Tuesday and Wednesday. Hunter — himself no stranger to mixing things up during his playing days — accused Boston of targeting the head of Backstrom, who missed 40 games during the regular season because of a concussion.

I know the Type 7 nylon webbing yoking me to Jones' torso can withstand a 7,000 pound pull before it breaks. I know the manufacturing details of the bright yellow and black canopy we'll hopefully be dangling from, and a bit about the complicated physics that dictate how it unfurls, and the aerodynamics that make it function like an inflatable airplane wing. I know a speed and atmospheric pressure sensor in Jones' backpack automatically will pop the reserve chute if we drop too low, too fast.
