Essayist John McPhee wrote a famous article years ago about Princeton forward Bill Bradley, who was a future Basketball Hall of Famer and always a willing passer. It was called "A Sense of Where You Are." In it, Bradley's peripheral vision was measured. The discovery was that Bradley had what amounted to Hubble telescope eyes, able to see things no one else did.
"You get to that point, you always look to be in the (state semifinals)," Lueck said. "We weren't looking ahead at all. We knew Westminster had a good ballclub. We threw our ace at them and he didn't have his best stuff. Westminster's a good hitting team and they hit the ball around."

"It was 4-2 in the third, but there was a strong belief in our bench that we were better 5-on-5," Johnston said. "If we could keep the game to a 5-on-5 game, we could chip away. And then our power play got a big goal there in the third as well."
He also addressed why he has repeatedly asked Mitchell, in the wake of the Fiesta Bowl scandal, in which some lawmakers took extravagant gifts from the non-profit, to go beyond the legal requirements and report gifts of any amount.

In such a no-contest, Sundhage's first and foremost concern was escaping without a serious injury, but Krieger, a 27-year-old right back who started every game in last year's World Cup, went down on a hard tackle late in the first half.

As a result the National Hurricane center issued hurricane warnings for all New Jersey counties that border the Atlantic Ocean, the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River up to Trenton. Hurricane watches are now in effect for Middlesex, Union, Hudson, Essex, Passaic and Bergen counties, but those could be upgraded by day's end.
The food, served from an expansive menu that covers the anticipated waterfront without exceeding the kitchen's abilities, is very, very good. Succulent scallops, veal scallopine, a pair of plump chicken breasts -- all were done to a turn, each retaining its sweet juiciness while sporting a bronzed finish or a crisply crunchy veneer of crumbs. The Veal D'Agnese, paired with toothsome artichoke hearts, is well portioned and lashed with a deftly balanced lemon butter. Don't overlook the excellent risotto alla Milanese -- and if you love seafood, the tidal wave of mussels, clams, calamari, shrimp, orange roughy and salmon that flood D'Agnese's Zuppa di Pesce added music to our mealtime. In a time when so much of our favorite traditional cuisines have been homogenized and denatured into corporate imitations of once-great dishes, it's comforting knowing that places remain where heritage and integrity are honored.
Overnight, Oakland's black population shot from 1,000 to 3,000 -- and African Americans found that in the more accepting community across the bay, many were able to ascend to the middle class.

The amount of cheese and bechamel in the lasagna require a wine with ample weight and tannin, while the mushrooms and squash offer counterpoints of sweetness and earthiness. Plenty of mellow red wines can handle all these elements. Merlot, Malbec and Sangiovese offer depth without overwhelming the subtler flavors, though too much oak becomes intrusive. The food-friendly construction of some wines in the Supertuscan mold can be a perfect option, as can Cab-Merlot or similar blends. Syrah, Australian Shiraz and Spanish reds from Ribera del Duero or Bierzo also provide terrific matches, especially if they offer both earthy notes and ripe purple fruit. The sweetness in the squash, and lack of tomato, also keep white wines as an option; consider dry Riesling, Pinot Bianco and other aromatic, mineral-driven choices. See our Wine Selections (page F4) for specific picks.

Crime in Your Neighborhood was compiled by Joseph Espiritu and consists of selected items from the Orange County Sheriff's Department website, ocsd.org. Calls represent what was told to the deputy in the field by the radio dispatcher. The true nature of an incident often differs from what is initially reported. No assumption of criminal guilt or affiliation should be drawn from the information provided.
Though he often espouses an unsentimental view of his work -- "My job is to work for the owners, who are trying to reach a very expensive piece of real estate" he said -- Baffert's health scare and the close association of the horse to his son have given this week a different feeling.
Put another way, one in every 6.7 family cars sold a year ago was an Accord. Today that's fallen to around one in 10. The Accord isn't in second place anymore. It's slipped to fourth, falling behind the Ford Fusion which will also be redesigned this year.
“I didn’t understand that,” he said. “We’ve been down, but we’ve never played like we’re a team that doesn’t feel good about themselves and doesn’t have a bit of a swagger. So I was pretty animated about that.”
On his favorite Comic-Con memory: "One year I was doing a panel in one of the very large rooms -- just me, that time. They'd decided to limit the actual celebrities' exposure to me, I think. Anyway, I was almost late and I forgot my badge and security wouldn't let me in. They were making calls to fix it, but if I waited for it I was going to be late to my own panel, which seemed sort of rude. So I made an excuse and slipped aside and asked some folks in line to smuggle me through when they went. In retrospect, I was really fortunate they were fans of my work. There was a "Battlestar Galactica" panel after mine and you know you have to show up early to things like that."

It's not unimaginable that, at that time, the place reminded them just a little of their home state, since there was an abundance of springs there, just like the springs that provide the water to make good old Tennessee whiskey.

Four visitors stood around a large pot filled with filtered and bottled water and set atop a turkey burner. A nylon bag filled with grain sat inside, cooking to create a sugary liquid called wort.

Immigration is not a highly technical issue, so it's easy for people to formulate opinions, said Kenneth Fernandez, a political-science professor at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. Generally, most average voters believe the U.S. should be guarding and controlling its borders and enforcing its laws, he said. But those same people don't want the effort to go overboard, causing police officers to use racial profiling to target suspects.
On one side of the table sit representatives of the bondholders, led by Charles Dallara of the Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based lobby group. On the other sit officials of the Greek government, and the troika of the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and European Commission.

But an apparition might have been guiding Wilson in the ninth. He recorded his 48th save, matching the franchise record established by late and beloved closer Rod Beck in 1993.
So many areas of this team need major reinforcement, you could draw up a list of the top needs and not be wrong in ranking them. I looked at the most pressing needs this way: Wide Receiver, Defensive Tackle, Guard, Outside Linebacker, Offensive Tackle. Slice 'em up anyway you'd like. The Rams also have to draft and develop a young running back to succeed (or at least help) Steven Jackson at some point. They have too many needs to take care of in one draft. But they should do everything they can to arm themselves with extra draft picks to attack the problem.

A series of video pieces of dancers is more sophisticated -- technically -- but also more tedious. Shown in a row of digital picture frames, the works each extrapolate from a central image of a dancer, breaking down and recombining her movements in a collage of spinning and twirling planes against a nebulous background of color, light and floating letters. The artists, both based in L.A. and rich in cumulative experience in video, sound, music and performance, clearly had fun at the editing table, but little of their enthusiasm trickles down into the experience of this work.

The middle class has been willing to make concessions, and they have been doing so for a very long time, but we are spent out. Now, the very wealthy and the corporations that have taken advantage of everything this country has to offer continue to refuse to give an inch to bring this economy back from the brink.

Seems the torturer's cat, Wee Thomas, is doing poorly. (In actuality, though Dad's too chicken to come out and say it, the beast looks plenty dead, its brains smushed out in the middle of a road).Padraic, the torturer, turns pale. Wee Thomas, as it happens, is his best and only friend. No surprise there, since Padraic, the sadistic centerpiece of Martin McDonagh's black comedy "The Lieutenant of Inishmore," is a nasty piece of business. In fact, pretty much everyone in "Inishmore" is a nasty piece of business, although Padraic does take the cake.

The idea of going to small-claims court can seem exciting and gratifying. But also know this: Winning may not necessarily require going before a judge.

Instead of Rebecca, you have Rebekka. For Ashley, you have Ashlee, Ashleigh and Ashli. Karen can now be Caryn or Caren. This makes it especially difficult for anyone with an unusually spelled name. You can bet that no one will get it right. So I imagine this is Grandma's way of expressing her disapproval of the spelling of the child's name. - Only The Spelling Has Been Changed

Bridesmaids in white: For years, no woman but the bride dared wear white. But even before Pippa Middleton's bridesmaid gown earned her the nickname "her royal hotness," maids at weddings like Sheaffer's were wearing white. It's not as unorthodox as it may seem.

Besides white (and black), other neutrals are gaining momentum, too.

The proper response to a loss of airspeed information in steady cruising flight is to change nothing: Maintain power and attitude, and the airplane will be fine. The computer could easily have done this, but the programmers who designed the A330's flight management system evidently thought it wiser to let the pilots take charge. They never imagined that a pilot would get it so terribly wrong.

While that means the kitchen can respond to an ever-changing marketplace, it also puts a lot of pressure on the staff. Plus, if you're doing only one menu, each course needs to hit the bull's-eye.

Here is the government’s justification for penalties: You are now what economists call a "free rider." Your decision not to pay anything for health care, they say, is tantamount to ignoring the ever-present risk that you might get sick or injured. And if you do get sick or injured now, your care is effectively paid through taxpayer funds — through charity or emergency care, for example — even though you lack the insurance plans that other people pay for. For health-care reform to be sustainable, and to make financial sense for insurance companies, even relatively healthy people must have a plan. They can’t wait until they get sick or hurt to buy one.

So, yes, he explained, his abysmal output in April 2012 frayed his nerves.

They might try things out here before they take them elsewhere. So for us it's an advantage, though it might appear at first as a disadvantage.

They Blazers also could negotiate their own multiyear deal with Oden or, if he does not generate any free agent interest, simply sign him to the one-year qualifying offer.

Outlook: The Ravens have identified a handful of prospects that they feel will be able to jump start their stagnant return game and they’ll undoubtedly try to come out of the draft, or the un-drafted free agent period that follows with one of them. NFL draft guru and Baltimore native Mel Kiper Jr. said that he feels that both Adams or Hilton would be really good fits for the Ravens possibly with their third-round picks. Adams had four punt return touchdowns last season for Arkansas, though he didn’t return kicks. Of the Ravens’ primary kick returners this past season, David Reed, who sustained a season-ending knee injury last season, is not certain to be ready for the start of the season. Tom Zbikowski left in free agency. Primary punt returner Lardarius Webb just got a five-year, $50 million contract extension and team officials would prefer that the Ravens’ top cornerback isn’t in harm’s way more than necessary. Webb, however, has expressed a willingness to remain in that spot.

For those of us who weren't around yet in 1941, history and movies have helped to keep the stories of Pearl Harbor fresh in our minds.

For some Christians, Dec. 25 is literally the anniversary of the birth of Jesus, and of course, Jesus is the foundation of Christianity. The Catholic Church, for example, in the Roman Martyrology for Christmas day contains a formal announcement of the birth of Christ in the style of a proclamation. It begins with creation and relates the birth of Jesus to the major events and people of sacred and secular history. They, and many others, celebrate this day as the actual anniversary of the birth of Jesus. Is that your view? If so, choose Option 2: I celebrate Christmas as the actual anniversary of the birth of Jesus.

The Baywood Inn, across the street from the shore, was designed as an office complex in the 1970s, but the developer ran out of money. The current owners finished the building and converted it into an inn in 1990. All but two rooms have bay views. The exterior still looks very much the generic 1970s office complex, but individually themed rooms - even the wall, floor and fireplace materials are different - are contemporary, tempered with traditional decorative molding, gas fireplaces and distinctive furniture. It's a good fit for this modern yet traditional community and easily the area's best value.

Funny enough, pasta doesn't seem to be the restaurant's strong suit. Or at least not on my last couple of visits.

Coleman’s adaptation of the play is, then, largely about theater and storytelling and why we need them. To this end, Coleman’s production strips the play down to its essential elements.

Admittedly, this wine is expensive. But it's not easy to find what appears to be a pure Pinot from California that's so good. With 13.9 percent alcohol, this wine benefits by a slight chill before serving. The color, with soft medium-intense tones of bright red fruit, actually looks like Pinot, not like the Syrah-blended Pinots I normally taste from California. The aroma includes red and black cherry, with some earth and spice. The taste offers a full of nice, soft, elegant fruit with a creamy finish. The overall feel is lively and balanced with a clean finish. It's a good one. 91 points.
