One area where that is starkly clear is with the Medicaid program, the state and federally funded health care plan for people struggling near the poverty line. The Republican budget that passed the House of Representatives would impose steadily larger cuts in federal funding to state Medicaid programs — a 5 percent cut in 2013 and a cut approaching 33 percent by the 10th year. Maryland's Medicaid program would lose billions of federal dollars if those cuts were enacted. This plan would not just cut Medicaid but would fundamentally alter its very structure, turning it into a no-strings-attached "block grant" program. This approach would give governors a blank check for pet initiatives and a license to cut support for seniors and low-income kids.

Cars.com Executive Editor Joe Wiesenfelder points out that when designers lean back the front pillars to improve aerodynamics, that also moves the pillars further forward, where they're more likely to be in your line of vision. In back, trunks are higher now partly to increase cargo volume without making the car longer, Wiesenfelder says. A hatchback profile or "fastback" rear design also improves aerodynamics, so rear pillars and windows now tend to have a smooth, shallow slope instead of a steep angle. That often results in a narrower rear window.

What these politicians fail to realize is that the largest sector of the electorate resides somewhere near center rather the far left or the far right, and we vote that way. The American public expects to be governed in a way that reflects common sense and compromise rather than political partisanship. The political fringe elements don't decide elections; it is the vast majority of voters near the center in their beliefs who do. History has demonstrated that Americans use the voting booth when government moves too far to the right or left. At this point, we do not have the option of a "no confidence" vote in our elected officials. So we must use the system in place.

That's why a Rodeway Inn could be one of the 10 highest-rated hotels in the Los Angeles area, Trip Advisor said.

Yet right now, even though many of the worlds brightest STEM students train in our universities, the federal government forces many of them to leave as soon as they are handed a diploma. When these graduates return to their home countries, they go to work for foreign companies that compete against us  or they found companies that will create jobs overseas, rather than here in the U.S. This is the federal government at its most frustrating.

Ables, who has seven American Girl dolls of her own, says she likes that the brand encourages reading for children. "I like it better than them playing Nintendo," she said.
But if you listen to Karl's apologists, finishing sixth in the West was a hoops miracle. Really? Listen to what Bret Adams, the coach's lawyer, sent me in an e-mail as the Nuggets ended the regular season on a roll.
"Titanic" (1997 and 2012): Writer-director Cameron's titanic hit — which is set for a 3-D rerelease April 4 — was the first film to sail past the billion dollar, box-office beacon. It was nominated for 14 Oscars and won 11, including best picture and best director. It's tarnished some by its over-the-top flourishes: Billy Zane wielding a gun, really? Three decades after "The Morning After," Maureen McGovern's disaster ballad for "The Poseidon Adventure," Celine Dion ruled the airwaves — and then some — with "My Heart Will Go On." (Both songs won Oscars.) Last but hardly least, "Titanic" ensured first-class passage to the A-List for young stars Winslet and especially DiCaprio.

"And my wife, Jenine? ... Whether I made or missed that shot, I still had an opportunity to meet her. The most important things that happened — getting married, having children and grandchildren, having success in business and in life — they would have happened anyway. That shot was not the most important thing that happened in my life."
When guidebooks describe the Mission as "eclectic," you only have to sit at Nombe to realize that's an understatement. Windows overlook utilitarian storefront banks from El Salvador and Mexico, with the second floor devoted to a dentist's office lined with examination chairs, x-ray machines and drills. Wonder if that's why my tooth suddenly started aching?
What concerns him most now is not being able to speak with the Magic's athletic trainer, Keon Weise, and the team's strength and conditioning coach, Joe Rogowski. No NBA employee is permitted to speak with a player or a player's agent during the lockout, even if it's just via text message.

Utah (26-26, 1-20 Pac-12) jumped out to its first lead of the series in the top of the first inning, scoring three runs, but ASU (45-5, 17-2) steadily closed the gap before taking over with a four-run fourth and then getting seven more runs combined in the fifth and sixth to end the game by run rule.
Trey lures the lightly infected Dylan to the demimonde, where he and his vampire vixens hope to put a bite on Dylan's girlfriend, Sara (Adrian Slade). But in this flick, the dark side is as bright as a cruise-ship showroom, where the singing and dancing would fit nicely, while the jokes are as dull as Disney sitcom throwaways.
“Whatever the elections board decides is what it is, but the voters could have decided this,” Cunningham said. “Judy had everything going for her. She’s a sitting congresswoman with $1.2 million in her campaign fund, and I’m nothing but a small Kane County clerk.”

I'm also disappointed that Tancredo thinks he can step in there and win. If Tancredo thinks he's going to be the savior, I think that's a joke. Truthfully, I think the only person we have left is Dan Maes. I voted for him."
9. Byers vs. Front Range Christian, today, 1 p.m.
Perhaps the single most important concession Exelon agreed to is a provision that under certain circumstances — such as the bankruptcy of Exelon or a major subsidiary, a credit downgrade or the failure to comply with Maryland Public Service Commission rules and orders — the PSC could initiate hearings to force the company to spin off BGE. That's an idea the state Office of People's Counsel had floated, and one that Exelon had seemed unlikely to accept. It provides Maryland with a failsafe option should its greatest fears about the merger come true.

When the 17-year-old and the juvenile ran from the group, the 15-year-old fired his weapon, said Sheriff Armando Fontoura said in the release. The 17-year-old was struck in the neck, he said.
Suppose a European author wrote a strong critique of President Obama's policies on detaining and trying terror suspects; in response, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton forbade the writer from entering the country. To most Americans, that would be an outrageous violation of the free-speech principles this country holds dear. Yet when Israeli officials commit such an obvious offense against their nation's own progressive values, many are willing to give them a pass. Israel is a small country that feels threatened in a way the U.S. doesn't, but barring Grass does nothing to strengthen Israeli security.
Even the name Ohmega fit in with the era. According to Drobinsky, the yard was so named because ohms are the electrical measure of resistance and, at the time, recycling materials represented resistance to the status quo. Om is also a Hindu chant that had become popular with the counterculture in the '70s, and omega is the last letter of the Greek alphabet. "This the end point for the stuff, but all of a sudden it gets a new life. Instead of being thrown away it's reborn," Drobinsky said.
With his team also 5-0 on the road, Coppa said he has talked to his players about going undefeated — the Tigers finish at home against Pueblo Centennial — "and we want to be finishing things off the right way. We can get a higher seed and more home playoff games."
Tomlin's elbow: Right-hander Josh Tomlin had an MRI scan that confirmed the initial diagnosis of sprained elbow, which forced him to the disabled list (retroactive to Aug. 25).
The plaintiff's attorneys showed Ford had rejected making a cheap ($4- to $11-per-car) repair to the millions of Pintos on the road - a repair that would have solved the problem with its exploding gas tanks. The key piece of evidence was the discovery of an internal Ford memo in which it appeared the company had weighed the expense of paying out settlements for future accident victims (about $50 million) against the total cost of the retrofit (almost three times that amount). Ford had literally calculated how many people would be killed and maimed. The judgment against Ford was $128 million, a record at the time, and hastened the end of the Pinto. Since then, the firm has won a staggering amount of money in traffic cases, including a $4.9 billionjury award against GM in an L.A. case in which six people were badly burned when their car was rear-ended.
Republican congressional leaders, three of whom are on the commission, similarly remained neutral about the draft, even as conservative groups condemned the chairmen's proposal to raise any revenues at all.
Ford's earned 61 cents per share, easily beating Wall Street expectations of 50 cents per share. Until the final three months of last year, Ford had consistently beaten estimates. Many analysts lowered their outlooks after the automaker's full-year numbers last year because the company missed expectations, despite big increases in sales and profits.

"I am glad the responsible party has come forward to clear up the matter," Pryor said. "I had already referred the case to the FBI, and it is now up to them to determine whether a crime has been committed."
This star-studded action-comedy isn't as slick as "Ocean's Eleven," and its sociopolitical message is pretty shallow, but it's the kind of breezy blockbuster entertainment that doesn't come around often enough. Ben Stiller plays a hotel manager who recruits a professional thief played by Eddie Murphy to help him get revenge on a billionaire con man played by Alan Alda. There are plot holes aplenty and the big twists arrive too abruptly, but stellar performances — including hilarious deadpan turns by Matthew Broderick and Casey Affleck — and a handful of memorably funny lines make this a surefire video rental and undoubtedly a basic-cable staple someday soon. The DVD and Blu-ray add a commentary track, a gag reel, deleted scenes and alternate endings.
"Not a week goes by when somebody doesn't say to me, 'Why can't you bring back the Checker?'" he said. "The cars that are on the road today just have not generated the same type of affection and passenger loyalty."

LAS VEGAS -- Donald Trump on Thursday endorsed Mitt Romney for the Republican presidential nomination, a move with little likely impact on voting but rich with billionaire-meets-millionaire symbolism.
Zebra mussels aren't the only species under study in the St. Croix River. Three more species -- sheepnose, snuffbox and spectaclecase -- were added to the federal endangered list in recent weeks. The Higgins eye and winged mapleleaf have been on the list for years.
"It was tough," said Jackman, now 30. "You get so excited. You're starting off after having a year off (because of the lockout). You have a new coach in Mike Kitchen, who was very excited to be a part of it. I mean, you're thinking everything is coming together.
I write this from the comfort of my couch, not from boot camp, but still I channel a sad kinship with the doe-eyed Goldie Hawn from that 1980 film. I could go out to lunch, but my old haunt -- Joseph-Beth Booksellers at Legacy Village -- is in its sixth month of gone by now, and so I mourn.
A spokesman for the state Republican Party, Doug Mayer, seized on the revelations, saying in a statement, "It is clear the assemblyman is only really sorry he got caught — not that he tried to bully a State Police trooper into letting him off the hook."
When he gets home, he posts a few portraits on his Facebook page, along with recollections from his conversations with the people he photographed. (He doesn't take notes and doesn't ask for names.) Within seconds, the comments multiply.
Other hits followed: the similar “She Bangs” and “Shake Your Bon-Bon,” the lovelorn “She’s All I Ever Had,” the Christina Aguilera duet “Nobody Wants to Be Lonely.”
The stunning thefts have led some Dixon residents to call for Burke and the City Council to resign. Some foes gathered for about an hour across from City Hall on Tuesday afternoon after hearing the latest allegations against Crundwell, according to the group’s leader, Jennifer De Maria.
It was enough to remind some people on Wall Street of the heady late 1990s and the debuts of companies like Netscape Communications — and, more infamously, long-forgotten names like Pets.com and Webvan. Investors wondered whether LinkedIn will be a precursor to another financial frenzy in Silicon Valley.
Sometimes the question isn't whether a particular dog can perform a task but whether some tasks are even canine-ly possible. Take seizure detection again. "Is that legitimate?" Bain says. "Maybe."

"The problem they face is the same as when generals became presidents – they're used to telling people what to do," Sonenshein said. "They have to transition from a hierarchical to a horizontal structure."
Honda's Indy optimism is based on the assumption that its single turbo will power through the Speedway's sweeping corners better than the twin turbos used by Chevrolet and Lotus.
And they shouldn't. Elections supervisors are more sophisticated than ever in cleaning up voters rolls and protecting against potential fraud. Each month they run checks against state databases to remove voters who've died or gone to prison. They will not send ballots to people who have moved without notifying the elections division. And they check signatures of those who've submitted ballots against the signatures on record.
While several other students in Cardoso's situation have gone public with their stories in hopes of staying, immigration law expert Michael A. Olivas said they could be jeopardizing parents or other relatives who are here illegally. In most cases, he said, their best strategy is to try to stay off the radar of immigration authorities and wait for a change in policy.

"I'll come back. I promise. I mean, hopefully I'm coming back here for another 20 years. If I don't figure it out on my 20th go, there's something wrong," he said with a chuckle. "Something about this place I just can't quite get to grips with. It's just a course that you have to figure out, and it's taken me a while. I'll come back next year and try to make it to the weekend.

Fields then described the struggle between the two after she fell and Robison grabbed the shovel.
I'm a pragmatist, so I'm not a believer in Punxsutawney Phil's prognostication ability. It's just a cute tradition. But Hewitt's report is a solid sign that things may indeed be turning around for the economy.

Streep was not the only connection to MacGillivray's life that resurfaced. The music for the film was a dream fulfilled. George Harrison had provided music for "Everest," one of MacGillivray Freeman's movies. This time around, the filmmaker thought about Sir Paul McCartney.
The complaint comes as the volunteer group Friends of Last Thursday has been tasked with addressing neighbor complaints and making the event self-sustaining. The city for years has subsidized the event with some transportation and policing costs.

For instance, she thinks back on her former series, "Without a Trace," and how hard it was when that series concluded three years ago. For seven seasons she played Samantha Spade, a field agent in a Missing Persons task force, "and when you've done one character that long," she says, "there's a grieving process, almost, when it ends."

While he was embarrassed about seeing his almost-naked body on the screen, David admits he felt more confident shooting the commercial.
Matheny clearly likes to run more. When he has a healthy lineup, he prefers to stick with it. He hasn't been big on double switches as he pinch-hits for the pitcher. He doesn't mind bringing his relievers out for a second inning, if he believes they can do it and provide the matchup he wants. Matheny also has shown a willingness to ride his No. 3 and No. 4 starting pitchers when they are throwing well. La Russa seldom viewed Kyle Lohse in that light.
Beck honed his chops with a couple of other bands before he joined the Yardbirds, whose hits included the Top 5 smash “For Your Love.”
If the idea takes form, a Sunshine official said, the charity will consider selling its shelter at 1520 North 13th Street to McKee's company, which has amassed substantial holdings on the near north side.

There's something fundamentally Portand about the experience here. Soccer and all. Timbers Army, included. The pouring rain, the chants, the guy wearing a Timbers cap on top of his rain hat, the standing for hours, and the fact that the sport alone is enough to carry the evening. It's so Portland here that a Timbers game now feels as essential to quickly understanding this city as a visit to Powell's Books and Pioneer Courthouse Square and the Rose Garden at Washington Park.
Moving on. There's a new winner in the category of least-flattering style of the season. And with hot pants you get a twofer: a terrible look and an insulting name that suggests sexual promiscuity.
A key reserve, Harrington scored seven points before being sidelined.
There are plenty of celebrities and politicians who make bad decisions as parents but take a public position that they are actually role models. The latest and perhaps most unfortunate example is Bristol Palin, the mother of a 4-month-old boy who is now taking on the role of spokeswoman to prevent teen pregnancy.
"Energy efficiency enhancements have up-front costs that are paid back over time through savings on your energy bills," FirstEnergy spokeswoman Ellen Raines said Monday. "The savings far outweigh the cost of the program. And we hope customers who have not used CFL bulbs will like them.
"It is definitely important for the bank and for the donors to know that there is a strong commitment in Ukraine to do everything necessary to ensure that the Chernobyl project progresses well," Novak told The Associated Press.

Major Dave and Rachel complete the tower task -- with a cheery Rachel telling her husband mid-descent, "Honey, you look like my super hero!" to which he cheerily responds, "I am!" And they get through a shave ice challenge without any problem. (Extra fun: The guy who bestows the signature yellow clue envelope is Taylor Wily, who plays shrimp truck owner and shave ice expert Kamekona on "Hawaii 5-0.") The duo even gets through the helicopter ride and a Baywatch-style lifeguard challenge involving big waves, a wave runner and a faux-drowning swimmer, without any problem. Then it goes south.
"Whatever comes out of the Fairport investigation is a separate issue," said John Williams, director of the PUCO's service monitoring and enforcement department.

Maurice, who stands a little over 5 feet tall and favors shiny pink lip gloss, is one of the lowest-ranking and lowest-paid soldiers at this base in Wardak province, south of Kabul. Her life is a glimpse into the American-Afghan partnership at the bottom rungs of the U.S. military, where even the simplest acts of kindness do not easily translate across a wide linguistic and cultural divide.
It's one of the many ways the Deschampses re-created the flavor of life they experienced in Tokyo, where they lived with their daughters when Fred worked for Northwest Airlines. In part because their daughters were school-aged, the Deschampses jumped at the chance to move back to St. Paul when Northwest merged with Delta. But they didn't want to leave behind the serene and simple spaces they had grown to love. And being close to family members was also high on the list.
“Every time a fighter receives a blow to a nerve, potassium leaves the cell and calcium rushes in, destabilizing the electrolyte balance, while the brain does all it can to keep these levels in balance. With each successive blow, this balance becomes harder and harder to maintain, and more and more energy must be spent in the process. When the body reaches the point where the damage outweighs the body’s ability to repair itself, the brain shuts down to conserve enough energy to fix the injured neurons at a later point.”

This wasn't a job that was just handed to me. I took a meeting and the network was like, "Michael Ealy — he does drama. I don't know about him." I had to go in and audition and earn the job. That's why I'm proud of it as well because they didn't believe I could do comedy. I had to show them I could do comedy. And I was able to earn the job.

But the incumbent, former Dublin Mayor Guy Houston, is far to the right of the governor on many key issues. Pick one of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's signature accomplishments of 2006 -- fighting global warming, raising the minimum wage, delivering prescription drug discounts for the uninsured, restoring Prop. 98 K-12 funding -- and Republican Houston voted against them all.

The best lasagne the Munchmobile driver has sampled in the past five years came at a previous visit to Trattoria La Sorrentina (7831 Bergenline Ave., North Bergen; 201-869-8100). How’s the pizza?

This Todd ("Hangover") Phillips production produces its share of explosive laughs, mostly of the "Oh my God" variety.

Larry Summers, Obama's chief economic adviser, told reporters that if the measure isn't passed soon, it will "materially increase the risk the economy would stall out and we would have a double-dip" recession.

After a few days in Poland, my first thought was not cat but kota.
Ebanks' 12 points all came in the first half and at one point led in the team in scoring. Yet his performance encapsulated how Ebanks has treated playing time as less of an audition and more as a way to prove his fundamentally steady growth.

"Greece will not make it," said Sinn.

And, it turns out, dinner was worth the wait. Formerly Thomas Keller's right-hand man, Cerciello and his team are turning out some wonderful country cooking in the city. The ingredients are impeccable, the execution skilled. Service is crisp and assured, and servers know a great deal about the food. Ask any question about a dish, they know the answer. Wine service under Michel Darmon, another veteran of Keller restaurants, is excellent too, and his list holds some delightful, well-priced finds.
Afterward, Gerstenmaier defined those "minor" services as "engineering services, sustaining engineering analysis, power margins — typical standard integration and engineering services."
Unless they make a trade that sheds them of contracts, the Cardinals will project the same starting rotation for 2012 that they imagined for 2011, complete with a surgically repaired Adam Wainwright. Chris Carpenter, Wainwright, Jaime Garcia, Jake Westbrook and Kyle Lohse all have/will have contracts guaranteed for 2012. That doesn't leave any room for the return of Edwin Jackson, the addition of a young pitcher (Lance Lynn, Marc Rzepczynski), the courtship of a free agent (Mark Buehrle?), or the scratch-off lottery ticket signing of a veteran to gamble on (Erik Bedard?).

But as the House was checking the stadium and bonding bills off its end-of-session to-do list, Republican lawmakers were scrambling to salvage one of their caucus' top priorities, the tax bill. Gov.

That leaves the Dayton-backed plan as the only option. Legislators have snagged for months on a provision that would allow electronic pulltabs and sports-themed tip-boards in bars and restaurants as a means of raising money to pay the state's share of the stadium.

In Yuma, the blackout didn't last as long in town as it did in San Diego. Many residents said their power was restored around 6 or 7 p.m. And in a city where daytime temperatures can climb to 115 degrees and evenings are frequently spent in 90-degree heat, that's a good thing.

The endless delays in the Werdesheims' trial have already tested the good work done on both sides to smooth any racial divide in Park Heights.

UConn has a coach who needs to retire, but won't.

Nor does it count the three Big East games he missed this season because of recruiting violations. Or the 2013 NCAA tournament he will miss, along with the rest of his program, because of UConn's lousy graduation rate."
