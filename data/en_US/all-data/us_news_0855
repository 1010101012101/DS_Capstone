An August study in the journal Circulation found that moderate consumption of high-quality (high percent of cocoa) chocolate was associated with a decreased risk of heart failure in a very large sample of Swedish women.

The levees and flood walls that keep the Mississippi River out also hold the rainwater in. Trees and brush flourish in the fertile soil, obstructing the flow of drainage canals. Roofs and pavement in hilltop communities like Belleville and Fairview Heights and Collinsville cover ground that once absorbed water, adding to the cascade down the bluffs and into what amounts to a bowl.

"Tonight we didn't come here ready to play," McMillan said. "Kind of felt like we started the All-Star break tonight and did not come out focused and ready to play. No excuse for that first-half effort. We knew this team would come out and be aggressive and play hard after their loss last night."

These two teams haven't played since 2008 — the year before Griner showed up — but Nneka Ogwumike is eager for the chance. Ogwumike faced Griner in an AAU game back in high school, and that's when she insists she learned to shoot three-pointers because scoring in the paint was a big problem. But the senior feels like everybody else in the country has already faced Griner, and now she's finally getting that chance in her NCAA tournament farewell.
These jokes are nothing new to Portlanders, who poke fun at themselves for plenty of the same things.

"Portlandia" brings a parody version of that Portland to a national audience.
Fufu is West Africa's staff of life. And like rice in Asia or bread in Europe, the doughy starch balls come in several varieties: smooth-pounded white yam, a slightly gooier cassava (tapioca) version called eba, or orbs of pounded rice.

The Lorain Sand Bar is giving up good numbers of walleye from both the inside and outside edges of the sandbar. The area north of Beaver Creek has been best while trolling large spoons, minnow-style plugs and big tandem-bladed spinner rigs in pink, purple and chartreuse and tipped with a nightcrawler. The best depths for walleye have been 39 to 42 feet on the inside edges of the sandbar, and 40 to 48 feet on the outside drop-offs.

But in Washington, a compromise aimed at preventing federal taxpayer money from paying for abortions prompted several anti-abortion Democrats to back President Barack Obama's landmark health care bill.

But this isn't just any Albanian film, and Mr. Marston isn't just any California filmmaker. He's an artist with the instincts of a social anthropologist who chose to make his debut feature, "Maria Full of Grace," in Spanish, and to set it in Colombia, as well as the U.S. He pulled off that improbable project with great panache, and all sorts of honors ensued, including an Oscar nomination for the film's leading lady, Catalina Sandino Moreno.

"Legislators have been even more sensitive about re-election," Herrod said.

Other rationales put forward by Protect Marriage don't hold up to inspection, Reinhardt said - outlawing same-sex marriage doesn't encourage men and women to marry, enhance existing marriages, or protect children being raised by California families, including tens of thousands of same-sex households.

For Berggruen has over the last year quietly spent tens of millions of dollars buying museum-quality works by 12 leading contemporary artists, which he says he intends to donate to the museum — if some general conditions are met.

Tug of war can also be a wonderful training tool to teach lessons in self control. For example, when playing tug with me for the first time the dog must first offer me a sit. I don't tell the dog to sit. I wait for a sit to occur then the dog is rewarded for it. I may teach a dog how to jump on command to grab at the toy, to teach a reliable “off” or “drop it.” Most dogs love this game so much they'll do most anything to keep playing. The key is not leaving the toy laying around after games. If you do the toy will begin to lose its value much like old toys in a toy box. To keep the toy valuable put it away after games for another day so the game always is new and fun when you take the toy out.
When Chilton re-entered that studio a few weeks later for his first recording session, he would emerge with a hit: His impossibly soulful reading of Wayne Thompson's "The Letter" became one of the biggest singles of 1967, the first of seven top 40 hits for the Box Tops, and the beginning of what would become one of the most brilliant, enigmatic and maddening careers in rock history.

NOTES: Miami manager Ozzie Guillen became annoyed in his pregame chat with reporters when a Houston reporter asked him if the uproar over his comments about Fidel Castro, for which he was suspended five games, had died down in the last month. He told the reporter to "grow up" while including a couple of curse words. ... Guillen said he's hoping Heath Bell, who was demoted from the closer's role last week, can return to that role in the future. "We're a better ball club if Bell is our closer," he said.

The act was intended to replace timber sale money, which for decades paid for services in many rural counties. Federal forests make up 60 percent of Oregon's timberland but provide no property taxes to the counties where they are located.

In the counties, some of the timber money paid for general operations and some was mandated for roads only.

But the truth is, progress has been painfully slow. Millions of jobs were lost before our policies even had a chance to take effect – a hole so deep that even though we've added jobs again, millions of Americans remain unemployed. Hundreds of thousands of families have lost their homes; millions more can barely pay the bills or make the mortgage. The middle-class is still treading water, while those aspiring to reach the middle class are doing everything they can to keep from drowning. Meanwhile, some of the very steps that were necessary to save the economy – like temporarily supporting the banks and the auto industry – fed the perception that Washington is still ignoring the middle class in favor of special interests. And so people are frustrated and angry and anxious about the future. I understand that. I also understand that in a political campaign, the easiest thing for the other side to do is ride this fear and anger all the way to Election Day.

I'm not saying it will, but if any network could do what others say is impossible, that network is CBS. It could put eyes on Saturday night.
Browns General Manager Tom Heckert said last month at the NFL owners meetings that he's prepared to stay at No. 4, but would also consider moving down a few spots. The Eagles would most likely have to give up at least their two second-round picks to move up to No. 4: the 46th and 51st overall.

He would work 16 hours a day, go back to the shop to sleep on a cot for a few hours, and hit the street again. My mom and I would sometimes bring him lunch in a remote area of the city and he would come out from under a canopy in which he was working and climb down the telephone pole. On some of the worst nights I can remember, our telephone would ring at 2 or 3 a.m. calling him in to work.

He said no decisions have been made about how many U.S. troops would be required to remain there once the combat role has ended. He suggested, however, that large reductions, below the 68,000 troop level projected for this September, were unlikely in the months immediately after the shift. The U.S. now has about 91,000 troops there as part of the International Security Assistance Force. The fact that much military work will remain after 2013 "demands that we have a strong presence there," he said.

Webb was so gifted, Nicholls State wasn't exactly sure where to play him. The first game he played for the Colonels, he intercepted three passes and ran one back for a touchdown. Nicholls State used him at cornerback, running back, quarterback and as a returner. Eventually the coaches stuck him at safety and asked him to do his best impression of Ed Reed. He became the only player in NCAA Division I history to receive the conference awards of Offensive Player of the Week, Defensive Player of the Week and Special Teams Player of the Week in a single season.

Augustín and Monica are caught between old narrow ideas and traditions on the one hand and the need and desire to freely express who they are on the other. This quandary is epitomized by the fact that Augustín, who came to the U.S. when he was 2, has no memory of or connection to Mexico; he belongs neither here nor there. He inhabits a strange liminal zone, as does his sister with her ambivalent sexuality and the play’s other two characters: Augustín’s friend Mimi (Daniel Moreno), a gay female impersonator, who may be a man but feels more comfortable as a woman, and a homeless street person, Cruz (Dañel Malán), who lives a reality where past loss and present woe seem to blend eerily.

Originally slated to open in 2006, the terminal was plagued with ballooning budgets and delays in its early years. The first design firm was fired and the project had to be re-set.
Maybe he realized that he could have dropped stinkbombs on the audience and he'd still have gotten a wild ovation. The young girls in the crowd (and many of the young girls' parents) cheered footage of Bieber playing Xbox. They cheered a tape of Bieber the infant singing the ABC song. They cheered his anthropologically interesting attempt at breakdancing. Such devotion makes outsiders suspicious. But when Bieber tore into a song, he justified much of the hysteria. "One Time," the closest thing he has to a club number, hit like a karate chop; "One Less Lonely Girl" burned with randy urgency missing in its studio version. The borderline-inane "Eenie Meenie," performed with support act Sean Kingston, somehow overcame its lyric; "Baby," the encore, was a spin on the Tilt-A-Whirl after a long day in the sun. Best of all was the piano ballad "Down to Earth," a four-minute classic-rock throwback that culminated in harmony guitar solos. No, honest!, it did.
"No we didn't," he said on the margins of the motor show. "But I know another Indian company has: Mahindra."
"You've seen corporate profits high," he said. "It's now time to get that translated ... into the adding of jobs, building of factories and buying of equipment here at home."

Typically, a well-equipped sniper in World War II could be expected to hit a human target with a single shot at about 600 yards in favorable conditions and during daylight. Today, snipers can typically hit targets at twice that range  from more than half a mile away  and at night, said Bryan Litz, a ballistics expert at Berger Bullets who has done military contract work.

Last year, Senate Bill 1070 brought heaps of national scorn to a state that needs tourists, conventions and high-end business investment. The law, now tied up in court, did nothing to curb illegal immigration. But it did result in national commentators tagging Arizona as anti-Latino, not just anti-illegal immigrant.

Long marginalized by the Sudanese government in Khartoum, the southern part of the country was one of the most destitute, least developed places on Earth, with just a few miles of paved road. But last year's peaceful secession sparked a surge of hope among South Sudanese. With their own flag, their own government, their own oil, they would build a decent country.
The most recent attempt was last year, when the Ohio Legislature, motivated by the federal investigation, appointed a nine-member commission to recommend an alternative form of government.

On a recent trip to Los Angeles, I met some Howard Dean supporters (and yes, they still identify themselves as such) who were grieving not because of the Democrats' midterm defeat but because they have had to let go of their idyllic notion about what Obama stands for. They would rather, it seems, have a liberal lion, growling at conservatives, than a leader willing to compromise to get things accomplished.

"On one hand I feel like, yes, it's necessary for the U.S. to take the troops out because of the economic situation that's happening here in the United States. At the same time, I don't know if Iraq is ready and at that stage that it can be left right now. I feel there's still a lot of uncertainty still there. Do I feel absolutely OK with the troops going out? I don't think I would say that."

On Monday, a South Euclid gas station owner told the Better Business Bureau he'd been approached last week by Rodney Bowling of Mastermind about a program that would give station customers a small rebate for gas if they filled out a survey. Brian Fiori was supposed to mine these for sales leads for auto repairs. Fiori said the program sounded good enough that he gave Bowling car repairs and a check for $500.

With irises, you first lift a cluster of them from the ground with a spade or, better yet, a garden fork. Then, carefully work apart several of the fat rhizomes and their roots. Replant them elsewhere, being careful not to put them more than an inch or so under the dirt. (Irises won't bloom if you plant them too deeply.)

On the TV broadcast, Miller, who committed two turnovers in the final 1:34, could be seen heaving the ball after time expired. It appeared to hit the 24-second clock, then ricocheted and hit a cameraman in the head. The heave was in the direction of Dallas' basket, not the Blazers.

It helps us move away from artificial ingredients from our products.”
Obama recently announced he was postponing a decision until after the 2012 elections on the much-studied proposal. Environmentalists oppose the project, but several unions support it, putting the president in the uncomfortable position of having to choose between customary political allies.
The House passed the new Lake Erie usage bill, 59-38, this time with Kasich's approval. But Democrats and environmentalists objected to the bill because it does not adequately protect Lake Erie and its tributaries.
"Bargain-hunting was the key motivation as 90 percent of consumers planning to shop said they were looking for themselves - not holiday gifts," the International Council of Shopping Centers said in a report.

On the timeouts, here's my first two questions, and Fickell's answer.
Paul votes against resolutions honoring Boy Scout troops and civil rights leaders. He voted against a congressional medal for former President Ronald Reagan because of its $30,000 cost. He has voted against constitutional bans on same-sex marriage and flag burning, believing in individual expression. And he opposes farm subsidies that benefit constituents in his rural Texas district because he wants the free enterprise system to work.
As a result, Phoenix police leaders Thursday ordered a full review of the department's off-duty work program. The program, which the department provides as a community service, provides uniformed off-duty officers to guard construction sites, serve as extra protection against shoplifters at stores and work as requested by private businesses in thousands of other assignments. Officers can earn more than $40 per hour. The program provides $30 million in extra wages annually to officers, Public Safety Manager Jack Harris said.

We have laws against bullying, and criminal and civil suits over suicidal outcomes when people use the Internet to say terrible things about other people. All are efforts to make life in America sane, peaceful and calm. Laws usually have that goal. They should focus on keeping the peace by discouraging violence.
Another explanation comes from Indiana University sociologist Brian Powell, who led a research project on the issue funded by the Russell Sage Foundation; Powell credits what might be called the "Aunt Martha effect." Powell's surveys found that an increasing number of Americans say they have gay friends or relatives, and those who know gay people are more likely to favor gay marriage. The change, Powell says, wasn't that people acquired new gay relatives; rather, their gay relatives were more likely to be open about their sexuality. And it turns out that once you've learned that your beloved Aunt Martha is a lesbian, you're more likely to feel sympathetic toward gay people in general.

Generations ago, homes across America's Tornado Alley often came equipped with storm cellars, usually a small concrete bunker buried in the backyard. Although some of those remain, they are largely relics of a bygone era. And basements are less common than they used to be, leaving many people with no refuge except maybe a bathtub or a room deep inside the house.
""A really important thing to know about bee-keeping in urban settings is that 90 percent of stings come from wasps," Red-Laird said. "Bees only sting defensively when something gets into their hive or if you accidentally squish one."

It reminds Baldwin of his childhood days in Massapequa, a suburban town about an hour northeast of New York City on Long Island. Born in 1960, Daniel was the third of six children born to Alexander Baldwin, a high school social studies teacher and football coach, and Carol, a homemaker. Oldest sibling Beth arrived in 1955, and Alexander Jr. (known then as Xander) followed in 1958. After Daniel came Billy (1963), then a sister, Jane, in 1965.

A Turkmen energy official told the AP this week that third pipeline to China is already in the works, which will enable Turkmenistan to meet the commitments made in 2011 to gradually boost natural gas deliveries to China to 65 billion cubic meters annually.
I also argued that "fewer children would be raised by a married mother and father" because we would teach that having both is unnecessary. Mr. Rodricks responds by saying many children are already raised within other family structures. Yet the question is not what family structures exist, but which is optimal. Social science research shows children do best when raised by their biological mother and father who are married to one another.
The lawsuit is Midei's main recourse against a scandal that has cost him his seven-figure salary, Maryland medical license and reputation. His troubles began in 2009, when St. Joseph warned 600 patients that their stent surgeries might have been unnecessary. More than 200 have since filed lawsuits against the cardiologist. He has said the ordeal left him unable to find work, nearly suicidal and in treatment for substance abuse for a time.

The camera simply follows Gorewitz as she wanders around the Traditions Unit, chatting with staff and fellow residents, and ruminating about her life. She's happy at times, sad and despairing at others, yet the words she uses are the same regardless of her mood.

Eager to see what other delights the desert might hold, we decided our next stop should be Bonnie Springs Ranch, a reproduction of an 1880s Western mining town in nearby Blue Diamond. Yet as tempting as it sounded to witness a (simulated) shootout in the street or take a tour of a wax museum of famous frontiersmen, it wasn't quite tempting enough to merit $20 a head.
He had to. There were other runners in the neighborhood as he neared the finish line. Joey Hughes of USC was second in 45.27 and Bryan Miller of Texas A&M third in 45.29. Only the top two finishers advanced automatically, although Miller would qualify on time.
The Bravo network's reality show "Being Bobby Brown" was undoubtedly exploitative; the folks at the network must have rubbed their hands in glee when Brown actually gave them access to the unsanitized inner world of one of the world's foremost divas. The thing is, as much as some fans cringed at the unvarnished depiction of Whitney, her earthy humor and no-nonsense attitude also endeared her to many. It was clear that the woman being shown wasn't who Brown had turned her into but was something closer to the real thing. And there was something grittily appealing about that gritty woman. You pulled for her to make it.
