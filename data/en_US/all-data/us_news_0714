They are hearing it from me, they are hearing it from the assistant coaches, and at the end of the week when we summarize the entire week, they hear it again.”
With no disrespect to Majerus, I don't know why SMU believes it's the right move to go for a 64-year-old coach with a history of heart-health issues to take on a major project that will require several years of heavy lifting. If this was an easy move-in job -- sign a contract and inherit a successful program -- things would be different. But Majerus only has so much time left in his coaching career, and I don't think he'd be enthusiastic about taking on another reconstruction challenge.

In the Employee Benefit Research Institute's annual retirement confidence survey, 37 percent of respondents said they intend to work past 65.

You know that parade downtown for the veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan. It's a wonderful thing. But I think it would have been better if it had been a parade for all wars. The World War II veterans never got a parade. They never got a bonus. They didn't get a memorial until nearly 60 years later. So if there was ever a forgotten war, it was World War II. And there's not a lot of them left.

øIt is certainly in the interest of both industries to do so. IIHS has been one of the only voices to dismiss suggestions that cellphones are causing far more people to crash and to suggest anti-texting and handheld cellphone laws have had little effect.

Ms. Spacek initially aspired to be a music star. At 17 she took two guitars to New York, where she was introduced to the entertainer's life by her cousin, actor Rip Torn, and his wife, theater star Geraldine Page. After some dead-end music gigs—serenading diners at a joint owned by boxer Rocky Graziano, releasing a novelty song about John Lennon—Ms. Spacek followed a trail that led to modeling, television and, eventually, "Badlands."

"Finally," Gortat said. "The last three or four games, I was struggling. I came out more aggressive.

"Upon whom did Abraham Lincoln have to depend but himself?" young Rosie asked her classmates. "Upon whom did Fred Douglass have to depend but himself? Upon whom did Booker T. Washington have to depend but himself? These are lives that have been the inspiration of many a lad who knew not whence his next meal was coming.

Holder said others in his department have discussed Fast and Furious with top U.S. and Mexico officials, and that he has made some "personnel changes" at ATF headquarters.
Hospitals can whine all they want about decreasing Medicare reimbursements, but the truth is that when the elderly get sick, the docs and the hospitals get paid. They get paid on a reasonable schedule without begging or collection companies. They get paid consistent amounts for specified treatments.

The narrator was immediately suspicious of the boy's parents, Nelly ("a courtesan and a murderess," easy to see both "in her way of walking, her calves speaking to me, her shoulder blades") and Vasily (gemologist or jewelist, "or whatever he was," into whose eyes the narrator looks "to see the images of however many corpses had imprinted themselves at the back of his iris"). Their great wealth -- real gold fixtures in the bathroom -- seemed inexplicable when the narrator showed up at their gated compound to interview as a tutor for Petya, their 11-year-old son. The couple's money, he tells Petya in the retrospective account that makes up the body of the novel, was "certainly not earned, as your mother tried to make me believe" in mutually contradictory explanations. This account is set up as a series of commentaries despite the narrator's revulsion at commentary, which he terms "execrable in itself."

Beyond the various and sundry sex scenes, the one scene you'll remember most belongs to Mulligan, when Sissy sings a molasses-slow version of "New York, New York" in a small club. McQueen, a former artist, keeps the camera on her face in close-up as she sings, the lyrics serving as some sort of catharsis for her. You will likely find it magnetic or annoying; I found it a little of both.

The 82-foot-long zipline doesn't compete with those strung across the jungles of Costa Rica and Jamaica, and alone it probably won't be enough to get passengers on board. But when you add the outdoor Central Park with a live tropical garden featuring 12,000 vines, bananas, bromeliads and bamboo; balcony cabins overlooking the park or a lively outdoor "boardwalk;" an intimate Art Deco-styled restaurant featuring tasting menus designed by one of America's hottest young chefs and a levitating bar, it's clear that Oasis of the Seas is far more than a supersized version of Royal Caribbean's other ships.

"Limahuli" means "turning hands." The garden celebrates indigenous people's ties to the land, as well as the islands' endangered plant heritage. Its tour trail passes terraced taro (kalo) ponds, framed in lava rock at least 700 years ago and irrigated by canals diverting water from Limahuli Stream. The terraces - lo'i kalo - were part of an apupua'a, the traditional unit of land management: a pie slice with its apex in the mountains and its broad end in the sea. The system survived on Kauai into the mid-1900s.

2Old-fashioned glass: As sipping glasses don't hold ice, when you want your whiskey on the rocks you'll need something that can hold the extra volume. A lowball glass (also called an old-fashioned or a rocks glass) is good for on-the-rocks drinks and also for margaritas, caipirinhas and carbonated drinks like vodka tonics - if you don't want to use a straw.

The forest represents almost half the city's parkland, but receives one 0.5 percent of the city's annual recreation budget. The city and the conservancy together contribute about $1 million a year, way short of the $2.6 million a year experts say we should be spending just on invasive species removal and prevention. There's no main entrance to Forest Park, no obvious place to go to find a map or report a problem. This spring, city ecologists pooh-poohed the work of a Linfield College professor who says young trees in the park are dying at an alarming rate.

We pulled up to Octopus Resort in a driving rain, so we didn't get the customary serenade from the staff. No matter, rain or sunshine, Octopus is a cheery, efficiently run place in the Yasawa chain, about 2 1/2 hours from Nadi by ferry. The resort has 34 guest rooms in lodges and bungalows, plus 18 beds in two dorms. It attracts singles, couples, families with children and retired folk. Meals are served communally.

Portland detectives Nick (David Giuntoli) and Hank (Russell Hornsby) arrive at the cabin, where Portland actor Robert Blanche is back, after his debut appearance in "Tarantellla." Fans of the Portland-filmed "Leverage" may remember Blanche played a Boston cop named Bonanno on that show, which was supposedly set in Boston.

Needs work: When it comes to running guys down from sideline to sideline like Ray Lewis did in his prime, Hightower doesn't have the acceleration and top-end speed to do it consistently, and he may struggle if asked to cover man-to-man.

And it's not a coincidence that many of the areas with high unemployment among blacks are areas where there was once a thriving manufacturing industry.
Politically, this is a no-lose situation for the governor.

His potential Republican opponent in the 2012 gubernatorial race already backs the bills, too, so who is going to criticize him, except for the narrow group of developers fighting any meaningful change to the historic redevelopment or low-income housing tax credits?

And finally, allowing people to participate in projects like the expansion of Seagirt Marine Terminal at the Port of Baltimore and the redevelopment of the State Center office complex doesn't amount to turning the country over to the Chinese or anyone else. The people who take advantage of this program are putting themselves and their entire families on a path to become American citizens. If the firms completing these projects sought financing through traditional means, the money could have come from investors anywhere. This way, they are selling ownership stakes in their ventures to people who will live here and who will have a tremendous incentive to make sure the developments' job creation potential is realized. Their legal status in this country depends on it.

Yet Rogan also focuses on faith. Early on in "The Lifeboat," Grace — the name is no accident — says she thought of the disappeared ship "as I have often thought of God — responsible for everything, but out of sight and maybe annihilated, splintered on the rocks of his own creation." So it comes as no surprise that the only minister aboard the lifeboat makes an early exit, a loser in a possibly rigged lottery to select those who must heave themselves overboard to lighten the load.

Monaco art dealer David Nahmad says he might bid on "The Scream" if the action stays around $80 million, though not if it soars higher. It's a fraught investment, he says, arguing that the name "Munch" is not as instantly recognizable as others and the resale value is not guaranteed: "If I have the choice to buy a Picasso or a Munch, I would prefer to buy a Picasso," he says. "Everybody knows everything about Picasso, Matisse, Cézanne, Monet. If you go to somebody in South America and say there's a Munch to buy, he'll say, 'Who's he?'"

But the film, released last June, scored where it mattered most -- with the 5,532 voters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Although almost every film producer and distributor passed on making Bigelow's film, financed independently for $11 million, "The Hurt Locker" was among last year's most critically acclaimed releases, and won any number of key awards in the weeks leading up to the Oscars ceremony. To win the best picture prize, it had to get past "Avatar," the first feature from Cameron (Bigelow's former husband) since his 1997 disaster epic "Titanic" swept the Oscars. Cameron's futuristic thriller, the most expensive production ever, was awarded with Academy Awards for visual effects, art direction and cinematography.

Second, timing: The United States would be seen as dangerously weak if it is mired in Afghanistan at the same time it is retreating from a stalemate in Iraq. Moreover, making good on unkept promises to improve the lives of the Afghan people is both a moral and a geopolitical imperative at a time when the West should be offering a meaningful alternative to fanatical Islamism. The setbacks in Afghanistan are fairly blamed on the Bush administration's decision to attempt nation-building on the cheap. It then slashed aid in 2006 and diverted military and intelligence resources to the worsening situation in Iraq. This year, the U.S. gave just $1.8 billion in direct "operations aid" to the Afghan government; the other 82% of U.S. aid was military. Afghanistan needs massive civilian economic aid now, and $10 billion a year -- what we spend in a month in Iraq -- would be a start. The Europeans have been right to criticize the United States for shortchanging nation-building, but they in turn must be persuaded to order their troops into combat. And the so-called donor nations, including the wealthy Arab states, must be shamed into paying what they've promised -- now, when Kabul needs it most.

The scare over salmonella-tainted tomatoes and other recent outbreaks of food-borne diseases are real problems. Paul, as you note here and in your book, the growth of large-scale farming and longer, more complex supply chains increases the risk that bacteria will work their way into the produce supply. The problem is analogous to the development of refrigerated rail cars, which made it possible to get fresh milk to cities, but also let pathogens from one cow spread throughout the pooled milk. The solution then was pasteurization. With produce, however, there is no "kill step." Once bacteria make their way into our fresh vegetables, we're somewhat stuck with them.

ELYRIA, Ohio -- After lead poisoning almost killed her young son last year, Chalene Mudd said her calls to government officials for a solution went unanswered.
5. Sessions had an aggressive fourth quarter. He had struggled most of the game in either playing at the right tempo and playing with enough aggressiveness. Then suddenly, things clicked. His 10 points on four-of-eight shooting featured him throwing down a fast-break dunk, shooting two running floaters, converting on a layup and an And1. For someone who has struggled finding the right balance between playing aggressively and playing at a proper pace, this game marked a huge step for Sessions' growth.

Have we, as a nation, developed enough technology? Are we done with exploring? If your answer to these questions is yes, then the cut makes sense, as does the resulting step away from U.S. leadership in planetary exploration. But I sincerely hope your answer is a resounding "no." Space exploration is no fantasy; it is something our nation does at a level other nations can only envy, and it has paid us back a thousandfold with incredible discoveries, big dreams and inspiration for new generations.

øA: I am almost always bullish on real estate as a business. I have known many people who have made great sums of money with savvy investments.

“It was just different,” he says. “The whole idea of a procedural — which by now is ubiquitous, but you didn’t see then. Shooting in New York, which nobody was doing, and really articulating the dirty, dangerous underbelly, which still existed. You know, it wasn’t the ‘Sex and the City’ New York then, outside of maybe Fifth Avenue. It was still the ‘Midnight Cowboy’ New York — and I quite enjoyed it.”

As they have grown in popularity, dollar stores have not been resting on their laurels. They have been upgrading their stores with better lighting, adding more food and fresh produce to the shelves, and some have even begun rolling out things like photo books and music downloads.

Sigler said she'll have to exchange all the baby clothes she bought for larger sizes.
The breakfast sandwich almost doesn't fit in the square takeout box. A massive buttermilk biscuit holds eggs, pepper jack and Canadian bacon – cheddar or bacon are also available. The sweet, moist biscuit is almost indistinguishable from cake, making the sandwich truly decadent. Thick strings of cheese pull out of the sandwich with each bite, and the Canadian bacon adds some salty chew. Over-hard eggs are fluffy, not overcooked as they are in most casual breakfast spots. I make it maybe halfway through this beast.
predicting that Brad Boyes would return to form last year, my predictions days are over. With that said, Berglund showed a lot in the second half of last season and again at the World Championships. If he doesn't have a good season in 2011-12, I give up trying to figure him out.

Langley faced resentencing in the Gray case in 1994. A jury again delivered a death sentence, but the Supreme Court in 2000 found that the judge improperly instructed jurors that they could only choose death or life in prison with the possibility of parole as punishments. The jurors should have been allowed to consider life in prison without the possibility of parole, the high court ruled in overturning the death sentence.
Few cars flow off of Luther, yet the pesky traffic signal gives that side street a green light for roughly 15 seconds every minute. It's "a big gas and time waster" for East 55th motorists, the Willowick commuter e-mailed. (He'd know, too, given his experience wasting both at this spot.)
"I went to a specialist on Monday and he said as long as I could take the pain I was cleared to play,"' said Cody Ratermann, who was hurt in a 47-0 loss to Springfield Sacred Heart-Griffin on Oct. 14.

They automatically think that my back is in half and I'm in a wheelchair, but the fractures are minute and they're away from the spine, so I was lucky."

The technical polish and sonic weight that this orchestra commands - the burnished sound of its string sections, the tireless and impeccable heroism of the brass - have long been the stuff of legend, even if local audiences have had to rely on recordings to hear them. And those qualities were everywhere in evidence through both programs.
