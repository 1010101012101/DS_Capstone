In music hip-hop and rap are not only valued above blue grass, but they is now valued above the classical greats, and certainly never mocked and disparaged in the same way.

One day I had dreamed up so many different ideas that I couldn’t stand by and not do anything about it. So I in 2011 I put the wheels in motion to start my own boutique with a spin. I already knew the way I would do business would be in the homes of fashionable women in a party atmosphere, but the tough part was coming up with a name. A name is everything for a company.

Long before YouTube, I remember watching a video on television on one of those animal programs that show us how clever animals can be. A camcorder had been set up in a kitchen, its lens pointed toward a countertop on which was placed a cookie jar. Nothing happened for more than a couple of minutes. And right at the moment when boredom began to creep in, and I reached for the remote, a small mouse scurried into view. I watched in awe as he sped up the side of the clear glass jar, knocked off the lid, and dragged out a cookie four times his size. The clip wasn’t about art of course. After all who would have thought the idea of running surveillance on a mouse could be the makings for great art? Bruce Nauman I guess.

It is always convenient to argue from the extreme -- take the one example of your philosophy that seems uniquely successful and ignore the thousands of flops. But Ries is being coy here. He's too smart not to know that what made Amazon a huge success was not "branding," it was an amazing and ground-breaking operations and customer service system developed by a visionary leader.

Danny is doing really well, he is loving his calling as the Young Men's president. I think it is the perfect calling for him even though he is gone a lot. He is also excited to do some fun races including the warrior dash which will take him through some obstacle courses, mud holes jumping through fire etc! Everything continues to go well with his job which we are grateful. Right now he is making some cars for a family pinewood derby our ward is having next week. He is so fun and creative, he made one for Mason and another one for our family. Mason loved working on it with him :) And Danny is so great and patient as he teaches Mason and Lily to do things themselves. He is amazing!

The problem is that in this pursuit, this particular pursuit of science, including the books that we mentioned earlier, The Tao of Physics and TheDancing Wu Li Masters, even when spirituality is recognized within the materialist worldview, God is seen only in the immanent aspect of divinity. What that means is: you have said that there is only one reality.

These chocolate chip pancakes are right at the top of my list of favorite ways to use discard starter. They do require a little bit of advance planning because there's an overnight sponge to be made, but they're worth the effort. The pancakes are on the thin side - not as thin as crepes, but also not super thick and fluffy. They have just enough tang to set them apart from more traditional pancakes, I loved the depth of flavor. And of course I added chocolate because I always look for an excuse to eat it, but these would also be good plain. The recipe makes a lot of pancakes (especially if, like me, you're the only one in the house eating them), but leftovers freeze perfectly. Oh, and if you're not a pancake person, you can use this exact same batter to make waffles too! Either way, the recipe is a winner.

There certainly wouldn't be any need for this (admittedly pretty cool and scary) elite police force going around shooting the Emo kids and burning the Mona Lisa. No one would be Emo, and no one would care one way or another about the Mona Lisa. Frankly, I might almost be tempted to give up the Mona Lisa for a world without Emo. Don't you think it would be a really scary movie that played on that temptation, the one that makes me want to play along?

I picked this smock up from Boss Unlimited Vintage here in Denver. I should say I more swooped it out from under them. I was in their warehouse one day visiting where they have 10x more clothes than what is in their store and I saw this on a rack. I started drooling and begged and pleaded to get it. Their price tag on it said $7, but I would have paid $50. They are friends and gave in. Yay for me!!!

Our 11th President, James Knox Polk, is one of our first really forgotten presidents. He's also one of my favorites. Considered to be the first "dark horse" candidate, he was the last "strong" (for however you would like to define that) president before the Civil War. A fellow Tennessean, he became close friends with Andrew Jackson. He served in the House of Representatives and then went back to Tennessee to serve as its governor. An aged Andrew Jackson made it known that Polk was his candidate and at the Democratic Convention, finally, on the ninth ballot, Polk was the nominee.
Also this week, I’ve received our first paycheck since I started consciously prepping. Now funds are tight, so I wanted to make sure that I maximized the usefulness of what money I had available. I’ve been a coupon clipper for years. I’ve even put them in my purse. Today I remembered to pull them out and use them. I took the amount I saved and put it towards an extra bag of rice, and a collection of condiments (mayo, ketchup, mustard, salt, and garlic). This may seem like an odd place to start, but I do have logic.
Phil 2:1-4 (Phi) Now if you have known anything of Christ’s encouragement and of his reassuring love; if you have known something of the fellowship of his Spirit, and of compassion and deep sympathy, do make my joy complete–live together in harmony, live together in love, as though you had only one mind and one spirit between you. Never act from motives of rivalry or personal vanity, but in humility think more of each other than you do of yourselves. None of you should think only of his own affairs, but consider other people’s interest also.

Sadly, the “undercover dictatorship” Benjamin Rush foretold is not simply a homegrown one we can root out from the inside, as it were. Although the American Medical Association (AMA) and the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) behave as if they are at the top of this pyramid of secret power relations, they only represent the tip of the iceberg. The United States government and American corporate lobbying groups may appear to be behind the FDA’s shameless pandering to the interests of the drug companies, when in fact it is transnational corporations and organizations that are actually pulling the strings. The United States no longer enjoys global economic and cultural hegemony. We are now embedded in an international playing field where multinational and transnational organizations like the chemical company Imperial Chemical Industries which owns Zeneca and which we exposed as the originator of Breast Cancer Awareness Month in our last newsletter, or the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) have power and influence that overshadows the US or any other particular government or nation-state. These larger organizations blur the divisions traditionally drawn between public and private institutions, insofar as their agendas and mandates are consistent with global economic imperatives which do not account for the self-proclaimed sovereignty of any particular nation-state’s constitution or laws above its own. For example, the United States may soon no longer be able to allow the over-the-counter sale of dietary supplements if the World Trade Organization decides it violates our membership agreement to do so. (This process known as Codex Alimentarius is already far enough along, that prescription-only-vitamins are already making it onto the market and herbs like ephedra have been classified as illegal drugs).
For the non gunnnies, I am going to try to make this as clear as possible. I'm going to be pumping out a LOT of information here, and some of it is going to be mathy, and technical, and gun geeky.

I was delighted to see that our old friend Mike Smith, from SASucks fame, has started blogging again. I have taken the liberty of reproducing one of his latest articles published today, as it has a direct bearing on this post:
These words of Jesus are dominated by action words, imperative commands. Love. Do good. Bless. Pray. Turn. Do not stop. Give. Do not demand. Our lives demonstrate to others a reaction. Jesus doesn’t say, “Don’t react.” No, he is quite content that we do react. He is concerned mostly with the nature of our reaction.
Tika was initially to make Plecing Kangkung (a popular water spinach dish from Lombok). But, her plan turned 180 degrees since she had no tomatoes as one of crucial ingredients in making Plecing. She finally decided to come up with Rujak Kangkung. It is almost the same with Plecing Kangkung actually (except for some of the ingredients) – the sambal (chili sauce) in Rujak Kangkung doesn’t use tomato and limo lime. Some people in Kuningan, West Java, sell Rujak Kangkung that they claimed the dish is originally from Kuningan. Rujak Kangkung is worth to try as the water spinach tastes cruncy and the sambal is really rich in flavors :D

Michael Faraday formulated that electromotive force (EMF) produced around a closed path is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through any surface bounded by that path. In practice, this means that an electric current will be induced in any closed circuit when the magnetic flux through a surface bounded by the conductor changes. This applies whether the field itself changes in strength or the conductor is moved through it.Pass an electromagnetic field (such as the one generated by the Sun's plasma - ionized gases) through a closed circuit (anything that can conduct electricity be it steel, aluminum or copper) and an electric current is created. That is how your car battery is charged by an alternator. That is how a coal/gas/nuclear power plant works.

These homes might be worth a fraction of the peak prices today, we have seen 60-70%+ declines at the top end of the market, but the homes may still be worth substantial sums and not be subject to a mortgage.

Important questions have also been raised as to why NOAA objected to the adoption of a new type of sonar, the Ocean Acoustic Waveguide Remote Sensing (OAWRS), which was developed by scientists from MIT and Northeastern University. The OAWRS system allegedly can map out a 120 kilometer radius, in four directions and in only 70 seconds while trawling surveys usually take about two weeks. That could be a massive time and money save. NOAA even conducted a peer review, concluding that OAWRS worked very well and would likely become the next big thing in biomass assessment. But when it came time to adopt this new system, NOAA stalled for unknown reasons. Why fail to adopt cutting edge science?

It was a return to another era in NYC politics at the Museum of City of New York Tuesday night when politicians, journalists and historians gathered to assess the meaning, the impact and the successes and failures of the administration of John Vliet Lindsay, 103rd Mayor of the City of New York from 1966-1973. Mayor Lindsay (or “Lindslee” as he was chided by many disaffected New Yorkers) came in brimming with ideas, energy and enthusiasm, and cadres of young activists seeking to revitalize the political scene and New York City under his leadership. The event was moderated by Sam Roberts of the New York Times (and editor of the companion volume to the new exhibit at the Museum of the City of New York, “America’s Mayor: John V. Lindsay and the Reinvention of New York.”) Roberts opened the symposium by asking to identify audience members who had worked in the Lindsay administration: a forest of hands filled the air. This lent a certain clubby quality to the event. In addition, the panel included former Congressman Major Owens, former Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum, who held positions in the administration and Jay Kriegel, Mr. Lindsay’s Chief of Staff. They were all vocally supportive of the energy and vision of Mr. Lindsay’s mayoralty, acknowledging that the strikes and widespread political unrest were circumstances beyond his control that may have played a role in derailing many of the administration’s efforts at implementing new ideas. Jerry Kretchmer, former Manhattan Assemblyman, campaign aide to Robert F. Kennedy and environmental commissioner for the Mayor, in the audience, took umbrage with suggestions that it was a failed administration. They took risks, made many advances, but were hobbled by the political climate, the unions, and other issues beyond their control. But at least they were willing to try new things.

Hulda’s voice in this fiction piece is in the first person, while other characters are in third-person. Kirkpatrick leads us through the lives of not just Hulda Klager, but also the people Hulda influenced. The characters are lovable and the book impeccable in its flow and readability. It’s an unusual fiction piece as it’s based on the story of Hulda Klager. Today her lilac gardens are still open to tourists and it only costs an entrance fee of two dollars.
Since your direct reports can develop a way to work around your less attractive behavioral aspects and that it might not be in their best interest to give you some very honest and direct feedback, the view of an experienced executive coach might be very helpful in becoming the best leader you can be.
The reason for this is that I don’t like the shape and sound of these words as they come out of his mouth. Why, I have no idea. Nonetheless, it’s like hearing nails down a blackboard combined with a feeling of faint nausea. Ergo, it’s quite reasonable of me to impose this ban and he has come to accept this over the years.
The group was made up of two girls and a guy, which is what they originally called themselves when they assembled the group in the summer of 1958. The two girls were Gretchen Christopher, born 29 February 1940, and Barbara Ellis, who was just nine days older than Gretchen. The guy was Gary Troxel, born 28 November 1939. All three lived in Olympia, Washington.

We planned a few jobs today – just to keep ‘Chance’ up to scratch. The weather promised to be warm so a few touch up paint jobs could be done. However, when Oscar decided to surface from his pit (about 10:30!) he could hardly walk. His back legs, very weak these days anyway, seemed not to be functioning very well but on further inspection it was his left leg and foot where there was something wrong. Detailed inspection found a very swollen foot.

I’ll never understand how this character was so popular. She was so judgy and walked around like she was better than everyone else with her stupid abstinence ring that she probably got for $3.99 in a Claire’s sales bin. Plus she was such a hypocrite. She got all pissy wissy with bf Spinner for having a sexual past before he knew her. But then turned around and posted sexy photos of herself on the interwebs to get money for new Spirit Squad uniforms. If you’re getting $$ for your goods, it’s called p-tution, just sayin.’ She then started dating the kid who took the pics and sold her out to a pedophile, so she’s obviously not Mensa material. During a snowboarding trip she got roofie raped and turned 800 shades of crazy and started hitting on Mr. Simpson then accused him of molesting her. Thank God her scrawny butt was shipped off to Africa.

Just a Flesh Wound (10) – Dismembered a Brawler
I'm interested in a lot of things: writing, photography, music (especially music), science, religion, politics. . . gardening, bar tending. I'll stop there. You may as know that I am staunchly "Independent" politically speaking. Not apt to change anytime soon. I still support Ron Paul throughout the primary season.
With so many people tuning into these programs, that’s more and more people becoming informed about the issue of human trafficking.
In a recent blog post for my New Year's Resolution (which was the resolution to have more resolve), I used this line "we're resolving to be bold, professionally (so much I want to do visually, narratively, weirdly, fiercely... gloves off, literary handcuffs gone)" and it felt like a dangerous confession. I was wondering if any of my readers -- many of whom are literary writers and poets -- would wonder what I meant by "literary handcuffs gone". There were a number of responses to the post on Facebook, but no one mentioned literary handcuffs or what I could possibly mean by the fact that I'd shed them.
When we stare at a blank sheet of paper, we often think, “What am I going to write?” A few minutes later, it becomes, “Oh my goodness, I can’t think of anything to write!” And several minutes later, it turns into something like, “Write, dangnabit! Write! Write! WRITE!”
The Koran and hadith contain countless eulogies to violence and jihad in the name of Islam and Allah. The New Testament simply does not. And even the violence in the Old Testament, of which there is a lot, is not carried out for God and it is rarely God Himself who sanctifies these many acts of violence. In fact, most of the examples of violence contained are simply parts of various Old Testament narratives (some historical, some fictional). So the Muslims and Leftists who have jumped on this case of 'Christian terrorism' should question their own motives first.

In my researches I discovered that The Radleys is being repackaged by Canongate Walker and is marketed as a young adult novel. As I said when I reviewed The Moonstone Legacy a while back the age limit for YA is not very clear. Whereas I would be happy with a ten-year-old reading The Moonstone Legacy I’m not sure what minimum age I would slap on this one. I know it all depends on the kid. The press release says that it's a "story about growing up, first and foremost" but I think I’d like my kid to have done a bit of growing up before passing this on. There’s swearing as well as, as the TV announcers like to say, “scenes of a sexual nature” which although not exactly graphic are still there.

So courtly love holds up a woman as the virginal Mary, but only for purposes of conquest. The accusation of witchcraft colors woman as the deceptive, lustful Eve who is vindictive and in cahoots with devils. Whether she is good like Mary or bad like Eve, she is still just a woman, rationally inferior (Kelly 12).

Andy was being all Christmascroogey for a minute there, but once we got the Christmas tree, he stopped complaining about all the "damn Christmas music" and "freakin' Christmas decorations" everywhere. We decided to go to Toys R Us and get two presents for Toys for Tots: one for a girl and one for a boy. Andy declared that his present would be better because boy toys are cooler, and I was all UM. LOL, NO, because girls have dress up things and dolls and pretend makeup and motherfuckin' Barbie, who runs the entire country. (No shit, you guys. She's a police officer, a teacher, a doctor, a streetwalker. Bitch is busy.)

I know, I know, I know. I know deep down and intimately that life is not fair. That there is no guarantee of reward for hard work, and that despite what my mother tried to teach us, there is nothing that guarantees consequences for irresponsible actions. I've known this for a long time, and I was slapped around by it when Gabe died and yet I still find myself clinging to the idea that the universe is an essentially fair place.

This past Shabbat, I ate the most delicious Asian-style noodle salad I’ve eaten in a long time. My sister-in-law Brynn had added her own twist to an Asian recipe by adding, of all things, tehina, to the sauce. It’s a combination that really works and gives the salad a wonderful depth. I suppose if you don’t want to use the tehina or can’t be bothered to make it, then you can use about 4 tablespoons of peanut butter instead. But I highly recommend this version, which I have dubbed East Meets East Noodle Salad, as it brings together ingredients from the Far and Middle East into one dish.

Patent Reform Now Part of Snappy-Sounding Agenda - as part of a rebranding strategy, patent reform is being packaged in the Senate as part of a larger "competitiveness agenda" (or "innovation agenda," depending who you ask) that includes bills to expand/renew research and development tax credits, advance job-training and worksharing, develop a Clean Energy Deployment Administration and strengthen cybersecurity. According to Sen. Reid, first up is completion of a bill to modernize air traffic control system, followed by the patent reform bill (link 1) (link2). Meanwhile, Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) has indicated that he will be taking the lead for the GOP in the House efforts to draft a companion patent reform bill.

Bolo Yeung for me is a classic badass villain.... but oddly I really have only ever known him from one single movie... Bloodsport. Sure he was in Enter the Dragon, the film that helped him don the Bolo name, but we all know that's really the Bruce Lee show. He was a rather nasty baddie in another JCVD film Double Impact, but I only saw that for the first time when I reviewed it here on my blog last year. Other than that, my entire image of him has really been from Bloodsport... the uber-serious, cocky monster that obliterates Ogre from Revenge of the Nerds. SPOILER ALERT~~!

I went in this morning around 7 and Randy was there to meet me which was really nice and comforting as well. The nurse called me back and hooked me up to an IV, I met the anesthesiologist and Dr. Matchett again, and told me they were going to put me out so I should say bye. I just remember talking to my mom about my first grade class at Royerton and the cute cards they made me. He said, “You should start feeling very sleeping in 30 seconds or so.” That’s all I remember. I was out!

Tsubaki gets even more jealous when a classmate Ogata – a popular, athletic, handsome guy – asks out Urabe. Up until now no one else has uttered a word to Urabe, so it’s understandable Tsubaki is possessive. That, and since it’s not obvious or apparent that they’re a couple when in class. Urabe’s test for both Ogata and Tsubaki is another masterpiece of effective fanservice done right, and the fact that it just happened to be a windy day when Urabe decided to go commando was a little karmic justice for giving Tsubaki a sleepless night.

But even though the market for vampire-related products is exploding, when did it become a good idea to insert a sinister, cross-dressing monster into a book for preschoolers who need regular convincing that there are no monsters under their beds? If the target market for this bizarre thing is moms who read Twilight, or the swooning teenagers who might get the tongue-in-cheek humor (if you can call it that), then market it to them. Display the book next to the dark-hued covers at Books-a-Million. But please don’t pretend like it’s for kids. Don’t recommend it for ages 5 and up. I guarantee that my almost 5-year-old would not find the fang-faced man funny. Frankly, he would find him terrifying. If you have to explain to a kid why a scary thing is funny, then that means it is not funny to them. Simple.

All we needed were some mini cupcake patties, straws (the kind with a spoon on the end), paint and a ribbon. Our first step was to dip the rims of the cupcake patties in paint. Once they were dry I snipped a hole in the middle of each one and cut three straws on an angle so they could be easily threaded. In hind-sight I wouldn't cut the straws again, I would just cut the patties twice in a cross shape and thread the flat straw end through.

They were almost twice as likely to have post-traumatic stress disorder as young adults.

The freedom of the mind, the source of every generous and rational sentiment, was destroyed by the habits of credulity and submission; and the monk, contracting the vices of a slave, devoutly followed the faith and passions of his ecclesiastical tyrant.

It is here in Genesis 2:18 that we have the first appearance in the Bible of the expression “not good”. This is the first thing in the history of the universe that God declares as not good. It is not good for man to be alone, to be all by himself. Everything up to this point had been prepared for life, and certainly for the life of humanity. But suddenly there is but one human and that’s not good. Man needs somebody specifically suited for him so God says he will make a suitable helper.

The existential curriculum coalesced in my imagination when I was trying to arrive at a more methodical, “not-rushing,” self-regulating, better-paced way to move through the syllabus as a coherent narrative with a beginning, middle and end. The existential curriculum had roots in the realization that, as is my nature, I had been pushing through recent semesters at a high metabolic level, putting forth one intense idea after another without respite. I became anxious that, even though my intention was to challenge them, the students were having trouble keeping up. Conceding that it sounded somewhat “hokey,” I told them, “We are all on the same journey.” This was a metaphor I had actually learned from them; they approved of my epiphany and began to relax somewhat.

People are worried that the country will run out of oil, or that the Middle East will cut us off completely. Let’s forget for a moment that the people who run that business really like money. Wouldn’t they be cutting their own throats if they quit selling their precious oil? Besides, that just might be what the country needs. It might force us to come up with an energy plan is more safe for the environment. We can do that. We’re pretty smart people.
Here are my gloves. I bought them when I was getting a new pair of shoes last fall. I had been meaning to get thin, fingertip-less gloves for a while, so I grabbed some while I was thinking about it.

Gloves without fingertips so people can operate their touchscreen smartphones. I would be offended if someone told me I was wearing texting gloves. I’m not one of those people who is attached to their cellphone, texting all day and all night.

But here the superstition of materialism breaks down. Our five senses encourage us to accept that there are objects “out there,” forests and rivers, atoms and quarks. However, at the frontiers of physics, where Nature becomes very small, matter breaks down and then vanishes. Here, the act of measuring changes what we see; every observer turns out to be woven into what he observes. This is the universe already known to spirituality, where passive observation gives way to active participation, and we discover that we are part of the fabric of creation. The result is enormous power and freedom.

A recent study published in the journal Solid Earth, which used data from over 6,000 earthquakes, confirms the expectation of larger quakes in closer proximity to the Fukushima Daiichi site. In part, this conclusion is predicated on the discovery that the earthquake that initiated last year’s disaster caused a seismic fault close to the nuclear plant to reactivate.
I know that this restricted female life was the reality for the time, and certainly not restricted to this book; however, it's something that I noticed much more here than in the other Austen novels I've read in recent years. I am (as someone recently mentioned...) more in my comfort zone in the later Victorian era, and one reason for that is the extended palette the writers use. After wandering through the vast Dickensian and Trollopian expanses of London, being stuck sewing in a cramped cottage seems a little tame by comparison...

The economically advantaged do not seem to believe that avoiding poverty is the main issue. If they did, they would not be seeking to rise so far above it. Poverty, for them, is often a shorthand term, used to refer to those who don’t share their values (not to mention their advantages), and whom society has thus rightly consigned to the scrap heap, rarely salvageable to the point of really becoming like themselves. For the wealthy, the poor tend to be a sort of group, like public school teachers or Mexicans, who are out there somewhere, not doing things very well, but in any case not personally relevant.

The idea is really simple. There are emotions that, at your early stages, plague your trading and cause erroneous entries and exits. Those are the same emotions that cause the crowd’s mistakes. As you learn to deal with your emotions, as you take control over them and diminish, then eliminate, their impact on your trading decisions, you don’t completely eliminate emotions themselves. You just learn to dull them and separate your trading actions from their influence. However, you still should be able to observe them as detached cold-blooded observer, This is a stage where you gain an ability to actually utilize them instead of being their slave. If you can feel how huge selloff creates this feeling of panic somewhere deep in you, this is what crowd feels. Feel the temptation to buy this parabolic upward spike, seemingly unstoppable? Chances are, at the moment when you feel the strongest urge to give up and just buy, that’s when the last buyers, desperate not to miss the train, hit their Buy at Market buttons.

A lot has been written about clutter and "getting organized." There are professional organizers who assist people in clearing and organizing their "stuff." There are shows on television that help people "get organized." (The hoarder shows are dealing with deep, psychological issues, so I'm not including them in this list.) If you look around, you will find many articles and magazines usually giving space to "getting organized" or "decluttering." So it's clearly a topic that most can relate to.

At 33 weeks, things are just starting to get serious around here… seriously exciting. We’ve even started child birth classes which have made this whole thing feel very real. While there hasn’t been much progress on the nursery since I posted this picture…
I am in no way racist, but point C really has been getting to me lately. And you know why? Because I HAVE been called a White Bitch, by people who have had far more opportunities than me but who are just holding on to some cultural ideal that allows them a sense of security and purpose! I’ve been called a White Bitch for not giving to beggars, for answering too many questions in highschool, for not wanting to buy crap that is being sold on the side of the road, for complaining about bad service…. the list goes on.

Matt Cutts: Google Video on Good Quality Content vs SEO
As we were having this conversation, I was reminded of the phrase "there's no use crying over spilled milk." As parents, we always have choices. When a child spills milk, we can choose a lot of different reactions. We may get angry and decide to yell and scream, frightening and intimidating the child for their careless, wasteful behavior. We may also choose to stand over them and make them clean it up. I have to think that the only thing this leaves the child with is a sense of fear and hurt - nothing is gained, and nothing is learned except "I think I need to avoid making any more mistakes or Daddy will yell." Of course, we could also try to guilt route, and choose to moan about the inconvenience they have caused us, how now there is no milk for US, and how OUR money was just wasted all over the floor. Our kids are likely to feel shamed, saddened, and disrespected. After all, there's no milk left for them, either.

I never had or heard of a WIP in my life until I met my Scrap BFF in real life. After we'd crop I discovered sometimes that she just sat on layouts that I thought looked perfectly fine and ready to post. Then it got me in this stage where I never thought anything was good enough or that I shouldn't be rushing through layouts without a lot of thought to whether it was GOOD to GO!
Last Tuesday, the LCGOP unanimously adopted a resolution that would ask all candidates who want to get on the primary ballot to sign a pledge with 28 principles, because the party “does not want to associate with candidates who do not act and speak in a manner that is consistent with the SC Republican Party Platform.”

My professor then told me a story, and it went like this: Once you get a certain number of successful movies made in Hollywood as a writer, your name goes in a rolodex (or now, I suppose, smartphone) on a producer’s desk. When they want a movie made based off their marketing data, they call somebody in that rolodex. So, when the news that a giant snake picture was due came to a certain producer’s desk, they called the professor’s friend (call him ‘Bob’) on a Friday afternoon.

Tomorrow's forecast is snow, after two gloriously warm days. Knowing this, I got out for a walk early. Not much color here in our neck of the world, but I did notice my crocuses were struggling to bloom this morning.

Don’t get me wrong; flash is a great arena for trying out big ideas, out-there concepts that would be hard to sustain in a longer piece. But all too often the initial concept seems to take up all the writer’s energy. Characters are wooden stereotypes. The story doesn’t go anywhere. The internal logic breaks down. The story fizzles out at the end or the author panics and wraps it up without taking it to any kind of logical conclusion. Ultimately, this kind of story can be hugely frustrating. If the idea appeals to a reader, they’re going to be annoyed when the writer gets all ham-fisted and messes it up or realises they’ve taken on more than they can handle and just chickens out.

Of course, it’s never easy to tell what would look flattering without actually trying it on your lips, but I really didn’t want to put any of the drugstore aisle lip products anywhere near my face. I figured I probably shouldn’t buy that many though, seeing as how I’d never tried them before and didn’t know how they would perform. I decided to go with 412 Charismatic Coral and 112 Unending Kiss. 814 and 227 seemed similar to Clinique’s Creamy Nude and Smashbox’s Primrose, respectively – at least from what I could recall. And I didn’t think I was quite so brave as to sport such a bold red, so I skipped out on 312 as well.

It is agreed upon and it will be announced upfront that if there according to the jury is no candidate in the finale who has the quality of a world class conductor of tomorrow, there will be no winner. It is, however, also agreed that having no winner would not be a desirable situation since this would seriously jeopardize the credibility and importance of the competition. The jury will therefore do its utmost to find a winner. Should the competition nevertheless end without a winner, the orchestras mentioned below will be able to choose one of the three finalists as conductor of the respective concerts.

When we lived in North Cyprus, my husband and I decided one day to walk to the flags. These were huge flags, one Turkish, one North Cypriot (a flag recognized in precisely one country -- Turkey) and I was sure we could reach them if we just kept walking. My husband, a pessimist, didn't think it was possible, and as we labored up the hill, I began to think he might be right. The road curved and twisted and spiraled, and it went up and down. Sometimes the flags looked like they were right around the corner; sometimes it looked as though the road we were on was taking us in the opposite direction. Then, almost an hour after we set out, we turned a corner and saw that we had reached the flags--we were there. And yet there was another road that zig-zagged away, up through the mountains, and I knew that the flags were just the first point of a much longer destination, and that one day we would have to come back and see where that road led.
On the plus side, shortstop Carlos Triunfel drove the ball with authority on Tuesday. He launched a two-run homer over the bullpens in left field, and he smashed a triple to the gap in right-center.

I tell myself every day I’m intelligent and have much to offer the world. I eat fried chicken in public and watermelon too. If someone’s watching me eat watermelon and thinking about some wide watermelon grin, or find me beneath them because I’m eating fried chicken and they right over there eating it too, that’s their problem.

Courtney again fuels my belief she is the most skilled competitor in history when Ben offered her the fantasy suite card and instead, she asked him how he felt about it. This girl shouldn’t be a model. She should go around to high schools and teach girls to compliment fish. You don’t even know you are doing it until it is too late. Jedi Mind Trick, shit.

I did this absolute zero carb thing for about a week, but at the end of it I started getting really tired, really early and wondered if the complete lack of carbs was the culprit. Sure enough, I made myself some spaghetti with whole wheat noodles that night and the next day I was fine. So, I’ve started incorporating a very small amount of carbs in my last meal of the day and it seems to have worked itself out. The cravings are still minimal, and I have tons of energy now.

I look up across the room at the harsh flashing lights of the 'Lucky Coin' concession, where an array of slot machines and computer games shout silently across the space. I'm always surprised to see these machines, I can't quite fathom the mindset that makes people simply give away their money to a shiny metal monster; even now there's a navy-sweat-shirted man there, pressing the buttons, in desperation or unbridled optimism; either strikes me as sad.

I really can’t pick between which of these films should be higher than the other. I love the original Batman because it helped to move the superhero genre forward. It was dark, gritty, and the first real Batman film. Not only that but it is a pretty good film too with its beautiful art direction and excellent casting. But with that you also have Batman Returns, which went into a totally different direction. If Batman was Burton containing himself then Returns is Burton full blown. Returns is Burton’s Batman and a really cool reimaging of Gotham and some of its famous rogue villains. I think that when you look at both movies you see that each served a purpose. Batman was the first real case for a serious and dark superhero film. It was a movie that proved that the “real” cape crusader could exist on screen. And then you have Returns, which was the Batman film that Burton probably always intended to make. Returns may not be very faithful to its source material but I sort of forgive it for that and accept it as Burton’s own attempt to make “his” Batman story. I guess the reason why I couldn’t decide between the two is because one is a better Batman film and the other is just a better movie. I guess in the end I’m just glad that Burton left his fingerprint on the Batman series before Hollywood finally got a hold of it.

With both clerics and wizards all having detect magic at will, there was a lot of detecting going on. Like search beams throughout the entire dungeon and like tri-corders inspecting every find, these detectors could find and strip any magical object down to its bare bones in seconds. I tried to dampen the rampant magic and described many things like the potions for example, by their knowledge, rather than glowing, like by its pink bubbly fizz the wizard knew the levitation, and by its rich orange flavor, the cure light wounds. I like the division of arcane and divine powers that is so drastic in fourth edition, and it seemed like clerics and wizards should not overlap in thei detection. When, for example, a cleric cast detect magic on a looted wand, I described it as having s slippery feeling, and that she needed to hand it to a wizard for proper detection. Other than that, I really didn’t mind the ease with which magic items were detected, and the fact that wands had charges, and would run out eventually, added some coolness to it.

Tensions are likely to be pretty high, especially in New York City, were some leading organizers were reportedly visited at home by New York police and FBI agents yesterday who interviewed them about their plans. (The high temperatures and 80% chance of rain won’t help either.) It remains to be seen if other May Day events will encounter problems like we saw in San Francisco last night, but the NYPD is obviously expecting some trouble and will likely be better prepared for it than most police forces.

The key to getting a great deal on a Jermyn Street shirt is knowing which shirtmaker to buy from and buying several shirts at a time. Some shirtmakers, like Turnbull & Asser and Thomas Pink, are quite expensive and outside of this Gentleman’s budget. However, there are three classic Jermyn Street shirtmakers that provide shirts at excellent prices: Charles Tyrwhitt, T.M. Lewin and Harvie and Hudson. Of those three, Harvie and Hudson is a bit more pricey but has the best reputation. The way to go for each of these stores is to buy their bulk deals. Both Charles Tyrwhitt and T.M. Lewin offer any four shirts for 100 £. I sprang for two shirts from Harvie and Hudson and my roommate picked up a third to round out the deal. After shipping and currency conversion, each shirt came out to $55, lower than the price of dress shirts at mall retailers like Banana Republic and J. Crew.

When I finally stepped out into the street, I was a bit confused and worried. Just a moment before I had glanced into the loathsome bundle and there had not quite been what I had expected. It was true, I had seen worse, like blood-talismans and once even a hand. This could even be easy. However, this town was small, known as Renaissance. It might be difficult to find the Chosen One this time - and perhaps even more difficult to deliver my message.
The traffic light and the traffic policeman is a common sight on every crossing. Oprah Winfrey, when she visited India recently and travelled across Mumbai, and later between Delhi and Agra, wondered what they were for. The mystery is yet to be solved. It is somewhat like figuring out why there is a Queen in England. I believe they are there because it is a tradition to have traffic lights (four) and traffic policeman (one) – a convention, without which the city roads would look less like roads, and more like lanes or highways. In some parts of India the traffic cop cuts a sorry figure, being abused and ignored; at others he is an evil character, stopping vehicles randomly, for his ‘cut’. (A ‘cut’ is a type of a tax imposed in India; the concept of this tax cannot be explained in this article.)
Venus in Capricorn is seeking partners with strong shoulders who bear their burdens well, partners who act their age (even older than their chronological age).

If a game asks nothing of its players, what’s left of it as a game? It’s a harsh question, but it’s also the most informative lens through which to examine WoW’s current problem.

So here’s the skinny on this meal’s budget. As you can imagine, pasta is one of the cheapest ways to go for dinner. Since we already had most of the general food items, like flour, dry mustard, and butter, our entire purchase totaled about $5.00! Seriously, guys if you are feeling completely poor like me, this meal is the way to go; it’s delicious, mostly nutritious, inexpensive, and is guaranteed to bring you back to the good ‘ol days.

And thus I sailed through the second trimester, feeling like a million wizard bucks until around the 7th month of pregnancy when I began to feel severe pelvic pain if I moved. As in, moved at ALL. My midwife and the sonogram confirmed that my baby was, in fact, a rather LARGE one and was currently in a posterior position (head down but turned around the wrong way) and therefore pressing on my pelvis. Whatever, I thought. I'm American with German and Dutch roots and I have size 11 feet and I am POWERFUL. None of the men in my family dip below the 6 foot tall mark and besides, I am NINJA. And a WIZARD. I am a NINJA WIZARD. And if anyone could turn this baby around, I COULD. Duh. Talk began of "he might be a 10 pounder" and even though I began to have serious issues making it up and down the 104 steps to our apartment nor could I walk more than a block without searing pain in my groin, or even turn over in bed without crying out....undeterred I marched on, knowing in my heart that I could, in fact, get this big baby out naturally.

I’ve had quite a busy weekend in the garden doing a couple of hours of weeding at the shared plot which had got a bit overgrown. There’s still carrots and beetroot going strong up there with cabbages, parnsips and brussels coming on nicely. And I finally got round to planting my onion sets today, a bit later than usual, but it’s been such a mild Autumn I’m sure they’ll be fine. This year I’m growing two varieties Troy F1 and Electric, a red onion that I’ve never grown before. There’s 50 of each and they fit in a space roughly 6 foot square planting 5″ apart in rows spaced at 10″ so I can get the hoe around them in the spring.

On each the smiley face on a luminous sticker grins out. Already I have difficulty remembering where they came from. I think they were given out each time we went to a little toddlers' art group. Placed there perfunctorily by the kind lady who ran it, but well-loved by my daughter. Now I remember. A different time. A different place. I suddenly feel a keen sense of change; of loss. But of course we haven’t lost anything. Just time. I want to wrap my daughter up in her little coat and transport us back to those days, simply because we can never return.

“The nook was, however, the best investment I ever made. It was either that or more bookshelves and then having to move bookshelves and boxes of books any time we relocate. The downside is that its like giving an addict an unlimited supply. Before she had to at least drive to the bookstore for her fix, now its just a click of a button!”

With Jolly temporarily blinded by his love-goggles, Grits wanted to hone in particularly on the utterly unrealistic discussion of the budget from the challenger. Ironically, his stances mirror positions taken and promises made by Garcia when he first ran for Sheriff, most of which crashed upon the rocky shores of economic reality almost immediately after he took office. Here's the segment (in full) of BJ's post on the budget:

Other methods distract us and get us off track to our real purpose. Is it any wonder we’re prone to lose what we construct on our own? When we let God construct our depth, our strength, our wealth, our relationships, and our ministry to others, it will endure for all time. No one can take from us what the Father gives. When we learn to spurn the world in which we’ve been placed temporarily, we stay focused on our reason for being—for we are not of this world, it is not our eternal destination.

Use positive words in making your request. There is naught but the perfect condition desired. Then plant in your soul the perfect seed idea and that alone. Now ask to manifest health and not to be healed of disease, to express harmony and realize abundance – not to be delivered from inharmony, misery and limitations. Throw these off as you would discard an old garment. They are old and only outgrown things, you can afford to discard them joyfully. Do not even turn to gaze upon them. They are no-thing – nothing.

As a rule, the street brawls between radical right-wing groups and members of an anti-fascism movement known under the umbrella term “Antifa” rarely show up on police blotters, though both sides post videos of the melees on the internet, depending, of course, on who prevailed. Whereas Antifa activists largely stick to fists and boots, several of their cohorts in recent years have been killed in knife attacks.

The plot, well, you know, this is Resident Evil: what do we need a story for? but since we have the makers from the first movie back it has a little more substance than the 2nd and 3rd movie of the series: Alice is back and she is lonely after having send her clones into Umbrella HQ in Hong Kong where they all died – some of them killed by the guy who is supposed to be the new T-virus supervillain (figures that they take a male to replace Alice). He is also the one that changes Alice back into a mere human – and she thanks him for it before they crash land with their superheli.

“A representative for Coca-Cola, Diana Garza Ciarlante, said the company directed its caramel suppliers to modify their manufacturing processes to reduce the levels of the chemical 4-methylimidazole, which can be formed during the cooking process and as a result may be found in trace amounts in many foods. “While we believe that there is no public health risk that justifies any such change, we did ask our caramel suppliers to take this step so that our products would not be subject to the requirement of a scientifically unfounded warning,” Garza-Giarlante said in an email.”
It is very difficult to imagine that in a group of pupils sitting for grade 7 Zimsec exams, the outcome produces a 100% failure or perhaps you would rather have me say a 0% pass rate? This is serious in the sense that it is unbelievable to imagine that a whole community has failures at grade 7 continuously for years. What it means is that a whole generation has been condemned to failure and this has repercussions for the community.

The other thing is that in both cases, if I catch myself smiling while I’m typing it means the story is going in the right direction. I used to feel joyous when this occurred. However, recent incidents have taught me to be careful. The smiling makes me sloppy, so the more smiling I go, the worst my grammar/sentencing gets! Thus, I have to be careful when I smile because it means I’d need to be a whole lot more of revising afterwards.
He didn't see the need to talk at me. I saw his anger leave his body replaced by a defeated slump in his shoulders. He left me standing there and went to get a drink of water. When he came back the defeat had vanished I saw sadness and somethings else...concern? And then he offered me a drink. That broke me. I was all tears. He should be furious. I pulled the ultimate leaving stunt I acted as if he were the bad guy when he came to save me. I was staying over a another man's house (although things remained completely innocent) and I had refused the very thing I had freely offered to him. My submission.

Most people are disenchanted with the main parties and see no point in voting for a sham local government. However, that disenchantment, for the most part is not turning to votes for smaller parties or independents, which is a pity.

Have you ever wondered why we have all lived through two decades of talk about global warming only to learn that it was a complete fiction? That the science behind it was bogus? And then wondered why the federal government became so involved in this hoax that it wasted $50 billion on “research” to support it and is presently engaged in schemes involving millions more for “alternative” energy such as wind and solar power? Or electric cars? The answers can be found in Climate Coup: Global Warming’s Invasion of Our Government and Our lives ($24.95, Cato Institute) will come off the presses official in April, but I suggest that you put in your order now if you want to learn the extraordinary role the federal government has played in misleading Americans to believe a hoax discredited in 2009 by the release of thousands of emails between the handful of its perpetrators on behalf of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Edited by Patrick J. Michaels, it reveals how corrosive this massive hoax, international in scope, corrupted the U.S. government and endangered our lives. It continues to do so to this day.

"It is curious how often famous rivers fail to live up to their associations: the Tiber is not much to look at, and the Jordan is hardly wider than the Rubicon. In winter, of course, the Rubicon, like all torrents, would be formidable, and Caesar forded it on January 10, in the year 48 B.C., which, as the unreformed calendar was about seven weeks ahead of the sun, would really have been during the November floods. As I stood looking at this stream, to me one of the most thought-provoking sights in Italy, cars, motor-cycles, scooters, coaches, and caravans continued to rush past; and during the few moments I was there several hundred people must have crossed the Rubicon without being aware of it."

I’m back to rocking braid outs and twist outs for a few weeks. I find that braid outs give me a lot more length, but I prefer the definition and the way the curls sit when I do twist outs.

No complaints yet. It works for me, so I’m sticking with it. I’ve found that it helps to reduce some of the frizz.

In reading Preston Spence’s recent Herald letter, in which he re-named the LEED-IE PAC as the ‘PIG PAC’ (people-in-gangs political action committee), I recalled an old song song my mother sang to me, “Knick knack, paddy whack, give the dog a bone….” It seemed apropos to me that Lee County conservatives might re-lyric the refrain of this popular children’s song as follows:
Louie was about fifty years old, stood no taller than five foot one, and combed his thinning black hair straight backwards. He also used some type of grease to slick his hair back, because it always looked shiny and never seemed to move. Louie always had a cigar sticking out of his mouth sideways too, sometimes the tip would be a glowing orange while at other times it was black and un-lit.

This might be ok if TV were a reliable source for accuracy in a “headline news” sort of mode, or if the 24/7 news channels were to take the major stories of the day and give them a journalistic analysis. But that’s not the reality of what national news coverage has become; certainly not with the cable news stations, which have become more and more politicized over time. CNN, which was once thought of as both the bastion of TV journalism and ironically as the mouthpiece of the left is now foundering as not being politicized enough, and therefore 3rd in the cable news ratings.
Communication can be complex. Consider how a message can be presented in what seems like a clear, well-stated way, yet it can be heard and interpreted much differently than intended.

Councilmember Elrich provided the most complete discussion of the curfew proposal on its public safety policy merits as he saw them, as opposed to those of “sending a message” or expressing a standard. Elrich staked out ground rather close to that of the County Executive (who all but said ‘statistics, shmatistics‘ in his FAQ document) in asserting that the debate was not “well served by a discussion of data,” but instead turned on an evaluation of the most notorious incident precipitating the proposal – the July gang fight in Downtown Silver Spring.

You are morally and geographically obligated to root for both teams. It's a fact. After seven years, you are given the option to no longer root for the team where you used to live. But until that time, you must. Fortunately for you, you have one team in the AFC and one in the NFC, so you only have to worry about them playing each other once every four years. So that is really easy for you. You root for both to do well, then on the rare occasions they play each other, you follow your heart, but have respect for the other team. But you're obligated to stab your significant other if he roots for the other team.
In The Blue Light Project, Taylor has once again put his literary finger on cultural currents just at the moment of their emergence from our collective subconscious — big ideas like the dynamics and ritual nature of celebrity culture, the need to find (like the freesteal artists) a way of moving freely and creatively through our world, and our ability, through the power of individual choice, to continue to tell our own stories, in the face of unprecedented external scrutiny and manipulation. It is this ability, I think, that imbues his writing with its sense of uncanny fascination, and keeps one returning to the ideas long after the book is finished.

Keep Your Mate in the Loop: For those of you who are married or in long-term relationships, make certain you let your girlfriend/boyfriend or whatever know when you are gaming and where and so on. Let them know that this is important to you and your friends (even if they think it’s stupid themselves), and you’d really like to make it. Provided your spouse is a decent person who values your wishes, doing this kind of thing will prevent unfortunate double-bookings that prevent you from Being There. Also make clear that he/she has the ability to override gaming time if something obviously more important comes up (this includes things like illness, sudden familial obligations, etc., etc.). I could go on, but I’ll stop here, as we are starting to delve into me giving people relationship advice, and this blog is not the place.

So tests done, time to see the doctor. Admittedly I am jaded walking in but that is more about the whole process that has unfolded. First thing I was asked about was the methotrexate. I told the doctor that I really didn’t experience any changes in the few weeks that I took it. I was quickly corrected, rightfully so, that I was supposed to continue taking it. Hey the pills ran out at the same time as the folic acid I was prescribed (to counteract the effects the medication would have on my already suspect blood chemistry) and I thought doc said it would take a few weeks for it to start showing results… Okay so I received a new prescription of methotrexate and the “refills” part was emphasized and I am back on that.

Worlds away from the shark attack these cutting remarks were attacks of a different kind, designed to thwart Watson’s political ambitions. What it demonstrates, however, is how Watson’s public persona became synonymous with the terrifying tale of his struggle against the shark.

Below the engraving is a small blurb in English and French detailing the ‘Loss of the Flesh & Foot, torn from the Right Leg’ and Watson being ‘sav’d from the Jaws of the voracious Animal’.

Indeed, the contagion most feared by Rebekah Brooks and James Murdoch is that involving allegations of hacking after the 2005-6 Inclusion Zone – ie, that zone within which Newscorp admits unequivocal guilt for hacking people illegally. Adverse revelations inside the period would be devastating (especially if they had any bearing upon the Brown/Blair plot story); but much more danger, yet again, lies in the upcoming civil cases pertaining to the period 2007-10, to which (I’m led to understand) a substantial number of allegations pertain.

And what of the Apostle Paul? One book, The Mystery of Jesus, concluded that Jesus and Paul were one in the same. It hinges on the idea that Jesus took an assumed identity after his so-called death. Of course it could be true, but I do not personally believe it. The Apostle Paul has a similar past to Jesus, yet his tone and message are different. He was a friend of the Apostle Luke apparently, but never personally met Jesus himself. Again, I think Paul perhaps shared a connection to Jesus in some way. Maybe they did meet after Jesus’ resurrection or maybe they simply shared relatives. In any case, I get the feeling that Paul was out to make amends. He wanted to clear Jesus’ name, creating meaning out of his surprising death. It was if he had some personal stake in convincing everyone of Jesus’ divinity.
The one thing I am fussy about is the sauce. It needs to be thick as the water from the pasta can dilute it and make the sauce very runny. I want something that sticks to my ribs. If you can be organised enough (I am not but try to make the effort for this.) add a peeled onion chopped in half, a handful of black peppercorns and a couple of torn bay leaves to the milk the night before you make it. Not hugely important but if you try it you will be glad you did. Don't throw the onion away as it can be cooked to go into the dish. We don't want to waste anything now do we?

With a third of my time at school here over, I’ve had ups and downs just like I would at home. As a study abroad student, orientations drill into your head the curve of emotions you will experience. Immediate elation upon arriving into the new environment; coming down off of that high and feeling homesick or out of place; acclimation to the local culture. I can say that I was skeptical at first, but I know that I in fact experienced all stages of this already. Almost a month into being in Morocco, I was struck with a general malaise which was accentuated whenever I saw emails from home or went on Facebook. I came to realize this was me, feeling homesick and having some issues with separation with the only home I’d known for 21 years. The slump lasted about two weeks, and traveling on the weekends during that time definitely helped. Now I feel much better and I am used to the day-to-day like it’s always been this way. The final stage of the emotional roller coaster is said to be reverse culture shock upon returning to one’s home country; luckily, I have quite a while until I experience that!

John Carter is about a reluctant warrior who gets roped into other people’s wars. First this army officer tries to bully him into fighting Apaches, but Carter refuses, saying he didn’t start it. So he ends up having to finish a 1,000 year-old war on Mars instead. But the real enemies are these godlike beings who pull the strings from the shadows and feed off the destruction. The environment of every planet they visits ends up dying while its inhabitants are busy battling each other. How’s Carter supposed to win that fight?

One guilty pleasure I'll admit to is Sleeper, a musically and conceptually lazy (their lyrics were okay, though) U.K. rock group from the 1990s, one of many also-rans of the Britpop era. There's absolutely no reason I should REALLY like them any more than, say, Pulp or Elastica or The Boo Radleys or (even) Blur (whom I don't like much at all), or any of the dozens of others who waved the banner of 'Cool Britannia'. My guilt here derives not from any sense of embarrassment for admiring music such as this, but only because I can't figure out why I do. Maybe it's something about needing to have favorites in every conceivable category, like why are The Misunderstood my favorite 60s California Psychedelic band who didn't hail from L.A. or the Bay Area? Or why is Brigitte Bardot my favorite Ye-Ye girl, when she isn't a Ye-Ye girl at all? Or why The Big Boys but not The Dicks? Or Steve & Eydie but not Nino & April? The Vogues but not The Lettermen? Why is Turn Down Day my favorite summer song of 1966, and not Summer In The City? Or Summer Wind? Or Sunny Afternoon? Or Sunny? See You In September? You've got to pick something, and so, for 60s/New Wave-inspired, guitar-based, tuneful English Rock created between 1994 and 1997, I choose Sleeper.

Then came the highlight – a wonderfully cooked piece of grilled saba (mackarel). The fish’s skin was beautifully charred and blistered by the grill, leaving it tasting really moreishly salty and smoky. Its crispness contrasted perfectly with the soft white fish flesh inside, the flakes of which were all infused with a subtle smoky flavour. I felt like I could easitilyorgo the rest and come here just to eat this dish.
Cliff started recording as a child in the early 1960s with producer Leslie Kong. In the late 1960s, he moved to Britain where he enjoyed considerable success with the song 'Wonderful World, Beautiful People'. He became a massive star after starring in 'The Harder They Come', the 1972 low-budget movie based on the exploits of Ivanhoe 'Ryghin' Martin, a gunman who terrorized sections of west Kingston in 1948. The film's soundtrack contains songs that are Cliff standards, including the title track, 'Sitting In Limbo' and 'You Can Get It If You Really Want'.

“I came to Living Waters feeling quite stuck, hopeless, and finding it hard to feel accepted in some relationships. Abuse was part of my past. In the talks, I saw that some of the events of my life were truly damaging. I learned the importance of things like boundaries and understood that my boundaries had been broken (more than I had supposed). When I went to my small group, I could talk about the things I learned and pray about them. God was there with me in my abuse. I was able to bring my hurt and worries to the cross, and experience how compassionate Christ is. Now when things are hard I am much more likely to go to God instead of either compartmentalizing my pain or spiraling down into negative thought patterns. I know I have a choice.”
Found in a record shop in Chester today in the 50p box. I was drawn to the sleeve art I suppose rather than the music which is pretty much as you would expect from an 80's TV show - lots of popular classics, Vangelis and few atmospheric oddities like the Bulgarian chanting thrown in for good measure.

To accomplish this growth, the hero must be imperfect. He needs something to overcome. It needn’t be gigantic like changing his entire personality and going from an evil-doer to the best neighbour you’ll ever have. It can be as little as opening his eyes to the fact he’s neglected his family and spends too much time at work.
Big brother Dalu looks at her as if he is thinking, "What is this- some new kind of chihuahua?". He gave her a good sniff and then more or less proceeded to ignore her. He does look very concerned when she starts bawling in the middle of the night.

So I am really controlling about making sure Ryan loves everything as well. There are a few things that have gone into his closet and his room that I don't LOVE. shocking! but Ryan loves them so I am fine with it. Our styles are so different and what we love is so different. If Ryan was able to have totally control over T's room it would be painted camo, with camo bedding, with deer antlers hanging in every inch of the wall, with some dead animal on the floor and a closet of only camo and cowboy boots.
Food cravings: None really, but I love coke slushies from Speedway. It is like this, “I have to have you right now” type of craving. Although I have wanted foods that I don’t really eat such as sugary cereal. I am convinced you are a boy because your dad and Uncle loves their cereal too.
Along with a good rest, nutrition plays a very important role in bringing back the mother to the regular lifestyle.A good diet will ensure that the mother recovers from the stress of delivery and also has reserves to feed the baby and to save energy for the future.Exhaustion is a main complaint in the new mothers. A good diet will boost the energy levels of the mothers.Another common complaint is postpartum depression. This too can be fought with some super effective foods.

The inspiration around the house for the Get Sketchy challenge was our place settings, which are a red gingham placemat with a white dinner plate on it. The patterned paper is from the new Modern Homemaker paper pad from October Afternoon. The notecard and shimmer couture paper are from A Muse. I used the Nestablities circle dies to make the plate and charger. The silverware stamp is from A Muse and I embossed it with gold glitter embossing powder from American Crafts to resemble the "good silverware". The sentiment stamp is my new What's Cooking cling set from Taylored Expressions. This set is so adorable and I'm so excited to use the rest of it to make many more cards! I thought it needed just a little something else so I added the pearls above the sentiment, which are from A Muse. I hope my MIL likes it and so do you! I hope all of you get to enjoy some time with your families tomorrow and this weekend. I also hope you get to steal some time for yourself to create. Happy Crafting!

I will also never forget the enormous pain and emptiness that I felt when I had to leave her there and come back home, not knowing when I would be seeing her again. Everytime I thought of her (which was at least 500 times a day), I felt like I'd been punched in the gut and hit in the heart. It physically hurt to think about her there in that godawful place, wondering if anyone had picked her up that day, if anyone had held her, if she'd had enough to eat, if she was sick, etc. It was mental torture. And as the weeks turned into months, the helplessness and deep ache just became more profound. All the while, I was physically ill, dealing with the intense cramping and bleeding that preceded (and necessitated) my hysterectomy. It was fucking awful.

The content analysis I have proposed takes Mohamed’s existing research design and updates it using current stories from a sample of major media outlets in the United States. He found network news portrayal of Arab men to fit into five main categories: involvement in terrorism, reference to Islam and Jihad, involvement in physical violence (bombing in particular), possession of weapons, and as victims or targets of physical violence committed by other Arabs and Muslims. His research supported past findings that categorize Arabs as “brutal, heartless, uncivilized, religious fanatics.”
If you leave out Rahane and look at the batting you wonder where is the brightness coming from ? Kohli’s performances this IPL have almost made us forget his heroics just a month back. Raina has been patchy. Cheteshwar Pujara warms the bench for the entire IPL. Rohit Sharma is fast becoming the biggest joke in Indian Cricket the talented player who can only seem so but do nothing. Sachin’s prowess is waning and is visible. The biggest worry is the Indian captain who seems to have lost zest out of cricket, maybe the 2 month break after the IPL changes his demeanour. Don’t talk about how Gauti and Veeru are in form, they underachieved on two foreign tours and we all are aware of their capabilities of smashing on Indian tracks and I refuse to be flattered by Sehwag’s run of form. I am his biggest fan if there ever was one but this is not where Sehwag has to prove he is still good. The other youngsters, Utthappa failed to get our attention, neither did Manish Pandey, Badrinath too seems to be waning.

Call of Duty: Black Ops
Tolkien's celebrated affinity for worldbuilding means that The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings clearly take place in the same invented world, but it's precisely at those points that the two works overlap that the differences between their Middle Earths are most apparent. There is danger in The Hobbit, and the characters face many merciless, amoral foes. But evil, which drives the antagonists in The Lord of the Rings, is absent from the book--its villains are merely bad. There is, as well, no sense of grandeur in The Hobbit, nor of the high stakes that are perpetually in the background, and finally the foreground, in The Lord of the Rings. Nowhere is the gulf between the two books' tones more apparent than in the chapter "Riddles in the Dark," which Tolkien rewrote when the idea for The Lord of the Rings began germinating in him. In the chapter's original version, Gollum bets the ring willingly and accepts its loss with good grace. The new version feels very much as if Bilbo has temporarily stepped into another novel--a grimmer, darker one--which is exactly what he has done, but which leaves The Hobbit, and particularly those later chapters in which Bilbo cavalierly uses the ring (which in the new "Riddles in the Dark" is treated as a character with its own desires, as it is for the whole of The Lord of the Rings), feeling rather wobbly (a similar wobbliness afflicts Gandalf's attempts to explain, at the council of Elrond, why he spent so much time and energy assisting Thorin in his quest to regain his grandfather's treasure, and why this victory was significant in the war against Sauron).

Hopefully with a more solid expansive foundation. It's why guys like Gladwell and Klosterman are celebrated as geniuses and then get backlash when everyone is on the island looking for somewhere new to go.

How do we show love? Many of you probably have a boyfriend of girlfriend (depending on your gender), and even if you don’t, you probably have someone to whom you are very close, whether it be a friend, relative, colleague, peer, or parent. (No man is an island, you know.) How do we communicate our love to them? There are a variety of ways. One would be to talk with that person. And not necessarily about anything monumental, either. Just to open up and speak freely about anything and everything. This demonstrates a level of trust between the participants. Another is acts of service. To give of your time and energy to perform a task for their benefit, not for praise or to be patted on the back, but just to let them know that you are thinking them, and care for their wants and needs. Both of these require that we give the one thing that we have which can never be replaced: our time. In a very real way, your life is nothing but time. Breath is just a clock. You have so much allotted to you, and once it’s gone, it cannot be regained. So to give of your time is truly the greatest act of love that you can perform. If you are in a relationship (the romantic variety), you know that all you want to do is to be with that person – to do things for them, talk to them, or just be there, even if you’re doing nothing more than watching the clouds. Everything is more beautiful when you’re together.

Over-all our family has had a very busy year. We vacationed in California with all of Rachel's family and spent the week at the River House playing with cousins and water-skiing. We have been actively trying to find a baby to adopt and have had lots of ups and downs with that. Currently our home is for sale and we have an offer on a beautiful, brand new home near by. So we are waiting patiently for the right buyer to come along.

The movie A Prairie Home Companion (with Kevin Klein, Linsday Lohan, and Meryl Streep!) is funny, whimsical, and a bit odd. The movie (surprise surprise) is about a live radio variety show (of the same name) that is about to close and the characters that Keillor uses in the real-life show are real people in the film’s radio show (if that makes sense).

She asked Adi to bring her magic wand so she can take off the tooth with the wand while Adi is asleep. She called Adi as dora. Kids love when someone treats them special ain’t it? After the consultation Adi was excited about the extraction. She told me yesterday “mommy don’t forget tomorrow we have to go to dental office with my wand.. The doctor wanted to see my wand”.

The Army released suicide data today for the month of January. During January, among active-duty soldiers, there were 16 potential suicides: five have been confirmed as suicide and 11 remain under investigation. For December, the Army reported 11 potential suicides among active-duty soldiers. Since the release of that report, eight have been confirmed as a suicide and three remain under investigation.
Recently I purchased an antique photo album from the Victorian period. It is embossed leather (which I cannot resist touching, you know how it is with textures, LOL!) with gilt pages, some with painted scenes and it is filled with old photographs many from the 1800’s. I love it and it has become a valuable resource for portraits for art and also just for the sheer pleasure of it! I love faces!

The launch spec exhaust places the outlet pipe inboard and relatively low. This bows in line with the plane of the rear upper wishbone. The bodywork over the gearbox and rear crash structure is curved and creates a neat channel for the flow to pass through. This then sees the exhaust plume pass under the beam wing. In this position the heat is affecting the upper wishbone, even at its launch, the car sported heat shielding over the wishbones. During testing this protection has grown, albeit with temporary looking solutions, suggesting the new exhaust system will not blow in this area.

In end of the world stories, except for maybe The Stand, people avoid thinking about what New York would be like. I have this idea in my head I would try to stay but I know it’s impossible. It’s even harder to keep food on the table than it would be in the ‘burbs because I never buy more than a day or two’s worth of groceries.

we took apart our large fish pond and made it into a small fish tank instead. The fish pond took up so much room in our screened in patio, and it had been prone to leaking, so we said 'to hell with it' and downsized. We gave some small fish away, as we now had too many with our fish tank, and I set a small alligator figurine my sister bought me long ago in the bottom of the tank. The fish are not afraid.

I don't think this was Stanley's plan with these pieces. That he, and Lebeck, sought for a creative alternative--i.e., to make these Dirys something readers might actually look forward to reading--was impressive enough. That Lulu's personality emerges from this prose is a remarkable perk.

Keeping life in perspective is important. Perspective: meaning to take everything into account, creating a clearer picture of what we are seeing and experiencing. Living a fluid lifeline, I love that, I need that. A view that accounts for what has happened, what is happening now, and what may happen tomorrow. It gives me a steadiness and hope for all times. It’s Life, after all, and I want to live it to the fullest.

As the youngest of ten children, my husband was photographed only infrequently. It was just not high on the priority list, with so many other things to attend to. I've always thought that the earliest picture of him in existence was from when he was nearly a year old, sitting amongst all of his other siblings. Yet, suddenly I found myself looking at a sweet photo of him as an infant, being held by my late mother-in-law. She was over 40 when she had him, and must surely have been exhausted with so many children to care for, but she looks as happy as a young, first time mother. To me, such a picture is priceless.
Since that afternoon, Rylie wishes to fore go any other activity (ie. ice skating, ballet class, her one movie a week, trips to the bookstore, play dates with friends,) to go to the park with the hopes that Jake will be there. Every day when I pick Rylie up from school and we talk about her day, she gives me the rundown of when and where she saw Jake during the day. She tells me what he said to her, what shirt he was wearing, what he did that was "SO silly."

His film career had several phases which came in nice discreet bundles. First he did two silent films in the mid-teens that went nowhere. One of them, Pool Sharks (1915), survives, and Fields acquits himself admirably in it. After an eight year hiatus he returned to do numerous silent features in the years 1924-28. These films did respectably well but were not blockbusters. A notable project during this time was D.W. Griffith’s 1925 adaptation of Fields Broadway hit Poppy, renamed Sally of the Sawdust. It is the archetypical Fields’ yarn: he plays a much-put-upon circus owner, who is the guardian of a young girl. The girl is in love with a rich young man, whose folks think she is not good enough for it by virtue of her being show folk. Underneath his venal exterior, Fields reveals a few sterling qualities at bottom, and so manages to effect a happy ending by the last reel. His first talkies, were the aforementioned adaptations of Ziegfeld sketches which he did for Mack Sennett in the early thirties. There are a half dozen of these exquisite, nearly perfect set pieces – and far too few of them, at that. IT is in the talkies that we truly get the full Fields effect. Not only the shiney red face, steely blue eyes, bulbous nose and crooked little mouth, but the raspy voice, alternately shouting or muttering almost indecipherable asides in his distinctive lingo, “Godfrey Daniels” is the way he said “God damn it” in those censorious day. But Fields could leave no phrase alone. “I hit him on the head”, became “I smote him on the sconce” before Fields was done with it. He populated his scripts (and his film credits) with likewise Dickensian character names: Otis Cribblecobblis, Mahatama Kane Jeeves, and Egbert Souse. In some films, such as You’re Telling Me and It’s a Gift he portrays a much put-upon family man in a recognizable human situation. Others, like International House and Million Dollar Legs give full vent to total surrealism. It is interesting (and tantalizing) to know that Fields was under consideration for the role of the Wizard in MGM’s The Wizard of Oz.

To help my own political recovery, I’ve drafted a post-Obama doctrine of hope. I hope new grassroots organizers adapt King’s strategies to direct 21st century activism. I hope Americans will restore a profound commitment to human rights within U.S. federal policy. I hope my fellow millenials can learn that a campaign does not make a presidency, and a protest does not make a community. I hope the textbooks we write will not remember King and Obama as mere tokens, but will distinguish between them based on the content of their character. I hope Americans who are frustrated, jaded, and skeptical will rediscover their potential to enact social change. At the very least, I hope we can find some better presidential candidates by 2016.
If you haven’t read The Hunger Games yet, let me give you some context. This is a highly political series with strong themes of rebellion and the horrors of war. Katniss is constantly thinking about her strategies and how far she might go to survive, as well as analyzing her current situation. This is all done quite neatly in her head, as talking to herself isn’t the best thing when there are bloodthirsty Careers after you.

Nevertheless, the Enterprise is repaired, and rescues Kirk before Khan can destroy it. They go off in pursuit. It is an exciting, stalking naval battle between two severely damaged ships. Kirk gains the advantage because khan is thinking two dimensionally. It is a problem that occurred quite often a television trek. Ships often met face to face, but they could travel in all dimensions: up, under, etc. The Enterprise sneaks under and then behind the Reliant to score a direct hit, killing everyone but Khan. The Enterprise is crippled in the attack, so Khan decides to blow up Genesis in a suicide move that will take Kirk with him.

Unfortunately, the way our home is laid out, nearly the entire first floor would need to be redone, at a cost of close to $2000. That’s distinctly un-awesome, but I’m going to look at the silver lining and say that what IS awesome is not going into debt over flooring. Also, I think this means I get to go rug shopping.

And I can still see snow in the shade of our neighbors' barn.

When the Celtics lost Game 1, analysts were already taking them for granted and saying “Oh, they can’t win without Rondo in the lineup.” Of course, Rondo was suspended on Monday for Game 2. They said “A team without Rondo and Allen cannot beat the Hawks.” I thought the Hawks would see no Rondo or Allen and go, “We got this.” Of course, Pierce went off for 36 points. They ended up winning the game, evening up the series 1-1.

I like First Blood. Sometimes it borders on becoming exploitation film, but then I compare it to the live action comic books the sequels often are and then it feels like a masterpiece instead.

I just hope they understand that this was out of my control. Because, if we don't close on Friday and close on Monday instead, 1)we lose money on the moving truck, booked for Saturday and 2)I have to pay the entire month of November's interest whereas if I close in October, I don't.

My encouraging word can become the spark that allows empowerment for what looks to someone else an insurmountable task.

After some light breakfast in the hangar we … went back to the ranger station to watch a movie about the park. What else to do? It was still raining so the airplanes didn’t fly. All we could do is wait for the weather to clear. After that movie there was a bit heavy lunch at the Bettles Lodge and then another movie. A movie about an older guy who hiked and the paddled all the way from Canada till the mouth of Yukon river. It took him time and money to organize this sort of trip. He actually went over that pass in Arrigetch peaks that we, at this point,were not going to. Suddenly the weather cleared a bit and we were off to the Circle Lake – our starting point.

I was a bit obessed, but thankfully my kiddos have mellowed me out. Honestly, I haven't hit the gym enough since my second kiddo was born. I do love being an active mom though.

And I'm not a yarn snob. I DO "Love This Cotton" and "Love This Yarn"... but I also loooooove me some Noro now. Made something with it this weekend (pics to come soon) and am addicted to the colors. Here are some lovely creations from others, showcasing what this yarn can do:
But, unabashed, Sport England picked themselves up, dusted themselves off and replaced the scheme with a new target to encourage one million adults to do “three 30 minute sessions of moderate intensity sport a week” by 2013. Thanks, Nanny just what we needed.
Now, there are quarrels about how things were before and after the death of Louis XVI, before and after Henri IV was made king, before and after St Joan of Arc fought for English getting back across the Channel. Some of these things are therefore less knowable or less easy to access the knowable truth than for the succession of rulers through the years. But no one is even pretending St Joan of Arc was not born 600 years earlier than when I write these lines, and I think it is as impossible to doubt that as it is for me to doubt that de Gaulle ruled Gaul when I was born.
On March 16, Sgt. Mark Gottlieb and Inv. Ben Himan conducted a field interview with the accuser. Gottlieb asserted that he took no contemporaneous notes; months later, he produced a “straight-from-memory” typed report. Both Himan and Gottlieb brought from this interview the accuser’s claim that she was attacked by three people. But they recorded radically different descriptions—almost as if they hadn’t attended the same field interview.

Ever ready to cram his mug in front of the local news cameras and shiv the Second Amendment in the liver in return for some free airtime, local gun shop owner Don Davis, owner of Don's Guns, former Hoffa bodyguard, and all-around douchebag and general tool, offered up this gem:

My ninth grade students are reading a book in Humanities 1 and creating a wiki web page/scrapbook on it. All the books on the book list deal with the themes of Revolution or Colonialism. The Kitchen Boy by Robert Alexander is one of the books that was on the list and about 18 students chose to read it. The Kitchen Boy is an excellent story of the Russian Revolution in 1917 where the Tzar and his family are arrested and imprisoned in the House of Special Purpose in Siberia.

Lecture last month points out where the Legislature skewed up while setting up tribunals. Putting the blame squarely on the judiciary for its ‘timorous’ approach in validating tribunals manned by the members of the Executive, she calls this a ‘judicial sell-out to the Executive’. The efforts of the Supreme Court in ensuring ‘independence’ of these bodies, in her opinion are ‘not enough’ and are at best, ‘adjustments in the law which are more in the nature of sops to the concept of judicial independence rather than an assertion of it.’
On this Good Friday, we call this day good because by His death He showed His great love for man and purchased for man every blessing, let us remember and celebrate His love by praying the Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. If you can, try to pray it at 3:00 the hour of Our Lord’s death.
I don’t know about you, but I’m a big fan of TED talks and think it’s a wonderful online resource that makes me hopeful about humanity and mankind. I recently watched a clip that my friend posted up, about how in Jazz there are no mistakes – nothing is ever a mistake, only a failure to respond to the input and failure to accept the gift of that moment.

With her striking looks and charm she probably would have made an excellent actress but, much like me, i guess she was too shy and insecure.
Clarke was a 1930s vamp, a putative film actress, the poor man’s “it” girl. Her most famous role was in “Public Enemy,” when she’s shacked up with Jimmy Cagney and Cagney violently pushes a half-grapefruit in her face. But even in that role, Clarke was uncredited. I guess you could say that even though the grapefruit scene made her somewhat iconic, Clarke never really crashed the big time.
The house is as reverent to the craft of photography as it was when Alice was alive. On the blustery afternoon I spent at the Alice Austen House, the rooms were buzzing with children arriving for a workship on how to make and use pinhole cameras. Replicas of her equipment are featured in exhibits fashioned from Alice's old drawing room.

"Looked at objectively, it is hard to deny that there is less suffering caused by cockfighting than in our apparently insatiable demand for chicken flesh. It is likely that 10,000 or 20,000 chickens have their necks slashed in a mechanized processing plant for each gamecock that dies in a derby. And there is the inconvenient fact that the life of a fighting cock is fifteen times longer and infinitely more pleasurable than the life of a broiler chicken. Why then is it legal for us to kill 9 billion broiler chickens every year, but cockfighting can get you hard time in the federal penitentiary?"
One thing is certain, if and when a sequel of this film is made (sequels are the name of the money making cinematic game), it has a lot to live up to, and sometimes past success is the most difficult marker of critiquing a sequel. I normally expect about one good film a year, but seeing The Hunger Games makes 2012 a year of prospective positive expectations. I’m quite looking forward to the coming Ridley Scott ‘Prometheus’ film, as well as (excuse my primal tendencies) Expendables 2. However having met the quota of good films already I have no expectations.
There are a fair number of hoops to jump through before you can rent a flat in Italy. Strangely enough, these do not seem to include providing references or any sort of proof of employment or that you can actually afford the place you're after. But before you get anywhere near to signing a contract and moving in, you actually have to sign a contract to enter into a formal period of negotiation in which your prospective landlord has a fixed period of time to consider your offer. In other words, it takes a lot longer than it would in the UK.
And something similar happened in the 19th century. England was at that time enormously influential and powerful so whatever was characteristically English came in for great scrutiny, not the least in England itself. What was it that made England great? And as I have set out at great length above, the English themselves had for centuries seen their liberties as a great national treasure. English liberty was a byword and its virtue was unquestionable. So again Leftists did the sort of thing that they always do. They became great champions of liberty. They supported laissez faire in business and writers such as J.S. Mill pushed ideas of liberty to just about their logical extreme. Conservatives, of course stuck with the ideas of extensive but not unlimited liberty that had been normal up until that time. That the "liberals" of that time really were just Leftists can perhaps most clearly be seen in the case of Mill himself. As I have set out briefly here and here the actual policies Mill advocated in parliament were often quite socialist and interventionist. If he could get acclaim for himself by advocating various government interventions in people's lives, all his pro-liberty principles suddenly vanished, just as eugenics suddenly vanished from the Leftist vocabulary after Hitler.
Have you been to a store lately? Apparently the Christmas season is upon us. Tinsel and holly are filling the aisles. . . or rather large blow up santas and light up . . . everything, are filling the aisles. But not at our shop. For now it is still filled with harvest fun. Need a Thanksgiving centerpiece? Some fun fall oak and dot garland? A corn husk wreath or leaf felt place mats? A canvas harvest banner? That's what you'll find if you come shop our booth (along with great furniture and all year round decor, of course). After all, it IS still mid October.

my word for 2011 is life/live. i am committed to living more. not being so much on a one-track journey but really getting out there and living the life i have not lived. sure, maybe a little living la vida loca....but really a more purposeful life. i have started to take some steps towards that recently, and hope to share them here when the time is right and as we go through the year.
The movie revolves around the day of the life of Dante (Brian O’Halloran), a lonely convenience store worker that is trying to get through the day. He is called into work on his day off to open up the store. He doesn’t want to deal with the riffraff that comes into the store everyday.

I won’t go into it much here, you can read all about it here, but let’s just say I wasn’t happy that another celebrity checked out with a chemistry kit in their veins and confused loved ones wondering why.
So say a prayer, whistle a happy tune...whatever it is you do to offer encouragement that life will take us where we're suppose to be. Thanks!
A big part of why I think we are grossly apathetic to the world around us is because of the constant bombardment of self-indulgent distractions. For every incident documenting a violation of our right to assemble comes a slew of celebrity bullshit that dominates the headlines. Just when we have momentum building up from reports of GOP lobbyists plotting to discredit the occupy movement through guerrilla tactics comes another Kardashian wedding. Sadly, it seems we've over-saturated our attention span, making it easy to jump from one newsflash to another, no matter how mundane and trivial one may be. The end result is we see them all the same -- a brief thought shock, received and dismissed as instinctively as when a duck shakes off water.

But, oddly, one thing did not come up in our talk. She never commented on how the game looked or how dated the graphic were. I was, after all, in the Qeynos/Karanas section of the world, which pretty much retains the 1999 look.
There is a specific need of dispensary store of medicine with oral and planned tablets in veterinarian room. Veterinarian offices are just like a hospital with a complete shop of medicine. There should be hand in need time spending rooms with divided places for dogs, cats, and exotics. Veterinarian room should have laboratory to include microscope, parasitology preps, chemistry analyzer, and blood count capability. Veterinarian offices should have a suitable setup for surgery with orthopedic and general surgery packs, general anesthesia instrument, a kennel for hospitalizing ill animals, to quarantine infectious ones. And an X ray machine with a dull room for showing films.
I drew from many of my experiences as a paramedic for Sophie, mixing and matching elements of what I'd been through so her cases are not lifted entirely from real life but do stem from there. I like to use the little things that only a paramedic could know: what it's like to crouch in the backseat of a crashed car, caring for the trapped passenger while the driver sits dead behind the wheel and rain pours down outside, for example, or how blood flows off the stretcher and onto the ambulance floor and out under the back door as you're rushing a dying patient to hospital. How you feel about the ones you can't save.People are fascinated with what goes on behind the ambulance's darkened windows, and the books let me show them.
Counting the cost – Scott discusses the importance of thinking about the “real” cost of self-defense, and the link provided is, in my opinion, essential reading for anyone who thinks they have an opinion on what the media reports on the Martin-Zimmerman case.
When Barbados Free Press published our article Once again Barbados police use race and/or class-based decision making and allow an upper-class elite to escape justice, among the reasoned comments we had the usual crowd of racists spewing their vitriol – but we have standards here at BFP so we canned most of those comments and sent the authors packing.

Stref's slightly stylised art style, and use of flat colour at times, helps blunt the gore to a degree while his deliberate lack of panel borders and toned down colours on the flashback scenes gives those pages a dream-like quality which works well. The book does reveal why X became a killer and, while the plot twist around that revelation could have done with a little more emphasis, it raises the book above the level of the gore and leaves it with a distinctly unsettling conclusion.

Being a musician is not his only talent though. He is a fantastic motivational speaker who has the ability to move the audience to feel his emotion, something he has plenty of given the fact that he was diagnosed with MS at the age of 26 during a very rapid and aggressive onset that confined him to a wheelchair in a relatively short period of time.
Do you have a favorite song and/or movie?
I first read a book by C.S. Lewis 25 years ago, and I have been reading his work consistently since then. I know his voice quite well, as well as I know anyone’s; it is utterly distinctive. And the most dominant feeling I get when I read his early letters – that is, those written in the first 30 years of his life – is that in none of them does he sound like himself. That pre-conversion Lewis is, though obviously highly intelligent, neither a particularly likable nor a particularly interesting person – at least in his letters. He may have been delightful to know, but I doubt it. But once he “admitted that God was God,” it is as though the key to his own hidden and locked-away personality was given to him. What appears almost immediately is a kind of gusto (sheer, bold enthusiasm for what he loves) that is characteristic of him ever after.(131)

IWSB has been able to make a mark among the Young B-schools (IIMA research report of last year) in the short span of time, only because of outstanding faculty. Each of our faculty bring with them a deep passion and commitment to facilitating and bringing the best out of our students. They walk the talk. We have faculty like, Prof Navneet, who runs an integrated Marketing communication firm on the campus. We have entrepreneurial faculty to facilitate entrepreneurial students.
So guys, my advice is, try to not be frustrated or impatient with the women in your life when they voice their ideas, opinions and feelings. Most of us will tell you when we want you to fix something.
