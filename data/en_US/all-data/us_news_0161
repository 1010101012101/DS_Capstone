McVey, in his April 17 judgment of dismissal, wrote that he recognizes his ruling was harsh but that federal law pre-empts state law and, therefore, the loan agreement was not enforceable because the money was for an illegal purpose because the U.S. still categorizes marijuana as a Schedule 1 controlled substance.
Q: Were your first two wives interviewed by Jim Gray outside the courthouse after their victories over you? -- Jack Leibovitch, Towson, Md.

A photograph called "No. 368, February-March 2006," catches a hummingbird zipping across a patch of sky over dry hills. The jagged form of a dead branch reaches across the blue sky from the left foreground, as if to point directly at the bird. If Mylayne had taken the picture a split second later, the composition would have been a total failure.
Brantley has been examined by renowned hand specialist Dr. Thomas Graham at Cleveland Clinic.
"I am not a man of great stature or anything, why did they have to send over 60 officers to come get me at my compound?" he said.

Ron Paul is wacky, won't win the Republican nomination and must be giving Republican leaders a splitting headache.
“I knew from an early age that’s not where I wanted to spend the rest of my life,” he says. “I always had a sense of wanting to live in a city. But the great thing about where I grew up was you’re only a 45-minute drive from so many great places, whether it’s the Shore or the city. I spent a lot of summers down in Cape May. As I got older, I went into New York City often.”
Stern points out that being selected to his league's game, either as a starter or as a reserve, still means something to the players.
The couple added cantera-stone accents to match the already installed massive carved columns found throughout the 7,600-square-foot home. They hired a painter to hand-create exquisite designs of scrolls, leaves, flowers and fruit on many of the vaulted ceilings. And they added Old World furnishings, with carved wood and rich maroon and gold colors predominating.
Another factor in the frequent infidelities of politicians is the fact that they are often surrounded by acolytes -- adoring followers, campaign workers, office staff -- all focused on pleasing the politician. That adoration can stand in stark contrast to, say, a wife back home who resents that she's now the only one to take out the garbage, walk the dog and ferry the kids to soccer practice.
He drove for more than an hour before noticing a single outstretched arm. Some drivers like to camp and wait for passengers to come to them. Samarov would rather keep moving. The illustrations in "Hack," which have a fleeting, incomplete quality, speak to this — a couple taking shelter in a downpour, Blackhawks fans in mid-shout, cars curling through a drive-in.
Shawn Lewis, a spokesman for the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, said Superintendent Randy Dorn supports the bill.

"Since the economy tanked, food shopping for me has turned into a guessing game of what's behind doors one, two or three," says Karen Lefcovich, 55, of Springfield. "I'm trying to put more thought into how and where I shop, but I'm bombarded with sale circulars from stores that all promise the lowest prices. I don't have time to hit more than one market a week, so it's always possible some good bargains are just down the street."
“Us together, from the ground up," he said.
Gov. Jerry Brown has been arguing almost since the day he took office in 2011 that voters should approve a tax increase to help the state solve its long-running fiscal problems. But to Brown's dismay, the November ballot may ask voters to choose between two tax hikes — one that he has proposed, and one that wealthy civil-rights attorney Molly Munger and the California PTA are backing. Such a clash would make it less likely that voters would approve either one. That might delight anti-tax activists, but it's a worst-case scenario for public schools, universities, courts and the state's tattered safety net.
That news did not make Tim Connor's day. He is a senior director at the Chester County Economic Development Council, which was integral last year in helping to arrange state financial incentives to keep VWR from moving to Delaware.

Utility bills are another big concern. Electricity, heat, telephone and cable costs seem overwhelming when a family anticipates living on the income provided by unemployment compensation.
Don't get me wrong, I love to watch beautiful things grow. Trouble is I have to do a lot more than watch. For some reason, my wife gets to work with the plants and I get the grass. I'm not complaining. Her job is a lot more difficult. She has so much kneeling, crawling, lifting, etc. All I have to do is feed, water and cut. However, the results are quite different. In a very short period of time she gets rewarded with multi-colored flowers that are absolutely gorgeous. We even have a pear tree that is very attractive and yields huge amounts of tasty fruit. Okay, so I am complaining.

And what about the role of New Jersey entrepreneur Peter Tien, who is developing another green-energy project with the city? He apparently introduced officials to Sunpu-Opto and was to be a partner in its American venture. Isn't that a conflict of interest?
Even the blended system, however, is highly dependent on federal funds. The plan assumes that the feds will kick in $41.9 billion, or nearly two-thirds of the cost  even though there's no money of that magnitude in the pipeline and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has declared war on the White House's bullet train plans.
While Matheny hasn't done much adjusting to his lineup, other than for injury, Baker took a bold step Wednesday.

• Jeremy Lin is ready for the next stage in his recovery from knee surgery, wrote Frank Isola of the Daily News: "Jeremy Lin, who had surgery two weeks ago today, is hoping to begin light jogging by the end of the week... 'I think he’s still on the bike and probably doing pool work, probably,' Mike Woodson said. 'But no jogging as far as I know.'... When Lin spoke with reporters last Sunday, he expressed optimism that he could return for the playoffs although he didn’t think it was realistic that he’d be ready for the first round."

Now, they are a much smaller medium than any of those things, but they have a huge impact, because comics are the creative genesis and source for so many kinds of visual entertainment."

Other zoos and nature parks are doing similar work.
The intent was to pay for public education with timber sales and grazing fees on state-owned land. It's almost a quaint notion 150 years later, because the cost of schools long since surpassed revenue from state lands. The department distributes splits $40 million to $55 million among dozens of school districts annually. School districts welcome any source of cash, but the Portland School District's general fund budget alone is $435 million.
And many reach into the medicine cabinet, swallow hard, and ask their children every morning to swallow a pill.
"The status quo is simply unsustainable. In our view, we have presented a plan that preserves both standardbred and thoroughbred racing in New Jersey while improving the position of the state’s taxpayers," said the panel, which called it a model that, once in place, will not require taxpayer capital investment or operating subsidies.
Also on the land are a number of farm animals, including a cow we had to walk around to get to the ziplining gear. (Cows leave behind other stuff to walk around, too. That's not the reason Zip Orlando requires closed-toe shoes, but it's a great side benefit.)

A menu with quail eggs has a certain we're-not-in-Kansas-anymore aura. And while Jersey City may not be the Emerald City, it is becoming quite the polished gem these days, and its increasingly young, urbane and demanding population sets the stage for real excitement in the restaurant world.
The Chamber ads are drawing a strong response from Democrats. In Ohio, State Democratic Party spokesman Justin Barasky accused the business-backed Chamber of being misleading in bashing the state's Democratic senator, Sherrod Brown. The Chamber is targeting Brown, who scored only 9% in the organization's "key vote" survey. They will be backing his opponent, Republican Josh Mandel.

Grant's Pirate Captain (that's his name) is all Hugh Grant stutter and "glittering eyes and glorious beard." As a pirate, he's something of a bust, even though his crew adores him. He figures he's due for the "Pirate of the Year" award. But he's always come up short in the booty and pillaging department. There's always a Cutlass Liz (Hayek), Peg Leg Hastings (Lenny Henry) or Black Bellamy (Piven) to beat him to the podium.
"Just because the school made a payment to a person representing a recruiting service, doesn't mean that person is a street agent," Buckner said. "If I own the Michael Buckner Recruiting Agency, and Oregon pays me $25,000, and it just so happens that I'm close to a prospect and his family, and the prospect signs with Oregon, it doesn't mean I steered him to Oregon.

New Jerseyans are spoiled by an abundance of truly good Italian restaurants. But Basilico is even more special, with a menu overstuffed with classics so superb that you can easily imagine them being prepared for the Vatican. These are old, old-school Italian dishes, and impressively executed. (Owners Mario DeMarco and Angelo Delbecchi, are from Liguria, Italy.) Basilico’s famous wild-mushroom soup is musky and earthy; pastas are homemade; dinners are rich and lusty. Desserts are legendary and extensive, ranging from the crisp napoleon to the creamy ricotta cheesecake, plus strudel, zuppa inglese and a daily soufflé. (Continued kudos to pastry chef Donna Sardella, who performs miracles in her teensy downstairs space.)

He, often more than a City Council member or staffer, is the go-to person for residents with complaints about quality-of-life issues.

DuPont (1-1), who earned his first varsity win, didn't show it. He just kept pounding the strike zone with his fastball, curve and change-up - 60 of his 88 pitches were strikes - and kept a Eureka squad that was averaging 7.2 runs per game guessing at what was coming next.
We use our grasp of long spans of time -- from hours to weeks -- to apportion our energies: Shall I surf the Internet aimlessly, or knuckle down and finish that report due tomorrow?

According to Lavender, the new calculations are a way to more accurately track students through their school years, therefore more accurately tracking graduation rates.
The “TRON: Legacy” soundtrack proves an enjoyable exercise in electro-classical fusion: Most of the songs are brief, string-heavy and ominous, and draw more heavily from Howard Shore’s moody soundtracks for the “Lord of the Rings” franchise than they do from the original “Tron” score. A few tracks do sport the unmistakable Daft Punk signature of flat synth bass and wild, digitally manipulated arpeggios over the top. “Derezzed,” “The Grid” and a few others threaten to take to the dance floor. That they never quite get there is a testament to the party-happy band’s restraint.
“Now is the time to end what started too many years ago.

Our system of higher education is staggering in size. In the United States, we have 4,500 colleges and universities. They enroll more than 20 million students from every conceivable location and background. They employ 3.7 million people, from faculty to maintenance workers to administrators to everything in between. Annually, they award 800,000 associate’s degrees, 1.7 million bachelor’s degrees, 690,000 master’s degrees, and 70,000 doctorates. The total cost is $460 billion.
But I forgot that it's only cool to get to a club after it's hopping, and we got there when it opened. Gaffe No. 3 and counting. At least we were able to get a good place to stand and put our drinks down. After more than two hours of nonstop dancing to a good DJ who mixed the latest dance music with a bunch of songs popular before I turned 20, we were ready to head back.
"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" , In theory, seeing Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy share the screen should be a delight. In reality, this seriocomic romp merely has its moments, but more often feels heavy-handed, sappy and overlong. Sure, it'll seem warm and crowd-pleasing but probably only to crowds of a certain age, who may relate to these characters who find themselves in flux in their twilight. Handsome as the film is from John Madden, who directed Dench to her supporting-actress Oscar for "Shakespeare in Love," it too often spells out too much, and features painfully literal symbolism like a bird taking flight at just the right time. Still, Dench does some of the loveliest work of her lengthy and esteemed career here as Evelyn, who's recently widowed after 40 years of marriage and struggling to establish an identity on her own. She's one of several elderly Brits who travel to a resort in Jaipur, India, that advertises itself as an elegant destination for retirees. In truth, the place is empty and falling apart, despite the best efforts of the enthusiastic, young manager who inherited the hotel from his father (Dev Patel of "Slumdog Millionaire") to turn it into a palace. Each character experiences an obligatory moment of truth in this colorful, bustling city, but the plot machinations in the script from Ol Parker, based on the novel "These Foolish Things" by Deborah Moggach, feel rather creaky. PG-13 for sexual content and language. 122 minutes. Two stars out of four.

It's time we understand that if the city fails, the entire region goes down the drain with it. We need a strong city to become a revitalized region, and we'd be wise to use Indianapolis' amazing rebirth as the road map to our own renaissance. Indianapolis's revival was built on the back of sports.
Time is not on the side of moderation or accommodation. The longer the killing goes on, the more radical and extreme the anti-Assad forces become. The intelligentsia that initially supported the movement will be marginalized by Islamic extremists -- volunteers from nearby Arab countries who can't abide Assad and his secularism. (Already, bombings have been reported.) As with Saddam Hussein, his late neighbor, Assad and his family have long been at odds with the Muslim Brotherhood and similar organizations. In 1982, Assad's father killed perhaps 20,000 in the Brotherhood stronghold of Hama. It is now payback time.

Romney was attending fundraisers Wednesday, with plans for more on Thursday, to prepare for what may be the most expensive presidential contest in the history of American politics. He faces a 10-to-1 cash disadvantage in a general election matchup against President Obama. Romney has been free to focus on Obama since Santorum suspended his campaign two weeks ago, ending a nasty primary battle that took a heavy financial toll and prevented Romney from stockpiling cash to use against his Democratic opponent.
For the first time this year, I noticed that many hotels now assess a varying charge depending on the number of days they park your car. At most of the places I checked, the daily increment was just $1 or $2, which is much less than the daily charges at most airport parking lots. As part of that trend, more hotels now offer parking up to 21 days rather than the 14 days that used to be about the top.
Daugherty suggested an alternate measure to apply a ban to unincorporated areas and let each municipality decide whether to also be included. He said he won't support any ban that exempted the casino. Two other councilmen oppose any smoking ban measure.

For most movie fans, a Spielberg film is technically flawless, with a great deal of heart thrown in for good measure. Too much heart, some would say, because they think Spielberg's movies occasionally slip from moving to schlocky, with the director manipulating emotions, going so far overboard to make his work resonate with family-friendly messages that he dilutes the material. Others think he is a master at providing audiences with unforgettable images and stories, combining the two in stirring fashion.

The bigger immediate relief is that the deal brings $620 million this year, another $620 million next year and smaller totals for the last three years to help underwrite the cost of transitioning to the new system.

"We knew from the training regimen she was setting up that she was working hard for something," Jan Bootsma said. "But she didn't tell anybody until she felt she could put it out there and it wouldn't be laughed at or wouldn't set her up for greater risk. She and her coach, that was it. When she said it, it was a relief, because you could actually talk about it and not dance around the whole concept."
The prospect of federal money has generated considerable excitement - and for good reason. Before now, the federal response to Missouri's "failed schools" has been to place them on undesirable lists.
It is easy to forget this sometimes, but Penn State is still a university. It is supposed to be a place of learning. There are 40,000 students now, many of them teenagers, looking at an administration that failed to help victims of alleged child sex abuse and rightly are asking questions.

Worse, nearly 1,000 inmates in Michigan are in administrative segregation, the highest and most restrictive custody level, and many of them are mentally ill. MDOC administrators acknowledge that the percentage of mentally ill inmates in segregation is probably higher than in the overall population. Prisoners in segregation are handcuffed when they leave their cells, eat off serving trays pushed through the slots of steel doors, and generally lack the few privileges extended to those in general population, such as telephone calls, contact visits and television. Some stay in segregation for months, even years.

3. In this specific situation, we would like to clarify the facts: A Portland Police Officer informed us of a car accident in our garage that we believe occurred at least 20 minutes prior. We advised the officer immediately call 911 because EMS have the mobile equipment to respond to a car accident. Before the officer left our Emergency Department, our charge nurse directed a paramedic to go immediately to the scene. She also dispatched our first responders, who are trained security staff, to go outside to the scene of the accident. When the security staff arrived, the police were already doing CPR. Then the nursing supervisor ran out to the garage. She saw that the ambulance and fire department had arrived and were actively preparing the patient for transport to our emergency room.

“I’m not playing the safety position, which at times has been a little frustrating,” Rolle said. “But when I say ‘all in,’ that means everyone’s all in. I’ve accepted my role as the nickel (cornerback) and I’m going to try to be the best nickel I can be week in and week out.”
Owner Maria-Gloria Sarcinelli imports the moqueca pots from her home city, Vitória, in Espirito Santo, where women called paneleiras make them from black clay and mangrove tree sap according to an ancient Indian formula.

These steps will ensure that you -- America's seniors -- get the benefits you've been promised. They will ensure that Medicare is there for future generations. And we can use some of the savings to fill the gap in coverage that forces too many seniors to pay thousands of dollars a year out of their own pocket for prescription drugs. That's what this plan will do for you. So don't pay attention to those scary stories about how your benefits will be cut -- especially since some of the same folks who are spreading these tall tales have fought against Medicare in the past, and just this year supported a budget that would have essentially turned Medicare into a privatized voucher program. That will never happen on my watch. I will protect Medicare.

There are lots of things you can do with the finished hearts. We attached pins to the back of some so that they could be worn as jewelry.

With younger children, it can sometimes be quite a challenge to train them not to touch certain items in the house, in other people's homes, in stores, etc. Surely your son-in-law doesn't think that just because he told them not to touch his collection, they won't. If so, he is in for a rude awakening, to say the least.

The D.D. Collins House was built in 1845 and donated to the city in 1998. According to the Uptown Collinsville web site, the home was built by Daniel Dove Collins, a Madison County judge and the first president of the Collinsville Village Board (he was not related to the Collins family that founded the city).

The ultimate goal, according to the city's Historic Preservation Commission, is to create interpretive displays and open the house to the public.

"I wanted to wear a beautiful dress that had some meaning to it," said Cameron, whose 2010 Oscars gown was the first Red Carpet Green Dress winner. It was made from fine hemp silk dyed "Avatar" blue and lined with material salvaged from another dress. A collaboration of unknowns and heavy hitters, the "Avatar" dress was designed by a student at Michigan State University and built by Deborah Scott, who won an Academy Award for costume design in "Titanic."

What I remembered best about the Welcome Home Heroes concert, which I watched, exhausted, right after finishing Finals Week at college, was how different Whitney Houston seemed at the Naval Air Station than she did at the Super Bowl. This was a looser, funkier, bluesier version of the singer than I'd ever seen before. I was surprised.

The Norfolk show brought it to the surface. She had rappers onstage with her, and a much groovier band than the one that cut the singles we all knew. Or maybe it was the same band, but they'd just gotten better. As for Houston herself, she didn't necessarily seem like the good girl of the famous videos. I was smitten with the good girl Houston (who wasn't?) but I had to admit that this version rang my bell, too.

With "Rock and Roll" in my arsenal, I suspect I could shave all kinds of time off my races, and become a better peloton cyclist, simply by teaching myself to ride more efficiently. There's a psychological element, too: the less I thought about balance, the longer I stayed upright.
On the other end was LeBron James.
"Let's be honest," Brown said with a smile. "The low rates have made this all possible."
"I did not take a racial connotation from Wilson's remarks," said Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, who introduced the resolution.

Of the many good things about "The Five-Year Engagement," the most curious is the illusion it creates that nothing special is happening, that things are just flowing along, and that it's just like life. Onscreen, people are apparently going through something, and we're watching them, but it's all very easy and unforced.
"In any given year, we get about 2,500 individual donations," Thome said Tuesday. The infusion of new donors has come not only from online, but from people stopping by Planned Parenthood clinics throughout the region with checks in hand, she said.
It was an historic season for Telecommunications and Young has helped build the program from a team that struggled to compete into the PSAL Class B champions. The title and the Brooklyn-B-VII division crown were the first in program history and they didn’t come easy having to beat James Madison in three of their four meeting to do so. Young helped players like senior Sayla Flores develop into one of the PSAL’s top goal scorers and he proudly watched senior goalie Maureen McCarthy be the hero of the shootout in the final.
Because while we, as a society, still pay lip service to appreciating honesty, loyalty, marital fidelity, not getting involved in protracted land wars in Asia, etc., the reality is that today if there's money to be made, you can almost always find some ethical wiggle room. Just ask the record producer creating a "mashup" from two existing songs, the movie studio subjecting an entirely new generation to the idiocy of Moe, Larry and Curly or the author "updating" Jane Austen's classic novel, "Pride and Prejudice," by turning the Bennet sisters into an invading species of interstellar vampire supermodels.
That was determined by a formula that uses the best guesses on current market conditions to show how a development might affect the budgets of the city and school district.

The agency found that TV advertising is still a potent vehicle capable of swaying public opinion. In the case of Groupon, the social media commentary turned from hugely positive to negative after the online discount coupon company ran its controversial Super Bowl spot starring Timothy Hutton.

Yes, President Obama did invite James Curleigh, president of Portland-based Keen Inc., to the White House recently to praise the footwear company for assembling some of its shoes and boots at a plant on Swan Island.

Candidates who participate in the rankings fill out extensive career questionnaires and sit for interviews before dozens of lawyers, including many who appear in the candidates' courtrooms.

That night, I put the ritual's protective powers to the test.
James is an Ohio native who has been treated very much like a king in Cleveland. The Cavaliers offered him more than the Miami Heat, though the tax advantages of living in Florida will offset much of the difference. He said on Thursday night that he didn't want to leave Cleveland, but it's pretty hard to support that contention when he didn't have to leave and wasn't lured away by a much larger contract.

It would be unfair to give the plot away if the basic story, and much of the detail, wasn't already known. The movie opens with the McCain campaign flipping out because Barack Obama has become a "celebrity" pulling huge, adoring crowds. Their only chance to change that is with the vice-presidential candidate. Mr. McCain wants to reach across the aisle to the conservative yet pro-choice Joe Lieberman. But the McCain team worries he won't appeal to "the base"—that segment of the electorate Democrats and some mainstream Republicans view as the human equivalent of radioactive waste.

Just like the Chiefs, the 49ers openly flirted with Peyton Manning. Alex Smith pouted enough that San Francisco gave him a big contract, but it’s clear the 49ers, Ravens and Chiefs are in the NFL minority. They are zigging when most everyone else is zagging, and this is either wheels spinning in quicksand or a bold move against the grain.

Yet large numbers of Democrats stayed home, including women and young voters who backed Obama in 2008. They were less enamored of Obama by 2010, as evidenced by a rally at Cleveland State University two days before this month's election.

'I'm confused," said Stephen Byrd, who didn't sound confused at all.

We can make Quick the favorite based on this year's performance, but you will find Miller and Thomas supporters in the hockey world who would say Miller's 2010 silver medal could give him first shot. At 38, Thomas is still among the league's top goalies. Meanwhile, Schneider and Howard are goalies on the rise. Both should be in the prime of their careers when Sochi rolls around.

Round 4 (pick No. 130): David Molk, C, Michigan. The Ravens have been heavily linked to Wisconsin center Peter Konz. But what happens if they don’t take him with their first selection? Molk would be a great fit. He comes with significant injury concerns, but he was healthy in 2011 and won the Rimington Trophy, which is awarded to the nation’s top center. Molk has the agility and athleticism to play in their zone blocking scheme.

On the bridge of the Cap Beatrice, the AIS tracking system stopped transmitting the ship’s position shortly after 5 a.m. By law, virtually all deep-draft vessels (ships of 300 tons or more) are required to continually report their location when transiting international waters, except where the ship’s security is endangered. In these rare cases the nearest vessel-tracking service must be notified. Traffic monitoring is required by international law, mostly as a way for large ships to avoid hitting each other. AIS is a line-of-sight signal, and reception on land depends in large part on the height of the antenna.
Q: What's the total square feet of retail space in 2008 in Cuyahoga County? What's the average square feet of retail space per county resident today? What percent of this retail space is vacant? And how do these three numbers compare to numbers from the Census stats of 1980, 1990 & 2000? I've wondered for a number of years how retail space could keep increasing while the Cuyahoga population kept shrinking. Happy shopping. -- Brian Gomez
The report supports rules New Jersey has proposed to improve lead poisoning detection and treatment.

Now known as SummerSalt, chaise lounges and day beds line a turquoise infinity edged pool. Across the deck, VIP cabanas sit small groups for snacks and sips. Perched on the fourth floor, the west end of SummerSalt overlooks the cityscape down 5th Avenue, a raw view into the Gaslamp that contrasts the chic, modern amenities up above. While similar in design to Float at the Hard Rock Hotel and Ivy Rooftop at the Andaz Hotel, SummerSalt resists the urge to rage, and instead keeps a steady focus on fresh food, craft cocktails and a chill atmosphere.

She said all the coarse conversations, the talk about drinking and sex are all “background noise” that jurors need to set that aside, looking at what Dimora has done – not whether it offends them.
One Bay Area parent, who does not want her name used because she doesn't want her 10-year-old daughter to be labeled as a bully, says she's worried about the child's sporadically unkind treatment of other kids at school, dating back to first grade. Trying to stop the bad behavior -- which has included hitting another student and repeatedly acting mean toward friends -- has meant numerous talks with teachers, other parents and the school principal. The mother has read a lot about bullying and done plenty of soul-searching about the family dynamic. But the family is a loving one, she says, where meanness is not condoned; she's mystified about the roots of her daughter's behavior.
The moral bottom line? Taxing small groups of people in order to pay for benefits for all of us is an unethical strategy. Especially when we're talking about a regressive tax on a group of people who tend, in California, to be lower-income and lower-educated. That's called class warfare, and Californians should vote no.

"This is a critical juncture for the city," said Slay's chief of staff, Jeff Rainford, who has been meeting with aldermen for months on the subject. "In a lot of ways, the city is a better place than it was. Tax revenue is going up. Crime is going down. We've gotten our financial house in order in every way - except for pension costs."
"It would have been a while before we would have been able to buy the boys new bikes, so this is great," he said.
"But there's nothing like trail running. It's great, living where we live, because this is a place (where) a runner can do both. We have all-weather tracks, the bike trail and drive 30 minutes (to Folsom or Auburn) for great trails."
Much of the 11-mile segment was finished years ago, but floods in 1993 and 1995 washed away parts of the trail right of way. Two large gaps were created by floodwater. The segment has been shown on trail maps as a dotted line.

Sacks expects San Francisco's Yammer to continue to thrive this year, buoyed by a trend of enterprise software becoming more user friendly.

"I have a list of to-dos," Richards told the Dispatch. "I don't think it's big changes. It's little tweaks, little things here and there."
How to handle failing schools was the other remaining sticking point in talks. As part of the compromise, the mayor dropped a provision that would have allowed the district to fire all teachers at a failing school.

Since the death of Clarence Clemons, Springsteen fans have speculated about how the E Street Band would replace its iconic saxophonist. The answer, it seems, is that Springsteen isn't going to try. The announced lineup of the E Street Band features Roy Bittan on piano and synthesizer, Nils Lofgren, Stevie Van Zandt and Patti Scialfa on guitar and backing vocals, Garry Tallent on bass, and Max Weinberg on drums. Violinist Soozie Tyrell and organist Charlie Giordano will play with the group, but aren't listed as official members.

Mr. Gross insists the doomsayers are wrong. Since the economic meltdown of 2008-2009, he says, the American economy has made a dramatic turnaround. Corporate profits, exports and the stock market have skyrocketed to record levels. The private sector has created more than 4 million new jobs. Tourism has boomed. The U.S. auto industry has come back with a vengeance, and GM is selling even more cars in China than it does at home. American farmers are shipping rice to Japan, soybeans to China and beef to Brazil. Apple, Google and Facebook are setting the standard and the pace of innovation for the world.

Abdullahi, 44, preens like a fine, glossy bird, creaming her plump lips, powdering her face, fluttering her eyelashes girlishly. Her smiling face, with perfect white teeth, peers out from dozens of photographs stacked on her desk and decking the wall of her office, where she heads the organization Voice of Widows, Divorcees and Orphans Assn. of Nigeria.

But there's a valuable takeaway for the rest of us here. Don't wait until you're home to ask a travel company to make something right. Had Robinson made her case more forcefully at the port, she might have been able to get on the ship. Unfortunately, Smartt would have been allowed on board only if she had remembered her passport or passport card. Double-checking for your passport before you leave? That's always good advice, of course.

This show was all about the performance. And with that in mind, Cee Lo was wearing a wig. A black curly wig, the kind that Michael Jackson wore towards the end that made him look even more like a Loehmann's mannequin than he did before. I guess Mr. Green had to have something to run his fingers across now that Purrfect, his $350-an-hour rent-a-cat is gone. Yes, he rented a cat because he's far too busy to care for a little precious animal. Such is the price of fame. Something to keep in mind, "Voice" hopefuls!

The possible disintegration of Europe's currency union was on everybody's minds last summer, but it hardly gets mentioned these days. Nations like Portugal could revive their economies (and inflate away their debt) if they had an independent currency that they could devalue, but they seem to place a high value on remaining integrated with their European neighbors. And stronger nations like Germany are willing to make bailout loans so their companies can keep selling German goods in Portugal and Greece.

Certainly, it is true that my daughter will not get a “typical” education. She will not get married and bear children to carry on her next generation.

"I'm certain they wouldn't want to rock the boat unnecessarily,'' Lamping said when the move was announced. "But the Cardinals did not get a competitive offer from KMOX that could match up to what KTRS was handing them. They're in a business. While I'm sure everybody around here, especially people in the outlying areas, were hoping they would stay with KMOX, I think this was a business decision that for the Cardinals makes sense.
Arcadia, which moved to Indianapolis from Michigan in 2007, announced just two years ago that it would add 900 jobs to its local workforce. Instead, the company has struggled through money-losing times. It lost $9.8 million on revenue of $20.6 million in the three months ended Dec. 31.
With college tuition increasing again last week at the UC and CSU systems because of state budget cuts, many other Californians were crushed by the cumulative costs of daily life in a "no new taxes" world. CSU's $1,o32 tuition increase means that a family sending a child there will see its tax windfall evaporate all at once.
“The Grey” arm wrestles rather than tackles the harsh riddles of manly existence that were so memorably anatomized in its fellow subzero odysseys “The Edge” and “Runaway Train,” and like those films it may be too conventional for the art-house crowd, yet too arty for the megaplex. I prefer to call it an unusually reflective blood-and-guts saga.

First, from 2011 to 2020, the administration projects total federal spending of $45.8 trillion against taxes and receipts of $37.3 trillion. The $8.5 trillion deficit is almost a fifth of spending. In the last year (2020), the gap is $1 trillion, again approaching a fifth: spending is $5.7 trillion, taxes $4.7 trillion. All amounts assume a full economic recovery; all projections may be optimistic. The message: There's a huge mismatch between Americans' desire for low taxes and high government services.

Actually, the gimmick was apparent even without the president's acknowledgment. He gave his remarks in a room in the White House complex adorned with campaign-style photos of his factory tours. On stage with him were eight props: four millionaires, each paired with a middle-class assistant. The octet smiled and nodded so much as Obama made his case that it appeared the president was sharing the stage with eight bobbleheads.
Inside the cooler Markey brought some 60 ounces of her own breast milk, stored in 5-ounce zip-locked bags, for Richter to feed her 11-month-old girl. This exchange, at a place convenient to both, is fairly routine for the two. Markey has more milk than her baby can drink, so it seemed natural for her to help another family.
The former high school phenom picked up six points for the Ducks, who needed big points out of this race to have any shot of defeating defending champion Texas A&M. Oregon currently has a 42-36 lead over the Aggies.

Julian Zelizer, an expert on the presidency at Princeton University, said the first thing Romney should remember in choosing a running mate is to keep it simple. The party will be especially wary of a flashy choice given the backlash over Sarah Palin, he said.
The prison guard union might be perceived as weak now, but Gray said cumulative efforts over the years are at least partly responsible for the high salaries we see today.
The legacy of Mr. Santorum in this race is to make plain the depth of the divisions within the Republican Party. Mr. Romney is the kind of candidate that the party had traditionally rallied around, but in a GOP divided among social conservatives, libertarians, tea party members and establishment Republicans, that was simply impossible. The interests of the party may now be so diverse that it is impossible for one candidate to appeal to them all at the same time — a problem more often associated with the Democrats.
"My credit was denied simply because the credit bureau showed that I am deceased," she said. "I had no idea for all these years that it wasn’t fixed."
Police received 178 excessive-force complaints between 2008 and 2009, though Johnson and some residents believe other complaints go unreported.

It would be one thing if Obama's plan to expand drilling for oil and natural gas was the end-all, be-all of his energy policy. But it's not. The expansion of drilling is just one piece of a broad energy strategy that Obama has sketched to shift the United States from fossil fuels and foreign oil to homegrown fuels and clean energy.

If you're faced with the sight of your ex-husband's name every time you lift your wrist or see an embarrassing symbol of your wasted youth glaring back at you from your mirror, laser tattoo removal is certainly worth looking into.

Yields on 10-year Irish treasuries rose to 8.24 percent Tuesday from Monday's closing yield of 7.94 percent. Higher yields mean more investor doubts about whether they'll be paid back.

And this second thing you do. You cover the Lord's altar with tears, with weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor from your hand. But you say, "Why does he not?" Because the Lord was witness between you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant. Did he not make them one, with a portion of the Spirit in their union? And what was the one God seeking? Godly offspring. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and let none of you be faithless to the wife of your youth. 16 "For the man who does not love his wife but divorces her, says the Lord, the God of Israel, covers his garment with violence, says the Lord of hosts.

The anti-bullying law faced a legal challenge as well. The tiny Allamuchy School District — with just over 400 students — in January charged that it was an "unfunded mandate" that imposed new requirements without funding.

Our waiter lovingly described the Korean hot pot ($15), which she called rustic street food. The crusty rice was accented with pork and toasted nori, with a quail egg designed to be mixed into the oily ingredients below. It was good, but heavy.

A Pew Research Center poll last weekend found the public evenly split on whether the Republican takeover of the House was a good thing; 44 percent said they were unhappy with GOP control, 43 percent said they were happy. But they're not happy with Obama's leadership either; the president's job approval was an anemic 47 percent, and 59 percent of poll respondents said they didn't consider him a credible leader on deficit reduction.

But away from the spotlight, Crawford brooded, complaining that he didn't want to play point guard and saying that he didn't know whether to be a scorer or a distributor. By the end of the season, Crawford would be more prolific on Twitter than he was with his shot, and his slumped shoulders and expressionless face made him look more consumed with his own deteriorating game than the plight of the team. He vehemently disputed the claim of self-centeredness, saying he should be allowed to be upset at himself for poor play.

"Wrecking Ball," then, turns out to be a worthy centerpiece to an album that gets three (rather than four) stars because of a merely workmanlike middle section.

As Spears’ life began to resemble the fiction constructed around her, a funny thing started happening to her music. That personality, so sharply (some would say garishly) drawn earlier on, began to disappear. On "Femme Fatale," her latest chart-topping album, the eclipse becomes total. Spears has been swapped out for a robotic version of herself who feeds typical dance-floor injunctions into a computer processor.
