Huxley also foresaw a disturbing partnership between the state and capitalism but didn’t anticipate how little need for government collusion sophisticated marketers would need to reorder society. In “Brave New World,” the state has suppressed all simple sports because they don’t require lots of expensive equipment to keep the economy humming. Instead, it relentlessly hypes complicated tech-y activities such as “electromagnetic golf.” A couple of generations ago, kids might have bought one baseball glove and one bat that would last for years. Today they instead spend hundreds of dollars on Xbox 360s and games that quickly become boring and demand to be replaced with upgraded versions.

Oden's frequent knee injuries emphasized the Blazers' need for a big man, thus cementing Aldridge for a long-term contract in the summer of 2009.

The chow: First, a caveat: Green Wok gets around meat by relying heavily on gluten. Therefore, the menu offers familiar dishes such as kung pao chicken and curry shrimp, with bits of gluten manipulated to look and taste -- kinda -- like chicken or shrimp. This seems to undermine the whole principle of avoiding animal products, but there it is. Chinese dishes emphasize texture as much as taste, and the gluten does a respectable job of mimicking the texture of meat. And those who are not fans of gluten can easily ignore it; in the Vegetarian Chicken Rice Noodle dish ($7.95), veggies -- broccoli, bok choy, mushrooms, carrots -- were the stars, with the gluten limited to a few slices. Unsurprisingly, the notable dishes here are the ones without gluten. Tofu in brown sauce ($8.95), served with black mushrooms and bamboo shoots, had two young tofu lovers battling for each chunk. Eggplant in tangy sauce ($8.95) was unbelievably soft, but saved from melting into pap by the sharply spiced sauce.

No doubt the proposal will stir anger in nativist circles, where it will be portrayed as a sop to undocumented immigrants, who are barred from obtaining driver's licenses and whose lives would be made a little less difficult as a result of this change. But in fact it's a reasonable policy. Police officers would still be required to impound the cars of most unlicensed drivers. The only difference is that those drivers who have no license but have a legitimate form of identification, a valid auto insurance policy and no previous violations would be allowed to keep their cars if a licensed driver were on hand or nearby to take over the wheel. If not, they would be allowed to pick up the car as soon as the next day, instead of waiting 30 days and paying fees as high as $1,200, as they are required to do under the current system. Beck's proposal grants police officers the same discretion given the California Highway Patrol and other departments around the state.

What's a burger without onion rings ($3.50)?

"We found the one that was in Antwerp," Friedman says, conjuring a hypothetical antique. "One other person in the world might get to enjoy that. But is it better for the world if we make 50 or 500 of them, so there's that many more people who get to enjoy it?" He recalls a conversation with the English antiques dealer Rebecca Hill, who has joined Restoration. "She said, 'The narrowness of that transfer of happiness always bothered me,' " he says. "There's an ability to transfer that happiness to many more people."

Senators had earlier indicated that they would stay late into the evening to air their grievances.
Audiences are, however, sensitive to the architectural magnificence of the Palais Garnier. They tend to dress up more for performances at the Garnier than at the 20th-century granite and glass opera house at Bastille, opened in 1989. Between the two sites, Opéra National de Paris has 1,600 staff and a budget of €170 million, of which €100 million comes from the state.
While at first it may seem like most voting-age citizens have this type of identification, this is not the case.

One local couple, Gunnar Moeller and Ngo Thi Thom, have converted their home into a long-term (and unadvertised) guesthouse. They don't usually host short-term travelers but they happened to have a vacancy when we met them, so they rented us a room and two surfboards. Their guesthouse — Hafen, German for "haven" — is so close to Non Nuoc Beach that we walked to and fro barefoot.

Two weeks ago the Cherokee County Board of Education struck back, voting 4-2 against the amendment.

Sometimes parenting seems like the hardest thing in the world, and not just when he asks me to explain how multiplication works. Watching my kids try and fail, even if the consequence is nothing more serious than a sad march back to the bench, aches. Which is why my immediate instinct in such cases is to rush in with comfort, a solution or a distraction.

The overarching rule: first is right, meaning the vehicle closest to a gap in traffic goes for it. Lane markings and red lights are mere suggestions. Against all logic, left-hand turns are executed from the far-right lane in an asphalt dance where the spaces between vehicles and their surroundings are measured in inches. Near-misses are constant, actual accidents surprisingly rare.

Living south of the race course and working north of it, I thought I had it figured out. As more and more streets were closed off, I started walking to and from work. So I've had a ground-level look at the construction work, which seemed really piecemeal — a grandstand here one day, a wall of fencing there on another — until Friday, when suddenly all the pieces fit together.

"We use them all," said Sandra Beltre. She worked with the architect on the custom-built home and is glad she insisted on adding more bathrooms than originally planned.
Sure, there's usually some leeway involved and a bit of tailoring to the individual. But at heart is the notion that there's a higher authority who knows nothing about you who's deciding what's best for you (and usually selling a lot of books in the process). George Carlin used to joke that self-help isn't really self-help if someone is helping you, now is it?
Senate Bill 3442, which passed the Senate and now is being considered in the House, requires plastic-bag manufacturers to register with the state and put in place collection sites in 90 percent of Illinois' counties by 2014.

Q: Hey, Mary Kay: In your mock draft, you speculate on a team dealing with Minnesota for No. 3 to obtain high-flyers like Blackmon or Claiborne. Assuming this happened, would the Browns be interested in Kalil at No. 4? They would have a pretty solid offensive line for a very long time with Thomas and Kalil and it all starts with the big guys in the trenches. -- Stephen Clark, Rolla, Mo.

Even though James' "talents" really were overwhelming, I know now I should have included the shadows as well as the sunlight. That would have prepared the fans for disappointment.

“We’re not protected,” Yost said. “We might need to make another move after the game to provide protection. There are a bunch of different scenarios.”
The tea leaves say Vincent Jackson is the Bears' man. But Vincent Jackson also may be the man for about a half dozen other teams. The Chargers have not ruled out re-signing him, either. The Bears have to have a Plan B in the event they can't land him though. Marques Colston may be that player. I like Colston a lot. Colston will be cheaper to sign than Jackson, and in some ways he is more attractive. Colston has outstanding hands. He is a clutch player who makes big catches when the Saints need them most, like on third downs and in the red zone. Colston is tough and physical and enhances his team's character. He is a great locker room guy, not a diva. Drew Brees loves him. Some teams will be cautious about Colston because he will be 29-years old soon and he has some wear and tear on his body. Younger always is better in the NFL. Some personnel men wonder if Colston would be as productive in another environment, however. He undoubtedly has benefited from playing in a domed stadium, in a spectacular offensive system, and with Brees. What's more, Colston has been in the same system his whole career. It is not unreasonable to suspect he would not be as productive in, say Chicago, as he was in New Orleans. But it would be unreasonable to suggest he could not improve the Bears offense significantly.

Last year, deep injection wells stored 11 million barrels of the fluids in Ohio.
Typically, Call said, the party's heaviest push to attract Latino voters comes later in the election cycle.

For months, debate has raged about whether Silicon Valley has been experiencing another bubble that can't possibly be sustained. The frenzy is obvious: New figures from the National Venture Capital Association show more venture money poured into Internet startups last quarter -- $2.3 billion -- than in any period since the dot-com bubble, driven largely by investments in social media companies.
It couldnt have been any other way. And thats how it played out at Bridgestone Arena on Friday.
Well, for one thing, there's Greta Gerwig, the goofily charming actress who emerged a few years back from DIY indies and who displays a kind of awkward grace (or graceful awkwardness) that sets her apart from almost every other actress. Gerwig, tall and beaming, leads a pack of amusingly smug coeds at a fictitious East Coast college, Seven Oaks. Her Violet patrols the campus alongside Rose (Megalyn Echikunwoke) and Heather (Carrie MacLemore), studying and satirizing the mating patterns of their less-enlightened sisters and the frat-boy numskulls they pursue - their "distress."

"Without a doubt the year after is much more distracting," said La Russa, who returns to St. Louis this week for the retirement of his No. 10 before Friday's game against Atlanta. "The year before is survival. You have no guarantees. Then, all of a sudden it's you against everyone else. Now you have responsibilities to everybody: an owner, new teammates, fans. It's like a 180. One is much more normal. Survival is an instinct. Forcing something is different."

The governor’s reckless decision to ignore the law is the reason that the Court has returned us to the very system he has railed against, nothing more and nothing less.

Lil' Wayne copped a surprise guilty plea today in a gun-possession case that could put him behind bars for a year, the Associated Press reports.
At issue is the practice of banks processing debit payments according to their size, from largest to smallest, rather than by the timing of which transaction came first. This drains customer bank accounts faster, causing them to pay more overdraft fees.

Although John Coltrane's early approach to the saxophone was rooted in bebop and R&B, he is perhaps best known for generating fiery, cascading solos that came to be known as "sheets of sound." By the end of his career, it wasn't unusual for such solos to turn into marathons. But that kind of individualism is in keeping with the tradition of finding one's voice in jazz.
Many wonder if keeping much of the core merely will postpone the inevitable — a full-blown rebuilding project that could turn away more fans disenchanted over the past three seasons.

There is little about Spirit's method of operation that benefits the passenger from a financial standpoint. For instance, most airlines are desperate for you to use their website to book a ticket to reduce their costs, but Spirit charges you to book online. It would rather have you come to the airport (during the hours its counter is open) and book there if you want to save the $10-a-ticket fee. Hmm, which would I rather do? Book a ticket from the comfort of my PC or fight the traffic to LAX, park and dash in and hope someone is at the counter?

The medical examiner's office has not determined the official cause of death, but charging documents show Tonya Hobbs suffered blunt force trauma to her body.
It's not hard to figure out why. With tolling, the principal users pay the costs of roads, and, as long as they keep driving, money keeps flowing. There is no reason to build political consensus around road funding because the flow of money remains constant as long as the toll lasts on a road or bridge.

Once the allergist knows what you are reacting to, he creates a regimen of drops that contain small amounts of those allergens. You give them to yourself at home every day; no weekly office visits for immunotherapy injections (that's the standard approach). Over many months, your exposure to the allergens is increased, and you may become less allergic (desensitized) to them. For some people, allergy symptoms don't go away, for others they become milder or even disappear.

The spring line will include performance t-shirts, compression top, compression shorts, fight shorts, training tops, pants and shorts, hoodies, track and wind jackets and various headwear items such as beanies and caps.
Now Nancy's analogy between dancing and church was beginning to make more sense. Contra dancing is obviously not like any kind of dancing I've ever done. Ballet, as I remember it from my youth, was all about perfection: we were trying to learn to embody every position and perform every step according to a Platonic ideal of what that step or that position is supposed to look like. Other forms of dance are just the opposite: all about self-expression and individual creativity. But contra dancing, like church, is about something else entirely. It's about community.

Hanson, a 34-year-old Swede, is an accomplished pro on the European tour who won twice in 2010. But most American fans will see his name on the Masters leader board and probably think the same thing: Isn’t that the boy band that sang that annoying “MMMBop” song?
The alliance's board has formed a task force to find a successor to McDonald.
Six years after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed casino gambling on Indian reservations, the first Indian Gaming Compacts were signed in Arizona. The first was for slot machines with the Yavapai Tribe in Prescott. By the end of the decade, every tribe had won the right to casino gambling.

For the dexterous, consider a waiter's-friend-style opener. Basic models cost just $5, but the Chateau Laguiole models from France (pictured above; $100 and up) are the ne plus ultra. A wide array of wood and lacquer finishes is available. Kirsten Dunst fans might want to score a limited-edition model ($140) made with small pieces from Marie Antoinette's beloved oak tree at Versailles, which was planted in 1679 and felled last year.
Hey, Mary Kay: Is it possible that the Browns were targeting CB Josh Robinson in the third round? When Minnesota took him at No. 66 maybe the Browns were possibly caught off guard, traded out to possibly target LB Sean Spence, and pick up an extra pick. The Steelers then snatched him at 86 further surprising us. I vaguely recall the Browns showing pre-draft interest in these two fast defensive players. I cannot think of any other reason why we took John Hughes that high. Even he was surprised. -- Joe Ceresa, Fairview, Pa.

Tony Dungy, who coached Manning and the Colts to a Super Bowl title, has said that the Colts wouldn't have released Manning if they didn't have the No. 1 pick in the April 26-28 draft. They plan to use that pick to draft Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck.

While I have a vague interest in the pop culture world of midcentury ad campaigns of "Mad Men," "Pan Am" taps into the aviation golden age I missed out on – the one that was launched with the introduction of the 707 in the 1950s. Back when the modernist Pan Am building loomed over Grand Central Terminal in New York, a visual reminder of the dominance of air travel over trains.
Ellison said that's nonsense: "As a body ostensibly voting on behalf of the community, we have the right to know who the board members are, where they live, how they voted and what was said in the proceeding. A hidden vote by individuals who themselves are hidden is not something that should be happening in this community or this country."
"Heavies … are usually lonely, ugly or mean," he said in a 1978 Times profile. "Most heavies are not intellectual. They're angry guys, they know they're never going to go anywhere from there. For them, Hollywood is a godsend."
Sands needs to play, still needs to grow. He also needs to find some center, get focused and get his too-messed-with swing under control. The main allure of Sands is his power potential, which thus far hasn’t translated to the majors. Maybe it never will, but it certainly won’t if he's riding the bench should Rivera get 500-plus at-bats.
