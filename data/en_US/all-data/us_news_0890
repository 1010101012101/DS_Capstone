Jimmy Iovine talks about Hollie's nerves and how she needs to appear more confident on stage.

Apparently, there are more than 40 million women in this country who are primary caregivers for a sick person. To be fair, there should be a "caregiving husband's" companion piece, because clearly there is some mirror image of the situation. However, the fact that women live longer than men would tip the scales to create a higher number of women in the role.

Plain Dealer fileThe Cleveland skyline.Last February, this editorial board offered our agenda for 2011 -- goals whose attainment we believed would make Greater Cleveland an even better place to live, invest and together build a brighter future. At year's end, we're pleased to report that progress has been made on several fronts, and that the groundwork has been laid to move ahead on others. Predictably, there are also boxes on the wish list that remain unchecked.

Prospects have dimmed that major oil consumers in Europe, the U.S. and Asia will drive down prices this summer by collectively making a large injection into the market from emergency oil stockpiles.
The author is particularly good at demonstrating how Lawrence's apparently instinctive anti-colonial sentiment, along with his genuine regard for the Bedouin spirit, made possible his successful leadership. At the battle of Deraa, for example, the regular British officers commanding the Indian troops who fought with Lawrence's Arab "army" were horrified at the way their allies despoiled and cut the throats of the captured Turkish wounded. When they demanded that Lawrence intervene with his men, he replied that "it was their idea of war." Later, he confessed to sharing the Arabs' contempt for the Indian troops: "At least my mind seemed to feel," he wrote, "in the Indian troops something puny and confined ... so unlike the abrupt, wholesome Bedouin of our joyous Army." However, as Korda notes, "what Lawrence dismissed as 'subservience' may merely have been the behavior of trained, professional troops, who knew the meaning of the phrase 'good order and discipline.'"

Climb to the top of the Hollywood sign or gaze from the skyview seats above home plate at Dodger Stadium or hoist yourself onto the bench atop Runyon Canyon, and the City of Angels spreads her wings to the horizon. The hundreds of neighborhoods melt into a gently rolling forest dotted by skyscraper mountains where even the freeways vanish. This towering view of Los Angeles gives us the great, vast forest perspective in which we are all of one kind (Angelenos) and of one place (Los Angeles), but as with a forest covering a distant mountain, the individual trees — our neighborhoods — are invisible. If we want to know the rich flavors of K-town and Little Ethiopia, WeHo and Chinatown, Van Nuys and Compton, Brentwood, Boyle Heights and all the others, we need to leave the high ground and move into the trees.
Officials with the government's National Drug Plan have said growing marijuana in large amounts as planned in Rasquera would be against the law, and have vowed to block any attempts.
It's all conjecture, given the unpredictable whims of the academy voters. But one thing we know for sure is the Oscars are a great occasion for a potluck viewing party, with guests bringing dishes inspired by some of the year's big movies. In recent years, movies like "Slumdog Millionaire" (set in India) and "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" (set in New Orleans) offered easy jumping-off points for party fare. And for this year's party, look to France for inspiration -- three best picture nominees are set there ("Hugo," "Midnight in Paris," "War Horse"), and "The Artist," while set in old Hollywood, was made by a largely French creative team and stars French actor Jean Dujardin.

Many of Warhol's films are rarely screened, for reasons that would strike most observers as obvious. As the artist no doubt knew, it would be masochistic to sit through all eight hours of "Empire," a single-shot portrait of the Empire State Building at night in which pretty much nothing happens.
To claim your credit, you must file a property tax refund return form (M-1RP) along with a CRP to the Minnesota Department of Revenue.

That might be the Orange County coastline calling you — 42 miles of beach and beach towns, give or take, from San Clemente to Seal Beach. Follow the advice here, and this coastline might lull you with surfers on swells, startle you with circus tricks (look for the guy by the Huntington Beach Pier with the hammer, nail and much-abused nose), charm you with old shacks on priceless real estate, seduce or offend you with shiny new buildings on equally priceless real estate, tempt you with $2.69 corn dogs or $600-a-night hotel rooms. If you're lucky, at the end of the day, you'll wind up standing on a pier, surfers bobbing below and the faint funk of old bait hanging in the air, and these very coastal waters will swallow the sun. It's a nice trick, no hammer or nail necessary.

4. Cincinnati Bengals: In quarterback Carson Palmer's third year, is he ready to move this far up? With an understanding coach, Marvin Lewis, he could be. The Bengals already have the look of a good team with a tough running back, Rudi Johnson, and feared receivers, Chad Johnson and T.J. Houshmandzadeh among others. And Lewis, like Belichick, is a defensive expert. He is the first lifelong defensive man since Belichick to fully embrace pass offense, which gives Cincinnati an edge in a division with coaches who are still determined to run the ball. The Lewis passer, Palmer, needs more experience, to be sure, but with good coaching and able associates around him, he could, with his passing touch, mobility and poise, rise in a hurry.
All I did was with an eye to promulgating the ideas of individual liberty I had learned from various classical liberals and libertarians, including Ayn Rand, Ludwig von Mises, F. A. Hayek, Robert LeFevre and others. I added twists and turns of my own but originality never was my main goal. Rather, I wanted to make the ideas accessible and well-defended to those who were sitting on the fence or even opposed the free society outright.

Admittedly, this is not one of those storybook messages in a bottle. No map showed the buried treasure. No damsel in distress wrote it from a desert island. It contained no SOS to the world.

Three decades and 6,000 awards later, the program holds both prestige and political appeal. Winners boast of their Blue Ribbons 10 or 20 years after the fact, and elected officials bask in the schools’ reflected glory. Members of Congress often announce awards for schools in their districts. Winning principals attend a ceremony in Washington that resembles an educator’s version of the Academy Awards.

Moreover, notes Brookings Institution scholar William Galston, a domestic policy adviser under President Bill Clinton, the average voter thinks the Democrats are much more liberal than the average liberal does.

Sun Belt regions - hit harder by the housing crisis - generally have longer to wait while energy-rich metros from the Dakotas to Texas could return to peak employment this year, if they haven't already.

Sparkling wine is ready to drink when purchased. If you do store sparkling wine for a while, keep it in a cool, dark place.

Hearing and seeing the senator's decade-long opposition to the war in Vietnam, his refusal to compromise what he believed in, makes it all too apparent what is missing in contemporary Washington.

A. Feeding time is usually over for Bahia grass this late in the season. The cooler weather and shorter days cause slower growth and the beginning of dormancy for this turf. Since this is a new lawn, it is likely running out of nutrients due to frequent watering and an extended rainy season.

The next scheduled feeding time is March.

The June 8, 2012 event hosted at Embassy Suites Austin Central, will be centered on how to secure EB-5 funding from wealthy Chinese and Korean immigrant investors. The EB-5 regional center program has been a growing success, with much foreign investment pouring in from China and Korea. Rapid growth specifically in the Chinese economy has made the EB-5 program more relevant than ever before. The number of wealthy Chinese is growing at 9.7% annually, according to the GroupM Knowledge - Hurun Wealth Report 2011. Additionally, Merrill Lynch and Capgemini's Asia-Pacific Wealth Report 2008 shows that in 2007, high net-worth individuals in China placed 21% of their assets in real estate versus a worldwide average of 14%. The preference the wealthy Chinese show in real estate, along with the current drop in housing prices and a steady RMB, have made real estate investment in the U.S., along with the EB-5 program, more appealing than ever before. In the past five years, more than $3 billion of foreign capital have been invested into the U.S. through EB-5, creating thousands of jobs in a variety of industries. Nearly 70% EB-5 Visas are issued to Chinese investors this year. The Seminar aims to help U.S. companies and individuals tap into more of this foreign capital.

Narrowing a wine and cheese tasting down to one favorite vintner and one style of cheese is a great way to deeply explore both. For this tasting with a twist, we explore the classic pairing of goat cheese and its most compatible reds and whites. The occasion calls for a beautiful yet simple presentation that, like the food, expresses superior quality. We chose two favorite local California producers, Cypress Grove Cheese, known nationwide for their chevres, and La Crema Winery, acclaimed for their handcrafted Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays. Selecting individual producers who are specialists in their field is a smart strategy for both novices and connoisseurs alike. The sharp focus means that every taster develops an expertise faster and has the pleasure of tasting for nuance as well as for knowledge.

"If we're right and growth was overstated in the first quarter and we see payback in the second and third quarters of this year, then it's going to raise a lot of questions of just how much progress we've made over the past few years," said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, N.C.

Atelier is a new series of single-origin beans typically used in La Colombe's blends, roasted on antique machines at its otherwise high-tech plant in Port Richmond, and now being sold separately in limited quantities. On Friday, at La Colombe's cafe on 19th Street, they'll be giving away samples of "Blue Forest" beans brought back from Carmichael's explorations in Haiti. It's a distinct concession, considering Carmichael's published tirades against the "propaganda" of coffees from "single-origin Valhalla."

What Hom and Mu have been uncertain about recently is whether they'll be able to afford to fully fund sending both daughters to college. Cassie, 13, will head off to school in five years - the couple has about $15,000 earmarked to cover her expenses. The couple adopted Hong Hong, 2, from China in 2010, so while her education is much further off, they'd like to start saving now.

In his letter to The Sun on July 16th, Vince Tola takes issue with the term "illegal immigrants" in regard to the recent in-state tuition referendum. He states "it is more accurate to call them children of Maryland residents who lack official citizenship documents."
"Bluff is the opportunity to see one of your projects from conception to completion. I think that's something that a lot of architecture students never get to do," said Katie David, a grad student. "We work as a team to try and come up with the most economical solutions to materials and the best way to design something so it doesn't require as much resources."
Defense lawyers cited Posella's testimony before the grand Jury in May 2007. Asked at that time when Riley first came to City Hall, Posella told the grand jury, "That's hard for me. Let's see. I left in 2006. I think three or four years. I'm not sure."
The closest comparison with an existing local position would be with the job held by Chris Warren, the city of Cleveland's chief of regional development. Warren, among other duties, has served as Mayor Frank Jackson's point-man in dealings with suburban officials.
Bryant, who has drawn intense scrutiny for poor shooting and lots of it -- he entered the game leading the NBA with 156 attempts -- finished with 30 points, but they were hard-earned points, particularly in the second half. He made 13 of 24 shots and missed all four of his three-point attempts.
The music is entrance level college material, and while it is not unusual for Chagrin students to participate in Class A, it is rare that two freshman would qualify for this level

Supply allocation funds, a discretionary fund for individual schools, would be cut by approximately $500,000.

By contrast, after the 1981-82 recession, consumer spending averaged a robust 6.5 percent pace over the four quarters of 1983.
The second period was as one-sided as most college football games in September. The only reason the Flyers survived was Bryzgalov, our current favorite child of scorn. Whatever your opinion, you have to acknowledge this much: When the Flyers have needed him the most — as things began to crumble against Pittsbrugh; in the first period of Game 1, when the Flyers were shaking off a week’s worth of rust; in the second period Tuesday night — the guy has been very good.
Bruno Mars and the Foo Fighters tied Adele with six nominations each, including in the album of the year category. Critical-darling folky act Bon Iver scored four nominations, with two in the prestigious record and song of the year categories; and dubstep star Skrillex may have been the night's biggest surprise, getting five nominations, including a bid for best new artist.

Knowing that two contestants had to leave -- the one who lost the lowest proportion of body weight, and a member of the losing team -- Wornum worried his son and he would finish on the bottom two, and both would be eliminated.
Because of the two previous errors, the state is seeking an independent audit of finances, something Democrats called for in December.

LOS VAQUEROS: Trout fishing has improved. The South Cove has been the best spot. Power Worms or Kastmasters work best. Manny Reyes caught a 7.5-pound trout to highlight limits for him and a partner. Striper fishing has been fair. A 12-pounder was the big striper of the week. 925-371-2628.
Almost single-handedly, Pierce wiped out an 11-point deficit in the second half, scoring 36 points to carry the Boston Celtics to a stunning 87-80 win Tuesday night in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference playoffs, even with Rajon Rondo serving a suspension and Ray Allen sidelined again by an ailing ankle.

In ’09, the Giants were chosen to open this $1.2 million Postmodern Salute to Plastic (the exterior, anyway — inside it’s quite nice), and Manning ripped the joint apart for 330 yards and left town with his autograph emblazoned on the visiting locker room wall.
"I'm just trying to keep it simple. I'm hitting my spots. I'm healthy," Lohse said. "I feel this is what I'm capable of doing - keep the ball out of the middle of the plate, keep it down.

U.S. District Court Judge Kate O'Malley ordered the new voting system in July as a settlement between the U.S. Department of Justice and the school district.

After clamping down on its costs most of last year, Google has been spending more freely so far this year because management believes the U.S. economy is steadily rebounding, with electronic commerce and the rest of the technology sector leading the charge.
What: The second annual event again will feature three tasting sessions over two days with 200 breweries and 800 beers.

A Florida hotel owned by the St. Louis-based Roberts Cos. filed for bankruptcy today, marking the fourth time a Roberts hotel has sought bankruptcy protection since December.
• And as good as James was, Kerber pointed out, Anthony was just equally bad: "Fronting Anthony, helping and denying catches, the Heat — particularly Battier and LeBron James — frustrated Anthony all game, starting with an 0-for-7 first-quarter funk that became a 3-for-15 Game 1 nightmare as the Heat romped over the Knicks, 100-67. Without Anthony being effective in any way, shape or form, the Knicks offense came apart and tied the franchise single-game record for playoff scoring futility."

There are so many to mention, such as the Alan Gordon Chainsaw Massacre, but without a doubt, it's the Sunflower Goal. It struck deep for many of us in the Timbers Army. It happened in the 90+ minute of the last home match of the USL era. Not to mention, Timber Jim was channeling a higher power that night. Such a powerful and emotional night for sure. Pure magic.
The fate of the 18-ton, neon-lit orb has been uncertain since the Hearst-owned Seattle Post-Intelligencer ceased printing and became seattlepi.com in 2009.

However, just because a choice is easiest doesn't make it right, and many of these relationships don't end up working out. Cajoling a guy down the aisle isn't the way to a lifetime of happiness, and women should keep that in mind when they start eyeing engagement rings. Ultimately, a man will only get to that place of deep commitment and love when he is ready to and you can't ever force such feelings.

What will probably happen: If Carmona and Masterson -- another trade possibility -- stay with the team all year, they should each win 10 plus. If Talbot can stay healthy, he has a chance. If not, perhaps Carlos Carrasco and Josh Tomlin can surprise.

Who among us can see a 23-foot-long hot dog rolling down the road and not feel better about everything?
Meanwhile, it's almost laughable that local governments would complain about Gov.Martin O'Malley's legislation to discourage large new developments that rely on septic systems — at least since the Senate got through with it. The measure is still needed — run-off from septic systems remains one of the more poorly-regulated sources of pollution in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries — but the Senate has watered it down to a thin gruel (Example: Any development plans submitted before October will be excused from regulations for years to come).
Three "Opera Mann" numbers in one show is two more than we're used to. But since it is the home audience who will determine the winner, I can't rule Mann out yet. For his first performance, Mann teamed up with coach Christina Aguilera to sing Andrea Bocelli's "The Prayer," and say what you will about her nasty comments and diva antics, she does have incredible cleavage, which was on full display. All right, I confess. My prayer for a wardrobe malfunction went unanswered. Unfortunately, Mann's tribute to his coach did not include a descent into the muck with "Dirty" but instead was a snooze-a-thon cover of Christina's "The Voice Within." His hat trick of bland ballads ended with a version of Josh Groban's "Raise Me Up." And Xtina had the nerve to call Tony Lucca "one dimensional"? This seems like a calculated effort to grab all the elderly voters. Did we mention this was where the children's choir came onstage? Simulated elderly response? "Why, they're just darling! And this song is so slow and ponderous. I'm voting for Chris Mann!" Sprint Lounge Social Media Correspondent Christina Milan continued her unbiased probe of the finalists' parents. In case you're wondering, Mann's parents thought his performance was flawless.

"Alex always liked to think of rock 'n' roll as street theater, using all of the elements of theater as well as the music. He would study how theater directors focused an audience's attention and then apply these concepts to the band, from the set list to how to highlight parts of the band to the spacing between songs.
"An auto shop can give an estimate for a brake job, but people are not cars," said Jan Emerson-Shea, vice president of external affairs at the California Hospital Assn. "It's very difficult to get a random call from someone saying, 'I need gallbladder surgery, so tell me what it costs.' "

Berry got stuck with an inside lane in the open 400 at the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Championships, and Lananna said his time of 47.19 seconds there isn't representative. Lananna said the Ducks caught Berry's 400-split on last weekend's record-setting distance medley relay in 46-flat.
øInvestors willing to take on a bit more risk might target the bonds of companies with slightly lower, but still stellar grades. These bonds are called investment grade.

McMillan's point is that most opponents are having their centers guard the 6-foot-11 Aldridge, especially now that he is playing more inside than on the perimeter as in years past. Plus, McMillan argued the NBA has trended toward a more agile and sleek center.
The proposal is modeled after a measure passed in 2007 that extended living wage protections to employees at about a dozen hotels near LAX. Supporters said public investments in street improvements in the area merited the living wage mandate for the hotels, which did not have contracts with the city. Business groups sued to block the ordinance, but it was upheld in court.
John Edwards admits he fathered videographer's child: Former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards has finally come forward to admit that he is the father of a child born to a videographer he hired before his second White House bid.

Still, ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and increasing them for those that create jobs at home is a good idea. Job-training programs for 2 million Americans are a good idea.

So is comprehensive immigration reform.

Cathy fits the archetype, yet she doesn't feel like a complete person. She speaks almost exclusively in inspirational one-liners, including "Short, tall, fast or small, it's our voice that makes us one," and "Dreams are for everybody."

of the same mind as your coach. The proof for that claim isn't great. They also claim that stretching enhances performance. That's another statement for which proof isn't great. Gymnasts, hurdle runners, dancers (it is a sport) and perhaps baseball pitchers might get an advantage from increased flexibility, but the average player doesn't gain a whole lot.

Of all the heroes of the anti-Communist struggles in Eastern Europe, Havel most successfully navigated the political challenges of democracy and free markets, remaining at the peak of political influence for more than a decade.

A stall in an airplane has nothing to do with the engines. It is a matter of the wings suddenly losing some of their lift and gaining a great deal of drag. A fully developed stall is something that no airliner is ever supposed to experience. There is ample and unmistakable advance warning.

Was the airplane too slow or too fast? Which instruments were reliable? In fact, except for the probes measuring airspeed, they all were, but unfortunately there was no single integrated display on the instrument panel that could, like Microsoft Flight Simulator, let the pilots view the airplane from outside. Such a display, by making clear what the never-before-seen combination of instrument indications meant, would have saved them.

Certainly, most teens and pre-teenagers these days are fully familiar with bad language. They hear it all day at school and on the Internet, to which most have wide access. The strong language in "Bully" undoubtedly helps convey the ugly reality of the situations in the movie — they are the unscripted words of the kids themselves — but they might not all be absolutely necessary for the film to make a powerful statement. With both sides in this dispute agreeing that the film has educational and societal value, it would be a shame for either to let a couple of words stand in the way.

This South Bay park, cool and shady even at the peak of summer, offers something new this year: yurts. A yurt is a circular, domed, tent-like shelter. It has a wooden floor, 10-foot ceiling and canvas sides and is sturdier than a tent. Each yurt features bunk beds with mattresses, a foldout futon and a wraparound deck. And it's cheaper than a hotel, ranging in price from $35 to $75 a night.

Best inadvertent Woody Guthrie tribute: Not the Boss', those were all done on purpose. Guthrie's name was a popular one to drop at SXSW, but few lyricists breathe life into the folk tradition as effortlessly as the glue-voiced Ezra Furman, recently relocated to the Bay Area from his native Chicago. Last year, Furman put out the excellent "Mysterious Power" with his band the Harpoons, but in Austin this year, he was on his own with his sunglasses, his bare chest, and his battered acoustic guitar. He barely bothered to tune it, and he ran an overdriven signal through an old amplifier at Lovejoys, but it didn't matter: his verse was so tight and lean that he held the attention of everybody who was listening closely. Promising to lead us through "the twisting hallways of the house of song," Furman played material from "Mysterious Power," his earlier band albums, and new material he's set to release on his own. Instructive verse: "I'm a Jew through and through/ and I'm about to write you a Bible." This is a singer to watch.

I needed for someone, besides my doctors, to tell me what I was in for and how to cope and get through this," said the 44-year-old San Diego mother of two. "I found all of that in a support group. The women (in the group) were the best thing about one of the worst times in my life."

Plenty of people fudge the truth about their age, whether to buy beer or project a younger image to potential mates.

The same report had recommended that internal affairs investigators and training supervisors get involved early on in officer-involved shootings and in-custody death cases, instead of waiting until after a criminal investigation and grand jury proceeding is completed. They suggested two models: an Internal Affairs overlay mode, in which internal affairs starts an administrative inquiry at the same time as the homicide detectives; or a Specialist Team model, in which a specialty squad of investigators only handle these cases and simultaneously work to determine whether the officers could have approached the situation in a way less likely to lead to use of force.

These troubling stories are in line with a recent audit that found widespread problems with the integrity of the billing system used by DPW to charge residents for water and sewer usage. In May 2010, 851 properties were included in the city's tax sale based solely on estimated readings for one or more years, the audit found. Some of these bills were for just hundreds of dollars, and a DPW review suggested that in at least one instance a property would not have been eligible for the tax sale if actual readings, instead of estimates, had been used. This alarming trend prompted me to introduce a resolution calling for a moratorium on listing properties in the city's annual tax sale based solely on unpaid water or sewer charges.
Felton not only is shooting poorly -- 37.3 percent from the field and 20 percent from three-point range -- but he has lost himself. He is no longer that go-go-go point guard we saw early in the season, the one who pushed the pace even off other team's makes. He is no longer that point guard who penetrates and finds someone for a layup. All he does is drift around the three-point arc, making the mundane perimeter pass, often without testing the defense.
