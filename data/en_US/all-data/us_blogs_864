One thing that really stuck out to me, is that God wants to be our source of peace. At some point in our lives, someone or something is always going to let us down. At some point, something that we put our faith in to, will let us down. At some point, something we have high expectations for will not live up to those expectations. Whenever we look to things on this earth to lift us up, it will always fail. When we put our faith in a family member, or a friend, or a political figure, or in a relationship, we will almost ALWAYS come away feeling unfulfilled. THIS is where God steps in. When you put your faith in God, and make him your "source" for all things, He will NEVER let you down. He will NEVER leave you unfulfilled. He will NEVER forsake you in your time of need. He will NEVER show you anything but unfailing love.

Keeping away from the five vices, longing for the congregation of the holy saints, adopting compassion and mercy and renunciation of worldly pleasures is the true way of life. A true Khalsa’s way of life is to never take intoxicants and cut or trim hair and beard. (Sri Gur Sobha, Sain Singh)
I am still trying to recover from the chills I had all over on Saturday night when I saw Les Miserables at the Fabulous Fox Theater. It was, in a word, INCREDIBLE! My parents gave me 2 tickets for Christmas and it was one of the best gifts I’ve ever received. I love musical theater, and Les Miserables is one of the most beautiful compilations of song in the world. In fact, I not only was covered in chills, but my heart was racing, it took my breath away, and tears filled my eyes several times. It is that good!
She needed something at her neck (the cut from the cartridge just has it plain) so I cut another one of the tail feathers, cuddlebugged it with the swiss dots folder, inked the edges and turned it upside down so now she has some neck feathers.

I read another blog recently about health care marketing. It talked about the top channels for conversions, then the top channels for complaints. The presentation, done by a combination of a pharmaceutical company and their agency (which means the agency did it and got the client to allow their logo to be used for credibility and camaraderie) gave recommendations based on their “joint” study. In a nutshell, the top converting sales channel was in person reps. The top complaints were online detailing and some other things. No problem there, the stats are stats, and they were presented in order of percentages, with the numbers clearly noted. (lets assume the questions and research were done thoroughly and correctly.)
But something happened two years ago. I began to recognize that the pressure was not just coming from inside of me. That it was part of how I was made, and that I had an obligation to step fully into myself and take writing more seriously.
If you’ve read ONE of my posts, you’ll know that it’s what I do best. In fact, if you know me at all (Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, in person), you know I complain a lot. I’ve never been one to try and censor myself online (though, perhaps I should), and today’s post is no exception. Hm, I’m not sure where to start, so I’ll start simply, with an effort to grab your attention (though, if you’ve gotten this far, I know I already have your attention…give me a break).
What else can I do? According to WebMD, I was doing the right things, massage tummy, avoid caffeine, take painkillers or birth control.

First of all, it is comforting for anyone going through afflictions to understand the law of compensation, or the fact that God will consecrate your afflictions for your gain. You are not suffering needlessly. There is a purpose and a blessing attached.
“If you’re a state legislator, you look at all your state’s programs and you say, ‘Well, we can’t make prisoners pay, but we can make college students pay,’” said Ronald Ehrenberg, the director of the Cornell Higher Education Research Institute and a trustee of the State University of New York System.

I do home health. This involves traveling to individuals’ homes and asking them a bunch of questions. Amid the vital signs and instruction on various meds or treatments I have to discern how things are going neurologically – does the patient know what day it is, where the visit is being conducted, what their name is. The classic person, place, and time exam. This is done with additional more functional questions like “when was your last bowel movement?”
What the hell is happening to me? I have a huge crush (no pun intended) on the portly Brooke Elliot, who plays the starring role on this hefty series (again, no pun intended). The show really does give you a mouthful (no pun, please) of entertainment, as it is “dramedy” that touches all the right buttons at the right moments. It’s got everything going for it, plus the fact it is one of the few shows my wife and I can watch together – she’s more of a soap opera queen.

Ah, here was some of the bread stuff. Tack, or whatever it was called. The priests at the Abbey kept it on hand for travelers and sent out shipments for soldiers. They were so lucky to get some of that instead of the real bread. Brulee had accepted it graciously of course. Creme was pretty sure the Draenei actually had meant that it was appreciated and really wanted it. She was also pretty sure that the Draenei had never eaten it before.

I was thinking about letting your blond hair grow out long until everyone said that you had a mullet. You got a much needed haircut courtesy of Aunt Cole. It makes you look so grown-up. I think that you are starting to look like a little boy now instead of a baby. Brings tears to my eyes. Oh my gracious how I love you!

At approximately the same time as the McGunigles lost Webby, Edna became affected by the contaminated pet food which was being recalled and pulled from pet store shelves. She practically lost her eye sight over night. I remember watching her run acre after acre one month, only to return a few months later and having to guide her from room to room after she’d walk into the walls of the house she had lived in all of her 13 years. Needless to say, Edna was retired from the life of a show dog.

In Kensington Gardens there is a statue to commemorate Barrie’s inspiration for Peter Pan. The sculptor, Sir George Frampton didn’t use photos of the Llewelyn boys instead he worked with a child model. Barrie didn’t like the end result since he said it “doesn’t show the devil in Peter.” I know Barrie was disappointed in it, but I got a kick out of seeing it.

On the way to service, Dave and I were listening to K-Love as we usually do at home, in the car, and at work. This reminded me to tell Dave about the K-Love NASCAR car. Yes, I’m a NASCAR fan.

Andy has been working on the nursery closet and we tried to design it to maximize as much space as possible. We were going to get someone to do it for us, but we ended up saving over 50% by doing it ourselves. We are becoming frugal geniuses! We weren't able to get a big dresser because the two cribs take up so much space, so we basically turned the closet into one big dresser. We are very pleased and I think that he did a wonderful job!

Funny feet on wooden sticks melting in the sun,
I woke up the next morning feeling SOOO much better. Yes the baby is still transverse, but I have decided to enjoy feeling that little head poking out my side instead of groan and I am just going to dip my feet in cool water (or my whole body if need be) when I'm too warm or extra swollen. I'm going to get lots of foot rubs from my hubby and just enjoy knowing that I don't have to do anything to fix my body right now. I will get back to my normal self. I've done it two other times. I am eating healthy and doing everything I can right now to make my job easier when I'm done and that's all I can do. I can't obsess about what I look like right now. I need to be thankful that God has decided to allow us to grow this precious life and remember that this really isn't about me. Yes I have thoughts and feelings and they are important, but there is a bigger picture and I can't forget that. I feel much much better about things. I am back to my usual self and I am enjoying this heat (and the breeze haha) and this journey. It was just a little bump in the road. I never even for a second regretted this decision. I never will! But I did for a few days wish that it didn't take so long. I know growing human beings (optimally) takes 9 months and that's what we all signed up for and once again I am excited that we are officially at 30 weeks and wow what a great point to reach. :) 30 weeks is a blessing beyond words. There are people who don't make it to this stage and it's so scary and can be so devastating. I'm so greatful that neither us nor Ali and Ben have to face that reality. I am thankful for where we are :)
If Japanese government leaders do not recognize the risk their nation faces, how could the rest of us be persuaded of the looming disaster? And if the rest of us do not acknowledge the catastrophe we collectively face, who will be the one to act?
I would think that most people, including Dr. McGuire, had likewise had that experience, unless maybe they just never consulted sources to verify claims. It did not make sense, in other words, to make a point of interpreting the APA guidelines in a way that would prevent this kind of helpful information from being published. It has not been an issue for actual journal editors, in the articles that I have published in social work and elsewhere.

I pretty much let L plan his entire party. He told me what time (noon), what food he wanted (pizza, cake, and cookies), who he wanted to invite (preschool friends, church friends, family, and cousins), what he wanted to do (pin the lightsaber on Yoda, Greedo blasting, Legos) and even where to put decorations and tables. So, that took a lot of the pressure off of me and he got everything just the way he wanted.

If he's right, the EU will go through its collapse this coming year, and money will flow toward the US - not because we're in good shape, we're just better off than they are. This will give our officials false optimism and make them think they're not stupid. The US collapse happens after that. He believes that war is certain, as has always been the case when economies teeter and fall.
Close to this is the Swayambhu Hanuman Temple, to which the lovely Sri Rama Pattabhishekam vigrahas were added in 1685. Here they put a nail on top of Hanuman’s head to prevent the rock from growing big but it widened sideways and now the silver kavacham does not completely cover the Hanuman pratima on the rock anymore. There was a young priest here called Naveen who goes to evening college, since divinity is his mainstay and other learning is secondary. Very impressive after many other young priests I have met in the past few years. He also advised me to go tomorrow to the Ulsoor Someswara temple Rathotsava around 10 am. He says that pratishtha is by Mandavya Maharshi and tomorrow is Pournami as well as Somavara (Monday).. he says you can tangibly feel the power there. To think I trek around the country looking for rishi – temples and there is one right here in Ulsoor!!

Siemens argued that the judge was wrong in construing its patent as meaning that the notion of "facilitating" carried with it any element of practical benefit or that the practical benefits had to be capable of appreciation by a practical user, and that he also erred in holding that the fusion of the coating to the board had to be by heat alone. Thorn appealed against the finding of infringement, submitting that Mann J's findings were not supported by the evidence, and also and also maintaining that should have given a more purposive interpretation to the word "assignment" in section 33(3), so as to cover the mergers of the sort that had occurred here.

My morning, as usual, included getting myself showered and ready to include my "face" and the actual ironing of my clothes, dragging four kiddies out of bed, getting two ready for school ie "doing" hair, brushing teeth, feeding bellies, sending fish oil down the little hatches which was followed by subtle (probably faked) gags, and signing off homework assignments that I should have done the night before, but such is life. Normally I would just stick the littlest two sleepy heads in their car seat "as is" but I needed to get them ready and lectured for their stay at my friend's house. (Little bunny trail..hold on) I wonder if Drs realize what we as Mom's go through to get to their offices...especially the ones who seem to think I quite *enjoy*it!

Kid one, Mac, is there because his folks consider him undisciplined and they're forcing him to attend to improve himself. He hates being there. He hates his folks for forcing him to go. He hates wearing the stupid, strange outfits. He hates the ranking system which is even more blatant than that of his school classes because you wear a colored belt which precisely describes your status at the dojo. He resents every stinking minute he has to be there. Mac is being taught aikido but he ain't learning a damned thing, if he can possibly avoid it.
The U.N.’s Agenda 21 (Chapter 38) states: “All agencies of the United Nations system have a key role to play in the implementation of Agenda 21.” Is the FAO, with the help of the U.S.D.A., implementing Agenda 21 in America?

In my time staying here at Community Hostel, I’ve made friends with every staff member and every guest that has ventured out of their room(s) (not everyone’s a social butterfly). The atmosphere created by the staff is more like a cool hangout spot than a profit churning hospitality machine, which is a really nice change of pace. The staff members joined the guests in some of the excursions and were very resourceful in assisting with making travel arrangements, late night activities and arranging cab pickups. The Hostel itself is awesome but I really think the people make it the place it is today, so a brief breakdown on the staff:

The once-powerful states, which created the federal government by ratifying the Constitution, have become -- in the words of Mark Levin -- "administrative appendages of the federal government." The states are subject to ever-increasing federal regulation, strangled by dictates from agencies old and new, and held hostage through billions in federal tax dollars. Levin asks, "Does anyone believe that the states would have originally ratified the Constitution had they known this would be their fate?"
Unless you have been in a cave or if you still confuse The Hunger Games and Twilight, then you most definitely know the plot. The problem is that if you hear the plot you probably envision a film that is a lot more violent than it actually is. Just like the novel the film never leaves it’s pre-teen tone. Even the more violent parts feel sort of childish but that is what the book is and I’m sort of glad that is what the film is. That is the first thing that the film gets right and gets wrong. It is a faithful adaptation of the source material and only messes with certain elements on rare accounts. Yes there are characters omitted and subplots adverted but what did make the cut are the book’s most important parts. I do feel like the script should of never went behind the camera but it does add an extra element to the story. Even though it is a great thing that the film is so faithful, the movie still felt rushed. Events and characters feel pushed forward to try and fit in some of the filmmaker’s own additions. The script’s faithfulness creates a movie that is a great companion piece to the novel but never allows it to become a work of its own.

Based on this visual approach and a definition it can be concluded that every indvidual involved in the tough mudder ‘business’ (participant, spectator, coach, staff) is part of the overall tough mudder community in one way or another (positive, negative, direct, indirect, etc.).
the meta-tautology of Black in Black targets a telos that is neither achievement nor consolation, but the intensive infinitization of arriving search, as if to find that reality itself is absolutely mystical: “since that which human nature seeks and toward which it tends, whether it moves in the right or the wrong direction, is infinite and not to be comprehended by any creature, it necessarily follows that its quest is unending and that therefore it moves forever. And yet although its search is unending, by some miraculous means it finds what it is seeking for: and again it does not find it, for it
Never let anyone demean the work you do at home. If you have small children, what better work could you have than to guide them, teach them, protect them and to show them, by example, how wonderful life can be? The home is the best place to learn life skills and to pass what you learn on to your children. As children grow, they still need you as their guiding light. Teenagers will benefit from knowing you're there when they come home from school. Giving them your time, in addition to your never ending love, is the best investment in their future.
Rest in peace.

My own daughter followed in the family tradition, and devoured books from an early age. She both reads and writes good stories and poems, in which her love of words shines through. She too had a much loved Golly, made by me, and she wasn’t at all put off when reading the stories of Enid Blyton, who painted him as a mischievous, sometimes sinister character.
Then for the first time he turns round to me and, with a helpless look on his face, asks if he is on the right train for Yarmouth. His face looks surprisingly old. He is not a twenty-something but a well-worn forty-something. His hair is patchy and thinning. He hadn't taken in anything the conductor said. He looks friendly but wild, or perhaps that should be wild but friendly. I tell him what the conductor said. He asks me if we are in Norwich yet. I tell him this is only Thetford. I tell him he has a tight connection at Norwich, which is the last stop, and that he'll have to dash across to platform five, and that he should really be in the front carriage. He experiences a moment of relative lucidity. He rises and lurches off towards the front carriage. An Asian boy in the seat behind me grins at me. The big man is gone.

The real culprit is - as ever in situations involving 'crazy' health & safety advice and paedo hysteria meaning school trips can't take place unless all the accompanying parents are either castrated or otherwise neutered - is the gut-wrenchingly risk-averse and litigious nature of British society, in part imported from across the pond.
My blogging absence has been purposeful. In trying to keep above the toxic rancor it seemed better to be silent than to add to the cacophony. However, there have been several occurrences that have convinced me that silence is the wrong option, and that now more than ever is the time to voice concerns and thoughts.
April is Sexual Assault as well as Child Abuse Awareness Month. This month shines a light on issues that most people would prefer to pretend don’t happen, on issues we’d rather joke about or distance ourselves from by making them something more casual. However, the campaign slogan for 2012 Sexual Assault Awareness Month is “It’s time to talk about it” and if we’re ever going to live in a world without sexual violence, it is time to talk about rape and sexual abuse as just what it is and what it isn’t:

Marlene Coudray has without a doubt created a far bigger storm than this tea cup partnership can contain. Like many others, when Marlene jumped ship…or was poached…depending on how you want to look at it, I was unperturbed. I live through Rupert Griffith and Vincent Lasse crossing the floor, Marlene Coudray go stun me?

Time will tell how much the Northcross Walmart will (or won't) alter the characteristics of its immediate surroundings. I haven't noticed much difference in traffic during my morning and afternoon weekday commutes on Burnet yet. The holiday season should provide a more meaningful snapshot of how the store will impact area traffic patterns.

Although one Valemax vessel, the Berge Everest, was allowed to unload in the port of Dalian in December, the announcement from the Chinese ministry of transport said that ports will no longer be able to decide whether to accept large ships on a case by case basis.

Inside, there is a wall dedicated to the Brooklyn Dodgers. There was one photo in particular I never saw before, of a Yankee and Dodger vendor together, hawking their goods. Outstanding! I thought I saw them all. By this time, John's father had arrived, JOE. John introduced us as I thanked him kindly for the intrusion. I was stumbling over my words because you just couldn't pen a better script. Joe also seemed quite agreeable with letting me post this wonderful encounter as I clicked away with delight. Another frame contained a local newspaper clip celebrating the Legendary DODGER Sym-PHONY BAND. God bless their Brooklynite hearts. They made their way out to a Brooklyn Cyclones' game a couple of years ago. I hope they're well!
This is a right and a form of IP protection and demand to disallow misrepresentation that the country is a part of the UN. Some countries of course are guilty of abuses that have warranted the above actions though the intent towards international hegemony via the UN, or (recognition of microstates that skew the representation of votes by population) is equally unacceptable.
I look around me, and I have many friends who are now married. I have friends who are now having kids (CONGRATULATIONS, I'm very happy for you guys!). I have friends who are well established in their careers, and are "moving on up", or continuing to pursue higher and higher avenues for success. But I also look around me and see many others that staid. Working this job or that, or not at all, and basically just floundering waiting for a big ah-hah to finally send them on their journey. Life is happening right now, and we need to take full advantage while we've got it.

His eyes lit up. He immediately wanted to write a letter and had two friends he wanted to write to. So he got paper and I showed him how a letter is set up and he went to town. He finished the letter and I read it out loud to him. He found the parts that didn't make sense. (And the parts we couldn't even read.) and fixed it.

I have learned that I can still be kind and generous and still put myself first. I’ve realized I’m allowed to create limits for myself, I’m supposed to create limits. Limits are healthy. I can set limits on how generous I can be and still generous. I have learned by not setting limits, I end up being too generous and I give myself away bit by bit; which is not either healthy or balanced. And in the end, I feel resentment toward the object of my generosity.
No one factor explains why some people only dream of migrating, while others go. Many factors can influence the situation. Potential migrants’ personal circumstances such as their finances, health, family situation, and their job status can keep them home or push them out the door. Migration policies — or lack thereof — can also create so many roadblocks to leaving or entering a country that potential migrants become discouraged. Yet Gallup’s surveys show millions are actively preparing to leave their homelands for good — and it is often the best and brightest that their homelands would like to see stay.

There is a war raging throughout the continent of Africa, a war between Islam and Christianity. It is fueled by both American and former Soviet weapons and funding, but now also includes the Chinese. Each “Super” power has a stake in the wealth of Africa. Staggeringly absent? The American press! Below are three articles among many online – NONE by American journalists – NONE printed by American papers! Curious?

For as long as Community trade marks have existed it has been possible to register shapes as Community trade marks (Article 4 of Community Trade Mark Regulation 40/94, re-enacted in the consolidating Regulation 207/2009). Article 7(1) of the same Regulation sets out absolute grounds for refusal to register a trade mark. These grounds include signs which consist exclusively of the shape of goods which is necessary to obtain a technical result (Article 7(1)(e)(ii)). A shape mark which is barred from registration Article 7(1)(e)(ii) cannot become registrable by acquiring distinctiveness through use because it is not listed in Article 7(3) in the categories of marks which are capable of acquiring distinctiveness.
I nabbed my first target with help from my roommate’s brother. I received a text alerting me that my target was in the caf, wearing a grey shirt and drinking orange soda at the same table as my roommate’s brother. When I got him, I received a general round of applause from my friends in the caf at the time.

I think it's really important for everyone to have an affirmation that will lift their spirits when challenges seem insurmountable. If you don't have one yet, I really suggest writing one for yourself! It can be as simple or complex as you like; this one is rather long, but another mantra of mine that I find myself falling back to time and again is as easy as "Breathe. You can do this." The important part of your affirmation is that it reminds you of everything you're striving for and how amazing your life will be once you accomplish these goals. It'll get your through difficult times and remind you that whatever you're living through at that moment, no matter how dire it seems, will someday be one more challenge you've learned and grown from.

A UK Government is democratically elected to look after the best interests of the nation and of its citizens, not to abuse and persecute the sick in favour of foreign corporate profits by imposing the “biopsychosocial model” that is promoted by UK psychiatrists who have vested financial interests in such a “model” because they work for the health insurance industry, whose profits benefit from its use.

An other protestant twinge is their act to want to go more to the Biblical teachings instead preferring to keep to human doctrinal laws. We can notice that they manifesters turned to the Bible for guidance about church governance.
Kane leaps back and forth in time as a reporter (William Alland) searches through newsreels, diaries and interviews with friends, enemies, ex-wives and employees to try to pin down the secret of Charles Foster Kane.

Adam: “It’s fascinating to see how quickly Auster has gone, in your view, from being an indispensible mentor to Tel Aviv’s Satanic puppet. I suggest that this speaks to nothing but the rapidity of your descent into Jew-hatred.” It’s fascinating to see how such insightful and intelligent people, judging by your conversation with Auster as Paul T., can become so dishonest and duplicitous when dealing with criticism from outside. You find it convenient to assume I am driven by “Jew-hatred”. This permits you to evade the truth. Liberalism and PC have arisen, and accelerate, precisely as Whites lose power and Jews gain it.
I admit, I was a little confused by the directions on the above website. I felt like I was missing something or I just didn't get something, so I modified it a little bit. I also added some cardboard in between the layers of the large rectangle pieces to give it some stability. The cardboard is a little smaller than the rectangles and it kind of bothers me, but I am sure it will fit the bill of what she is going to use it for.

A few weeks ago I bought a small container of couscous salad from the grocery store. When I pulled it out of the bag, The Hubs gave a weary look and quietly asked, “Is that…?” He suddenly stopped mid-sentence and I silently nodded as I scooped two small spoonfuls on our plates, but skipped Lil’ Man’s dish and thanked God Sweet Boy was still too young for solids. Maybe we’ll have couscous again as a family once the boys are off to school – as in off to college – but until then it’s the side dish that-must-not-be-named.

How the heck are you supposed to prepare to go to Haiti in three days!? Along with having to get various vaccinations, the doctors and nurses each had to bring two giant bags full of medical supplies. That was crazy. My mom went to the hospital to scrounge supplies and just threw in as much as she could into those poor bags. Then she came home and to take everything out and repack it in an intelligent fashion (not just throwing it in). It was one of the strangest things I have ever seen- our entire living room, swamped with various medical supplies. As well as gathering supplies, the team leader told everyone to take ten days worth of protein bars, because it wasn't guaranteed that they were going to have food there. Oh, and everyone also had to take pills that would hopefully prevent them from getting Malaria, as well as bug spray to prevent Malaria-infected mosquito's from biting them.
Calm voices. Now this is something God has really been whispering into my ears. When we allow ourselves to get angry and lash out, or allow ourselves to almost float out of control it is hard to be joyful. THIS WAS A HUGE HELLO- OUCH for me!

In a skillet, cook bacon that has been cut into small pieces. As the bacon is cooking add very small diced onion. Saute on medium high heat until onion is carmelized and bacon is crispy. Add minced garlic and cook for a minute or two more. Add the sweet potatoes and beets to the bacon and onions and stir.
I entered a pie contest that is this week and now I'm wondering what I was thinking?! But I guess it'll be fun. I decided on lemon meringue. I just hope it turns out at least semi-good and doesn't fall apart that day!! This was one of my two practice pies I made and we ate!

I remember cooking in my kitchen...Marc Broussard on full volume, the melody, the sway, the words overshadowing my own, pots and pans making racket like ghosts in the attic, bent on driving the living from the halls of entitlement. It was only a stage...a brilliant light before the filament breaks a bone and darkness comes unexpected. This silence holds no distraction. There are no more shades on the windows, and filters are a thing of the past. This is where the mortar and pestle meet...in the coveted silence. Rubber v. Road. Truth v. Wish. The full monty.

Not quite Halifax, but it will get me out of town for a while, I called it in and started towards Hainnesville. I tried to make conversations with the guy but he wasn't very talkative. The most I could get out of him was a couple of grunts and a few strings of mumbled sentences when I asked him what he does for a living. Other than that, all he did was rock back and forth and chew on his knuckles.

The particular constellation of forces that have led Greece to its present position originate in Brussels as well as in Berlin. At the European level, there is a conscious project at work. The European Union is, at bottom, an attempt by European capitalists to remold their societies to be more like the United States, with its extreme disparities in wealth and privilege. An impediment to such a goal is that people across Europe have the habit of asserting themselves, not only to defend their social gains but sometimes to push forward. There was a general strike in Denmark in 1998, as an example, in which one of the key demands was for a sixth week of paid vacation. (We in the United States ought to let that one sink in.)

The queen of Sheba came in all her majesty with a great train, camels, spices, gold and precious stones, she then asked Solomon the hardest questions she had. Solomon told her the answers to all her questions barring none. When the queen saw the Solomon’s wisdom and the majesty of his kingdom – his house, his servants, she was lost for words. She admitted that what she had heard was not up to half of what she now witnessed by herself. She concluded that happy are the servants who stand continuously before Solomon and hear his wisdom. She then gave gifts to Solomon in golds and spices before departing back to her own land.

The one thing I do tend to describe in detail is violence, but that’s a deliberate policy. I think so long as it isn’t self-indulgent or pornographic, it’s important to show the reality of violence. I loathe books and films where violence has no consequence, where it’s bloodless, where it doesn’t hurt. I do think Firebrand is quite violent, but I also hope and believe the violence has moral and physical consequences for both the victim and the perpetrator.

"We are really excited to be able to present the complete version of Bone Palace Ballet," says CHIODOS lead vocalist CRAIG OWENS. "Our fans have always supported us in everything we've done and I can't wait for them to experience the definitive release of Bone Palace Ballet: Grand Coda."
I'm wondering who put it together and why. It can't have been an early, rejected attempt at a "White Album" cover -- the Beatles would never have commissioned something so cheesy by 1968. Still, it's amusing... and interesting for the track list. What if the "White Album" had been a single, not a double, album? According to this cover image, the line-up would have eliminated the more idiosyncratic songs (which surely would have ended up later on solo albums).
It’s always nice to see guests arriving and greeting the groom, it was lovely to see just how pleased everyone was for the happy couple. Watching the look on Tony’s face as he waited for his bride it was clear to see the love they share. Their infectious happiness that refused to be dampened by the rain (pardon the pun) was the perfect example of how a positive attitude can overcome any weather conditions, we even managed to pinch 15 minutes outside for a few group shots!

Cell phone specials differ from agent to help operator. Therefore, it is generally a very good concept to help analysis a little before zeroing throughout upon cell solutions involving a certain user.

So…. Robin got a top three callout? Strange? Not. I actually like Robin, despite all her imperfections. I thought she was hilarious on the show, and had good photos for the most part. Back to this, I love it. Her stomach looks great, her age, height and weight considered and I love the swimwuit shes wearing even if the pose isnt good. Ill also give her props for her face, which is probaly the best part of the photo, its so dreamy and gorgeous, and she managed to look younger than her 26 years.
She then pointed out a number of other weeds, identifying them for us, defending their existence, and then telling us to pull them out. Clearly, medicinal weeds have a place in her heart, but not always in her garden. The dandelions stay, she said. They pull up lots of good nutrients and make a good border for the garden and field. The cleavers go. And the horsetail-- God help us-- pull the horsetail. Throw it to the road.
Many of the firsts are happy - the first smile, the first step, the first word. Firsts, however, can be sad as well. I'll always remember our oldest daughter's first day of school.

Didn’t think so. Well, unless you live in Ireland (actually you probably still don’t because this band is in America and plays Irish music), in which case you might know… But I’m from America, here no one knows!

The digital library notified me this week, my WMA audio file for Liesl & Po was available. I greedily downloaded it as soon as I could get to my home computer. I absolutely adore Lauren Oliver's poetic writing style. This book, even though geared for a MG audience, was no exception. I almost devoured the entire audiobook in less than 24 hours. Such an utterly captivating piece! Plus, the audiobook reader was the infamous Jim Dale! He was the perfect voice for such a tale.

The Sheriff’s Office says there is not a threat to the community. Investigators have spoken with the resident of the apartment and no charges has been filed at this time. The hitch in this last case is that Douglas Williams, the 29-year-old who shot the two intruders, was not supposed to be carrying a weapon, as a convicted felon. Nonetheless, he seemed to believe the Stand Your Ground law applied to him too.
From Jamie: This is such a tough decision! I have about half-a-dozen beloved and dog-eared books that inspire me to be free, creative, honest, and confident in my writing. Because her book is the one currently within reach, I’ll go with Brenda Ueland‘s classic, If You Want to Write - A Book about Art, Independence and Spirit. Much more than a pep talk for writers, this book is a manifesto for releasing the creative spirit that lives inside each of us. Though it was originally published in 1938, it is as relevant today as ever.
Well we didn’t hide under the duvet. We went to turn in our old vacuum cleaner as the new one had a trade-in offer. And we stopped for a cup of coffee which gave hubby and I a chance to have a board meeting. We have been having meetings with our architect regarding building work. The changes mean a lot of planning. And the possibilities are endless. Our architect is brilliant. He really is a patient man. My head is swimming with ideas on how we could use the extra space advantageously. In the meantime we have started rearranging things to make things better for all of us. Hubby has been dismantling furniture and shifting things around from room to room. There will definitely be one or two more trips to the tip before the end of the month. It’s all very exciting. This happy longarm quilter looks forward to all the great things ahead. New challenges are definitely afoot. So watch this space for news as the adventure unfolds. You might learn how not to do things! It will probably be a case of do as I say not as I do.

Jess is an average teenager whose life is changed by a seemingly random event. She meets Jack. She attempts to cast aside her domestic troubles – a non-existent dad and a drunken lacklustre mum - by following her ambition of becoming a singer, so when Jack appears with his proposition she throws herself into a whirlwind; created by a slightly open door. So having joined a band and found a loving relationship, Jess appears to have luck on her side. But as is shown in Jack’s game luck can depend on the toss of a coin where infinite possibilities become when it lands heads or tails. So when vengeful girls and twists of fate arrive, on which side will Jess’ and Jack’s story land? At the end of the novel you flip the coin and decide.
Native to most of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, asparagus has been cultivated since ancient times, and a recipe for preparing the vegetable even exists in the earliest surviving cookbook from the 3rd century AD. Picked before the shoots ripen (they get harder and less edible when ripe), asparagus can be eaten as the white or green varieties (white asparagus, which is milder in flavor, has been grown without much exposure to the sun) and cooked fresh or pickled to stay for months. They’re a very healthy vegetable, providing tons of fiber, potassium, and vitamin C, and is used as a diuretic. An early bird in the vegetable family, the harvesting season for asparagus starts in late April and runs through June–meaning that May is the perfect time to get fresh, delicious asparagus straight from the farmer’s market. Slap on a little hollandaise sauce and those shoots are ready to go!
I am proud to announce that after 2 months of searching for our new Executive Chef to oversee the kitchen, the New Albany Exchange pub + kitchen is proud to announce that Rick Adams has joined the team. I couldn't be more pleased with the decision and am looking forward to our new Summer menu rolling out in May that will showcase our kitchen's talent.
Her husband calls and requests to speak with me. I talk to him later and he wants to know why I let her go if I knew she was faking. I laugh and say it was policy and she requested to leave. He asked if there was anything else I can do. I say yeah, I rearrest her tomorrow and all her time starts over. He slams down the phone. I laugh and go on with the rest of my day with a huge smile.

White nationalism doesn’t address why all of these alien tribes have popped up in our midst. WNs like to blame these and other problems on the Jews, and while I acknowledge that they’ve had a disproportionate, malign influence, the fact of the matter is that the ideology that wrecked the West, liberalism, originates from whites. (Note: for the purposes of this essay only, I will regard Jews as a separate entity from whites.) The intellectual forbears of modern liberalism and its offshoot ideologies like multiculturalism and feminism were all gentiles – 17th and 18th century thinkers like John Locke, Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Adam Smith. The Jewish establishment in the modern West is merely a vector for a white-created disease of the mind.
Seldom a play has inspired so much music. Fauré’s suite and Debussy’s opera are best known but also Schönberg and Sibelius wrote music inspired by the play.
One Sunday recently, I found myself part of an interesting lunch-time conversation. We had just consumed the most amazing meal, which our friend, a mother of five young children, had somehow managed to serve us, despite having been at church most of the morning. In complimenting her on her fantastic effort, we mentioned how she is following in the footsteps of her mother, also a wonderful cook.

It's after 10 p.m. and I am just finishing up my weekend chores. Somehow I have ended up more tired than I was on Friday at 5, and that's saying a lot.

The next day I think I stayed in my pjs till around 2, till i got up the nerve to take Tex out for his needed walk. It was so helpful to talk with both my sisters, although when the second I hear their voices I break down in tears, they know what to say to build me back up. Thank goodness for them! I love them so much, and I love how well they know me, and know that I need them!
This past Saturday we had our maternity photos taken by my sister. She's a photo journalism major and unfortunately hasn't been able to use any of her photography skills since graduation way back in 2004 or 2005 because of different jobs and what not so it was awesome to have her take these for my family.
What I love about this novel, is the way Miéville almost seems to poke fun at the stereotypical fantasy ‘quest’ stories, like Tolkien for example, who he has often slated quite openly in the past. Zanna is the chosen one, the one who has been prophesised to save Un Lun Dun from the Smog, but this novel doesn’t quite go in the direction you expect it to. The focus ends up on Deeba, the un-chosen one. Deeba may not be in the infamous book of prophecies, she may not be the one the people of Un Lun Dun have been waiting for, but she certainly makes a spectacular heroine and one I came to love like my own friend. She’s your average teenager who isn’t out looking for fame or fortune, she just wants to protect not only her friends and family, but the people of Un Lun Dun who she has come to care about more than she ever thought possible.

Carrots are an excellent source of vitamin A, which promotes a healthy scalp along with good vision. Since a healthy scalp is essential for a shiny, well-conditioned head of hair, you’d be wise to include carrots in your diet as snacks or toppings on your salad.
So, my short update turned into a short novel.... thanks for staying up with me.

Hopefully over the next two weeks there will be some homogenization between these two extremes. I will argue the idea that Christians must recognize that politics has great influence over justice, prosperity and peace. Today it’s about justice.
Let us be clear, the AWL are right to say that the atrocities committed by the rebels, can in no way be used, as they correctly say some on the Left are doing, to lessen the vileness of Gaddafi's regime. This is not an ugly contest. Sacha Ismail writes, however,
The Sinners’ Bible was printed in 1631 with a lack of proof reading. The word “not” was missed out of one of the Ten Commandments, hence the instruction “Thou shalt commit adultery!”
It’s not quite “Zen” gardening because even that feels like it requires more maintenance than Stein’s garden probably needs today. But it is certainly more relaxed in its upkeep (though not in its establishment) than what my house is currently surrounded in and I am truly inspired. Unfortunately, as renters, we can only do so much; no prairie grass will grace our front lawn...but then, that wouldn’t have been what graced this valley when it was inhabited by Ohlones who embraced it’s natural resources. I can say that the snails will live in the succulents so that the birds can have something to feast on and their shells will disintegrate to enrich the soil with minerals. I also have a new respect for our compost heap.

The new owners divided the irrigated sections of the farm into 10 ha plots. Today nothing is happening on that farm. There was no business plan. Various organizations tried to help. The surrounding farmers and Mr. Oosthuizen himself wanted the new owners to succeed.
Most countries had already broadcast the previews and started speculations about who might be the winner, and then everyone just had to cancel their tickets and sit back to wait for a new date.
As much as I would love to be able to go to an antique store and buy a crystal chandelier, that just isn't in the cards for us right now so I was thrilled when I found this one for $50 (!!!) at Home Depot online.
I actually curved each of the Beans so they were a bit more rounded on the sides and not just straight. I added lots of dimensionals on this card under the Beans, the circle layers and the tags.
So, since we've gotten this out of the way ;D here is what I have come up with for today's Hop. I chose a stamp from the "Paw Prints" set which you can see could absolutely also be used for a regular sympathy card check it out
Pint-sized though she may be, make no mistake about it: this Southern girl has a voice bigger and better than most of her contemporaries that currently dominate the American airwaves right now. Golden and pure, her vocals are further complimented by a country twinge that stems from her heritage, which gives her a versatile edge over many pop divas. From the spunky punk-pop acoustic stomp of ‘We’re The Sh!t’ to her heartfelt & tender rendition of Adele’s global mega-hit ‘Someone Like You’, this little lady should have the masses eating out of the palm of her hand. The cherry on top of this singing sweetheart’s persona is the girl’s absolutely amazing personality: you only have to take a look at Cady‘s Twitter feed, or at some of the side-splitting gag videos she puts up on her YouTube channel (I personally recommend ‘Sh!t Cady Says’) to get a glimpse at how charming, witty and carefree this talented songstress is.
The videos below are from Cape Town 2010: The Third Lausanne Congress on World Evangelization. One of the major focuses during this past conference was marketplace ministry. This very encouraging because that was not the case just a few years ago. Enjoy!
They then reached the island of Diomedes. Santos led the stallions out to lure the mares. Harvi waited for him at the fortress. But hours passed by and there was no sign of Santos. Harvi wondered what had happened to him. So he decided to go himself and investigate.
So over drinks and steaks at Fallen Angel we asked them. Here’s what we found out:
Today I'm glad I resisted the traditional market pressure to either: (a) dole out cultural nuggets that did not serve the story strictly for educational consumption or (b) streamline cultural references so as not to challenge/stretch some non-Indians. That's where we still need to go with Native youth fiction--with "multicultural" fiction in general.
The sentiment was stamped on the chicken wire framed image (which this country girl totally can relate too - we just got new chicks 3 weeks ago!) and then added the smaller line image flower. I used a dye ink and watercolored the flower to give it a watercolor wash look, a nice contrast to the bold large stamped flowers.

Excuse me whats so snobby about a crappy degree? Living standards have improved that much that degrees are common even in the 3rd world, though college quality could be questionable and institutions are mere profiteering franchises (i.e. don;’t bother to get into debt here, open your own business instead of enriching the educational and education financing cartel AND avoid being at the mercy of obviously globalist/corporatocrat/plutocrat owned businesses for your living – buy some land and go subsistence if notm ANYTHING to not give a single manhour of work or cent to the hegemonists in society – not all are, but too many -especially the( GLC government linked companies and supplier crony/cartels).
The ovaries produce and release usually one egg each month during the menstrual cycle. Along with the adrenal gland, the ovaries also produce the female hormones estrogen and progesterone, which regulate and maintain the secondary female sexual characteristics.

I have to admit.Sometimes love comes out of nowhere, other times it’s a gift from God “just because.” We can’t know what’s around each corner but if we greet love positively,we thrive.The love inside may be struggling in ways we can’t know and not all gifts come with motives.

And Friday, there will come a day unlike any other. A day when Marvel’s mightiest heroes will all converge upon one single epic motion picture. A day that fans have waited a veritable lifetime for. And this Friday, it all happens for the first time at the first possible time.
Other brands have started to jump on this bandwagon too! Moi Meme Moitie recently released Sleeping Garden, which features an all-over print of a photo of a graveyard. Not exactly the same thing as classical art, but it's hard to deny the similarity.
But, in London, we are beginning to see the re-appearance of Spanish waiters.
I drove to Durley with the window down and my radio tuned to BBC Radio Five Live. Manchester United were making hard work of a visit to Upton Park. Graham Taylor, who earns his living as a pundit these days, couldn't see any way back for them at two-nil down. "They don't have any leaders on the field," he said, seemingly oblivious to both West Ham's indifferent season and the possibility of the four goals Manchester United would go on to score.
The kids, for the most part, are great. I pretty much let them do what they want as long as they aren't too loud, and operate under the basic principles that when you grow up it is socially unacceptable to be muddy so have fun now kiddos! I find that I'm not here to be a parent, but more of a mentor giving out some good, general information about life they might not get from their parents or school teachers. However, that does not mean that I'm any good at it. Enter Maxim, age 12:

5) Keep up with my blog.
When I finished high school in 2001, I was offered several scholarships to Otterbein College, where I'd be in a top-notch Theater program. All the scholarships put together paid for tuition and housing, so off I went with a beard I'd recently taken to wearing long and uncut and long hair to match. I brought my little brother and sister up to see campus when I moved in: a friend later told me that when he saw me for the first time, I was holding my six-year-old sister by the hand, pointing up toward what was actually my dorm room but he mistook for the heavens. Jesus is here, he thought. I am seeing a vision of Jesus on our campus.

When the Germans defeated France in 1940, Frances' new leader Marshall Petain and his fascist deputy Pierre Laval were quick to make a deal with Hitler, with the northern part of France under active Nazi occupation and the southern two thirds and France's colonial empire ruled by the French under the puppet Vichy regime.
The Android App Player is another example of RIM’s strength in innovation. In addition to Bridge, the Android runtime environment is one of the PlayBook’s best strengths to differentiate it from other tablets. An update coming (rumoured to be early summer) will allow multiple Android apps to run at the same time – harnessing the power of the QNX operating system to allow multiple instances of the runtime environment at the same time. If executed correctly, it means that Android apps would behave seamlessly with the BlackBerry apps that are running, creating an even greater user experience.

I believe this idea of being able to re-program the brain keeps the responsibility of recovery on the addicts, while also giving them active hope. Addiction as an incurable disease is a depressing premise. Addiction as a reversible set of programming is an open invitation to a new way of living. And it doesn't make me roll my eyes when I hear it the way I do when someone tells me "alcoholism is a disease just like cancer is a disease." Is that so? Then how come I don't see cancer patients driving their cars into telephone poles after they take their medicine?
My best friend and I have known each other since we were 12. We went to a predominantly black high school, and then a predominantly white college. The difference in the color of our skin never really mattered to me until college… not because I was now the minority… but because of the way guys approached us. I’m cute, but the guys always flocked to her first. Was it me? I asked a mutual friend of ours if I was being too sensitive. His response? “They assume she’s going to be easy, and you will require work. Of course they are going to go the easy route”. I felt guilty that this made me feel better, because I don’t think she’s easy.. & men should not assume that based on the color of her skin.
Some people wonder if Europe shuts down when the games are on. And I'd have to say, "Not really". For one thing, the games don't start until 3PM. No good European works much past that anyway. The restaurants and pubs without TV's sure looked empty. Another thing, many European women, especially in Amsterdam, seem to have a loathing for the game.

Alex, our heroine is broken from the onset. Diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor and battling the pain of the recent loss of her parents, she treks into the wilderness in what is a sort of abstract defining herself period. Intent on being alone she is slightly irritated when an older man and his very surly young granddaughter ask to join her camp. They have barely finished breakfast when something disastrous happens. Screaming pain, odd animal behavior and Alex's world is suddenly much more complex than only five minutes earlier. Alex and the young girl, Ellie, must make their way out of the wilderness to what they believe is the safety of civilization. Yet, as they trek further towards what they believe to be safe territory a reality starts to unveil before them…and it is not comforting.
It took quite a while to get the walls painted. It was a very hot summer here in Ontario so spending it indoors and doing reno work was not ideal. So it got put off a lot. But as of just the other weekend I finally finished 3/4's of the whole project.

And what a spread it was too! You can read all about it (and drool away) on Kathryn's blog here, and view some gorgeous photos here. In this post I want to concentrate on this absolutely delicious wild salmon tartare. Kathryn and I tested this dish out the day before, which is why I actually have some photographs that are styled, rather than taken on the fly, like most of our pictures are.
“free.” That isn’t going to impress a blogger any more than it would impress the staff of the New Yorker. Most successful blogs have a very specific style and audience and not everybody is going to be a good fit. Most author blogs are not monetized, so we’re ALL working for free.
Panasonics convention, recently held in Munich, was the venue where they revealed their DMP-BDT300, its first three dimension Blu-ray disk player. The recent moves they’ve made has shown they’re really keen to steer consumers into the three dimension revolution, and needs to have the ability to offer end-to-end functions for shooting films in three dimension, record them on to 3D Blu-ray, and then display them on enormous 3D enabled TV systems.
I have been trying to contact Amanda, Jacob's birth sister since he was 5 years old. Well very recently I found her. She didn't know about Jacob until recently either. She told me then that she had two brothers that had been placed for adoption. While she is still trying to adjust to the situation and isn't ready to meet Jacob just yet, she told me about Kyle. So I took a chance and contacted him. He was excited to have a little brother and wanted to meet Jacob. We planned a meeting for Friday. But he and Jacob were so excited we decided to meet on Thursday :) I took Jacob and we picked Kyle up from school. We got there and got out of the van to see if we could find him. I spotted him on the hill and pointed him out to Jake. They both went running towards each other when they met they shook hands. I could tell Jacob wanted to hug him but was a little unsure if he should.

In Arena's case, his claims about the test's inaccuracy are bolstered by the recantation of both alleged victims, who say they were encouraged to lie by their mother who was going through a bitter divorce. Writes Lindell:
As I sit here and type this another mother is having to prepare to say goodbye to her precious child. This child is fighting to stay alive to live with his parents for another moment. Sadly, this child was given a short life expectancy. Born only three days ago, this child may soon have to return home to the Lord. It breaks my heart to know that this family will suffer another loss of a child. Yes, another as they already lost one.
Another random bit of family history came to me this week from my dad's sister: "You may not know this bit of family trivia, but your great grandmother, when she came to America as John's wife, was unable to bring much with her. She did however bring a tea pot and teaspoons and some linen napkins. I'm sure she was horrified when she saw the Nebraska home where she was supposed to live and raise a family. Probably having things from England helped her to adjust."

2) Alright let’s pretend that thousands of American Whites haven’t been murdered in racially motivated attacks in America and let’s pretend that the Boers in South Africa are not on genocide watch because of their slaughter. Even if the only method of genocide being used was massive non-White immigration into ALL White countries and ONLY into White countries and forced integration and assimilation, this would still lead to the ELIMINATION of a unique human GENOtype, a GENOcide.

Three areas of strength in Litfin’s book are noteworthy. First, Litfin’s writing style is engaging. He makes ancient history accessible and compelling as he begins each chapter with a modern story that will help connect the reader with the church father’s life and work. His devotional style moves the reader toward worshiping God for what he has done in history more than the average biographical work. Each chapter includes reflection questions and a few resources to “dig deeper” into the particular father’s life. Litfin also provides a select portion of writing from each father to close the chapters.
Thanks so much for stopping by today, without you coming to visit my humble Blog I would probably not be stamping.

anyway, somehow i managed to make it to the teacher’s lounge in the sprachzentrum (about a fifteen minute walk from the train station), where i needed to make a photocopy, and then all the way back across the station to my class, getting completely wet along the way. and of course, once i got to my class, i remembered that one of my students wasn’t able to make it today and so, of course, i hadn’t even needed the photocopy in the first place.

The Jason Bourne-like, black ops thrill of this is clear: you parachute in behind enemy lines—or you smuggle, by way of some dusty, unpoliced airfield unmarked on official maps—a suitcase-sized portable internet. A kind of electromagnetic nervous system unfolds like living origami from your luggage, creating a "stealth wireless network" through which you and your fellow rebels can remain connected to data from the rest of the world.
By typing a hashtag (#) in front of a word or phrase, people can click on that word or phrase to follow a conversation about that topic, or see what others are saying about it. Good examples are the Tuesday evening #kidlitchat and Wednesday evening #YAlitchat. People interested in children’s and young adult literature discuss that night’s topic by adding #kidlitchat or #YAlitchat to their tweets. When you click on a hashtag like #kidlitchat, a page comes up showing all the tweets with that hashtag, whether you’re following the participants or not. Even if you can’t participate in real-time, you can bring it up later to read the conversation. Either click on the hashtag in someone’s tweet or type it in the search box at the top of the page.

An attic bedroom addition costing $50,148 was expected to recoup 72.5 percent of the cost nationally—inching up 0.3 percent from the 2010–11 report. The minor kitchen remodel also fared well, returning an estimated 72.1 percent of the nearly $20,000 job cost.
Plot is a series of scenes deliberately arranged by cause and effect to create dramatic action filled with conflict, tension, and suspense to further the character’s emotional development and create thematic significance. As she added to the definition, she explained the significance of each story element. I particularly loved that she included thematic significance as part of the plot. It is so often overlooked, or tacked on, but when done well it is the unifying force that weaves everything in the plot together. In effect, it is what makes a great novel great. The Plot Whisperer points out, "It is the main thrust of your presentation and what you hope to prove through your story. The theme is the why: what you want your audience to take away after having read your story."
So, it was raining at work today and as I watched the dreary drops drip their way down from the heavens, I thought to myself, can I write a poem about rain without using the words fall, falling, rain,water,drip, or drop.
Aging parents are, indeed, like children. Right now, my dad needs help moving from place to place, dealing with toileting and even feeding himself. The difference between caring for him and caring for my babies? Dad does care about who’s caring for him. He knows it’s tough and apologizes regularly. I sometimes wish he wouldn’t, but in the middle of a night where he’s gotten up three or four times convinced he needs to get ready for a meeting with an architect, it helps.
Last night, the club met for its February meeting that has been postponed from last week due to the weather. The off-schedule might have discouraged a few from making it out, and so a few regular members were not in attendance.
I may exaggerate a tad but I’m not gonna lie, nor will I be Pollyannaish about it. Generally, Nicaraguan cuisine has less gastrointestinal goodness than Iberian, Mexican, Peruvian, or Venezuelan fare. This shouldn’t be surprising as Nicaragua lies at a great economic disadvantage to almost all of its Latin counterparts. This country actually ranks as one of the top three poorest lands in the entire western hemisphere. This means that a huge chunk of the population lives hand to mouth and needs to focus on sustenance as opposed to fancy food.
Given the Monday post about goals (which got amazing feedback, thank you everyone!) I thought I'd share this story about a young lady going about achieving her goals...Last year I came across a book written by some school children in Timor Leste, I became curious and got in touch with the author for a copy. After a few emails back and forth, I learnt the story of an amazing young lady and the story of the book. I was so thankful when Katrina agreed to do a little interview! I'm so excited about sharing Katrina's story and the journey this little big book has been on!
There are some 1.3 billion people in the fobby motherland, broken down as such: around 1 billion what I call “Chinese monkeys” – basically really obedient workers who are super book smart and do exactly what you tell them because they don’t have the street smarts to do otherwise (and I’m Chinese so I can say it without being racist), 150 million well educated brainiacs working their way up the corporate ladders in the world, 100 million dumb shits who got lucky as hell with the economic reform and banked major cash and 50 million pure geniuses who will be the end of it all. Now I don’t say this lightly, I’m about as patriotic as they get these days and I do love my fobby motherland, but I’m not one of those ignorant patriots oblivious to our own faults and eventual downfalls.
We were very different, he liked me as a model, and then he invited me out for a lunch. we didn’t sleep together much, it wasn’t based on sex. He didn’t need that, Dunno’ why, in the beginning he liked to buy me clothes and all. He promised to be buying me a car and all that. That I’ll get an iPhone for my graduation and so on. Then it ended, I had enough of him because…
The first time I saw him, about seven or eight years ago, he was with a band called the Vigilantes of Love. But for the last few years he’s toured with his wife Mariah, putting together shoe-string-budget tours that snake all across the country.

My brother’s girlfriend, who had never had sushi before, decidedly approved. Once again, Lily raved, “You can’t taste the mushroom!” Wrong. So wrong. But I’ll take it anyway, since I know that means she likes it. My brother didn’t say much about the dish, he mainly just ate and ate and ate…So that’s good. Mom also got her own special roll (sans the red pepper that makes her throat close up) and she was over the moon.

Between the advance copies sent out (and my thanks to Old NFO for graciously volunteering to be an advance reader--his feedback was invaluable and much of it incorporated into the first round of revisions), proof copies and discussions on a handful of gun-related discussion forums, word is beginning to get out. I've been approached with several radio interview requests, a couple of mid-sized newspaper interview requests and more opportunities. Some gun stores are requesting posters of the cover, and I've received over a hundred requests for signed 5x7s of the cover.
So, call me lazy as I share another bad photo and a great recipe. Lazy Lasagna is pure comfort food that feeds an army. The original recipe was published in the South Dakota Centennial Cookbook (1889-1989). I received this cookbook as a shower gift as a blushing bride and it was one of the first not-Hamburger Helper recipes that I tried as I taught myself to cook. It is good food that people love.

Hi Lovelies, today is not a good day :( The neigbours Mother appears to be away and her teenage son has taken it upon himself to invite over about 40 odd kids and have massive rowdy parties the last two nights - Monday and Tuesday wtf? Anyway Monday was bearable but lastnight was horrific I couldnt sleep all night and I was a complete mess this morning, I was not going to be any use to anyone at work so stayed home and tried to sleep some more and watched movies.....I rang the police 3 times but they never bothered to come over :( Luckily my landlord also owns next door so I rang him today and told him what was going on and he wasnt happy so Im hoping the Mum has talked to the son as there doesnt seem to be anyone home at the moment. Fingers crossed they stay away and I get a decent nights sleep and can get to work tomorrow!!

Years later this is what Hassan has to say on love:
For pest operate to be most efficient, make sure you recognize your home considered and employ as many inhibitive measures as possible. If there are cracks in the floor or gaps in the wall, make sure you seal them properly. Pests like to live there. Stock up on efficient pest killers such as weed killer and woodworm rehabilitation so you can operate infestation. Remember that many types of pests can lay eggs that will hatch to numerous critters, so you want to have these products at the ready.

In a way, I hope so. But a part of me is scared of what would transpire if we started talking again. Where would we go from there? I can’t be friends with someone I feel this way about…It’s not possible. Every moment I end up spending with her I would want to grab her hand, or give her a hug or kiss her. Lavish her with affection and treat her like a queen. I guess only time will tell what’s going to happen, as always. I hate you, time.

I am sorry I won’t have the bavarian cream recipe for you, here’s a link to the one I used from the Food Network, but it really is a bunch of steps with pretty precise timing so I didn’t have the hands to take pictures while I was doing it. I REALLY, STRONGLY advise you NOT to take the shortcut a lot of sites tell you to with cream cheese and pudding. Not only does it sound gross but the bavarian cream is so worth it when you make it from scratch and really just requires attention to detail and making sure you’re prepared with everything you need before you begin.

The fury over the picture raged until November, when the US presidential election took center stage. Some claimed it was a conspiracy, set up by NASA to gain more funding for their space programs. Others called it a fluke or a poor quality Photoshop job on a preexisting Martian photo. As the excitement was building for the final presidential show down, the photos remained in the back of people’s minds.

2. Staying steady... not getting too up or down. Getting lots of sleep helps with this. We joked today on the ride about the TdF riders getting 70 hrs of sleep per week...and yep, makes sense. If I feel rested I can better weather the stress and unexpected demands that I know are just a part of life. They are gonna happen. I also feel less hungry when I get lots of sleep.

No one knows, at least as of yet, what drove Jared Loughner to do this. This guy is mentally unstable and what drove him to commit this heinous act could have a variety of factors involved. He may very well have been influenced by the rhetoric and actions of Sarah Palin, or not. There's enough hateful rhetoric spewed by all politicians to go around, especially over the last decade. Political and Religious rhetoric have simply gotten out of hand, and we've allowed it to happen. Politicians know this type of campaigning works, and that's what is truly shameful about the election process in this country. People buy into the rhetoric.
Yes, I'm an unschooling dad and we're an unschooling family but I rarely write about that specifically here on my blog. Ronnie covers it so well, so thoroughly, on the ZP blog that I have very little to add. There's also the fact that I specifically try not to overthink unschooling because I tend to overthink everything in my life so pathetically that I want to allow unschooling to simply be. Nonetheless, Jon Gold, spousal unit of the Zenma, asked me to write an essay about unschooling for him.

Miss BeckySC had a giveaway on her blog not too long ago. She was going to give away a sweet needle book she had made and if we were interested, we should leave a comment. Well, I thought it was darling and left her a note that as cute as I thought it was, I thought my DF Sally would really appreciate it. Sally has been fighting breast cancer and has returned to work for a short time until her next surgery. I thought this would cheer her up. It did! Sally received it on a Saturday but waited till Monday to open it in my office so I could enjoy it with her. Becky had wrapped it beautifully and had included a note so Sal would know what was going on.
I understand as Christians, we no longer live under the law of Moses. Yet, the Old Testament prescribes stern warning regarding the foods we eat. Of course, there is the vision given to Peter regarding the sheet that came from heaven. God clearly said to him that everything that He had made was clean. Christians have taken this as a proclamation to allow us to eat those unclean foods. Never the less, there are reasons for God’s prohibition. The Lord’s reasons weren’t arbitrary or even legalistic. We are finding that these laws contain clear concerns for our health.

True to their word, The Specials will be back on the road in 2012. The band is scheduled to play 4 dates in Australia from April 3-7, 2012 and a show at the Live At The Marquee in Cork in Cork, Ireland on June 11, 2012. Fans of the band living in the U.S. are still keeping their fingers crossed that the band will finally return to play and rumors I've heard from sources inside the band suggest this is a distinct possibility! Stay tuned.

To me, what the song says is that we as Christians are called to love. If that means loving a baby that’s going to be here for 7 minutes or 70 years, it doesn’t make any difference, you just wrap your arms around them and pour yourself into them.
I write when I can. Often I’m inspired ZAP! A new idea! But it’s midnight and I have children who will get me up in a few hours so I make a note and I get to it later. Sometimes I have time and I don’t feel like looking at that little note so I read instead or go for a run or clean a bathroom. And sometimes I’m kicking around that notion I memorialized in my notebook and I find an hour here and there over the course of a week—little bits and pieces in fits and spurts and then: Woah. It all stalls and I think, I am no writer. I am a fake. This is all bullshit.
He’s not a character devoid of controversy – but I would expect that kind of thing to be RetConned out of any filmic incarnation. It’s okay for Tony Stark to have some alcohol intake problems if they serve the plot – but nobody really wants to see the next “Iron Man” play like an indirect sequel to “Leaving Las Vegas“, do they? And I kind of doubt that Marvel are going to spend any of those “Avengers” takings on shooting a film where the lead character beats up his significant heroine other.
Some time ago, I had a most enjoyable – but very bizarre – evening in Battersea with Johnny Biltong, Tonto Popadopolous and George. @Oedipus_Lex, a friend met through Twitter and, it is fair to say, a man who knows how to enjoy good red wine…and liberate it… joined us. It was one of those nights… in fact , almost an allnighter, where the conversation turned…. suddenly, to quantum physics and Black Holes – possibly because I had encouraged George to change the subject which he had been extemporising on, randomly, for some time.

To film at Staffs Trails I used a Sony Z1 and Libec tripod. During the filming the sun was setting, so i was constantly changing the F Stop on the camera by one adjustment as and when necessary. I am happy with the quality of the riding and footage that I did get, however carrying the Z1 and Tripod in a bag while riding to the location was a little tricky and cumbersome. However the the results from the shoot were good. I will have to play with the Cannon 550d to create slow motion of the riders going over the jumps and pulling various tricks.

Even further proof of their high intelligence is the fish which means that if a famine hit the earth and food didn't grow, they would seek food from the sea. The last symbol appears to be the Star of David which means they were evidently Hebrews.
The few decorations I've done are pretty lame though. Truthfully, I'm nervous to commit the time to doing something actually decent because what if I like it? What if I don't want to take it down? What if I worry about remembering to do it again next year and then I don't and then I realize I didn't and it triggers some massive anxiety attack? You see where I'm going with this.

She pulled the dress off the rack, I tried it on, decided immediately, then we went to have a delicious Thai lunch. (It's a pattern we've repeated over the years on other shopping expeditions.) The dress was perfect: subtle rainbow irridescent beadwork, elegant tapered sleeves, a multitude of cloth-covered buttons up the back. Plus the skirt spun beautifully! I felt a moment of pure silence in my soul as my new husband twirled me around on the lawn at the Henry Miller Library, the white satin flowing outward in a dramatic crescent, soft green grass whirling past.

This is known as a Correlative Association. Whilst the incidents of both events happening are mathematically related, in real life they actually don’t effect each other. If we were to stop selling Ice Cream on a hot day, we can assume that just as many people will drown (If not more because they need to find alternates to cool down than Ice Cream, so more people will be swimming). The same goes for if swimming was banned, we could assume that just as many if not more Ice Creams would be sold.

These type of people continue to teach me an important lesson, that I could not have learned from my mother. Although my mother taught me compassion, generosity, and a few other valuable traits, she had a terrible habit of being grouchy with her customers. She worked from home, and when it was her down time, she wanted to be left alone. The phone would ring and she'd haul herself away from Perry Mason, leaving a trail of expletives that would curl someone's hair. (Little joke-she was a hairdresser.) This was before the days of voice mail, so her ladies would get the terse, "Why are you calling me on my day

Although it is a standardized test, the test and the testing process is a good indicator of how well you will succeed in the law school of your choice. Do you have the motivation and patience to study for timed exams, for essay writing and for critical thinking? There are a number of options when it comes to studying for the LSAT. You can sign up for a review course, or you can study on your own with the help and resources of your public library. Although, to achieve the best score possible, it is recommended to study and learn from professionals who know the ins & outs of the exam.

Smart companies have addressed these problems by spinning off what are called "skunkworks". The original skunk works (note it's two words, not one) was an offshoot of Lockheed, and their most proud achievement (at least, that they could speak about) was the SR-71 Blackbird. A group of talented engineers went off in isolation from the rest of the company and created the fastest aircraft in the world, in record time, in the 1950s. Skunkworks as a single word is the term used for such a group set aside by any company for a similar purpose. This has been shown to be a successful technique, but note that the original company is still there, still working as an arthritic bureaucracy.

Companies cash in on these interactions, whether they be along the lines of the mistake to which I referred at the beginning of my post (following a pattern set by others), or the individual who stands out in a crowd and defies the "herd mentality" to which he or she is being subjected. Or if you like, it's the clash between T-mobile's carefully choreographed "flash mobs" (groups of people dancing in joyful mood in Liverpool Street Station, east London, for instance) or VO5 and its status quo-approved rebellious stance.

In sex work research, advocacy and intervention as in public health work we know that if we are not members of the population we are trying to help we cannot impose our models and assumptions on those who are. We need to work collaboratively with local organizations, we need to involve the population we are working with in developing strategies and frameworks. We know these things and yet they seem to have been neglected here. In this case there are local anti-FGM/C and local health care initiatives that can be supported. I hope that what comes of the new attention to this issue is not divisiveness but discussion. I hope this generates discussion about the best ways to support locally organized anti-FGM/C campaigns where they have started, the best way to provide reconstructive surgery to those who want it, and sex education and rehabilitation along with relationship and family support to those who have surgery, and the best ways to support each other in doing all of this important work.
The resolution to the story was, in my opinion, quite well done. The Doctor didn’t seem to so much as save River and Amy, he just managed to keep them alive long enough for the Angels to have sufficiently drained the power of the ship so that the artificial gravity would fail. Once it had, the gravity of the ship oriented itself to that of the planet, and the Angels fell into the crack. The crack seems to feed off time energy, and complicated space-time events would serve to close it. The Doctor qualifies as a complicated space-time event, but all the Angels did as well. Thus, the crack isn’t completely sealed. It is still out there, but the immediate danger has subsided.
Amit Bansal - The IT industry in India has undergone a major transformation over the last couple of decades. In the nineties, the processes were still very nascent. It took lot of time to create replicable processes and practices that could bring predictability in quality and timely delivery. In this period, the industry witnessed lot of innovation through best practices to deliver projects in a hybrid onsite and offshore delivery. The industry also matured to create specialized practices across different verticals and technology areas. However, the main advantage of the Indian IT industry was still the Dollar Rupee arbitrage. One could get the same work done in India at a fraction of the cost of the western world.

Jesus was constantly telling the religious teachers of the law that they were blinded, they had managed to strain out a gnat with all their legalism, while swallowing a camel (Matthew 23:24). In other words, they managed quite successfully to do good things and keep from doing bad things (gnat-sized issues in Jesus’ eyes), but they swallowed the camel. They invited sin into their hearts and it consumed and controlled them 100%. The worshiped themselves, when they should have been worshiping God. They trusted their own righteousness to get them into heaven, when they should have trusted Jesus. (No wonder Jesus was always getting upset with them and shouting,”Woe to you!”)

I was nervous to ask Angela to guest-post for my blog at first. Not only have I just 'met' her, but truth be told, Sweaty is not (yet) a household name. But I really felt that I had to ask her.

When she replied and said, "I'd love to guest post at your place," I was blown away by how nice and helpful she was!

If the technical aspects of the film are straight out of the top drawer, then the same can also be said for the acting. Burt Lancaster kicked off his career with some finely judged playing as the doomed Swede in The Killers, and Siodmak got him to tap into that same vibe to coax another wonderfully nuanced and sensitive performance from him. Once again he hits all the right notes as the big palooka whose dark romanticism sees him suckered by the machinations of a conniving woman. Every emotional state the script calls on him to display is carried off convincingly, from fear and disenchantment right through to the calm acceptance of his fate at the end – from the dumbfounded look of a guy who’s just had his guts kicked out by the woman he loves to the cloying sense of panic of a man under sentence of death and trapped in an anonymous hospital ward. Yvonne De Carlo didn’t have to go through quite as many stages, yet she’s still excellent alternating between the sassy, sensual broad that forms her public persona and the nervy, desperate woman she becomes in private. When she drops all pretense in the climax and reveals her true character to Steve and the audience there’s a tangible shock to be felt. Dan Duryea was an old hand at taking on the role of the slimy villain, and to that he adds a layer of menace as Slim Dundee. He manages this so well that it’s easy to understand the level of fear and trepidation he provokes in Steve when he contemplates the consequences of crossing him. While these three actors carry the movie, there’s real depth in the supporting cast too. Stephen McNally is solid and sympathetic as the cop whose friendship for Steve leads him to inadvertently push him into crime. In fact, there are lovely little cameos all through the movie: Percy Helton’s chipmunk featured barman, Joan Miller’s garrulous barfly, Griff Barnett’s kindly and lonely father figure.
The card was cut at around 6 inches as were the layers. I altered the layers by cutting the straps off the top of the suit and adding my own ribbon.
Of course, with many movies these days no originality is present whatsoever, right away it reminded me of Inside Man. The difference between the two movies is that Inside Man is creatively done and entertaining until the very end. As for Man On A Ledge, it’s very predictable and when it was trying to be funny, it was lame and when it was trying to be suspenseful it was funny. I’m not sure what the director was going for but in terms of quality, or the lack of, it was mediocre. The acting was typical and unmemorable, no character stood out. And as much as I like Sam Worthington, his accent was inconsistent through out the movie which weakens his performance.
He regretted that the police displayed “a general lack of cooperation” towards the Bar’s monitors and were at times even “hostile”
The louvers viewed from the long entrance approach, characteristic of the inverted L-shaped lot, welcome visitors and heighten their expectations for entering the house.

I’m not the first President to call for this idea that everybody has got to do their fair share. Some years ago, one of my predecessors traveled across the country pushing for the same concept… So this President gave another speech where he said it was “crazy” — that’s a quote — that certain tax loopholes make it possible for multimillionaires to pay nothing, while a bus driver was paying 10 percent of his salary. That wild-eyed, socialist, tax-hiking class warrior was Ronald Reagan.
My daughter is nearsighted and also has Convergence Insufficiency--something I've never heard of until now. It's apparently genetic and the opthalmologist believes that I also have it. Basically our eyes do not work well together and cause a host of problems such as blurred/double vision, headaches, faulty depth perception, etc. My daughter will be starting "vision therapy" for 30 minutes each day, 5 days each week. The program is computerized and a bit on the expensive side, but she should be able to stop doing it in about 90 days. She is very motivated and eager to start. We should have the program on the 8th of April when her opthalmologist returns. I am very excited to see how she progresses.

Paul takes this cultural artifact — an altar to an unknown God — and uses it as a springboard to preach the Gospel. He also quotes from one of the ancient poets, probably Epimenides, when he says, “In him we live and move and have our being.” (v28). Altars, poems — these are products of culture, yet Paul infuses them with Gospel meaning. This is Paul’s missionary strategy with these Gentiles: to meet them on their own terms, preaching Jesus as the power to infuse life with true meaning and purpose.
Hopefully this is the start of a little series I'd like to do, but I can be a bit flakey when it comes to committing to things in succession. It's only that I've felt myself getting a bit tired looking at street style blogs and catalogs for my inspiration, because often in the end I still feel a little bit of 'well, it's not quite as good as the original, I had to make do you see'. If I'm not dressing as a character in a book, I might as well dress like the book itself.
Erin wrote to me to share one of her posts, however, after checking out her blog, I decided we couldn't just stop at one! So she is sharing in the form of a compilation guest post if you will!

After He healed her, he told the family “Give her something to eat” - Feed your dream! Stand up! Keep your dream alive in you! Other people may even say its dead – look to Jesus, study the Word, practice hope …and be ready for total amazement.

Meantime, interdisciplinary researchers have not been idle. Given such a wealth of new information from astronomers, mythologists (following the trail begun by Hamlet’s Mill authors) have been working alongside scientists to make sense of thousands of years of transmitted lore, art, ancestral wisdom and belief which attest to hugely violent episodes in our planet’s past related to the heavens. Mythological and cultural archetypes worldwide share language, symbols and a timeframe which suggest a less-than-tranquil formative period in Earth’s evolution than the one traditionally held by astronomers.
Apparently, Supervisor Malia Cohen told the cash-poor women they had to "pay to play," and attorney Kat Anderson accused them of sabotaging the entire effort. Then somebody accused Anderson of "living in the Marina," which is a fact, but apparently a mean one.

I decided to try to catch up with my scrapooking by doing a layout a day (LOAD) this month. We'll see how far I get! Here's my first layout. I pre-designed it using Studio J, and then recreated it with the supplies I had on hand. The title treatment is an old Becky Higgins idea that I haven't used for years, so I thought it would be fun to try it out again. Hope you like it.
Good morning, dear readers! How is Tuesday treating you? As we all know, last month was crazy! Inspiring! Panic inducing! It was the A-Z Challenge. While I didn't post everyday (nor did I get around to half as many new blogs as I wanted) I DID finish my story. Now, I have a new toy to play with :D I knew it was going to be a longer piece when I started the challenge but I wanted to get it out there and see what kind of reaction it received. Judging by your comments, I *need* to write this story! So thank you all for your encouragement and for giving me back my passion for writing. Seriously. I was beginning to wonder if I should change my major to history...again.
I didn’t hold my breath a little and give another tool –
Update: In case it is not already clear, I should perhaps note that I am speaking of Jewish RELIGION. There is also of course a substantial claim that modern Jews are RACIALLY related to the ancient Hebrews.

It’s very difficult to pull off rock music in films, with almost all of them missing the mark because the music simply isn’t good enough. Rock films depend on the audience being carried away by the power of the music, which to my mind has only happened twice:

He highlights a connection between the French knight and the Crusaders who sacked Constantinople in 1204. “And we have a description of a cloth, that sounds very like the Shroud, that had been seen before that in Constantinople, described as the burial cloth of Jesus, that then goes missing and is never heard of again.” So, de Wesselow’s theory is that it was taken to France by the Crusaders as looted bounty.
Our two friends from London, and this is their progress of love, asked us to go with them the following Monday to the Office of the City Clerk in Manhattan and witness their wedding - which we did, in the lavender-decorated ceremony room. I'm pleased to say that neither the color scheme nor the continuing rain dampened their ardor.
When James Buchanan became president in March 1857, he was determined to assert federal control over Utah Territory, where most of the residents were Mormons. Buchanan dispatched a brigade of 2,500 infantry and artillery troops for Salt Lake City under the command of the infamous General William ("Squaw Killer") Harney, who had a reputation for harsh methods. The troops were to establish a federal garrison in Utah and provide support for the new non-Mormon Utah Governor Alfred Cummings, who had been appointed by Buchanan to replace Young.

Further along the concrete walkway, there was a building being turned into living spaces. These living spaces were small and did not feature a kitchen. Since I had this dream before, I recognized the man working on the interior of the building. Since I remembered having the dream before and it had been a pretty long time since I had this dream, I said to the bearded contractor “Still working on this?”
Enough of my friends have been fined over the years for me to consider it high-time to invoke counter measures, so last week, just as it was getting dark, I deliberately used the car park, walked round to the back door if my house, went upstairs, turned off the lights…and waited.

To his credit, Mr. Potok acknowledged that the question was an honest one: “I understand the criticism and it’s not an illegitimate criticism,” he said.
Asbestos dangers and action go aback a connected time, with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency banning the use of asbestos in 1989 afterwards free its baleful properties. It does not yield abundant acknowledgment to asbestos for potentially baleful altitude to develop, and by the time asbestos was assuredly banned, tens of bags of workers had already been apparent to it for decades.
“The object is to save jobs. The running of a newspaper, or any other enterprise, along commercial lines, requires that commercial considerations come first. Workers ' management sounds attractive, but that management would face the same problems as the Beaverbrook management.
At Balfour House, the man in the beaver hat, lantern in hand, climbs the stairs to the secret room where the bat-woman hovers near the ceiling. Come down, he says, all is ready; she is on her way.
The manager went on to tell a local TV reporter that the vice president went up to him later and whispered that he was just joking. The manager also said, however, it didn’t appear to him that Biden appreciated the comment.
“And don’t worry about losing. If it is right, it happens—The main thing is not to hurry. Nothing good gets away.”
BTW my Process Plan: the order of events in terms of writing this is that after the synopsis is fleshed-out as best I can, I’m going to sit on it for a few weeks. It’s not going to be possible for me to forget as much as I probably should about this story–it’s been hanging out in the back of my head for far too long to do that–but the idea is that by letting it lie fallow you come back to it and see the gaps and problems better than you would if you had stayed down in it continuously. In truth I’d probably have to let it rest for six months to accomplish that. I don’t know if I’m going to do that yet or not. Probably not.
So after all that depressing life stuff which seems to be very relevant around here at the moment unfortunately, we have had a some nice news. My SIL who had the twins nearly a year and a half ago now is expecting another bundle of joy in September. We are all hoping she has a girl this time as there are only 2 girls in our family. I have been trying to decide what to knit up but havent really decided as yet what I will knit unless she tells us what she is having. I havent really been into knitting baby knits at the moment.

I used to have this fear of being seen as needlessly controversial. And it was for that exact reason I always felt like I had perfectly good excuses to open my mouth. Coach had a very big job: keep Jamie in line and properly discipline him if he isn’t. For me, Coach’s stamp of approval was equal to his clear disappointment whenever I would act out, mouth off or get tossed from a game. He had the same role as my father, acting as the catalyst for that stinging feeling in my stomach simply by tossing a look or saying my name in a certain way. Along with my father, who I haven’t spoken to in years, he was likely the second most influential male figure during my teenage years. I just didn’t know it til years later.
Yes, I have been told that by doing so I do encourage pan handling. I say however that it is between the person and his Maker. The person asking for alms or “anything that helps” must really be in need…for them to stand out in the cold and even under the rain!

That pretty much applies to everything in Life. It’s not in my time. It’s in His. Regardless of what Higher Power propels you through the Universe, you get those gut feelings from time to time that you are meant to barrel down a chosen path. You may not realize why – and you may never truly understand it – but you take off without regard to better judgment and find yourself landing in the midst of yet another of Life’s milestones.
In effect, this structure created an efficient privatized social welfare system, which would help advance the Irish immigrant poor up the economic and social ladder. It was strongest in an area like Hell’s kitchen where the population was predominantly Irish and German immigrants who were most in need of City and other services. The district leader in Hell’s Kitchen from 1870 until 1892 was the legendary George Washington Plunkitt, who was immortalized in the pamphlet “Plunkiit of Tammany Hall,” a series of solloquies on New York politics published in 1904 as told to a New York Post newspaperman William Riordan, and today are read in sophisticated college political sciences courses on urban politics. As Riordan observes, Plunkitt works as a district leader more than 12 hours day. Although he had business interests as a contractor and has became a wealthy man from these activities his primary role in life is to carry out the political and social operations of the democratic party, which included helping constituents who are in trouble, keeping his district organization together or organizing social events such as parties or trips for his constituents, which to the poor of Hell’s Kitchen was the social equivalent of Mrs. Astor’s ball for the 400 most socially prominent New Yorkers.

I pick on Barry a lot. I mean A LOT. I’m almost positive he knows that I’m kidding, but if he doesn’t – Barry, I’m totally kidding when I pick on your white space issues and tight pants. They aren’t too tight and I think it’s awesome that you want your pages to be perfect. He’s another person who is going places with his writing. This guy can pump out more 1,000+ word articles than you have ever seen, and the best part is that they aren’t crap. One day when him and Haley are all old and married I know we’ll still all be friends, and I will still be picking on him. He just makes it too damn easy.

It's been 8 months since my mom gave me the definite news that they needed to cancel our trip that was supposed to be November 2011. That day I stepped away from trip planning and haven't opened my computer file since. We decided to postpone the trip instead of cancel...for November 2012. My mom really wants to go when the parks are all decked out for Christmas. It's felt really weird to not be planning a trip....I'm almost always planning a Disney trip! The trip was 80% planned out and everything will pretty much stay the same. Normally I am always making some kind of Disney plans...so it's been a weird 8 months.
Mana: She caused the apocalypse or something, I dunno. Her evilness was hardly explained beyond ‘because she touched the first crystal’ and was on the whole completely inexplicable. Her link to Inori was never fucking explained, so I’ll assume it was an awfully convenient coincidence. Or maybe, like Gai, she was being raised to be Eve. Actually, that might be it. Either way, Mana. WHAT was the deal with all the incest/shotacon stuff? There was just no call for it, and all it did was creep me out.

It's not just about getting a tractor cake made, it's about the process." is me trying to say "I love you" in a different way, his way.
What’s the point of that little story you ask? What was the point of Monday’s post? Well, it’s time to go into why we had Monday’s post and today’s little story. Lets start off with Monday and how to start the week off right. This Monday, we spoke about how important it is to have a great start to the week and to be positive. Here’s example number of the post, Monday here was pretty amazing, everyone was really positive at the office and amazing things started to be put in play. Tuesday came along piggybacking of Monday and brought in some major key items, that lead to Wednesday, which is now a very important day this week for us. This all started because Monday, was kicked started with the positive energy of all the people in the office.

After you visit the spillway, head back up the dirt road (past the trailhead) until you reach the West House, the structure for which the trail is named. According to the Greensboro Park & Recreation site on the West House Trail, the house was built between 1815 and 1820. The website also mentions that the house has some decorative “Flemish Bond” brickwork, which is relatively rare in this region.

My experience in the Basic Program probably made me seem plausible as someone with whom the President of Rosary College could fill a sudden vacancy in her Political Science Department. It also probably made me seem plausible as someone who could serve, six times each semester over two years, as a commuting visiting professor in the Politics Department at the University of Dallas. The contacts developed in the Basic Program contributed as well to my professorship in Loyola’s School of Law.
So enjoy yourselves and the sunshine (if you have some). It's a bright and shiny day here in San Francisco.

My dad makes these amazing marinated portabella mushrooms on the grill in the summer time, and I was craving them the other day. I cut the stem off of three portabella mushrooms and put them in a plastic Ziplock bag with about a half of a cup of Italian salad dressing. I used Newman’s Own Light Italian, but you could use any sort of vinegar-based dressing (needs the acid for the marinade). Then I just stuck them in my refrigerator! I actually left them there for over three days…oops. Originally I was planning on just cooking them in a sauté pan like you would a hamburger patty, but by the time the weekend rolled around, I had some produce I needed to use up.
What followed was a kind of theme park whirl around musical genres - with the emphasis on early music - that was a bit Hammer Horror camp, a bit Robin of Sherwood and a bit Witches of Eastwick. But retro. Crucially, though, it also managed to pull off the clever trick of becoming its own genre by throwing in a slightly shy wink to soft porn in which every smiling glance between Baebes appeared to be a meaningful glance and every pipe placed between the lips was apparently laden with significance. Tonguing: oh yes. It was knowing entertainment, medieval stylee mediated by Cadfael, Ridley Scott and anyone who ever wrote a song, gave an interview or performed an entertainment about women labelled "witches" for being bewitching (although if witches really existed surely, as with criminals, surely only those bad at witchcraft would get caught?) It was none the worse for that, just derivative in a highly unusual and therefore enjoyable way.
I find His silence disturbing. Offense, injustice, lies…this scene has it all. Why are You so silent? Why do You not fight back? Why do You not lash out at the ones who are hurting You? Why are You so unlike me?
Carter: Because of his failure to lead and his failed economic policies of government spending and indecision, the "misery index" ¬- unemployment plus inflation ¬- crested at 20 percent, the highest number since WWII. Add double-digit interest rates into the mix and you have "stagflation." Stagflation is defined as a situation in which the inflation rate is high and the growth rate is low. The result was high prices, high unemployment, low confidence, and low growth.

The chart theory is working for us pretty well. He gets stars taken away for negative attitudes or whining. One day he ripped all of the bad and the good extra stars down. He didn’t perceive he also ripped the good ones down. Jeremy can earn Extra stars for having excellent behavior like the day he had such a great attitude one morning. I was so pleased and so proud of him that he got to go to After Care that day even though he didn’t have sufficient stars the day before. The extra stars can accumulate to 20 and then he gets to go to Toys R Us to buy a toy. So far, he has only a merge of extra stars for good behavior.. And believe me.. I’m looking!

"Wow! Really?", I thought to myself. I was in complete disbelief and in awe, as this happened. This was not because the guy sweared at me, but, because I didn't know the reason why he did it. He must have been a poor soul, who was probably pissed-off at his girlfriend, or at his professor.

We are made perfect through suffering not by possessing the greatest military on earth. Again if that were true as James Dobson implies that the more people you can kill with your army and weapons is a sign of God’s grace (favor), then all conquerors through the ages like Attila the Hun which was said of him, that the ground where his army of cutthroats thundered grass never grew again were favored men of God.

I hadn’t felt this type of fear ever in my past. A cold sweat formed on my brow as I walked across the street. Would I be able to make her cum? Would I be able to get hard enough? I didn’t have a problem with the Milf this afternoon, but a teen goddess sent shivers throughout me. I squeezed my cock for good measure and reassured myself that no one had eaten her succulent little pussy the way I was going to tonight. Oh, and her ass would be in for a surprise.

It is ok if you have to be active during the session. Many people have to work or take care of their families during this time. It can still be very beneficial if you aren't able to be quiet. It reduces the effects some but it can still be very effective. You can also sleep during the session. This is good way to receive the energy because you will be very relaxed.
Although I no longer work with Martin, I'm still in fairly regular contact with him, so I asked if he'd mind sharing his memories of the band around the time of my inaugural gig, which he kindly agreed to do – he also scanned a few of the photos taken at that King John School bash, shown at the top of this post - Martin is the one with the long hair (click on the photos to see a larger image).

The events of the previous 13 days changed the way of thinking for Julius. In Acts 27:16-17, they “had much work to come by the boat, which when they had taken up, they used helps.” At that stage it was of supreme importance to save that skiff, but now they cut it loose entrusting themselves to the sea and a severely damaged boat. They had a totally new perspective of the situation. They were now obeying what the Lord told them through Paul.
I think that the Socratic problem is the result of confusion. Whether we are speaking of Jesus, Buddha or Socrates, the result of “know thyself” doesn’t end in a muddle. Each of them spoke of a higher reality that could be reached, and as the journey unfolds, reason and unreason each play a part. Reason sorts out contradictions and analyzes what is happening as inner experience shifts. Its chief value is to pierce through self-delusion, just as Socrates did with his Socratic method. Unreason brings intuition and insight.

There was no fast food in the thirties, unless you counted an ice cream cone at the drug store. Your vegies were done from the plant. For green beans , we had to break the ends off and pull the strings down the side and discard. Then we snapped them into about 2” pieces. Potatoes had to be peeled and cut up. Pinto beans had to be washed and soaked over night. You get the picture? Cooking three meals a day was not easy, but we didn’t know anything different and did what we had to do.
When we were there last weekend, this tiny little memory that I hadn't thought of for years came rushing back. And Orrin was cranky and throwing a fit and I was so tired and I just couldn't shake the sadness.

There are several aspects to Israel's assault on a Gaza-bound flotilla with humanitarian aid yesterday that left about 10 civilians dead. The least important one is whether the attack was technically legal or not. It is unimportant for the same reason that it is irrelevant whether the Chinese repression on Tiananmen square in 1989 was done within or beyond the boundaries of the law. What is most relevant is, in both cases, that the tragedy was a corollary to a history of major human rights violations. Curtailment of freedoms and harsh repression of political dissent in one case; the inhumane, pointless and grotesque siege of a defensless people by a nuclear power in the other.

Gun obsession and violence in this country is out of control (well highlighted by Michael Moore’s film, Bowling for Columbine). People keep guns in their homes, their cars, the desks at work, behind the bar, behind the counter at work, on their person, and anywhere else you can think of. Why do we have all of these guns all around us? Are we in constant danger of being killed? Reality and statistics will tell us no; violent crime has actually been steadily declining in this country for the past 40 years.
I should qualify that my comparison of Holmes to a "pulp hero" is made in comparison to the staid 1922 film I mentioned. Though ADVENTURES does emphasize its violent elements in terms of a strong combat, it should be noted that the degree of violence never goes beyond its function in the plot. In contrast, the 2009 SHERLOCK HOLMES does emphasize violent combat in scenarios that add little or nothing to the plot as such, and so qualify as "spectacular violence."

Deja Vu is the intense, awesome experience of knowing exactly how a situation will play out because you’ve been there before. No, I don’t mean when a situation seems “familiar”, and I especially don’t mean when you point out something is happening over and over again. Fuck, that’s the opposite of deja vu. The few times I’ve been lucky enough to experience intense deja vu it felt as though I’d been transported into my own body in the past. I didn’t feel familiar with the situation I was in, I felt as though I could finish every sentence spoken. And the sense of time is amazing, you get a very distinct sensation of not living the same thing twice, but of being in a place you were before, some vague moment a week or a month or a year ago that has dragged you back into itself. In fact, the fullness of sensation experienced has caused quite a few researchers to recommend the term “deja vecu”, because “vu” means “see” but you do more than see. This is evidence that researchers enjoy being pedants when they’ve run out of useful things to do. The point is: I really cannot recommend intense bouts of deja vu enough, they’re lovely.

I find the best remedy for those mornings is to stop and take some time for myself. Even if it is just 15-30 minutes doing something I enjoy (like going for a walk or run); it seems to help get my mind off my mood and moving on to my day. But, sometimes I don’t have the luxury of even a 10 minute walk in the morning to clear my head. Those mornings, I try to at least make my breakfast something good for me but tasty and enjoyable too – something that makes me feel good and makes me smile. Many times a smoothie will do the trick. It’s a sweet treat that I feel good about starting my day with. And, they’re quick enough to allow me a few moments of reprise while sipping slowly to start my day.

And what sort of example does this set up for the rest of us? As far as I’m concerned, the truth is the truth. My ex used to say that there are three sides to every story; His, hers and the truth. Sorry sister, there’s only the truth. And it stands alone. One side, one story and one truth. The reason this is all so important to me is because there seem to be too many liars in the world trying to justify why they have to lie. As though messing up other people’s lives with their non-truths is justified because someone with more money (who has no idea they’re lying) endorses them.
I fed the cats, changed to go out and went out. I stopped at the bank to withdraw money. I drove toward Target. The sky, which delivered light rain this morning, now was the color of a bleached heron. An unbleached heron flew, flapping eastward, in the sky over Spring Ridge at 3:11.

I went to Lowe's to try and get some paint stir sticks for free (which I thought they might do, since I buy paint there about 3 times a week, and I rarely take stir sticks, but no. Major bummer. I ended up buying them online here), and also picked up some veneer edging for my brace on the inside as well. Here's what it looked like:
I was also pleased (although ‘pleased’ is probably not the right word) to see that this book is, as I suspected, a personal insight into the nature of betrayal but then I imagine there are few of us who have not let down someone in the past or been disappointed ourselves.

The Men of the North form the core of the Counterjihad. They are already in action, clearing the back alleys of Anbar Province, riding point in Kabul, and forming up in self-organized groups to defend our borders with Mexico.
"Clearly this is a case of homophobia and police brutality. It’s disgusting to think that in this day and age, homosexuals can be treated like this and the police get away with it," said Nitzan. "We don’t cause trouble, all we want is to have a good time and to be left alone."
In the Nordic countries, the main day to celebrate is the 24th. Traditions vary, but in my family it has always been like this in short terms; waking up early and open up your stocking and having breakfast together, go to grandma and drink mulled wine, watch Donald Duck (huuuuge Swedish tradition) at 3 pm, eat loads of food, get gifts from Santa and then eat sweets and then go home with the bus. This year, we've had to make our own traditions, which actually feels really good. Since it's only the two of us, it has been a bit limiting, but we've made the best out of it. I'll write a post about our 24th and 25th once they're over, but I thought I'd share some sweets with you today.

The real change has been in the quantity of music being supplied to the market. There is so much more music now. Where once the average person might have listened to ten hours of music ten times, they now listen to a hundred distinct hours. I think people are less inclined to listen repeatedly to music they don’t like. That’s a change. I hated that Gomez album that I had on tape in 1998 but I must have listened to it a whole bunch of times on account of not having that many tapes in the car. We’re probably free of that now.

Meanwhile, MillerCoors has opened a front in the Craft Beer Wars in Wisconsin, home to my beloved New Glarus. Their corporate legislators have introduced a bill that would remove the option of a brewer to choose to self-distribute, require new distributors to have 25 accounts before they can get a license, prohibit a brewery from owning two restaurants (think BJ's or Gordon Biersch), and would prohibit a distributor from investing in a Wisconsin brewery but allow investment in an out-of-state or foreign brewery.

In 1860, before the start of the Civil War, Mary E. Carroll and her husband William Washington Knight were living in the vicinity of Beaver Dam Creek near the present site of Ray City, GA. William owned a farm there, situated next to the farm of his uncle, John Knight. William’s real estate was valued at $1100, and he had a personal estate of $700. William and Mary were raising their young children, Mary V. Knight (4), Margaret A. Knight(2) and Walter H. knight (6 months).

Secondly, the writers are simply abandoning storylines and picking them up again when necessary. Examples? Jung Ah. Michael. The Loanshark Tae San. Even that ‘what’s his name’ friend. Isn’t that what you’d call loose ends? YGM was supposed to be a brand made for Tae San, at his investment. Fine, he withdrew it later at Jae Hyuk’s pressure but that’s it?! What about Michael? He made the deal with Young Gul seeing Young Gul’s talent, right? So how can they just change hands on YGM without a fuss? Fine, you wanna move Young Gul from the equation-do so by all means but at least involve the parties in it! Make it seem legit and believable! We get a contract signed by Michael for a brand which he endorsed because of a specific person and now that specific person has been removed from the equation but all’s still well in the world? Really, writers?

The IPKat likes patents for perpetual motion machines (though, embarassingly, he couldn't find a link to this one). They shouldn't need to be expensive to examine once you rumble the concept, so the patent office should get good income from them. The inventor is happy because he's got his patent. The patent agent is happy because he gets his fees. Other manufacturers sleep soundly because, if the invention is contrary to the laws of nature, there's not much risk of infringing it. Merpel adds, there's not much sympathy for investors. They're prepared to sink a lot of money each year into patents that don't work even if they're not contrary to the laws of nature; if they don't do their due diligence, it's their own fault.

They only make it as far as the next interesting place, Scotland, and find themselves in the throws of a castle, because, well, something happened, but there they were. The hunched back man who answered the door, eerily followed the three around the castle. Door after door was opened, with the hopes of finding Larry’s father, but all that lay behind each one was a new mystery to solve. Behind one, for example, was Central Earth which consisted of the children of Men, Elves, and Gnomes that haunted the gardens of Men. There Larry, his red-headed girl, named, um, Matilda, and Juan, connected with Leroy, son of the Dave, son of the Harold, who produced DNA papers stating that he was indeed the father of Larry, and also a prince.

Donnie McDougall would go on to join The Guess Who in 1972 and recorded several albums with them. He wound up a truck driver living in White Rock, BC. In the mid-90's he would revive his career as member of The Best Of The Guess Who -- a touring tribute to his former band and eventually joined the reformed Guess Who in 2000; Caldwell left the music business; Roger Law died in a car accident; Faulkner joined the Wild Root Orchestra before leaving music to become a handyman only to return in recent years with the Kelowna, BC band Dog Skin Suit.
The vitriol and hatred flying from the "non-parents" at the "parents" was insane. I might say from the dog-owning to the child-owning, but that's really not what the tenor of the comments were. The tenor seemed to be that children should, as Mark Twain said, be put in a barrel and fed through a bung-hole until 18. I am more used to seeing this type of open and semantically veiled hatred from misogynists and racists but clearly I haven't been reading enough.
It was mayhem. The clouds continued to roar intermittently, lighting up the lawn and returning it to pitch darkness again. And in those brief moments, the tigers could be seen, each time at different spots, walking among the people. Children and women shrieked, men yelled, many scampered in the dark. Within minutes, the big cats disappeared in the forest. Nobody suffered a scratch. One forest official broke a leg running for his life.
President Obama clearly doesn’t get it. With a depressed, deer-in-the-headlights attitude, he argued that the problem was really the economy he inherited — we were voting against Bush? — and we are really angry that his agenda just isn’t progressing fast enough.

If you are hard of hearing, you might find this especially beneficial.
“It’s interesting because we went through a period where there were negative portrayals that were obviously covered in The Slanted Screen and then we went through a period where there were like no images,” said Adachi. “It was like there was a reluctance to include Asian Americans out of fear of criticism then you have the other extreme which is what you sort of see now, which is the combination of reality TV figures.”
You see, one of the perks of being a task-oriented person is being able to say "check' when a task is complete. You begin with a long list and feel daunted, even though you know you can handle it all, and then one by one, you check each task off the list until the page, or in this case a virtual sticky note, is blank. Satisfaction. Job well done. Check.
Whether you are happily single or a mother of four, having a room that pleases you is what we all long for. After all, what woman doesn’t want a modern, romantic, feminine, grown-up space that she can call her own—where she can listen to music and engross herself in the pages of Jane Austen?

We suffer and then we die. So I follow a vegan diet to perform at my highest level at all times. I want to be able to move, play sports, and take care of myself. I am a man on a mission. I show people that you can still build muscles on a vegan diet. You can still stay strong and you can become healthier. It is one thing looking good from the outside and being unhealthy on the inside. That doesn't work for me. I don't want that. I want to be both healthy on the inside and on the outside.

Thus began an ongoing discussion of marriage, personal freedom and relationship building. Looking back, I think I may have been the experimental vessel into which Leah tossed the various components of her quest for a happy and balanced marriage and professional life, a quest I gradually began to share. My home and marriage became a sort of living laboratory as Leah and I discussed our dreams of the perfect marriage and I began to stretch my requests for both assistance and acceptance from my husband, what Leah would call “raising” him.
I understand why people would think this is a chauvinistic hate-song to some punk-ass bitch. It really isn’t. What it really is about is how big an asshole you can be to one another in a relationship. I’m a dogg and she’s a bitch. We are equally good/bad to one another. But of course I’ll blame it on her when we’re having a fight, just like she would blame it on me, if it was her who’d written the song. In other words, I’m just saying it like it is. Nobody calls each other honey or sweetie pie in the middle of a fight, right?

Today we had our first 2 sessions of therapy with Marcy Lindheimer. Marcy was very pleased with the progress Bella has made over the last 4 months since she saw her in September and commented on how much more aware and available she is. I think because I see Bella every day I don't notice the changes as much unless I stop to think about them. We are working on teaching Bella to stand up by herself. She has already been pulling herself to standing against people and couches but we will work on her implementation and confidence with this. It is really good to be back in New York and getting another perspective on Bella and how to enhance her development.

One great difference was that this crowd was obeying man while Ananias was obeying God. They were responding in such a way because, according to Acts 21:27, “the Jews which were of Asia…stirred up all the people.” On the other hand we read in Acts 4:19,

There is an alternative to get people “working” again that addresses the spiritual and economic needs of people. It’s called S.E.E.D.S. for HOPE which provides biblically-based entrepreneurship training. More money, time, and energy needs to be invested into helping people build small and micro-businesses through entrepreneurship training, but it must be done in a way that honors God and not the “almighty” dollar. I believe innovative ideas, new markets, and financial opportunities will open up for Christian entrepreneurs when we reposition God on the throne of our lives and businesses.
I attribute my anxiety to family history, and also George W. Bush, the War on Terror, Columbine, the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, Virginia Tech, Katrina, and BP. To the disembodied leg that washed ashore last week in the Gulf Coast, white, clean-shaven, and bent at the knee. To the Nostradamas, Herald Camping, the Mayan calendar, and the film Armageddon. These things taught me that there is something coming after me – Death – and the only way to keep it away is to not let it in. That if I slip up, it’s my own fault. I boarded the doomed flight, I forgot to lock the car, or turn off the stove, or check behind the shower curtain before brushing my teeth. This is America, where we take responsibility for our future. I am starting at a higher place than my parents did and may go further. I am enfranchised, comfortable if not affluent, well-educated, with dental insurance. If I fail it’s because I didn’t take the opportunities that were given. My mortality, along with my success, is up to me.
When I woke up in the morning today (the usual time as my body did’nt know it was on break) I felt fresh,alive and excited; something that was not happening for a very long time.I called up my boss and told him I am taking a day off because I am sick.( Sick of him and the work I didn’t add) and suddenly I was free.Free for a day.Excitement.Loads of it.There were so many things I wanted to do. I didn’t know where to start.I got up to get pen and paper to make a list of things I wanted to do but then stopped midway as realised I don’t want to be all organised and disciplined (at least today) .I want to be impulsive and fun.
But there have been some wonderful and ingenious responses. Tony Diaz, known on twitter as @librotraficante (www.librotraficante.com), put together a book caravan of the banned books, handed those books out to students and started four underground libraries. Gina Ruiz, a writer and the blogger of Banning History in Arizona (www.banninghistory.blogspot.com), promoted a YouTube “read-in” of the banned books. And almost all of the writers whose words have been excised have advocated for the ban to be overturned — in person at rallies, in print or online.

When we returned to Sears our work ethic changed, now that McDonald's was behind us. Our jobs included, getting forklift rides from Sears employees named Spanky and Dirtball, playing hide-and-seek in the warehouse, daring each other to see who could hold their tongue on 9-volt battery the longest, and spinning on my dad's office chair. At the end of the day, my dad would come and get us and we would act exhausted from the hard day at work. We would spend the car ride home talking with my dad about the days events and for a brief time we were one of his work buddies.

This is totally writing unrelated but I must tell you because it's making me smile. I am currently as I type in the middle of a text conversation with my ex boss who is complaining about the lack of talent (amongst other things) in my home town. I've not lived there for nearly 30 years so I don't think that I can be held responsible. But maybe I can because when I worked for him I was responsible for just about everything else. Good job he's a pal. He was the first person outside my very close family and a particular friend that I told when I had my first story published. However that is the only one I have ever told him about. However there's been no text for a few minutes so maybe he's finally found something worthy of his attention.
With the momentum that genetic research has been gaining over the last 20 years I wish to propose a new subject of research – to work on genetically engineering the human DNA to allow us to develop a thin layer of photosynthetic moss over our skin! It would be perfect - when ever you are feeling hungry you simply step outside into the sunlight for 15 minutes and your new mossy skin will generate enough glucose to keep you energised for hours. Although not all of your required recommended dietary intake will be satisfied by your new ability to feed off of the sun, I imagine that we could fine-tune it down to only one required meal per day. This would still allow for the daily family meal that us Westerners value so much.

On August 19th, 2003 I was about 35 weeks pregnant with my first baby. I was furiously cleaning an prepping a special dinner for Howard's family to celebrate his Mom's birthday that we were celebrating that night (though it was her true birthday the next day). Howard had gone into the bedroom to lie down for a bit before everyone got to our home and I went in to the bathroom to get dressed. That was when my water broke. I stood there stunned and unsure of what to do. I couldn't tell if I had lost bladder control or if the time had come. I was certain it couldn't be baby time as I was still supposed to have five weeks to prepare for Luke's arrival.

I had an interesting thought last night. At least, I think it’s interesting. But I guess I can’t say that what I think is interesting, because it may not be interesting. That was a horrible sentence. ANYWAYS so the thought I had was, why not get all the terrible things that will inevitably happen during the week done on Monday, which is the mother of bad days, so that the rest of the week goes smoothly? Well, the world seems to think that was an excellent idea. So I had a truly horrible, no good, very bad day. And that’s the truth. See, first thing every morning I check my Facebook. While this is a horrible habit, it helps me make sure that I’m caught up with what my friends are up to (were up to). So I log on, and the first thing I see is that my friend got contacted by some agent in LA to be in a TV show. I was like, whaaaaaaa? Don’t get me wrong, she’s amazing and I love her. She deserves it more than anyone. But I just… I just sometimes wonder why good things like that never happen to me, you know? I do all the work (clearly), yet never enjoy the fruits of my labor… anyways, this is my venting about jealousy. There.

The series of dashes on every second line add a stop-start breathless quality underscoring that meaning that you’re getting to, but not quite, without allowing the poem to become trite and allowing the reveal to come quietly in the last line.
There always seems to be some type of speed bump. This one could be something minor, could just mean that I am healthy so I need more medicine to control my cycle. Of course if you consult Dr. Google about this, it could also mean some scary things as well.
I kept telling my husband that it was ‘parenting boot camp’ since he does well with military metaphors. Luckily he got a break from the kids and was asked to chop firewood which he did, non-stop for 2 days. We also picked up trash, helped with baths, laundry, cleaning, dishes and damage control. Fifty is not a lot of skittles or slices of bread, but it is a heck of a lot of babies!
7. DESIGNATED DRIVER: Yes, we encourage this strongly. You never know when you might decide to run for president. And even the designated drivers on the crawl qualify for the prize. While pregnant wives are perfect for this role, it is known to be poor judgment for a husband to claim that this is the best part of her being pregnant. See "Mood Swings."
Me: Bronwen, that is so gross. If your friends find out that you pick your nose and eat the boogers, they won't want to play with you anymore. No one likes to be friends with someone who is disgusting!

I love Pinterest! I just can't keep that a secret. In my attempt to be a better blogger, I'm going to try at least one pin each week and write about it...otherwise, what good would those hours upon hours spent pinning be? ;)
I don’t actually remember taking this many pictures of tulips in the spring. My favorites usualy are the Peonies and the Roses, and don’t forget the Azealas.
The old cansin looked over his shoulder as he opened the door to the bedroom back at the tiefling as she slept soundly. He exited the room and made his way down the hallway back to the den where he went through the desk and found an old book which he blew the dust off of. He then settled down in the chair and opened it up, “There has to be something here about that blasted group below Cauldron…” he mutters and began to read.

With the “quick look” feature on the mac (press the space bar on a file instead of double-clicking it), I can quickly look through each test and see what question I used on it (arrow keys while in the “quick look” view will move between the files—no waiting for files to open, no mousing around). If I find a question I want, I can open just that old test and copy and paste it into my new one.

Planes, vans and a rickety "ferry" (another, even less sturdy, but mechanically sound long-tail) and we arrived at Si Phan Don. The road from the airport to the "ferry terminal" was paved but poorly macadamised, rolling with unintenional and ignored speed-bumps. The bridge aproaches were typical for the rural areas here - so sudden and steep and obviously made without the road's height in consideration - and the iPodded, sleeping E@L's head hit the ceiling each time. Melvyn Bragg, in midsentence. The driver had no concerns at this and did not slow except for cattle, broods of chickens (why DO they cross the road?) and dogs. Thirsty, E@L asks up front for water. D passes back a bottle upside down. E@L looks at it, tries to drink from the base, gestures to D for a meat cleaver. Hilarity ensues.
There are other places that really good for inspiration. I like going to poetry readings, they are perticully really good for creative flow. I like to hear the rythmn of someones voice. When people talk its soothing. my friend Andrew recites alot of poetry and stuff outloud and when he does that, its not that I am not listening its that the sound of his voice makes me write. It’s not just his voice, its anyones voice. It could be a song. I like jazz music personally. Nora Jones, Adele, some slow Carrie Underwood are my favorites the write to. When I am out and I write I need to have other sounds around me. I can’t just write in a silent room. In my writing class I had to do that. my productivness of that class wasn’t very well because I was writing in a silent class room. I think next semester I am going to ask if I could use my ipod while I write.

This volume also contains a sketch of Bontecou’s career, a history of the various images, and a brief summary of the last campaigns of the war. Each of the images identifies the soldier, what unit he belonged to, his wound, where received and date, treatment, and outcome. Some of the images have more information than others. The last few pages of the book list the battles, from the Wilderness to Appomattox, the soldiers in this book, their unit and plate number. Also included in this section are those with no battle listed and those who died of disease (not in battle). This book represents the earliest efforts of one physician to document war-related wounds and, by the use of photography,

This morning on the Interstate I looked over to my left and there was a woman in a brand new Cadillac doing 80 miles per hour, with her face up next to her rear view mirror putting on her eyeliner.

When I heard that the film was going to be remade for English-speaking markets I did not have high hopes as the original Swedish film, 2009′s The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo directed by Niels Arden Opley, is a very good film that does not really need to be remade. However, when I heard that you were directing and that Steven Zaillion was writing the screenplay I was greatly encouraged and thought you would be able to enhance the visuals, intensify the story, draw more out of the characters and electrify the dialogue. You did not achieve any of this.

I read solanin in one sitting. When I was done, I sat there, trying to sort out my reaction. The manga left me with a strange mix of feelings. First there was the good: solanin was a sort of revelation for me, that I was not the only one stuck in a rut, afraid to move, feeling slowly poisoned. I wasn’t the only one who couldn’t see herself as an adult, even though by all definitions I was. That horrible, disconnected, paralyzing feeling — I wasn’t alone in it.

Yet, we see people who have spent the best years of their lives inside in servile positions at OSA; some even invested their life savings in order to achieve the coveted state of “OT” yet they end up doing degrading activities “in the name of freedom”. These people have spent a fortune and a lot of time while all they can actually do is robotically follow evil destructive orders. I don’t see them having any OT abilities or acting as true OTs or with the above mentioned qualities.
From this end of life, it's possible that my mother was glad to get rid of me for a weekend camping trip, and didn't want her weekend spoiled. But, knowing my Mom like I do, it's more likely that she really didn't want to take something that was so very important to me away from me. (Especially not since my offense was...giggling.)

She's a gal that sort of drifted. Married herself a bean counter from the other side of the world and migrated to the land of kiwi for awhile. The scruffy faced husband and I had to learn the hard way that sometimes growing up means dealing with awful things. Like your parent dies. When you are 25 and your parent dies, you really don't know what to do with yourself. KT had to learn this lesson too. A gal I normally would associate with South Park episodes and spring break road trips handled her mother's illness with such grace and courage. She and her Kiwi husband moved back to the states to be with her mother in her final days. And then they moved to the mountains.

Began my sophmore year of high school- The school year began simple enough. The only class I was worried about was Earth Science. I had taken the lower level class because Chemistry was not something I enjoyed. I walked into the classroom and noticed two things. 1. I had no friends in that class. 2. It was a collection of the dumbest people I had grown up with throughout elementary and middle school. My only response to all this was NOPE. Promptly after class ended I went to the counselors office to change my schedule. In the end I got switched into Chemistry, and while I did have friends in the class and it wasn't full of idiots. I have never had a worse teacher in my life. It's the kind of teacher that makes you cringe when anything remotely related to the subject comes up outside of school. She made me hate Chemistry so much when I have a feeling I could have grown to love it.
In nonfiction, a chapter concludes more overtly. There's a hook to future material, certainly; otherwise, why would we read on? But nonfiction chapters deliver information and there's a sense at chapter's end that we've received enough to ponder and absorb. Nonfiction chapters often end with completion of thought, while fiction and memoir leave something deliberately unfinished.
So why did you use? I still wanted to try and understand what made him relapse.

Of all the hotel rooms rented by all the adulterous politicians in Chicago, female Assistant U.S. Attorney Cameron Lynde had to choose the one next to 1308, where some hot-and-heavy lovemaking ends with a death. And of all the FBI agents in Illinois, it had to be Special Agent Jack Pallas who gets assigned to this high-profile homicide. The same Jack Pallas who still blames Cameron for a botched crackdown three years ago- and for nearly ruining his career.

The events described in The Radleys take place over a long weekend with a postscript a few days after. The chapters are short, often no more than two or three pages, so it feels like you’re racing through it. It’s also hard not to read ‘just another chapter’ which turns out to be three of four chapters by the time you’re done. The book is 337 pages long but there’s a fair amount of white space.

An earthquake occurred about 125 km (75 miles) ENE of Iwaki, Honshu, Japan or about 130 km (80 miles) ESE of Sendai, Honshu, Japan or about 305 km (190 miles) NE of TOKYO, Japan at 8:39 PM MDT, Jul 18, 2008 (Jul 19 at 11:39 AM local time in Japan). The magnitude and location may be revised when additional data and further analysis results are available. No reports of damage or casualties have been received at this time; however, this earthquake may have caused damage due to its location and size.

See, Dustin is a frightened little child, trying to muster up the courage to walk up to the Cemetery to get his candy. But only we know that he will never do it. Because he's made from PVC. And he will stand at the bottom of the driveway the entire night. Frozen with terror, his only real purpose for the night will be to simply stand there and get in the way. And we'll watch all of the concerned parents and other trick-or-treaters awkwardly interact with (and walk around) him as they try to go up the driveway for their treats.

As a social worker, he'd absolutely have to. He dealt with kids all the time. That's why I know he'd be quite disturbed to read about how serious the problem of bullying in school has become. I believe he'd be in favor of a film that tried to document this situation using real case studies.

But, Marc says BrewDog was too late. It does sound odd that there was a dialogue all the way along the process which seems to have lapsed right at the point BrewDog were paying their final fees. Indeed, if what BrewDog says is correct, Camra might have pulled the plug ahead of the deadline.

A personal word to you younger men. I am finishing my 15th year at Bethlehem and I just celebrated my 49th birthday. I have watched my body and my soul with some care over these years and noticed some changes. They are partly owing to changing circumstances, but much is owning to a changing constitution. One, I cannot eat as much without gaining unhelpful weight. My body does not metabolize the same way it used to. Another is that I am emotionally less resilient when I lose sleep. There were early days when I would work without regard to sleep and feel energized and motivated. In the last seven or eight years my threshold for despondency is much lower.

This is my new Japanese maple, which was a birthday present from my friend Pat. I love it SO much I can hardly contain myself.

I hope I can get that fence up this year.

The X-Men came about at a time of inequality. First published in 1962 many saw their struggle as an allegory for the racial tension in the US. Today many social groups see similarities between their struggles and the X-Men. Part of it is simply the fact that they are a bunch of teenaged mutants that just want to live in peace and be accepted for who and what they are. Teenagers tend to respond to this message the most. Bryan Singer, who directed the first two X-Men movies, said “what teenager doesn’t feel like a mutant?”

I wish this was a joke, but no, –I actually did another 1000 Rep Challenge today. This is when working at a gym pays off. Thanks to my trainer friend Jonathan, I somehow squeezed out another 1000; officially placing me at an all-time record of 3k in 3 days. Honestly, if a fellow trainer hadn’t been pushing me, I wouldn’t have completed that second set of 180 Degree Plyometric Burpees. I certainly wouldn’t have added another riser to my jump stack. (When I saw Jonathan adding a fourth tier to my pile, kicking him in the shin became a pleasantly attractive option… I promise I resisted!)

But why pick on the lowly pubic hair? A few sociological theories suggest it has to do with cultural trends spawned by bikinis and thongs, certain hairless actors and actresses, a misguided attempt at hygiene or being more attractive to a partner. Surely human beings are not so naive as to be so susceptible to fashion trends and biases that they actually cause harm to themselves.

When we were alone, he told me it was ironic to him that all he wanted to do was be with me, be alone with me, be close to me, hold me–yet that was the one thing I didn’t want! Soon after that, he told me he didn’t think a divorce was necessary. I was dumbfounded.

Sprinkle both sides of chicken with garlic powder, salt, and pepper, going heavy with the garlic powder. Let sit for a few minutes. Then LIGHTLY coat in flour. (I pour flour on a plate and quickly "dip" both sides of chicken cutlets in the flour, shaking off excess.) Over medium heat, cover your pan with a couple swirls (about 2 tablespoons) of olive oil. Saute the onion and mushrooms until the onions are soft and the mushrooms are golden about 10-15 minutes, stirring now and then. Add the garlic and cook two more minutes. Empty the mushroom mixture on to a plate. Return pan to stove and add more olive oil. When hot, saute chicken 2-3 minutes per side until chicken in golden brown and cooked through. (You may need to cook chicken in batches depending on the size of your pan. I did!) Remove chicken to another plate. Add white wine, scraping up the brown bits of goodness and simmer for one minute. Stir in mushroom mixture, cream, and dill. Reduce heat and let simmer for 5 minutes. Pour over chicken cutlets.
The Progressive Exercise is a unique lesson in the Sensorial area of the Montessori classroom which heightens awareness of the child's sense of touch. This lessons aids the child's development of the haptic, or "blind man's" sense. The student is invited to feel with his fingertips one of four different objects in pairs and sort each one into sections of a tray or small dishes. Then, he closes his eyes or covers them with a blindfold and proceeds to feel the remaining items from the pairs, one at time. After one object is felt, the child compares it to the others and pairs the items by touch alone.

So, there you have it! Some of my favorite music from films over the past 10 or 12 years. Each of these songs have made themselves a presence in my life at one point or another for a variety of different reasons. Probably the most prominent were “Something To Die For” from “Scream 4,” “You Haven’t Seen The Last of Me” from “Burlesque,” “Cry” from “A Walk To Remember,” “Give In To Me” from “Country Strong” and, silly as it may sound, “Now You Know” from “A Cinderella Story.” Most of all, though, would have to be “Vindicated” from “Spiderman 2.” I didn’t even really care for that film but the song is absolutely amazing. I absolutely love all of these songs, though, and hope you guys get a kick out of them, too! I would love to hear some of your thoughts on music from films that have made an impact on you, or that you just really enjoyed! In the meantime, I wish you all a beautiful week and a beautiful life!

Waugh had served in WWII. Much of what he chronicles in the novels is based on his personal experience. He had kept diaries throughout the war (even though this was strictly forbidden), so the novel is full of events he knew, but it is not autobiographical. In the hero, Guy Crouchback, we do get the view of Waugh’s view of the war as he lived through it. When the war begins, Crouchback is in his mid-thirties (as was Waugh), wanted to get into action, felt a need to serve, wanted to be a part of the enormous historic cataclysm that would change the world yet had no easy place to fit in. Guy Crouchback comes from an Old Catholic family; a proud family, a propertied family, a recusant family during the era of Elizabeth and this remains part of their heritage (a major difference between Waugh and his protagonist).

It shouldn’t, couldn’t have taken that long to get to the 7-Eleven and back, could it? I finished off the last of the Cheetos, and went back to the swings. An hour later, I knew something was wrong. It was starting to get dark, and some of the street lights were already starting to come on. There was nobody else in the park anymore. They’d all gone home to dinner or wherever else it was people went after a day in the park.
After we left the town of San Luis Obispo, California, we took a detour away from the Pacific Coast Highway to go northeast on route Highway 101 to visit a few wineries in Paso Robles. Located on the eastern foothills of the Santa Lucia Coastal Mountain Range, Paso Robles is the third largest and fastest growing wine region in California. Scenic country roads lead to more than 180 wineries, where more than 40 premium wine varieties are grown and produced.
Despite the reluctance to get on board with personalized search, the report clearly illustrates that the reliance on search engines isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. In fact, there’s also a lot of data around the increase of mobile search. And that was a new thing not that long ago, as well.
“Crazy with fury I will stain my rifle red while slaughtering any enemy that falls in my hands! My nostrils dilate while savoring the acrid odor of gunpowder and blood. With the deaths of my enemies I prepare my being for the sacred fight and join the triumphant proletariat with a bestial howl!” These are the words of Ernesto Che Guevara wrote in his famous essay, and their effect is quite different than those of the former.
A few of my favourite buys this week have been some Canmake products. If you're not familiar with Canmake, they're a Japanese brand which is affordable and available in Sasa (which is so much better than Boots/Superdrug back home!).
One of the key steps on the ascension path, is Redemption.
No I’m not used to take this green Mayasari Bhakti bus. My route was Grogol – Blok M, ran by PPD (an abbreviation for Pengangkutan Penumpang Djakarta – Jakarta’s passengers transport), route number 20. PPD, which started its service in 1954, was cut off its major routes early 2011 by the Governor of Jakarta and was substituted by the Trans Jakarta busway.

The soup was better the next day, and even better the day after that. Nick added some feta to his to bump up the protein, but I was perfectly happy with my surprising vegan Passover meals. Even my salads weren’t boring this year. My favorite was this one, which is the most prismatic I’ve ever made. Ain’t it purty?
After wandering through the city for a while, I headed back to the hostel where I met up with my German room mates again. Tonight we found ourselves on Bedford Avenue once again and found a small bar where we enjoyed a couple of beers, fried pickles and a couple of bowls of fries. After a little debate as to where we should go from there, Christian decided SpikeHill would be the best place as he really wanted to see some more bands playing. More beers were consumed and we got ourselves an invite to a party. At around two in the morning we stumbled back to the hostel and passed out.
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
