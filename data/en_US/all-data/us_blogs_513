I would like to say I do not hate Portland or the Portland brewers or brewing scene. I was misquoted in a remark I made about ONE early McManamins pub I didn’t care for. I f%$@ing love Portland and all its beer I am a good friend of Van Havig. I drank many times with Don Younger (RIP) and loved him and the Horse Brass, Tony Lawrence from Boneyard ( I know it's in Bend) is a best friend. Portland was the first place I traveled as a professional brewer--to the old Flanders street pub. Bridgeport is one of my favorites. It's the first place I saw nicros on draught 9 to 1 over macro beer and at a stripclub. Portland rules! Put a bird on it! I love it! Aorry I was misquoted
For these reasons, combined with the difficulty of fitting travel to Norbiton around work, I stopped going to AFC Wimbledon.
In his theory there was a meteor which hurdled toward the earth burning and turning. It hit the earth’s atmosphere and much like Superman the meteoric like craft came crashing into an open expanse of desert. He tried to prove this theory by using me as his private laboratory specimen. I of course have had a fear of being struck by meteor’s my whole life not to mention I won’t go near kryptonite. Unfortunately the only “super” power I can report to is the ability to talk a person to death.

But I’m not alone. Recently, a friend called me about a betrayal most foul. Two letters and an ampersand cheated her of a trusty size 14. “It wouldn’t zip!” she admitted shamefully. “It was stuck just below my boobs and that’s my thinnest part!” Another cohort refuses to buy clothes bigger than her reported size. This often results in shopping boycotts peppered by the words, “I won’t cave; ever!”

When Robin and I spend time together, conversation from his side has a distinctive pattern. Every sentence, every phrase, often repeated, begins with an urgently stated ‘Daddy’. I might hear my name a dozen times in a minute. It’s humbling to be addressed so intensively, as though my being there needs to be articulated over and over.
Happy Sunday safari.
GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY: "I think, I wouldn't want to over-concentrate on Bin Laden. He's one of many, many people who are involved in this global Jihadist effort. He's by no means the only leader. It's a very diverse group – Hamas, Hezbollah, al-Qaeda, Muslim Brotherhood and of course different names throughout the world. It's not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person. It is worth fashioning and executing an effective strategy to defeat global, violent Jihad and I have a plan for doing that."
Mix all the dry ingredients together. Cut in softened butter. Gently fold in the sour cream and vanilla. Fold in blueberries. Try not to over work the dough to keep the scones light and delicate. Gently add in the lemon curd, its ok if the lemon curd isn't completely mixed in. Scoop dough (about 1/2 cup) onto lightly greased cookie sheet and bake 30 minutes (depending on size) or until the tops are golden brown.
Now, as for how the different Star Trek captains might commemorate First Contact Day, I see it as one of those things like Gasparilla Day down in Tampa, Florida. Every February, the city launches a festival based around the legend of pirate Jose Gaspar, with a recreation of his pirate ship sailing into Tampa Bay and its crew “taking over” the city. It’s basically Mardis Gras with pirates.
Blessings in disguise, dear One, rain on your promenade. Drink forth as you would lemonade, the sweet blessings before you dear child, for they are sweet and nourishing as honey.

Martha Marcy May Marlene. I feel a teensy bit wicked in pronouncing this my winner, because the film insists on Martha (Elizabeth Olsen, left below) being a cypher, especially to her sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson, right). Martha has escaped from a cult in upstate New York, and her experience there was so life-altering, so all-encompassing, that she cannot say very much at all that doesn’t sound as if it comes straight from the charismatic mouth of cult leader Patrick (John Hawkes). Lucy is mystified by her strange behavior and her strange utterances. “I wish you’d feel more comfortable talking to me,” Lucy says. “I do!” Martha responds. Except, when you get down to it, for Lucy “there’s nothing to talk about.” Their exchanges are almost as creepy as those with Patrick.

Certain aspects of your life are being re-arranged so that you can see more completely My divine influence. Your environment and circumstances demand all the interest and thought that you are willing to give. But, it is My desire to get your attention, to draw your attention away from yourself and worldly concerns so that I can manifest and express My kingdom in tangible ways in, around, and through you, says the Lord. Yield to this work, so that I can establish you in divine order.

According to Morley, chief executive of Man in the Mirror ministries, every third child is born out of wedlock, 24 million kids don’t live with their biological fathers; and half of all marriages end in divorce. Only a third of all children in America will live with both of their biological parents through the age of eighteen. Half of all children in broken homes have not seen their father in over a year. Children who come from fatherless homes are five times more likely to live in poverty, have emotional problems, and repeat a grade.
Every day I work with people who, for many of the reasons I mentioned above, have stopped dreaming so they can set goals for themselves in pursuit of success in the "real world." When I talk to them about what they want for themselves and their families, they always answer immediately: promotions, and learning more skills so they can get promotions, and getting more responsibility so they can get better jobs and more money so they can be successful. When I then ask what their dreams are - what they wish for, what they would do if they were brave, what motivates their hearts and inspires them - they always pause. Often, they pause for a long time. When they do speak, they go back to their professional goals. When I prod them further and give them permission to dream again, they usually have no idea how to answer the question, saying "it's been so long since I've thought about that, I have no idea." Then I ask another simple question: "Is the job you're doing today related to the dreams you had when you were younger?"

Earlier month we highlighted Professor Kari Norgaard’s call for climate skeptics to be likened to racists and ‘treated’ for having a mental disorder. In a letter to Barack Obama, Norgaard also called on the President to ignore the will of the people and suspend democracy in order to enforce draconian ecological mandates.

An hour of contemplating later I decided maybe I’d just use my name, Ruth. Easier said than done. Ruth had already been taken and I was given the option of using Ruth1286759; can there really be that many Ruths out there? I’d never remember it (I’m thinking of having my bank pin number tattooed on my wrist) so I decided to be clever and combine my first and middle name, Barbara.
There really isn't much else exciting to share. We spent a very restless night at the hospital, and the next day they couldn't figure out what was wrong so they sent him home with a no-salt diet and a number for a cardiologist. They did notice an "electrical blockage" for one of his arteries on an EKG, but other than that there was nothing outstanding.
So what now? First of all we all need to realize that we are in this together. Our country’s problems do not belong to someone down the street, they effect and infect all of us. Secondly we need to get the “buy off”money out of Washington. Lobbyists need to be regulated so that they cannot gang up six to one on an elected official. The tax code needs to be simplified and it needs to be fair. And finally, unless our representatives can implement change beyond commemorative coins, holiday declaration and women’s reproductive health care rights, they need to be thrown out and replaced with someone who is not afraid to work for the people.

In four of the five places the word is used as an adjective modifying “Son,” and in one of these (1:18) the Son is said to be “in the bosom of the Father.” In the one place where it occurs as a substantive (1:14), it is followed by the prepositional phrase “from the Father,” which implies sonship. And so we see that in every occurrence John is using the word as a biological metaphor, in which Christ is the “Only Begotten Son” of the Father.

As we’ve been made aware – sometimes in this league it’s not enough for a team to be prepared, technically superior and motivated. For tomorrow I could try and come up with something that might raise a few sprits, but at this point it doesn’t even feel like there’s any room for romance. The naked truth of our remaining fixtures is that we have to beat one, most likely two decent teams – and it might help that they have achieved their main goal for the season and apparently have little to play for.

My lumbar puncture was scheduled for 12 noon, requiring me to arrive at around 11:45am. I had been advised by the nurse to front load on caffeine prior to the procedure and to also have caffeine on hand for afterwards, as this helps in preventing the worst of the “spinal tap headache”. No problem. Jimmy and I stopped at Fresh Market on the way and snagged a generous amount of dark chocolate covered coffee beans and a couple cups of Red Velvet coffee… I was taking this seriously!
Set in the 1920s, the artist of which The Artist tells the tale is George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), an immensely succesful actor who’s career threatens to be perished when the villain of the story comes lurking from around the corner, which interestingly enough is the end of the silent era. Proud (you could see that pride as a second villain) as Valentin is, he refuses to accept this cinematic evolution and attempts to fight what he deems the good fight, that of the silent film. We follow him on his path as he struggles and fails miserably, until the good-note ending which I don’t think surprised anybody.

I'm just really amazed by my kids. I really enjoy watching them learn, grow, develop. I love that my daughter uses the bathroom all by herself in the early morning hours so I don't have to get out of bed. I love that my son gets his own bowl and spoon and box of cereal every morning (and randomly throughout the day, which is a little frustrating when it's almost dinner time and Londo's cooked a delicious meal, but that's a different post!). I especially love to watch them play together and work out their differences and start to understand each other on a new level.
Newly un-sired Tyler surprised Caroline by showing up at the dance, throwing caution to the wind (he has yet to reunite with Klaus). He was a man with a mission: to keep his girl from falling into Klaus’ hot, but evil, clutches. Tyler definitely wins most romantic line of the night with his gem: “I AM jealous, but I’m also competitive!” Nothing sweeps a girl off her feet like a guy comparing you to a trophy. But, we forgive Tyler because he did just exile himself to suffer through the painful transformation into a werewolf more times then I’d like to think of so that he could be free from Klaus. And he did it all in the name of love…What a big softie *sigh*
One wonders how a nation's intelligence resists the radio. Moreover, it does not resist. The radio is a faucet of foolishness. The only thing I can bear listening to is the sports reporting. The high-speed precision of the speakers. They are forbidden stupidity. Which exists only in the fact that some men are kicking a ball around a field and the whole world is excited by the fact.

Our recent post on Teaching Blog Addict has me thinking.... I know I can't wait to read over the summer, but what about my students? How can I help prevent that mega-gap between what they know now and all they forget by the fall? So, I had an idea. In previous posts, I have mentioned my classroom blog. My students are in love with the blog and use it daily! We're starting a summer book club on the blog! This way my students (and I) will read great books this summer AND still get to stay in touch and communicate about great books, authors, themes, and plots! To top it off, the 6th grade teachers have a suggested reading list for the summer... we'll start there!
Things are still going well here with the new baby. The Emperor is starting to return to normal, for which we're all thankful.

My mother-in-law, who is a really lovely person, has come to stay with us while the gentlemen are gone. (I always feel sad for people who have troublesome or unpleasant in-laws. The troublesome/unpleasant people are all on *my* side of the family.) Should be time for a little blogging but we'll see...

Everyone else just seems so trivial lately. That's a horrible thing to say but at least it's honest. Last night as I was sitting in two hours worth of traffic to go 20 miles I heard a news report that stated that the latest tech boom was at stadiums. Everything needs to be wired apparently. Pretty soon you'll be able to watch instant replays on your smart phone while placing a beer order so you don't have to wait in line. One woman who was interviewed said she was a huge sports fan and having every replay right in your hands was something everyone would want. Personally, I don't see how you need more than just watching the game that you're physically attending. I guess I'm a Luddite like that, you know? "Hey, I'm watching something in real life! Maybe I don't need the smart phone!"
The Obama campaign released its new campaign slogan Monday in a 7-minute video. The title card has simply the word "Forward" with the "O" having the familiar Obama logo from 2008. It will be played at rallies this weekend that mark the Obama re-election campaign's official beginning.

You…yes you behind the key board. We are watching. I remember reading George Orwell’s 1984 in school as a kid but I guess I did not get the full grasp of what the book meant. Watching the movie today, it scares me to how true the ideas are that the book shows as how the government rules every aspect of a persons life, including what they watch, read, speak and even think (“Your guilty of a thought crime”).

And that got me to thinking about white flowers.

Can anyone here tell me how many atheists have EVER said that Christianity has all the answers? Now we need some evidence, but I doubt this will be provided, much like any evidence for God, demons, the boogie man, or fairies. This simply does not happen, EVER.

My name is Bev Newman, I live in Hampshire and am a single Mum to 1 daughter of 18, Lucy. Lucy has special needs but is making fantastic progress at college and on work placements and I’m really proud of her. She’s also great at going out and talking to people so is the “legs” of my marketing strategy, going out and delivering leaflets and posters here, there and everywhere. I’m physically disabled due to a spinal condition that causes chronic pain, muscle spasms and fatigue amongst other things, some of which are a bit too personal for a blog! I’ve always crafted and after taking medical retirement 5 years ago, found that crafting kept me same whilst I went through the processes of diagnosis, setting up care, fighting the school for support for Lucy and adapting to a very different lifestyle. Previously I’d worked full time, managed a small staff team and a large volunteer scheme and travelled extensively around Hampshire, the Isle of Wight and neighbouring counties. I trained people to pass their skills on to others, was part of NHS boards and goodness knows what else. Then one morning I tried to get out of bed – my back had been playing up for a while and the Drs were trying to get me seen by specialists – and found I could barely stand. Fortunately due to previous episodes I had some basic equipment to help, so I got a GP appointment and settled in for the 2 – 3 month standard recovery period to kick in! But this time it didn’t, I got worse instead of better, my feet stopped functioning and my Dad arrived on a train after 3 months and dragged me forcibly off to get an electric wheelchair – it was a huge shock! Having been a nurse I was there to make people better – and although I applied all I knew and all the hints and tips I could glean from others with a similar condition nothing worked. I was desperate to get back to work but with a sitting tolerance of 1 – 2 hours and not being able to drive I was well and truly stuffed, the Occ Health team at work and the DWP Dr duly agreed with each other and pensioned me off to a life on benefits.
Me, in control? Me, in charge? Utter nonsense. While we may be able to effect how taxes are spent and public services are run we have no control, none what so ever, over our day to day, the weather, our jobs, our family/friends, anything that really effects us. Jesus, in contrast, is in total control. Good times. Great times. As we’ve seen recently in the book of Exodus, we’d really have it no other way.

One way to circumvent both obstacles is to find a wordladen song for a not-very-wordy book: Smitten by Rachel Hale. One of my brothers, knowing my love for kittens, gave it to me. It’s not very involved (kittens accompany a variety of proverbs and other aphorisms), but I know the perfect song for it.
The invitations had caused quite the stir, just as she’d intended; simple black on white, with the big, bold letters at the bottom – CLOTHING OPTIONAL. She’d left instructions downstairs with the concierge to keep them all waiting in the lobby until the entire guest list had arrived. Then, and only then, were the dozen special friends allowed into the private elevator which brought them up to paradise.
Just as we are about the next band. Marybell Katastrophy know no limitations when it comes to producing non-conformist avant garde playful pop. In the world of "Best new Band in Denmark" (various publications) Marybell Katastrophy, everything is allowed and possible. Releasing an astonishing series of EPs only on 10" and via www.marybell.dk, Marybell Katastrophy have shunned the traditional labels to produce something that's fresh, exciting, and quite unlike anything you've ever heard… Like singer Marie Højlund's former band, Tiger Tunes, Marybell Katastrophy are difficult to describe, though critics have compared their sound to everything from The Bangles on acid, to Kate Bush turned upside down… We think they're somewhere in the landscape between Johannes Brahms, Pixies and David Bowie, with a hint of Bjørk put in for good measure…

Amis's overall assessment of The Ipcress File is fairly scathing, and I certainly don't agree with his entire judgment – I did, as I say, enjoy the novel, in spite of my bemusement. (And indeed even Amis did eventually come round to Deighton's charms, telling Philip Larkin in a letter dated June 18, 1985, "Actually Deighton's quite good if you stop worrying about what's going on"; thanks to Jeremy Duns for that additional insight.) But his sign-off to the addendum is amusingly caustic, and worth repeating. Amis writes: "The whole thing is supposedly told to the Minister of Defence, who at an early stage makes what I thought was a reasonable request for enlightenment over some detail. The hero answers with his usual humility [here Amis quotes the following passage]:
Using a mandoline or slicer, slice potatoes into 1/8-inch slices (very thin.) Layer 1/3 of the potato slices in the buttered casserole dish. Sprinkle on 1/3 of the ham/onion mixture, then 1/3 of the cheese, then pour on 1/3 of the cream mixture.

Evaluative editors, the ones who work with writers to conceptualize and reconceptualize their books, need to possess tremendous empathy—the ability to experience the feelings and perceptions of another. Dictionaries usually distinguish empathy from sympathy by emphasizing that the latter focuses on feeling for others without entering into their particular point of view.
I have shoes from last year:
1. Prayer works – along this entire journey we have had countless prayers answered. For example, before she was born, her situation looked bleaker than a correctable cleft lip and palate. Conditions such as Down’s Syndrome, spina bifida, and kidney malfunction were thrown around by her Perinatal Specialist. We immediately began praying and had our church pray and many of the worst possible scenarios did not come to pass.
But in spite of all these production woes, I’d say they got away with making an excellent post apocalyptic action adventure, one of the best ones out there when we come down to it. I need to go on right here and speak about this films production values, which are amazing. Great steps where taking to build the sets, the post apocalyptic vehicles and make all that post apocalyptic wardrobe for all those actors, I mean this was a huge production! The even had an army of jet skies! Everything on this film was made especially for it, this alone represents a gargantuan task. But aside from this films amazing production values, we also get a great cast and interesting (albeit not always likable) characters. Same as in Dances With Wolves (1990), Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991) and The Postman (1997), on Waterworld Kevin Costner plays a rebellious leader, only on this one he is a hero against his will, an anti-hero of sorts. I saw this character as representing the loner, surviving in this cruel world, trying the best he can to look out for no one but himself. Can’t say I blame him considering the kind of world he lives in: one completely engulfed by water! No dry land to be seen! This guy is so tough that he doesn’t even have a name; through out the film he is simply called ‘The Mariner’. He hates kids, and doesn’t want the responsibility of having one. Basically, he comes off as a major butthole through the whole film, but of course, as any true hero would, he soon learns to show his tender side. Deep down inside, in spite of his apparent selfishness, he cares. So we get the true definition of the anti-hero. Like Jack Burton in Big Trouble in Little China (1986), The Mariner is a loner, and remains one through out the entire picture. He loves ‘em and leaves ‘em; he’s true love is really the ocean.
1 coolness
My agent at the time, Charles Kerin, submitted me for it. And Peter Bogdanovich apparently said, “Oh no, I think he’s wrong for it,” but Charles just pushed him. And so finally Peter saw me. I’d met Peter very briefly on the film I did before that, Catch-22, which was filmed out in the desert in Mexico. I was only on the movie for a couple of weeks acting opposite Orson Welles, and Peter was on the set interviewing Orson on an audio tape. These turned out to be a bunch of interviews that went on over many years. Some of them were in Mexico on that film and others were in other places that Orson was – Orson was always all over the world. So Peter and I had met and then two years later he was suddenly a very hot Hollywood director. He had just made The Last Picture Show, and now he was selected to direct this film with Barbra. So he had an impression of me from my role in Catch-22, which was not really quite like any of the roles in What’s Up, Doc? Because Charles just kept insisting that he see me, he did. And then when we met and talked in his office, he had an idea of what part I might read for. At that point they were changing the script from the one by Benton and Newman – who had just come out with Bonnie & Clyde a couple years before – to the script they ended up with by Buck Henry. So Peter called me back into read as it turns out from the Benton-Newman script – and then he gave me the job. It was very surprising. I didn’t expect to get it.
It’s funny how this all turned out. Regardless of whether I win this or not, I’m still happy that I stepped out of my comfort zone to push myself to do something that I would usually avoid.
Next I needed to square up one end of each leg with a handsaw in order to start laying out the through-dovetails and tenons.
Greetings, fellow card enthusiasts! I wanted to make a card for two challenges today: Waltzingmouse Sketch Challenge #96 and Dynamic Duos #1.

I really like the two colors they chose for their first challenge--Pool Party and Lucky Limeade--and here is what I made from those colors:
On reading the poem I was struck by the fact that the rhythms and what was portrayed was not unlike Solomon’s Song of Songs, which are filled with an evocation of sensuous awareness. So I went back to read Song of Songs again. Some researchers see the poems as Solomon writing allegorically of God’s relationship with Israel but in more recent times study has suggested it is more a tract of biblical wisdom – that gifts of God, like love, are to be received with gratitude and celebration. Song of Songs comes from about 1000 BC. My story setting in Eye of the Moon and Eye of the Sun is 1300 BC. Apparently interpreters have looked to ancient Babylonian and Egyptian love songs, to traditional Semitic wedding songs and songs related to Mesopotamian fertility cults and made comparisons… so I wasn’t far off.

An effort is sometimes made to make it sound scientific, but any claim involving the magic word “quantum” in conjunction with words like “natural” or “holistic” (as they so often do) should be examined with great suspicion, particularly when made by someone trying to sell you something. Quantum theory is a model of the behaviour of matter on an atomic scale, and encompasses the indeterminate nature of the existence of particles when their attributes are measured. Things on a quantum scale behave weirdly, and very unlike they normally do in the real world (i.e. on the much larger scale that we’re used to living in).
But one-third of Title III districts—which collectively served about one-half of the ELLs that receive Title III support nationwide—reported in 2008-09 that they had missed one or more of their goals for English-learners for two or four consecutive years, which subjected them to accountability actions such as developing improvement plans and notifying parents of their status. In those districts that fell short for two or four consecutive years on their goals for ELLs, 71 percent also were identified for improvement or corrective action under Title I of the NCLB law.

At the 1:31 mark of the video, Bryan Simpson from New Belgium Brewing Company here in Colorado, says: "Craft brew industry is really the idea of having a vision, taking a risk, building something from the round up... It's a great reflection of the grit and integrity it took to build this country from the ground up." There's more to that then just some nice words. Beer not only built this country, but sculpted our world. If you haven't seen "How Beer Saved the World" on Discovery Channel, do so. (You can actually watch it online now).
Endoparasites (parasites living on the inside of a host) are most often intestinal in our pets. Those we detect the most include roundworms, tapeworms, hookworms, whipworms, giardia and coccidia. Dogs and cats can often be exposed to intestinal parasite eggs in their outdoor environment and ingest them. Treatment is specific for the type of parasite encountered.

This is the conundrum. Finding two very distinct platforms, I feel like I should treat them like sisters - give each of them loving attention while understanding the different personalities they are. They both have some of the same friends, but they also have different friends they play with (friends = followers). I ask myself, "If I find the same information on Twitter, why should I follow on Blogger...or vice versa. It's that ugly redundant head poking it's way into the twisted wires of technology.

Once Tom filled us in on background information, he turned us loose on his collection of things to print, and tools for printing. We had access to black fingerprint powder, magnetic powder, powders that fluoresced, and a collection of things he'd fumed with super glue. We discovered relatively quickly that he wasn't kidding. It wasn't easy for us to find prints, even when we were the ones making them and knew exactly where they were. To get my prints on a plastic fast-food cup, I first made sure I touched my fingers to my face (to pick up extra oils), and then planted them firmly on the cup. After that, Tom lifted them using tape and put them on a card.

Favorite Frozen Food: Though it may not be as good as fresh made, sometimes frozen foods actually deliver well on flavor. Maristella's Fine Foods Seafood Pot Pies were delicious, and someone might not even realize they were frozen. With intriguing flavor combinations like Lobster with Saffron Scented Creamed Corn and Wild Alaskan Salmon with Horseradish & Chipotle, the pastry was flaky and contained plenty of seafood. If you need a quick fix for dinner, give these a try.

God had a message for Paul, which would not be in the Law or the prophets. How would this be communicated? Paul said, “I was in a trance.” That word, “trance” is from the Greek word ekstasis from which we get our English word, “ecstasy.” It is defined as a “condition in which ordinary perception and consciousness are withheld and the soul (mind) is susceptible to the message imparted by God.”

For now I'm bored senseless and feel very nauceous. The implantation was a breeze though - similar to an IUI - except that you arrive at the office with an uncomfortably full bladder. This allows the uterus to be seen better as the catheter of babies is sonogram-guided into your body. The embryos are put inside the uterine cavity. The progesterone shots I've been taking are to cushion the lining and create a good baby house. The whole process took about 20 minutes then Mat and I were wheeled into reovery to hang out - and me lie flat on my back - for almost an hour and a half. Mat suited up in scrubs and went into the OR with me. I told him this might be our only chance of ever making a child and I felt it was appropriate that he at least be in the room with me. He gets weirded out easily and at the very end when my Dr inserted a catheter and drained my bladder on the spot I could see Mat's face turn green. It was sweet relief for me though!

The Sainte Marie du Mont des Cats abbey in France has played an interesting role in the history of brewing. In 1831, monks from Mont des Cats (which my mind really wants to translate "mountain of cats"--it's not) joined a hermit and founded Sint Sixtus in Wesvleteren. Fifty years later, fearing repression from the French government, the abbot sent an envoy to scout a possible location to land should they have to pack up and flee quickly. That monk located a sheep barn in Koningshoeven in the Netherlands that somehow struck his eye as ecclesiastical.
I found a book on a shelf that looked readable, then sat down sideways in the chair, so my back was against one armrest and my legs hung over the other, the kitchen door in front of me, the balcony behind. There were no lights in the apartment or out on the street, but the heavy clouds weren’t blocking the moonlight for the time being, which afforded me the opportunity to read, looking up after every page or two to double-check that things were quiet and still. It might have been peaceful, if not for Shadow Stalker’s occasional grunt or scream from the direction of the kitchen. On occasion, she went into her shadow state for a fraction of a second, then reverted back before the wires passed through her. Regent hadn’t called out, so I assumed all was well.
I handed back the scooter, laughing. He proceeded to lecture me, in minute detail, about the various methods of tackling cracks in the footpath. (I think he's spent too much time with his Dad...)

The lavender we planted two summers ago is turning green again after the winter. And it was looking leggy. I squatted for an hour, clipping away dead wood, tidying, shaping, peering at tiny silver shoots, trying to determine how the plants would look in a few weeks' time when they had filled out.

Its use as a painting pigment is first reliably recorded by Marco Polo in 1271. The semiprecious stone was mined in Afghanistan, purified into the pigment Ultramarine Blue “from beyond the sea”, and imported via Persia to the Mediterranean. About 1390, Cennino Cennini gives very detailed instructions about the process of extracting the speckled yellow-gold color Pyrite and white streaks of Calcite. This resulting pigment was used from 1271 until it almost ceased to exist around 1840s. Its price has always been extremely high, equaling or exceeding that of gold. It is so expensive that painters usually used to invoice their clients for it separately or ask them to supply it. A privilege enjoyed solely by the wealthy, painters used it for the most important character of their paintings. Leonardo used it

When the nurse got up and walked over to her, and said, “She’s gone,” I stood up and my eldest brother Art and I hugged and cried a little. After we let go of our embrace, I had a vision come to my mind. I did not ask for this…I was not ‘prone’ to having visions or seeing things or anything like that. But I saw my mother, looking as she did when she was about 18 in the pictures I had seen of her…she was incredibly beautiful! She was running and laughing with a joy that I could not begin to express to you. She was holding hands with a figure in a white robe and pulling him along as she ran ahead of him. I knew it to be Jesus, though later someone asked me when I related this story after I returned home, “What did Jesus look like?” I realized that I had not seen his face, so I didn’t know. Mom was the focus of this vision.

Osgood prefaced story on college costs with discussion of college loan interest rate debate. Rebecca Jarvis started on the campus of Sarah Lawrence College. The "all-in" cost will top $60,000. 90% of classes of Lawrence are seminars with 11-12 students. You are paying for the attention of the faculty. That is where the money goes. College tuitions have doubled within the last ten years. Student loan debt is over 1 trillion, more than credit card. Average debt is 27,200 per student, not counting loans from parents. FinAid.org. Jarvis noted Obama had worked the college circuit in the last week. Issue: "how to pay for it." Democrats propose closing tax loopholes for oil and gas companies. Shelley Buffone, a recent poly sci grad, in Pittsburgh interviewed. Sponsorchange.org helps students work off loan debt. In California, tuition has gone up 50% in just two years. Santa Monica College has reduced 1,100 sections. Jasmine Delgado interviewed. Santa Monica tried offering more sections at triple the cost. Two-tiered pricing system was killed. 280,000 students not being served. Megan Ragouska has debt of $23,000. How much debt is too much? Sandy Baum says: debt should not rise above your earnings level. College advantage: $1,000,000 over a lifetime. People work about 40 years over their lifetime.

Nothing in the Trayvon Martin case passes the smell test, which is not to say that Trayvon deserved to die, or that Zimmerman was or was not justified in the shooting.

My house is still a shithole, but the chunks are up, at least. Luckily for me, my parents weren't in here long, as we all took the kid out to dinner (Mexican food, yum!). I will have to do a more intensive cleaning before Thanksgiving, so I'm not looking forward to that. You lot may think I'm joking about the dust and dirt here, but it's no exaggeration. We live in a semi-desert area, with constant high winds, in a house that doesn't seal up. As soon as we dust, it settles right back down. If you go a couple of weeks without dusting, the dust on the bookshelves starts to get dunes and drifts.

As I've explained, the artists themselves feel these things and they try to negotiate a path through it all, and there's much valid critique to be made of what they come up with. But also, at some point, the art itself is blameless. Even if an artist is doing their best to transcend the debris of commercialization (though most are not even trying), the eaters will eat them all the same and feel a slight heartburn perhaps, something that classifies as barely above the nothing. And then they'll burp their transient opinions on some blog. The only remedy to this for someone who wishes to use art to better themselves, is an aesthetic diet: to stop eating so much horror so as to remember what horror means. To stop eating so much comfortable referential-exultant reprise of the past so as to remember what the original emotion felt like. As one rids extraneous fat and toxin, they will lose the taste for most extravagant perversions. Then, when they return to listen to the few great records and they will be again shocked by them. They will fear them. They will be touched by them. And they will have again to live with them, not just consume and pass them as they're trained to.
“Thames Clippers have worked tirelessly with Southwark Council, the Mayor's Office and TfL to try and influence a decision for the pier to remain in the hands of a public body and for a maintenance program to be put in place to refurbish the pier with minimal disruption. Disappointingly none of this has so far come to fruition. As a result of this Thames Clippers have been served notice to cease operation from the pier as of Tuesday 28 February 2012. We are very hopeful that an arrangement will be reached before this date which will allow us to keep using Greenland pier, but we cannot at present confirm that we will be able to continue operating from Greenland pier after that date.”

Jon Lee : Jon was the youngest member of the group. He was only 16 when they formed. After leaving the group he went on to pursue a career in the West End and played the role of Marius in Les Miserables between 2003-2004. In 2006 he starred in the short TV series “The Sound of Musicals” alongside some famous stars such as Carrie & David Grant and John Barrowman. His latest role was the lead of “Frankie Valli” in Jersey boys from 2011 + . I have to say after seeing him live in Les Mis back in 2004 he doesn’t have the strongest of voices and is one of the weaker Marius’s. He’s also had small acting roles on soaps such as Casualty.

“There were a couple of reasons,” he says. “I wanted Duffy to arrive in East Antrim as an outsider, and as an outsider he could cast a jaundiced eye on the toxic politics and culture of the area. And of course, I knew that as a Catholic Duffy would run right up against all the fault lines of the time, which would be tremendous material for a novelist. I grew up in a working class Protestant housing estate and I loved the idea of putting a cynical intellectual like Duffy in among those people. And as a Catholic copper, Duffy can never be completely comfortable in his own skin or in the company he keeps. His life is literally on the line every single day.
Man of Lawlessness: The man of Lawlessness or, in modern language, the man who personifies sin. Just as prevalent as the idea of remnant is the idea of unrighteous kingdoms and kings opposing God and His people. This is a theme, which in the late prophetic books focuses in on the human representatives of this opposition[8]. The exploits of this man, which Paul describes, run completely in line with his prototypical forebears such as Antiochus, Pompey and Caligula, from which Paul seemingly draws upon the worst actions of each into one consummate man of sin.

This paper uses the 2010 Irish Civil Partnership Bill as a lens by which to describe and explore different Christian approaches to public theology in general. Interacting especially with the work of John Stackhouse, it analyses the reasoning behind Evangelical Alliance Ireland’s (EAI) support of the Bill and argues that it represents a Christian Realist position. Various other negative Christian responses to the Bill are identified as representing two distinct theological poles which Stackhouse terms ‘cultural transformationalist’ and ‘holy distinctness’. It concludes that a credible public theology has to attempt to bridge a hermeneutical gap between the realm of personal ethics and the complex realities of a modern, democratic plural state and that this will seldom be easy or obvious. Six themes are proposed for shaping a Christian Realist approach to public theology within a plural democracy.

I know the Optifast products are nutritious and give our bodies what they need. But I’m kind of an organic health nut (ex-hippie type who went to college at UC Santa Cruz), and typically like to eat unprocessed food as much as I can, so I kind of cringed at the list of ingredients in the products, esp. the sugar. I’m not criticizing the products because obviously they work miracles. Our “substitute” leader last night for our Kaiser Optifast group meeting said that in her group, at week 25, she has two individuals who have lost 100 pounds!! Our group was blown away. (Although we may have some who have lost 60 or 70 – I’ve lost 50 now at week 18, and KNOW others in my group have lost more than me!)

Desperate times; desperate measures, as they say, caused me to recently rip off a sheet of baking parchment as an experimental wrap on a really nice cheese. Viola!! Parchment can be found for under $3 for a 30-square foot roll at the grocery, and I always have it around. My cheese paper dilemma has been solved. No extra clutter, no exorbitant prices, and really nice, fresh cheese.

But this post isn't about the traditional returns policy at the business-to-business level. It's about the returns policy and behavior at the business-to-consumer level. For ebooks.
So what can you do if you’re a business that faces the Age of Entitlement regularly? I’d advise that you set a strict policy on how to deal with the most common challenges you have. If your business regularly gets people asking for free product because they are active in social media, implement a policy on how to handle those requests. Hint: A complicated policy requiring those people to send you samples of their writing and/or detail the impact their strategies have on your type of business usually sends them on their merry way.

The first 2 or 3 years I would decorate our home with snowmen and winter-ish decorations. I was happy with this. It was fun, and festive and made me feel like it was still a part of my dreams of having Christmas in my home, but not hurt my husbands feelings. Deep down though… I missed having a tree.

I really enjoyed giving my talk, unhampered this time by a great stage, lights and microphone as at the previous event. The audience were so responsive, and dear Darren was right in the front row looking all excited every time I read bits out of the books. It turned out that there were absolutely loads of people at the conference who'd read Stonewylde, and many of them had brought their well-thumbed copies of the trilogy along for me to sign, which was a pleasure.
I am so excited to post that we are expecting our 4th little baby! I can't wait to meet the new little one. I am 2 months pregnant and feeling very yucky. I think this is the nastiest I have ever felt, but I am to excited about the new little one that I really don't care to much. Lincoln and I have been trying for 10 months with no luck and decided it was time to go to the doctor. Come to find out I am not ovulating at all, so I went on a couple different pills trying to get me going and our first try it worked.

I feel like I haven’t talked about Kasie very much on this blog (probably because I haven’t) or her book PIVOT POINT (which is coming out with Harper Teen in Winter 2013 (probably because I haven’t done that either)), but if you ever met me in real life, especially back around the time when I first read Kasie’s book, or when I was pitching/selling Kasie’s book, or when I reread Kasie’s book, or when I reread it for the gazillionth time just because I loved it so much, or even now, you would probably have heard me say a thing or two or two million about Kasie’s book.

The kind of romance that was argued for in the aforementioned article was the Jane Austen type, the pure, eternal romance that wasn't about which random characters were going to hook up any given week, but about something "much more delicate and elusive." What I think happened in Lost, with the central love triangle which aggravated the viewers for years, was exactly the juxtaposition of these two types of love stories - which is why the majority of the audience did not necessarily pick up on it, or were fully supportive of the ultimate sway of the triangle.
Gardening has become a great hobby for us. Each year we expand and try more. Our second year of gardening we also started canning. James’ grandmother canned everything.

I am going to share our experience of canning strawberry jam.

A few years ago my husband and I were spending Christmas in Athens while I researched my tenth Roman Mystery, The Fugitive from Corinth. One evening, after a delicious meal of meze and chicken, the waiter brought us a complimentary digestif. The clear liqueur was served in a tiny shot glass. At first I thought it was an Italian drink called grappa. But as soon as I tasted it I knew it was flavoured with mastic! Mastic is a resin which only grows on the Greek island of Chios. The waiter said I was the first tourist to guess what it was.
Once upon a time, in a land far, far away – sometimes referred to as Alaska – I was enamored of the hanging glaciers in the state, most especially Portage and Worthington. For the most part, these hanging glaciers have been so decimated by global warming that they either no longer exist or have retreated so far that they no longer “hang.”

I see this disparity between the young and old evangelicals, as resulting from their experiences in being in sudden contact with liberal Christians, non-Christians and mass-culture in general. The realizations come fast and furious: Wait, how can we be anti-abortion without caring about what actually happens to children after they are born? This starts them thinking in all kinds of new political ways, as they see what Cardinal Bernardin called "the seamless garment"--the concept that "life issues" include war, poverty, the environment, immigration and other global concerns.Across the nation this week, 53 percent of Republicans were more enthusiastic about voting than usual, compared to 45 percent of Democrats, Gallup reported. But among voters ages 18 to 29, enthusiasm fell by 28 percent since 2008, and by 21 percent among 30- to 49-year-olds.
Blessings all, many of us have changed, we are no longer the person we were last year this time, whether it be a new job, money, new group of friends a marriage, divorce, separation a college degree, new addition to the family, tragedy or material things some of us have changed for the worse.

The Charleston Chew also has a connection to the roaring 20s, the name for the dance craze! It was introduced in 1922 by the Fox-Cross Candy Company. Over the decades the shape and flavors have changed as well as ownership with the Tootsie Roll Company holding title but manufacturing it under the Cambridge Brands, Inc, name. The chocolate variety that we have today was introduced in 1958, I believe based on several internet sources. I've never had a Charleston Chew and I suspect some of my comments might stir up the passions of some of you out there. Remember our focus is on CHOCOLATE and this falls far short. Just look at hte ingredients, the only chocolate component is cocoa and it is 4th on the list after corn syrup, sugar, and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. True it has a cocoa scent as soon as I opened it but it wasn't what I was expecting from descriptions. First instead of being in four pieces it is merely only long piece measuring 8.5 X 7/8th X 05 inches. The inside is this semi-soft sticky stuff that makes it difficult to pull apart. Given the nutritional values of this there is no way I want to eat more than one bite so how can I perserve it to share without this inside getting hard? I could freeze it, that's one way people eat these. This one bite, yeah you know what this reminds me of? Peeps in terms of flavor and texture. I don't think this had enough chocolate anything in it to really be in this collection.
Over the last weekend, the snow fell, and fell and fell until the whole world became a canvas for pee. My dog loves the snow and I can see where has done some of his dirty business… It snowed so much that Michigan declared a state of emergency. Except it was actually quite nice in my parents house. It seems some of thier rustic living in conjunction with their greening of the house made it a perfect house to be in during this snowpocolyps. When my parents bought the house it came with an outside furnace which warms the water for the radiant heat system. They have enough wood to last a while. All we had to do was put in a few more logs and the house had heat.

Now, the negative feelings kind of co-exist with the above statements, but also my ex and all his nonsense. He keeps blaming me for my daughter expressing her dislike for his new girlfriend. Not to mention, some red flags popped up from things Emma has told me about when she was with him. Can’t really blame me, being a mom. So, I’m trying not to chew him out, and instead calmly ask him to leave me alone anytime he starts harassing me, and just write it all down, for future use.
There are many forms of death. That which we call death is but the culmination of the million forms of death’s subtleties that afflict us during life – fear, disappointment, loss of hope, despair, pain, sorrow, loss of identity, loss of purpose, depression – and not failing to mention the plague of cynicism with which we attempt to bandage blighted dreams.

I've always said all my books have a shape, and OUTLANDER's internal geometry consists of three slightly overlapping triangles. The apex of each triangle is one of the three emotional climaxes of the book: 1) when Claire makes her wrenching choice at the stones, 2) when she saves Jamie from Wentworth, and 3) when she saves his soul at the Abbey. It would still be a _good_ story, if I'd had only 1 and 2--but (see above), the Rule of Three. A story that goes one, two, _three_ has a lot more impact than just a one-two punch.

Speaking of eating—I must tell you again how I much I love your cooking!! You have a real talent in the kitchen, and I will admit that at least one of my favorite things to cook is a down-right ripoff of something you served us at your home: Moroccan-style chicken with figs, olives, cumin, etc. Oh my. That was one of the best meals. Thank you for sharing that recipe!

But when they kick off - with 'Lordy', from their In The Fishtank collaboration with the Dirty Three, appropriately enough - it's like they've never been away. The song's repeated lyric "Lordy, save my soul" underlines that theirs is not a smugly self-satisfied faith, but a frequently insecure, questioning and anguished one.

My favourite stories were Clockatrice, The Greyve, En Forêt Noire and My Heart: A Stone. These all contain a riddle and possess something haunted, in some cases literally, in the others more metaphysically. Clockatrice, the first story in the collection and one of the longest, tells the story of the 16th-century Diana, who was petrified by a cockatrice, and that of modern-day Dru, who becomes fascinated by her story and that of her lover, who had a clock created in her memory, which was ornamented with both her image and that of the cockatrices. I loved the Gothic feel to this one and the visuals it created in my head of the clockatrice being. Another story set in the modern day, the combination of its depiction of the horror that today's economy is for people badly affected by it, and the protagonist's somewhat lackadaisical acceptance of the appearance of what seems to be an animated headstone, lends The Greyve a rather absurdist tone, but one that is laced with hope, even if the ending is somewhat less than happy. En Forêt Noire is a blend of horror, mystery and classical ghost story set in what seems to be 18th-century France. I loved the sensibilities in this one and the ending really surprised me. My Heart: A Stone is a true ghost story, one with a moral about human nature. I loved the narrator and his fey-like nature that allowed him to shift into a hare at night. He's also rather unreliable, as it isn't clear what is true and what is fancy until the very end. I liked this aspect a lot and again, it made for a surprising ending. I loved the stark visuals Lee created of opulence gone to seed, of beauty corrupted by the bitter consequences of indulgence.

Up until a couple of years ago I purchased a diary every single year. This regime enforcer interests me for a day but by day 2 I’m pissed off that it’s trying to dictate my life. I have a memory which hasn’t failed me yet so the need for a diary is like the need for having a GPS to get around Hilton. I like calenders because they usually have awesome pictures to look at. Advent calenders are also a win because you get treat every day, and who doesn’t like a treat every day?

More and more often, I see the legacy of Memento and The Sixth Sense in American indies, almost always with diminishing returns. Stay is a perfect example of this increasingly dull and predictable trend – an overly convoluted story that uses every possible narrative gimmick in order to forestall a painfully obvious “trick” ending. Perhaps the primary difference between the earlier films and Stay is the latter’s heavy use of visual tricks as well – it gallops right out of the gate, making it clear that there is nothing in this film that meets the eye, and thus making it absolutely impossible to care about anything it has to show its audience. Had Marc Forster built these elements into his film, rather than beating the audience about the head with them from minute one, perhaps the whole endeavor would have been less exhausting and pointless. However, in order to do so, he would have had to have something more to hang his film upon.
I recently stumbled across an interesting set of questions. They are used by Asian Access (A2), a Christian missions agency in South Asia, to determine a new convert’s readiness to follow Christ. In the West, we might ask newcomers if they prefer contemporary or traditional worship. As you can see, the questions they ask in other parts of the world are a little different. Here they are:

First of all, one of the positive signs is Israel. Of course, the state of Israel is a totally neutral thing, but the very fact that it looks as though there is beginning in the Jewish people some kind of stirring, as though the process of coming back to Christ may be beginning – that is a very hopeful, very positive thing. This is what St. Paul wrote about, saying that he would rather be in hell for the sake of his people if only they would wake up and receive Christ, Who came for them first of all. When they finally come to Christ, that means it is the end of the world, because all the peoples have been called in, and they are the last ones, the faithful remnant, to come back.

Went for a last holiday run along the river path, which was very atmospheric with fog sitting low on the water. Packed up quickly and headed off planning to drive down through the Grampians to Dunkeld and have a look and afternoon tea at the pub there but we quickly struck trouble as the direct road to Hall’s Gap through Zumsteins was closed due to the flooding and, having diverted round through Stawell, we found that the Grampians Rd south was closed as well and it may be a year or more until they are rebuilt, so that was the end of that idea. We spent an extremely pleasant hour or so eating ice-cream and drinking coffee while the kids played near the creek and had the added bonus of meeting Anna and her family in the playground. A lovely end to a great holiday other than the fact that Andrew had lost his keys the day before. They were to be found again about a month later by the carwash people at Doncaster saving us $500 which we had just decided we needed to spend to replace the key.

I was recently introduced to the Fake Bake line, and I have to say, I giggled at the name. But really, it's a clever company name, no? As a fair skinned person and a avid sunscreen user, I'm never going to have the beautiful tan that those with darker complexions get. And self tanners, although have come a long way, aren't really formulated for different complexion types. Or so I thought. Fake Bake offers Fake Bake Fair! Who knew!? You better believe I jumped on the opportunity to give it a try. What's the worst that would happen? My skin would turn temporarily orange? At least that's what I had hoped was the worst that could happen!

You could see the kinds of fish and seafood that were available from the fish tank and you could also hand-pick your favourite seafood for your dinner. They have got clams, prawns, crabs, and fish supplied by fishermen, probably off the jetty by the dining deck. When we talked about eating seasonally in North America in the last 20 years, the people of Southeast Asia has been doing that for many years prior to the popularity of this trend. Despite having a consistently warm weather all year round, sometimes certain produce, seafood or meat might not be available or they could be too expensive. So instead, we eat what’s available that are equally fresh and delicious.
I mostly remember listening to these songs in the evening, since that’s usually when American Top 40 would air. Somehow, it seems I always missed the beginning of the program, which occasionally resulted in some confusion. I remember one time when Casey Kasem was describing what Elton John’s “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” was about; since I missed the very beginning of that description, I actually believed for a while that Elton John wanted to quit show business and go back home to the farm.

Right through the front door of the gallery is the large, horizontal Space (2004). The suggestive title of the show, “New Spirituality,” places this field of gaudy stars somewhere between the contemplation of mystics and the iconographic tradition of black light posters. The work’s perfect surface and slick finish lends comfort to the idea of it being on a gallery wall, but this painting is in fact the perfect stoner basement accessory. Davis and Langlois of course like it that way, and the work points to the spiritual reality of certain Americans as being akin to the hallucinations of drugs or the errant misreading of people eager for signs.

That being said, don't cringe when I say this and hear me out before you riot on me....corned beef, while technically an Irish dish, is not really what my Irish immigrant, ancestors ate, or yours really.

I was talking with a parent and her son about his summer reading assignments. He told me he hadn't started, and I let him know I was extremely disappointed because school starts in two weeks.

I said I was so sorry, but I couldn't help but point out that the assignments were given in May. She quickly added that she was allowing her child some "fun time" during the summer before getting back to work in July and that it wasn't his fault the work wasn't complete.
Grudem’s thoughts represent an older generation of conservative values which are not being translated into contemporary language. There is a major shift taking place in the next generation of the conservative party, and Grudem’s views are antiquated. It’s not that he is wrong, or that his concerns are not longer relevant, but that his method in presenting them does not speak to the people who will become the next leaders in our generation. It is like writing an instruction manual for those about to retire. For this reason, I won’t recommend this book, even as a resource guide. There are much better resources and they don’t have to carry the name of Christian or biblical in order to be trusted as authorities. So, with sadness, I can’t recommend this book.

Well, I was sick alright! I had tonsillitis, headaches and joint pain, and generally felt very under the weather. After a week of antibiotics, today is the first day that I have woken up without a sore throat and hopefully tonight I won't end up with sore shoulders and wrist joint pain again. I have hardly done any stitching on "Cheerful Notes" - last week I just felt too ill to sit too long and stitch and then with the pain in my shoulders and wrists still hanging around in the evenings I haven't been able to do much at all this week.

I haven't been job hunting like I should be. I have a few applications but they all are half-filled out. Motivation is definitely not at a premium here. It also doesn't help that I get very demotivated when my family is home. That's my own fault really. I chosen not to be around mom when she is smoking and told her that in hopes to help her realize she needs to stop or at least slow down, maybe even smoke outside like dad has been. But, she won't stop and I now cannot tolerate the stench of the second-hand smoke anymore, even with my shirt over my nose to cover it. Yes, in the past, I would sit in the living room with shirt over my nose just so I could stand to be in the same room as her. My family enjoys teasing me for it but I won't stop that. Smoking bothers me.
I currently have a guest futon in the den, and there are no doors or curtains in the den for privacy. You're just there, sleeping in the middle of my house. Sub-par guest conditions for sure. Alas, I think I will end up selling this adorable luggage rack at the flea market in July.

As for works that discuss the history of early Islam and its development in particular, Hugh Kennedy, now head of the Arabic department at the London School of Oriental and African Studies, published a work, entitled The Great Arab Conquests: How the Spread of Islam Changed the World We Live in, which gives a very enjoyable narrative of the Islamic expansion, as well as explaining how the Islamic expansion affected the nature of the Western world. It’s a long work (about 500 pages), but in very large type, and very easy to read. Kennedy is an engaging author, and he tells the story of the Islamic expansion in an easy, fluid manner.

For my entree selection I went with the Cappellini Garda, cappalleni pasta served with jumbo lump crab meat, fresh diced tomatoes and arugula in a garlic white wine sauce. The dish was first-class with lots of crab meat swimming in a tangy cause. The portion was large enough that I ate plenty and took the remainder home for another dinner.

If you've read a few articles in this mish-mash of a blog, you'll have noticed a few trends:
The Arabian Nights adventure came in in a blaze of glory with The Thief of Bagdad, and after years of diminishing returns it went out in a blaze of glory with The 7th Voyage of Sinbad. There would be other movies in the genre -- Harryhausen himself would make sequels, and pretty good ones, in 1973 and '77 -- but these two movies, each in its own distinct way, are the unassailable peaks of the form, never equalled, much less surpassed.

As we all know, in 2010 Haiti suffered a severe earthquake that killed an estimated 316,000, injured 300,000 and left over 1 million people without a home. The purpose of this assignment is to create a ‘re-awareness’ that funding is still needed in Haiti so that life is able to be recreated on the island. Everyone is quick to respond immediately after a tragedy like the earthquake in Haiti, but forget that help is still needed down the road.
As a kid, I dug the original Clash of the Titans with all of its Ray Harryhausen’s awesome stop-motion monsters but I haven’t seen the movie in over twenty years. I don’t own it, and can’t convince myself it’s worth the $7.50 it would take to buy the DVD. I feel like I want you to know that so you can decide how colored my review of the recent Louis Leterrier film is or is not. FWIW, I really liked Leterrier’s Incredible Hulk.
When the temperature reaches 290 degrees or the hard crack stage, remove the pot from the heat. This is important because even if you turn the heat off on an electric stove, the element stays hot and you can burn the sugar.
I wasn't sure how to pick a name this time around (I usually think on names for quite a while and we have running lists). I wanted to have something with meaning, but also something I love and gives personality to our little girl. Sunday night, we started looking. We had a nice little list going of names to think about and some great meanings. Ones that meant gift, joyful, perfect, beautiful, etc. We were mostly searching by meaning instead of by name.
Emmaus is a national organisation with a branch in Leeds. The offer supported living and work for previously homeless people. The community works together collecting, renovating and selling donated furniture. You may have seen their small stall on Leeds Market, but did you know that they have a bigger showroom just outside of the city centre near to Quarry Hill?
I imagine their bathroom is a huge marbly sort of affair with flattering lighting and double basins so that they can perform their impossibly glamorous ablutions in tandem. I don’t suppose their shower has a few areas that need re-grouting and some stains on the skirting board where Victoria has been a bit over-enthusiastic with her hair dye.
Moments like these are a great equalizer as it forces the very powerful to stand side by side with those who are mere mortals. In many ways it is a perfect illustration of the idea of community. Community comes from the Greek word Koinonia, which means, “Coming together.” Something that happens very often in a superhero team. That team is something huge, even bigger then one single member. As Nick Fury tells Tony Stark at the end of the first Iron Man movie,” Did you think you were the only superhero ? You have taken a step into a much larger world and you just don’t even know it yet.”

We were all so excited about Manny, even my husband. We would look in on him regularly to see his growing progress. It seemed as if he was growing before our very eyes. The kids would climb up on the counter to check in on him. We watered him with bottled water. We even decided that Manny was going to be an indoor tree until we purchased our dream house and planted him outside. We even had plans to get Manny a girlfriend mango tree, not only to keep him company, but to assist in the germination and production of delightful offspring which we would enjoy for decades hence.

Albion Dock opened in 1860 as an enlargement of a timber pond. Its general orientation is now marked by the Albion Channel, a shallow canal leading from the Surrey Basin (now known as Surrey Water) towards the Surrey Quays shopping centre emerging in Canada Water, the former Canada Dock. Albion Dock had been infilled but the canal was excavated during the dockland regeneration work, with the spoil used to create Stave Hill.
A few years back I saw a TV Guide list of the worst television shows ever, on which Hogan's Heroes clocked in at fifth place. That's absurd. I can only assume those behind Hogan's ranking on the "worst" list have never actually watched the show and mistakenly believe Hogan's Heroes to be set on a concentration camp. Like Billy Wilder's Stalag 17, a really good movie to which many comparisons can be made--perhaps another time--Hogan's Heroes is set on a prisoner-of-war camp. Big difference there.
I think not! I'm not *sure* where it went wrong, but in looking at other fondant for bees recipes I found that the hot sugar mixture is allowed to cool somewhat, then beaten, then allowed to cool down the rest of the way. The recipe in this book has you pour the molten hot sugar onto a dish, allow it to cool a bit, then pour it into a loaf pan or other similar mold. Maybe we were supposed to beat it in between the two receptacles? Otherwise, why use two dishes? It says the final product can be sliced. Mine is scoopable--not sliceable. That could be a temperature issue, though, so I'll try it again and cook it hotter. Anything for my furry little girls and their promise of honey later on!
Quantum mechanics may explain how birds actually see the earth’s magnetic field, at a subatomic level, and how they can tell a northern direction. Evolution has no explanations for such subatomic sensing. But this design feature is “clearly seen.”
1960 turned out to be the magic number for Cline: by its arrival she had already traded her miserable marriage for a happy one, bore her first child, come to the end of her contract with bloodsucker McCall, and gained full-time membership with the Grand Ole Opry. That year also featured the release of her crossover hit I Fall To Pieces. 1961 had more trials in store, however, and the singer was given her second near-death experience when she and her brother were involved in a head-on collision while driving in Nashville. Cline was thrown through the windshield by the crash, and received a life-threatening gash across her forehead and a dislocated hip. While recovering in the hospital afterwards, she heard a tribute sung for her on the radio by up-and-coming singer Loretta Lynn; the two meet soon afterwards and immediately became close friends.

I’ve been thinking about the Zoroastrian idea of truth, which is called “Asha”, the cousin of the Hindu principle Rta. Asha and Rta both represent universal order, but Asha carries a strong moral connotation. It connotes societal order that results from honesty in human relations. It is such honesty that is the fabric of human commerce, and I am using the broadest definition of “commerce,” including not only the exchange of goods and services, but also intellectual commerce, social commerce, cultural commerce, and even spiritual commerce. Without honesty and trustworthiness, commerce cannot thrive and society loses its very fabric. Hence it can be seen that the two named characteristics of Good and Evil in Zoroastrianism—Asha and Druj—exhibit the emphasis that Zoroastrianism places on human relations, i.e., commerce.

Ah. Now we start getting somewhere. You don’t actually have to celebrate Women’s History Month (although it would be pretty cool if you did) but if you can come up with 3 to 4 ideas that are related to women’s history and your blog, you have at least 3 to 4 blog posts. You can even take that a step further and give link love, product reviews, or memory posts (I remember when…) based on those 4 ideas that you just brainstormed. All with that general spark of “Women’s History Month.” And, by the way, you don’t have to use those topics in just the month of March!

As soon as he leaves, I demand that they take me back to my hotel. In that moment, I realized that there girls weren’t real friends to me. Not only had they put me in physical danger by driving while intoxicated, but they had put my entire future in jeopardy by committing a felony in my presence. I also realized that if I had been in their position, they probably would have hung me out to dry instead of bailing me out they way I had done for them. That was the last time I spent any time with either of them.

Drinking plenty of fluids is also essential when you're sick. Your kidneys work overtime when you're fighting infection so keeping them flushed out is a must. Herbal teas are ideal as they not only hydrate, cleanse and flush out your system, but they one of the tastiest ways of taking medicinals! =) Above is my third cup of Fruit Felicity tea. The herbs in the blend are excellent for treating a cold. I love this picture. A frosty window + a steamy cup of tea = comfort and happiness.
The obsession with the new is of course old hat. A lot of the most moving, enjoyable or interesting experiences last year stemmed from re-visiting places, books, artworks, histories and ideas. So here are some of my rediscoveries from 2010 in no particular order:
JAW: Challenging convention? Certainly not at first. I grew up in southern Illinois in a working class town. I had little access to or knowledge of a visual creative world. I went to schools too poor for art classes. I became interested in photography after I graduated from college. My mother and I took a photography class from a high school shop teacher in a neighboring town that had grown up around oil refineries. These same oil refineries have since become part of my current project DOG TOWN.

We at Book Sake are big believers in reading. Did that come as a surprise? I doubt it. As a mom I've always held to the idea that my son needs to keep reading even when he's not in school, that means all summer long he's reading even more than he does during the school year. Why? Because kids lose some of what they learned during the school year if they take time off from practicing those things. (Well adults do this also.) My son has come home from school before thanking me for having him read as much as he does, now in the 9th grade - he is realizing that this is something that has put him ahead of his classmates. He has a bigger vocabulary and has an easier time with many of his classes and we both believe it's due to his reading skills.

The Iraqy war was a typical example where distorted false information lead to the deaths of thousands. The main humanitarian message and driving force, accepted by most people for the rationalization of this war, was "weapons of mass destruction". Later when no such weapons were found, both Bush and Blair had to admit that they erred in their acceptance of false information. The people worldwide who supported this war, excused themselves later by saying that the world is in any case better off without a tyran like Saddam Hoessein who was responsible for deaths of many in his country as well as for those during the war in an indirect way. Saddam Hussein was executed in December 2006, but still the country is plagued by conflict and instability (six years later).

In fiction, we can’t just add elements willy-nilly.

In addition to this, Soweto had 300 churches, 365 schools, 2 Technical Colleges, 8 clinics, 63 child day care centres, 11 post offices and its own fruit and vegetable market.

Owner of the Korky’s chain of shoe shops, John Corcoran has unveiled the latest in a series of banners above his shop on Grafton Street in central Dublin. John has campaigned for several years to have Upward Only Rent Review clauses in pre-February 2010 commercial leases abolished; he himself is understood to be in an ongoing court battle with his own landlord Canada Life over the rent on his Grafton Street store. The previous banner – unfurled in August 2011 and pictured here – accused the coalition government of being liars after the sudden abandonment of reforms to UORR leases promised in both Labour and Fine Gael’s election manifestos for the 2011 general election.

Mahy has created the closest thing to a High Fantasy that she has written for a long time; it's a complex plot covering a long period so I won't summarise it all. Heriot is the hero, a boy with special powers - a common enough theme. But he also is inhabited by another consciousness which is usually dormant and that is splendidly done. He has prophetic visions though oddly the one he has right at the beginning is apparently forgotten; it is certainly never returned to.

He moved out on January 2nd. I left for the day. I just didn't want to be here and watch him pack up 1/2 of our life, with his friends, and haul it away. None of this has been easy. Necessary, but not easy. I went to his place the day after...with our daughter. It's a nice enough place...personally, I would have rather been the one to move. I don't really want to live in this house...It's my husbands childhood home. We've made a lot of changes to make it 'ours'...but it still doesn't feel like Mine. However, with the kids in school, we both decided it was best if he was the one to move. While I was visiting his new place, my mother was there. She's been completely UNsupportive of me and my decision, although she will completely deny that to your face...She asked me what I thought...I said 'it's nice'...to which she replied 'well its not HIS home'. She's just a bitch. More on her later.

The pads can be used on vinyl tile, marble, terrazzo, concrete and other floor types and will deep scrub Altro flooring. An Excellent to save on the cost of strippers.
One of the selling features of the Kia (which originated in south Korea) is that it comes with a 10-Year/100,000 Mile warranty which covers all the major parts (the technical term is the "drive train", whatever that is). Now 100,000 miles is a lot of miles. It used to be that in any given year most people typically drove about 10,000 miles, so that 100,000 mile warranty would last a really long time. I don't know about most people, but I don't put 10,000 miles on my car in a year....it's more like 15,000 miles! (I drive around a lot...from pillar to post, you might say, as everywhere I go in Austin seems to be at the farthest away opposite corner of the city.)

Hello everyone and welcome to the FELINE THANKFUL BLOG PARTY and HOP!! I became involved with Feline Playful in December of last year and it has been such a wonderful experience working with the fabulous DT. We decided to throw this blog party and hop as our way of saying thank you to the Feline Playful followers - over 1800 of you and counting - and thank you to the craft companies and challenge blogs (we're tracking over 500 challenges!) that inspire us to keep crafting.
In a desperate attempt to get out of debt, I go back into the private sector, pursue some interesting investments in a high-tech firm, and... well, long story short -- I've integrated my consciousness into a massive, superintelligent computer system that crushes humanity and rules the world.
Click here to get my Dr. Seuss Math and Literacy Centers- These are centered around Green Eggs and Ham, the Cat in the Hat, and Fox in Socks. I'm working on a literacy companion for The Lorax, Horton Hears a Who, and The Sneetches. Hopefully they'll be up by the end of the week.
I'm super excited to participate in a group reading with my AMAZING students from University of San Francisco this Friday, May 11th at 7:30 pm if you happen to be in the city looking for something fun to do. Our final project this term was to design and publish chapbooks of new work, and we'll launch these books for FREE at the Green Arcade (1680 Market Street, near Gough) in just a few short days!
The physical body may manifest its issues this month through bones, teeth, liver heat, skin rashes, and respiratory challenges. Increase your calcium, cool the liver, eliminate worry and anxiety (too many thinking) and be conscious of the grief of unresolved disappointments that lung issues manifest. It is also a good idea to take an iodine supplement to support the thyroid.

Ke$ha- Animal My favorite guilty pleasure artist, defies convention merely by spelling her name with a dollar sign. I must also add that I don’t feel very guilty about listening to her. Oops. Besides, most of this is so fun to dance to. And I think she actually has a lot more talent than seemed evidenced upon first glance. Or second glance.

So you all know that Summer & I went to the coast with my dad & grandparents for Gabriel's 1st birthday... and that didn't go badly, it just didn't go how I expected or wanted it to go. I felt like it wasn't about him. I so upset and crying& Summer was the only one that even acknowledged that I was crying/hurting/upset. The rest of my family acted like they didn't even notice my crying. Anyway see previous blog for that news.
As a gorilla who lives in the wild, nestling snugly in the bosom of Mother Nature, I can’t condone artificially enhancing the bottom by cutting and sucking and pumping it. If Jenny had told me about her plans for cosmetic surgery, I would have invited her to stay with my tribe for a couple of months. There is no better way of getting your butt in shape than living like a gorilla – our tree-climbing, kick-dancing, flesh-massaging lifestyle goes hand-in-hand with a rock-solid rump. Some of us had buns of steel before steel was invented.

Defense attorney Jose Baez objected to the first panel of about 100 people in its entirety, saying that it wasn’t representative of Orlando’s demographics because it had only two Hispanic and four African-American jurors.
*Another thought is that you might find a friend or acquaintance who is willing to barter books they have that you need for products or services you can provide. Maybe your friend has the entire Sonlight 4 curriculum and her youngest student is in fifth grade. Will she barter that curriculum against piano lessons for a few months to see if her student is really serious?

Now I sit, along with all of you, 3 years after reading Three Cups of Tea, 8 months after reading Stones into Schools, reading about Mortenson’s character assassination. Although I don’t know exactly how publicized this is in the States, I fear the 180 degree shift in public opinion that is all too familiar for those of us who know the James Frey story.

The band had to take a twenty minute break (yes even Cajun musicians need to go to the bathroom) so all of the Bayou Teche Brewing crew staggered to the bar to get another round of cold bottles of LA-31s. When the band returned, they immediately fired up an up-tempo waltz as the first song for the final two dances of the competition. Three styles of dancing were represented by final couples. One couple was old school, dancing clutched to each other like you watched your grandparents do. The second couple was younger, forsaking the old school style of dancing for a newer, flashier and dancing open and away from each other form. The third couple waltzed a style somewhere in the middle between the schools, taking the best moves from each.
Through this blog, Nora has been appointed as a prophet to the nations, and to her Mommy and Daddy! She has touched so very many lives just simply by being born. I realized very early on that there was just no easy way “out of this”. Yes, I was given other options that may have seemed like an “easy out” – but was it really? Look what we, ALL OF US would be missing out on!! I must be the luckiest person in the world to get to cuddle day and night with this little miracle, a tiny prophet to the nations. Thank you, God!! Thank you, Nora!! And thank you to all of you who have shared with me how Nora has affected your life. I am forever humbled and grateful.
And if you should decide to call, why not try singing our — and her — national anthem. Just for fun.

The neo-geos try to counter this by manufacturing phony examples to try and form a parallel with geocentrism. So Bob first employs the sleight-of-hand that “johnmartin” did, pointing to conditions in various places or institutions, instead of keeping the focus where it belongs – on on actual Magisterial statements. But Bob goes further and claims that the Magisterium has not clearly reiterated the doctrine of biblical inerrancy, at least since 1943:

It feels once again like a lack of higher level thinking as the club lurches from a highly subsidised to self-sustaining model. It feels as though Doughty is looking for a quick exit – again understandable – but if he wants to be remembered as any sort of positive force at the club he needs to implement this plan carefully and over time thereby buffering the shocks the club feels from his departure.
It is not enough for us to simply accept Jesus’ work at Calvary. We are held responsible for much more. Jesus’ words in Mark 16 were not intended for the early Church alone. His words are just as vital and real today as when they were first spoken.

Far from helping the world’s neediest, UNESCO’s top priority is helping itself. The Heritage Foundation’s Brett Schaefer calculates that 87 percent of UNESCO’s $326 million budget last year was allocated for its own staff, travel, and operating costs. More than half of UNESCO’s staffers are based in Paris, many pulling in tax-exempt six-figure salaries, with plush benefits and 30 days of vacation per year. UNESCO’s auditors reported that on travel costs alone, the organization was squandering more than $3 million annually via bad management and a taste for business-class airline tickets. A program of financial disclosure by senior UNESCO officials has been mysteriously delayed.

Wasatch Beers though has solved this problem though. Instead of having to buy a 6 pack and maybe not finishing it in a night (even though you can), Apricot Hefewiezen comes in their Spring/Summer Sampler (a compliation of beers Wasatch and fellow brewer Squatters release). So it makes the perfect product for a night with some friends, when everyone might want something a little different.

In Dresden in Germany the Baroque cathedral (1726-1743) was almost entirely destroyed in an Allied bombing attack on the February 14, 1945. Later a replica was built, incorporating a few surviving fragments and consecrated in 2005, also to great acclaim. (Images show the few original stones as darker, evocative amongst the lighter new.)

It’s a sports bar, which seems like an unlikely choice, but not to Professor Cowen’s way of thinking. He chose it precisely because it was an unlikely choice. An American sports bar might mean Buffalo wings and cheeseburgers, but an Ethiopian sports bar? “They are making no attempt to appeal to non-Ethiopians,” he said.

Ashley was, as I mentioned previously, the younger sibling of two children. She and her sister were like best friends until her sister began high school, and made new friends. Feeling like the third wheel, Ashley became reserved and lost all interest in her studies and social life. Ashley started to show signs of rebellion and depression. She cut her hair short and began wearing black clothing only, citing that she was mourning life itself.
The other oil I was sent was their Organic Omega Cool Oil, a combination of cold pressed seed oils, consisting ofa mixture of organic flax, hemp, evening primorse and pumpkin seed oil. This is an oil that is meant to be used cool. It's great for drizzling on salads, whizzed into smoothies, swirled onto finished soups, as a dip for rustic loaves, or taken as a medicament, 1 TBS a day. I know Evening Primrose oil has long been recommended for anyone who suffers from arthritic pain. I found that it has a very pleasnt flavour as well, if not addictive!! I have been quite enjoying a TBS of it every morning.
But extreme hats? I think we can all appreciate the artistry, but honestly… Beatrice and Eugenie were a subject of conversation, but who wants to be spoken about like that?! Also, can we for a minute discuss the fascinator? This may be the best named accessory on earth for the sheer fact that it is so fascinating, and by that I mean it sort of makes women look like those primordial deep water fish that have light bulbs and other fishing rod type ‘bait’ hanging off their heads. Do men understand what we’re trying to achieve with these things? Do we?

Many students, workers, and instructors have responded to cutbacks simply by trying their best to do their jobs, or to study and get a degree, despite worsening conditions of labor and learning. But many within these sectors have also engaged in protest actions of different sorts, in order to reshape campus life and to call for a more egalitarian university. Recent protest actions have offered alternative models of how we might maintain and defend the educational project of the university – models that run counter to those preferred by campus administrators, but that nevertheless operate according to some of the same principles, or with some of the same stated aims.
as many of you know i'm a Jersey girl - last week hurricane Irene stopped by for a visit - here are some pictures i took yesterday as i was driving through the town next to mine, Cranford - remind you, these houses you will see are NOT in a flood zone, FEMA has been there since the storm, people are getting tickets b/c looters are coming and trying to take their stuff off the curbs (has to stay there for FEMA and the insurance companies to see so they can give you $$) - literally these homes were water front property from the storm!
Jackson-Burch could not be reached for comment. A spokeswoman for the Citrus County School District said all executives were in a meeting, and none returned a call for comment.
Life for me has been very difficult on and off for the last two and a half years, just when i thought things couldn't get worse, they did. Talk about being kicked when your down! I felt totally out of control of everything around me, I was not in a good place, and at the time thought it would never end. But, I was wrong, things slowly improved since about February and now we are at a stage, that I truly believed would never come ! But things happen for a reason and I know all these unfortunate times have made me stronger even though I didn't realize it at the time.
Skill - That all depends in the water level. On the day I went, it was a bit more challenging. There are obstructions and currents all the way down and back. For me it made the trip worth while. For some canoeing couples, it was putting relationships to the test. I will very likely go back when the water is higher just to see the difference.

If doing a project or taking self-portraits over a matter of years, I would probably follow the pattern of titling them with places and dates, but in that I am doing my project in a shorter period of time and probably won’t be visiting that many different places throughout, I will not be able to do this. I will however, be able to use words of phrases that describe the situation or moment the photograph shows and hope to give the viewer a good idea of my life/myself as Goldin has managed to do here.

I happen to love fox hunting. I’ve been riding to hounds since I was twelve years old, a wonderful Boxing Day meet in Surrey that I will never forget. People who know nothing about the sport have all sorts of absurd preconceptions, not least of which that the hunters are all ‘toffs’, all upper class rural stereotypes. In fact I have met all sorts of people over the years. One is just as likely to ride alongside butchers, bakers and candlestick makers as lords, ladies and gentlemen.

After a few of the baths, I decided to get a body scrub. I go to the treatment area and tell the lady what I want. Did I mention the lady was in her bra and underwear? She was. So I get on a table and she puts on a glove- think a brillo pad in glove form- smells the glove and kind of makes a face and then starts to scrub me. I am totally naked on a table, being scrubbed with a brillo pad, by a Korean women in her underwear. And scrub she does. I'm pretty sure she took off a mole on my back- it's cool I had been meaning to have it looked at anyways. And lets not forget the private parts- they were scrubbed equally well. I don't think another person, except Adam and my OB-GYN, have seen some of the parts she familiarized herself with. After the the scrub down she washed my hair. Funny thing was, she threw a wet towel over my pelvic region...for what? Modesty? Like she hadn't just been scrubbing all up in there!

Now the area that Ancestry.com enters into murky waters are the family trees, where information is provided/created by the general public. Some of these family trees are constructed very well, and others are...(ahem)...not. The trees that are done well are fairly easy to spot. There is detail provided that is more than just "shaking leaf" hints, references to specific dates/places, and a general thoroughness. In defense of the other trees, I think people fall into that trap of "the name is the same so it must be," wishful thinking, or just not really doing the math/geography and thinking things through. This can also feed into the mentality of, "I found everything I needed on Ancestry.com!" Really? Everything? This makes a genealogist who gets dusty/dirty in courthouse basements, or sits in repositories and views reels and reels of microfilm shudder.

A: If you are writing for the romance market, the book must have a couple and a happy ending. A book can be romantic but not be a romance (think Nicholas Sparks or Danielle Steele), or have a happy ending and not be a romance. Otherwise the parameters are wide open. I would contend that the best romance novels hold their own against the best novels in any genre. Yes, there are bad ones, but, really, every genre has bad ones. Great romance novels are sublime, just as any great novels are. Books one considers great comes down to taste (after grammar, sentence structure, etc.). We all have different tastes, which is as is should be. I would hate to have only one type of book to read. If you want to learn more about the genre, do check out rwanational.org. And if you’re planning on writing a romance novel, love them. It’ll show up in your writing if you don’t.
“Listen,” I said to her, “my suggestion, if you want to save these shakes would be to buy another cooler now. After driving an hour, stop and get another couple of bags of ice to put in the other cooler. After another 30 minutes, stop and switch all of the shakes to the other cooler.”
However, such a statement is valid if we believe in the independent reality of the mind, body and world. It draws attention to the fact that every experience of the mind, body and world is utterly one with awareness or presence. It is a ‘half-way’ stage.

But we recently found Roald Dahl. I’ve been encouraged by both the girls teachers and my instructors to read aloud to my girls, so we picked up a Roald Dahl book, our first one….The Witches, it was around Hallowe’en and I thought that might be a suitable story. I could not put that book down, we read every night. It was so good! So that was done and we picked up The Twits, than we moved to The Roald Dahl Treasury.

Both kids and adults can expect to laugh and be thoroughly entertained throughout the piece, as the previous installments. What sets ‘Spy Kids 4′ apart from the average children’s film is the sophisticated themes, as well as highly impressive performances by Jessica Alba, Joel McHale, Jeremy Piven and of course Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook who play the Spy Kids. These actors really went for the comedic and dramatic moments, creating a very nice balance for the audience.

Mother’s Day has just passed. Mother and daughter met for dinner halfway between their homes, an hour’s drive for each. It was nice. They enjoyed each other’s company as usual. Daughter generously paid the bill. Parting with a hug, she says, “I forgot to bring your gift. I’ll mail it.”
And there are some other memories – the ones that made me stronger, more courageous, more willing to take a chance. They’re not always the favorite memories, but they’re the memories that helped mold me into who I am. And those memories are just as critical to my life, into the creation of a whole person, as the good, sweet, poignant memories.

Fort Sanders, Laramie, a few nearby ranches. How warm and welcoming a house light looks to a lonely night-rding man! Someday with luck he would walk into such a house, strike a match, lift the chimney and touch the flame to the wick of his own lamp, sit down in his own house. He would smell the fire smells, te warm cooking smells, and he would stretch his legs under his table with a faint sigh. He would rest then…he would dream, and he would rise from time to time to add a log or to stir the coals in his own fire.
In response, a spokesperson for the critics (who prefers not to be named) voices words of protest: "We believe that good critics, first and foremost, must be good writers," she declares. "I have met excellent musicians who can't tell the difference between "their" and "there" and who, frankly, have no clue where to put their apostrophes. Some of them can scarcely spell their own names, let alone the words "persuasive", "occasionally" and "Massachusetts". The musical profession, having concentrated its training on the perfection of performance, sometimes neglects the general education of budding performers to a very unfortunate degree. Consequently, you cannot expect a good musician necessarily to be a good critic. This panel will test only one part of the picture, and not necessarily the best part."

It comes back to the register. The register is the best, most immediate way of helping people. Landlords should have to study for a licence, undertake renewals, comply to national standards and co-operate with spot checks. The landlords will moan. They will say that red tape will destroy the market. But publicans, cab drivers and restauranteurs have to earn qualifications and comply with regulations. The NLA will say that honest landlords will be forced out of the business. No they won’t. The register will force out all the cowboys and part timers, who will just have to work for a living like the rest of us. The NLA will moan that ‘rogue landlords’ will be ‘driven underground’. Fine. We will go underground, we will find them, and we will put them in jail.
In Greek mythology the messenger god often comes down from Mount Olympus to summon the hero on a quest. Sometimes the ‘call to adventure’ is a disaster that forces the hero to leave his comfort zone. In True Grit, it is the sudden and violent death of Mattie’s father that calls her away from her accounts. For once, things don’t add up. Meanwhile, over in his terrarium, Rango is bored. ‘What our story needs,’ he says, ‘is an ironic unexpected event that will propel the hero into conflict…’ He gets this wish in an unexpected way, when his owners swerve to avoid an accident and his entire ‘world’ is flung high up into the air. In the first Western mystery, P.K. Pinkerton finds his foster parents scalped and dying. His mother urges P.K. to run; the killers are after him! In some screenwriting templates, this step is called the Inciting Incident.
I used to watch and enjoy the Today show every morning. Now I can barely stomach it, and prefer the positive vibes of Sesame Street instead. I did check in with Today during the headlines segment out of curiosity. They did not tell the nation that the Netherlands is now politically rudderless. I did, however, learn that Guliana Rancic is expecting a baby via surrogate. I wish Guliana the best, but I’m kinda pissed at Matt Lauer.
How much faith do you have to have in that branch so that it saves you? Must you be totally sure that it can save you? Of course, not. It’s the object of your faith, not the strength of it that saves you. You must only have the faith to take hold of the branch.
The main victims of distemper are puppies between the ages of three and six months and older dogs, probably because of the weakness of their immune system. Puppies from cages of animals of mixed heritage are particularly prone to distemper, so puppies from pet shops and rescue homes should be inspected carefully.

You would think that with all the control measures the PLCB has put in place to hamper efforts of underage drinkers to get booze -- which also inevitably hamper the efforts of legal-aged drinkers to purchase and enjoy what is, for them, something as legal and proper as groceries -- that the "fight" would be going well, especially compared to those lax bastards across the state borders, where they don't have our morally enlightened measures in place.

The list includes: hot dogs; dog treats; washable toys; puppy formula; four or eight ounce nursing bottles; baby gates; dog and cat food; washable beds; shoe boxes; Rescue Remedy; Feliway Diffuser refills; heating pads; five gallon buckets with lids and cash donations.

partially because I wasn't sure how interesting it would be to read,
Last week I read an article in the paper about Mothers...it was interesting...the author wrote about all the chores of Motherhood...but I never looked at it that way...it has always been a privilege and a pleasure to be a Mom...my sons mean the world to me...they are the greatest gifts God and my husband gave me...and for them I am eternally grateful.
So, out of pocket for us was $83.47. There are ways you could cut back on the cost of course, if you have a train table already or if you have the lego building plates already those would eliminate those costs and you could also choose to do your table top smaller which would also help cut back on the cost, it could also cost you a little more if you had to buy the paint/stain/etc... but it should be easy to accomplish for under $100.
OK, really I gave her a few more details than that, and didn't shout the word "DIED" at her, but I was also thinking, "Could you fucking make a note of that in the front of my file?

We have the termination trial for Baby H beginning Monday. I found out that I'll be subpoenaed to testify. Super. There goes my plan to sit in my house and pretend that nothing life changing is going on. Our biggest concern right now is that Baby H's mom is "missing." She was supposed to have a visit with H this past week and I didn't hear from her and she's not answering her phone right now. This is a woman who will get to a visit an hour and a half early so she can see her daughter. She has never missed a visit. To say that I'm worried, is an understatement. We talked to her caseworker today and she is very concerned as well. She did go on and on telling me how great foster parents Seth and I are. She said, "We just don't have foster parents like you guys. I wish we had more." There are so many of you out there that would make a great family for one or more of these kids. So many of you would probably be better at this than we are! These kids and their parents need Godly people in their lives to show them that someone cares. The shelters in OK are completely full right now. There are no empty beds in homes or the shelters. This is a big problem and it is not okay. Please consider becoming a foster parent. I have no doubt that God will equip you and bless you and your family for it.

No big deal, I’m headed to the second floor and am only passing through. Or so I thought. Apparently this was an Airman Volunteer Opportunity and probably the bitchiest woman I have ever encountered in my life stopped me on my way through the throng of children. “I thought I told you to put more Gatorade out of the spouses while they were running. Why is this table empty?” I know this face, this woman is the wife of an officer in OG.

“When did you first love me?” she asks, yet again.
“I came to Living Waters struggling with self-worth and intimacy issues. I encountered God in the teaching as He helped me understand that He has given me needs for affirmation and acceptance for who I am. I learned that these needs are real and legitimate; they are not a sign of weakness to be despised or kept hidden. With the loving support of my small group members I brought my deepest desires and longings to God in prayer and He met me in my place of need. I discovered that I am not defined by my issues or struggles but by God’s affirmation of me. My sense of self-worth is in Him. Moving forward, He has given me a new sense of confidence to relate to people as I am.”
First, you can pray for Meghan and Steve. They had their daughter Quinn today (also having Trisomy 13) and she made it through labor like a champ. She's in the NICU now and I pray they get so much time with her!!
Probably above all things is the number of people frequenting a site or using an app is the quickest path. Any site that has this should really be able to sell the eyeballs. The main reason for this is that correctly or incorrectly, the web is still largely seen as a media vehicle and so ‘eyeballs’ are still valued very highly. In fact, heavy traffic may even reduce the sites ability to make money, as was the case with Youtube which only recently started turning a profit more than 5 years after it was sold for $1.6 billion. It must be said that the traffic doesn’t have to be mass. It could be highly sought after niche content traffic of the right people. This could include a membership database.
This is just one of many sources that confirm that Israel believes that Iran is going ahead with the program.
In 1954, m&m's introduced their peanut variety that was at first only in a tan colored candy coating. This was also the first appearance of the m&m characters on television; those little dudes are getting old, aren't they? If you call, I looked at the original or plain m&m's in a previous feature from this online candy shop and I wasn't impressed. I'm less impressed with these in terms of chocolate. Why? They candy coating is just as sugary plus there is the thin chocolate layer but the bulk are these fairly large peanuts. Great for peanut lovers but in terms of chocolate these fall flat. They shouldn't be in this box at all.
Other bacteria (called decomposers) also contribute to the nitrogen load of the aquarium. Uneaten food, fish poop, decaying plants, heck, even fish scales, are all consumed (slowly) by bacteria. This process releases ammonia.
When I got out of the bathroom, I made my way to the kitchen, positive I'd see the moth flitting around the light. Nope. Which just solidified my belief that it was indeed a bat. He was perfectly content staying in my darkened room. By this time it was 4:00 AM and extreme tiredness had overcome me, so I finally gave up. I quickly dove under the covers and pulled them up over my head. In my sleep deprived state, I was somehow okay about dying from lack of oxygen under the covers all night, but I really didn't want guano in my hair. It made sense to me at the time.
The Geneva Bible was the first mechanically printed, mass produced Bible, made generally available, direct to the public, with a variety of Scriptural study guides and aids (including woodcut illustrations, maps, charts and indexes). Therefore the Geneva Bible was the world's first Study Bible. Over 150 editions of the Geneva Bible were printed between 1560 and 1644. The very first Bible printed in Scotland was a Geneva Bible, in 1579. A Law was passed in Scotland that year requiring every household to purchase a copy. The study notes were Calvinist and Puritan in character and were particularly objected to by the bishops and royalty for being "seditious".

By taking part you’ll help FPA raise much-needed funds so they can keep on talking sense about sex. The run is a brilliant experience with a route taking you through the heart of Central London. 10K is a manageable distance for beginners, so you can take part even if you’ve never done a running event before. They do recommend that you fit in some training in advance though.

However, Schiller reveals, Marilyn’s attitude about her sex-symbol status fluctuated wildly. While she was at times boastful of her looks and what they procured for her, she was also by turns insecure and angry. “It’s still about nudity. Is that all I’m good for?” she demanded of Schiller. “I’d like to show that I can get publicity without using my ass or getting fired from a picture,” she continued. “I haven’t made up my mind yet.”
I have kids who do not come in first very often…if ever. They are good kids. They get their work done. They do not love homework. We try to celebrate good work, participation, completion, the journey…etc.etc.etc. But last night we won…I mean we won first in our category (the largest category: biological science) and it felt really good. It felt so good in fact that it still feels good this morning. We move on to district and that will probably be the end of our journey…totally okay. For today, for this moment we are appreciating a little bit of glory…a little bit of job well done family style.

When you and your ex girlfriend ended up being adult dating, did you confidence her? Should you be frequently micromanaging her just about every transfer, it is reliable advice that you didn’t fully trust her. It is common for guys to stress that the girlfriends are likely to feel like the yard is greener on the opposite side by leaving them for yet another guy. Nevertheless, if she has not yet help you but, the cool thing is she certainly won’t make you in any respect. Issues just about every unnecessarily falsely accused your ex of anything, so as to win back a girlfriend, it is advisable to apologize to her you should by using a fresh stone. she could thank you for your reliability, as soon as you might be wide open and trustworthy with your ex-girlfriend, she could admire your weeknesses.

"As we have developed the ability to target people more and more precisely on the web, click-through rates of these hyper-targeted ads have dropped dramatically."The question is, why? If you believe conventional advertising wisdom, being able to target people based on individual behaviors, attitudes, and demographics ought to make advertising substantially more effective. And yet no one's smarter than the facts. It hasn't made online ads more effective. So what's going on?

So, yeah. Mckmess and Mckmama Without Pity. MWoP is basically a site run by these incredibly intelligent ladies and men who should be running the government, as far as I am concerned. Let's talk about completely thorough. They are the best of blood hounds and I can see why they feel as angered at her antics, as they do. Hell, I am even shocked at what she's pulled off in the past and still to this day. I feel sorry for that sap of a husband who either fully knew what was going on, or is completely the sweetest lug who really wasn't watchful and she bullshitted the crap out of him....but I doubt that.

So in April of this year, I will once again be moving. Into another two bedroom suite. But not in a new building (I was the first, and have been the only, tenant in this suite so far). This time, it will be into a very old building (~100 years old but lots of updates like plumbing and electrical) that may or may not have been an actual gigantic house at one point in time.
On to “the other guy”, then. This is a Hulk with a sense of humour, of honour and with a dislike for campy British acting, apparently. The thing that this Hulk has over the other two modern incarnations is personality. Save a penchant for women called Betty, the other two Hulks are all anger. Granted, that is the bottom line of the character, but if that were all, he’d just be another villain. In Ruffalo’s Hulk we have a monster with ties to the man we’ve spent time getting to know and like.

Forgiveness is the final ingredient. Because even if we survive the plane crash, the abuse, the divorce; how do we leave it behind and not let the bad thing that happened to us define us? Speaking of divorce in particular for a moment, I have had to deal with this forgiveness issue. I was wronged by the one person I thought I could trust. I was also wronged by a woman who I loathe at the moment who encouraged my husband to leave me. He now has made this woman a part of my children’s lives and wants to start bringing her to their concerts where I would have to sit there with them. And I am struggling. I don’t want that hurt to define me.
Romans 1:18-25 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of those who by their wickedness suppress the truth. For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. Ever since the creation of the world his eternal power and divine nature, invisible though they are, have been understood and seen through the things he has made.
It’s a sweeping generalization, but not without its truths, that the culture of private property is different in the South. Whether it's xenophobia or an intense protective nature of privacy, it's downright difficult for Willy off the Turnpike to go door-to-door seeking hunting rights here.
Nope, I couldn't quite chose just one track from this album! See 14 above.
I love this cover so very much. And it's a great book. But it feels like only in the middle grade section would you find a gem like this. It makes me wish my children would stay in the middle grade section for as long as possible. Because it is safe and welcoming for them.

Why were the people afraid to join them, despite holding the Christians in high regard (read back to Acts 5:1-11)? Why do you think the church continues to grow during this time despite their fear? What was attracting these people?
Even when our experiences are not the same, at the level of feeling we can understand another person because we all take part in the human condition.
Amazing. When we allow the Holy Spirit to be active in our congregations, we are alive and filled with a sense of purpose, other people want to be a part of that, and we grow.

All these customization options give you a vast amount of things to choose from. Because of this, the game really never becomes boring. There is so much content that to explore every secret of the world, every combination of races, classes, and professions, and every style of play, would require infinite time.

They get caught up in petty crime, a virtual kidnap, a paedophile ring and the life of a successful rapper. The book stands or falls through the character of the Rat (real name Marie-Claire) and here Hughes treads a fine line very delicately. Is she an annoying brat or a brilliant, unusual, credible eccentric? Definitely the latter but it's a close thing.

Prior to two weeks, I would never have imagined being a coach on a state playoff baseball team, let alone a team that included the boy. Remember this post from several years ago and now we are together on the same high school team. The playoff series proved to be too much for our start-up 9-5 (conference record) team and in the end Coach put most of the freshman in the to get some playoff experience.

Changes in your life come at odd times. Often they are unexpected. Epiphanies that paint everything that comes after in a different light.
Big bloody battles and heartfelt dialogue carry this story a long way. Julian Comstock is romantic and unflinchingly honest. With Julian Comstock the titular character Wilson has crafted his own Che Guevara, Ben Franklin, and Casey Jones all rolled into one. Even with the telling Julian is still something of a mystery, but his exploits are inventive and awe-inspiring as he holds true to his belief despite what might befall him. As Adam and Julian try to slip away from the noose that Deklan lays for them they unwittingly fall into the very trap as they are conscripted into the Army and taken to the front-lines and so the legend of Julian Comstock aka Julian Conquerer begins. Deklan Comstock the despot of a president remains a cloudy figure even when he takes center stage. A bit of missed opportunity was lost in not having a major interaction happened between Deklan and his wayward nephew Julian.

Here’s the scoop: Assistant Press Secretary Jack Whittier is a werewolf. At every full moon, he maims someone. When he tries to tell the President, he’s promoted to official speechwriter for the Vice President. When he tries to tell his ex-girlfriend, the president’s daughter, she kisses him. When he tries to tell anyone else, he’s dismissed. Oh, and also politics.

The reasons why the VeganManiacs so thoroughly devoured the competition may take more time to understand. No one on the team had ever done this sort of thing before and they only decided less than two days before to enter, so there was no time for preparation. They faced a variety of teams from ambitious college students, to guys who look like they'd be good at this sort of thing. Yet, at the point when Ross, John and Jeff set down their spoons and triumphantly thrust their arms in the air, most of the other troughs looked as though they had barely been touched.

This is a perfect apple dessert for serving to guests. Not only is it pretty as can be, it has great structure and wonderful flavor. True to its name, it is a cross between a tart and a cake.

I wrote a few months ago that I was going to start making Kombucha and I was nervous about how it would turn out. These days besides a bit of water, Kombucha and Water Kefir are all I drink. I'm finally rid of soda in my life and I don't miss it a bit! Now when I drink kombucha I know I'm doing something good for my body instead of feeling guilty everytime I used to drink a soda. Kombucha is naturally carbonated and it is full of probiotics. My favorite way to flavor it is strawberry, but tonight I decided to try blueberry and raspberry for the first time. You can flavor it with whole fruit or juice, but I found that the whole fruit is better. I use frozen fruit for convenience. One thing I've learned is that this is pretty hard to mess up! The SCOBY, converts all the sugar into something that isn't bad for you. You add sugar for a "second" fermentation (or the fruit) to help with the carbonation.

I had the best intentions today. I really did.
The sea has always been a symbol of change, sometimes sudden and violent change, for obvious reasons, and it is fitting that Marina, who experiences quite a few vicissitudes in her young life, should be born on the open sea during a raging storm; it is also fitting that the body of Thaisa, who appears to have died giving birth to Marina, should be pulled from the sea and miraculously revived by Cerimon's medical/magical arts; for the sea also symbolizes rebirth, and along with the many changes of fortune in Pericles, there are quite a few rebirths — not the least of being Pericles's own.

And this is why Revelation 21-22 paints a picture of a renewed heaven and a renewed earth.—a world where humanity relates to God, to creation, and to one another harmoniously once again.

There are many available books which reflect the past history of African-Canadians or Americans without subjecting African-Canadian learners to this type of degradation. . . We believe that the English Language Arts curriculum in Nova Scotia must enable all students to feel comfortable with ideas, feelings and experiences presented without fear of humiliation . . . To Kill a Mockingbird is clearly a book that no longer meets these goals and therefore must no longer be used for classroom instruction.
I just want to sing the praises of my class. They are great. My stress level is so low. It is amazing! We do have some things to work out, like schedule, talking, testing, talking, low reading levels, and talking. Did I mention talking? I am so happy to say that is my biggest problem! =)

My first encounter with Jane Austen was in 1995. At 9 years of age, my mom took me to see Sense and Sensibility. I loved it! There was so much to admire: the elegance of speech, the clothes, the hair, and most of all Colonel Brandon (I still have a deep, deep love for Alan Rickman). Not long after this my friends and I discovered Emma. Mr. Knightley left nothing to be desired.
I cannot and do not claim that the “what would Jesus do” idea in A.A. came from Christian Endeavor language Dr. Bob had heard again and again. But I can say how popular Charles Sheldon’s book was among the A.A. founders and pioneers. I can say that the expression, “What would Jesus do” can be found in several important Christian Endeavor writings. And I can say that nowhere is this background idea and humble thinking more evident than in Christian Endeavor leader Sheldon’s In His Steps.

For my most recent fit project, I made the mistake of thinking, how hard can it be to fit a skirt? The fact that I still haven’t worked out the last of the issues with my skirt muslin answers that question. So I have a decision to make. Giving up sewing and taking up photography is not a viable option for me. And, having nothing but muslins to show for all my time and effort is way too frustrating. That means something has to give. What if that something were my obsession with achieving an absolutely perfect fit? Now, there’s an idea. After all, I settle for something far less than perfection every time I put on a ready-to-wear garment.

According to Odendaal they had already noticed and followed the Audi at the Xavier Road off ramp.
I set up camp, 2 nice large tents with cots, picnic table, shade canopy, flushing toilets and showers. We also all charged our cell phones (wore the batteries out taking photos!). It was nice to have water and electric here. With everything all set up, we decided to do some exploring without our packs on! We hiked the Oxbow Nature Trail, visited the canoe launch, and hiked many of the other trails around the lakes and such as we watched the sun set. On our hike we came across a dug up turtle nest and harvested some AMAZING fresh grapefruit! After an filling dinner we again enjoyed the fire as we watched a family of baby skunks playing and going back and forth out of their den just past the forest line. It was like watching kittens play!
Lopez said under Mexican law, the group can be held for up to 90 days while being investigated and could face fines on charges of illegal entry to Mexico and possible criminal charges for the fake identification. He said it was also possible they would be considered for asylum if they sought it.

Ever feel like you hit the end of a set and you could do 5 more? 10 more? 20? Then you’re not lifting enough weight! Whether the program you’re working on calls for 6 reps or 15, I don’t care; if you get to that last rep and don’t feel like you could only do 1 or maybe 2 more then you’ve got to either add more weight or find another way to make that exercise more challenging for your body.

Somehow, though, for Whites to prefer those like themselves, it is ‘troubling.’ Troubling for whom, and why? The liberals always act as though their opinions and biases are incontestable facts, while the opinions of White people generally are biased and invalid.

Under B.C. law, it’s perfectly legit for candidates for municipal office to accept unlimited sums of money from unions, corporations and non-citizens. The only requirement is disclosure.

How does that sound for moving up the social ladder? Would be like the grand old era where aristocrats (a football aristocrat?

Cuju being the CHINESE sport that ‘English’ Football is a cheap copy of . . . would be more Posh‘ . . . ) raised massive families commensuerate with their wealth. What say you plutocrat 1%ter Becks worth hundreds of millions (or is that billions)? You play football with passion? Riiiiiight, as a beneficiary of global politics . . . lets see if a ‘Beckham’ from Uganda earns as much, this is not a real sport anymore, just politically convenient poseurs with some incidental talent and maybe money laundering via ‘exopensive players’ or expensive teams’ . . . still Vic would probably love to be ‘Posher’ as a ‘Lady’.

They had one original language “A-Pucikwar” (aapah ki wah?). Originally Puluga lived on the islands and taught people to how to use fire, hunt etc. The first person he created was Tomo (Tama?) followed by a lady Chan Elewadi. Tomo was dark, tall and bearded and lived to a ripe old age among the people. When the population increased, Puluga interfered again and had them all equipped with weapons, implements, fire and their own language before they scattered in pairs all over the country. All there present languages derive from that one original language. The people of this second diversion are again described as long-lived, tall men with large beards. (like our Rishis).

Noting that – by the way – is by no means any intended criticism or slight; far from it. It’s a remarkable collection of objets d'art.
It might also have been useful to have some indication of the social class of the stylish gentlemen she is discussing, but I'm sure it's fair to assume we are not talking about working class men, especially given those "extremists" who patronised London tailors. Of course, its ridiculous to gripe about this minor oversight - we're lucky to have this account at all. And Honor has many more fascinating observations to make as she turns to the 'present day' in Paris:
I've noticed in some great session beers that the balance between malt and hops is not just about sensible balance, neither one being too extreme. It's about the combination, the mix of malt sweetness and hop fruitiness that combine to create a kind of glowing, floral perfume that hovers just above your palate. This may sound horrible, cloying, sickly and effeminate, but is actually the opposite of all those things. And Bathams does this very well.

This seemed important because Siddharth was sincere, intelligent, and had this inherent aptitude of problem solving, and who so ever would pair up with him would have a nice time(I’m just being modest!). And Siddharth too wasn’t that ‘unwilling’ to take me as his BTP partner, for we spent a lot of time together, apart from studies. He played the keyboard, and me playing the guitar, we had quite a lot of time jamming up music.
But stories are vital. Stories never fail us because, as Isaac Bashevis Singer says, “events never grow stale.” There’s more wisdom in a story than in volumes of philosophy. And by a story I mean not only Little Red Riding Hood and Cinderella and Jack and the Beanstalk but also the great novels of the nineteenth century, Jane Eyre, Middlemarch, Bleak House and many others: novels where the story is at the center of the writer’s attention, where the plot actually matters.
But would I even recognize a man like my father? Would I even want him?
You get out hands in the air, as you watch them speed off, feeling grateful that they didn’t summarily execute you as usually happens. Still shocked, a passer-by takes you to the cop shop where you are asked to provide the name of the criminal who just hijacked you. The cops will also ask you how well you knew your assailants. If you are unable to provide a name, or tell them that the criminals were unknown to you, then bingo! Sorrry, we will not open a docket or investigate.

It struck him, how many of the parked, tipped-up buggies behind the Lambright barn had come from Graber Custom Carriages . . . how every family in Cedar Creek depended upon his vehicles and repair work. It was a gift, indeed, to live among the friends he served and to be entrusted with getting their families where they needed to go–and today, it seemed every man, woman, and child for miles around was showing up to wish him and Zanna well. Men in their black hats and suits chatted in clusters near the barn while their women entered the house to help with the wedding feast.
1 and 1/2 months ago I had an experience in Eucharistic Adoration which enlightened me that my discernment is no longer discerning God’s will, but discerning what tools He has equipped me with. I have one of two tools. I either have a very broad love that is able to encompass the community and the Church, or a love that is very narrow in scope and directed to one other person. This has been the theme of my discernment over the past month. I really thought though that I was called to seminary either way. However the issue now is that I seem to be finding more and more that as I embrace a more narrow idea of love that is rooted in a holy relationship, my past sores and scars begin to feel as if they are being healed over. I find myself more capable of complete forgiveness of self and others.
Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.

Aside from being a little bummed about the time, I did something different on this run. I wore compression socks. I have been having trouble with my calves and Achilles and I have read that wearing compression socks can help. Low and behold, I think it worked! I had very pain this time around and my legs just felt "peppy". I did look like a clown because my socks were hot pink and I was sporting navy blue shorts and a light pink long sleeve shirt (not the right combo for today's weather! BRRRRR).
I kept thinking how frustrating it was...

The same thing happened to Lady Gaga, and the same thing will happen to these boys. Teenagers are fickle, and disloyal. I was the same, Dear Reader. When I was a teenager, bands like Limp Bizkit were huge, and I lapped up everything they gave the public (except maybe for Fred Durst’s sex tape, ewwwww). None of us are immune to this sort of garbage when we’re young and susceptible, but having a slight bit more age and wisdom, it does feel like this shit just keeps getting worse and worse.

This area shatters every bad stereotype of the South. The people retain all the friendliness, but it’s astoundingly progressive and diverse. With NC State University, UNC-Chapel Hill, and Duke, as well as dozens of smaller schools, it ties with Boston as the number four area in the country with the highest concentrations of college degrees. There is a definite dedication to education at all levels, with NC having the most charter schools of any state (which are public and therefore tuition-free, by the way) as well as many public arts schools (I live a couple of blocks away from the biggest one in Durham). We have food trucks and CSAs, locally owned businesses with fierce customer loyalty, and masses of people in their twenties and thirties from all areas of the world. It’s a great place to be vegetarian or vegan and there are anti-Amendment One signs in every single yard in my neighborhood.

Here’s the problem: telling someone they need to do “more research” (or if you’re dealing with someone truly arrogant, you might be told simply that you need to do research in general) shirks the burden of proof. In arguments, the person making a positive claim bears the burden of proof in supporting that claim with reasons, evidence, etc. It’s fundamentally the reason why the accused in civilized courts of law are presumed innocent until proven guilty: the positive claim (charging someone with a crime) demands proof, not the negative claim (the denial of such an act).

I was very excited about this book. Not just because it was the winner in 2010 of the Prix Goncourt in France, but perhaps more importantly because it was placed in my hand with the same enthusiasm (and by the same person) as one of my favourite books last year, Lazarus Is Dead. The two books don't just share a publisher, they also have something in common stylistically. Both take factual events, real characters and seek to retain veracity whilst also resolutely remaining works of fiction. Both authors speak directly to the reader about the process of writing the book and include references to other artistic treatments of the same subject. But, and it's a big but for me, whilst they may appear to be from the same stable, the two books are very different beasts. Whilst the approach and delivery of Lazarus made it feel like an inventive piece of fiction Binet's 'novel' feels like a piece of non-fiction with too much authorial intervention and not nearly enough invention.
It would certainly help Israel to explain abroad its needs and challenges if we could decide for ourselves where our physical red lines should be drawn. But more importantly, we owe it to ourselves. We need to encourage our people to live where their presence is vital, and tell them honestly where it is counterproductive. The blurring and the inconsistency are the hallmarks of a childish refusal to take hard decisions.

This couple was all like, “Umm, whatever, the world is my stage/bed.” Except, it involved this guy tying up and gagging his girlfriend in the back seat of his car, naked. Somehow, they were spotted outside the grocery store. How she ended up in the back of her car naked and all tied up, I don’t know. Did she leave the house like that? Did she become naked along the way? Why was she brought along? She obviously couldn’t help shop looking like that (and definitely not if she was restrained). Did they think that no one would notice? Well, probably.

A BIZARRE swimming incident on Windermere coincided with the announcement that a paranormal investigator will plumb the lake’s depths in search of a giant creature. Thomas Noblett, 46, was swimming the lake this week when he was suddenly swamped by a three-foot wave of unknown origin. A spate of eyewitness sightings reported by The Gazette during 2006-2007 described a 50-foot long serpent-like animal surfacing on Windermere. Psychic Dean ‘Midas’ Maynard, who came to prominence by accurately predicting sports score lines and X factor winners, will hunt for the beast in September. Mr Noblett trains on the lake for four hours every day in preparation for a channel swim. Never having had to deal with anything more than the odd passing trout, the 46-year-old said he had since reconsidered the legend of the Windemere monster. “I didn’t entertain it before. Now when I’m in the lake it has my full attention,” he said. Mr Noblett, managing director of The Langdale Chase Hotel, was swimming close to Wray Castle at 7am on Wednesday morning when the 3ft swell hit. He and swimming trainer Andrew Tighe – paddling in a boat beside him – were the only people on the lake. “We had gotten up early and Windermere was crystal clear. The lake was totally empty apart from us and all I could hear was the slapping of my arm against the water,” explained Mr Noblett. “All of a sudden this wave just hit us. Andrew said ‘where the hell did that come from?’ and it made the boat rock from side to side,” he continued. Treading water, alone, in the centre of the lake, Mr Noblett watched as two large waves sped towards either shore. “It was like a big bow wave; a three-foot swell at least. There was two, as if a speed boat had sped past, but there were no boats on the lake,” he said. Previously an escape from the jellyfish he dodges while training at sea, Mr Noblett said the lake’s depths were not so inviting anymore. “I always look forward to swimming in Windermere, now I’m starting to get the fear. Twice I have looked down and seen fish, but only small trout. The reeds sometimes scare you, because they suddenly appear like triffids.” Dean ‘Midas’ Maynard will search the lake for the monster in September. Mr Maynard, with a background in ghost hunting, is currently searching for a sonar-equipped boat to use in the search. “It’s a fascinating subject. I’m not saying there is or isn’t something down there. Most eyewitness accounts describe some sore of eel, which if living in open water can grow very big,” said Mr Maynard. Mr Noblett is swimming across the English Channel in mid October. He hopes to raise £10,000 for Richard Rose Central Academy in Carlisle and the Cyctic Fibros is Trust.

By contrast, white Protestant liberals feel guilty about themselves. This leaves them without a confident group selfhood. They believe only in equality, only in their own guilt for somehow standing in the way of equality. It is this lack of collective and even individual selfhood, this inner nothingness, this willingness to be destroyed, that makes the white Protestants the true liberals. The Jews, whose collective and individual psyche is not guilty under liberalism (since in the liberal world view Jews are victims and the champions of victims), have psychological power and self-confidence and thus are not true liberals.
My spiritual practice revolves around the chanting of the maha-mantra, which is part of the Bhakti (devotional) path of Hinduism. The mantra features three names of the Divine, of God, as known in the Bhakti tradition: Krishna (the masculine aspect of the Divine), Hare (the feminine aspect of the Divine), and Rama (the pleasure reservoir of the Divine). The whole mantra goes like this:

Anything paranormal feels comfortable to me. I like to build my own world and write characters with abilities and skills that don’t occur in nature (well, at least, our nature). I have written stories that aren’t paranormal and I may write more in the future, but they’re not my favorite kind of story to tell. I like the creativity that paranormal romance allows me to express.
For the first 7 years of her life, I watched Katie grow up from an observer's point of view - seeing her often, getting to know her the way one gets to know a good friend's child, watching the friendship develop between her and Laura, and hoping it would blossom into the same kind of friendship Jill and I always had. And now for the past 4 years, I've been able to watch her grow up through the eyes of an adoptive parent. The little girl we used to babysit is now our daughter. And her best friend Laura is now her sister, and they'll always be there for each other. Looking back, it's hard to imagine that it wasn't always this way.
The general point is that rail transportation is expensive to build. But it often can drastically increase the value of station-proximate land. It’s important to use that land for its most valuable purpose. That will likely include parking in most cases, but reserving the land exclusively for parking is the real sell-out to private interests.

From the Eagle: "In the first half of 2008 (through June 19), 311 received 3,248 complaints about bedbug infestations from Brooklyn residents. Ominously, most people never bother to call 311 to complain about the bugs, so these figures probably represent just a fraction of the bedbugs out there."

My post, really, begins in the bus journey. The bus was full of River supporters, fully armed with drums, djambes and lots of chants. And they were singing their hearts out, while in the bus. One thing that I noticed was that throughout their chants, the drummer did exquisite changes in rhythm. Time, half-time, contra-time (transpié), back to time, pause and again... After a few weeks of classes with the Disparis I got a bit neurotic about rhythm of tracks so this was a complete revelation to me.

To be a bit more particular, I’ve learned that my decorating style is called “modern vintage.” What does this mean? It means I like the main furniture pieces in my home to be modern, with clean lines. But it also means I like bursts of color and accent pieces that are vintage or retro. So how would this come together? Well, maybe you’d have a nice sleek side table with a cool vintage lamp. Or maybe a shelf that highlights an old camera or collection of vintage books. I love the idea of vintage linens, a collection of mismatched old mugs, an antique quilt on a modern bed frame.

The contrary hypothesis that is defended by the Applicants, that the third Applicant is still alive, must be taken into account, and if it is verified, then her life and her wellbeing may depend on the search for her whereabouts, and these rights of her must also make those of the Defendants cede.

Corn Resin. The shelf life of corn resin is similar to synthetic plastics. It will not break down during regular wear and use. In a composite environment, corn resin is 99% biodegradable to carbon dioxide and water within 365 days. Since it’s made from corn, it comes from a renewable resource. Conventional plastics use an estimated 200,000 barrels of oil a day in the United States alone but because corn resin is bio-based, it therefore uses no oil resources in production

And the Obamas paid for the micro-brewing equipment, the aide noted, so there's no impact on the national debt.
I mean this literally, if someone had handed me nun papers, it woulda been a done deal. I'd be wearing a wimple. (Well, let's be honest. Me? EVIL! And REALLY bad at chastity. And humility. And isn't there something about poverty? Eww. So I would been kicked out by now, but still, they would have gotten at least a few months of fervent nun-ness out of me. I am nothing if not enthusiastic.)
My only issue at work is that in the workout room, all the equipment faces a wall of mirrors. There is no TV or anything else either, so you are just going along watching yourself... I have no desire to watch myself on the treadmill, all sweaty and red faced, breathing hard, and hair sticking up like The Bride of Frankenstein, it just is not pretty. To overcome this, I pick the treadmill closest to the door, the door partially blocks the mirror, so I only see half the sweaty mess!

I have been doing a lot of painting lately, hence the lighter than usual blog posts. I have also spent an unreasonable amount of time trying to photograph my paintings. I am starting to hate my light hungry camera. In the photo above you can't even tell that there is a small amount of gold leaf and the grays vary far more than the photo shows.
Jodi is busy cleaning up vomit and poop from Pukefest 2010. That's what she gets for trying to send her toddler to an hour of fun and engaging activities at Gymboree class.
Now any diet-conscious cyclist would admonish my attitude: to maintain a healthy weight, do not reward yourself by eating calorie laden food. True. The reality is at least a snack at the market, is a fabulous carrot stick motivator for me. I food shop at markets and often slug along back home with my 10-20 lbs. of food in my bulging bike panniers.

Why are you looking for moveable days in the calendar?’
And from heaven, Christ also rules as the fulfillment of the Messianic promise of Ps. 110:1. Not only is no one else sovereign, but every nation and every individual that rebels against Christ merely serves as a footstool for Christ. He places His feet on them and they are in every way in subjection to Him.

When I spotted a glimpse of this wedding on photographer Patricia Kantzos' blog, I immediately messaged her asking to see more and when she sent over the gorgeous details, I just couldn't wait to share them with all of you! Every detail is delish and the photos seem to balance a solid dose of romance with well-placed energetic punches of color ... the perfect mix for a day all about love and excitement.
(New York, NY)— On January 31, 2012, Susan G. Komen for the Cure, the nation’s largest breast cancer charity, announced they would halt 17 of their 19 partnerships with Planned Parenthood Federation of America affiliates, abruptly ending thousands of dollars in grant funding that went primarily towards breast examinations.

Komen Foundation reversed this controversial decision in response to sharp criticism from public health advocates, elected officials, and women’s interest groups nationwide; as well as the threatened resignation of some of the organization’s top officials.
I am at a loss for words today, so I'd like to allow some truly profound and remarkable people speak on my behalf:
Even if you can’t do it, do it until you can. There must be a way!

Finally, a section of glossary and internet resources is offered.

~ Despite this, there was the occasional scruffy-looking oddball.* I found it refreshing, and my favorite attendee was a guy in a tie-dyed t-shirt emblazoned with the National Bohemian mascot. I'm not certain this guy actually knew where he was, but he seemed to be having a good time.

Jenna had retained legal council in both Canada and the US, and was planning to hold a press conference tomorrow. Do you think that had something to do with it?? That, and the worldwide visibility that this has received. Now THAT was amazing. This kind of stuff happens all the time, but it's typically glossed over or hidden so it never gets that kind of momentum.
everything in our lives except ourselves.
Now I just need to put this rule to the test. If anyone else uses this house rule in solo or group play, let me know how it works for you.
