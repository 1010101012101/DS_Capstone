Far from being a reasoned or venerable system created by the Founders, as Ben implies, it was a last-minute addition that has never worked well. At the 1787 Constitutional Convention, some delegates wanted direct election of the president; others wanted indirect election by Congress. Near the end, under the "hurrying influence produced by fatigue and impatience," wrote James Madison, they settled on the Electoral College.

Jurors in the federal criminal trial of John Edwards were clearly not given a primer on the intricacies of the campaign finance laws he is accused of violating.

"People ask me that all the time: 'How do you fight somebody you know and are friends with?' I get more pumped up when I fight somebody I'm close to. It's competitiveness, that's what it is. ...

It's true that Social Security isn't the biggest contributor to the deficit. For the next decade, in fact, it's relatively small potatoes. The federal health care programs, Medicare and Medicaid, are in much worse shape financially.
"One destroyed jobs to put money in the pockets of millionaires through his hedge fund," Wisniewski said in an e-mail Saturday. "In an effort to tell Republican primary voters what they want to hear, he’s now turning his back on his own track record as governor.

The violin is captivating, especially for the wanderer. Writer Edmond de Goncourt tells us, “A poet puts up a ladder to a star and climbs it while playing the violin.”
Waititi skillfully evokes the malleable logic of childhood, and James Rolleston, as Boy, is a charmer all the way, with an easy expressiveness. Rocky, who we also get to know a bit, is a harder study. Burdened with the guilt of his mother's death, Rocky is withdrawn, but also less desperately in need of a father who will be a hero and a buddy. As Alamein, Waititi is likable enough to make Boy's partiality believable, and he's good at evincing a man of limited intelligence and patience dealing with kids who already have more basic sense than he does.

In nearly all cases, the authority retained all parking revenues, and usually concession revenues as well—but not always. An addendum to a Ringling Brothers contract with the sports authority from 2007, which extends to circus and ice shows through 2012, for example, gives Ringling sole and exclusive right to sell Sno-Cones, cotton candy, popcorn and s’mores.

So how is this happening? The pitching has been very good, from the starting rotation to the bullpen. Jake Peavy appears intent on doing more than talking this season. Chris Sale and Gavin Floyd have been solid. Opponents came into the game hitting .215 against Sox pitchers, the fifth-lowest average in the majors. Sale didn't have a great game Sunday, throwing 102 pitches over five-plus innings, but even then he gave up only five hits and three runs.
Jessich, 57, has been battling for 20 months to take control of her life from Joseph Vogel, a professional guardian and conservator appointed by a Hennepin County judge in December 2008 to make decisions for her. Last year, Jessich made major strides to overcome the eating disorder, neurological problems and alcoholism that had made her a ward of the court. But Vogel would not let her leave a Robbinsdale nursing home and rejoin her daughter Allison, who was left to fend for herself.
On the eve of the film's debut, Aksoy said he couldn't sleep and couldn't eat. One calculated risk was that he had no big-name Turkish actors in the movie, because he sensed stars would not be believable in the Ottoman setting. So he waited in a darkened theater to see the reaction of the audience to his movie, which was shot in 21 weeks over a three-year period. Then came the cheers and the throngs of viewers rushing to the theaters in Turkey, Europe and, in limited distribution, the United States.

Santorum also had a good Super Tuesday, spiced by victories in Tennessee and Oklahoma and a surprise win in North Dakota. But it could have been great, resetting the race, had he gotten just a few thousand more votes in Ohio.
Nearby, Apple workers were handing out Starbucks coffee and pastries to the dozens in line.
The reason? Stressful events cause you to release the "high-anxiety hormone" cortisol, and that triggers industrial-strength cravings for high-calorie munchies. The only way to fight it is to block the stress.

Behrndt provided a big spark for the Lancers early in Game 1 with some big blocks and kills. The first contest was close throughout. Lafayette looked like it was taking charge when it surged to a 22-19 lead. However, after a timeout by Carmel, the Greyhounds quickly tied the game 22-all.

Some activists said Monday that the new plan isn't enough.
Smith: Most tangibly, the relationship is 68 percent. I think the one area where the current mayor has been very strong and committed is with the arts. And the City of Portland is contributing, I think, about 68 percent to the overall RACC budget, which makes us (Portland) the single largest shareholder. I think going forward I will do what I can to work with regional partners, but not to lower Portland's contribution but to increase the contribution of other regional partners. To make sure the "R" in RACC is truly regional.

Miller, a member of the Mormon Church, invested in a 2001 Mormon-themed production called "Brigham City" that didn't crack the $1-million mark at the box office. Three years later, he put more than $7 million into another Mormon-themed production, "The Work and the Glory," which grossed $3.3 million. Though the film did well enough to spawn two sequels, Miller told the Salt Lake City Tribune in 2006 that the overall lack of success "extinguished" his interest in film production.

Billy Busch continued to live with his father at Grant's Farm, the family estate in South County, and the French Renaissance-style mansion there that always was kept apart from the animal park's visitors.

As someone who very much misses Ginza Sushiko, the legendary sushi bar in Beverly Hills, I was thrilled that Masa Takayama was opening Bar Masa at CityCenter. In a soaring space the size of an airplane hangar, Takayama presents sublime sushi, and in the adjacent Shaboo, set-price shabu-shabu meals at $500 per person. For me, Masa is one of the country's greatest chefs. But Bar Masa is by no means Ginza Sushiko, and it isn't supposed to be. The a la carte menu is pretty standard sushi fare, albeit with seafood flown in daily from Tokyo's Tsukiji market.

“Ali Houshmand (Rowan’s interim president) has talked partnership from the beginning,” said Sweeney. “What it will look like at the end, I don’t know. But is it OK for New Brunswick to short Camden $60 million every year? They’re being shortchanged. They really only contributed $14 million to Rutgers-Camden’s capital expenses. Rutgers canceled the dorm project. We got it back on track. If there’s a structure that stays, Rutgers-Camden has to have its own line items and independence.”

Men's Health magazine, for instance, named Denver the most "sloshed" big city in America last year, cheerily citing data that included alcohol-related deaths, arrests and accidents.

(On how he thinks Shurmur has handled his five games and if he remembers when he was a first-time head coach if there was ever this much scrutiny)- "Well my first seven games I was 2-5 in Green Bay, that I do remember. One of those wins was just a miracle so it could've been 1-6. I think if you're in this business and you become a head coach it shouldn't surprise you or shock you that you're going to be scrutinized and every little thing is going to be looked at. I think Pat's doing a great job, I really do. I think he communicates well with the players. He's kind of weathered, in my opinion pretty well, this storm cloud that's kind of hit the team early. He didn't have an offseason like I did. I was able to work with and establish some things before we came to training camp when I was a rookie head coach. The players are listening I can tell, I can see. We met on Tuesday, we meet every week and we had a pretty good session on Tuesday. We both kind of vented a little bit and it was real healthy. I really like him a lot. I told him two things, when you're the signal caller, as I was all those years, one of the first things I would every Monday morning was I would come in and I wasn't one of those guys that would look at the game Sunday night. We played the game, I was shot, and I'd wait until Monday. You come in and you look at every call you made, every call if you lost a football game I particular. Could that have been better? Would I have done something different? Did I do the right thing here? You kind of go through that and you're very hard on yourself because calling the game is very, very important. It's important that if you did, in your opinion, make an error or it's reasonable that you correct it, that's why you do that. It's a self-study. I also told him, don't beat himself up so much. Heck, it's football, you know you're a good coach, stuff happens, you're doing the best you can and you've got another game next week. That was my counsel to him on Tuesday. He's doing fine. We're the type of team that will probably be in a lot of close games this year. That's my feeling and certainly you could look at the Oakland game and the Cincinnati game, you could, and say shoot well if this could have gone here, you can do that. But, you lost so it's hard and I think that's what he's going through right now. I'll tell you what, he's a solid guy. I believe in him 100%. I'm not aware and I've told you, as much as I like all of you, I don't read you that much. I'm not aware of the criticism's that much and I don't really care, it's just important that he and I understand one another."
That's a battle that's been going on across America since the early 19th Century, he said.
Anyway. There's one major deviation in "Safe House" from the "Bourne" template: The filmmakers team the rogue-superspy character with someone who's hunting him. That someone is Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), a bored CIA "housekeeper" who's manned a South African "safe house" for a year and desperately wants a transfer to Paris so he can follow his girlfriend (Nora Arnezeder).
I had an urgent piece of mail to get to the post office. My sister called the postmistress, who agreed to stay open for her to deliver it.

As a result, brands will be very cautious in 2012. Manufacturers will attempt to control new shipments into the U.S. market, so that prices remain steady.
Defined as: Having or showing an excessive pride in oneself or achievements. I stress here the word "excessive." I find this quality in purveyors of virtue on both sides of the political spectrum but it usually lands on me as myopic, uninformed or not caring. I find the titles of Frank's Salon column somewhat smug as in: 'Did you leave the IRS a tip on Tax Day?' I guess that's a comment on liberal smugness — generous tipping? Having worked for tips in my life I know how meaningful a generous tip can be. If not deserved, don't leave it. But now on to the rest of the uninformed views of Tea Party politics.

Shortly after he was elected, Hawkins named himself fire director, even though he has no firefighting experience. The move inflated his part-time mayor’s salary of $25,000 per year, landing Hawkins a six-figure annual income. He later dropped the title and $76,000 salary under mounting criticism.

Obama does propose curbs on Medicare and Medicaid spending, but his budget would largely preserve the programs. This is in contrast to Ryan's idea last week to convert Medicare into a voucher program and Medicaid into block grants. (Washington Post) Liberal and conservative health-policy specialists alike questioned whether it is possible to clamp down significantly on (Medicare's) spending without broader changes in the way health care is paid for and delivered. "Really tight controls mean lots of changes one way or another," said Marilyn Moon, who directs health programs at the American Institutes of Research and is a former public trustee of the Medicare and Social Security programs. Gail Wilensky, a senior fellow at Project Hope who ran Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said, "If we don't redesign what we are doing, we can't just cut unit reimbursement and think we are somehow going to get a better system."

So how much money has the inspector general recovered? $0. Why? We'll let you guess. And if your guess is that it's because there still is no inspector general and that the appointment remains gummed up in the City Council, you win. But of course, if you live in Los Angeles, you lose, too. To the tune of about half a billion dollars.

If your travel plans take you to Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand or the United Kingdom, then you should consider this before you leave your hotel, and definitely before you rent a car. In fact, about a third of the world's drivers go to the left, including motorists in many Caribbean and Pacific islands and parts of Africa. So there's a reasonably good chance that you'll someday have to drive on what, to you, is the wrong side of the road.

I could discard her baseless argument about the University of Virginia case and focus on her equally as egregious statements about lacrosse as a high pressure, privileged, wealthy sport.

"Part One: Millennium Approaches," which opened Thursday, captures the play's imposing dimensions, both physical and intellectual.

Fortunately, marriage equality supporters are beginning the referendum process in a strong position: A majority of Marylanders support committed gay and lesbian couples getting married. This includes 65 percent of Democrats under the age of 50. And younger voters, who overwhelmingly favor marriage equality, are expected to turn out in droves for President Barack Obama. They understand it's only fair that Prince George's County Police Officer Irene Huskens, who served her country in the U.S. Air Force, wants the opportunity to marry. They get that Steve Reilly of Annapolis wants his mom to marry her partner of 18 years just as he was able to marry his wife. They empathize with Penny Nichols of Bowie who proudly told lawmakers she was "taking a stand as a strong, steadfast, straight mother" of a lesbian daughter.

Webb's desire to connect with people, however, would feel like little more than a footnote with fans if he hadn't blossomed into one of the best cornerbacks in football this year. Name a statistical category and he's already left his mark. He leads the team with four interceptions; he's third on the team in tackles with 55 (trailing only Ray Lewis and Jameel McClain); and he's had a sack, a forced fumble and a defensive touchdown. In the Ravens' Thanksgiving win over the San Francisco 49ers, he made one of the biggest plays of the game, making an interception just before halftime, never losing focus, even though receiver Braylon Edwards was yanking on his dreadlocks as he caught the ball. Barely a week goes by that one of Webb's teammates doesn't lobby for him to make the Pro Bowl.

For years, Palm's Thai restaurant (5900 Hollywood Blvd.) has had a not-so-secret weapon: Kavee Thongpreecha, better known as Thai Elvis, who serenaded diners with the King's hits while they dug into boar, deep-fried frog, fish maw salad and more conventional Thai dishes. Lately, Thai Elvis has been sidelined by poor health, but Palm's Thai is still an emblematic L.A. experience. Because it's in eastern Hollywood (where Thai Town and Little Armenia rub shoulders), odds are that a young Armenian valet will take your car as a Thai hostess welcomes you. While diners fill the long line of tables in the big, airy dining room, pop performers typically do half-hour sets at 7:30, 9 and 10 p.m. daily. But you may move on sooner. Drawing on the many aspiring actors in town, the Hudson Theatres (6539 Santa Monica Blvd.) and several other venues have grown to make up a Hollywood Theater Row along Santa Monica between La Brea Boulevard and El Centro Street. Most have 99 or fewer seats and ticket prices less than $30. The work can be outstanding, and that ought to be enough to fill your night. But some people want an edgier, only-in-L.A. sort of adventure. For them, there's Jumbo's Clown Room (5153 Hollywood Blvd.), a smallish, strip-mall, retro-burlesque joint that features pole-dancers who keep on their bikinis and whose ages and shapes vary considerably. Two matronly women pour the drinks. The bouncer looks like just another 163-pound unproduced screenwriter, and sometimes the drinkers are so happy chatting that the dancers seem an afterthought. What does it all mean? This much is sure: There's no cover charge, tipping is encouraged and there's a two-drink minimum.

You remember how that last trip to, say, Puerto Vallarta, you noticed all these weathered concrete stubs, complete with rebar sticking out — construction projects at a dead halt, due to lack of funding?

How they'll do in the U.S. is "a step in the dark," said Pieter de Waal, vice president of BMW Motorrad USA. Scooters aren't nearly as commonplace in the U.S. as they are in Europe, and their sales are correlated with gas prices. Its buyers aren't expected to be motorcyclists, nor are they likely to be owners of BMW cars.

Moore's credentials are top notch, having become the first four-time first team All-American in the history of the college basketball with the UConn Huskies. In April she was named as the 2011 Naismith College Women's Player of the Year, the second time she'd achieved the award. Her teams won two national titles and set an NCAA record 90 consecutive victories.

He's missed in Eugene - after the spring game, defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti was still talking about how he hopes the back end of his unit comes together. And he might find a home in Houston, where the depth behind starters Danieal Manning and Glover Quin is filled in part by someone who was on the street at the beginning of last season (Quintin Demps) and a fifth-round pick in the 2011 draft who was overwhelmed when on the field (Shiloh Keo).

That made no sense at all. Health care is filled with abuse. People get unnecessary surgeries and unnecessary tests all the time. Doctors and patients are in cahoots on this. Patients want more of this and more of that, and the doctors are paid by the procedure. Abuse is rampant.

The second-seeded Russian found herself a big winner today, more than just as a result of her second-round, three-set victory against Kateryna Bondarenko. After Venus Williams withdrew, it meant last year’s runner-up now had a much easier path out of her bracket.
Sometimes it feels as if I'm answering questions you haven't asked, but I've heard too many people say over the years that they don't need newspapers because they get their news from the Internet or TV or radio.
All the paperwork means delays into Ulan Ude, the former "closed city" in Siberia that was once a linchpin in Cold War weapons production. In the bad old days, it was strictly off-limits to foreigners like us. Now, the factories lie silent and smashed, their workers gone. It's hot again, much to the disappointment of the group. The streets of the city of 400,000 are filled with cottonwood fluff falling down from the trees.
To live for a few days in complete solitude would be a nightmare for many people, but again, based on personality, it is my dream. Much of my time has been spent hectically juggling competing business and community obligations. The simplicity and slow pace at the Abbaye brings perspective to all this.

“There are a lot of folks that said Tim Tebow wasn't going to be a very good NFL quarterback. There are people that stood up and said, 'Well, he doesn't have the right throwing mechanisms, or he's not playing the game right,' " Perry said. “And he won two national championships, and that looked pretty good. We were the national champions in job creation back in Texas. And so, am I ready for the next level? Let me tell you, I hope I am the Tim Tebow of the Iowa caucuses.”
"I told myself I was doing what I should have done when I first went away to school - dating and sleeping with whomever I wanted, instead of being faithful. But I did have a somewhat devil-may-care attitude as to whether or not the girls had boyfriends back home, which I'm sure was out of spite over my girlfriend cheating on me."
For Hall, only a complete rethinking of public pensions can save the city's financial future. New city workers should pay more into their revised pension plans and likely get lower guaranteed payments when they retire.

Romney, speaking at Otterbein University, a small college in suburban Columbus, said the president has embraced big government, higher taxes and wrapped business start-ups in red tape, a troubling concoction that has stifled job creation in this country. He said the president may have meant well at first but somewhere along the way lost focus.
String Quartet No. 2 features a high-octane opening, with repeated slashing motives before the music lands on a deep, sober note. This pattern bookends the first movement and sets the tone for the emphatic and anxious qualities that pervade the work. A sparser middle movement sometimes recalls Arvo Pärt and builds to a cathartic summit before edging its way sadly down.
I realize they don't hand out trophies in mid-season but a win tonight would have great symbolic value for the Blues. This franchise has gone through a lot over the last 5-6 years. Some of the negativity has been self-inflicted and some was shoved in their faces by the way the previous ownership group gutted the team prior to selling it. To move into the top spot in the Western Conference would be a form of validation. It would show that the plan the current management team has followed is working.
The Padres also recalled infielder James Darnell from Triple-A Tucson before Friday night's game at Philadelphia. The 25-year-old Darnell hit .267 with 21 RBIs in 31 games at Tucson this season.

Shurmur: "We factored that in, when we evaluated him as a receiver. You can see enough, obviously there is enough throwing going on in college football where you can see what a receiver is going to bring to the table. He did some things that were very impressive to us. He can really run and when he gets down the field he can really track the ball, which I think is one of his real strong suits and that is a good thing."

When Djokovic ended it with a forehand winner, he raised his arms, then tossed aside his racket and dropped to the court. He pulled off his shirt and threw it into the stands, then put on a dark hat with "FDNY" written on it - a nod to Sunday's 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which both he and Nadal mentioned during the trophy ceremony.

Will it last, who knows? But for one game it had to be nice to play and not suffer. The Indians have played 47 one-run games, third most in the AL. That's a lot of games with the outcome hanging by one pitch, one swing or one catch. Tuesday night, manager Manny Acta could at least keep most of his bullpen arms at rest.
"Rebirth of a Nation: The Making of Modern America, 1877-1920" is Lears' most ambitious work yet, and it builds brilliantly on those earlier projects. The Rutgers University professor makes a convincing case that the transformations America underwent in the half century's journey from out of the "long shadow of Appomattox" and into the terrible flare-lit night of the European trenches remains fundamental to our understanding of ourselves -- and to the conduct of our affairs.

Why it's hot: In a world of ounces, pints and even yards of beers, the Dubliner stands apart with its Liter Nights. The South Tampa Irish pub serves liters of draft beer for $6 every Wednesday. Any kind goes, from Miller Lite to Guinness. And for those who slept through the metric lesson in school, that's a very good deal. One liter equals 33.8 ounces, or nearly three bottles of beer. Just don't nurse it or it will get warm, and everyone knows that chugging hot beer isn't fun.

The transition from outfielder-first baseman to analyst came quickly for Duncan. He went to spring training with hopes of winning a spot with Milwaukee or elsewhere, but lingering hip and neck ailments led him to failing a physical examination. Last offseason Duncan had been contacted by then-WXOS program director Jason Barrett about doing some work for the station, so when it became evident that he wasn't going to play this year he called Barrett and a deal was made. Barrett since has left the market, one in which Duncan now has made a mark, and Dave Duncan said there is nothing wrong with an educated analysis.
At Monday’s meeting, Harris and the council discussed everything from the Girl Scouts’ 100th anniversary to a new rain garden at a local park and installing a temporary path for students walking to school.

Also keep in mind whether the heirs would be subject to state estate tax, which may have a lower threshold than federal estate tax, she says. If the state where the property is located has a low asset threshold for state estate tax, and you live in a different state, having the property held in an LLC with more than one member could help shield you from that tax, Ms. Christerson says.

Local passions run high about the cougar killed by California Fish & Game President Dan Richards. The rancher said the three cougars were on his property and presented a threat, so they were killed as a "favor." But cougars are solitary animals that require huge individual territories, larger than the 14,000 acre ranch. The only way three cougars could have been there on one day in the middle of winter would be if baits had been set to attract the hungry cats. Fresh meat, probably deer, had been placed in food caches on the ranch and regularly, to entice these animals to visit. Once there they were tracked in the snow and killed. Except for the big cats themselves there was nothing innocent or natural about it. Had I not attended last week's Friends of San Pedro Valley Park biology lecture at the visitor center I wouldn't have seen the lie in the newspaper story.
So I headed east and exited the freeway and wound up on a Cleveland street named Triskett. I stopped at a gas station to buy a map.

Dessert: Passover cakes and/or cookies require no additional preparation and are the perfect ending to the meal. There's really no fruit in season yet, but you can perk up some West Coast (or imported) strawberries by hulling them, cutting into halves or quarters (depending on the size) and tossing them with a spoonful of sugar and a few drops of balsamic vinegar a few hours before you plan to serve. Refrigerate until it's time for dessert.
It's nearly a seamless fit. Only one part of the second-floor landing had to be modified to allow the cab door to open. Otherwise, the Visilift, as it is called, slid into place like a giant straw. Neither the floor nor the ceiling needed adapting -- save for some unseen shoring of the main floor -- which made the decision that much easier for the Showmans.

In the end, none of the requests received funding, according to the Minnesota Department of Transportation.

The actors are understated, but when the script calls for a thunderous scene, they are up to the challenge. Cyril is a powder keg of misplaced shame and suppressed rage, yearning for his runaway dad; Doret is flawlessly natural in the role. De France, a slightly careworn beauty with the eyes of a Madonna, is luminous as the surrogate mother whose compassion might alter the course of a lost boy's life.

The Nittany Lions went on the road and won at Ohio State last week. They go to Wisconsin this week, and the winner gets the title in the Big Ten's Leaders Division and a spot in the conference's inaugural title game.

Christie’s words echoed a theme of "Waiting for 'Superman,'" which takes aim at teachers unions and public school bureaucracy as drags on student progress. The movie, which opened last fall, questions prevailing beliefs that urban schools are mired by their neighborhoods’ poverty and crime. Film director Davis Guggenheim suggests the opposite, stating in the film that some believe "problems of failing neighborhoods might be blamed on failing schools."
The match binds two St. Louisans of popular lineage, given the celebrity of Humphrey's, which has been the favorite watering hole for St. Louis University students and staff since it opened in 1976, and Shortal's ancestry.

At first blush, Mourdock seems an unlikely dragon slayer. A two-term state treasurer, he lacks the dashing presence of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and the fiery rhetoric of tea-party standard-bearers like Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh and Florida Rep. Allen West. Before his 2006 election as state treasurer, an office that carries little name recognition, Mourdock's only political experience consisted of two terms as a commissioner in the southern Indiana county that includes Evansville.

McCormick said the state university tried to book the author of "Beloved" and "Song of Solomon" to speak at graduation for years, without success.

When he determined it had no value, he abandoned the idea.

The better-groomed the characters, the more morally dubious they are. We're talking about the Titanic, remember, and how it perished after hitting an iceberg on its maiden voyage. A number of rich people are traveling on this behemoth, including Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon and his wife, Lucile. She's the most famous dress designer in the world, but some upstart named Chanel is out there snipping her scissors with murderous intent. Lucile is still trapped in overly elegant gowns made of satin and chiffon, each one graced with a dreamy and pretentious name such as "Sighing Sound of Lips Unsatisfied" or "Frenzied Song of Amorous Things."

NPR Earlier this month, conservative activist James O'Keefe orchestrated a luncheon meeting between two NPR executives and some men pretending to be representatives of a group affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood that supposedly was willing to donate $5 million to the network. The conversation was secretly taped, revealing that the NPR executives called the Tea Party a group of racists and generally agreed with other damning comments made by the "Muslims." Both execs lost their jobs. Another, CEO Vivian Schiller, resigned. And a congressional effort to strip federal funding from public broadcasting was strengthened.

It's not that the ideological case against Obama cannot be made. Obamacare with its individual mandate remains unpopular. The near-trillion-dollar stimulus remains an albatross. Even the failed attempt at cap-and-trade -- government control of energy pricing -- shows Obama's determination to fundamentally transform America. And he is sure to try again to complete his coveted European-style social-democratic project if you give him four more years.
Kaptur's statement was partially accurate. Kucinich did vote against the legislation containing funding earmarked for 19 projects in Ohio. Kaptur sponsored, or co-sponsored, those earmarks. But there are important details missing from the claim.

One option was to raise the debt ceiling by $1 trillion and cut spending by a little more than that, a short-term deal that would necessitate a second vote on the issue before the 2012 elections.
He was talking about the Titanic, of course. Although this Halifax cemetery lies about 750 miles northwest of the waters where that celebrated ship went down April 15, 1912, it was the seamen of Halifax who retrieved more than 300 of the dead, along with a grim harvest of flotsam.

Most missteps were on my first visit, so it gives me hope that Nick's won't succumb to the tourist-view virus that compromises most restaurants along the coast.

Some movies lend themselves to reviewing, and some don't. Last week's "Lockout" was a straightforward flick to write up. "The Cabin in the Woods" is anything but it has a very specific, narrow audience and you're either in it or you're not. If you are, you probably know it already and saw the flick the day it opened. If you aren't, then you don't really need me to tell you to avoid it.

She was a child star who grew up and aged before an adoring, appalled and fascinated public. She arrived in Hollywood when the studio system tightly controlled an actor's life and image, had more marriages than any publicist could explain away and lasted long enough to no longer require explanation. She was the industry's great survivor, and among the first to reach that special category of celebrity -- famous for being famous, for whom her work was inseparable from the gossip around it.

CKE has about 720 California restaurants, in which 84 percent of the managers are minorities, and 67 percent are women. CKE has, however, all but stopped building restaurants in this state because approvals and permits for establishing them can take up to two years, compared to as little as six weeks in Texas, and the cost to build one is $100,000 more than in Texas, where CKE is planning to open 300 new restaurants this decade.

White Eagle Memorial Preserve: About a 2 1/2 hour drive from Portland, the conservation burial area near Goldendale, Wash., offers 20-by-20-foot gravesites for $2,200. The plots are large so the staff can site the grave in an environmentally sensitive way -- away from tree roots, for example. GPS is used to keep track of the plots; simple markers of native materials with names engraved are optional, but the nine burials there so far have not chosen to use them. About 30 plots have been sold so far, with room for 1,000 or more. Simple shrouds and pine caskets, built from trees felled and milled on the nearby ranch that's part of the same land trust, are available. www.naturalburialground.com

Each and every lock of his long, tightly-curled hair has to be pulled apart, Levy explained. The large white cords, which add an extra 10 pounds to Ben's weight, also take hours to wash and several days to dry, and multiple driers are needed at the same time in order to get the job done. Still, Ben -- whose hair was held back from his face by several pony-tail holders -- seemed to appreciate the hard work put in by his owner, as he sat happily by her side.

Felt's moment in history began to unfold shortly after five men in business suits were arrested at the Watergate complex in Washington on June 17, 1972, after breaking into the offices of the Democratic National Committee. Nixon Press Secretary Ron Ziegler dismissed the incident as "a third-rate burglary," but details gradually tumbled out tying the burglars to the president's reelection campaign. Misdeeds in the White House were uncovered, hearings were conducted in the House of Representatives and the Senate, and for the first time in American history a president was forced to resign.

Suu Kyi's rise to public office marks a reversal of circumstance for a woman who became one of the world's most prominent prisoners of conscience, held under house arrest for much of the last two decades.

Gray ("Swimming to Cambodia") was carving out a career as the world's most self-obsessed Protestant, director Steven Soderbergh ("Traffic") was by his side, recording his work in the monologue "Gray's Anatomy" and in the period drama "King of the Hill" (filmed in St. Louis). In January 2004, two and a half years after a painful car accident, Gray leapt from the Staten Island Ferry, capping a lifelong obsession with suicide.

The Riviera Maya is rife with chichi resort spas, but massages, wraps and manicures at the Jungle Spa are administered in simple buildings by Maya women who learned massage with their ABCs. Maya massage is intended not to pamper but to heal all manner of ailments, and the manipulation of internal body organs can be, well, uncomfortable for gringo bodies. Under the tutelage of Sandra Dayton, who has lived in Puerto Morelos for 17 years and founded the Lu'um K'aa Nab nonprofit to create ways for local women to earn a living, they have learned to incorporate other types of massage to work their magic vigorously but painlessly. And they charge about one-third of what hotel spas do.
Both types of cancers are rare: In the U.S., about 10,000 to 12,000 people develop a glioma each year and about 3,000 develop acoustic tumors. The elevated risk roughly doubles after a decade of cellphone use, according to some studies. But the number of cellphone users worldwide - about 5 billion - means a potential cancer link should be taken very seriously, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, chairman of the department of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California and the chairman of the panel that issued the report.

The modern-minded, insightful jazz guitarist Dave Stryker and his similarly disposed alto saxophone partner, Steve Slagle, offer, here, a fresh batch of alluring numbers. They’re played with snap and spirit by the leaders, plus bassist Jay Anderson and drummer Victor Lewis. Stryker’s “Keeper” boasts punchy riffs and flowing passages over a crisp, funk-tinged beat that becomes percolating swing. Lewis, Anderson and Stryker vigorously accompany Slagle’s hearty-toned, engaging remarks. Slagle plays Monk’s “Ruby My Dear” with panache and emotion. The horn man’s “Sister” features intriguing call-and-response lines; Stryker’s “Gold Dust” is a winsome bossa.

Cilantro's biryani rice dishes and Southern Indian crepes, called dosai, didn't cause me to dance any jigs, but they're workhorse. In general, the price-to-portion ratio seems fair-minded, the beer and wine list short but cheap. Service can add an element of surprise, sometimes efficient and friendly, sometimes absentee or zombielike. Even so, when you need a fix of spicy, comforting Indian classics, Cilantro is an herbal remedy.
The greens that come with these dishes are no after-thought, as they are fresh and delicate and drizzled with a lovely vinaigrette. And the bowl of complimentary soup is more pungent than most, floating with sliced green onions and redolent with cinnamon and allspice.

Economists caution that housing is a long way from fully recovering.

On the other side of the room, Team Navy was busy prepping its dishes. Thang had taped the recipes to the cabinets next to the two stoves and posted a production schedule on the refrigerator. Then she began commanding her troops like a Marine sergeant. For some reason, we had thought she'd be the shy one.
