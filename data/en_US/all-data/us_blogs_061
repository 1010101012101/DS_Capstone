With Double Indemnity, this is the film that best seems to exemplify what people imagine when they think of Film Noir. It has a doomed hero who by the end seemed to not so much welcome as invite his end, a femme fatale as its protagonist, a complex crime plot, shimmering and moody cinematography, a strong sense of character and places in which people pay for playing outside of societal’s accepted boundaries – and lots of double crosses and dead bodies. Jane Greer, Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas make for a great triumvirate in another dark romantic triangle that ends in death and destruction. And its all filmed with the greatest possible taste with exquisite flair by Jacques Tourner, here simultaneously making the transition to the big time and peaking in a career that already included Cat People and I Walked with a Zombie for the Val Lewton unit. Subsequently remade asAgainst All Odds (1984). Classic private eye noir movie. From the novel ‘Build My Gallows High’ by Geoffrey Homes (aka Daniel Mainwaring).

So it is with great sadness that I now report the sale price of builder Damien Kaali Nagy’s spec house at 11 Pinecrest Road at $4,970,000. As I guessed a couple of weeks ago, this represents over a one million dollar increase from the previous record for the street. That’s good news for normal people, bad news for…the others.
So another crappy day dawned. I had called around at some RTC centers looking/checking out….weighing options…at this point it was about everyone in my home feeling safe…and I wanted a plan B in place, for when not IF a bomb got detonated yet again.

I had never before entertained the notion of checking for cats before purchasing a tree. I do not know if she had been hiding in there since the tree was cut, journeying via 18 wheeler all the way to the tree lot or if she was already on the lot, thus seeking shelter in the tree.
This was a lot of fun to make and I’m looking forward to collecting some more colors. Right now, all I have is blue, red, yellow and brown. They’re fairly expensive, so I’ve been using 40% and 50% off coupons to buy them one at a time from Michaels.

Conventions around dead people are ridiculous. The world outlook is slightly improved with @AndrewBrietbart dead The discussion of this subject is interesting where Breitbart is concerned, as he himself famously and publicly danced on the tomb of Sen. Teddy Kennedy when the latter passed away from cancer in 2009. Breitbart justified this on the grounds that Kennedy was a particularly noxious bad actor in US politics, deserving of special scorn.

A few years ago, I blogged about how some of my friends are connected to each other in bizarre, coincidental ways. I had a similar experience last night that made my head spin. I've written about how I met my husband, Monkeyrotica, through a personals ad, but not about why I was looking at personals ads in the first place. That's a tale that I was reminded of last night while I found myself face-to-face with the wife of my ex-boyfriend. Here's that story, from the very beginning.
"Emily, remember Christmas is not just a day but a feeling that is always in your heart. It is not just Christmas trees, presents and a big turkey dinner, but a feeling of love, forgiveness, family and remembering others who are not as fortunate as we are.
The causes will be widespread but will probably include wealth disparities, growing poverty, affirmative action and poor service delivery. Add to this the likely increasing loss of desperately needed skills as young professionals seek their fortunes in more stable societies and declining education standards on the back of ideological experimentation, increased crime on the back of poor policing, growing poverty, uncontrolled urbanisation and large numbers of Aids orphans.

Muck was Quoted saying in an interview with Ark Collective “I never planned to be an artist. I was actually not into art at all as a teenager, but I did do graffiti. Most of the time I used to go out and try to wreck murals and stuff, and put my name everywhere. Slowly, by doing it over and over again, my name got more and more intricate. Over time, this woman who is an artist in the Bronx took me on as her apprentice. I just did it because I wasn’t thinking, and I kind of became her right hand man. She showed me how to make money as an artist and make a living that way. Basically she gave me the confidence to do it since I never thought it was a possibility, and it worked out really well.”
The bloke laughs. "Noooo, you're not dead! I just brought you here to say hello. It's nice to be nice".

Go forth, go quick, and Lead the Way. For once you set free, you go beyond earth’s door. And awaiting are we, with more in store. So pray and leap in bounds and steps, for Heaven awaits with its pearly gates. Go hither, go yond, go forth in Peace. And find what you are looking for in one big piece. For the pieces are small, yet they all meld together. And that’s what I’m here for, to pray together. Go yond, go quick, my innocent child.

I’m trying to minimize the caffeine and sugar, take short naps, allow for mini-meditation breaks, lessen the need to “clear the day’s list,” and just sit and watch the willows dance.

In two games in Miami, the Heat have taken control in two very different contests. In the first game, Miami blew the Knicks away thanks to a focused LeBron and ridiculous defense to deny Melo the ball (great work by Shane Battier and LBJ). The second game played out in a whole new way: Melo played point forward to get him the ball and stagnated the entire rest of the team while finishing with 30 points (which do you think was more important to him, winning the game or dropping thirty? I go with the latter).
I played two games with these forces. First one solo at home in an “urban” setting, the other at the club in a more regular battlescape.

Back to some more kitchen love. And what's the main purpose of a kitchen? Cooking! And if you're not a paid professional chef, you may find yourself relying on recipes when it comes to whipping up a fab dinner. There are a lot of great ways to keep recipes organized, and as most organizing projects are, it's all about personal preference and finding what works best for you. Many individuals may find using recipe cards and boxes, their fav way to corral all their family favorites, while others, may choose to go a binder route, which is the path I choose.

The stamp is by Penny Black and is called 'A Hug Is...', I used a Rusty Brown Stazon inkpad to make the words standout. The flower is made using two different die sets, the Spellbinders Rose Creations and Marianne Ribbon Flower 1. The leaves are from Spellbinders Foliage set and the twirly bit is from the Doodle Parts set, the butterfly is also from Spellbinders. The card, paper, brad and jewels are all from my stash. I love the nice soft colours in this card, it appeals to me, and I really enjoyed making the flower.

Morning news television shows aimed for stay at home moms are one of my weaknesses. They are so entertaining and I love all the great advice they offer. My morning routine consists of The Today Show, Live with Kelly, and then The View. I never have enough time to watch all three in a row, but I make sure to catch at least part of one everyday- just to stay in touch.
My poor garden is just so sad this year, partly the weather but part of the problem in my garden this year is fertility. That is a lack of nutrients and compost. We ran out of time in the spring and didn't get much on and used strictly organic slow release fertilizer which would be great in addition to other amendments....

Micky loves to sit on my knee when I am on the bed.

She always tries to rip some flesh from my fingers. She is a completely different character and very strong.
Because, and this is part of the point, I, too, was stupid and with the large public outcry over the ending when I finished the game. The subtlety and nuance of the ending, which now seem so clear and obvious, did not dawn on me. Why? Because I saw that damn meme with Morpheus from The Matrix offering Neo the blue and red pill and Commander Shepard below, obviously distraught, saying, ‘What, no green?’
I also squeeze the tube from the part closest to the actual system and then to the end of the tube to draw out the formula so it is going out the BIG end of the tube, rather than making the bulb push all of the formula through the smaller tubing (see video). THEN I flush it all with soapy water.

Old Testament Reading: Deuteronomy 4:1,5-9
Thirdly, Samad's paper, and numerous other sources, claim that the fish was attracted to the victim by the scent of urine in the water. Now, it is true that fish excrete ammonia through their gills and the candiru's natural behaviour is to swim into the gill slits of fish and to attach themselves to the blood-rich tissues to feed. Ammonia and urea are dangerous to a fish's metabolism if allowed to build up in concentration inside the body. So urea is released in urine and ammonia is excreted through the gills. Therefore, it seems quite logical to assume that it is ammonia - present also in urine - that attracts the candiru to a possible host, fish or human. However, this was proven not to be the case in 2001 when experiments clearly showed that candiru identify potential hosts by sight, not smell, and have no specific ability to detect chemical attractants.
And we are all connected to it in some form or another.

UPDATE: 8th August, 2011. The Sunday Business Post reports on a meeting between justice minister Alan Shatter and commercial tenants from Grafton Street in Dublin. The report suggests that the legislation will be introduced in the autumn but that there are difficult Constitution-related obstacles to be overcome. Again the term “exceptional circumstances” has cropped up in the context of tenants seeking rent reductions, suggesting that tenants will face obstacles in seeking reductions.

During my prayers ,somehow I though of the tough years I had behind me. How even though my children had whatever they needed, however much that I love them…would I have not wanted a better life for them? Of course I would, but I did my best and I’m glad that I have had them. But yet, I could understand why a woman would give up her child if she herself had nothing to offer(think that she had nothing to offer). That too is motherly love, wanting the best for your child, even if it kills you inside.

Overall this was a decent conclusion to this series. The book is basically one giant battle between Klea and Avalon. Not as much romance as previous installments but the story does tie up nicely. Highly recommended for fans of this series. Also recommened for those who enjoy paranormal YA reads with a heavy element of faerie in them. This series isn't as excellent as The Iron Fey by Julie Kagawa....but it is still a fun read.

Meanwhile, Joseph was still quite sick. He was so uncomfortable and seemed to be in pain, but didn't want to be held much or touched. He just lay on his back tossing his head back and forth and whimpering softly. He had no energy to drink so every two hours I had to coax him to take some milk from the bottle and then slowly pour more into his mouth bit by bit.

The next round of QE will likely target Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS). They could potentially do nominal GDP targeting. This would be where they say they are targeting 3% nominal economic growth. Then take into account that inflation (in their eyes) is only 2%. If nominal growth is only 2% (with their fairy tale 2% CPI number) that means they need to print another 1% to get the nominal GDP to 3%. In real terms growth is zero but in nominal terms it would be 3%.
All aboard! So just in case you forgot a gift or two, there are women selling items to you through the windows of the train.

So what is this beer? They call it Bombay Blonde and the website is set up for the beer not the brewery. I don't like the name but the branding is certainly distinctive. It pours clear pale and well carbonated, a must to cleanse the rich sauces from the pallet, although the head disappears quickly. Quite subdued on the nose but really refreshing and fruity on the palate. Good strong bitterness should play well with the spicy food. I did not have it with a curry but it went down a treat as a post gym pre dinner thirst quencher, so perhaps not such a one dimensional beer.

Now, performance aside, there has been a certain concern raised about her “Complexity” – non comics folks, let me explain. There is a particular idiocy among a certain subset of comics readers that think cup size is inversely proportional to a complex and sophisticated portrayal of the character. A curvy and bouncy Catwoman that men enjoy looking at can’t possibly be a serious, realistic and complex treatment of the character, because of course, big breasted women don’t exist in nature. Fear not, fellas. What you saw in The Devil Wear’s Prada is creative costuming. Anne Hathaway is plenty lacking in complexity.

You can imagine that the relief felt by the slave would have been so great that he went out of that meeting with a spring in his step and a smile on his face, radiating goodwill to all as a result of his own good fortune. Sadly nothing could be further from the truth. His fellow slave owed him a mere 100 days’ wages, enough but not an impossible amount to repay. The scene so recently played out between the king and his slave is mirrored in that between slave and slave. The difference is that there was no forgiving of the debt. The debtor was thrown into jail until he paid up, but as he was not working there was very little chance of the debt ever being cleared.

The answer is, it depends on what insurance company you are insured with. Some companies have what is called “permissive use” included in their policy. This means if you give someone permission to drive your car, the coverage on your policy extends to that person. However, the way “permissive use” works is different between insurance companies. With some companies the coverage limits on your policy will remain the same even when someone else is driving your car. With other companies your coverage limits may be reduced to some limit lower than what you have on your policy. Here in California some companies reduce the limits to the state minimum limits. ﻿Other companies may deny coverage all together if someone other than the “named insured” is driving your car.

See, there are basically four aspects of my job: working well in a team setting, professionalism, knowledge of mental illness and addiction, and building rapport with clients.

Sixteen years have passed since a deadly virus wiped out most of the Earth’s population. After learning of the terrifying part she and her classmates were fated to play in the rebuilding of New America, eighteen-year-old Eve fled to the wilds and Califia, a haven for women determined to live outside the oppressive rule of the king of New America. However, her freedom came at a price: she was forced to leave Caleb, the boy she loves, wounded and alone at the city gates. Eve quickly learns that Califia may not be as safe as it seems and soon finds herself in the City of Sand and the palace of the king. There she uncovers the real reason he was so intent on her capture, and the unbelievable role he intends her to fill. When she is finally reunited with Caleb, they will enact a plan as daring as it is dangerous. But will Eve once again risk everything—her freedom, her life—for love?

How can the words “beer-battered wings” not catch your eye? Especially with the mention of fish in the first line which almost tricks your eye into thinking “beer-battered fish” instead. The poem itself makes me think of leaving the windows open on a nice day and hearing the birds, the sound of fish jumping in a river, the sounds distant. As for the beer-battered wings, I am not sure if she means that the birds seem inexplicably weighted down but I love the language of it. Again, I wonder what her inspiration was for this poem.

The United Arab Emirates officials are burning with a low blue flame. They have once again started insulting the Iranian nation using an arrogant and offensive language. What has irritated them this time is the recent visit paid by the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the Iranian island of Abu Musa in the Persian Gulf as part of his provincial trip to the southern province of Hormozgan on April 11. They claim that the island belongs to their soil and that Iran has violated their territorial integrity by continuing its "occupation" of the strategic island.
Lastly, there has been an idea put forward by my good friends, Tara Mack and Keith Catone, that there should be a national day of solidarity where teachers would teach our curriculum all over the nation.

They have been amazing and fired-up to help, but I have had to navigate the Tempest in our classrooms and schools before more specifics come your way. The first day we are to be officially in compliance is February 1st, so that may be a wonderful, symbolic day to keep our spirit alive through the nation.

“I think,” he began, cautiously, “I think that, yeah, there is this much. But we wouldn’t know it. People don’t talk about it. For every news story about something tragic, there are ten more that nobody knows about because the newscast or the newspaper or the news website has to stop somewhere. Probably on a daily basis, they have to decide which murder to show because they can’t show all of them. They probably have to look at their ratings and figure out which section of the city has the most people watching, and then show the murder that’s closer to that section. So the murders in the other section don’t get talked about as much.” He spoke slowly and carefully.

A night spent eating some of the best food in the world with my best friend truly takes the cake as the best meal ever.
We were so pumped and shattered at the same time, there really was only one other serious bidder and us, the other guy bailed out before us and as the property didn't hit reserve we got the first opportunity to put in the first offer.....omg.....what to do?!?!?!? I believe it was at this point we felt things slipping away, we had already topped our top offer and didn't realise at the time we had a bit of flexability to go higher so we put our offer in just above what our top bid was, purely because we felt we had to do something. We left feeling really rotten, at this point we hadn't even told the kids what we were doing in case it fell over as it appeared to be doing. The agent then took the offer back to the trust, which took days to come back and reject it and again asking for the reserve price. We checked in again the mortgage guy who then confirmed we could go quite a bit higher, so another offer was put in, again, nowhere near their reserve, days go by and that offer was rejected but they came down 5 grand which the agent said was unusual that early in negotiations. Starting to feel quite good at this point until......we are told there is another offer on the table, and now have to sign a multi offer form and up our offer......this is all starting to get a bit yuck by now so up the offer we did, getting close to what we can go to, in fact we only had one more offer up our sleeve, days and days went by without hearing anything, house is slipping away, not gonna happen, get over it and get on with it we are thinking.....but out of the blue the phone call comes saying offer was accepted and what happened after that I really can't remember, things just started moving at a rapid pace and life was never the same again!
Polls suggest ARENA will maintain its municipal advantage, although the FMLN has a chance of unseating the conservative mayor in San Salvador, the country’s capital and largest city. The incumbent, ARENA’s Norman Quijano, faces a stiff challenge from Dep.

Schmucker Meister Pils is a clear, yellow-gold with a loose head. I have to say, the initial taste made me wince. It's clean-tasting all right, but with a sweet edge, then the hops come in swiftly with a vaguely bile-like bitterness. It's a bit harsh, though not aggressively so, leaving an unpleasantly acrid finish. To be kind, i thought it might go better with some greasy food, but having another bottle with a BBQ a few days later it fared very badly with spicy, marinaded pork steaks. Not one I'd be in a hurry to try again.

Whisk the flour, oats, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt and nutmeg together in a large bowl. Drop in the butter and, using your fingers, toss to coat the pieces of butter with flour. Quickly, working with your fingertips (my favorite method) or a pastry blender, cut and rub the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture is pebbly. You'll have pea-size pieces, pieces the size of oatmeal flakes and pieces the size of everything in between -- and that's just right.

However, I have never sewed or made ruffles before. So, I guessed my way throught that part and cut 4 inch strips of fabric and hemmed one side. Then hand threaded a piece of strong thread through the top and bunched up the fabric to create the ruffle. I have no idea if that is the correct way to do it but that's what I did.

But that would be too easy wouldn’t it? If everything went to plan? My baby had developed swelling in a gland under her right ear during the day on the Sunday which had become increasingly worse during the night. I willed the nurses not too see it or question her too closely. I knew she was in pain but I wanted the operation to be over. It was selfish and in the end pointless. The anaesthetist noticed the swelling as we waited to go into the theatre and called an ENT to have a look. He diagnosed an acute inflammation of the salivary gland. The surgery was summarily cancelled. Damn you all, we were so close. Donna cried in pain, I cried in anger, in frustration and again, because I was guilty of being a bad mother. I just wanted it to be over… Instead we went home, antibiotic and cortisone in tow, to go right back to square one.
Really do love drawing African Americans. Since I live in an African American community, I of course get a lot of opportunity to draw and observe. Among AA youth, a lot of emphasis is put into having the right "look". This is understandable and sad considering the harsh environment and circumstances some of these kids have to endure on a daily basis. Having the right "look" becomes an initial line of defense in the Urban Jungle, and even your average street thug wants to pick out what he perceives to be an "easy" victim. Even so calked "civilized " folks who live in the hood have a kind of look that says "I belong here" from a purely anthropological standpoint it's fascinating....

There are several methods available to evaluate a website and its usability, such as heuristic inspection, observation, eye tracking, interview, user feedback and lab testing. Each method of website evaluation has its own level of intrusiveness to the users, with heuristic inspection being the least and lab testing being the most intrusive.

At the moment I hover. Unsure of who I am and who I want to be. I liked the idea of setting up a base with my partner, a place we can both operate from, live our lives how we wish and yet sharing it with each other. But I am not sure I can do it. Maybe I like the idea of it more than the actual implementation.

Things were different after that handshake. We never really argued again. Instead, on several occasions in his absence I would be in the middle of doing something like building a deck and hear his voice say over my shoulder, “Don’t you think you ought to give it one more nail just to be on the safe side?” It was years later before I realized that the handshake that day was more than a goodbye – it was a blessing. I believe the best departures happen with a blessing – a goodbye that acknowledges the freedom to move on in such a way that it allows the departing one to carry the nurturing caretakers of the nest with him or her.

A fantastic group of folks from all backgrounds and walks of life, they really helped me mature as a writer and I was sad to have to drop out of the group when the kids came along and my schedule became too hectic to be an active member.
Cutting around the image is ideal if your card bleeds or if you go over the line. You could also create a shadow around the image to hide going outside the line or use a blender pen to erase it as such. Remember to go from out to in when doing this with a blender pen & just do bit at a time & allow to dry in between cus if the card gets too wet then it will bleed no matter what card you use.

Another great thing about pomegranates are is that they keep FOREVER. At first they are perfectly round with a smooth surface and bright red to pink in color, then they age as the time wears on, turning dark red to magenta with areas of brown, their skin starts to wrinkle and get leathery, and they no longer are perfectly round, but in my opinion that just makes them more interesting.
And it left me thinking, I wonder whether it was foolish of me to believe that he really was being sincere. I didn’t want to think this way, but having been raised to be so cautious of old creepy men it came as a natural instinct to second-guess this man’s intentions.
Point 1. Eviatar claims a steady schedule is essential. This includes times of the week you always write, as well as times of the day. So far so good. He also writes that you need to honor your own needs. Writing is not like turning on a switch and some amount of warm up is a good idea. He suggests looking at email, making coffee, or whatever else “sets the mood.”

Dr. K. Sheldrake:
Do I want to self-publish? When I first decided I wanted writing to be my career, I never thought I would consider self-publishing. But here I am a couple of years down the road and not nearly as established as I thought I would be. I one manuscript signed with a small e-publisher, but nothing else. I have about a dozen finished manuscripts. I have about a hundred rejection letters. I don’t think I’m getting rejected because of the quality of my work. I think I’m pretty good. Either my friends are trying to make me feel better, or I’m not what the publishers are looking for.
But according to congressional aides, Boehner insists negotiations resume anew in Congress on a plan with spending cuts and few, if any, revenue increases — and without Obama.

The film’s tone – and all of the cast ranging from Rudd (obviously) to Rashida Jones (especially, both because she’s always hilarious and she’s not bad to look at) to Elizabeth Banks and Adam Scott (one of my favorite actors right now) to the always-hilarious Steve Coogan – is just spot on and reminded me of the way I felt after I watched The Kids Are Alright or Nick and Nora’s Infinite Playlist: two films that aren’t similar in any way except for the fact that I felt happy – elated really – when I was done watching them. Our Idiot Brother is made with the same intent: it’s not a film that’s trying to say anything deep or profound; it merely drops us in the middle of these people’s lives (it’s nice to see a movie about people in their 30s) and allows us to see how comfortable they are in their routines as their brother interjects his refreshing – and sometimes maddening – brand of honesty into their routine. There should be no surprises how the film ends (hint: all of his sisters have problems and Rudd affects their lives for the better, causing them to – gasp! – reevaluate their life choices); however, the film still works because the filmmakers (and cast) show restraint in not allowing the usual plot elements that trip up countless Sundance films to derail what they wanted to do. Just as Nick and Nora’s Infinite Playlist didn’t waste time having characters comment on New York music and nightlife for 20-somethings, so too does Our Idiot Brother not waste time commenting on organic farming, weed, lesbianism, or other elements that usually make up these kinds of movies because the characters have been living with it for so long. That’s the refreshing thing about this movie aside from Rudd’s performance: it allows the characters to act like they should act instead of commenting on things they would have no reason to still be commenting on. I have a lot of affection for this movie despite its many flaws. Will I remember this movie in ten years? Probably not, but it’s one of my favorite movies of the year thanks to Paul Rudd.

The rest came with us in our bags, packed to the max.

I really started showing interest in music at an early age. Both my mother and my father are big music lovers. Though they do not play any instruments they owned a big record collection and we listened to music a lot at home. Then I got my first guitar at age 12. A couple of friends of mine from school owned guitars and were taking guitar lessons and I picked up the basics from the two of them.

LG has just won another class action suit. One they believed they had no chance of winning. Since they realize this will be tied up in appeals for years, LG tries to go for an immediate settlement to get the money to the client faster. Seems reasonable. But Canning isn’t budging. In fact, he’s delaying the discussion because he is waiting for his attorney…one supermom, Patti Nyholm. Then the bomb drops…they are suing LG for $50 million for fraud. Basically the case should have been a $1 million settlement or jury trial. Instead LG insisted it be a bench trial and they were awarded $25 million. Canning and Nyholm are accusing LG of judicial tampering since the judge was someone Will played basketball with and mostly likely bribed for the favorable judgement. We know it isn’t true but with Will’s history and his issues with the bar association now public knowledge, that’s what they are playing off of. Not to get too off topic, but how can this not be an issue for the firm moving forward? In real life, they would have to cut Will loose for this exact reason…they can’t have every judgement that goes their way result in a countersuit for fraud. So regardless of whether or not Will is guilty (and he is) a struggling firm can’t have that liability around. Especially a firm that is in the financial straits (which learn later on) that LG is in. Diane will always have Will’s back and therefore will do anything for him. If Will were a bigger person, he would step down from the firm so they wouldn’t be vulnerable to these types of actions. But, since Josh Charles is a major character, he isn’t going anywhere.
With the enactment of a pension reform bill, legitimate rights and moral concerns are in jeopardy not only for teachers but for every citizen in the State of Illinois. Defrauding a person out of his or her guaranteed rights and benefits violates a most important interest in morality and ethics and basic legal principles of both the state and U.S. constitutions that protect every citizen. Attempting to find ways to break those promises through the likes of the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago’s Sidley Austin LLP is a costly and dangerous effrontery and precedent to set in motion.
Then a little something for those bare walls.
For a recent punishment sentence (and this is punishment of the worst kind!), I’ve taken away their Beyblades. Funny thing is it hasn’t stopped them from playing. They’ll motion the “let it rip!” in the air and pretend battle with each other (I told you they were “addicted”!) The boys were having so much that my daughter had to join in on the fun. She’d battle and pretend play right with them, but you can tell that she wasn’t as into it as the boys were, as if she was missing out.
In this, its century year, it’s not like that any more. Yes, it’s the one place you can find clothing chain stores, and Madrid’s best bookshop with La Casa de Libro’s flagship store. But the grand cafés have been replaced by tawdry souvenir shops, the grand houses of haut couture replaced by H&M. Gran Via is beginning to border on the seedy.
He was nice enough. It wasn't a deep meeting of souls at all but we had a sexual relationship. That's another post-worthy issue but to put it shortly, I had already 'gotten rid' of my virginity so there was no reason to hold out so why not? That was the whole reason, in a nutshell, that he and I ever had a sexual relationship to begin with.
The rest is a blur. Justin says something romantic like "So, we live here." and I laugh and agree.

So baseball has 162 games. That’s twice as many games as there are in the basketball season, twice as many games as there are in the hockey season, and more than ten times as many games as there are in the football season. If the Seahawks lose a heartbreaker, you have to live with that for an entire week! You’re stewing on that game and analyzing that game for an entire week. But baseball is played pretty much every day. If the Mariners suffer a heartbreaking loss, like they did last night, they’re back out there the next day. The memory of that loss might linger, but they are able to create a new memory. They can get out there and get after it and do what they can to erase the memory of that terrible loss.

You watch the real world fly by you out the windows, and it looks like a blur. You might catch a glimpse of something that looks interesting and say, "Excuse me, can we stop for a minute? I saw something cool out there." But they say they can't make unplanned stops. That would make the whole train late. When you finally realize how futile it is to ask, you might find ways to sneak off and get to a destination on your own. Or you might just stop looking out the window.

Seeing and feeling all the intervals and the rhythms in a performance should not be hard, it should be about relaxing and letting go, being taken by the music through a journey of discovery. This is one of the main advantages improvised music has over computer-assisted composition – there’s no way to predict which feelings and rhythms will be expressed beforehand. All we have is a sort of road map that we have to refer to in order to communicate – harmony, melody and rhythm.
Now comes THE END OF AN ERA! The Undertaker vs Triple H Part 3 with special guest referee, The Heartbreak Kid Shawn Michaels in the HELL IN A CELL!!!

That being said let’s get to the meat of this match!

I will learn more on Friday about what exactly will be expected of me and the timeline for completing it. I have a good idea of what I need to do but I don’t know how long it will take or what the course structure is. I am planning to work diligently in the next 2-3 weeks since my kids are out of school at the end of the month. Mason’s last day is May 18th and Aidan’s last day is May 25th. I know it’s not realistic to have it completely finished but I’m trying to minimize daycare cost.

Every Thursday night in an underground arts club in the heart of Notting Hill, London magic of a musical form takes place. Only the best get the honour of singing there, amazing DJ’s get to play records you wouldn’t hear in any Oceana or Liquid, this is the heart of real music and the place for real music lovers as I discovered on my first visit last night to the famous YOYO night.

(1) I'm not a football fan really (I support Airdrie United, after all and I know about football as much as I, as a Status Quo fan, know about music), but one of our leading Scottish teams, Glasgow Rangers, has been hugely in the news because of its financial troubles. If you don't know about it and you want to, google it. There are way too many articles I could point you to; the whole thing has been keeping journalists going at full tilt for a week or two. Suffice to say, something stinks in the financial wheelings and dealings at the centre of it all. Big time, it stinks.
This aspect makes the game and its experience all the more life-like and fulfilling.
The melodies are mostly created on my acoustic guitar. Then I make some kind of a drum loop for the main line. Then record the whole thing using my 4-track & CPU, it's as simple as that.
In a way that was a good thing as it meant the game progressed at a more even rate but unfortunately it also meant that I didn’t quite get the same level of immersion out of the side quests – or maybe I just missed the best ones while pursuing the main quest?
There were some cheeses there: that absolutely excellent Black Diamond Aged Cheddar, a one year-old Gouda, and some Stilton-wrapped-in-something abomination. It wasn't really a pairing per se, Steve just happened to have some cheese laying around, and purchased that Stilton one that came highly recommended (which we both found laughable). But regardless, it was a great afternoon to sit and chip away at our stockpiles.

Each week I set out enough art supplies for the kids to make 2-3 projects. Some of the kids chose to make one project and others wanted to make them all. I also provided a treat for them each week. We had snow cones, ice cream sundaes, cookies, brownies, ect. It ended up being a lot of fun and something the kids looked forward to each week. At the end of of the summer I hosted an art show for the kids to show off their artwork.

1) South Indians have a written classical music. This has enormous implications. It separates them from north Indians who have no canon of music. The average southerner can assess a performance of his classical music better than the average northerner can…. To appreciate Hindustani music other than instinctively, a northerner must study the deep form of his music, which few can.
The fitbit has a lot of features. Counting the amount of calories I burn is of course my favorite feature but there are so many others. Every time you sync to your fitbit account it tells you how many steps you have taken, how many stairs you have climbed (very accurate), miles traveled, calories burned and it also gives you an active score based on how active you were that day.

In my time away, I will be concentrating on better health, weight loss and more activity and getting back to my machine embroidery and hopefully, smocking. I hope that doing some smocking will limber up my arthritic hands. Sitting at the computer has become all too common for my activity of the day and it's time to do something to change that. I will miss reading your blogs, but I will be back... hopefully with good news of my progress and the status of our family.

When I awoke this morning I was mentally singing a fragment of Cassandra Wilson‘s Gone with the Wind, but I have no idea why as I haven’t listened to the song for a while? The brain’s capacity for latching onto a piece of music and then refusing to let go is one that has fascinated psychologists, neurologists and psychoanalysts, yet seemingly all we can say about earworms is that they are a consequence of a repetitive melody which lacks some sort of climax to break the cycle.

What this shows is that YECs have a distorted view of the uniformitarian principle… It would be unfair to say that these criticisms of the principle would never have been true, since they would have been earlier when modern geology was coming around. What has to be mentioned is that before, geologists had practiced a variety of uniformity now called substantive uniformitarianism. Today, however, geologists have long rejected that version in favor of another called methodological uniformitarianism… The variety that YECs spend their time knocking down is the one no longer practiced. Today’s geology does not rule out the possibility of unusual events and massive disasters; in fact they fit in well with uniformity. Also, the idea that all rate accumulations must have been the same for all times in all cases is not a concept in uniformity either; the process in play may have existed, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they constantly happen with the same intensity.

At last, at around 9 pm we saw the first glimpse of a group of 10 or so penguins in the ocean and swimming towards us. But seagulls wanting an even better glimpse of the nightly event had created somewhat of a barricade on the water’s edge, confusing the penguins and making it difficult for them to get through. Eventually, a lone brave penguin pushed through and paved the way for his comrades to go up the beach, past the squabbling seagulls.

Whitney Houston gave the world a gift, and that gift, was her. She was a true talent with a voice that was so powerful. Her singing inspired through the infectious words she belted out, the melodies that could evoke goosebumps in the coldest of hearts and the perpetual innovation and progression of her art. She was a favorite of mine when I was just a child, and her messages have always been timeless.

There isn't an underlying message. The book is about Rayner finding Faith (the woman), both literally and figuratively. The books in this series do seem to have an underlying theme—the difference between living and existing. Living is getting out and doing things you enjoy, spending time with people you love. Existing is getting bogged down in the everyday stuff that we feel we need to get done. It is shocking how easy it is to get caught up in all the "existing," and forget to do any "living."

As a season finale, it’s obviously got a lot of backstory and buildup from earlier in the season, though a great deal of this occurred at the end of the immediately previous episode, in which President Bartlet (played by the amazing Martin Sheen) loses a close personal friend. Much of “Two Cathedrals” deals with that relationship in flashback, with a ‘Chekov’s Gun’ that will show up later.

It's not that I don't like a break now and then. I just don't buy the idea that the break is "because I'm worth it" or that I'm taking "the time to be me". What is "me", if not the sum of all my relationships and obligations? A customer, that's what. The more you give, the more you are. Think of Chekhov, with his patients and his crowds of dependent relatives, whose living room became such a public space that he had to put up no smoking signs. His advice to young writers was "travel third class". Ralph Waldo Emerson's was to "buy carrots and turnips".
H: I want to put to you some of the criticisms that have been raised about why and how the IDF conducted Operation Cast Lead, including objections raised by columnists in this newspaper. It’s been asserted that we, Israel, invaded their territory, and they were defending themselves against us. The kill ratio, of approximately 100 to 1, has been highlighted as ostensible evidence of the IDF’s disproportionate use of force. It’s been argued that, of course Hamas didn’t engage in open, conventional conflict with us – army to army, in uniform – because they would have lost. Their only chance was to fight from within residential areas. And it’s been asserted, again as evidence of an ostensible Israeli overreaction, that while Israel sustained a little over two dozen fatalities from their attacks on us between 2005 and 2008, their losses in that period totaled 1,250.

When I learned CHLOE was a finalist in the Romance Writers of America’s 2010 Golden Heart contest and received a near-perfect score in the preliminary round, I finally sent the manuscript to my agent. After subbing CHLOE to a very small, targeted group of publishers, multiple houses chimed in with interest. When I heard the editor from Amulet, Maggie Lehrman, was a member of her high school’s radio station, I knew I’d found the perfect home for CHLOE.

After the reenactment we watched a short School House Rock video, "No More King." Finally, we made a taxes foldable. At this point the students were really interested in finding out about the real taxes the colonists were expected to pay. We even learned about the Sons of Liberty, and they decided they supported them. I made the tax collectors wear gloves so I could redistribute the M&Ms at the end of the lesson. They were so relieved to find out their candy was being returned to them. I don't think this is a history lesson they will soon forget, and that truly is Classroom Magic!
Anyway, this week at the last minute Greg was offered a consulting gig in middle Tennessee, and 24 hours later, we were on the road. Our first stop was Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky, one of the places I have been wishing to visit for quite a while. We toured the cave. It was Mammoth. We drove across the ferry, explored the park, did very little hiking due to the 95 degree heat, and we spent the night in a Wigwam. We did cheesy touristy things and much fun was had. Then we went to Nashville to visit our friends Thomas and Dita and their two babies. Then we spent the night at a nice hotel and the kids and I goofed off while Greg worked. Great fun was had by all, and even though it was only a 3 day trip, I think we crammed in as much fun as possible.

A. “The iPhone, when you take it out of the box, has Voiceover with it. You don’t have to load other screen reader stuff. You don’t have to try to figure out how to get the thing to talk. You just press a couple of buttons, and there is Voiceover up and working on any iPhone. So suddenly, on that initial screen that you open up with the iPhone, there are twenty native apps–that just means little programs that come with it–that are created by Apple. All of those talk! All of a sudden, you have a talking GPS (navigational software for outdoor travel), you have a talking maps feature and you have a talking calendar.
Another critic of these zoning ordinances was Raymond Hood. In the 1920s he argued that instead of the setbacks proposed by Corbett and Ferriss, there should be imagined slender shafts soaring above expansive open spaces – a “modern city of sunlight, air, and free circulation.” He first articulated this idea in 1924 in The New York Times article “City of Needles,” and he continued to promote the concept in numerous places in 1926-1929 in response to the contemporary debate planners over the skyscraper and congestion.

Five minutes later, and I’d already bought a 1963 Pan edition of Partners in Crime by Agatha Christie, and the 1968 book Poor Cow by Nell Dunn, author of Up the Junction. It’s too dangerous for my wallet’s health to linger so we did a quick flutter around the arts and crafts found in Gabriel’s Wharf before retiring to a secret place overlooking the river, continuing our evening inside while the sunset transformed the water into dusky pink and shot silver.
They decided to send Robert Fortune, a botanist, to China and steal the secrets of tea. It was no easy task as China was pretty much still closed to the world. It was said that he was dressed in Chinese robes, wore a fake pigtail, and speaks Mandarin, a language that he was already fluent in. Apparently he went unnoticed on a few trips to the Chinese inlands. Author Sarah Rose calls this the greatest act of corporate espionage in history, which I think sums it up. Fortune sneaked the tea seedlings and plants from China and learnt the secrets of making tea-growing viable in India after several trials. Today, tea is grown in the Assam and Darjeeling region. Tea was also introduced to Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon, as a crop substitute after the coffee plants were plagued with a disease.
St Mary's Lodge by the main King William Walk gates appeared to be open for teas and other 'diary pub' items. Then a right turn to admire the Sammy Offa wing, the new face of the National Maritime Museum now opening on to the Park.
They say Trayvon Martin has become a symbol. If by symbol they mean, the racist killing of a black kid by a semi white guy, they are wrong. If by symbol they mean, a glaring display of Media, political, and mass public hypocrisy, then bingo, hit that nail on the head. When you latch on to a single, rare, isolated incident, while ignoring the mass extermination of a particular racial/age group, you are as full of shit as a Christmas goose, and as counterfeit as the ring masters of what has become a circus. Justice, like Elvis, has left the building, whatever the outcome in this case, justice won't play a role in it. So for those demanding an arrest or payback, absent all of the facts, stop calling for justice. Justice isn't what you want, you want blood, you want to affix blame, you want to assuage your white guilt or black anger. If you wanted justice, you would let it run it's course, not rush to it. So give it a name, payback, blood, eye for an eye, just don't confuse it with actual justice. That train left the station before the facts had a chance, and it ain't coming back.

There’s more. Tennessee got a player listed in the Rivals Top 100. Safety LaDarrell McNeil is a Texan. For some reason he chose the Vols over the likes of the Longhorns.

Throw in Nathan Peterman, who may be the best QB coming out of the state of Florida.
Since the Tunisian revolution, a question on the minds of many outside observers has been: what impact will the changes in the country have on religious minority communities?

Kort, in his usual bravado wanted the two tested to show what they could provide to the company should trouble find us.

Is it necessary is something we have to ask ourselves because something we want to say might be funny or informative or juicy news but then again might not be necessary. We all have things at times we want to share but in reality these things are destructive and not worth saying. We underestimate the power of words so we need to ask how necessary it is to share information and stories with other people. When we go to say anything to people we should ask ourselves these three questions: Is it true? Is it kind? Is it necessary?
These are the labour movements/pains for us as a changing planet and people, as the baby is getting closer to its birth now. The baby being our new world. This means the contractions will be felt more deeply by those who were unaware they were birthing. So challenges for everyone in various areas of life are an ongoing theme, but if you are used to this theme and learning to stabilise it, you will easier breathe through the contractions and harness the heights available in the expansions.
The Boers were among the first settlers to arrive in Comodoro. The population in 1903 was just 140; now it's the biggest city in Patagonia with a population of 300 000. They soon began to build roads and telegraph lines so that they could link their land, as well as schools, bridges and dams -- all through their own efforts and resources. They worked hard, subsisted poorly and lived up to their hardy reputation.

What would you say is the sexiest part of female anatomy? If you said, "eyebrows," what the fuck is wrong with you? Why would you say that? I'm getting the willies just thinking about what kind of person would choose eyebrows as the sexiest. The image of them cowering naked in some nondescript basement, surrounded by posters of women with robust eyebrows, is so vivid, so real, that I can practically taste the unplucked awkwardness on my chapped lips. However, if you're able to admire a tastefully orchestrated close-up of a woman's eyebrows and surrounding eye region every now and then, and are not a complete weirdo about it, you'll definitely enjoy The New York Ripper, Lucio Fulci's grisly tribute to misogyny and downtown homicide. Wait a minute, did you say, "grisly tribute"? Why, yes, I did. You see, in order to savour the eye-flavoured camera work in this film, you're also gonna have to endure a fair amount of ghastliness. It's what we in the eyebrow appreciation business call a "trade-off." Let me put it this way: No-one in their right mind is gonna allow someone to make a movie solely about eyebrows, and no-one in their right mind is gonna allow someone to make a movie solely about murder. This Manhattan set slasher film attempts to strike a balance between the two subjects by giving the bloodthirsty sickos in the audience the over-the-top carnage they so wantonly crave, while at the same time throwing a bone to the eyebrow crowd. And in that regard, I think this film will definitely silence the critics out there who think extreme gore and eyebrow fetishism can't co-exist with one another.

Which finally brings us up to ITI 2011. Due to Gretch’s work schedule, she was not able to attend ITI this year. So I went alone. This marked the longest period of time we have been separated since we started dating on 16 August 2007. However, frequent telephone calls during free time and occasional chats on Google helped us make it through the week. Besides, many of our ITI friends are married and also spend the week apart. So we knew we’d be okay. Everyone asked how Gretch was doing and where she was. It was great to know that so many people care.

It is ideal for any small gifts and I love how this project turned out. The card only measures 4 x 4 inches, not a lot of room for layers, so I kept it simple. The DP I used is by Doodlebug and it was perfect for this project....I bought a 12 x12 piece as I liked it so much, but didn't buy anything else in the same line to match it!! So it suited a simple layout!! I used my favourite Gorjuss girl, she is coloured with copics, cut out and popped up with foam pads onto a nestie cut circle that has been embossed with a joy crafts embossing stencil.
How is this to be achieved? I don't have a clue but, believe me, it is not rocket science. It is a combination of nonce, greed, exploitation, ruthlessness, and testosterone - all qualities I have in abundance. (I would invite you to view my testicles if this were not a public domain.)

But I cannot ignore the elephant in the room: the hall was near-impossible to traverse. Three people could not pass down the aisles simultaneously, so it was very dificult for people to browse your work comfortably most of the time. Exhibitors on the central aisles were crammed in back to back with almost no room for manoeuver, and it was hard to stand up and engage with people face to face because there was inevitably a chair in your way, buckling you at the knees.

If one accepts that one person in a million goes to the best university and has the change to become really innovative, then Mainland China wins (with 1,340 people), Europe will be in second place (833 person ) and the US (312 person) third place. Hong Kong gets only 8 of these talented people. Hong Kong should become a platform where demand and supply come together. According to Mr Cheung Hong Kong can bring together IP owners that want to sell some of their IP, via IP intermediaries (for this Hong Kong needs officials, professionals, scientists and financiers) so that investors can buy IP. Now only goods and services are traded. There should be transformation to IP.

The players used the pre-generated characters, and I used the introductory adventure, Black Fang.

Ever since the first Twilight installment three years ago, I’ve complained that Kristen Stewart isn’t much of an actor, but now I don’t think the trouble here. Oh sure, she’s still pretty un-good, but then teen melodramas- and supernatural trappings aside, that’s what these movies are- have long been full of subpar performers. No, the trouble is that she’s the wrong kind of bad actor for this movie. A character arc like this requires someone capable of big emotions, as the story takes her from wedding-eve jitters to honeymoon passions to pregnancy-gone-bad illness. If your leading lady can’t manage to give a deeply felt performance, the next best thing is to get someone who can hit the high notes with panache and charisma. Unfortunately, Stewart lacks both of these traits, instead relying on over-rehearsed fussiness that’s a hallmark of actors who aim to be serious without necessarily being any good.

The summer movie season starts off with the Hunger Games. Adapted from the book “Hunger Games” written by Suzanne Collins it takes place in a future society that is seeing the effects of a major war. The world is broken apart in different districts that are all under the control of a region called the capitol. The capitol holds yearly a ‘game’ in which two people, a boy and a girl, from each district compete in an arena to the death. The idea behind the games is to keep control over the districts by instilling fear into them. Why would they even think about revolting.

Friday morning found me once again in Portsmouth for another TV segment, outdoors in the fog. It was probably not the best weather to televise the "after" part of a garden renovation we did for the station, but sometimes you have got to go with what you have been given. However, the weather was good for photography, unless you were wanting to get a picture across the river of the Norfolk skyline.

Mason has turned into a chatter box. Lots of times it is cute, other times it is not. I think I have a hard time because he has a hard time trying to explain his thoughts. "um mom, well um, that thing um, mom, um I like that, um thing, mom, mom, mom um mom...." If I don't answer and acknowledge what he is saying he will say mom mom mom mom over and over again to the point of driving me crazy. Or he will repeat something he wants or something he wants to do over and over again until I acknowledge him "mom I want to go to the park" "mom lets go to the park" "mom I said we should go to the park"

Oily, 'roasty', hopped with restraint, and with an alcohol content which must have been deviously concealed by Darth Avery himself, assuming such a malevolent figure exists.)
I have written a short story also and have subbed it by email today, so I'm feeling pretty good about a productive day so far.

Here’s why.
Chris and I had to wait a long time before the nice man from the stone yard could come to our house and make a template of you on our vanity. We decided you'd look best with a 15 inch Kohler undermount sink and 3 1/2 inch backsplashes.
At the risk of having a Sophs-overload post, when I saw the theme for Day 7... I immediately thought of Sophie's precious, adorable, perfect little button nose. I know I am biased because she is my baby- but come onnnn-- doesn't she just make your heart melt?!?

Just writing to let you know our trip to London, England has been a mess. I was having a great time until last night when we got mugged and lost all my cash,credit card cellphone It has been a scary experience, I was hit at the back of my neck with a club. Anyway...... I'm still alive and that's whats important. I'm financially strapped right now and need your help. I need you to loan me some $$, I'll refund it to you as soon as i arrive home.Write me back so i can tell you how to get it to me.
Curating an international arts festival, says Adelaide Festival artistic director Paul Grabowsky, isn't simply a matter of assembling a shopping list. And it's complicated. "With something like the Adelaide Festival, there are so many areas to cover," he says. "The performing arts, literature, visual art, film, public outdoor events... they're all things which people rightly expect..." And all this has to be made into a coherent event, a narrative that gives the public a sense of a journey. A daunting task, one might think.
I hope you enjoy my newfound abilities at card makeing, as much as I did.
Are you a fan of Joshua Mays’ rhythmic flow as he moves between Love and Momentum? Or were you one of the many who gleaned inspiration and power from Favianna Rodriguez as she showed us all that Art is her Hammer? If you answered yes to either of these questions or both, then you are in luck.
Apart from these players there are plenty of other players in both the red and blue jerseys, such as Downing, Carroll, Meireles, Sturridge, Adam, P.Cech, P. Reina, who needs to play out a good game to turn out victorious.
In the near future, we will be watching Mallrats, as that is next in the chronological order of Kevin’s films. This is a film that was hated by critics, so it will be interesting to see what Liz thinks of it. Hopefully, she’ll be a bit healthier for this watch and I can encourage her to give me more feedback. If I’m not mistaken it is cat-free, so we’ll see how she takes that. Also, while I say that we will be watching it in the near future, she is a busy law school student, so that could mean that we’ll watch it in a week or a month. Be patient with these posts. But I promise that we will talk about them all in time.
The pie had the lovely sweetness from the apples and the crumb topping....contrasted with the yummy tartness of the cranberries. I heard a couple of people mentioned that it tasted like the holidays. Perfect!!

I was pretty worried about how the weekend began.
I got to thinking. Men, God love them, can have their Hooters, but wouldn’t it be cool to have a restaurant chain that catered to women? But not in the male stripper vein; I’m talking a classy place with napkins you feel guilty getting your lipstick on, and refined, polite waiters who live to make sure you have a pleasurable dining experience.

On September 6 of the same year, petitioner filed a motion for relief under Rule 38, praying for the setting aside of the decision on the ground of excusable negligence. The alleged negligence consisted of the erroneous computation by counsel’s clerk of the period within which an appeal may be made, said clerk being of the impression that the prescriptive period to appeal in certiorari cases is also 30 days like in ordinary civil actions instead of 15 days as provided in Section 17 of Rule 41. The motion for relief was denied for lack of merit. Petitioner interposed an appeal to the Court of Appeals but this court certified the case to us, the question involved herein being one of law.

Blend 8oz (22g) plain wheatmeal flour with ½ teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon baking powder. Rub in 2oz (50g) margarine or cooking fat or dripping, then add enough water to make a rolling consistency, although one that is slightly softer than when making pastry with white flour. Roll out and use as in the individual recipe.

God said that though the temple that Solomon built was imposing, all who passed by it (in Israel’s disobedience to God) would see the evident disaster; they would see it forsaken. This is the time we need to most trust our God. This period of uncertainty and instability is the point at which we should all be praying that God take over; that he heal and restore our land; spiritually, governmentally, politically, and economically.

Sure some of the embellishment in this post is just that; embellishment for the sake of making a clear declaration of agreement and sending a respectful message to Jeff Wilpon for committing.....to? No ~ for just committing to a focused idea instead of reactive, first-aid riddled roster moves.
She is on Spring Break this week but I plan to call the school and try to talk to her so that she knows that I am here and I love her and I miss her very much. I am trying to get up the money to get a Lawyer and get her home with her brother and sisters where she belongs! Jordan told me today that Easter didnt feel right and we did not feel like a family because Livia was not home! It hurts to hear my 10 year old say that!
This took us to Meijer Gardens, in Grand Rapids. There we dodged field trips and grandparents with grandchildren in tow, and walked through the Butterfly Conservatory, caterpillar room, and a few of the outdoor garden offerings. Though cold, the downpour stopped long enough for us to grab a few shots of tulips which weren't totally blowing in the breeze.

Ah, Insurgent, how I have waited so very long to read you. Considering Veronica Roth’s debut novel, Divergent, was one of the most anticipated 2011 releases and has had notorious popularity since, there was no way to avoid the constant barrage of Insurgent-related hubbub, which DROVE ME CRAZY! Luckily I received my pre-order just 3 days after its release date.

I don’t like the show much, because, honestly, where the hell are these kids’ parents? The have an underground bunker with a rocket ship and are regularly on the other side of the planet or exploring space, and there is never hide nor hair of a responsible adult around. In one episode the kids actually fly to Mars to scale Olympus Mons, now you can’t tell me that was a quick trip and no one ever noticed four kids and a rocket ship were missing. There should have been grief stricken parents and dozens of police cars to greet them on their return, but nope, they just peacefully fly back into the bunker without anyone knowing. The Einsteins’ parents suck.
very light pink and blue. There is a radiance about white that makes the color purer than how you see it with your physical eyes, as well as how your physical body responds to the essence of Winter throughout one’s life. Spring is yellow; summer is a blend of red and orange which we will call “flame”. Autumn’s colors are brown and gold. Certain events take place during each of the seasons. Some of these simply mark time. However, some events have long been treated as “holy days” that have become sacred due to the ceremonies and festivals that take place, and so on. With each season, the most important and powerful of the sacred days are: winter and summer solstices, and the spring and autumn equinoxes. These are times of “passage”…of the Earth going through, every year, its own Rite of Passage. Humans experience such times in their own lives by experiencing going through a Rite of Passage. One is never really the same when one-steps out of one stage of human life into another. Saying that a person is never the same should not be interpreted as something negative. Quite the contrary. If there were no change, the Earth, symbolically speaking, would be stand still, be useless and bereft of its own “self” and power.

Securing Lee and Cushing was a coup for producer Gordon, since it lent a certain atmosphere reminiscent of Hammer Films, many of which starred both of the actors. However, when Cushing arrived in Madrid to begin work on the picture, he was still distraught over the recent death of his beloved wife, and announced to Gordon that he could not do the movie. With Gordon desperate over the idea of losing one of his important stars, Lee stepped in and put Cushing at ease simply by talking to him about some of their previous work together. Cushing changed his mind and stayed on.

Historic steam beer, associated with San Francisco & and the U.S. West Coast, was brewed with lager yeast without the use of refrigeration. It was an improvised process, originating out of necessity, perhaps as early as the Gold Rush. It was considered a cheap & low-quality beer as shown by references to it in literature of the 1890s & 1900s.
Well, as I posted before, I'm a bit busy atm working on a special order and catching up on some things. It's muggy and hot and I just plain don't do well in the heat. It wears me out quickly. What this means is that creatively ... I'm working on stuff. I have some finished items that need blocking or assembly, and I have some that are blocked or finished that need a photo session....but right now I don't have anything that I can share today. :-(

Our ultrasound is August 2nd. We're still debating on determining the gender. Originally I wanted to wait, but I want to be as prepared for this baby as I was his/her siblings. We've also had a hard time deciding on names, so maybe knowing the sex will help. David doesn't want to know, so it's a constant debate. :) I'm leaning toward boy, but Brooklynn thinks she's getting a sister (and she was right with Trail)...
He goes on to write about his "wonderful wife" who suffered judgment from women such as Dr Ford because they chose to be homemakers.
It was the responsibility of the groom’s family to ensure there was enough food and drink for all the guests. To fulfill this public social role, most families needed to draw not only on their own family resources, but also on the help of colleagues from their social group. How well the feast went communicated to guests the family’s social status and honor. To run out of wine at a wedding feast, therefore, would have inflicted grave humiliation on the groom’s family, signaling that they were unable to fulfill their role adequately and that they lacked the social connections to preserve their honor.

I prefer to use a wooden spoon with my Pyrex bowls. As I bake, I remember Grandma fondly. These Pyrex bowls are comforting to me. Grandma kept these for a reason, and I intend to keep them and bake with them for as long as I am able – perhaps with my own grandchildren someday.
Another possibility is that the fellow chose to empty his bladder into the reservoir because it was too big a target to miss. As every lavatory attendant knows, the human male is a remarkably inaccurate pisser. My friend Lady Chuffington has a grand home in England which contains several bathrooms and standalone lavatories. In every one of them is a sign with the following instructions on it:

The Labour council say they have no choice because their budget has been cut, but they do have a choice. The council should refuse to implement the cuts and instead set a needs budget (a budget which meets the real needs of people in the area) and follow the heroic example set by the Liverpool council in the 1980s. They could do this by using the council reserves for now, whilst building a mass campaign amongst trade unionists, community campaigners, students and young people to support the council and demand the necessary funding from central government. This is exactly what they did in Liverpool and they won! If every Labour council in the country did this then it would bring this ConDem government crashing down.

Going along with that, there were a few instances when Cujo was about to “attack” someone and the camera wasn’t quite positioned right, or they didn’t edit the scene properly, and you could clearly see Cujo’s tail wagging. Again, not necessarily something you would picture happening in a dog about to bite someone’s throat out, but rather the action of a dog that is “doing what I’m being told to do”. Later on, it seemed that the director must have noticed the dog was wagging its tail a little too much, because in some scenes the tail was tucked between the back legs and didn’t move at all (you know, kind of like what a tail would do if it was tied down…).

The Distillery – These six men were the brains and muscle behind the prosperous alcohol making industry on the estate. It would appear that these Africans practiced a systematic approach to working in teams and participation was not about the resume of skills and experiences but cultural bonds. In the distillery community practitioners were from the African Congo presumably these men brought with them from the continent the knowledge, skills and experiences of brewing, fermentation, and so on. Interestingly, the massive underground boilers have survived over the centuries and are now subject to excavation on Wingfield showing the eighteen century improvements to the boiler and flue system. Again this is a possible theme for further research about the nature and significance of the distillery to Wingfield’s development over the centuries.

Happy Friday everyone!! Never have I been so happy to see the end of the work week. For a couple of months now we have had a sewage problem in the basement at my office. They think that there is a hole in one of the pipes under the concrete floor in the bathroom, and let me tell you, the smell is absolutely disgusting. Some days we hardly smell it at all, but this week it has been particularly strong. If the landlord doesn’t get it fixed soon, I’m going to go postal!!! So, I am really looking forward to breathing in fresh air all weekend and clearing all of the toxic fumes that I must be breathing in out of my system.

Speaking of being hurried out of this world: today is Soren Kierkegaard's birthday (1813-1855). On a bookshelf behind my chair sits a framed quote (I like to think of it as my prayer) by this Danish philosopher and theologian. I've included it in a previous post, probably two years ago now, but I'm re-posting it today not only as a way to honor him, but also to remind myself to pray for this daily and to live it more effectively:
Because God made the world for Godself–but the Sabbath He created for us.

On more then one occasion he was accused of being a murderer. And of course, they were right. He had to kill his enemy, this after all was war. But the difference between this war and other wars, were the reasons behind it. It was a rebellion fueled by a desire to make things right and stop the abusive behavior of the government. Let’s face it; there are times when this simply has to be done. The evil is simply too great to stand around doing nothing. One famous Che quote says: “Let me say, at the risk of seeming ridiculous, that the true revolutionary is guided by great feelings of love” Che killed, but we have to remember that this was simply a counter measure to the slaughter of innocent civilians by the government. Were people simply supposed to stand around and be slaughtered? The answer to that question is a resounding “HELL NO!”

Tyrion discovers that his sister has been consulting a Pyromancer and has stockpiled Wildfire in order to defend King’s Landing from her brother in law Stannis. The death of Renly Baratheon is felt even this far away, as this means there is one less foe for Stannis to face before he reaches the Lannister’s stronghold. In typical Tyrion form, he commandeers the stockpile of Wildfire for his own, which begs the question; what is Tyrion’s endgame?
In charity shop number one there was a buy-one-get-one-free on children's books so we got a modern Ladybird about baby animals (which kept little miss amused in the pushchair) and a book for my eldest about fairies with all sorts of little flaps and things. I think there's a few fiddly bits missing but at 50p for the two I'm not complaining! We also got the cup below, I hope you can see properly but it's like a honeypot with what looks like honey and some little bees floating around in the sealed base. Very cute, little one loves it as she's very into Pooh and I love my bees. I'm not sure if we'll use it as a cup or maybe a crayon or pencil pot.
However, handmade gifts take time, effort and a lot of creative energy.
Shannon's Attitude is a sheer grape colored jelly base with holographic bar glitter and micro holographic glitter. The glitter did bunch together a bit so I found it easier to apply it by placing a drop on the nail and then spreading it around. This provided better distribution of glitter over the regular method of application. The camera really doesn't do justice to this glitter as the the bars truly sparkle and shift color. Each little bar is a rainbow and contains the full spectrum of colors. The jelly base adds a slight purple tint to the polish it is layered over.

Yes, even the medical community is realizing the extraordinary benefits of MSM and it’s now being used very successfully and more frequently in the repair of scar tissue, to repair cut, scraped, damaged and even burned skin. Doctors throughout the world are using MSM as a prefered treatment for burn victims because it works so well in healing and repairing the skin. Medical professionals are learning that MSM can do wonders in the aid of skin disorders as well. When used topically, this sulfur compound is helpful in treating skin disorders such as acne, psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis, dandruff, scabies, diaper rash and certain fungal infections. And get this. MSM is currently being tested and showing great results as an effective non-toxic treatment agent against malastatic melanoma. A non-toxic treatment for skin cancer? Well, I did say it was extraordinary, didn’t I? It has also been used quite successfully in eliminating chronic back pain, muscle pain and joint pain and inflammation.

Obviously, the same principles are at work in coffee making. The French press makes a wonderful, rich, flavorful cup of coffee, but the single infusion of water can only take up so much extract from the coffee grounds. Just as in beer making, a slow, continuous stream of hot water extracts much more from the same volume of coffee.
I am determined to use only real butter because I know thatit is actually a real substance and not chemically "created".

The opening sequence, with Michael Palin emerging from the water as the tattered "It's" Man, takes just a little too long for my liking. Still, seeing this hairy scruffian wearing the haggard shreds of a suit emerge from the sea, only to collapse and sigh the word, "It's..." before the animated credits roll is iconic absurdism.

It’s something I’ve wanted to do for a few years but always thought “I couldn’t”. This Amazon has long-held the belief that I have a body that wasn’t built for cardio… I think it’s time I proved myself wrong.
This past week, I think we took some pretty great steps. Two moments in particular made me smile from ear to ear. Since this was spring break, we took the opportunity to get away for a few days. We went to my husband’s family’s beach house – with his whole extended family! Though it is far more people than my son and I are used to, it is also great to find our way in the big, and I do mean BIG picture. When all of them are there, there are 25 people, 15 of which are under the age of 17. Justin and I have now been with them on multiple occasions. But this time was different. Why was it different you ask? Well, for one Justin referred to the other kids as his cousins. And the other kids, well, they referred to me as Aunt Debbie. See, it may be tough for our kids to make the adjustment to the blended family within the house, but as far as the extended family goes, we are already accepted.

Last weekend we enjoyed the annual end of year piano recital at the younger two's music teacher's home. She is one of the kindest woman I know, always encouraging the children and making them feel good about their achievements.
Alternative school models, such as the Montessori and Sudbury models, are much more effective in educating students. That makes them much more valuable.
About 2004, I had the pleasure of working with an older engineer I knew who was much more experienced than I was, but who had retired around 1999 and came back to work as a technician. He was assigned to be my technician because we were developing a very complex receiver, unlike anything our company had ever done before and the bosses wisely thought two guys would be better than one. While we were both rather experienced, he started in electronics long before I did and in the fine-detailed circuit design, he was definitely my superior. He retired a second time around '06, and has managed to remain retired this time, playing music for spare change/beer money around the Silicon Swamp area.
Resolutions don't erase your past, just in case the irony of my last post wasn't clear. On the contrary, I think resolutions acknowledge that you have room for improvement. It's looking life in the face & saying, I can do this differently, if not better. Which is always good, right?
In other words can you please shut up if your not going to bring any evidence leave all these people alone and let people believe what they want to believe. Telling the truth your being almost exactly like a Jehovah’s witness coming and knocking at my door.
What we seem to be observing is an increasing number of full-fledged patent strategies being maintained by companies other than the original owner. This poses both a research and a pedagogical challenge. From the research perspective, it will be interesting to study the considerations that enable the acquirer to value a huge patent portfolio based primarily on the "defensive" worth of the patents, ex ante, and to evaluate whether the acquisition was worthwhile, post ante. Will we conclude that these acquisitions were a reasonable business risk or simply the patent version of the "dot.com" bubble from a decade ago? From the pedagogical point of view, these developments underscore the fact that there are now new and substantial corporate actors that must be taken into account in any consideration of patent strategy, actors whose considerations are quite different from those that presumably drive a company in its formulating and implementing a patent strategy (I am not talking about mass patent aggregators, such as Intellectual Ventures. For a superb discussion of patent aggregrators, see Tom Ewing & Robin Feldman,"The Giants Among Us" here.) Virtually no materials or even pedagogical guides exist for this. For this Kat, the challenge of considering patent strategy in these changing circumstances is "Fear and Trembling: part II."

Governor Christie spent his first two years in office maligning public employees. A number of persons have asked me about what my posture would be regarding the public sector and I have provided them with it. However, I reached the point when posting an article on the subject makes more sense than repeating the same formula over and over again.
Ecclesiastes is a book about king Solomon’s pursuit of the meaning of life. He went about his pursuit by experiencing every pleasure he could find, evaluating its significance to determine if it would help him uncover why we’re here and what is the point of our years on this earth. If we’re honest, most of us have asked ourselves the very question Solomon was asking back then: why are we here? What is the point of our life on earth?

“The new-born child does not realize that his body is more a part of himself than surrounding objects, and will play with his toes without any feeling that they belong to him more than the rattle by his side; and it is only by degrees, through pain, that he understands the fact of the body. And experiences of the same kind are necessary for the individual to become conscious of himself; but here there is the difference that, although everyone becomes equally conscious of his body as a separate and complete organism, everyone does not become equally conscious of himself as a complete and separate personality…. It is such that he, as little conscious of himself as the bee in a hive, who are lucky in life, for they have the best chance of happiness: their activities are shared by all, and their pleasures are only pleasures because they are enjoyed in common…. It is because of them that man has been called a social animal.”
When the CTD came up (underneath an incredible display of Aurora Australis southern lights), only the second blue bag, and the pair of panty hose that I strapped to the cage were visible at first. The first blue bag, the one with the majority of the student cups, was shredded to bits. Then, I saw Mike's tie line in the distance, and I noticed something swinging from the bottom of the CTD- it was the other pair of hose that had been INSIDE the blue bag that ripped!!! Somehow, it wrapped itself round the frame,

It’s worth understanding that when the trainees leave us, our work here still isn’t done. We remain close to them in order to ensure they receive the best in support and encouragement. They will no doubt fall upon tough times, as we all do, but this is actually the time when they’ll need to stay strong and focussed and these are times when they’ll need us most of all. I look at them now and know they believe the hard work is done but myself and my team know better. The hard work is about to begin. The difference now though is that they’re part of the CREATE family and we’ll make sure they make it.
Guess where my husband was on my birthday, while I was at home sick with two sick kids. He was at the Dallas Cowboys/Houston Texans game. Yep, he left me on my birthday while I was sick. I actually made him go. They were free tickets...you can't pass that up.

He left Facebook because he was going through one of his usual moods. Most likely he realized that some of the stuff he was posting was hurtful to me, and to Slut Girlfriend’s husband. His friends were pissing him off… his children were pissing him off….
All of the participants got a North Face shirt, visor and water bottle along with some bottles of accelerade and misc stuff in the goody bags. After the race the RD said there was a bunch of water and accelerade that they had left if we wanted to take any. Somehow John and I ended up bringing home 9 cases of water in sports bottles. 12 boxes of granola bars, 25 cases of accelerade and 6 cases of accel-gel, so we should be well stocked for a while even after giving some of that to Rick. Luckily John's Father in Law had his truck at the race to bring it all back home.

There is an old saying “those who can do, and those who can’t, teach.” I’m not sure where that phrase originated, but it is true in many professions. Think of professional sports; there are many great coaches who never played the game, or if they did, weren’t as good playing it as they are teaching and coaching it.

Reading fools that we are we have tackled History of the Medieval World as a read-aloud. It's History, right, but Susan Wise Bauer has such a conversational tone, dry wit and excellent way of presentation that it's story time. As "Booklist" states on the cover of the 700 + page tome, "She (Wise Bauer) writes briskly and interpretively, and is attuned throughout to the challenge of rulers: appearing to the ruled as legitimate holders of power." Flower, especially, has been a bit horrified at the lengths that some will go to to establish their divine right to rule. I appreciate Bauer's wit during such delicate tales.
What he doesn’t know is that I will be submitting the piece to the writers group next week. I wrote it so it will stand alone as a piece of sudden fiction.
But, here is the earliest school I can find, Ellinthorpe (see Marjorie R. Theobald's book, Knowing Women). The school was established in 1823 by a most intrepid woman, Hannah Maria Davice, who emigrated with a friend, Elinor Binfield, and a younger relative, Susannah Darke Purbrick in June, 1823. Hannah opened her school in rented buildings in Hobart Town within a month of arriving. She married George Carr Clark in December 1824 and continued to teach, changing locations to Carr Field House opposite the Post Office in Hobart, and then to Ellinthorpe in September 1827, described as a rural Victorian estate. Apparently, Lady Jane Franklin, wife of the Lieutenant Governor of Tasmania, was not too supportive, having educational projects of her own, but the Australian Dictionary of Biography reports Ellinthorpe was the most prestigious school in the colony, serving about 40 girls.

Derek is fighting a battle of his own. He’s convinced that he can save a girl’s life with a new but very risky brain surgery. If he does the operation the old fashioned way he can only get a small portion of the tumor which will relieve the symptoms but won’t cure her. He thinks if he takes a different approach he’ll be able to get all of it. The girl’s mother took the flight to Seattle from Chicago because he’s the best but at the same time she’s not convinced that this new technique can work and doesn’t want her daughter to be used as a guinea pig. Derek convinces the woman because the type of tumor the girl has might not be a death sentence but the kids who get it don’t have a particularly good outlook on life later on. He performs the surgery and removes the tumor successfully.

UPDATED 2/28/2012 ; I just heard Mitt Romney talk. He has said in the past it’s not the government’s job to creat jobs. That it is the economies job, and the market system. Today he said President Obama has done nothing to fix the economy, and that he would creat jobs in America. He can not have it both ways. Now which way is it Mr. Romney? He also said he will restore the Keystone pipeline. If I am correct, that oil will go in the pipeline from Canada onto boats right to China. America gets none of the oil, China has bout it already. He has the people who listen to him thinking the oil is for America. WAKE UP AMERICA!!!!

The BNPs very able female candidate in the recent Barnsley by-election had excellent chances of a high protest vote which the leaders destroyed by promoting to Yorkshire Organiser Ian Kitchen whose wife is a “granny-porn star” across the internet. This is supposed to be the party of family values. His deputy was former detective Simon Goodricke, who contested a ward in Barnsley in 2008. He was sacked from West Midlands Police and jailed for 18 months for perverting the course of justice and defrauding a pensioner of £1,000. He was found guilty at Birmingham Crown Court in 1998 after tipping off two businessmen who were attempting to swindle £100 million from Colombian drug barons. (3) I have no wish to attack people who have paid for their crimes but to show one of Griffin's methods of discrediting the party and preventing them being successful. Promoting people with bad pasts into the public eye whereby the media will use them to discredit the party and movement as a whole. That is a harsh fact of life.
For the past few days I’ve been thinking about my calling. I am a minister in transition – meaning that I am not serving on a church staff at the moment. Because I seem to have spent so much time “in transition,” it feels natural to question my calling. The hymnals that I grew up with don’t offer all the verses to this hymn – and that may be a shame. Which ones do you know?

The goal of every believer is to walk in the way of Christ, to emulate Him in everything we think, say and do. The way we treat people, the way we do our work, the way we spend our time – the way we do everything! – should show the world that we are followers of Jesus. Our lives should bear spiritual fruit, pointing people toward Christ and impacting the lives of others the way Jesus did when He was on the earth. This is a life that is fully pleasing to Him (v10).

When he sees her he says, "Happy Birthday Darcy" and she replies "Happy Birthday Brian" and then he gives her a hug or plays with her or whatever. Thanks for that Brian! :)

He passes out and wakes up in the woman's apartment. She asks him about his journals which she's been reading. She also asks why he fainted and he tells her lack of sunlight depleted him of vitamins C and E. She tells him that the bathroom door doesn't lock but warns him not to get any "bright ideas" before she visits the bathroom. He does however get a "bright idea." and rushes into the bathroom while she's on the toilet attempting to take her by force. He asks "Can fifteen years of imaginary training be put to use?" She hits him in the head with the handle of a knife she's holding, and he remarks "It can't." He starts getting ready to go and apologizes to her. She tells him she understands and she likes him. She tells him "You don't even know who I am, I'm Mi-do. You'll see. Later on, when I'm really ready, I swear that I will do it! I promise!" She tells him she knew there was something she liked about him from the moment she saw him and tells him the next time, even if she resists to go ahead and take her anyway.

I was so excited that I had to go ahead and post this at work. I just received an email from Melinda, our social worker, who has gotten the CAN forms back for Holmes and me…if you don’t remember, these are the forms that we were expecting to take months because of department cutbacks at the state (which I may have to quit calling Shaneyney now that they have pulled through for us). We are still waiting on the CAN form for Hisayo, but still I’m feeling really encouraged that we have at least an approval on one set of forms…hopefully, Hisayo’s won’t be but maybe a month behind ours. After Melinda receives Hisayo’s form, she will submit the home study for approval and then the review process will take about a week. After that, they will begin putting together the dossier to submit to China. So, it’s possible that by summer we will be looking at profiles! In other good news, Lifeline has notified everyone that they expect 3 new Lifeline sponsored orphanages to go online for adoption by late June/ early July (which hopefully will be right when we are finishing up our dossier). A team of experts from UAB went to visit these orphanages around mid-april and they are busy compiling all of the medical/ social information for these children into referral packets to be available by that June deadline. Since we are adopting special needs, we can be matched with a child even if our paperwork is not officially in China. In a regular adoption, you receive a login date from China and are put on a waiting list based on that date. For special needs, you can be matched as long as your dossier is expected to be in China within 6 months of your matched date.

SO, we ended up bailing on the W and, for lack of other plans or desire to throw away any more money on a cover charge, went to a very "local" bar and grill called The Casting Office that Eric, Corbin and I had gone to for dinner earlier that same day! It had a pretty cool atmosphere, cheap drinks, no cover charge, flat screens galore, and, best of all, NO LINE!! We ended up having a BLAST!! The bar owner passed out NYE party hats, noise makers, and confetti poppers just before midnight... and we played with them obnoxiously as if we were all 12 again! haha! We actually ended up being very pleased with our last minute venue selection...

I do not intend to write a tribute just to express the sadness I feel in her passing. I was surprised at my thoughts turning often to her. I tried to read the articles about her death but could not.

The Barnes & Noble deal brings into relief a web strategy that, for Microsoft, is peculiar.

Its online-services division has made a total of $6.9 billion in revenue in the past three fiscal years and posted an aggregate operating loss of $6.5 billion.

It becomes a ritual, a familiar moment in every introduction. We trade our San Francisco origin stories along with our names and neighborhoods. We draw out the paths that led us here. Even the ones who have been here all along, the ones born near the bay, can tell a story about leaving and returning, or the moment they knew they couldn't go.

With Love From My Heart,
When I first met Jason, in March of 2006, he and his wife were running a research trapping operation, living in a remote cabin in Sunlight Basin, Wyoming, with their two-year-old daughter. Kate, his wife, was eight months pregnant; on the day I met her she told me she was headed out to ski up a pass to look the carcass of a skinned mountain lion that some hunters had killed the day before. ‘Intimidated’ doesn’t begin to describe the feeling that this family evoked. I thought they were crazily obsessed. But within six months I was paying my own tithes to the quest for wolverine data – I became so sick on my first wolverine trek that I could hardly walk, and spent a night on the cold ground in the middle of the wilderness at 11,000 feet – and finding myself in a truck laden with capture supplies, driving through a snowstorm along deserted roads at 2:00 in the morning, seemed a natural evolution. Once you’re hooked, you’re really hooked.
The whole project took me a few hours - spread out over a few days - and cost only $45 - for the hardwood boards I used to build my table. Now, every time I walk in to feed the pets or do laundry, the space just makes me feel good. Gotta love results like that. And now my overnight guests don't have to see a mess when they walk to their bathroom.

Inside the snug bakery, a couple Formica tables give you a place to sit and inhale luscious baking smells. Key-lime pie, blueberry muffins, snickerdoodles, caramel pecan cheesecake and, of course, cupcakes in myriad flavors are all on the menu to tempt you. But to save you from waffling in indecision, go for the best cake in the house.
It's the season for recipe testing! I'm also testing for Terry Hope Romero's upcoming international vegan cookbook. It's a delicious job, let me tell you. Doing all of this testing for Terry and Sara Beth have really put me on a mission. It's so much fun trying new things. I've been inspired by different techniques and flavor combinations and will definitely carry some of that over into my own recipes.

If you have a Silhouette SD to cut out animal silhouettes, use that. You can also download clip arts online and print, trace and cut by hand. If you have a friend that owns a Silhouette...kindly ask if they can help you cut the fabric because this project is so easy and addicting to make.
At the other end of the scale, I caught the train to Thornbury to see a play in a backyard shed. It was Summertime in the Garden of Eden, the latest offering from Declan Greene and Ash Flander's queer theatre collective, Sisters Grimm. This was, in its own way, as remarkable as The Wild Duck. Both shows, in completely different ways, demonstrate how little (and how much) it takes to make compelling theatre: you can make it with almost nothing, if you invite the imagination of the audience in to open up its dark and tender places. It's the one thing theatre can't fake, and no amount of plush can cover its absence.
Feliz Cinco de Mayo to all my readers who will be celebrating this week :)

That night was especially beautiful—the dusk was mid-summer long, and the trees were throwing plum-colored shadows all over the yard and the pool. We lit some lanterns with candles and hung them around our back porch, and we all sat out on our deck—you had your feet in our pool.

Getting a break from everything has nothing to do with anybody else. It has everything to do with me, and my focus. My first parents could be in my life or not, but I’m still going to think about them. The first twenty or so years of my life are proof of that. I know more now than I did back then, but it’s more of the same even after they aren’t in my life anymore. I will always think about them, wonder what they are doing, and hope that they remember me at some point or another. Being the outsider is hard.
Tomorrow, in Manchester, as well as electing a third of the council, the city has an opportunity to say whether or not it wants a Mayor. As a natural democrat, my instinct is always to support anything that improves choice, and makes up for this country's appalling democratic deficit - and will certainly vote tomorrow. However, the mayoral election has put me in a bit of a quandary.

Can’t help but wonder if we are ever going to get there?? Can we get pregnant again on our own? Can I stay pregnant? Would we have a successful FET? All questions that I know have no answers at this point. That I know I need to be patient, to relax, to belief that it is going to happen for us, to have faith… It’s just hard at this point, and I’m wondering how does anyone do it?
The good thing about me and Scot is no uneasy silence. Chat or quiet, it's all good, though we spent the better part of two days together and there was very little quiet. Once I was back in business we wandered down to the Suites at Market Square and after the back-and-forth back-and-forth of the vendors we skipped up three steps to see the antique dealers.

And on that note, I'm sad to report that I'm going bald again. Ok, so maybe I'm not going bald, but I'm losing a LOT of hair, just as I did post partum with Cameron. It's noticeable, and well, it sucks. I suppose that's what I get since I didn't have an ounce of morning sickness, eh?
Anyway, what I do know is that he is roughly getting only about 20% special education help; mostly in language and social/emotional areas. This is good. Right? I think? Occupational therapy is basically being reduced to only a consultative basis, which is reasonable at this point.

In closing, I will tell you one last lesson we can learn from Jack’s life. I believe that Jack’s ability to find joy was a gift given to him by his parents. There is no parent on Earth who loves his or her child more than Tim and Anna love Jack and Margaret. Not a day of Jack’s life passed that they failed to tell him how much they loved him, how proud they were to be his parents. There is no child who felt more secure in his parents love than Jack did. He was taken from us too early, but somehow Anna and Tim filled a lifetime of love into Jack’s twelve years.

They came quickly, First from the left. Milligan and I were both shooting. I saw two men fall, then they came from the right. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Milligan turn and run toward the cliff. Three men were approaching quickly, I fired and two went down, I pulled the trigger again and nothing happened. I was out of bullets. This was it, now or never.Time moved slowly, there was shooting from behind and something buzzed passed my head. The open space in front of me grew larger and larger. I wondered what had happened to ole Jakes. I was falling through the air ,the muddy water comming up at me fast. It was no longer inviting.

Luggage and bags – Keeping track of your stuff is tough enough when you travel, but Paris is notorious for pick pockets and purse snatchers, so arrange your attire so you carry your valuables close to your body and just have purses and bags to carry incidental items. Simple but sturdy luggage with locking zippers is the best idea; anything too flashy just makes a juicy target.

After this weekend I began to rethink these advances we are moving and striving towards. Although I love technology is it going beyond the grasps of the common people? Will I need to have an engineering degree before I can continue with my passion of working on cars? I feel as though technology IS advancing towards a better and more easier future for us, but what is it really taking away from us?
The cattle theft unit of the SA Police Service was called in and repaired the water pipes so the cattle could drink. After that the new owners simply disappeared and the animals were again left to their own devices. People in the area told us they cannot live near people like the new owners. “How can we share the same planet with them? What do we have in common with human beings who treat their very own animals in such a way? There is absolutely no compassion whatsoever in their hearts for anything. They are selfish, lazy and uncaring. How can the government use taxpayers’ money to give a beautiful farm to people like that?”

But the language isn't just awesome when describing the zombies and horror; there is also the everyday joys. Mary falls in love with one boy; yet it's his brother who loves her. "It's a warm day and he's sweating and I press my mouth against his skin, tasting his salt on my lips. I want to melt into him, to forget every barrier between us and it is everything I can do to suck in air and sit here and not press myself harder against him. He's not mine but Cass's and I know I should turn away, leave this place. But I am not strong enough to do so. Just this last time I want to revel in his essence, to wrap it around me like a memory."

Do: Meet quickly with the grieving family. This will help you as well as the family that has experienced the loss. It will help you as a pastor to know them and bond with them on a level that you would not otherwise have. It will also allow you to minister more directly to their hearts since all pretenses are usually gone. It will also help you to get a feel for the person who has passed away. I found this especially helpful since I didn’t know the man at all. In my context the pastor delivers the eulogies so knowing the person who has passed away is especially important. This will also help the family through the grieving process. After a family member has died those

The word you are looking for is ‘Zionist’. Lets not mix the jews with Zionists because not all jews are Zionists. Thats the same as calling every single Arab a terrorist. You dont have to be a jew to support Zionism. The shah of Iran back in the day was one of the major supporters of Zionists. Zionists successfully occupied the palestinian territory and they killed thousands in Lebanon without a real reason. This video explains to you the truth about Zionists and how they control the main media stations around the world.
I’m also reading Normal People Don’t Live Like This, a collection of short stories by Dylan Landis, whom I met at a party recently. (This is not to imply that I read only books by people I’ve eaten with, but the message for writers should be clear—if you want to sell a few extra copies of your latest opus, chat up the person next to you at dinner.) I started my career as a short story writer, and I still try to keep up with the genre when I can. And Landis’s stories offer a fascinating glimpse into the truly strange minds of adolescent girls, in prose that’s sharp and often surprising.Visit Gary Krist's website.

The unexceeded way to hit those kinds of prospects is to aspect around for the change groups that this specific business or manufacture would belong to. Go to their meetings and conferences, and see out a array in their topical expos. Prettify busy so you can be a panelist on something technology-related or indite an article for one of their manufacture publications. The key here is to get referrals.
My excuse? Good, old-fashioned rest. I'm not trying to please the blogger world. I'm not going to come up with some masterpiece of words to distract you from the fact that I'm human. Because that bugs me terribly when I hear it from other bloggers sometimes.
Green Turtle Cay–most of the archipelago, in fact—over 700 islands and cays scattered for 500 miles southeast of Florida—was still free of industrial development. That in itself was a miracle. Locals still made a living off catching Bahamian lobster, red snapper and delicious conch. Conch salad was her favorite: chunks of flesh from these succulent shellfish toasted or deep fried with a stunning dressing of hot peppers, garlic and limes. She licked her lips unconsciously, remembering the flavors.
It was a great format, I think we were both able to bring up things we wanted to discuss and feel like we were heard. Mike brought up refinancing and instead of shooting it down, I listened and we went ahead with it! I brought up trading in his truck for a more fuel-efficient vehicle but he made some good point and we'll be keeping it a while longer.

Even great psychiatrists,great psychoanalysts become in a way very hopeless about humanity..even Freud.After a whole life’s experience he finally said that he could not hope for man;he felt hopeless.And it is natural-forty years of being with people who are in a mess;the only experience of humanity being of people who are mad.By and by it started to look to him as if abnormality is normal..as if man is bound to remain neurotic,as if there is something natural in man which drives him towards neurosis.

“The disposal of assets of State bodies or the granting of access to property or infrastructure for commercial arrangements e.g. joint ventures with third parties, with an anticipated value at or above a threshold level of €150,000 should be by auction or competitive tendering process, other than in exceptional circumstances (such as a sale to a charitable body). The method used should be both transparent and likely to achieve a fair market-related price. The anticipated value may be determined either by a reserve price recorded in advance in the State body’s records or by a formal sign-off by the Board on the advice of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or, if delegated by the Board, sign-off by the CFO or the Board Audit Committee, that, in its view, the anticipated value is likely to be less or greater than €150,000. In determining market value, regard should be had to accounting standards best practice in Ireland.”

N-Data settled the charges and was placed under a consent order prohibiting it from enforcing the patents unless it has first offered the patent license attached to the order. Specifically, N-Data must offer a paid-up, royalty-free license to the Relevant Patents in the Licensed Field of Use in exchange for a one-time fee of $1,000. However, if an offeree has failed to accept such an offer within 120 days, the Proposed Consent Order allows N-Data to sue to enforce the Relevant Patents. At the time N-Data files suit, however, it must make a second offer providing a prospective licensee with an opportunity to accept the patent license specified by the order in return for a payment of thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000).

John tells us that because “the kingdom of heaven has come near” it is time to repent. The word “repent” is often defined as being sorry for our sins and changing our behavior accordingly. It is certainly true that in order to prepare our hearts for the Lord, a primary starting point is to become honest with God about our sin and to agree with Him that our only deliverance is through Christ. But that’s not the end of the story.

This is not just academic speculation. The non-Muslim world can be aided significantly in its understanding of the global jihad threat -- an understanding that has been notably lacking even at the highest levels since September 11, 2001 -- by a careful, unbiased examination of the origins of Islam. There is a great deal of debate today in the United States and Western Europe about the nature of Islamic law; anti-sharia measures have been proposed in at least twenty states, and one state -- Oklahoma -- voted to ban sharia in November 2010, although that law was quickly overturned as an infringement upon Muslims' religious freedom. Others have been successfully resisted on the same grounds.
“I was interested in what some people might say was a woman of no consequence on a day of no importance engaged in an act of no significance,” he said. “I was really interested in what it would look like to think about that as a historic piece of information. I very consciously tried not to endow her with the traditional things that would make it worth watching her and to see if I could make her interesting enough and the workings of her mind interesting enough that the fact that this isn’t a do or die day, it’s just a day, would matter.”

But the US could not stay alone in its corner of the world forever.

Gordon worked at a track for years, so maybe she is writing what she saw. Yet it was foreign to me. Maybe while I’m deciding whether to bet the 4 or the 9, there’s some girl in the shedrows having sex with her horse’s owner. Maybe she’s also trying to figure out how to get her ancient but legendary and mystical horse to win a race after a long draught. Maybe she has captured the hearts of the old railbirds that have been hanging around the track for years. And maybe she’s figured out a way to outwit the Mafioso types that supposedly wield the real power at the track. Maybe it’s all true. But I don’t think so.
I don’t think anybody will ever understand the undying love I have for this book. It fills me with exuberance.

Looking back on it now, I never would have thought that such a simple premise would work so well. Ninety’s childhood at it’s motherfucking finest.

Judge Jackie Hatcher will rule on Fox's request June 3rd. We're predicting the Florence man won't receive that coveted designation. The Colbert County District Attorney's office is opposed to the request, especially in such a high profile crime.

On to Goodletsville…we hit the jackpot; a quilt shop sandwiched between 2 antique malls. The quilt shop was closed on Mondays, but the owner saw us looking in and opened her door. The shop was delightful; lots of civil war fabrics downstairs and spacious classroom and quilt gallery upstairs with great natural lighting. The first antique mall was full, but nothing of interest to Arna or me. The second, however, yielded a service for 8 of 1847 Rogers IS silver which looked almost brand new. It was housed in a wonderful odd box. It was a find for $30. Arna grabbed it up.

This started to remind me of how much my life had changed from those days. How when I moved to Seattle my world fell apart: my “family” went away, I experienced the “crisis of faith”, my friends disappeared, the confidence I once oozed out of my pores had evaporated from my soul, and I couldn’t build new real friendships in this strange silly place. Who would have thought a simple move 3 hours north of my whole WORLD, would have brought such chaos and disaster into my emotional, social, spiritual, and physical life. But it did. And the consequences are still ever-present in my life today.

I think God is breaking my heart for my future. The love from these children is amazing- praying for us as “Mummy and Daddy.” What a blessing to sponsor these little angels.

Driving today is stressful. There are lots of things we need to contend with: traffic jams, accidents, poor/no signage, changed signage and my all-time favorite, people talking and texting on their cell phones. So what does this mean for you? Well, here are my top reasons for why you should invest in a GPS:

It wasn’t easy to peek in the window this morning and glimpse signs of demolition inside what we had long thought of as “our” Mirror. I’ll do my best to accept whatever arises next in that space, once brightened by a wall of mirrors and the laughter of so many friends. I imagine that whenever I first darken the door of the new place, a number of ghosts will crowd into the doorway along with me and pull up a nearby barstool: Holly will be there, telling the story once more of the big, scary woman who smashed her face into the bar and drawled, “I can sprang on somebody real fast;” Judge Jerry will bang his shoe on the bar again, in his now famous Khrushchev impression; Mike D. will retell the one about the drunk guy, the urinal, and an offer Mike could refuse; Old Man Bob will converse at length with me about the more obscure nonfiction of George Orwell and the labyrinthine politics of the Spanish Civil War (and then will let loose that marvelous, braying laugh of his); and Sailor Bob will, again, tell a fascinating but convoluted tale we can’t quite follow, something to do with conspiracy on the high seas.
Here's a few reasons why...
I would see my friends all around,
It makes me feel better to eat fattening foods that are minus additives/preservatives!!
I love the internet. Sat on my fat arse, I can suck the world's information down almost as quickly as my St. Bernardus Abt. (Yes, thanks, don't mind if I do.) That and those old-fashioned papery things. Books, I think they used to call them. The one map did come from one of those. The beautiful OS map, on the other hand, is an internet find. If only they'd included Streetview.

Recently, Patrick Henningsen, the editor of 21st Century Wire, penned a commentary, “The Great Collapse of the Chicago Climate Exchange”, an excellent analysis of how the bottom fell out of the scheme to buy, sell, and trade “carbon credits” based on the fraudulent claim that “greenhouse gas emissions” had to be reduced worldwide to avoid global warming.

There’s an interesting twist, too — when characters speak, Dan can respond to them either by using a simple multiple-choice system or by actually speaking his response into a gimmicky voice-recognition system which I switched off almost immediately. (When your voice-recognition system picks up gunfire from the game and thinks you’re saying the word “fuck”, you have a problem, as entertaining as that might sound.) Dan’s responses will affect the other characters’ “trust level” with him, with them being more likely to successfully follow his orders if they trust him more. I’m guessing there will be some sort of story payoff for high trust levels, too, though I’m not far enough into the game to say with certainty yet.

Our Kentucky Derby entree was Kentucky Hot Browns and they were just delicious. Thank goodness Barb helped me with it because it was a 2-person job if you are serving these at a gathering (as opposed to your family for dinner). The recipe was again found thru Pinterest and came from My Recipes and they found it at Southern Living. You can get the recipe by clicking here. Note - we only added 2 1/2 C. of milk to the Mornay Sauce (it called for 3 1/2). Again, get this recipe and make it for your family -- it was that good --

Another exciting arrival this week was our new RSPB membership pack. We had somehow managed to stop being members after moving banks and forgetting all about the direct debit. We had a phone call from them last week and renewed our membership straight away. What we didn't realise, was that in doing so, we would also end up receiving their new members pack again! Last time we became new members, Tabitha was too young to appreciate the members stuff. This time she was delighted!

By contrast, the "right-wing, knuckle-dragging mouth breathers" at Fox News' headline read "Anti-abortion Protesters March in Washington on Roe v.

After a rather discouraging first attempt at hand-quilting, I am happy to report that I am back in the saddle! For the last several months, my quilt has sat folded up in the basement, lonely and untouched, sporting only a few pitiful lines of too big, uneven stitches. I had even started machine quilting a second quilt, and decided that hand quilting just wasn't for me. The process was just too overwhelming. I had all but given up.
Then everything changed. We moved. Our new yard is way smaller. The back yard is maybe ¼ the size of our old yard and half of that is taken up by a pool. But there is so much more excitement—and Purpose.

Until somewhat recently, however, the idea of going out for high-end tempura (and paying upwards of Y10,000 for it) seemed a little silly to me. I have since changed my tune. As many of my compatriots can attest, deep-frying has the ability to make almost anything more appetizing, but frying with skill and precision multiplies the delicious factor by at least one power of ten. Take, for example, the shrimp heads served at the start of our meal at Motoyoshi.

my talk is just idle chatter.
I originally wanted to live in Canjayar, and to be part of the community. It was somewhat of a controversial subject among the teachers at my school. Some of them sat me down, and asked me whether I wanted to live in Canjayar or Almeria. When I said I wanted to live in Canjayar they said I was crazy because it is boring and there is nothing to do. They said maybe you can meet someone for a drink or something in the few bars and restaurants that exist, but that is it. All I heard was how incredibly boring Canjayar is, and how in Almeria there is a lot more to do, and a lot more life. I would say well what am I going to do in Almeria? Party all night or go to museums everyday? If I stay in Almeria I will have to commute every day to Canjayar and sometimes I do not start classes until noon, and the other days it is at various times in the morning. I want to give private lessons it would be convenient to do them in the afternoons, to the students I already know from the school. But maybe there would be more opportunities to do this in Almeria, maybe I could charge more. I thought about trying to find an apartment to live during the majority of the time in Canjayar, and then find some place in Almeria where I can just crash on the weekend.

She gave me a small, hand-size three ring binder. This notebook contain a monthly grid of individual sheets of the customers I was to deliver the newspapers too. Each sheet had the customers’ address and which paper was to be delivered to them. There was also an amount listing what I was to collect from the customer once a week. She turned over this binder of customers’ names and addresses to me. At ten years old I had my first Real Job. I now had responsibility. I felt grown up. It felt good.

Patristic thought takes up this economy of truth, and puts out of bounds as unnatural any inquiry which leads neither to salvation or any practical application. These restrictions on theoretical curiosity lent an air of the forbidden and unnatural to the pursuit of new research. With truth robbed of its naturalness, an explicit consciousness of method involved in acquiring truth comes to the fore.

(large pdf, p. 16) offered a statewide assessment that mostly jibes with Harris County's juvie crime drop: "In fiscal year 2011, there were 79,732 formal referrals to juvenile probation departments throughout the state. This represented an 11% decrease in referrals from the previous year (89,419 formal referrals in fiscal year 2010)." In 2001, according TJPC (see this report [pdf]), statewide juvenile referrals totaled more than 113,000, so we're talking about a significant drop in juvie crime over the last decade, even as the state's population ballooned.

Related to Tip Two, I’ve found that I can easily pre-order cuts of meat, types of cheese, seafood, eggs and large amounts of produce (like strawberries for jam) and pick them up at my local farmer’s market. Farmer’s like this because they know they are bringing items to market that will be sold. And I love it because I don’t have to get to the market only to find out that no one has any chicken breasts left.

The symptoms of chronic sinus infection, as mentioned earlier, are more or less the same as of acute sinusitis, the only difference being that they last for a longer duration. These include pain around the eyes and the nose, severe headache, pain in the jaws, a thick yellowish discharge from the nose, cough and, in some cases, fever.

Hello! So sorry I have'nt been in blogland for a good while but I have taken up an old hobby and will share pics soon :) but until then I thought I'd share the card that got me a runners up prize of $25 worth of Nitwit collections downloads in issue 96 of Simply Cards & Papercraft(I'm on page 23). I was chuffed to bits when I got the email saying I was a runner up and had my youngest sons help deciding which collections to choose because I loved them all lol. The paper's are LUSH!

Veronica recalls being pregnant with Sarah. She was 40 and the doctors considered her to be a high risk because of her age. They tried to persuade her to have a termination because of the risks but she refused. The pregnancy was difficult. She had mobility problems. She was admitted to hospital almost a month before her due date because she had high blood pressure. Complications developed during the delivery and Sarah had to be delivered by C-section. Veronica adored her from the moment she was born. She was tiny. She named her Sarah after her favourite singer, Sarah McLachlan. Her song Answer has special significance for Veronica and her husband. The song was on a compilation CD he gave her when they were dating, they danced to it at their wedding and it was playing the night Sarah was conceived.

This argument surely applies to local government and it would be regrettable were Mr Mackay's freeze to lead to our councils degenerating into a morass of the unemployed and unemployable especially as strong and wise leadership will be required to steer councils through the difficult times ahead.
Of course I’d dismiss these feelings if I were in desolation. Guess what. I’m not in desolation. Apparently, according to my spiritual director, I’m in a low-grade consolation based on my calm and strong confidence that God will lead me down the right path while not being necessarily ecstatic about it. I’ve been faithful to my prayer life every day, and I’ve started doing novenas in order to help my discernment process (St. Therese, pray for me. Please ask her intercession in my prayer life). I’d say I’m growing, and my spiritual director said that the questions I’m asking are valid and all good questions and that I seriously need to discern the type of love that God showed me that I need to find, if that makes any sense.

Nephi hesitated because he knows that whoever commits violence also brings the curse of violence back on himself. It is because Nephi killed Laban that Laman and Lemuel later attempted to kill Nephi: if Laban had given Nephi the plates, Nephi would never have been subjected to his brothers' violence. Thus, a share of the accountability for all the violence among the Nephites lies forever with Laban.

It is clear in “The Departed” that Costello, although he is a mob boss, acts as a father figure to both characters, as well as Queenan is to Costigan. However, it is evident that Costello’s aims and desires for both characters only benefit his organization while Queenan has a right-mind to not only put Costello into prison, but also to protect Costigan. Police corruption is perhaps the main theme of the screenplay, and coincides well with the concept of identity. Both Costigan and Sullivan must maintain their false identities, but must also make sure it does not get to them. Not only is this picture a wonderful thriller full of action, it also reflects on the idea of police corruption, a father-son relationship, and the idea of identity.

In it we follow Spencer Quinn and his best friend Frankie after Spencer’s twin brother, Oliver, is mysteriously kidnapped. The story begins when his mother moves Spencer to a small town in the country to live with his grandmother, away from the furor of media attention. Here, Spencer is burdened with starting a new school, bullies, the loss of a sibling, a depressed mother and a stranger who seems to know everything about him. Spencer and Frankie go on an epic journey, both physical and emotional, to find Oliver. There are no clues, no witnesses and no body. Nothing! Except a phenomenon Spencer believes is an illness.
Every time my life gets threatened, I know it must be Tuesday. You people may have been able to make David Wilcock cry and weep in fear, but four leaf clovers cover me from head to toe, laddies, and the Daughters of the Phoenix stand in front of me, the accomplished 505 behind me, the angels of the seven sisters above me, and the bones of the wicked crunch under my feet.
In contrast, the top-down sweep is that in which the police attempt to gain insight into who committed a crime by determining those who might have had reason and/or opportunity to do so. It is less physical and more human than the bottom-up approach, relying as it does on such things as familiarity with known criminals in a given area and the details of their criminal ways, interviews with the loved ones of murder victims to try to elicit information as to the likely killers, and using informers to gain access to the word on the street after a bank robbery. Thus, the top-down approach scans in the opposite direction from the bottom-up approach, sifting the entire population under suspicion in a different fashion. It does not directly generate evidence of anything; rather, it helps focus the bottom-up sweep on those investigative areas and/or targets where its efforts will be best spent, and allows bottom-up evidence such as fingerprint evidence to be checked against specific suspects.
