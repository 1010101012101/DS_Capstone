In recent years, the United Nations has enunciated a doctrine known as "responsibility to protect," which postulates that the world community shares a responsibility to defend populations from atrocities such as genocide, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. We agree, but what's happening in Syria doesn't rise to the level of genocide. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said this week that Assad fits the definition of a war criminal, and others have argued that he is committing crimes against humanity. Our view is that the international community has a moral responsibility to work urgently to end the violence in Syria, but we do not believe it has reached the point at which military intervention is justified.

Questions about McCain's judgment in recent days have only been deepened by the performances of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. She has struggled in her rare public appearances, and her selection risks appearing all the more reckless and cynical when held against the seriousness of this financial crisis. Even McCain's campaign "suspension" seemed like gamesmanship. He said he was rushing to Washington, but took his time, and the talks derailed soon after he arrived.

The best way to describe "Potiche" is breezy. It's a film so light that it might float off the screen and drift into the next theater. Ozon must have taken a happy pill.
"We're still thanking our residents," Superintendent Maureen Clancy-May said. "We have to watch the budget, but we definitely have some breathing room now. Most of all, we don't want to sacrifice the quality of the students' education."
Truth be told, biblical scholars agree that the "honey" of the Bible was not made by bees but from dates, figs, carob or grapes. To make date, fig or carob honey, the fruit was soaked in water until fully softened and then cooked down to a thick syrup. Date and grape honeys were the most popular, followed by fig honey. Carob honey held last place because of its distinctive aroma. You can find updated versions of these venerable sweeteners on a visit to a health food or Middle Eastern store. Just avoid any that contain added sugar.

The law requires the president to issue a proclamation for the National Day of Prayer every year. "I invite all citizens of our nation, as their own faith or conscience directs them, to join me in giving thanks for the many blessings we enjoy," President Obama said in his proclamation last year.

Even a better-paying gig couldn't keep up with the hospital bills for her diabetic crises. Scarce funds forced her to bypass her meds to meet her kids' needs. Her husband's on-the-job accident in 2010 only hastened the rising red tide.
The so-called stand your ground law asserts that a person has no duty to retreat when facing an attacker and has a right to use deadly force if he "reasonably" believes he or others are threatened with death or great bodily harm. It also grants "true immunity" from civil and criminal charges. This means a judge can use this law to dismiss a case before it goes to trial, and also that Florida prosecutors are less likely to pursue homicide cases against people who claim they acted in self-defense. The St. PetersburgTimes performed a search of Florida newspapers and turned up 93 cases in which the law could have been applied from 2005 to 2010, and found that 57 of them never went to trial.
Ripples from the choirs travel far. In 2009, the American Choral Directors Association invited the Pacific Youth Choir to sing at its 50th anniversary convention in Oklahoma City. The invitation was the equivalent of a youth soccer team going to the nationals.

A: The culprit that is attacking your healthy broad-leaved agaves is the agave snout weevil. It is especially attracted to Agave Americana or Agave weberi. The beetles lay their eggs in early April. The females chew their way through the base -- often between leaf attachments -- leaving behind bacteria and laying the eggs. The larvae eat into the rotting heart of the agave. Often an infestation won't appear until the damage has been done. Suddenly, most of the leaves will collapse, leaving only the center terminal bud. Remove the infested plant and periodically treat any new agaves you plant in the spring. Your nursery or garden center can guide you to the best product for the job.
The tsunami disrupted the electrical grid that supplied power to the pumps that circulated cooling water at 11 reactors shut down in the quake area. But at six of those reactors, water from the tsunami also damaged the diesel generators that supplied backup power. The facilities had to rely on batteries, which had a life of only several hours.

-- Orbitz comes closest: If you buy a ticket, and someone else buys the same exact itinerary for a lower price on Orbitz, Orbitz refunds the difference in cash. The cash refund is a big plus; the big minus is that you get the refund only if someone else buys the same exact ticket through Orbitz at a lower price. Orbitz's program applies to hotels as well as airfares.

Cover with marinade and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Thirty minutes before cooking, remove from marinade, shake off excess and season with salt and pepper.
The Browns have been hit hard by injuries at key positions in recent years, or else fans would never have had to watch Ken Dorsey play quarterback. There will be more of that league-wide this season because of the new Collective Bargaining Agreement's ban on two-a-day workouts during training camp. Two-a-days were difficult because they were supposed to be. They inured players to the early-season heat and increased conditioning.
Then, while thumbing through a magazine at a friend's house, he saw an advertisement for a lender called Chicago Homestart Services.

Hey, Tony: With everything seemingly working against them: new head coach, new offense, new defense, and the lockout, I was rather encouraged by the play of the Browns. They are by no means perfect, but they do actually look like they belong on a football field. How encouraged are you thus far? Secondly, what do you make of the apparent lack of interest league wide, and especially in Cleveland, in Lofa Tatupu? Is he injured or something? The guy is a talented LB, surprised to see him still available. -- Matthew Yoder, Newark, Del.
-- The airline's primary focus was on premium-class travelers -- sill the case with today's big lines -- where travelers received lavish meals and endless drinks. At that time, first-class cabins were large; conventional industry thinking was that almost all business travelers would fly up front, with economy relegated to leisure travelers and those visiting family. The main difference is that today's international first class is even more luxurious than it was in the 1960s.

And though Clinton couched his criticism in the narrow terms of politics, intolerance of opposing points of view is a bipartisan, gender-neutral, race-blind, multigenerational pastime simply because we are a society that demands our personal preferences be catered to at all times.

"The overarching theme throughout (a plaintiff filing) is the inadequacy of TSA's ... procedures to have plaintiffs' names removed from any No Fly List," Brown wrote, "and not the placement of their names on such list, which is the only basis for district court jurisdiction."
Since the law was passed, it's been clear that it was both mean-spirited and likely to lead to racial profiling and discrimination. But it is also a clear preemption of federal power. For example, SB 1070 requires that police check the immigration status of anyone they stop in the course of their work and whom they suspect of being in the country illegally, even those pulled over for routine traffic violations. If that person can't provide documentation, he or she may be detained. The law also authorizes police, who have received no training in the complexities of immigration law, to carry out arrests without warrants if they suspect that an individual has committed a deportable offense. The problem is that Arizona doesn't have the authority or ability to make deportation determinations. That burden would ultimately fall to federal officials, who would be forced to shift resources from their top priority — deporting immigrants with criminal records — in order to deal with people who have been detained merely because they are suspected of being here illegally. That hardly makes for the kind of sensible "cooperation" between state and federal law officers that has been authorized by Congress.
Two years and two controversial police shootings later, the consultant's warnings about public distrust seem prescient. Anybody who pays attention has a pretty firm idea of what a bad, sluggish or incomplete investigation looks like.

On the energy front, the Western Hemisphere needs to establish itself as a democratic, peaceful and stable alternative to the Middle East in global energy production.

One other point: When faced with budget cuts, school districts and their unions routinely claim they have no choice but to lay off teachers and increase class sizes. Not true. If, as they often declare, "it's for the children," there's another obvious option. The unions, theoretically, are collegial collectives. But union contracts mandate that layoffs be based on seniority, not performance. So young and enthusiastic teachers are the first to go, regardless of talent, while those with seniority, even if they're burned out and ineffective, are protected. Instead of heartlessly firing anyone, why not share the burden? All could keep their jobs and class sizes could remain the same if the payroll shortfall were collectively distributed. A very small pay cut across the entire population could preclude the layoff of any.

Director Ashley Hollingshead has incorporated dance and movement throughout, during, before and after narrative and short scene sketches that seamlessly press the action along. The symmetry and diversity of four bodies can create a sense of mechanization one minute, unbounded freedom and hope the next (a joyous segment of '60s dances) and utter despair in another, as actors literally reach out for something--the meaning of life, perhaps, or maybe just basic human needs.

But, as the GM said, “the Cardinals are a good organization.” St. Louis has a winning culture that has survived the exits of La Russa and Pujols. And the front office has found answers. They used money not spent on Pujols — so much more vital to Cardinal history than Reyes is to the Mets’ lore — to extend catcher Yadier Molina, re-up first baseman Lance Berkman and shortstop Rafael Furcal and import right fielder Carlos Beltran. Their farm system has delivered, among others, David Freese, Jon Jay, Jason Motte and Lance Lynn, whose spectacular transition from the pen to the rotation has helped the Cardinals compensate for Carpenter’s absence and Wainwright’s early struggles.

But for all the tough talk, Santorum's once-fiery presidential bid went out like a candle Tuesday here in his home state. His campaign, always a shoestring operation, spent its final day in disarray.

Several of Santorum's supporters showed up at his morning event at a sportsman's club in Bedford, Pa., but found not so much as a Santorum sign.

3: Points Oregon’s defense allowed against ASU in the second half after Bennett entered the game. Much has been made of Bennett “leading” the Ducks from behind in a 41-27 win over Arizona State after Thomas left with a knee injury. But let’s take a closer look. Oregon led 21-17 at halftime and trailed 24-21 when Thomas exited the game. It’s not as if Thomas threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown resulting in Oregon falling behind. It was the Ducks’ defense surrendered those 24 points. To that point, Thomas was 13 of 17 for 187 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions, a stat line forgotten by most. After Bennett entered the game, UO’s defense began to take over the contest and held the Sun Devils to three points the rest of the way. Bennett did some nice things, but he did not produce a touchdown himself and completed just 2 of 5 passes for 22 yards. He did rush for 65 on five carries and is clearly the better runner of the two. But do the math: Thomas produced 203 yards of offense in just over two quarters and directly got the Ducks into the end zone twice. Bennett produced 87 yards of offense in less than two quarters and didn’t get the ball into the end zone in any way himself. The best quarterback that day was Thomas, by a mile, and he can’t control the play of Oregon's defense. Finally, must I recount how many times Thomas has led the Ducks to great second-half performances?

"What attracted me to Simon's stories was how unlike anyone else's they were, how full of life," Gaiman wrote in 2010 in a foreword to "The Simon & Kirby Superheroes" collection from Titan Books. "He created strange villains, part cartoon, part caricature, part embodiment of whatever he wished to talk about. While the trends in comics were toward realism in writing, Joe Simon marched in the other direction, creating his own reality.... The oddness of Joe Simon's work is where it gets its power."

It's easy  justifiably so  to beat up on Stockton for spending itself into a fiscal hole so deep that bankruptcy may be its only course.
"A regulator would have shut down the Wright Brothers for their ‘dust pollution,' Romney said, getting a chuckle. "And the government would have banned Thomas Edison's light bulb. Oh yeah, Obama's regulators actually did just that," he said to applause - though the origins to the light bulb ban Romney mentioned were in the Bush - not Obama White House.
It underscores the differences in tone adopted by the brassier Channel 19 and the more traditional Channel 3, but Bill Applegate, WOIO/WUAB's vice President and general manager, believes Robinson will fit right in.

St. Louis Circuit Judge John Garvey last month sided with Tamara Favazza in her suit against Mantra Films Inc. and MRA Holdings LLC, awarding her $5.77 million. She was a 20-year-old college student in 2005 when someone lifted her tank top during a party at a St. Louis bar, exposing her breasts. Another person filmed it. She later discovered the recording was part of the "Girls Gone Wild Sorority Orgy" DVD series.
The first passengers should step on FasTracks-funded trains in about two years. While the promise of FasTracks has some big fans in Denver among commuters and employers, its failings regarding cost and timetable also offer harsh lessons, which Georgia officials are trying to heed.
The movie, to be sure, is nearly as lovely as Efron. Our heroine works in her family’s kennel, which seems to be run out of a Victorian mansion; our hero rents an old shotgun shack and, with a bit of elbow grease, turns it into a furniture catalog, complete with a canopied bed (doesn’t every Marine want one?) and an adorable outdoor shower.

A better choice is the lamb musamun curry ($11.95), with tender meat, boiled peanuts and a light coconut milk sauce. It made up for disappointing grilled pork ribs ($10.95), which had none of the promised cilantro, garlic and chile sauce flavors. Still, they made enjoyable gnawing.

Officers were not met with any resistance when they arrived to search the home, Crump said, although a window was broken out by a tactical team.
It's important for me to compose honest, sincere music that connects with the music that is produced spontaneously by our culture. I hate the term "pop" music because for many it has pejorative undertones - implying that it is intrinsically superficial, lacking in depth or subtlety. The reality is that the body of music with wide appeal (i.e. "pop") is diverse - from forgettable ditties to sublime masterpieces. I feel that when a tune reaches iconic status - when it enters our lexicon of discourse - then it is giving voice to something that resonates strongly with us, something that speaks to and for us, reveals who we are without pretense.
"I know it's not going to get us there, but I'm just looking for any ways to find savings," he said.
Last month, a judge granted a request by the defense attorneys to release medical, mental health, criminal history and Child Protective Services records they believe will prove the allegations were "fabricated by a troubled 15-year-old with psychological problems."

SURPRISE, Ariz. Eric Hosmer has a life-altering swing you can find at the intersection of control and violence. He is in commercials already, 22 years old with a big truck, enough money to buy beachfront property with cash if he wanted, and the kind of mojo where he can get away with wearing a terrible faux hawk.

The victor will be provided for for life but must act as a mentor each year for the next set of tributes from his or her district. The mentor is somewhat of a pitchman for the tributes, playing up their chances in hopes that sponsors will offer food, medicine, weapons or other items that are air-dropped into the arena to boost the tributes' chances.
Laun is appreciative of Hillen as a professional partner, and the two are essentially STC's day-to-day leadership.
Called the Grey Folk, the Lashnura are healers who perform a ritual called dhota, by which they take on the sickness, injuries and even guilt of others. The ritual binds the two people together in a deep and lasting way. In times of crisis, a leader arises who is cleansed through dhota by the Heir of Gilgen and becomes Ison of the Isles. But Goth, the Heir of Gilgen, is being held prisoner by Corbin Talley, so no Ison can be created.
One could argue that the defense of traditional marriage was trotted out as a distraction from two unfunded wars and that once it served its purpose it was no longer needed. But I think it was more than that. I think America changed in that decade, and I will prove it with two words:

At Paragon, the oldest restaurant in the Pearl, general manager Bryan Westacott favors walk-in applicants. The comfort-food brasserie gets four to six job seekers a day dropping off résumés lately, Westacott said, up from one or two a day last year. And 70 percent have college degrees.
Throughout the four-hour meal, the service, guided by Todd Stillman, is impeccable. Waiters are knowledgeable and poised, and have mastered the art of making their presence known without being intrusive. It was interesting to watch them engage tables that clearly wanted to chat, but to step back when couples were romantically celebrating an important occasion.
Legislators have only 12 days left before they must adjourn the session, and many were voicing concerns on Tuesday that stadium negotiations have become so complex they might miss the deadline.
"I can understand the very real emotional distress sexual assault causes. But the criticism of IU — and I suspect most other universities — is misguided," Indiana spokesman Larry MacIntyre said. "We cannot just assume that every male accused of sexual assault is automatically guilty. We must investigate every case in a way that ensures both parties get a fair and just outcome. And the fact is, our dean of students staff and our IU Police Department are very good at doing just that."

If FitzGerald did choose to a veto, the 11-member council could override it with eight votes, a plausible development with eight Democrats who generally vote in lockstep.
Like Chrysler, GM had little inventory on lots going into the clunkers program. Many of its plants were closed for more than two months over the summer as it tried to cut inventories of unsold vehicles and restructure itself in a government-sponsored bankruptcy process.
Interesting that both men were traded when young and after going to Pro Bowls. Cutler has never been seen as warm and fuzzy. And a problem for Marshall could be the idealization of someone who he soon may realize has his own issues.

Moussa, who was Mubarak's foreign minister for years, and Shafiq, the former premier, are labeled pejoratively as "felool," an Arabic word that means "remnants."
But by giving the governor the majority of appointments on the nominating commission, the resolution sets up the prospect that a one-term governor could affect the state's highest courts for many years. The measure specifies that a governor gets to appoint two commission members upon taking office and two additional members in midterm. Staggering the appointments at four-year or even six-year intervals would be a better idea.

Enter Anne De Wolf, who owns Arciform, a firm that specializes in design, restoration and remodeling, with her husband, Richard. It would be possible to build the addition and make the necessary structural changes to the kitchen, Anne convinced Kerri, but the kitchen remodel could wait. A major change -- removing a kitchen wall and the stairway behind it -- would create more room for the future remodeled kitchen but would leave the area in disarray until the full project was completed.
"Don't forget Caylee," outraged Facebookers posted repeatedly for weeks, but when I asked someone recently what happened to Casey Anthony, they asked, "Who?"
The council agreed Monday to spend $5.8 million this year on repairs to Cleveland Browns Stadium that the team says are badly needed. The Browns' 30-year lease requires only that the city make annual payments of about $850,000 for maintenance.
In return, USC would assume about $1 million in annual rent payments that the Coliseum makes to the state, which owns the land. It would maintain the property and complete a host of renovations that would be funded in part with stadium revenues. School officials say the improvements would cost about $70 million.
Missouri's title loan law aimed to combat this cycle, or at least limit how long it can drag on. It restricts lender ability to renew the high-interest loans by requiring that the principal of the third renewal - and any subsequent one - must decrease by an amount equal to 10 percent of the first loan's principal.

“As the presidential race start to jell, President Obama may have benefited from Christie’s decision to stay out,” said Redlawsk, a professor of political science at Rutgers University. “Had the governor jumped in, New Jersey voters would have had a tougher decision: support the home state guy, or a Democratic president. What we’re seeing now is at least some movement back to New Jersey’s blue-state history. Even so, the election is far off and the Republican race is still not settled. Obama can take nothing for granted.”

Deirdre Cox was Carver’s PTSA president at the time. Still, she had heard nothing about the school’s reclassifying Chantel or other students into grade 10 1/2. She immediately suspected ulterior motives by officials concerned with meeting “adequate yearly progress” and other education benchmarks.
Nancy Fedder, a 62-year-old Hillsborough resident who has testified in favor of medical marijuana, said she and other patients are encouraged the drug is on the verge of becoming legal.

Not that the new plan will be cost-free. Lowering the interstate for more than a mile and covering it for 800 feet south of Swansea Elementary School could add $150 million to an already staggering cost of $1 billion. We don't dismiss the extra expense — and neither does Hunt, since it's not altogether clear where the state will find the funding. But tolling one additional lane in each direction would certainly help. And besides, as Hunt says, "what these neighborhoods have been through will hopefully help balance the ledger."

An 18-ounce cowboy steak, served Oscar style, is likewise an effective combination of a flamboyant dish prepared with precise care.

Affordable art: "Everyone can afford original art and be a part of San Francisco's thriving arts community. ArtSpan's Open Studios takes place every October; over 800 artists around the city invite the public into their creative spaces. (Some neighborhoods also do a Spring Open Studios.) With so many artists involved, it's easy to find work you feel a connection with. If your budget is limited, go for a smaller drawing or painting at first. But if you fall in love with a painting or sculpture that's outside your budget, many artists will let you make payments so you can get the piece that's meant to be yours." ( www.artspan.org)

Schafers, however, cautioned that students who work outside the American university's study abroad office can run the risk of acquiring credits that will not transfer back to the student's school of choice. "On the internet there are program finders that students can use to find study abroad programs that meet their basic requirements, but not all of them are good. One of the main things I do, in assisting students, is determining if the credits they take abroad will be acceptable to Fontbonne." When students participate in the study abroad options sponsored by their American university that concern all but disappears.

-Controlling the Waters: (1) A February bill in the Wyoming legislature to prepare the state for possible secession authorized a task force to consider establishing a state army, navy, marine corps and air force, and one amendment added the consideration of purchasing an aircraft carrier. Wyoming is, of course, landlocked, but it does have the 136-square-mile Yellowstone Lake, though that body of water is high up in the Teton mountains. (The aircraft-carrier amendment was defeated even though 27 representatives voted for it.) (2) Texas announced in February that it would deploy six gunboats to patrol the Mexican border's Rio Grande river. Said a state Department of Safety official, "It sends a message: Don't mess with Texas."
