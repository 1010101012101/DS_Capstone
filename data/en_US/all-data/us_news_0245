This commitment to comity could fall apart if lawmakers insist on showing up really early to stake out better or more visible seats. Kucinich often gets a seat that allows him to say a few words to the president as he enters or exits the chamber. But under the LaTourette agreement, Kucinich still will get an aisle seat, with LaTourette right next to him.
Nearby, places like John's Ocean Beach Cafe and Bashful Bull Too carry the torch for the city's throwback diners. In particular, the former has been perched away on Sloat Boulevard for more than 30 years, serving short-order breakfast and lunch in its old-school red booths or at one of its vintage stools along the counter. Neither diner's food will win any Michelin stars, but no one seems to mind.

Lynette Johnson had 13 points and 10 rebounds for Kennedy, but the stellar junior had no field goals in the second half as she was swarmed and surrounded by foes determined to slow her. Even with the game in hand, Price was in motion  coaching, barking, pleading for maximum effort.

But as an aficionado of puzzles, he wasn't about to make this proposal easy.

Culminating in a Menlo Park hotel room, the final clue was discovered in a Sudoku, which though it was meant to be grueling, Kathy whipped through. A number sequence opened the hotel room's safe, but as she was turning the dial, Doug proposed.

The Wings came right out at the pace they left off with in Game 3. Henrik Zetterberg had a chance his first shift when he angled the puck in from the left side, and Justin Abdelkader found the puck at his feet by the net after a Todd Bertuzzi's pass. Ian White came through with a nice hit on Patric Hornqvist. Danny Cleary was all alone by himself just outside the crease when he got the puck on his stick, but he shot too low to get by Rinne. The one time Rinne was out of position and the puck might have crossed the line, when Jonathan Ericsson rifled a shot in from the blue line, Mike Fisher scooped the puck out from along the goal line. Niklas Kronwall had a juicy chance slip through his hands when the puck skidded wide to the right.

I admit there are moments when I wouldn't mind living with someone whose talents run counter to mine. A person with enough muscle to pull up entrenched weeds would be welcome as well as one who knows the difference between a ball cock and a flapper tank ball on a toilet. A deeper voice and taller physique would present a more credible appearance to auto mechanics. It would be pleasant to live with someone who would drive me to Powell Hall after dark.

William Somerset in "Se7en" (1995): David Fincher's dark, dark mystery comes to a horrifying conclusion, but that doesn't mean Somerset, played by Morgan Freeman, in his wise older cop mode, isn't great fun to watch.

Though he was in attendance at practice today, Umenyiora was apparently miffed when the team told his agent, Tony Agnone, he was no longer free to seek a trade partner after failing to find a suitor who was willing to give up a first-round pick.

COLUMBUS, Ohio - Oversigning and grayshirting have become a hotter topic this recruiting season, with more people becoming aware of what has become a common practice at some schools: getting oral commitments from more players than a school has room for, then asking those players to delay their enrollment for a semester.

She searched the Internet for cabinet designs and hardware that would keep with the period. She found simple, paneled white cabinets. With brushed chrome handles, rippled glass cabinet inserts and modern dishwasher and refrigerator tucked out of sight, the kitchen honors its 1940s roots.
"You look at their run-pass combinations and they're pretty equal: the rushing yardage, the passing yardage, the total offense. I think that in itself is impressive," SIUC coach Dale Lennon assessed Missouri State. "I think they're averaging close to 300 yards per game in a pretty rough (schedule) with Arkansas and Oregon being the challenges there. The thing I'm really impressed with is they don't turn the ball over."
Sophomore Malik, 15, is already 6-7  make that 6-9 if you include his throwback hairstyle  think Kid from Kid 'n Play  and the most polished of the three. Blessed with supersized mitts and outsized athletic ability, he can play any position on the floor.

"Those arrested come from different origins and were supported by hidden internal forces," a statement read by soldiers Tuesday said.

Hill said Echols has been answering calls from God since she was a little girl.
"Some educators started coming online," he says. "Restaurateurs are making an incredible effort to get people to try something they're not used to. Sake started getting more face time."
Hitting, which held Oregon back last year, will likely tell the tale. UO is off to an improved start in that department, batting .281 with nine home runs and 96 runs scored. However, those numbers are somewhat pedestrian in the Pac-12 where the Ducks’ batting average ranks 11th and the runs scored ranks tied for eighth. UO’s home runs rank tied for fourth. Still, the team is feeling collective confidence at the plate.
Left-handed starter Elvis Araujo (0-2, 4.00) allowed four runs (three earned) in five innings.
Jeremy Affeldt entered and did his job while striking out Ryan Howard. But the Phillies engineered a double steal during the at-bat, and Bochy had Affeldt intentionally walk Jayson Werth to load the bases.
The move would be significant for SLU. Butler would be the closest team to St. Louis, helping reduce the sometimes-arduous travel SLU faces in an East Coast-centered league, and give the team a natural rival. Butler and SLU, along with A-10 teams Dayton, Xavier and Duquesne, played together in the Midwestern Collegiate Conference from 1982-83 to 1990-91.
Sen. Rollie Heath revealed one of his jobs in the Army was to sign off on the "108" discharge forms dismissing military members who were gay.

In his later years at the Oregon-based shoe company, Edwards felt a tug to help others enter the industry, especially woman and people of color -- two groups he said that are underrepresented in the industry's design shops. About a third of the students attending the UO course are receiving some sort of financial assistance; Edwards' is sponsoring one student himself.
More than half of workers returning from career breaks sign on with companies smaller than those they left, the Wharton study shows. Smaller employers tend to be less hung up on conventional career ladders; checking out such firms “is even more important in this down market,” Ms. Cohen says.
The bill, which Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber wants as part of his package of health care reforms, now becomes a chip in the end-of-session horse-trading over bills Republicans want.
But the long memories of Cleveland sports fans showed some hints of amnesia the day after James announced he could envision himself again playing for the Cavaliers someday, maybe even when he has an opt-out clause in his contract in 2014.
No doubt his declaration prompted lawmakers to pound their mental rewind buttons.
A little different. It was fun though. Being in this ballpark after being up here for a while last year, I had some familiarity, said Furbush, who came to Seattle in the deal that sent Doug Fister to Detroit last summer. I know the guys and know some of their tendencies as hitters. Kind of felt a little at home.

The new parliament will begin its sessions in late May. It has no direct control over key foreign and security policy matters like Iran's nuclear program, but it can influence those issues and economic policies as well as the run-up to the election of Ahmadinejad's successor. Ahmadinejad is constitutionally barred from seeking a third consecutive four-year term and must step down in 2013.
Medical-marijuana policy in long-term-care facilities across Colorado is hazy at best.
Orders fell in April and June, partly because of supply disruptions stemming from the March 11 earthquake in Japan. And a spike in gas prices earlier this year cut into consumer spending, reducing demand for big-ticket items, such as computers, appliances and furniture.

Under that model, if the Redskins were to offer that second-rounder in this year's draft, plus their first-rounders this year and next, the Rams just might call it a deal. Media reports about the Rams reaping three or four first-rounders for Griffin are very optimistic. Griffin might be charming and talented ... .but not that charming and talented.
"Cleveland is still on the rise in 1912," said Greg Deegan, a Beachwood High School social studies teacher who helped found the Teaching Cleveland Institute, a year-long course for middle and high school teachers on Cleveland history, economics, and public policy. "It's this big, brawling, smelly, alive town, where commerce is king and people are living in ethnic enclaves near their work. And the population just keeps skyrocketing.
Despite the connection between Ivins and the sorority, authorities acknowledge they cannot place the scientist in Princeton the day the anthrax was mailed. That remains a hole in the government's case.

In a report to UB President Robert L. Bogomolny in February, the faculty senate said it felt too much money was being spent on institutional costs and not enough on faculty salaries and teaching. The report, which was an analysis of expenditures, said that enrollment by degree-seeking students was more than double the increase in teaching faculty from 2004 to 2010. While enrollment rose by more than 30 percent, the teaching faculty rose by less than 10 percent.
Most creeps, however, don't ask for permission. Perhaps my mistake was asking.
Luis takes a hard look at the engine. Then he scoots under the Jeep to get a better look. The water pump is busted, he thinks. So the men start twisting off caps from bottles of drinking water and pouring them into the radiator. A moment passes. Then the water just leaks out.
Some dishes lapse into the ordinary, such as lemon grass chicken, which reposed under a thick blanket of semi-sodden peanut sauce. Another concern might be that service and focus seem to waver on crowded Saturday nights; you might want to get your fried stuffed calamari, and a little more attention, during the week.
Probably not as much as Rams fans hope or the team needs. First, it's a one-year deal. If the Rams were looking for a big impact and had a lot of faith in Smith's health, they would have signed him for more than one year. Second, my colleague, Jim Thomas, classified him as a possession receiver. Danny Amendola is a possession receiver. Greg Salas was used as a possession receiver. How many of these guys do the Rams need?
Green said it is hard tell what impact the ads played in the minds of voters but said it could explain why the poll numbers shifted.
The terrorist was so successful that 10 years later we are still living in mortal fear. We have become slaves to our mania for security, and for it we have sacrificed not only modesty, but privacy, peace of mind and, to a large extent, personal autonomy.

Now, there's an argument to be made that we do not have a duty to protect. That foreign policy is not social work. That you risk American lives only when national security and/or strategic interests are at stake, not merely to satisfy the humanitarian impulses of some of our leaders.
Asked whether he was an advocate for the Vikings stadium, Zellers replied with one word: "No."
This time, alas, the ghouls were pretty much right. The best to be said of the weirdly inert spectacle is that the vistas are attractive, in a muted way (yes, Mars is red and Mars is dry, but prettier colors wouldn't have constituted a crime against astronomy); the flying machines strike a nice balance between giant dragonflies and the paintings of Bruce McCall; and the battles are impressive, in a routine way, though it makes no sense that the hero's gift for jumping should give him the power to fight his way through vast throngs of bloodthirsty adversaries.
"Gus was unbelievable from start to finish," said Mr. Postseason himself, Danny Briere, who scored his fifth goal of the series.
To her family and friends, she was just "Nippy." A nickname given to Houston when she was a child, it stuck with her through adulthood and, later, would become the name of one of her companies. To them, she was a sister, a friend, a daughter, and a mother.

"Defense and rebounding, that's the whole key," Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said. "The big thing was they got into the open floor. They got easy baskets. You get easy baskets early in the game, you're going to get confidence. When a team gets confidence, they're much harder to shut down."
On Monday, Ross told U.S. District Judge Rodney Sippel that although he knew when he became a police officer that he could get killed, he said he was not prepared for the emotional, physical and financial roller coaster of being shot.

Prompted by an undercover film from the Humane Society of the United States that shows workers kicking and shocking downer cows -- cattle too sick to walk to their own slaughter -- the Chino, Calif.-based Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Co. recalled 143 million pounds of raw and frozen beef. (Stunningly, the government still lacks the legal authority to require food recalls -- it can only recommend them).
I have a loyal band of emailers who love to rag me about Latinos. (It's so sweet, some write almost daily, although their bosses probably wish they were working instead of corresponding with a journalist.) The one complaint I hear over and over is how "everything" is in Spanish, something they attribute to Latinos not learning English. And then they tell me that when their grandparents came here, they learned English.
Nix's experiences already have made him one of the stronger voices in the locker room. People are more inclined to listen when they respect the path you've taken. Nix encourages those teammates who, like himself, think that they've become Izzo's own personal piñata to hear what's underneath the screaming.
Sound of Ideas: Last week, we talked about the surge in development fueled by colleges in Northeast Ohio. Cleveland State, Kent State, Case Western Reserve, Akron and Oberlin all are seeing big, off-campus development in partnership with on-campus departments.

Entering Friday, Putz was 0-2 with a 13.50 ERA in his prior seven games; for the season he had a 9.00 ERA, opponents were hitting .333 against him, and he'd given up four homers in 10 innings. Putz's previous outing was his worst. He allowed five hits and four earned runs in two-thirds of an inning Wednesday against St. Louis.
Schwarzenegger swaggered into town like a real-life action hero, vowing to "blow up the boxes" of government. But the movie-star governor was not larger than life, and like many before him he became mired in partisan battles.

"The recall seems to be the newest instant gratification pill by some of the negative naysayers in the country," says Plusquellic, a Democrat. "It makes it very difficult and it's one of the reasons why a lot of people refuse to run for public office."
Unlike men, women often don't experience chest pain at all. Instead, they might experience a little shortness of breath, jaw discomfort, nausea — or just a "funny feeling" that something is not right, he says.

With their new movie, "Burn After Reading," directors Joel and Ethan Coen once again let us know that they make movies. Not franchises. Not brands.

Why would mental control over our daydreams make us more healthy? It turns out that having a well-functioning default mode network--one that lets us explore ourselves and our lives but doesn't intrude into our efforts to concentrate when that's what's needed--is critical to mental health.
Easter moves Christians to reflect on the life of Jesus. In his name we uphold the value of justice and renew our commitment to the dignity of all human life. This November, for the first time in 31 years, we will have the option to say no to capital punishment.

Suburban development and television's impact on viewing habits may have crippled the arts scene before, but author and historian Helen-Chantal Pike says what has boosted it in the past decade is the government.

Their professional distance — and her professional hauteur — suddenly disappears when her soldier fiancé is presumed dead in Afghanistan.
"We're not really concerned about that, because we have loyal shoppers here at PV Mall with great crowds to take advantage of the Black Friday deals," she said.
Just think of the resistance to the Indy Connect plan to expand mass transit. Or to The Mind Trust with its out-of-the-box ideas on how to reform schools. Or to the smoking ban that took way too long to pass or to, of all things, bike lanes. Or to the organizers of Focus 2020, who recognize that the population of Central Indiana is growing more diverse but that many Hoosiers aren't ready or don't want to deal with new cultures or new people.
Playfully sticking out his tongue when a photographer tried to coax him into smiling; helping a young neighbor with her arithmetic in return for gumdrops; posing in a pair of slippers as fluffy as his halo of white hair — these were some of his very human quirks.

DESERT PINES
Gay marriage is a hot-button issue, but "The Kids Are All Right" doesn't push buttons or advance an agenda. The film plays fair with love in its myriad forms, and insists on the need for close and stable connections, whatever the home's configuration may be; in that sense it's almost conservative. The cast includes Yaya DaCosta as Tanya, a stunning, straight free-swinger who'd be delighted to start a family; Zosia Mamet as Joni's sex-obsessed friend; and Joaquín Garrido as a sad-eyed, ill-used Latino gardener. Igor Jadue-Lillo did the fine, unfussy cinematography.
I did, and the funny thing is I was the nerdy girl in high school. So I go back to my reunion a few years ago, and the strange thing was everyone was back in their cliques from when we were teenagers. I gravitated right back to the nerds and dorks, who were still wonderful people. And then there was this one cheerleader who was so snotty to me at the reunion in exactly the same way she was snotty in high school! She had been through a few marriages by now and was chain-smoking and drinking at the reunion. Still, she came up to tell me, "People say you're on television, but I've never seen you." Then she walked away. All the nerds and dorks looked at each other said in unison, "B----!" Then we fell out laughing.

It's a formula most teams exhibit against the Lakers because of their age and athleticism. But San Antonio made the Lakers gasp for breath simply by outworking them. They controlled the boards, 42-29. The Spurs reeled off 22 fastbreak points. And as illustrated in the play above, they appeared to fight more for every loose ball.

A family in our community lost their teenage son when he fell from the fifth-floor balcony of his apartment at college. He was smart, kind and gregarious — a boy with a twin brother, a kid brother and loving parents. One night he leaned too far over his balcony in the darkness and plummeted to his death.
One of the biggest concerns appears to be the rather unwieldy pit road area, where some drivers will enter from the left, meaning they will exit into the fast lane, while others will enter from the right, and reenter in the slow lane. All the drivers will have to negotiate a sharper-than-normal turn right at the end of the pit area.

Bottom line: Machiavelli could learn a thing or two about divide-and-conquer from Ohio House Speaker William Batchelder, a conservative Medina Republican. The map pretty much assures that a black Democrat (Fudge or someone else) will hold Fudge's district, and that a black Democrat could win that congressional seat representing Columbus. So, of the 12 black Democrats in the Ohio House, three voted "yes" (approved the Batchelder map bill), five black Democrats noted "no" -- and four black Democrats didn't vote.

American Bird Conservancy experts now favor control over goose populations — beyond the estimated 2.6 million killed by hunters each year. They recommend hazing with noise-making devices, trained dogs and remote-controlled drones that fly over geese and mimic the cries of predatory eagles.
Why it could change: The defense must replace some significant pieces, including popular—and highly successful—coordinator Jeff Casteel.

During its evolution, Capital One Tampa temporarily became a hub for handling its auto finance calls. Now it's back to handling credit card issues, including late payments and fraud disputes.
The Wildecats take a precipitous fall after losing by 20 to the Gladiators. I don’t think many people, even on the Glenelg sideline, could have predicted that outcome. Wilde Lake could get Antoine Barnes back in the near future, so this might be a hiccup. With River Hill and Atholton still on the schedule, though, the defending state champs can’t afford any more slip-ups.
Aney Chandy, immediate past president of the Asian Pacific American Lawyers Association of New Jersey, called Kwon "such an incredible choice" for his experience and for being the first Asian-American nominated.

Sonner and Uhrig are being criticized in some corners for stepping into the limelight in the case on Tuesday, only to announce that they are no longer involved with Zimmerman. Legal analysis on CNN Wednesday morning raised questions about whether the men were actually even truly representing Zimmerman -- they'd reportedly only communicated with him via email, texts and phone calls, and never actually sat down with him face to face.
People I respect tell me the governor came up with solid proposals exceeding their expectations. Quinn has offered detailed specifics - from raising the retirement age for state employees to eliminating dental care for the poor.

Even if Democrats aren’t able to overturn the governor’s veto, there’s reason to keep the issue front and center as Christie prepares for re-election next year.
That's what you find out in tonight's gut-wrenching season opener. With Banks upping his game as the intimidating fixer, it's everything good you could ask of "Breaking Bad" -- except, perhaps, a sinister chuckle or two and the chance to collect your overwrought senses.
Gilbert Fire Department's hazmat team went to check on the two 55-gallon drums found on the property and determined they do not represent an immediate threat.

Perhaps in his mind, Ford had already answered enough questions, and doled out enough advice. Ever since the Mississippi native moved to Portland in 1951, men and women, old and young, would regularly come to Ford for advice on their marital challenges. Police would seek his guidance on how to protect and serve a black community that historically didn’t like or trust cops. Community advocates would seek his wisdom about staying committed to the fight against gang violence. And politicians would hear an earful about any proposed social services cuts in the city of Portland’s budget.
Gwinnett County, the state's largest school district, put a priority on helping students reach the "exceeds standards" category and saw some payoff, particularly at the elementary school level. Fifty-five percent of Gwinnett fourth-graders were top scorers on the CRCT science test.
According to a resulting presentation slide, dated July 2008—the one headlined "Get in the Game"—Google offered fewer ways to measure an ad's effectiveness than Atlas, a rival owned by Microsoft.

"The spending patterns this Christmas looks better, but unemployment continues to be a big question," said Kim Caughey Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.
Everything on this list is animal abuse dressed up as dog training. Dogs don't learn this way — well, they don't learn what you want them to learn. Instead, they learn to fear you, to be suspicious of you, to guard against you, to brace themselves when they see you coming or even go on the offensive. No reputable trainer would employ or advocate the use of any of these tactics with the goal of educating a dog.

The U.S. government said Thursday it will work with large pharmaceutical companies to try to find new uses for once-promising drugs that have been cast aside by the industry.
The motoring public's view of this is not entirely rational. Witness the blame heaped on President Barack Obama for oil prices that are beyond a nation's (let alone a president's) control.

Brendan Dunleavy, the county's former auditor general, called the ordinance a farce. Commissioner Joe Palamara, D-Grosse Ile, can still work as a Lansing lobbyist, and the new law won't stop County Executive Robert Ficano from bankrolling -- through his political action committee -- the campaigns of commissioners, who are supposed to provide a check on his authority.

You've heard it before: Ever since Allen began extricating himself from his films, he's hired a parade of younger actors to play "the Woody Allen role." This is not true for every film Allen has made since vanishing from the screen, but when it happens, you know it. "Midnight in Paris" is such a film. Alas, Wilson's line-reads leave the viewer feeling nostalgic for the old Woody. As Gil, a screenwriter of Hollywood drivel who longs to write a serious novel, Wilson just isn't Jewish or neurotic enough.
Coleen Goodwin "did hesitate to transport, and that was really upsetting to me," said Kennedy, who trained at The Baby Place between 2007 and 2010. She left to open a practice in Hawaii, in part over these concerns.

One of Mr. Romney's most obvious shortcomings is his inability to tell stories about himself that provide a window into who he really is.

The fourth (and crowning) irony: There's a lot of evidence Ohio's perceived "high tax problem" is caused as much or more by the plague of local taxes (charged by counties, school boards, cities, villages, townships and a swarm of "special districts" and "authorities") than by state taxes payable to Columbus.

There is not much difference in lifestyle between an income of $4.6 million and one of $5 million.

Indiana is one of only three states -- Mississippi and New Mexico are the other two -- that don't require police to report incidents of sexual violence to the FBI.

The agile frontman refused to let his hoarseness affect the rest of his performance. He charged around the stage, eyes popping, leaping in and out of the spotlight, gesturing to his bandmates with theatrical waves of his hands. His flute-playing was, as always, exuberant: he snorted, grunted, overblew, flutter-tongued, forced guttural noises out of his axe, executed runs at blinding speed, and alternated between wet, breathy, and mockingbird-sweet tones. He stalked the curved front of the PNC stage, piping as he went; from time to time, he sustained that famous stork-legged pose that is to Anderson what the moonwalk was to Michael Jackson.

A painter who revels in lush atmospherics and sensual color, de Luca recounts being particularly energized by the pop-inflected abstractions of painter Joe Goode. "It gives me the freedom to choose another history. The authority figure on the shoulder has definitely been slightly toppled."

Valerie Benoit-Charbonneau, the sole female and self-proclaimed "flirtatious" member of the group, attempts to read a book while physically battling an uncooperative recliner.

That has all changed, thanks to decades of relentless advocacy and public service advertising. New, tougher laws no doubt helped, but even they needed reinforcement from long-term, concerted efforts to redefine acceptable behavior.

"People just need to buy the best they can afford, or approach buying quality equipment for their kitchen with the thought that these are lifetime purchases -- kind of like how our parents used to buy couches -- you sat on the same one from infancy until you moved out of the house.

But that doesn't mean hospital administrators aren't gearing up for program and revenue shifts, even as the debate over the federal health care overhaul continues.
Garber came to Chicago in 2002 and soon rose to the top of the industry. He gave generally modest amounts of money to various state and local political campaigns, including to former Mayor Richard M. Daley's, as well as Rahm Emanuel's 2011 opponent, Gery Chico, while his companies grew to control about a tenth of the city's taxi fleet through maroon cabs under the names Chicago Carriage or Royal 3CCC.

The desolate, scrubby plain around Ridgecrest, where the Sierra Nevada meets the Great Basin and the Mojave desert, might seem an incongruous source for tomatoes, especially in the middle of winter. Nevertheless, Scott and Gale Shacklett, who go by the name of TomatoMan, manage to produce superior, flavorful tomatoes in more than half an acre of greenhouses here, where sonic booms from the China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station shatter the silence.
The bleak settings of dystopian books strike a chord in teens because their own emotions are so raw, Craft said. "The stories speak to a better part of ourselves, suggesting that with courage and bravery, you can be who you want to be."

The fine, which PG&E had appealed to the Public Utilities Commission, represents the first time that the commission's Consumer Protection and Safety Division levied penalties against the utility under new authorities awarded last December. The division was given more teeth in response to federal criticism of the commission's safety policies in the wake of the deadly San Bruno pipeline blast. Previously, the safety division had to seek approval from the full commission to impose penalties.
Last November, Quinn hired Gary Hannig to run his legislative operation. Hannig is an old Springfield hand. He was one of the most trusted members of House Speaker Michael Madigan's leadership team before becoming the state's secretary of transportation.

Laura is emblematic of the entire ordeal. Hirsch captured her shortly after her son's death. She and Kirk are in their bedroom, with him sitting on the bed struggling to put words to their loss. Laura can't even sit. She is slumped on the floor next to the bed, her sleepless face flush with the painful puffiness of shock, horror, confusion and cried-out eyes.
Red Rock Canyon State Park — where the southernmost tip of the Sierra Nevada meets the El Paso Range and just two hours north of downtown L.A. — is one of those places. The 4,000-acre swath of spectacular desert scenery could easily be a double for the Southwest. Exploration on foot is the main attraction, and camping brings you flush up against the scenery.
Bahn mi (bon mee) are traditional Vietnamese sandwiches that reflect the nation's colonial French influence. I've had bahn mi before and was sorely disappointed by the dryness of the sandwich. There's nothing arid about the sandwiches at Saigon Kitchen, though. The generous baguette packed with moist barbecued pork as well as cilantro, carrots and cucumber, delivered a few small tingles of electricity, probably from the barbecue glaze ($6). It's big enough to share if you want to order several items.
Many of the college basketball bracket-predicting gurus had Seton Hall in the field, but after the brackets were revealed, NCAA Tournament selection committee chairman Jeff Hathaway said Seton Hall wasn’t as close to the last four teams in as originally believed.

In addition, Spencer said, he might conduct a couple of two-a-day practice sessions to bolster conditioning.
_ "Tim Burton's Corpse Bride" (2005): One of only a handful of animated films Burton's made over his three-decade career — although a feature-length version of "Frankenweenie" is due out this fall — this is one of the best examples of the emotions of Burton's films matching the visuals. Combining painstaking stop-motion animation with digital technology, he's come up with a film that's wondrous, strange and poignant. Yes, it does look a lot like "Edward Scissorhands" and "Beetlejuice," and it features an all-star voice cast led by Burton regulars Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, but this medium brings these familiar details beautifully to life. Even creatures that are disgusting in reality are cute and sort of charming here.
Brees completed a 66-yard touchdown pass to Jimmy Graham with 1:37 left and the Saints seemed poised to rally from an early 17-point deficit when Smith and Davis delivered once more. It was a wild back-and-forth finish featuring an impressive passing duel over the waning moments.

If you prefer to have printed multiple versions while reading, there are two English Bibles which make this handy. The Amplified Bible says that it tries to give the English reader the depth that a native speaker would have if they could read scripture in their own tongue. For Genesis 1:1 it says; "In the beginning God (prepared, formed, fashioned, and) created the heavens and the earth." Does that really say the same thing as the King James?

We gave him a little grief for that."
The line from Mr. Stuart's career to the origins of country isn't hard to follow. At 13, he joined Lester Flatt's group. In the 1940s, Flatt was a member of Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys, the seminal band in country-music history. Two Blue Grass members, Flatt and Earl Scruggs, later found an audience in the '60s and '70s in a Woodstock Generation searching for authentic American roots music. "When rock 'n' roll hit, Flatt and Scruggs never wavered," he said. "Their sonic empire was founded on something beyond the commercial."

Make no attempt to categorize Josh Rzepka. He's a trumpet player, all right. But once you establish this obvious fact, it isn't wise to pigeonhole the 25-year-old musician. What's clear about the gifted Akron native is that he's determined to craft a career that blurs boundaries between classical and jazz. He's already made an audacious start. This summer (on his own dimes), he is recording compact discs in both genres, performing with jazz colleagues on one and as soloist in Baroque concertos on another.

For one basketball season, she tried. Summitt tried to be what she once was, but she couldn't do it. The early onset dementia that she so bravely announced to the sports world just last August already had robbed her of so many of the brilliant and fiery qualities that made her one of the most remarkable coaches in any American sport, ever. The intricate plays that used to dance in her mind? Someone else was drawing those up now. The televised locker-room pep talks that turned into unforgettable tirades thankfully preserved forevermore on sports television and YouTube? Someone else's as well.
