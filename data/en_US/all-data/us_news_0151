Like gray hair, wrinkles and the ability to remember your second-grade teacher's name but forget how you banged your shin this week, it's normal to bruise more frequently as you age. Your skin becomes thinner, and your capillaries (itsy-bitsy blood vessels) become more fragile, so a tiny bump can cause a bruise. And, yes, aspirin's blood-thinning effects intensify this. But thinner blood that doesn't clump up and clot easily is what you need and what your doc is after.

Then, he committed a dumb personal-foul penalty to give the Giants 15 yards on their way to a touchdown late in the second quarter. A few plays later he gave Nicks a huge cushion to the inside for no apparent reason on a 30-yard catch. (This time I waited to hear what Aikman had to say and he made a good point about Manning putting the ball where it needed to be.) Allen allowed Nicks to run right by him on the deep ball on which Manning overshot his target. And finally, he got juked out of his cleats by Bradshaw in the fourth quarter.

Isn't this a basic courtesy that will speed up our commutes?

I'm going with the Texans, who already are a playoff team. Gary Kubiak is noted as a strong QB coach (because he played the position behind Elway and because he coached Elway and Young with Shanahan and has coached Matt Schaub who was on the way to the Pro Bowl in 2011 before getting injured). The Texans have a world-class running back and a world-class wide receiver, an excellent defense if they re-sign Mario Williams and a good offensive line. They have an indoor-outdoor stadium, an owner with money, and they play in the same division as the Colts, so Manning is familiar with the Texans, and would play twice against the team that let him go, and wouldn't have to be in the NFC playing against his brother or, as he would with the Dolphins or the Jets, playing the Patriots and Tom Brady twice a year.

The other deductions we have in place are for health care, for housing, and for pensions. All things to help support and stabilize families. And of course charities, churches -- key to those mediating institutions. What do I mean by mediating institutions? Institutions that stand between you and the government. If there isn't anything between you and the government, if there's a naked public square, if you are there alone with nobody around you and you're out there paddling alone, then government becomes your lifeboat. And when government becomes your lifeboat, freedom is ultimately lost because you've now sold out. No fault of your own, in many cases, but that's what's left.

Woods said the witnesses in the car -- who police have not identified -- said two unknown men came up to the car and started a flirty conversation with the group several hours before the killing. Woods said the men did not realize the group was transsexuals, and when they were told, they left. But later they returned.

Here’s another instance of The X Factor being different from American Idol. While you will get to vote on who you like best on The X Factor, the judges ultimately get to decide who stays and who goes on the first few weeks of competition. The two acts with the fewest votes typically have a sing-off each week. Then the judges decide who goes home. If the judges have a deadlock, then it goes to the viewers’ votes to give someone the boot. I think this definitely helps in building viewer support for contestants from week to week.

"Between Two Ferns": If you haven't seen Zach Galifianakis as the world's most awkward, offensive and totally unprepared talk show host ever, you're in for a treat. The comic actor's Web talk-show parody makes its prime-time debut at 8:30 tonight, right before the Comedy Central Comedy Awards. Tina Fey and Jon Stewart will appear as the straight-faced guests, who always leave dazed, confused and often furious at the experience. In the past, Galifianakis has sneezed on Jon Hamm and prompted Ben Stiller to walk off early and punch the cheap cable-access-style set. Classic moment: When Galifianakis played an audio clip of Stiller's then-new movie "Greenberg" and the star asked why not use a video clip, the host replied, "Too much trouble." Can Galifianakis successfully adapt his often-raunchy online series for a cable special? Stay tuned.

Tax bills were going up by more than 7 percent annually in the mid-2000s before a 4 percent cap was enacted by Gov. Jon Corzine in 2007. The last two years saw average statewide increases of 3.7 and 3.3 percent.

At times, the buttons on the Wii remote don't register your actions fast enough, so it is very difficult to be successful at this activity.

The fashions sported by the cast are getting more experimental by the episode. All manner of '60s styles are grooving again today, including mod Italian furnishings and adorable cars: The Fiat 500, newly hip, became popular in the 1960s, as did mod minimalist furniture. "Mad Men" has helped to fuel a fascination with an era that, much like ours, welcomed creativity and social change. That era also gave birth to the pantsuit.

It took a Popeye video to bring the blogosphere around to this one, but the song itself is better. A squall of feedback sets the tone, joined by Jeff Tweedy making the most of his upper register on the opening line, "I've been young/ I've been old/ I've been hurt and consoled."

And any song that takes you from a squealing noise-rock solo to a whistling break is clearly doing something right.

Notes: Matthews had a miserable night, going 3 for 11 from the field and 2 for 4 from the line. Both of his free-throw misses came on attempts after a technical. "Just one of those nights. I felt I was hit on a couple, but there aren't any shots I would take back." ...
