"But I was talking with the guys (drivers) when they were driving passenger cars around the track this morning before getting into their race cars. They were very, very impressed with how smooth it was. That's when Brad tweeted he thought they were going to go 220 miles per hour. I don't think they are going to go 220, Brad, but youthful exuberance is most welcome."

The historic downtown building was built in 1917 and placed on the National Registry of Historic Places in 1985. Since the park district purchased it in 2008, it has spent $754,000 to replace windows, repair the roof and install gutters and add a sprinkler system. The renovation project was expected to completed in three phases: the second phase of the project was expected to cost $3.4 million and third phase was expected to cost $5-6 million, according to park district officials.

Tracy Martin, who maintains that his son was targeted because of his race, said he told the teen prejudices could lead to danger.
Why they’re here: Steve Spurrier has finally given in. He’ll no longer force a quarterback who can’t throw it consistently to toss it around 30 times a game. So he’s running the ball and playing defense and getting key throws off play-action. It led to 11 wins last year. It could lead to more in 2012.
The drink I'm featuring from Absinthe's new cocktail list this week wasn't created by Raglin, Hollinger or any of the talented crew at the brasserie, though. It was invented by a certain Wil P. Taylor, a man who had quite a reputation in Cuba in the 1930s.
The goal is to get travelers to commit now, rather than waiting until the last minute.
"In '94, I was trying to get elected and it was more of a political effort," he said. "I'm trying to get elected now, but getting elected isn't enough. ... The challenges we face here over the next year really need to be teed up during the campaign."
He says the officers were escorting a prison van, but no prisoner was hurt.
"Furnish" the master bath with a wood vanity and cabinets in a rich finish that would be nice enough to display in the bedroom or kitchen. Go with a granite or marble countertop. Select natural stone for the floor. Texture a backsplash with stone tiles or a textured finish like troweled-on clay. One showstopper is enough to make a room look special and new.
The Baltimore Grand Prix attracted about 160,000 spectators to watch cars roaring through streets around the Inner Harbor but left a trail of public and private debt, including about $1.5 million owed to the city in taxes and service fees. Critics have said Baltimore Racing Development was disorganized and lacked clear leadership — a point that Davidson addresses, saying in retrospect that the organizational structure "wasn't efficient."

Critics blame him for a steady coarsening of Italian society, especially its attitude toward women. Here was a leader who awarded government jobs to pretty starlets (some of them suspected of being his lovers), threw parties that allegedly featured strippers and hookers, and, through his vast media empire, bombarded Italy with images of women as playthings whose most important attributes for getting ahead were physical.
He'll deal with the changes then.

Charges of foreclosure-condition discrimination come on the heels of earlier complaints that lenders practiced "reverse redlining" -- targeting minority borrowers for expensive subprime loans with onerous terms that made foreclosure likely, and paying out bonuses to brokers when borrowers accepted loans with higher interest rates than they actually qualified for.

WASHINGTON - Congressional committees are widening their investigations into an alleged U.S. Secret Service scandal involving prostitutes in Colombia ahead of a recent trip there by President Barack Obama.
Thanks to Pacific Standard Time and in particular to the ongoing LACMA exhibition "Living in a Modern Way: California Design 1930-1965," L.A.'s Midcentury design pioneers are back in the spotlight. One of the best ways to dig deeper into this well known body of work is through the rich variety of short films made by the husband and wife team of Charles and Ray Eames. Collected in a six-DVD set, the series includes the classic "Powers of Ten" along with "Toccata for Toy Trains," "Day of the Dead" and my personal favorite, "Blacktop."
It would seem, having read most of what the paper of record has reported on this sad saga, that Mrs. Love is guilty of what she accuses of others. To wit, at some point in time, after one of her daughter's many brouhahas in Virginia, the two had a long tete-a-tete, then met overnight in Annapolis to discuss the upheavals in Yeardley's life. So, at what point did Mrs. Love have the responsibility to deal with her daughter's aberrant association with Mr. Huguely, for her to speak with the university's athletic director, etc.? Certainly, she was not without knowledge that things were bad or dangerous. Those will be very embarrassing questions for her to answer in discovery in this case.
Police say the slain woman and her daughter-in-law, who was also unharmed, were robbed at gunpoint last week a block away from their home in the crime-plagued city.
Boeing is also pitching its 787 as a major upgrade for travelers. It was designed with larger windows, more space in overhead bins and improved lighting. The jet was also designed to provide air pressure and humidity levels that more closely resemble those on the ground, a feature that Boeing says will ease jet lag.

While the officer left the hospital in a wheelchair and still feels somewhat weak and sore, he's been to Central Park with a physical therapist — once for a mile-and-a-half walk, another time for a jog, said Bederson, who is Mount Sinai's chairman of neurosurgery.
As an activist, McFarlane could delight in his inner prankster, as he did when recalling the early days of ACT UP, a protest group that he helped found.
Morris' work isn't overtly agenda-driven, but nonetheless, "Beaux" proposes imagery that controverts the common notions of gender, and not just in dance. Do we find the ballet effeminate because Morris presents male interactions stripped of bravado and confrontation? Because the men are clad in Mizrahi's unitards speckled with bright pinks and yellows? Because they seem kind to each other? And more importantly, what does that say about our preconceived notions of what a "guys' ballet" should look like?
The product-quality watchdog said the new iPad can get as hot as 116 degrees Fahrenheit while performing processor-intensive tasks such as playing videogames for an extended period while plugged in. That temperature is 12 degrees more than the iPad 2, Consumer Reports said.

Today, California has the nation's second-, third- and fifth-most heavily used Amtrak routes, creating a foundation for high-speed rail. No high-speed rail service in the world was built without a successful conventional rail precedent.
The Packers' victory sends Green Bay to the Georgia Dome to play the top-seeded Atlanta Falcons on Saturday night. If the Bears beat the Seahawks and the Packers defeat the Falcons, the NFC Championship Game would not only be played at Soldier Field but would feature the league's longest-running rivalry. The Bears and Packers have only met once in the postseason, and that was in 1941.
Perry drew laughter as well as applause when he said that federal bureaucrats would experience pain as a result of his plans to cut spending, especially those in the departments of education, commerce and energy. That was a reference to his gaffe in an earlier debate when he couldn't recall the name of the third of the Cabinet-level agencies he has proposed eliminating.
Oregon has applied for a waiver from the No Child Left Behind act, the federal law requiring schools to show proficiency in reading and math. Under the governor's plan, Oregon would shake free of the No Child rules and instead rely on customized "achievement compacts" between the state and

7. Maverick (1994): Mel Gibson managed to bring the charm and swagger that James Garner did in the late 1950s/early 1960s TV show with his turn as the rogue gambler/good guy in this entertaining western. Good fun from Gibson, Jodie Foster and Garner himself as a marshal.
While realistically this is still so -- unless American voters are prepared to dispense with Medicare, Social Security, the Federal Reserve Board and even our existence as a sovereign nation-state -- at least rhetorically conservatives have a narrative advantage. That is, their story of individual freedom and tyrannical government enjoys a privileged place in the lexicon because of its association with our political origins.
The event will also include rock climbing, zip lines, scuba, archery, robots, arts and crafts, games, technology exhibits, a Girl Scout heritage museum, service projects, jousting, obstacle courses, animal talks by the staff of "Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom", live entertainment all day, fly fishing and outdoor skills demonstrations.

Between that stroke an the first inning, Bochy and Lincecum tried to put a positive spin on the rest of Lincecum's night. He struck out six and walked only one.
Holley testified that he and three friends stole a piano keyboard and some vodka from a townhome in southwest Houston in March 2010. Later that day, police stopped the youths' truck and Holley ran. He said a police car knocked him over and as he lay on the ground he put his hands on his head to indicate surrender.
With the playoffs starting later this month, this intensive focus on Rose is understandable. He almost single-handedly carried the Bulls to last year's Eastern Conference finals, where the Miami Heat dismissed them in five games.
Investors use yields on long-term debt to hint at the next flash point in the European debt crisis. For much of the past year, that meant Greece. However, market participants worried that losses arising from a Greek default would encourage banks and other institutional investors to offload holdings in the debt of other troubled members of the euro zone. Italy, in political disarray and with its own uncomfortably high debt level, inspired some of the worst fears in late 2011. Greece reached a deal with creditors in March, removing the risk of a messy default for now.

"We had moments when we played decent, but they controlled the game all night," Sloan said.
Scott, who is not related to the Wisconsin law professor, suggested that officials may want to consider looking outside the department for more than just the public safety director and police chief. He said the new leaders will need help from key managers who are on the same page and also not burdened by existing relationships or biases.
And Bono (Paul Hewson), guitarist The Edge (Dave Evans), bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen were just the lads to pull it off.
"It means the February session won't be focused on cutting hundreds of millions of dollars from schools, public safety and health care," said House Speaker Dave Hunt, D-Gladstone.
In his early 30s, he dominated U.S. road cycling, winning everything in sight. But he struggled in Europe, returned to the States, won more races and now, at the antique age of 37, he's making his second assault on Europe. To everyone's surprise, including his own, he's peaking on the Astana team, riding alongside seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong and 2007 Tour winner Alberto Contador.

øAll of that said, it is probably better to think of these sorts of opportunities as federal contracts as opposed to free grants. If you do that, then the answer is that yes, there is federal grant money available.
Even with a limited map, both candidates say the election will be — or should be — about big things. (Last week, however, the flap over stay-at-home moms illustrated the inevitable digression into matters that have little to do with voters' main concern, which remains the economy.)
Policymakers expected that by making access to the polls more convenient to underrepresented groups such as minorities and the poor, the cost — defined as time consumed and distance required to travel — would decrease and participation would increase.
But according to the Quinnipiac poll, voters don't buy Kasich's pitch. When asked if they agreed that the new collective bargaining law would help local governments, just 34 percent of voters polled said yes, the lowest total recorded this year by a Quinnipiac poll.

Detroit's Max Scherzer yielded a run and four hits in seven innings. He struck out nine without a walk. Showing none of the control trouble that plagued him in a seven-walk performance last weekend against the Yankees, Scherzer retired the first 11 White Sox before Dunn lined a single to right.
Founded in 1872, the college has 3,000 full- and part-time students and undergraduate degree programs in, arts, sciences, business, education, nursing as well as professional studies.
2. Donnie Brasco (1997): For all of his portrayals of godfathers and Cuban drug lords, Al Pacino's best-ever turn may be in this film, as a low-level wise guy whose struggling crew is infiltrated by an FBI undercover agent (Johnny Depp). This underrated film is one of the best of the 1990s.

An examination of the caloric content of food from about 40 fast-food and sit-down restaurants in three states found that overall the stated calories of items on the menus were accurate. They did note, however, that there were substantial inaccuracies that understated or even overstated calorie figures (the latter is kind of a surprise).
"The Avengers" counter-programming: It takes a brave movie to be squashed at the box office by an über-blockbuster. But on Friday, two films aimed at the comic-book-clueless set are going up against the Marvel extravaganza "The Avengers," which could have one of the biggest opening weekends of the year. "Darling Companion" stars Diane Keaton as a woman devoted to a dog she found on a freeway and Kevin Kline as the husband who could be permanently in the doghouse when he loses the pet. It's directed by U-M alum and former Detroit ad copywriter Lawrence Kasdan. There's also "Damsels in Distress," indie director Whit Stillman's first movie in more than 10 years. It's about a group of female college students who fight the depressed state of an east coast college through good hygiene and musical-dance numbers. The perfect Stillman movie, 1990's "Metropolitan," has already been made, but anything with his odd sensibility is worth seeing.
Del Zotto, who also hit the post with a shot earlier in the period, fired a drive off the crossbar in the final minute that nearly got the Rangers even again.
"I love the way Chuck Berry doesn't waste time in his songs," Jurvanen said. "Even though the lyrics are sometimes cheesy, there's no irony because he did it from a place like, ‘Kids like cars. I'm going to sing about cars. Kids like soda fountains. I'm going to sing about soda fountains.' It was so deliberate. Musically, Neil Young is someone I admire. He doesn't waste a lot of time lyrically. He comes from some pure place where I believe every word. Willie Nelson has always been a fixture, mostly because his singing voice is so strong that he could sing anything and I would believe it.
A. Knee-replacement surgery has improved so much that even your older brother's version isn't your option. Now most docs will tell you to trade in your old joint for a new one when using it causes pain, especially severe pain that inhibits your lifestyle or your ability to stay healthy by being active. Women generally bear pain better than men (yep, we're babies!) and tend to put surgery off until their knees threaten to buckle under them.
Then he met his doppelganger, 36-year-old Sneeh of Syria, who immigrated in 2004. Sneeh taught psychology to troubled teens in Syria, and he wanted to escape the political tyranny in his country and continue teaching in the United States. But because he could not speak English, he took a job in room service at The Inn at Spanish Bay in Pebble Beach, working in a gas station at night. Sneeh sent money home to his younger sister, whom he has cared for since their parents died.
Republicans are trying hard to play this dispute to their advantage and win over religious voters, but they are not playing it smart. President Obama has already blunted most of the impact this issue might have among Catholic voters by compromising on the coverage requirement. As a result, Republicans do not seem to be gaining much traction with their accusations of an attack on religion, except among voters who are already on their side. But they are succeeding in scaring off independent females who are beginning to believe the real Republican agenda is to turn back the clock and limit access to contraceptives.
The goal is to revive the now-comatose basic human urge to snap up lipstick, socks, neckties, designer gowns, jewelry, handbags and all the other goodies that people cut—with a certain pride—from their household budgets after the financial markets crashed last fall and the recession set in.

Ever since the former high-flying party chief of Chongqing was dismissed from his party posts, political insiders and analysts have suggested that the balance of power may have swung toward the reformist wing of the party, led by Premier Wen Jiabao, who has repeatedly called for unspecified political reform in the past two years and who disliked Mr. Bo's top-down model of government and advocate a greater role for civil society and the rule of law.

Cellist Maya Beiser is a worldly creature — raised in Israel to a French mother and Argentine father, Yale-educated, then a founding member of genre-blurring New York ensemble Bang On a Can All-Stars. For her sixth solo release, she commissioned 15-minute works for cello, oud and percussion from the Iranian Kayhan Kalhor (“I Was There” ) and Israeli Tamar Muskal (“Mar de Leche”) plus solo pieces from Armenian icon Djivan Gasparian (the haunted “Memories”) and American Douglas Cuomo. A voluptuous sadness binds the music, underscored by Beiser’s natural feel for the keening cantabile of Middle Eastern music. Her Bang on a Can compatriot Evan Ziporyn’s East-meets-West arrangement of Led Zeppelin’s “Kashmir” (for multi-tracked cello and drums) serves as a dramatic encore.

Evidence of caffeine's cancer-fighting powers has been, uh, brewing for a while. No one exactly understands how caffeine does what it does, but it definitely does something. In this case, the risk of basal cell skin carcinoma is 20 percent lower in women who drink more than three cups a day, compared with women who rarely touch the stuff. Men get protection too, but less, about 9 percent. What's a "cup"? A small, 8-ounce mug, with about 100 milligrams of caffeine. If you're drinking a medium container from a strong-java shop like Starbucks, you're talking 16 ounces and 320 milligrams of caffeine.

As their rubber-soled shoe slows them down, the weight of the adult behind them forces them down the slide, all the while twisting that leg and potentially resulting in a spiral fracture.

It all goes back to a serendipitous single slide, Nagele said. A former student who was working at Johnson & Johnson sent him a brain sample in 1999 for an opinion. When Nagele applied a stain to the brain matter, the tissue darkened to a telltale brown, showing proteins that shouldn’t have been there. It was a Eureka moment, Nagele says now.
"Do you have any idea the politics that have been used to club me over the head and Republicans over the head?" Kasich said. "I think there's nothing inappropriate to the fact of letting people know what we've done, and if people want to help us, that's great. Period, exclamation point."

ORDER A GIN AND JUICE at Booker and Dax, the new bar at the back of David Chang's Momofuku Ssäm Bar, and you'll receive what looks like a wine glass filled with water. Inside it is a mixture of Tanqueray and clarified fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice that is carbonated directly (to achieve fizz without any seltzer). Dave Arnold, 40, who is Mr. Chang's business partner at the bar, is also the drink's "inventor." His Son of a Peach cocktail is made with clarified canned peaches, tweaked for optimum sugar content by adding cane syrup with an electronic refractometer. Lady of the Night, a bloody mary riff, calls for horseradish distilled in a rotary evaporator. Mr. Arnold is currently the French Culinary Institute's director of culinary technology, teaching students how to cook with sous vide machines and transglutaminase, aka "meat glue." He grew up in Englewood, N.J., tinkering in the garage with his father, an electrical engineer, and earned his MFA in sculpture at Columbia before turning his talents to the culinary realm. Sunday afternoons find him at his New York home making dinner for his sons, the original Booker and Dax (10 and 7, respectively), and his wife, architect Jennifer Carpenter.

One reason I can say this with confidence is that the Lifetime Savings Equivalent isn't a lot of money. According to the latest Retirement Confidence Survey done by EBRI, the Employee Benefit Research Institute, only 22 percent of all workers 55 or older had total savings and investments of $250,000 or more. Another 18 percent had total savings between $100,000 and $249,000. At the other end of the scale, 40 percent had total savings under $25,000. So any life decision with a value between $25,000 and $250,000 should get the attention of the millions of people who still work for a living.

But love has driven people to more extreme gestures. (Think "Anna Karenina.") In the end, one remembers the passion, and passion provides this volume with many enlightening and expansive moments. Here Hocking wonders if the odd bedfellows of game and story will someday find chemistry: "The question is, can we go … to completely different realms, using tools that are inherent to games? To let the player play the story, tell his own story, and have that story be deep and meaningful?" Hocking doesn't know, and neither does Bissell. Their uncertainty feels thrilling, testifying to a sense of possibility — and of risk — alien to more established creative forms.
Despite several name changes during the early years of his career, when he went from John Cougar to John Cougar Mellencamp to John Mellencamp, this guitar-strumming singer-songwriter has never wavered in his devotion to heartland rock 'n' roll. He also co-founded Farm Aid. A blunt, blue-collar rocker from Bloomington, Ind., Mellencamp beat the odds to become one of the enduring and respected stars of popular music. He credits at least part of his success to his sheer orneriness. "I've been very fortunate in that I've never been part of anything. I don't really get these guys who wear fur hats in the summertime for the attention. I never had any weird hair to get my songs over. That really has paid off in longevity."

Travel insurance is worth considering, however. For a relatively modest outlay, you can buy coverage that protects you if you have to cancel before or during your trip because you, your traveling companions or even a family member not traveling with you becomes ill and requires care.

But Nick does introduce Rosalie to Monroe. They come to the shop to try and figure out what the bad guys had been looking for. "I knew your brother," Monroe tells Rosalie, sticking out his hand. "I'm sorry." They look around and find "J," which isn't illegal, but, Monroe says, is so addictive it's like "meth mixed with rat poison and helium." Rosalie's not letting him go without double-checking something, though -- she grabs his arm and gets all fuchsbau. Monroe responds by going blutbad. "I just wanted to make sure," Rosalie says.

Borger said in his filings that the First Amendment requires parties who seek to restrict public access to court documents to demonstrate a compelling reason why the information should be kept secret.

Now some Republicans are trying to find a way to squirm out of the defense cuts that are part of the penalty for the supercommittee's failure. President Obama is quite right to promise to veto any such legislation. The Pentagon budget surely needs to be reduced in order to bring down the deficit, but across-the-board cuts aren't the best way to do it. Still, a belief in Washington that there need be no consequences for a failure to act responsibly is what got us in this mess in the first place. The mandatory cuts the nation now faces don't go into effect until 2013, so there is theoretically time to strike a deal before the most damaging effects of the supercommittee's collapse are felt. But that won't happen if Congress votes to remove the noose it placed around its own neck.

Ehrlich Jr. aide Paul Schurick's conviction this week on fraud charges related to an election night 2010 robocall that urged voters in Democratic households to "relax" and stay home, Mr. Schurick's defenders have begun to criticize the law on which he was found guilty.

The primary differences among them are how quickly they can shoot photos and the range of shooting settings. I ended up choosing 60D, which was the middle model of the three, because it had a great range of shooting options. Plus, I didn't want to spend several hundred dollars more just to take one or two more pictures per second, which was the main difference between it and the 7D.

Whoa, pretty thick.How about ending the week with "Housewives" dish? A few floors down from Nguyen v. Nguyen yesterday I witnessed a slice of Waring v. Waring - the ongoing entanglements of Lauri Waring and her ex-husband, Phil. Phil doesn't think Lauri needs the $1,500 a month he's been paying her in spousal support - considering she's living with George Peterson, who lavishes her with cars, jewelry and clothes. I don't know why she is even contesting Phil's motion. I mean, what is $1,500 a month to her any longer? Gas for the Mercedes AMG that George bought her?

If you go by the most basic definition of pizza -- bread with a garnish -- the flatbread that Zoe Nathan turns out at Huckleberry, her month-old Santa Monica bakery, definitely qualifies. OK, she doesn't have a wood-burning oven, which makes it even more remarkable what she does with a regular deck oven. I suspect her secret is to lavish the dough with olive oil, which crisps and caramelizes the edges beautifully. She features a different flatbread every day: I loved one topped with kale, onions and raisins. Another day, it might be potato and onion, or zucchini blossoms, or even sprouting broccoli. You basically get a 6-inch-by-6-inch slab of heaven. To go or eat in.
