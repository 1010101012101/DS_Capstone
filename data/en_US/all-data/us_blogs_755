Growler’s Pub (3811 South Lindbergh Boulevard, Sunset Hills) South St. Louis County is kind of a dead spot when it comes to craft beer, but if you’re stuck down there, you’ll always be able to find an oasis in Growlers. While it may not boast the most unique selection of beers in the area, it always has something interesting on tap and the food is consistently good.

I’m not going to lie, when I was 7 I had a slight crush on Brian from the Backstreet Boys, but this wasn’t because I enjoyed his heart-wrenching cheese filled lyrics. He was just so dreamy. When I was seven and all of my friends hopped on the Boy band-wagon I had little option but to follow. Listen to BSB or be ostracized from the “Pit.” The Pit being the dent on the side of the soccer field where all the cool kids hung out a recess and listened to their Walkmans and chewed Double Bubble by the fistful. So I suffered through it, until I was about 10 and common sense kicked in. Reflecting now, I realize something in my brain just never clicked with pop music.

And remember how there is always going to be someone behind you and someone in front of you and someone running over you or pushing you out of the way, someone who sets up circle-roadblocks in front of you—but if you stop the mad dash round and round and appreciate each experience, you will find some peace.

I had a ton of stuff hanging on my walls that I really didn't think fit the look or feel I was going for, so most of this went straight into storage boxes. Other stuff I decided to take with me. It really isn't that stressful when I broke it down as only removing the things on my wall instead of trying to tackle a floor to ceiling area like I had been dreading.

The most important in learning photography as a beginner is to practice and experiment by yourself, but it could be good to learn the basics in how a photo is supposed to be taken. If you don’t know the basics, your photography experience might lead to frustration and anger. Photography is all about light so start off with shutter speed and aperture. As a beginner in photography and if you the passion to be a good photographer we advise you to take up this course and learn to click pictures around you.

In Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior (Pantheon), physicist Leonard Mlodinow, coauthor of The Grand Design with Stephen Hawking, gives us a startling and eye-opening examination of how the unconscious mind shapes our experience of the world. Employing his trademark wit and lucid, accessible explanations of the most obscure scientific subjects, Mlodinow unravels the complexities of the subliminal self, increasing our understanding of how the human mind works and how we interact with others. Cosponsored by the OHSU Brain Institute.
We are dealing with a race that is infinitely fragmented into tribal and ethnic divisions, sub divisions, languages, dialects and others defining separatist mechanisms that makes defining them as simply as “Black People” outrageously simplistic and myopic if any effort is to be made to understand the absolute inability of these people to contribute anything constructive or positive to humanity.

It also has a heavy personal resonance in that, my dad's sperm and my mum's eggs and womb aside, I made me. Of course, I inherited DNA and other elements that influence me but I made me and only I have the power to destroy me. The feeling that your life is in your hands and that you can make it or break it and that no excuses should be made, or blamed laid for failures and foibles. The same goes for life's successes, they do not belong to anyone but you, they can be shared but you did them.
Last week I sat in my two and a half hour Health Psychology class and we somehow got on the subject of Human Anatomy and Physiology. I was answering questions about topics that I forgot I had even learned. I was having so much fun. So much fun that I began to miss when I was always surrounded by the sciences. I began to miss when I was majoring in Biology aspiring to become a Dermatologist. I began to miss the medical conferences. I thought I was beginning to miss the past. For those who have not read my post, I am Going To Be A Dermatologist; God is the source concerning why I am no longer majoring in Biology and He is the reason why I now realize that my life is not my own, including my dreams and aspirations. I had to snap out of my reminiscing session. As I reflect on times spent with my old “friends” and partying habits—I sometimes feel like I am missing out on fun since coming to know the Lord. RED FLAG! RED FLAG! I know for a fact that I was previously admiring sin, flirting with death, and asking to go on dates with the devil so WHY would any of that appear favorable in my new eyes? Because more of my flesh has to die while I concentrate on bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ (2 Corinthians 10:5) .God made it clear: You don’t know what I know. I took you from that place for a reason. Now if you want to return to your own vomit, that is on you (Proverbs 26:11). But let me make it clear–I am the way and the truth and the light (John 14:6). Find refuge in Me and don’t be fooled (Psalm 31:4). Be still and know that I am God (Psalm 46:10).

When we lived in Powassan, four hours north of Toronto, we had many friends we still keep in touch with. Two special friends Barry and I love very much are Bonnie and Jim. When we lived down the street from Bonnie and Jim, we had our girls, Kathy and Heather. Bonnie and Jim wanted children too, so they adopted two girls. Barry still in social work back then, was doing placements of babies with Childrens' Aid.... and so he was instrumental in getting children for Bonnie and Jim. Like Kathy and Heather, Bonnie and Jim's daughters are all grown up now and starting lives of their own.

Form the dime. Place the dime on the ring mandrel. Shape the dime so it is the same arc as the ring. To do so, place the dime on the ring mandrel at the same size as the ring. Position the dime so the line for the ring size is in the center of the dime. Hit the dime with the raw hide mallet. The shape will be sloped. To even out the dime, turn the dime over so it faces the opposite way and hit the dime again with the rawhide
China’s Defence Budget for 2012 continues to follow anticipated trend lines in keeping with its plan of carrying out Revolution in Military Affairs in a calibrated, coordinated and comprehensive manner. The actual figures of the Chinese Defence budget continues to be a source of conjecture and no standard factors can assist in accurate prediction of the real expenditure. The allocation for 2012 appears to suggest that ‘it is business as usual’ for the PLA, although there are reports of a substantial rise in salaries and expenditure on improving the living standards even as it finds new ways to woo young men and women to join the PLA. It would be prudent to assume that the bulk of the monies will be directed at ensuring domination of the Asia- Pacific by developing its ‘ Anti-Access Area Denial’ strategies while building on a nascent expeditionary capability for power projection and protection of its interests globally. As far as India is concerned, we will see no let up in the momentum of infrastructure development in the TAR and the possible establishment of the PLA`s first base overseas in the Indian Ocean in the near future.

And the $64,000 question: Are users of these sites really interested in my wargaming site? Answer "no": It is a 'black' server reading of a list of URL's trying to generate back traffic to steal identity information. In effect this is a modified version of a "phish" attack - as in "click me" you'll be rich. Why doesn't Google block it, well from the techie side of things the traffic profile is the same as legitimate referrals, it is only over time can Google detect odd things in traffic patterns - which is a little "after the horse has bolted".

The notion of “low-risk populations” is what caught my eye. I suspect that most of the uproar over this video, and over the enhanced screenings in general, arise from folks who consider themselves members of a low-risk population. Of course, it helps that the subject of this particular video is a white female child – described by Jennifer Abel as reminiscent of JonBenet Ramsey.
But in publishing, it seems, it's rare for things to happen all at once, especially on one day. Traditionally publishing is a painfully slow business. There is so much waiting, waiting, waiting, for everything. There are little spikes of excitement, I've found, but they rarely snowball into anything super-exciting. It's like, WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. WRITE. WRITE. QUERY. SUB. SUB. SUB. SUB. WAIT FOREVER. WRITE. WRITE. WAIT. Agent! Book Deal! Publisher! WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. TRY TO WRITE. WAIT FOREVER. Cover! WAIT. WAIT. WRITE. WRITE. WAIT. WORK. Edits! WAIT. EDIT. WAIT. EDIT. WAIT. More edits! WAIT. EDIT FOREVER. WAIT. WAIT. WRITE. Blurbs from Awesome Authors! WAIT. WAIT. WRITE. WAIT. Oh my gosh, I get to hold my book! WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. Release day! WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. WRITE. Oh, look, good reviews! My book on a shelf! WAIT. WAIT. WRITE. WRITE. SUB. WRITE. SUB. WAIT FOREVER. Another book deal! And then we start over. Of course, individual mileage may vary for every author, but my point is there is a freaking ton of waiting.

The beautifully-detailed space I referenced in my last blog (“Life: Look and Learn”) did possess one opportunity for improvement. Scattered through the room were three large, flat-screen televisions. The potential for sensory confusion was minimized, as they were all on the same station, but even so, they interrupted the tranquil, beautiful space and robbed it of its perfection. I reflected on how often this happens in many social spaces designed for elders. We design these areas for sharing time, interacting, playing games and puzzles, and relating to one another . . . yet always, always with a place for the TV and extra cable connections for future TVs.

He has the second-highest winning percentage in club-history (.627, 31-19) among pitchers with at least 400 innings. Despite that note, Harison has not done well against Detroit, with an overall career record of 1-4 against the Tigers, compiling a 6.89 ERA in seven games (five starts vs Detroit).

The headlines heralding this World Championships revolved around Allyson Felix’ attempt at a double, and Usain Bolt continuing his championship domination – both of which went by the wayside with Bolt’s false start and Felix’ oh so close silver in the 400. There was also the comeback of LaShawn Merritt which also ended in silver and the summit meeting of the three fastest hurdlers in history in the men’s 110 hurdles, which went to up and coming Jason Richardson. This meet has not been kind to those in the headlines! Or to favorites in general, just ask Jessica Ennis about her javelin debacle in the Heptathlon.

Charles Lederer wanted to turn the world on its ear. He did not just one but two series of the sort where you look at the cartoon normally, then turn it over to (ideally) see an entirely different picture formed from the same cartoon. He wasn't the first nor the best at this genre. In the comic strip realm the gold standard is the famed Sunday comics series UpsideDowns of Little Lady Lovekins and Old Man Muffaroo by Gustave Verbeck. Outside newspaper comics there was Peter Newell's Topsys & Turvys, for my money the true masterpiece of the genre -- see a very cool online animated version of book 1 at NonsenseLit. Also be sure to get a copy of the cheap but excellent Tuttle Publishing reprint of the books (far better than the old Dover editions).

Such were the differences between the regimes usually called fascist that a really adequate answer would be a book-length enterprise so let me just list my conclusions followed by a few explanatory notes: In addition to Hitler, Mussolini and Peron, the true Fascists of the pre-war period were Dollfuss in Austria, Pilsudski in Poland, Mosley in Britain and Chiang Kai Shek in China. They were all clearly both socialists and nationalists and to varying degrees had many other trappings of Mussolini's Fascism too -- such as militarism and a liking for uniforms. Franco in Spain and Salazar in Portugal were only semi-Fascist. Tojo in Japan, Horthy in Hungary, Antonescu in Romania, Pavelic in Croatia were simply nationalists rather than Fascists. In more recent times Papadopoulos in Greece, Pinochet in Chile and Suharto in Indonesia were just common or garden variety military dictators. Military government is of course the rule rather than the exception throughout history. It was even the rule rather than the exception in ancient Greece. Pinochet, Suharto and Papadopoulos are sometimes mentioned as Fascists purely because they had significant far-Left opponents. It may be noted that their cultural backgrounds are quite different: Catholic, Muslim and Orthodox.

The Indian pale ale for export is brewed as follows :—68 lb. of best hops are used for 1000 lb. of pale malt; 60 lb. of the hops are digested separately with 108 lb. of water at 75° C., and allowed to infuse. This hop infusion is added to the wort, which is then boiled with 8 lb. of hops. The author suggests that the hop infusion extracts the tannin of the hops, which precipitates the albuminoids of the wort during boiling, and the greenish shade is produced.

We headed into Kopf Family Reservation, and I finally checked my watch. I was cruising at a sub 8:30 pace and feeling pretty good.

During my “starving artist” period, some time in the last century, I found myself doing just about anything to make a buck. Shortly before working as a sorority house security guard, but right after the funeral home telemarketing gig, I hired on with the County to work Election night. I went to an office downtown, fully expecting to dazzle the officials who were doing the hiring with the details of all my years of political campaign work, but they didn’t care–they were just looking for warm bodies.
The current, exact state of his father’s mental health is not Jeremy’s only worry. He has returned to Vancouver to open his own restaurant, the aptly named “Monkey’s Paw,” where he idealistically hopes to produce food which will remind people of “what the soil under their feet has to offer.” Good intentions aside, it’s an expensive, risky undertaking; he finds the business end of things a bit beyond him. Soon, despite the restaurant’s rising popularity, he is teetering on the brink of economic ruin.

I won’t sit here and pretend that I have God, faith, and religion all figured out. I don’t think there is anyone on this earth who could ever fully grasp the vastness of it all. Ultimately God wants a relationship with us, and what ever vehicle gets us there is all that matters. Arguing about religion is almost as silly as arguing about Ford vs. Chevy. One can point fingers and admonish the other driver for his lack of discernment. They can argue about the superior horsepower of one over the other, plaster “Piss on __________ ” stickers all over the back of their trucks, all in attempt to one up the other. But does it REALLY make a difference? At the end of the day, both trucks have 4 wheels, an engine, the ability to get people from point A to point B, and sometimes out of messy situations. In my opinion there is no “right” or “wrong” way. So it is with our faith.
By the time 2010 ends, President Obama will have been politically neutered.

Also, there are too many parents of young kids spouting opinions about raising older kids when they know nothing about it yet.

No, he had his hands clenched to his face, holding his eyelids apart.

It's mostly the blood and guts worship that I do not buy. That knocks out ninety percent of Catholicism and many other sects.

I think slavery was around longer than the church. So does that make it correct?

This is a time when it's super, super important to TRY BEFORE YOU BUY!! There are rental programs online where you can select a variety of carriers (wraps, ring slings, structured, whatever) and try them out. If you're doing it before the baby arrives, I recommend using a bag of sugar or flour to approximate the weight of a baby and walk around with it. Yes, you'll look like a damn fool, but when you are able to get the perfect carrier for yourself you'll thank me! I rented the Ergo Performance, the Beco Gemini, and a carrier from Olives and Applesauce from PaxBaby.com's carrier rental program. Of the three, I much preferred the Beco (though it is padded and therefore HOT in the middle of summer in Nebraska). But again, I highly recommend that you rent a few yourself and see which works for your body and baby. We also have a ring sling and a wrap (ZoloWear and SleepyWrap, respectively) that I really like as well. Each carrier serves a different purpose: the soft structured carrier (like Becco) is great for walks and hiking and more active outings; the ring sling is great to pop the baby in for a quick trip to the grocery store, and the wrap is great for wearing around the house. You can also nurse easily in the ring sling and wrap. But regardless of which route you go, a good carrier is essential for those times when the baby just wants to be held and by golly you have things you want to get done that require more than one hand!
“Six weeks before broadcast (15 March 2012) I drew the attention of the programme makers to a number of important facts related to the 1975 church inquiry into Brendan Smyth, which the programme failed to report and which I now wish to restate for all other media who report on this matter:

As I read through the pages of mostly poetry written as a teenager, the underlying themes were of love, friendship and loneliness. Instead of providing inspiration, they simply made me feel more uninspired. Even the first person “semi-autobiographical” narrative by James Thurber failed to light the creative flame.

Serendipitously, Atheists have charged FORWARD (thanks Barack) into the closet, denying that they even have an hypothesis to substantiate. This is in response to the request that they provide analytical evidence for their position of rejecting either the existence of a non-physical agent, or rejecting the hypothesis cum deduction indicating that hypothesis to be rationally acceptable. The dash for the closet is a better indicator of the rational, analytical powers of Atheists than the answer to a single algebra question, because it is a specific response by a specific group to a specific issue which provides differentiation of the actual issue, whereas algebra is not an issue in either religion or Atheism, much less a differentiator.

Dean Adams is then seen getting ready to go home as well. He pauses at the car door to look into the back seat, then smiles at how much the urban legends have started to get on his nerves. A hand grabs his shoulder, but it turns out to be Reese. She starts to list all of the students who have either died or gone missing, and the dean tells her not to worry or call the police. Weird.
Things have taken a turn in Sag's dreaming of acquiring a PC laptop. He has wanted one for months and months. It has been a desire born of playing Minecraft, which can be played on a Mac, but delving into the world of gaming, which like the "real" world, operates majorly on PCs. There have been paths of play and curiosity he has not been able to follow, limited by being on an Apple machine.

This was the CW's first visit to Sin City, and it figured to to be interesting to see it through her eyes; I expected that she was going to hate it. I can't say that she did, but I can say that it isn't going to be a destination for either of us. Neither of us are gamblers (unless you want to count my love of very-low-stakes home poker games). The food in Vegas, quite frankly, sucks. At least it used to be cheap, but now you don't even have that to recommend it (and it's expensive not only in the casinos but also far away from The Strip). And there's something sadly amusing about the blatant sex. Maybe it's because of my years on the road and having it shoved in my face, but something about the advertising of it basically says "if you don't get it anywhere else, at least you can get it here." And frankly, that is sad. Based on the tourists I see whenever I'm there, though, the message is hitting the target audience.

Being inspired by all of the wall stripes and stencils I've recently seen popping up in blogland, I thought this might be a fun way to decorate some Easter eggs - using a stencil or possibly masking tape to paint plaid and polka dot Easter eggs.
Most people love American Psycho, because it was literally fun to watch, and had kind of a light ending. We do too, but greatly prefer Rules Of Attraction to American Psycho, as it was fun (and even psychedelic) to watch, while having a real nihilist feel to it. It’s one of my favorite movies ever.
Scotsman Sean Buckley is best known for his single with The Breadcrumbs, "Everybody Knows". When this fine slice of proto-freakbeat sank without a trace, he went to Germany with a new outfit, The Sean Buckley Set, where he recorded a soul-flavoured LP and this non-LP single for Hit House. The band toured here for about a year, and I remember a tremendous 30 minutes live set on the radio show "Mittwochsparty", broadcasted by SDR Stuttgart. "Please Do Something", a Don Covay song, is better known in the version of The Spencer Davis Group. +++
I did it! I put on my big girl skirt (one I made, of course) and hit the studio.
We moved my middlest college student home on Sunday. Her lease was up and she didn't want to renew until she knows what her sister wants to do. So she is going to drive back and forth to school for the next 2 1/2 months. Her brother was in Houston on business so he came by to help load the heavy stuff and we all went to eat at the original Ninfa's in Houston.
Time for my sanity to once again start wicking away with every passing moment.
After the great meal (not sure if it was the aphrodisiac effects of oysters, but felt huge love for oysters!) we were treated to oyster-free desserts from the regular menu. Chaya's signature dessert is their Milk Chocolate Croissant Bread Pudding with Caramel Ice Cream ($9) which was delicious with its buttery, light, layered pastry a departure from the normally dense, heavy bread puddings at other restaurants.

It was a lovely day out, and could be combined with section 1 or 3 if you start early enough.
Not only has she gathered all of us together, but she has also got me off of my duff, to prepare for the 4th. Usually I procrastinate until the last minute, but today I am happy to share with you the tradition my husband & I now share. At one time we either worked very hard to have a barbecue here, or traveled somewhere to help friends & family. Once our children moved from this area, we decided to start new traditions. (Way better than me sitting around & crying) We now work around the house & yard during the day, then start our celebration.
At any rate, this is a man who sang – and drew a picture of his wife – on his deathbed. “‘Stay Kate,’ he said, ‘keep just as you are – I will draw your portrait – for you have ever been an angel to me.’” His friend George Richmond (the artist who later drew the flattering portrait head of Charlotte Bronte) wrote to Samuel Palmer,
Pennywell Folsom no longer lies alone in deep Georgia woods. Around his grave, the Rountrees placed their own dead, until this burying ground became known as the Rountree Cemetery. This cemetery is located in present day Cook county , on Evergreen Church Road (CR 99), near the intersection with Rountree Bridge Road (CR 251) (see map). Around 1945, the present Evergreen Church was constructed adjacent to Rountree Cemetery, the original church building located on Rountree Bridge Road having been destroyed by fire.

A few folk have waved away this concern. "It doesn't matter where you're published, as long as you're published," some say. "If you're good enough, you'll shine through. Persistence will pay off. Eventually, the larger publishers who pay more will recognize you and be forced to buy your manuscripts and market you."

Ava herself is one of my favourite new characters. She’s just got it together, and I love that she can by turns break noses and charm foreign diplomats, that if she needs to promise hundreds of thousands of dollars or blackmail sleazeballs, she doesn’t balk. My book club often discusses the success of one gender writing the other. Often it just doesn’t work, and a very male writing style will mar a supposedly female point of view (or vice versa). Hamilton handles his young Chinese-Canadian female lead with grace and authenticity. There are, perhaps, a few too many mentions of her slipping her panties on and off, or taking out a “clean bra” each day (this might be a male misconception of how lingerie works or just one of Ava’s character traits), and I’m not sure if this comes of the overly obsessive attention to detail that permeates the book or if this is the pitfall of writing from the opposing gender’s point of view.
Our go-to breakfast is steel cut oatmeal prepared overnight in our rice cooker. It’s as simple as adding water to steel cut oats and prepping the timer so it’s ready when we awake. But, sometimes those three simple steps escape my memory and we are left scrambling for breakfast ideas as we leave for school. Or, even worse – a preschooler who is counting on oatmeal when she wakes up and I forgot to get it ready. An unhappy 3-year-old is never.a.good.idea. Nature’s Path Organic has a wonderful selection of microwaveable hot cereals that vary from Flax Plus to Multigrain Raisin Spice. They are all scrumptious and ready in under two minutes. I appreciate that the ingredients are natural and the sweeteners are evaporated cane juice and real maple syrup. At around 50-cents a serving, it’s a very affordable, healthy last minute breakfast that fills you up with hearty goodness.
We managed to enjoy our families in 2009. We were able to see four of the five children in person, along with their children. We didn’t make it out to Las Vegas, but we were able to virtually visit thanks to phone calls, text messages and video calls. Our faithful Prius took us to Hendersonville every other week (sometimes more often than that) to help my folks. That involved a lot of miles, but my parents appreciate each and every trip we make.
It seems that Adam and Eve were lonely and were being their usual whingeing, complaining human selves (see 'Sick Notes' by G.P. Dr Tony Copperfield, yesterday's Post), so God said "I will create a companion for you, and regardless of how selfish or childish or unlovable you may be, this companion will always love you as I do, and will always accept your many faults".

Every year at Christmas, Emily and her mother would go into the city to the big stores to do their Christmas shopping, they would spend the day shopping and looking at the windows on the street which were full of toys and beautiful Christmas decorations. After their day, they would have dinner at a nice restaurant where the tables had white tablecloths and napkins to match. Mommy showed her how to lay the napkin across her lap. The man who brought their food wore a black suit with shoes so shiny Emily could almost see her face in them. Mommy told her to be polite and say thank you when he brought her food, but when he put her food in front of her he bowed and then clicked his heels. Unable to help herself, Emily asked him if he had seen The Wizard of Oz (her very favouritist movie), because his heel clicks reminded her of Dorothy. The man smiled kindly at Emily and said that of course, that was his favourite movie. He always clicked his heels at Christmas because his family lived far away and he, like Dorothy wanted to be home with them, especially at Christmas time.
The other side character that I loved was the Doctor. I thought his placement in the plot was a good one. I wasn’t sure in the beginning what direction his character would take. But in the end I thought it was very smart, what Ms. Meyer did. Very interesting indeed. But I’ll let you read it yourself and figure it out.

I'm not saying that by looking for the beauty in life, you'll never get down or discouraged - that's a total normal thing to experience. It's when we let that sadness/anger/negativity control our lives that we're too clouded to ever see the positive (and I love you all too much to want you to feel that way!).

My goal, at first, wasn't to limit them in their play. It was to help them learn to appreciate what they have, at the same time learning economics (earnings, savings, spending, etc.) it was just a blessed surprise to realize it was also a great behavioral tool!
And, given what today is, Spirit Day, and why this occasion has come about, I think not only of the hope that all of us wish and hope impels young people at risk of suicide to not take their lives because “there’s always hope,” nonetheless it is disheartening when all of the hope and promise of youths are cut down in their prime in such horrific ways because hope wasn’t enough for them. As Spes herself holds the blooming flower, so too have the dying youths often been memorialized as flowers. And in such situations, where hope is the last thing in their minds, I think Spes herself weeps, and joins in the words of the Tebtynis Papyrus in relation to the flower-heroes and Antinous as she looks at the dying flower in her own hand, “Someone will gather garlands of lamented names, and will lament more the youth of the dying men.”

This model is not fool proof or necessarily more productive than the teacher directed model. But, as a parent interested in taking part in my children’s education, it does mean fewer battles over trapezoids. Ultimately, I also hope it means more interesting conversations with my kids as we stumble together through the forest of possibilities that is the world in which we live. I just need to get better at staying out of the way.

But most fantasy accepts that there is more to the world than meets the eye or brushes the hand. From the reality of gods of all shapes and sizes, to strange mythical creatures, to the ability of humanity to wield forces unimaginable with no more than our wills. Fantasy is all about exploring that which is beyond our human knowledge and our mortal strength. It reminds us that reality is more than what we can see, touch, smell, taste and hear. Fantasy allows us to believe, even if only for the span of a book, in fairies and monsters and gods and demons. Fantasy lets us be more than we could ever dream to be in this "real" world.
This is a first post on a series covering one of the most common elements in any software application design i.e. the wizard.
Even amid all the world-building and scenery of Dreadnought, Priest proves she still excels with creating believable characters you want to root for with her powerful, independent, and strong willed women always being the stand outs. Priest is creating quite a cadre of strong-willed women willing to do almost anything to accomplish their goal. Mercy is perhaps her masterpiece to date as she faces down all perils and takes aback men merely with the look from her steely eyes and nursing abilities. Also, always remember every good Southern girl knows how to shoot a gun.
In the season finale of the ABC series Castle, the crime novelist and title character helps NYPD detective Kate Beckett pursue the man who shot her.
So what values are important to you? What are the truths that you hold dear? Isn’t it time you write them down and build the foundation of your great company upon them? Yes it IS that important.

I realized today, that I have alluded to this feeling of things getting a little crazy in at least two of my recent posts. Yesterday I had BIG plans to "finish" one of my projects, so I could cross it off my to do list, and also so that I could post about it.
I make a living (or rather am working hard at building a living) from my recipes both food and home art. Creation of good to eat victuals and healthy home products from heritage and/or natural ingredients are a passion for me. It is so thrilling when someone asks for a recipe or how to make a specific soap. What is the saying?
I try out DOGTV, which is free of ads, one Saturday night when I think Chloe is looking a bit subdued and possibly bored. There is an introduction to the programming, with a scientist (or maybe it was an actor) telling us about the great benefits of the channel, available on-demand all day. When the introduction finishes, the screen dims and a weird light show with sound effects starts up. Lights move across the screen and there is barking and noises. Chloe is still stubbornly lying on the sofa. She hasn’t even looked up.
Regardless of some odd design choices I still rather like this it.
Proper timing is crucial for everything. But sometimes I often find myself attempting to create the proper time. I find myself getting impatient and pushing matters. I see the watch on my wrist, I see the grey hairs on my head and I think my time is running short. But God always gently reminds me that it’s not too late. It’s never too late for God. Look at Abraham and Sarah…she thought she was too old to bear a child, yet God blessed them, and blessed the nations through Abraham and Sarah!! That’s a heck of a testimony of God’s perfect timing. His proper timing. We need not rush matters. At the proper time God sent His only son. At the proper time, God saved me from sin. At the proper time, everything! If I am truly walking His path, then the challenge must be to work on being patient. Work on allowing God to take the wheel. I imagine Gandalf whispering to me, “A wizard is never late, nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means to…”

If you are new to playing poker online it might be tempting to start at the free tables that all online poker rooms offer. However if you are serious about playing poker for money and want to develop into a solid player, do not spend too much time at the free tables. The object of the poker is to win money and that is real money, when you take this most important part out of the game it is never the same. Players act completely different when it comes down to their own money when compared to free games. Spend just enough time to get familiar with the software and the features and move on before you picked up some very dangerous habits.

Hendrix believes the purpose of marriage is to address these emotional traumas and “help each other finish childhood”. “You don’t heal childhood in therapy,” he says. “You don’t do it with a book; you don’t do it alone. You have to have somebody who’s significant to you respond to your needs in a specific way, because your unconscious mind responds primarily to a particular kind of person who is similar to the people you were around in childhood.”

I don’t hesitate to say that damage or destruction of the land-community is morally wrong, just as Leopold did not hesitate to say so when he was composing his essay, “The Land Ethic,” in 1947. But I do not believe, as I think Leopold did not, that morality, even religious morality, is an adequate motive for good care of the land-community. The primary motive for good care and good use is always going to be affection, because affection involves us entirely. And here Leopold himself set the example. In 1935 he bought an exhausted Wisconsin farm and, with his family, began its restoration. To do this was morally right, of course, but the motive was affection. Leopold was an ecologist. He felt, we may be sure, an informed sorrow for the place in its ruin. He imagined it as it had been, as it was, and as it might be. And a profound, delighted affection radiates from every sentence he wrote about it.

Overall, I was uninspired by most of what I saw in theaters, with the exception of some 2007 holdovers that I didn’t get a chance to see until the start of the new year. Here’s a shortlist of some of my favorite films watched in 2008, in alphabetical order –
Don't even get me started on mittens. Specifically, the inability of mittens to stay on the hand, and the insanity of watching a two-year-old yank off her mitten in frustration, plunge her bare hand into the snow, and then scream because she has no mitten.

When it comes to food, we’re talking about supporting GMO (genetically modified organism) farming which means supporting companies like Monsanto.
What we typically call ‘plastics’ (bags, bowls, bottles et cetera) are not usually very stretchy materials. Some plastic bags can be stretched before they rip but that doesn’t mean they are elastic. You see, what we mean by ‘elastic’ is not just how much it can stretch but also whether the material goes back to how it was before it was stretched. Given a piece of elastic band of a given shape and length, you can stretch it and let go and it will return to its original length and shape as though it didn’t suffer any deformation. However, it you try and stretch a plastic bag, its handles might elongate but, once you let go, they won’t return to their original length and shape. This is the difference between ‘elastic’ and ‘plastic’ materials.
Talk to your child in a friendly manner instead of blasting out at him/her. Ask what is the problem and if there is any reason for not liking school for for their behavior. Many a times there are reasons like bullying, being away from parents, tough assignments or a teacher they may not like. Talk to his teacher or probably a school counselor would be able to help your child.

There is something exuberant about the right peplum (the wrong kind just brings to mind Pat Butcher in a saloon bar). In skilled hands the right peplum can accentuate boyish hips, create the illusion of a hand-span waists and mask less-than-flat tummies, making it very much the go-to post-Christmas-gym-not-quite-kicked-in-yet item. Shortly there will plenty to choose from. Thakoon, Jason Wu, Acne, Dries van Noten, Peter Pilotto and Osman are just some of the designers who’ve taken it up. Preen added them to the waistbands of trousers. Dior, under the current helm of designer Bill Gaytten, has revived the 1947 Bar jacket again. At Celine, Phoebe Philo designed a large detachable peplum belt, which, brilliantly, works over skirts, trousers and even dresses and, not so brilliantly, costs £750. It will probably get copied though – just as all the more straightforward peplums have been. Zara has an especially chic looking black peplum skirt for £49.99 (on their website they’re calling it, prosaically, Skirt with Frill).
The principles of what this helps are simple. Wood that is buried and is slowly rotting tends to absorb water. Anyone who has tried to light a fire with wood that's been sitting on moist ground can tell from the smokiness that the wood absorbed water. Basically, water acts as a sponge, so having a mass of it in your garden bed acts as a resevoir for some water, reducing and eventually eliminating the need for irrigation. In the first year or two, depending on how decomposed the wood you piled up was to begin with, you'll see some reduction in irrigation needs, but you'll still need to water once in awhile unless the rain is frequent enough (and even then, you probably will have to once in a while. The decomposing wood also adds nutrients slowly to the soil, eventually becoming extremely rich soil that itself holds a lot of water.

As I sat down today, I not only looked back at this last week, but also glanced back at the last several weeks of this pantry challenge. I noticed a pattern that has emerged in my meal planning... I don't think there has been more than one week in which I completely stuck to my planned menu. This is not terribly surprising as 'life happens' every week and that is ok with me. It did make me thankful that I intentionally build a lot of flexibility into my menu plans.
To activate, the user holds down the home button for a couple of seconds (loads much quicker than Voice Control because of the A5 chip/RAM) and then the microphone interface “slides up” from the bottom in a clever animation. The speech interface doesn’t cover your entire view, just about the bottom fourth of the display – like the multitasking/app-switcher function. The feature even works from the lock screen.

Bigger girls do tend to get “ignored” in social settings, such as clubs, pubs, parties etc. So we have to have a personality that draws people to us and makes them look beyond the number on the tag of our clothes. If we attract a guy’s notice, it’s not because you can see Tasmania at the bottom of our skirt, it’s because of our personality.
Tomorrow is a hike, so you'll get a break from the flower show. The temperatures are unseasonably ridiculous (supposed to break records again... I've been wearing shorts all week), but things are still brown and gray. I'll try for a couple of worthy pictures, though.

Thor always held a touch of the exotic for me when I was a child. He represented an alien strain of religious mania, which contradicted my own. The comics marbled the superhero stories with strands of Norse myth. It was a bastardization, having the New Mutants duke it out with Loki in the snowy interior of Canada, but combining the two made a peculiar sort of sense. Marvel was smart. They had the Greek gods, too. Thor’s best friend on the Avengers, for a while, was Hercules. And a major storyline, 20 or so years ago, had the Egyptian gods attempting to destroy all the other pantheons. Odin and Zeus had to work together, with some human heroes thrown in for good measure. It was kooky, silly, and awesome. (Black Knight, rigidifying into a human sword, was used to destroy Set at the crucial juncture.) This irrational mashup of cultures and mythologies is precisely what I’ve always loved about comics; they exist as some omega point where all stories collapse into.
My ankle didn't turn any pretty colors or swell too awful much later on and I think that has a lot to do with the fact I put ice on it right away, plus, I'm not an easy bruiser, it takes a LOT to get me to bruise. Apparently the new treatment for sprains is to resume normal activity ASAP so I got sent back to work, didn't run any calls after it happened but I did yesterday and it was challenging, my ankle is still a little tender and even with the air cast they gave me. I have two days off lets hope I can recuperate some more before having to go back!
Have you “done good” for years? Have you ever, in the quiet of your heart, in those times of doubt, secretly wondered when and if you were ever going to reap the benefits? Perhaps you might be wondering why you even bother doing the Father’s will. Have you tallied up your deeds and sacrifices and decided you’ve got a higher, bigger stack of “good” than others? Or maybe you’ve watched others and were resentful of the amount of “payback” they have received. Or, perhaps you have done good and wished you hadn’t, and plan on stingily holding back in the future. “Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve.” Colossians 3:23, 24.
As I approached the woods through the fog along the winding country roads yesterday morning, I thought of you and the pictures of you and your son from your Colorado mountain hiking adventure. The fog did not blanket the park as it had the roads from town. I found the trailhead of the big woods trail hike that I wanted to follow through the nature preserve. I did not have much time before needing to depart for my return trip.

That’s what gum has become. We, the nation of big-fat-fatty-fatasses has to be eating every second of every day. But if we did that, we’d explode. So, we use gum as a means to keep our mouths occupied so we don’t accidently shove your own young into our mouthes and eat them like gerbils.
The house is about the same size. There is more land. And the neighborhood it's in was hit by a tornado three weeks ago (the house and, more importantly, our friends who currently live there are fine). We're looking at building a storm shelter as soon as we move in.

“Indeed, since the photographic image is made by the action of light, truth to light is truth to the medium of photography! All John Cohen’s photographs are made, simply and solely, by the use of light. His magic is the magic of the luminous; his poetry is that of the chiaroscuro. The attractions of his work is all the greater for the purity of the photographic technique, and its appeal all the more universal for being couched in an imagery common to all men and intelligible to all”.

Richie is in court against his ex wife. His attractive female lawyer asks him about being a cop and his connections, pointing out that he knows a lot of "wise guys" particularly Joseph Sodano. Richie says he grew up with them and he's done nothing wrong. His lawyer tells him she needs to understand some things his wife has said. Richie admits that Sodano is his son's godfather. Laurie sees them talking and remarks to her attorney "He's definitely fucking her." Richie's lawyer asks him "Do you really care about this, or do you just not want her to win, ever?" Richie replies by telling her there's a room upstairs that locks from the inside, implying that they should go have sex up there.
Even when my car suddenly stalled at the traffic lights, and hard as I tried, I couldn’t restart it till the lights turned green.

Michael Jackson totally revolutionised ‘pop culture’; he didn’t just re-invent the rule book – he threw it out the window, trashing racial lines in the process and, under the tutelage of Quincy Jones, gave birth to three astonishing albums; each unbound by restrictions of race, ethnicity or genre – Thriller, Off The Wall & Bad.

The thing is, I’ve been working on my manuscript, yes, yes, but I’ve also been working on something else. That something else has made it difficult, actually, to work on my manuscript, because it’s made me want to lie on the couch instead, eating peanut butter sandwiches and fantasizing about donuts. I know it doesn’t look like much, but it’s there, under my shirt. I’ll give you a hint. It’s a baby.

All this and the like more ought to move all the princes, and the whole empire, to forget their own cases and contentions, or let them rest for awhile, and unite, in all earnest, to help the wretched; so that things may not go as they went with Constantinople and Greece. They quarreled with one another and looked after their own affairs, until the Turk overwhelmed both of them together, as he has already come very near doing to us in a similar case. But if this is not to be, and our unrepentant life makes us unworthy of any grace or counsel or support, we must put up with it and suffer under the devil; but that does not excuse those who could help and do not.

People pick it up and like it, but it isn’t quite right for them and their house, and so I have been asked if I can do a larger piece and a piece with neater stripes. So here it is with its new family, which are more uniform. I quite like the larger pieces – they are still not uniform I deliberately cut different thickness stripes with slightly wiggly edges and made the spring green lines not full width to give a sense of containment under the clear glass cap. Lets face it I wouldn’t have played with the design if customers hadn’t asked – and they may not come to the Bath Guildhall on Saturday to see them and buy them, so it is all a bit chaotic really.

And that’s another thing: people who come and get all up in arms and leave comments, not because they’re even remotely interested in my blog, but because they happened to Google “Kelle Hampton” and have deemed themselves Keepers of Kelle Hampton’s Reputation. Which is just weird. Get a life, okay? Despite being accused of “riding on Kelle’s coattails,” I really want people to read my blog because they’re interested in the things I write about – not because I mention a name that they’ve become preoccupied with seeing untarnished.

I didn't even know what title to give this post because basically this is something that I've been putting off and dreading, as well as not even having much time to write. It is also hard to write since my previous post was about how my Mom rocked Thanksgiving. This is because just over a week later, my mother had a massive heart attack and ended up on life support, which was turned off four days later.
To add insult to injury, (and what does that mean in this context?), we went out to dinner again tonight. We ate at the Fairmont Princess La Hacienda. And, just like last night, I ate more than I needed to. More than I should have. Oh, woe is me. The food was very good. We had guacamole, chips, and shrimp ceviche to start. Then I had wonderful crab enchiladas with yummy black beans and rice. And, oh yeah, here comes the dessert! Cinnamon churros with three perfectly scrumptious and fat-laden dipping sauces. The only good thing is that Gary shared the dessert this time. Oh, I forgot to mention the two Margaritas I had--no calories there, right? You know, some people actually don't figure in the calories from alcohol. But they are there, believe me. And they are empty calories.
You were elected the most beautiful woman of the year by a men’s magazine, it flatters you? Not really. You know, lists like this, there are full and, generally, it elects the girl who plays in the biggest blockbuster of the year. The image of rebellious and sexy actress who sticks to your skin, it irritates you? I find it surprising because I hardly ever go out. I glue a picture of bad girl when I do really anything for that. On the contrary: I like reading, hanging out at home. I have the impression of being very boring. You still have girlfriends? I never had many friends. At school, I was not popular. I have always struggled to open up to others, although once I gave my friendship is for life. It’s sad, but now I’m surrounded by people I work with everyday. Hollywood is not the best place to make friends, anyway, I have not succeeded. They say, moreover, that you flee the crowd, and you could not live in a big city … It started after the success of Tra nsfonners. I feel like a zoo animal. As soon as I entered the room, there was always plenty of people who expected something of me, touch me, talk to me, take a picture. I felt no longer have space. It was very scary. So, you never wanted to leave Hollywood? My husband Brian was born and raised here, his whole family is there. It’s a good reason to stay. You said in interview: “The secret power of women is a powerful and confident vagina. Men are afraid of vaginas “… I vividly remember saying that.

Interestingly, the generation from 1906 shown in this graph is much more similar to that woman born in 1966.

Han and Leia explore further how they feel towards each other, perhaps not to the extent as they did in Empire, but here they display a more unconditional love. Maybe it’s all that bonding in battle that did it for them. And in the end, you actually find yourself caring about what happens to these characters - and dare I mention - wanting to invest yourself emotionally in their welfare.
I dont think I can learn this lesson though, when I’m having fun or doing some project I believe in, I forget about everything, so at that moment I dont care if my clothes get ruined, if I loose my bag, anything can happen and I just get carried away with the moment like there’s no tomorrow!!

It’s also fun to come up with names for those trees.

As a result, they have turned to vivid colors, and are extremely dangerous – the jab of a thorn can mean death.

Dayyibu and I put the tire back on Bob’s motorcycle wheel, put the wheel back on, and adjusted his rear brake. I also determined the engine to a water pump here has no compression. It’s kind of at a dead end for now until I can find a compressed air source to do a cylinder leak down test to determine where the leak is coming from. I also started to work on an orange Mitsuba motorcycle that hasn’t run in a while. The spark plug boot, or cap, was missing and the bare, non-insulated spark plug wire was just wrapped around the tip of the spark plug. I went into town with Dayyibu, bought a new spark plug boot, dropped into Salamoun Voyage to eat some more soya (steak). While there, I also had some fried bread known as jinjin. It was kind of sweet and tasted a little like a croissant. I think it had a little bit of sugar sprinkled on it. I also had a fried plantain which was not as appetizing as I thought it would be. I figured I like bananas, especially the delicious bananas here, but not this fried plantain. Oh well.

Today, on this island, a miracle happened: summer came ahead of time. I moved my bed out by the swimming pool, but then, because it was impossible to sleep, I stayed in the water for a long time. The heat was so intense that after I had been out of the pool for only two or three minutes I was already bathed in perspiration again. As day was breaking, I awoke to the sound of a phonograph record. Afraid to go back to the museum to get my things, I ran away down through the ravine. Now I am in the lowlands at the southern part of the island, where the aquatic plants grow, where mosquitoes torment me, where I find myself waist-deep in dirty streams of sea water. And, what is worse, I realize that there was no need to run away at all. Those people did not come here on my account; I believe they did not even see me.

While writing about her visit with her grandparents and thinking about her dreams and such, Dorothy starts to allow snippets of reminiscences: her room at home and the ship's cabin; her frightening dream of melting faces and her visit to Madame Tussaud's wax museum; the freedom and joy of her visit versus the perennial admonitions of Miss Pugh of all things inappropriate, unsuitable, outrageous and vulgar. And we learn that Dorothy had never wanted Miss Pugh to die. In fact, Dorothy blames herself for her chaperone's death.

With all the enthusiasm/uncertainty/outright terror surrounding ebooks and epublishing, there's a huge amount (actually, as far as I'm concerned, way too much) prognosticating about the digital future.

Anyway, back to the skirt. To create the bustle all you will need is 5 inches of coordinating bias tape. I used an extra wide double fold bias tape, because I had it on hand. You will also need about 18 inches of 1/4 inch wide ribbon, a safety pin, and fray check for the ribbon ends.

When did this start? It’s been going on far too long, if you really must know the truth of it. The first time I ever saw him, in “Zoolander,” I was immediately horror-stricken. I knew that the image would stick with me for life, that I would never be the same. At first glance, it was only his unnaturally tall, lean body that I found so inhumanly shocking. Even then, I wondered to myself if he was an alien. As time went on and I encountered him in other places, I started to get other clues suggesting his most likely unearthly origins.
LleMoyne sized him up and said “I can handle him.”
When facing the horrible certainty of death in the darkness of a wintry sea, Humanity, embodied by hundreds of men, women and children aboard the Titanic, rose to her sublimest height. Colonel Archibald Gracie, a Titanic Survivor, wrote: “There were women in the crowd as well as men and these seemed to be steerage passengers who had just come up from the decks below. Even among these people there was no hysterical cry, no evidence of panic. Oh the agony of it.”
The caterpillar and frame are both from the Create a Critter cricut cartridge. The caterpillar is found on page 54 and is cut at 3". I cut the caterpillar with black cardstock, layer 1 using the same green found on my card base and layer 1 is from a Basic Grey scrap that I had lying around that actually matched the pink in the patterned paper.

I’d walk around endlessly in the pouring rain. During this time, I’d wear my favourite clothes and go out. I’d be so soaked and tattered that I’d think “I can’t be like this” and toughen up.
As I kept my attention on the swooping birds I was caught with the sensation of air flowing over my skin and of feeling as light as a feather. Flight was the first word that came into my mind. And while I was sitting on a tree over a creek I saw nothing of the tree but for a few of the branches that leaned over the flowing water. My mind carried the image of looking down directly over the creek and the tree. Then with one last swoop and a climb before my mind’s eye returned me to where I physically was; I was again sitting on a tree looking over to the other side of the creek.

Most the ships in my hangar are Industrial ships overall, pretty much aligns with my usual activity. Most the ships I fly daily happen to be a Frigate’s. My Buzzard see more fly time by far than any other ships I own probably a good 80% the time. Next up is the Crane I fly probably the other 15% the time. And less than 5% the time I would guess I fly any other ship in my hangar. For all those ships only 2 of them really see fly the hostile skies. That’s about all I ever usually need to run my business across 7 major regions of empire space. The Skiff’s there in hangar I recently Invented and produced and those 2 were sold earlier today.

I also have a dilemma. My dad has never pressured me to do what he does or even asked for help, he tells me to do what I want to do but what I want is to make sure that he’s ok. That what he does is successful. I also know that he wants me to pursue whatever it is that I want to do. I can’t seem to make a decision… To everyone else, it’s simple. Do what YOU want to do. What if what I want is more than one thing? I want to create my own path, mainly to prove to myself that I can but is that more important than making sure that the legacy that my father has created survives? The american life is all about doing what you want to do, individuality, being your own person but that culture isn’t always the best. Community is pretty important… taking on the burdens of those that I love even at the cost of my own dreams, seeing to it that their dreams are also achieved. I guess that would leave me with the short end of things. Life is short… can what I pursue really make a difference compared to helping someone achieve theirs? “It takes a village to raise a child” is what comes to mind for this idea. Please don’t mistake this as me being such a selfless person, I’m just trying to figure things out. But I do enjoy seeing other succeed… have I not had any great enough accomplishments to really enjoy myself succeeding? Where are my selfish ambitions that drive me to become the best? to be not just a survivor but to thrive in this competitive world? am I meant to be poor? because I do so well when I have little… I guarantee it that I will out-survive anyone if we were put in a 3rd world country with limited resources. I just do well… is this a sign? I only do hw when it’s procrastinated… when I feel pressure, I perform… I know this is somehow contradicting the beginning of my post but guess what?! My life is full of them!!! CONTRADICTIONS! just like the commercials for the candy! the irish korean!

Then I yelled at him. I'm not proud. Not. At. All. Actually, my heart hurts right now as I type this because, all though his reaction was extreme, it's not at all uncommon. Especially for right before bed time. And it's not entirely his fault I have been extremely worn out the last week and a half! And just flat out not a nice word! To anyone!
In 1920 he put together his own band, with whom he recorded in 1925. That same year he also scored a gig on radio broadcasting with Art Hickman's orchestra; this ensemble toured the U.S., then did an extended residency in Florida. After some time in New York City, Fox and Arnheim reconvened in Hollywood, working at the Ambassador Hotel, and Fox continued to broadcast with his own bands. During this time he also did a number of film soundtracks. In 1930 Fox was invited to perform in London, which he first did on September 29, 1930. He recorded on the BBC that year, and when his band returned to the U.S. the following spring, Fox remained behind, recording with a new group for Decca Records and accepting an engagement at the Monseigneur restaurant in Piccadilly. He lost this contract in November 1931 when he fell ill with pleurisy and traveled to Switzerland for a stay at a sanatorium. Upon his return he put together yet another group composed entirely of new members aside from trumpeter/vocalist Sid Buckman, and performed in Belgium as well as the UK. Art Christmas played a variety of instruments in this band. He made the films On the Air and Big Ben Calling in 1933-34, recorded for HMV in 1936, and toured Europe until 1938, when he fell ill again."

Additionally, much of Jude/2Peter 2 is an allusion to Jewish writings just before the first century known as the “Pseudepigrapha.” These are Jewish writings (in Greek) that give a lot of “back-story” to many of the OT writings and give a window into Jewish belief and mysticism for some sects of the Jewish faith around the time of Christ.
The dogs are good all-beef versions. You can multiply your options by trying a brat, Polish, andouille or Italian sausage with any combo you desire. Best of all the meat eaters can take a Veggie Eater along. Cori’s offers a veggie dog, vegan polish and vegan Italian. When combined with the veggie options for toppings, it leaves the Veggie Eater with an absurd number of combinations. That’s a nice development on a Friday night after a couple of beers.
This week's Penny Black Reader Challenge is "Wet Embossing." This is the first time I have come across the term but I believe it is exactly the same as Heat Embossing. My colour inspiration was taken from the April Penny Black @ Allsorts Challenge of "Black & White plus One."

The first is exactly the opposite of the senility theory: the repetitions aren’t signs of senility and age, but of perpetual youth and vitality. We wouldn’t be surprised to see this in a man so delighted with the prospect of eternal life. G. K. Chesterton once wrote that children, precisely because of their vitality, always say “’do it again’; and the grown-up person does it again until he is nearly dead.”[4] John loves repetition the way children love repetition. If we don’t feel like keeping up with him, it is because he is younger than we.

Sassy is in good pasture condition - she's not fit, but she lives in a large pasture with other horses that keep her very active, so I'd say she's ready to trail ride, but would need further conditioning for other disciplines. You can see from the photo that she's got good weight on her.

Sương Sáo aka Grass Jelly is a dessert/drink popular throughout Southeast Asia. According to Chinese medicine it has "cooling" properties and is good for the skin. Grass Jelly is actually made from a dried herb that is a member of the mint family...not grass as the name suggests. The herb's name in Chinese which is "len fan chou" (cooling grass). Thus, jelly made from cooling grass is....you guessed it Grass Jelly.

Thankfully for us, our apartment had never been subjected to any eccentric additions, and I doubt we would have bought it if it had as we wanted to avoid precisely the problems we've ended up with.

Aaron from The Captain’s Chair blog proved to be a perfect gentleman whose mama done raised him right when he sent me replacement bottles of NEW GLARUS beers that broke in transit during our recent beer trade. Not only that, he threw in a bonus beer for my troubles. Now that’s a Great American. The bonus was this NEW GLARUS “CHERRY STOUT” – part of their “Unplugged” series where the brewer just goes off the hizzle and does whatever it is he wants, ye publick be damned. I love that sort of thing, and it’s why I was pretty excited to give this one a go.
You can certainly use all beef or venison. I mix it really well with my hands. Fill the jerky gun, and use the "ribbon" fitting. Fill the dehydrator trays. (Three lbs. of ground meat fills the four trays of my dehydrator.)
From what has been said of the testimonies from these abused women and their peaceful attitudes towards their abusive situations, they know the door is opened to them and that the door only passes through Christ. We must pray for the husbands to be converted. They are choosing the creature over the creator! This is idolatry which scripture warns about from the beginning. To worship even your spouse more than God is idolatry. We must only love others in a right-ordered manner beginning with God first, because He is love, and resounding through our spouse and everyone else we come in contact with daily, even our enemies, or even those that abuse us. As for the law enforcement officials that continue to do nothing about this situation, their sin is greater because they can put a stop to this evil by upholding the law! God is a God of justice and it will be served. The greater good seems to be the example of courage and perseverance of these Christian women, which has the same rippling effect as the evil does, but in a positive way. They are truly living testaments to you and others of Christ by “loving their enemies” and “taking up their crosses daily” and following Jesus. He will never give us more then we can handle and as for all the evil in the world, Jesus has already conquered it by the cross of love!"

The adventure of the Schalcken Replica had little to do with these things; it was concerned with his pictures. Pictures were his hobby. His little house in Ellesmere Terrace, within sight of the great chimneys in Atterwell Lane, was crowded with them, turned with their faces to the wall, though they had nothing of which to be ashamed. He always intended hanging them some day, just as he intended to move into a larger and more convenient house; but, being a radical, the roots of his nature clung close to old habits and old surroundings. He was born and he would die in Ellesmere Terrace, a semi-detached bachelor.
I am awed by the synchronicity. I suddenly remember the night many years ago, when Gem scooped our three year old son, Nicholas, from his bed and carried him wrapped in a blanket, outside. There we stood in an inky darkness punctuated by countless twinkling stars. Nicholas, awakened to a new sense of dreaming, stretched an arm out towards the sky. That was only the first of many star-watching sprees shared between father and son. Now, holding in my hands tangible proof that this unalterable language is being bequeathed from my son to his daughter, I am filled with immeasurable tenderness.

A chapter later in 1 Kings, we learn more: "And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding beyond measure, and largeness of mind like the sand on the seashore, so that Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt. For he was wiser than all other men, . . . And men came from all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and from all the kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom." (1 Kings 4:29-31,34)

Moussake is something that I've wanted to create in pie form for a while, and despite the appearance issue, I felt it was time to give it a go. I figured that if I added cornflour to the filling then this would make it less watery - therefore less inclined to simply ooze out when slicing into the pie.

We’ve done that before. Alcohol use to be illegal. There are tons on drugs that were illegal last year and will be legal today. Where do you draw the line? Do you water down the illegal drug and make them “safer”? Drug dealers will simply sell a more “potent” strand of the same drug or create a new one to continue the illegal activity. To that end, some of the most fierce addictions these days are to legal drugs like oxycodone and vicodin.

This is the last session that I went to on Thursday morning before I gave up and went out to enjoy myself on my last day in Las Vegas. Just in case you are not familiar with the acronym S.T.E.M., this stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math, and it refers to projects that integrate all four of these subject areas into one unit of study. The presenter was Sandi Reyes, who is the head of her New York district’s S.T.E.M. department and does a lot of staff development for them in this area. The best part of the session, I thought, was that Sandi pointed out that S.T.E.M. is what you probably are already doing, because Kindergarten teachers tend to do integrated units anyway. All you have to do is pull it all together and make sure that you include all four elements with the science, technology, engineering, and math. (Remember, for the engineering part, all they really need to do is build something such as a simple machine, so it’s really not as intimidating as it sounds.) And, any time you do an engineering project, the scientific process comes into play because you must experiment with the thing you are building and then test it out.

The Treasury are blaming the euro zone crisis and Labour is blaming the Government’s policies. In 2008 the Conservatives were happy to blame the Labour Government for the financial crisis, even though they said it was a worldwide problem. Now it seems the situation has been reversed. So who is right?

4. Prepare your car for a quick getaway. If you realize that you can’t live without that new pair of shoes and you didn’t follow rule 2, you can always make a quick trip to the suburbs and suburban shopping malls. Just be prepared to stay out there once you realize that traffic coming back into the city is a nightmare. But it’s ok, just call it a staycation. Or suburbcation if you will. Enjoy the empty streets, the wide parking spaces, the trees (and the extra oxygen these trees provide), and Olive Garden. A trip to the suburbs is never complete without a stop at Olive Garden.
These are the best momnents, if I'm honest - it shows that your work is really getting out to a global audience.

Being connected to Jesus – together – is the only way to do this! And our job is to get people moving in the right direction towards that centre! And it’s not necessarily organised! A vine is not very systematic or tidy. But the branches are plugged into the vine! The branches are centred in Jesus! And outside of that it’s pretty dead!

2. Don’t buy for investment purposes, but rather because you love it. First of all, art can fluctuate in value, just like the stock market. So when it comes to purchasing, not be swayed by the salesperson. Regardless of whether it is an unknown, an up and coming, or a well know artist… buy it because you like it! It is that simple. Don’t concern yourself with whether or not it goes with the style of your interiors, because if you already like your interiors, the chances are they are going to work just fine together.
In the mean time, here's what happened: We came to know the kids from some of the families of our parish with whom we don't get to spend a lot of time, because they're not homeschooling the kids who are my older kids' ages, and they don't have little ones crying through Mass in the narthex (like Cuppie does). We also met and came to know some other amazing kids from families in other parishes--families we'd heard about, but we'd never had the blessing of meeting. Most of the kids were familiar to the Frog because of a diocesan-wide retreat she attended in February. Some of them were in her confirmation class.

“At the end of the Don Juan story, as I remember it, he is having dinner with Doña Aminta who is a depressed, boring, unhappy woman. But he has also invited the Stone Guest to dinner – the ghost of Don Gonzalo, whom he killed. While Doña Aminta is praying, the hellish Stone Guest invites Don Juan to follow him to Hell. He is not dragged or kidnapped…he has a free choice between life with a depressive, unhappy woman and the road to Hell. And Don Juan chooses to go to Hell. That’s my choice too. I want to be engulfed in the flames.

Vedic astrology can be very helpful in showing the nature of our experiences. There are certain planetary influences and planetary periods that can promote inner experiences. Influences involving Rahu, the north node of the Moon, for example, are more likely to be illusory. Those involving the lords of the fifth and ninth house, particularly when Jupiter, are likely to be more wholesome. There is an entire set of Vedic astrological rules that can be helpful in understanding our spiritual experiences and where these are likely to take us. Vedic astrology can also recommend mantras, gems and rituals that can help make our spiritual experiences more wholesome, or even give us spiritual experiences of an astrological nature. A good Vedic astrologer can help you with these.

The premise upon which the left and Occupy sympathizers base their argument upon is very misleading.

After the woman has been shot by the antagonist, the camera changes to a slick, good looking man walking out of the shadows, like a hero would in a superhero film. The music also changes to a jazz upbeat sound, which tells us that this man is the protagonist, as it is a totally opposite sound to that of the antagonist.
That’s the place where they all got sick and the doctor had to come and give everyone but her father a shot of penicillin every day for a week. Cassie, who was four at the time, and her big sister, Sue, six-years old,were with Mom in the big bed. Their little brother, Billy, was in his crib pushed up against the wall. All of them were sweaty and coughing. No one was getting any sleep and Daddy had to bring them soup and pass out pills and change Billy’s diapers. Every day the doctor would ask Cassie and Sue who they wanted to get a shot first. Neither little girl would answer. Cassie always wanted to tell him to give the shot to their mother first. She was the only one who didn’t cry and maybe, just once, he’d get confused and forget about her. But she never got up the nerve to say anything. Some days she was first, some days Sue or Mom. Billy was always last everyone always got the shot

The difference is that currently it is a completely different ball-game altogether. The SA Right-Wing easily talks of war, but they have not even studied their opponent, they do not understand their opponent and they think they are going to a gunfight governed by set rules that both parties would abide by, but they are being ignorant and foolish, because they have no idea what they would be up against.
We all know these fights against inevitable sleep, those resolves to reach the inaccessible end of the chapter, those swimmings in the head, those relapses into the gulf of oblivion. And we all know those long readings when the mystery and suspense of the text so excite us that every creak of the stair and every fluttering of the pertinacious moths makes the heart stand still, and then keeps it beating hard for minutes. We have all turned the light out just in time; and we have all turned it out from boredom, or in an access of determined common-sense, and then turn it on again to resume dreary reading where we left the piece of paper or the pencil in the page. But we seldom talk about it. It is part of our really private lives.”

It's not super expensive here in Brazil (when I got to know how much an average American girl pays just to have her nails done, my heart missed a beat!)

I bought a small kit and started doing my nails.
You guys probably know all about Pinterest but if not, here’s the skinny in simplified form. It’s as the name suggests – a place to ‘pin’ things of interest to you on a ‘board.’ Others can follow the things you pin to your virtual board and share those items with their followers. In this way, it’s another available marketing tool for those of you with books to sell. Ok, so maybe none of this makes sense. Take a look at my link below to see an example of what Pinterest is about.

We must have complete abandonment, even if things may seem impossible. The Bibles teaches us to be this way. We aren’t fully committed Christians if we don’t fully give our hearts and soul to Him. It doesn’t matter what it is, do everything to your best ability. Don’t slack. Don’t give in. Give your all. God will give you strength to continue if it may seem impossible.

Nephi was a prophet. Nephi and his brothers were mean to Nephi. Nephi was good. His brothers tied Nephi to the boat. Nephi said if he could come off. A storm happened and the brothers let go. I love that he can come up with something like this when he wants to. Sometimes doing his kindergarten homework can be like walking through molasses together, but when he gets an idea of his own that he really cares about, he works hard on it.
I've had a lot of shitty things happen abroad, thing I don't like to talk about. Mostly, they were my own fault. It took me forever to share them with Bria, so I'd rather not repeat them now. But the worst thing of all… well, I think it was the point when I thought I'd never see Bria again.

The image is from the Hunkdory freebie and is a simple decoupage image which I edged with peel offs. The sentiment is also edged with peel offs and I have added some buttons because they were on my desk and seemed to fit.
Leonard enjoyed chasing women and racing yachts, but his wife longed for Europe, and in the late 1860s she moved to Paris with her three daughters, which proved a fateful move.
This, however, is not the end. After getting married, there’s the whole…you know…marriage…thing. You have to be married for the rest of your life until death do you part and blah blah blah. (You can probably tell how I view marriage without me even saying anything.) Now I’m not against the idea of relationships, but I am against what happens to the people in them. Once a couple gets married, they somehow forget everything they’ve been doing to prettify (yes that’s actually a word) themselves. They stop working out, get pissed off at each other, start drinking, and get a beer gut. Next thing you know, there’s no chance that our happily married example couple could run from the zombies. They just stop caring.

This may be a universal truth -- to strive for good. Christians follow the commandments and turn the other cheek, even to the point of sacrificing what they love most. If they sin, they are forgiven if they but believe. Who can forget "Do unto others as you would have done to you"? Before the Christians were the Jews: "What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor."

IF I WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT, I would absolutely have NO speeches with a crowd of carefully staged faces behind me. I detest such staging. It annoys me and insults me. I know why those people are there and that they were picked. Others can engage in such balderdash, but not me. If I gave a speech as President, it would just be me speaking to my audience. No distractions. No gimmicks. Just my words.

He breathed on the black glass, and her image swirled to life. Raven haired and beautiful, she looked at least twenty years younger than when she had died.
Is it because sellers think their home is worth more than the market will bear? Maybe…especially when a home is first listed and an offer is quickly received that is much below asking price. Often times a Seller will list their home higher than “market value” to allow for wiggle room in negotiations. Any ready, willing & able buyer that has been looking for a while will jump on the chance to write an offer on a new listing especially if it is in good condition and meets their criteria. The reality is that this buyer is educated, is ready to buy and knows what a home’s value is. Unfortunately, this value may not be acceptable to a Seller and if received shortly after a home has been listed, a Seller may say…”it is the first offer, we’ve only been on the market for a short period, we’ll wait for something better to come along”. Nine times out of ten, the first offer is the best so I encourage Sellers to seriously consider any offers received, not to discard them and to negotiate reasonably. Even better yet, have a list price that is appropriate for your market and reflects your home’s value. I guarantee that you will receive an offer closer to your asking price. Buyers are waiting for the next best listing and if they see the value in it, they will offer a price that is reflective of this.
Tonight my lovely boyfriend and I are headed to the movies. It's his turn to choose which means we're seeing a sci-fi flick. Again... Just kidding though. I don't mind. As long as it's not horror, I'm good. And with the weekend temps predicted to be in the low 50's, looks like I won't be going into hibernation mode just yet. Truth be told though, I'm hoping for a warm winter to make up for all the crappy weather we had last year.
On the second day, Deidre and I went on a two-hour camel ride along the beach to the next village over called Diabat, which is where Jimi Hendrix used to have a house. There is also an old crumbled castle there now covered in sand, which supposedly inspired Hendrix’s song “Castles Made of Sand,” although that can be up for debate. It was exciting to see my first camels in Morocco and it was very fun riding one although rather bumpy, especially when the camel stands up and lies down.
Plenty of Tyrion, now feeling more secure on the one hand, promoting Bronn to the head of the city watch, and a little less so when Varys was pointing out how he knew of Tyrion’s woman. I did like how he questioned the baby slaughter, and found out it wasn’t Cersei who ordered it.
It hit me last night. My novel has decided to become a series. I never would have expected myself capable of writing a series. I have an idea, and I follow it through to the end. But here I have four individual stories waiting to be told, all tied together with an overarching main concept. WTF (let's choose "fudge" this time; I'd never say that other word)? How did that happen?
1. Must be chic
I've begun to think that habitat might provide the answer.
"How typical he would expect Wilbur to act just as badly."
What happened is this: A pregnant woman and her husband were reassured several times during her pregnancy that the baby was healthy. The baby, a girl, was diagnosed with Down's Syndrome shortly after her birth. Her parents initiated a lawsuit, claiming wrongful life. They asserted that they would have aborted her, given the correct information, and they were denied that opportunity through negligence of the physicians. They requested monetary damages to help cover the cost of her care over her lifetime.
You can still grab some great pieces from the collection on sale online. You don't often hear of Warehouse doing designer collaborations such as these and I thought this one was a lot better than some of the things I've seen in Topshop's designer collaborations. I hope the collaborations continue and that Miss Craver will go on to do even greater things.
I have to say for me it is the beauty I see!
A number of years ago, we "invented" a game in which we ball up our socks and throw them at each other as a kind of indoor snowball fight. Over the years, the snowballs have become larger and larger, and have been thrown harder and harder, often toward sensitive places. When we first began playing, our room was like a typical bedroom from any other home: pictures on the walls, glass vases, nice drapes, etc. We also used to play a game called "family ball" in which we would take a very soft plush ball and play indoor soccer or handball. Even when the boys were young, these games would get pretty fast and energetic, with the ball flying every which way. And again, our living room was a typical: pictures on the walls, vases, a TV, a Wii, computers - you name it, we had it.
I embossed the white panel with Forest Branches embossing folder. I adhered the tree to the panel by applying glue just to the trunk up to the top to leave the branches loose on the card. (and miracle of miracles - I didn't smudge the Stickles with my fingers while taking the picture of this card!)
Plus I have some other projects in mind that I am feeling comfortable enough to try. I know, I should be doing stuff that is uncomfortable. I will very soon, promise. I really need to find some Lego ninja minifigs!

It took a day or two and some urgent clarification before the pickets dispersed and the Cuban delegation found its way back to the docks, but Kay had firmly struck me off the list of Insulted and Injured.
I responded "Lose my number, bitch", and ran upstairs to look for Jered. I found him on the couch he passed out on and smacked him in the head to wake him up. I said, "I don't know what the fuck you told your whore girlfriend but obviously she's a psycho. Tell her to NEVER call or text me again". He looked thoroughly confused, and said he'd take care of it, and as we were talking another text came through from her - "Then stop talking about." I told him he could add on to the message to never call me again that she should probably learn grammar and the English language as well.

Anyway, when I was in my late 20’s and early 30’s, I was having some problems and suffered a number of miscarriages. My Ob/Gyn at the time said, as every doctor I’d ever seen had said, “I wish we had some medical history on you.” Me, too. Around this time, it seemed like every week scientists were discovering another serious medical condition, disease or cancer that was genetic. If only you knew what scary stuff was in your genes, you could protect yourself, get screened early, take preventative measures. It didn’t seem fair that I couldn’t have that.

Sheri's Bio by Sheri:
National Train Day marks the 143rd anniversary of the creation of the nation's first transcontinental railroad. On May 10, 1869, in Promontory Summit, Utah, the 'golden spike' was driven into the final tie that joined 1,776 miles of the Central Pacific and Union Pacific railways, forever transforming the face and character of America.

Elizabeth: I write under my own name, Elizabeth Vallone, though my first work of historical fiction was under E.P. Vallone. Beyond Bagheria was a work of historical fiction set in New Orleans in 1920. In addition, I’ve been a contributing editor on a couple of anthologies. One was Imprints on Rockland County History – the Biographies of 12 Women and Curaggia—the Writings of Italian American Women.
It's not really solitude though. I prefer to pick busy hotels rather than quiet country spots, because I like to hear city life going on around me while I work, the patter of toddlers' feet down the corridors, families moving in and out of rooms, the hum of traffic outside.
Over the last number of weeks I have been thinking and praying not only about certain political issues, but the role of Christians, pastors, and churches in the political landscape. What is the appropriate level of political action or activism for individual Christians and churches?

The doors had broken this happens sometimes. However the sign indicated the right people are aware of the issue and are in debates of how to solve the problem. You didn’t need more information than that. Unfortunately for my over thinking brain I noticed that also there was some yellow ‘do not cross’ tape stretched across the faulty doors.
Anyway, I really don't have a lot to share, but I have been creating. Here are two that I can. They are both for the monthly challenges at Memorable Seasons. This first one was created for Tami's color challenge (although I did tweak it and added some blue which was not in the color scheme):

Indeed, Barack Obama is liked, according to polling. When push comes to shove, though, when it’s about voters’ jobs, homes, and financial security, likability takes a distant second place. Likeable employees are fired every day for nonperformance; they may get better severances, but off they go. Voters have historically proven to be tough employers.
The idea behind co-operation is simple - people working co-operatively together can achieve far more than people working on their own. In short, teamwork always wins.

Yes, be real. Be honest. First with yourself, and then with someone else. And then together, walk boldly into the abandoned building and watch redemption take place. Watch God restore it and remodel it into something more beautiful than it was in the first place. His project may take years. But check in with me during the restoration process. You're not alone. And I'd love to hear how you're doing... even on the ugliest of days.

And there seem to be a lot of different variations - extreme minimalists - they only own 25 things or they live in hotels and all their stuff fits into one suitcase, or they have a house with just a mattress on the floor and not even a table, or a tiny house under 900 square foot; or they have got rid of their car and cycle everywhere; or more moderate practitioners where you are allowed only 30 of each thing - one lady recommended only having 30 coats !! Or minimalism linked to Christianity, or frugalism, or environmentalism - using less to leave a smaller footrprint on the world... just fascinating, a total reaction to excessive consumption - it's no surprise that lot of these bloggers are American.

Originally 'forgetting the time' was a writing blog, a space for my writing, others writing, books, readings and other literature events, and to explore my inspiration. As time has gone on, I've written blog posts that have covered all different areas of my life from depression to redundancy to films and plays to friendships. Sometimes, I've written blog posts that on reflection seem far too raw and personal. But, then some friends have commented that these are the ones they like the best.

“There are a couple of factors in the ordinance,” Oxten said. “You don’t have to be home to necessarily be in violation of the ordinance. However, I don’t think we’ve had any cases of that yet. What that’s intended for, is if there is a person that’s advertising a party and that person is not there, they can still get the ticket. The issue is if they were aware of the party, engaging in it, and encouraging people to drink.”

I don’t mind helping my friends and being there for when they are blue, but when you’re friends are in a constant state of sadness, it becomes hard to cope with the negativity. I will always be there for my friends as long as they need me, but sometimes I won’t because I am not superwoman. I don’t really know what a normal friendship is like, but I do know that sitting in an unhealthy one won’t do me any good. So from now on I will try and be less emotional, not like a robot although sometimes I do feel like one! But more optimistic about the rest of my treasures and beautiful friends who get neglected but who mean the world to me. Those are the true friends who I love and just enjoy spending time with, without thinking of it as a chore!

CF: If I had to pick one thing out from the series as a whole it would probably be the plot arc that I managed to weave into the whole 13 episodes. It was subtle, yet it worked, and completely took people by surprise. I had people sure that Davros was coming back... so when Rassilon walked up to the TARDIS doors I would like to think that it took a lot of people by surprise! I must say some of it happened as spur-of-the-moment writing. I knew where I wanted to get to but the way that I did it was changed with pretty much every episode I wrote. In the end it all worked out fine.
Then warn that Republicans would double the interest rate on student loans. Well, first, Mitt Romney has said he would keep them right where they are. Second, as The Post points out, this is nothing but a recycled campaign gimmick from 2006, when Democrats advocated (and later passed) a 50 percent rate cut that gratuitously squanders student aid by subsidizing the wealthy as well as the needy.

Overall, I am glad the highlighter did not disappoint both in design, pigmentation, and formula. The collection has a lot of beautiful classic everyday pieces that you can reach for over and over again. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the face products either. I was a bit disappointed that NM did not have the loose powder tester. I imagine that would be a nice staple as well.

There are basically three types of foot; some call it foot pronation types. These are the underpronated foot, overpronated foot, and the neutral pronated foot. Underpronated foot usually has high foot arches. When an underpronator runs, their foot rolls outward. On the other hand, overpronated foot has low foot arches and when an overpronator runs, their foot rolls inward. Neutral pronator has a normal foot arch which makes them lucky because they can choose from wide selection of running shoes.
My diet is not doing so well. I have been doing all the wrong things again. But not discouraged today I am getting back on track.

It also takes self-control to get rid of lustful thoughts. Lust is just as much of a sin as the act. In fact, lust brings the desire to commit an act of sexual immorality. Once again I encourage you to seek help from someone if you are having trouble practicing self-control in any situation. That’s part of what being “brothers in Christ” is. We help and serve each other. Don’t be controlled by sexual desires because it leads to death, just like any other sin. Sin waiting for the moment to pounce and gain control of your life, but you must conquer it! (Genesis 4:7) You conquer sin through the blood of Jesus Christ!

Rothbard is right: It *IS* absurd to imagine completely separate cycles existing with absolutely no influence on each other. On the other hand, it is not absurd to imagine that more than one cycle might arise from economic forces generated by concurrent economic activity of billions of people spread over the face of a planet. Nor is it absurd to imagine such cycles themselves in continuous interaction.

The capitalists who own the means of energy production (such as offshore oil rigs, refineries, coal mines, and the like) are incapable of defending the environment and protecting humanity from the effects of environmental damage or climate change. This is because of capitalism's commitment to production for the sake of profit. In the market, need is measured not in terms of hunger, sickness or pollution, but in terms of profit. The capitalists of BP and other the oil companies have no reason whatsoever to avoid the pollution of the environment if this impedes the production of their profit. It is the job of Obama and the politicians of the twin ruling class parties, the Democrats and Republicans, to protect the interests of the oil companies and make sure that nothing does indeed impede their production of profits.

Her mother is the most disgusting crude woman I’ve ever seen on on TV with the exception of anything to step foot on Jerry Springer. She seriously belched on TV. *Shudder* Her mother, June?, gives Honey Boo Boo Child what they refer to as “Go-Go Juice” to get her ready for pageants. What is this concoction? “Go-Go Juice” is a mixture of Red Bull and Mountain Dew. Seriously, she’s giving her 6 year old child Red Bull and Mountain Dew mixed. She’s 100% adamant that this is OK to give a 6 year old because it makes her come alive on stage. Whatever. She just… Ugh. You walk into their house and because she’s an extreme couponer she has 6000 rolls of toilet paper, 16 million deoderants, 50 things of dish soap…It’s ridiculous. That’s actually how the get money for pageants- couponing. The money that would go to food now goes to Honey Boo Boo Child. When they cut to Alanas room the walls were completely bare except for three of her pageant pictures hanging up on the wall, unframed, using push pins to secure it into the wall. I can go on and on. Her mom looks like Jabba the hut and should not be giving her child Red Bull and Mountain Dew mixed together. I’m 24 years old and my heart cannot handle that. Literally I feel like I’m having a heart attack. I cannot imagine being 6 and having that amount of caffeine .

Such critics question whether science could ever be a genuine vehicle for discovering the deepest truths, because they feel that science is rooted in a desire to know for the wrong reasons. Obviously, in your work you have been very immersed in the scientific world—you know a lot of scientists, you go to conferences, you’re surrounded by all of that and also, perhaps, you struggle with that motivation in yourself. Could you speak a little more about your experience of that?

Lucy Bloom is broke, freshly dumped by her boyfriend, and forced to sell her house to send her nineteen-year-old son to drug rehab. Although she’s lost it all, she’s determined to start over. So when she’s offered a high-paying gig helping clear the clutter from the home of reclusive and eccentric painter Marva Meier Rios, Lucy grabs it. Armed with the organizing expertise she gained while writing her book, Things Are Not People, and fueled by a burning desire to get her life back on track, Lucy rolls up her sleeves to take on the mess that fills every room of Marva’s huge home. Lucy soon learns that the real challenge may be taking on Marva, who seems to love the objects in her home too much to let go of any of them.
Slim-fitting, bright pants have been on my shopping list for a couple of months now, so a couple weekends ago I set out to find a pair. The effort proved slightly more difficult than I had imagined. I had seen this very pair on the Michael Kors website, but when I popped into the store in the Westfield Mall, I saw that they didn't have any pants on their racks. I then headed to Bloomingdale's, where I proceeded to try on bright teal, coral, fuchsia, yellow, you name it... but they all looked monstrous. What I realized is that the colors I was trying all struck me as being great for a woman in her 20's, but on me they just looked awkward, and not really me. What I needed was what I'd been originally drawn to on the website. What I needed was an intense red, which was the one color I couldn't find on the entire vast, bright-pants-laden floor.

This should be very freeing. We are to love. We don't have to be theologians to love. We just need to love. We don't have to understand the political climate to love. We just need to be loving to all people. We don't need to have a perfect ecclesiology or eschatology to love. We just need to care for the needs of the people around us and focus on the goodness of God.

I can recall at just about every position an instance where responses were crafted to mislead employees on some upcoming event – an office move, loss of a contract that resulted in layoffs, company being acquired, or a shift in corporate policy which affected employees. Of course, the justification was to prevent employees from being confused or misinterpreting events. Think about it, is there any more pompous condescending attitude?? In essence, it is the impression of senior management that the majority of employees are incapable of analytical thought and/or are too stupid to understand corporate strategy.

so my big decision is to mostly remove carboydrate from my diet. i’ve been working on it since tuesday. i’m well under the recommended 100g a day by taking out bread, pasta, rice and sugar. of course, i pretty much want to kill someone for a timtam right now. and i dont intend to never eat those things again (sugar in particular. in fact, if i get through a month sticking to my plan for 6 days a week im going to make a pavlova). but i cant tell you how great i feel already. just a little thing like changing my breakfast from grains to protein has changed the whole shape of my day. im not hungry. not at all. this means im not thinking about food. this is a huge step forward for me, being one of those people who has an emotional relationship with food. i feel alert and energetic, am sleeping really well and feel like this is something i can sustain. i always was a meat lover, so this plan works to my natural strengths! dont worry, im not going to blog about it endlessly, because there really is nothing more painful than diet blogging (get a life people). but i think its important to acknowledge the change and to let you know if it works!
VIVIENNE: Being the hopeless romantic that I am, I loved the romance scenes.

My husband, who has recently become a rum aficionado since spending time in the Caribbean, plans to distill booze. He thinks this will give him a lot of influence and bargaining power for other commodities. We have discussed the need for weapons (crossbows look good, based on The Walking Dead) to defend the booze and ourselves.

The trade-off, of course, was suffering through the pre-show "entertainment," a reggae-oid band and a standard-issue rock band which sounded like a fourth-generation xerox of U2. Although, I have to admit, finding rock bands in Europe with the credentials to get the kind of security clearance you'd have to have to play a gig like this couldn't have been easy. Asking them to be good would be too much, and not having them would have meant more of the DJ, who got extra points for tone-deafness for sticking on some remix of "Sympathy for the Devil" shortly before Obama hit the stage. (Actual last song before he spoke, though, was Bowie doing "Let's Dance," and I think I can now live without hearing that one ever again. Talk about dated...)
In African countries people recognize and respect differences in power. According to Geert Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions analysis the PDI (Power Distance Index) indicates that the extent to which the less powerful members of organizations and institutions (like the family) accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. The representation here is based on inequality (more versus less), but on the other hand defined from below, and not from above.

I’ve already let slip this new book’s working title, which is The Frozen King, so I can safely blab that out again. I’m happy to tell you it’s a short novel (first draft just under 62,000 words) and that the story is essentially a murder mystery – not something I’ve written before. One of the great pleasures of getting it to this stage has been slowly crawling my way up the whodunnit learning curve, which proved to be rather steeper than I’d anticipated.
Wow, He knew I needed this verse. As He helped me work through focusing on Him with an undivided heart last year, He now has my full attention. But with that, He's begun the process of altering my confidence in Him--the kind that will produce a deeper, Spirit-filled love and discipline in me.

I find it amusing and challenging to deal with these discussions. But something that always challenged me, at least till I moved to Israel, was the discussions that involved the authors surroundings. For a person living in Denmark, far to the north (at least compared to the ME), it doesn’t make much sense when the Sages talked about the “round of the rising sun” or when the moon is opposite to the sun, in order to establish times for when the night ends and the day begins, or the other way around. But that is what was relevant for them, something I only realized and really notices after I moved here. From where I live I can look east towards Jordan, so when the sun rise in the morning, I can literally see a ball of light on the sky growing and become more light, until the sun rises over the horizon, and at that special time of month, where the moon and the sun will stand opposite of each other, just before the sun sets and the moon begins to rise, I can actually see what the Rabbis saw, and get that better understanding of what they talked about. For me moving here, means that what was theoretic knowledge became real knowledge, what was another person’s experience suddenly became my own.

At first she became really still, almost like she was dead. Then she gasped a large amount of air and passed over. We all stood motionless, I guess it was the shock of her going so quick. It wasn’t until Kevin had mentioned about shutting her eyes, when we all moved again. As Karina reached down to close over her eye lids, they began to change colour. In the space of 1minute, Abaguette’s eyes went from hazel brown to a cloudy blue and then to the foggy white of those of the un-dead. We waited for a moment with our weapons gripped tight in our hands.

“Seriously?! It’s not the remit of the police either and it’s like us telling police officers they can arrest people but then not training them in how to deliver upon that in reality. In any event, I’ve rung back to argue against this idea that the police are legally obliged. Nothing in this incident currently is making it a priority over the volume of other calls currently being received. The only free officers in the area are literally running from 999 call to 999 call. The reality is, you can’t get the police for a few hours yet. If that changes, they’ll let you know. But it’s quite wrong to push against that decision by arguing they are obligated, because they are not. As and when officers become free from other, higher priority calls, they will consider a request to support.”

In this lies the strength of democratic rule that everyone is equal before the democratically enacted law.

Everything changed. God somehow opened my eyes and brought me to a place of peace, but it wasn't something that happened overnight. In the midst of the bundle of emotions I felt ashamed for how quickly I snatched up the gift of birthing my own biological child, afraid that I accepted it with less than the immense gratitude that it deserved. Terrified that I wouldn't get to experience it a second time, because after all, my plans included at least three more children, and it was imperative that my dreams come true, in my way, and in my time.

The glass eventually gave way, and the room was submerged by the rushing water. I drifted out the shattered window into the dark, wet void. I was floating, on water, or clouds or on air, it was hard to tell. The clouds soon cleared away, exposing the stars, the moon and other celestial bodies.

While one can take issue with some of the language used – fate of the whole world being one – it is important to understand the scale of the threat, and why there are no easy and quick solutions. The risks from spent fuel have been known almost since the beginning of nuclear power – the radiation levels are so high that without shielding, direct exposure to spent fuel rods is fatal. Despite this knowledge the world proceeded to deploy nuclear power reactors – led by the United States – that has created a total global inventory of over one quarter of million tons. Most of this is stored in water filled pools. In addition to creating a massive plutonium stock – 2500 tons (contained in spent fuel) and compared with the micro-grams that were valued above gold in 1944 by the engineers running the Manhattan project – the spent fuel crisis has spread worldwide to every nation operating nuclear reactors.

Nobody walks a mile in my shoes. I am sure someone looking at me, currently unemployed and overweight, I must be a loser who just sits and eats ice cream all day.

So while I understand that Khloe Kardashian is on TV and we see her life that she allows us to see, we don't know any of her struggles, we don't necessarily know what her struggles are that she doesn't share with us or that person that has an affair on their spouse, I'm not saying it's right, but we don't know what has gone on in that relationship prior to it so who am I to judge her.
Thomas Nelson was originally founded as a Scottish bookseller in Edinburgh in 1798. The company began selling second-hand religious books but quickly developed the Thomas Nelson publishing imprint. Throughout the nineteenth century it continued to publish both religious and non-religious books until close to the turn of the century when non-religious books accounted for 94% of published material. The American division of Thomas Nelson began in 1854 in New York and by the 1870s was one of the city's most important firms.

The sausage is always a favorite in my household because the girls just keep on asking for more hotdogs! I think they could have finished the entire smoked sausage if I would have let them. Also, the surprise of the night was the goat cheese. I have never had it and I thought it was going to be gross, but just the opposite, it is really good! Anna and Lucy kept wanting more and Sarah liked it but was way too into the sausage. Emily on the other hand, wiped it on the table exclaming "DISGUSTING!" This was an enjoyable meal that featured no fighting or refusing to eat.

As far as promoting the small-government/no government interference aspects of Republicanism, the executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, Patrick Guerriero does it best when it comes to commentating on Santorum: “There is nothing conservative about allowing law enforcement officials to enter the home of any American and arrest them for simply being gay… Mainstream America is embracing tolerance and inclusion. I am appalled that a member of the United States Senate leadership would advocate dividing Americans with ugly hate filled rhetoric.” These comments were released after Santorum told AP reporters in 2005 that he supported Texas anti-sodomy laws, and their enforcement.

Just got such a beautiful message on facebook … thought I’d share it. It restored my faith in men.

These slender cucumbers are ideal for pickling as they absorb the flavors very quickly. They are excellent for salads, salsas or as a healthy nibble. And they pair well with mint, parsley, cumin, and citrus. Use them in yogurt as cooling agents with spicy dishes. They are a welcome treat for any meal. I can’t have enough of them in salads, sandwiches, yogurt or just as a snack.

Still, it is a great game and it has dealt with some of the unfair spells from heroes 3, like town portal, dimension door and implosion. They are still there but they no longer guarantee victory as soon as you have got them. The wizard heroes are still the best though but there are a few armies that can get by with out a wizard- like Sylvan, the elven city, because they have their druids… Okay so magic still rules but that is okay really, because you play this game for the beauty of the animations. After all it is a very well done update to heroes 3.

Pricey some would argue for what is essentially 4 x40g portions, however, most of the ingredients would be hard to find in a supermarket (lemon infused sultanas anyone?!) and from a health shop it would probably cost you that much to walk through the door! For me, prior to losing weight, I think on average I would spend at least £5 per weekend on junk, and that would just be weekends. I never realised before, but junk is costly! For me, Graze works out cheaper than the way I was living previously, and it is a real treat to come home to on a Wednesday evening. Plus the separation of the 4 punnets means you could take one to work each day (unless you find them too irresistible and scoff them all at once – it is easily done!)

So you’d imagine my surprise when my mother-in-law made a fruit pizza while visiting us a few weeks back. I took one bite and thought I’d gone to heaven. (Just so you know, I’d never tasted the likes of the fruit pizza…) Sister quickly pointed out that the crust of said pizza was made of…sugar cookie dough.

I, Gina, absolutely love being a stay at home mom with my three girls. Between running the kids around, making meals, changing diapers, feeding, cleaning, and doing all that us mom’s do, I find time for crafting in between. It seems like there is always a project (or three or four) that I working on. I have had a lot of opportunity this year to work on service projects and have really enjoyed it. I am much like Rylie and really enjoy reading. I work with the Young Women at church and absolutely love it!

The novel implies that lacunae are somewhat mysterious, especially because the protagonist himself is very introverted compared to the majority of his friends and associates. I don’t think lacunae necessarily are meant to provoke speculation about someone else’s life, but they do imply depth, a Something More than what we can see or read. They’re a reminder that there is more substance to a person than the words on a page, more than their exterior selves might show, no matter how much we think a person is revealed through what they write.
"Daddy, there's a monster in the room," a timid voice would reply. Now, I had more than one choice of how to respond. I could tell my frightened boy that it was not true, there was no monster, go back to sleep. That response is the equivalent of reading a book that says, "We're all one, there is no problem, just be with what is." Fine ideas, but they don't help much. I could also have offered to feed the monster cookies, talk with the monster, negotiate. That approach is like some kinds of psychotherapy. Treat the problem as real, then fix it on its own terms. But the only real solution I ever found was to have a good look. Under the bed, in the closet, behind the curtains, we undertook an exhaustive search.

Genreich’s designs have an almost architectural quality to them: cone shaped helmets, the infamous topless bathing suit, mask-like hats that cover half the face; some of them can be viewed in the modeling scene in “Blow Up”, along with Ms. Moffitt herself. He was the ultimate designer, endlessly inventive with shapes, patterns, and printed fabrics. The ingenuity of his designs displayed in the upper showroom were rich in color, composition and shape, a true inspiration for anyone even remotely interested in fashion design. I will definitely return to “The Total Look” before it closes in late May.

While sitting with them we received news that two male Rhino had been found on our route a little further to the South. It appeared the tar road was the place to be and we once again set off South. Having taken our time getting to the sighting the previous station had left them unattended but was confident that they would not move far as they seemed very content grazing in the area. After finding there tracks and Jacky following up on foot for five minutes we found them not far away still grazing around the termite mounds in the area. These two males have become extremely relaxed with our presence and now approach the vehicles to within a couple of metres while they go about their feeding, which provides us with some great sightings. With not many vehicles driving we were able to spend some quality time with them eventually leaving them as they headed into thicker

On an unrelated note, I’ve been getting into drinking (store-brand) seltzer rather than soda and have actually grown to like the taste.

Still, it’s better than brandy. Slainte!

An example of the Little Red symbology in play is Jin-Roh. And Jin-Roh is, by all means, the best fictional depiction of what it means to be a wolf, in my humble opinion, in the context of Japanese pop culture. It’s a little more psychologically edgier than the simple “ronin” or lone wolf concept, which is more about the individualism that we Americans associate with our cultural heritage. Indeed, in order to appear wolf-like, these individuals have to exist alongside with normal human beings, and even work with them. It is very hard to act aloof and deceptive if there’s nobody close to you. It’s why the Big Bad Wolf gets to have a conversation with Little Red Riding Hood. The culture of fitting in, as it is in Japan, makes the wolf blend in to his or her environs easier. It’s the wolf’s disguise.

Fort Clatsop was the "home" built by the Lewis and Clark team while they wintered near the Pacific coast. The fort housed twenty-seven enlisted men in three separate quarters. Lewis and Clark shared the captains' quarters, and Sacagawea and fam got a room of their own. It is thought that Clark's slave, York, stayed in the orderly room. That means that 31 men, one woman, an infant, and a dog all shared about 250 square feet of space.

John had found the book very important and Trevor had really liked it. Ann found it of great historical interest. I asked them what they thought of it as a novel and they all instantly said, Not much. Mainly they found the prose pretty primitive and thought there were too many characters - although I have to say that when I came to read the whole thing I didn't agree about the latter: in terms of plot, as the book progresses everything including the characters is pulled together. There is constant seemingly uncontrolled slippage of tenses, and some repetition, but apparently much of the book is written in dialect German, and I did relish Michael Hofmann's rough-and-ready idiomatic translation. Doug said that he thought the book was atrociously written and he just hadn't liked it at all, but had thought it worth reading for the political content. They all agreed that the characters weren't at all well developed - though I have to say I subsequently found the insight into the psychology of the Gestapo detective Escherich, for instance, quite sophisticated. However, it's true that often the prose and especially the dialogue, most notably that between the Quangels, is stilted and naive. On the whole I'd say that the book suffers from unevenness - which is perhaps unsurprising, given the speed with which it was written and the fact that Fallada died before publication - and I'd agree that despite its aesthetic faults, for political reasons it's a must-read.
That being said, the advancement of the gay agenda continues to be predicated on the notion that homosexuals are an oppressed group in our society. This continues despite the fact that as a group they have higher levels of education than their heterosexual counterparts, they generally have higher incomes than heterosexuals and have no restrictions in terms of where they live or what they do for a living. As a group gays have a very sympathetic ear in the media as well as educational and governmental institutions. These are measures of equality, but the current concern isn’t so much about equality and freedom as it is about sanctioning and normalizing homosexual relationships. On this front the gay agenda has met much more resistance and as a result gay rights advocates have lashed out against the group they see as being the primary barrier to full acceptance – believing Christians.

Avoiding artificial light in the hour before bed can also be beneficial, because artificial light can hamper the production of melatonin, which is an important sleep-regulating chemical. If students are revising before bed, then it is best to stick to books, using just enough light to be able to see without straining their eyes. Computers, televisions and mobile phones all give off artificial light, so should therefore be switched off.

Wowzers. Suddenly we've got concept artwork out the wazoo. (That's where the other Imagineers thought it came from, too.) By this point, Walt had added Davis, Coats, and Atencio to the team. All of them had their individual ideas to pitch to Walt. Then came that infamous episode in late fall, 1964 (summarized two posts ago), in which Walt made it crystal clear to everyone working on the attraction that he really liked Rolly's nightmarish creations and wanted them incorporated into the finished project in the form of a "Museum of the Weird." The Museum never happened, of course, and it's difficult to know exactly how all of this surreal material was going to be used in the house itself. Heck, Rolly freely admits that he himself didn't know, which is why Walt had to find a solution to the problem. So you wonder, would a 1963 Mansion have included things like this? Or did these 1964 creations represent a fresh departure after the Fair? Or . . . well, it's not clear.

As if the 'tween market weren't grating enough, Gen X alumnus Stephanie Meyer saw fit to unleash a florid melodrama that wed the gothic window dressing of Buffy the Vampire Slayer with the vacuous intrigue of The O.C. Released just as the core Harry Potter acolytes began to deal with hormones and acne, the Twilight series took middle academia by storm, selling millions of copies worldwide and providing a new unattainable ideal for lovelorn teen girls everywhere. In a definitive usurpation of Hollywood's reliable 14- to-19-year-old male demographic, the Twilight movie dominated box office receipts upon its release in November; suddenly, vampire kids were everywhere, "stupid lamb" had entered the national lexicon, and Robert Pattison had become an overnight sex god. And everyone who wasn't in love with Edward Cullen found themselves wishing they could drive a stake right through his heart.

My philosophy about music lessons is fairly relaxed, as you can probably tell. If my children show an interest in a particular instrument, I will offer them the opportunity to learn it at home for a while. For example, we have the Worship Guitar Lessons on dvd if they want to learn guitar. I highly recommend those. Jean Welles has a very patient manner and the format is excellent for wannabe guitarists young or old (here is another video lesson site I found for free, if you have a child who already knows the basics---check out The Guitarmann.) Once they demonstrate that they are committed to the prospect of daily practices and learning, I will support paying for private lessons, if they are desired. This is the first time Tex has shown consistent long-term interest in something musical, and should he continue along this vein with the resources we have available, I will see about getting him some formal lessons.

After seven semesters and 100s of classroom hours at Bloomfield I've started to identify an emergent framework for undergraduate study of "studio" music as a combination of creative and technical practice with historical and cultural study. The music industry is undergoing a cataclysmic transformation right now. and from what I can tell (looking at job postings and course offerings) many music departments at colleges and conservatories are stubbornly resisting the uncomfortable questions that this transformation raises for their curricula and pedagogy. I believe that creative and cultural workers will be highly sought after in the 21st century economy yet many of our music majors are being given a seriously dated education that ill-prepares them for this exciting yet dangerously uncertain field. Furthermore, many musicians are being excluded wholesale from the serious study of music because they lack the traditional pre-requisites (instrumental training, knowledge of jazz or classical music, ability to read music, etc) or because they are interested in popular music. My students have many careers open to them and most will wear several hats in order to collage together a respectable living as an artist. They will be performers, composers, recording artists, engineers (recording, mixing, mastering), sound designers, producers, bloggers, DJs, venue owners, bookers, teachers and live sound engineers. They will work at record labels, game design firms, post-production houses, event companies, marketing firms, radio stations, studios, internet start-ups, and even for sports teams. And their musical training will serve them in all of these roles.

Sminthian Apollon. Is he the protector of mice, or the destroyer of mice (and are mice really just an obscure metaphor for mortals, in the overall view of his relationship toward us)? Does he cause, or does he repel the infestation? I say yes, yes and yes. Smintheus, the Plague-bearer, revealed to us in all his terrible glory in the Iliad, is the root cause of pestilence. While, as the Healer, the god is also in the ultimate position of control over its outcome. Mice are host to a range of diseases, but they are also instrumental in the development of modern medicine.

Quite what it says about me that I've kept a corner of my mind open to information about such extremes of existence, I'm not sure - but there's a desire in there to try to comprehend or at least apprehend such suffering and adversity. I know that part of it is informed by the sheer proximity of such great and terrible events to my own lifetime: WWII ended a mere twenty-five years before I was born. Long enough to render me at a safe distance from it, but otherwise a mere blink of an eyelid, and still very much shaping the world I was born and brought up in.
