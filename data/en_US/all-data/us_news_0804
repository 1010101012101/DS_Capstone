The steps President Obama called for to accelerate us on this path should not be controversial, but they are, almost to an item, dead on arrival in a Congress where Republicans control the House of Representatives and are able to block action in the Senate. Ending tax breaks for companies that outsource jobs? An unacceptable tax increase. Calling for an end to tax breaks for oil companies and the creation of new ones for clean energy innovation? Shades of Solyndra. And ensuring that Warren Buffett's secretary —in the House gallery to underscore the point — pays a lower share of her income in taxes than her billionaire boss? Class warfare.

If you wanted to be overly critical of "Margin Call," I suppose you could argue that it's a little too clever for its own good.

Hey, Tony: After listening to Holmgren and Heckert speak, it reiterated my theory as to why the Browns have been so consistently poor since 1999. It starts at the top with Randy Lerner. He has to be the only owner in the entire NFL that is completely invisible to the public. He never speaks out about our lack of success, our dearth of talent, our need to win now, etc., like all of the other owners when their teams fail. I think the fact that he is invisible and doesn't put any pressure on the people below him causes the front office personnel to lack any sense of urgency, which is why we always hear that "it is a process" when we are terrible instead of becoming the 49ers or even the Bengals who became playoff teams in one year. Your thoughts? -- Josh McRoberts, Shaker Heights

When I joined the Howard County police department in 1974, I was the first woman hired to perform routine patrol duties that previously had been performed only by men. I was assigned to work with Sgt. Ed Wessel, who had been around a while and was, let's just say, a traditionalist. It was clear that he and others in the nearly 100-man force were at best uncertain how women would integrate and perform in law enforcement. But Ed Wessel was a professional who worked diligently to give me the same support, encouragement, guidance and respect he had given to every other rookie officer during that era of transition. He was fair.

Never mind that this led to a train wreck with Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr after the deadlocked election of 1800, necessitating a constitutional amendment.

That is why passes have to be thrown on time to precise spots on the field or aimed at specific body areas. The "back-shoulder throw" is almost as indefensible in the NFL as a well-executed pick-and-roll is in the NBA. Eli Manning is one of the best at the play.

Menzies began her career in juvenile justice, where she first discovered her passion for protecting the "little guy."

New Hampshire, which allows independents to vote in its primary, will help decide whether a candidate with Santorum's focus can appeal to a broader electorate, as would be required in a successful general election.

Modern social conservatives, in my experience, do not hate black people en masse. To the contrary, there are two kinds of blacks they love. The first is those, like Ms. Rice, who are mainly mute on the subject of race, seldom so impolite as to say or do anything that might remind people they are black. The second is those who will engage on race, but only to lecture other blacks for their failures as conservatives conceive them. And that, friends and neighbors, is Herman Cain all over.

The president will return from his vacation ready to offer a plan of tax cuts for jobs and other incentives in early September. But it may be too late. Because of his apparent concern for his own re-election, he may have suffered a self-inflicted wound from which he can't recover.

(It was also cleverly spelled "hallouini" on the menu, perhaps to reflect the fact that the dish was both a treat and a neat trick.)

I want to tell him that a good place to start is for the church to simply be the church. To do the things the church is supposed to do, the holy things, for holy people, on holy ground (to borrow from the trilogy by liturgical scholar Gordon Lathrop).

As planners have cast Belval as a symbol of the region's economic future, the project has moved forward haltingly, with one foot in Europe's recent past. Some 25,000 people used to work in the metal industry in Luxembourg, whose "terres rouges"—red lands—are known for rich iron deposits. Now, fewer than one-fifth of that number is employed in the industry. Depleted iron-ore deposits and competition from low-cost steel producers abroad have forced layoffs and plant closures. One of Belval's furnaces was disassembled and shipped to China.

The court overturned the conviction of two men found to have violated a state law against same-sex sodomy. But in reaching that conclusion, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy offered a paean to intimate relationships defined by sexuality that easily can be transferred to the context of same-sex marriage, and potentially to polygamous marriages as well:
The hourlong piece is staged by Leah C. Gardiner and acted by the ensemble in relentlessly intense fashion, with Quincy Tyler Bernstine ("Ruined") particularly powerful as one of the sisters.

To start with the basics, you'll need four TV sets and four Xbox 360s. On top of that, you'll need four copies of the games you intend on playing. Four Ethernet cables are needed to connect the four consoles together. To connect them together, an Ethernet hub with at least four inputs can be used, but a router can be used as well. Simply plug in all four cables to the hub or router and the consoles should be able to set up a local area network (LAN) connection. Once your mini network is set up, all you need before you can game is 16 controllers and lots of batteries for the controllers.

I even made the latter with cooked trimmings of bolted lettuce from the garden and it was terrific.

One technique in particular - functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) - holds the greatest legal promise and peril. By placing a person's head in what is essentially a large magnet and asking questions, researchers can link active brain anatomy to different cognitive skills - reason, decision-making and logic and perhaps even locating the neural pathways for lying and addiction. As opposed to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which shows the brain's structure, fMRI charts how the brain functions and thereby relates more closely to thought and behavior.

Now the unions as well as corporations -- whose executives, while acting as individuals, frequently help politicians raise money -- can expand their involvement by making and airing their own commercials to elect or defeat specific candidates.

There are really only three laws at the national level making it harder for dangerous people to get firearms. There are restrictions on access to machine guns and other fully automatic weapons that date back to the end of the Prohibition era; categories of "prohibited purchasers," such as felons and the dangerously mentally ill, as established in the Gun Control Act of 1968, passed after Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. were assassinated; and the Brady Law -- named after Ronald Reagan's former press secretary, James Brady, who was seriously injured during the 1981 assassination attempt on the president -- which requires federally licensed gun dealers to check the records of "prohibited purchasers" supplied voluntarily by the states.

These are not lightly chosen words and Santorum doesn’t take them lightly, and that is to his credit.

When the stories give Brampton enough time to show off his analytic skills and develop them, he comes across as an amiable sort who balances his professional duties with keen interest in his wife and travels to places like Paris, Washington and Baltimore -- the last a subtle hat tip to Poe. Too many of the leaves, however, end abruptly, their denouements rushed toward execution, suicide or other macabre solutions. The descriptions of these deaths seem to contradict Brampton's assertion that he doesn't like "dealing in the horrible; it is pandering to a morbid taste."

That "community" includes Rosa Rubio, a Minneapolis mother who won't be among the sea of pink-clad runners and walkers at the Mall of America next Sunday. She and a dozen friends who typically join the race instead will be participating in their own fundraising walk around Lake Nokomis.
We had a jones for walking long before we wrote our first book six years ago (six years? how did that happen!). But we've now got another new reason to walk forever AND to get your mom, uncle, pop-pop and great-aunt Tillie to go with you. Turns out that the older you are, the more important it is to walk. Because the more you walk, the happier you are. And the happier you are, the more you walk, which means the healthier you are.

Holmgren: "I saw the same thing. I would factor one more thing in and that is who they played. They play good people, highly competitive. The best in college football, so he saw a lot of speed, he had to go against really fine defensive players. It was a very intensely competitive, noisy stadiums, all of that stuff that went into where he played. I like his maturity. Again, time will tell but he is a little bit older and it shows. Not only on film, but in how he handles himself and how he deals with questions and how he conducts himself."
It also helps to account for his weeping in prison. Mr. Dreiser portrays Cowperwood, for all of his bland and ruthless competence, as someone who needs sympathy. In this respect he is perhaps not so different from Dreiser characters like the pitiful George Hurstwood of "Sister Carrie" (1900) or the pathetically striving Clyde Griffiths of "An American Tragedy."
"I think he really tries to get into the mind of the offensive coordinator," UO offensive line coach Steve Greatwood said. "That's the way he approaches it. He looks, and looks, and looks at things, and just gets into the head of the guy he is going to be calling a game against."

A: I just thought it was awesome. I never had heard it used on contemporary, modern recordings or in bands. Russ is kind of a vintage gear nerd and so he suggested I buy it. It took a little finessing, getting the right speaker for it so it didn't sound too honky (laughs). But it's got that classic late-'60s organ sound — that, I really like.

Martin has been ill, hospitalized with an e-coli infection, and wasn't sure he'd be able to attend HBO's "Game of Thrones" panel.

It's a different mind-set from the time when speed - getting passengers swiftly across "the Pond," as the Atlantic was nicknamed - was the goal of the cr�me of the ocean-liner trade.
I don't have a problem with what Snead and head coach Jeff Fisher did Thursday, trading out of the No. 6 slot the moment the receiver they truly coveted (Justin Blackmon) had gone off the board one pick earlier. So they traded the sixth pick, getting Dallas to give up its first- (No. 14 overall) and second-rounders (No. 45 overall). And by dropping to No. 14, Snead and Fisher missed out on Notre Dame receiver Michael Floyd, too (Arizona got him at No. 13).
That turn of events would have been impossible to predict three years earlier, when, while researching nursing programs, Ward sent out applications to two prestigious writing fellowships.

You probably know your barbecue: Bludso's in Compton for meaty beef ribs; sliced brisket from Phillips in Leimert Park; maybe farmers market fixture Bigmista's platter of pulled pork, ribs, brisket and links.

So why then is a famous public intellectual saying such misleading things? Maybe because his fame comes from doing work in physics, not in political economy. And maybe also because through most of history gaining wealth was a zero-sum game – riches were gained at the expense of somebody else – not the win-win situation that modern economists have found far more productive. Peace, not ripping people off, is the road to riches.

Offering a 401(k)-style plan without participating in Social Security would definitely place the city of San Diego as an outlier. I am unaware of another place in the U.S. where a public or private employer only offers a 401(k)-style plan without participating in Social Security.

These models move public employees to portable 401(k)-style plans while ensuring a minimum return on their retirement investment.

Unless we speed up these internal probes, they’ll remain “a form of punishment,” as this trooper, Randy Pangborn, put it. His gripe is legit, according to a new report from New Jersey’s comptroller.

Wet-hop ales are made with hop cones that have been rushed directly from vine to brewery without the customary kilning and pressing into bales. Sierra Nevada uses two hop varieties, Cascade and Centennial, that ripen at different times, with an overlap of less than a week.

Chipotle chile is a transformed jalapeno, smoky and sweet, hotter than ancho but milder than habanero pepper. Sprinkling it from a jar works well, but grinding it or another spice bursts its flavors loose. Spice Islands adds sweet red pepper, onion, garlic, sea salt and other spices to its grinder for a "potent kick of heat." Tomatillos' "pucker" contrasts mild tomatoes. Cilantro merges into the mixture, too.

The earned average figure compiled by Sanchez was a bit misleading as to how effective he had been this spring. Sanchez, who probably has the best swing-and-miss stuff on the staff (he struck out 14), walked five batters and hit four others and both manager Mike Matheny and general manager John Mozeliak want the 23-year-old Venezuelan to shorten his delivery so that he can have better command.
