Now I'm off to sleep with the hope that I'll be somewhat better in the morning.
Of course, Johannson adds that it makes Obama look like a willing accomplice and a liar, but, he says, “…show me a politician who cares about being seen as a liar by the public. If people who support him want to vote for a person like that, it reveals more about the reprobate character of Obama supporters than competency of any legal determination about his lack of constitutional eligibility. Degenerates will vote for a degenerate while patriots will exhaust all civil means to remove him…until those civil means are exhausted. Then things get ugly for government.”
I only ask you do not sell them as your own work or design, and do not add them to your silver scrap bin, as I could easily do this myself.
As wonderful as my Easter weekend was, I shared it with leprous boils on my forearms. My right forearm is especially nasty, with welts of infection that look like I repelled an Indiana Jones bullwhip attack.
Anyway.....Today I wanted to share with you a layout I did using the April kit from The Sampler. I know, I keep going on about how much I love this kit, and I do. It has been so versatile. A Book of Me page, pictures of Ainsley and Lili playing in the yard, and today....
Time to sew! Stitch the four squares together end to end. You will sew them on the 1.5 side RST. Repeat until you have all four together. Press.
Why? Because it was so so so so boring to read this proposal. It was very painful.

I was under the weather yesterday. It's a situation that's always a bit unnerving since I live alone. What if something went very wrong? I always wonder about that when I don't feel well. Fortunately yesterday I realized whatever virus was passing through me was mild, hence was able to turn my mind to other things.
The suspect was taken into custody after a brief struggle which involved the use of a taser, pepper spray, frequent blows from batons, and ended in the suspect thoroughly wetting and soiling himself.

that’s at least a place to start;
Somehow, in the immediate aftermath of 911, I came across a plastic flag pin and wore it. I participated in the lights on all night solidarity of the masses. I stayed online, seeking information while the TV alternated between hurricane warnings and Bushisms. This went on for about two days, soundtracked by hammers slamming up storm shutters until hurricane pundits were all that was on 24 hours straight, drowning out the bullhorns and crazy pilots. And then the power went out. The winds howled, the foundations shook, the trees were breaking, sheets of rain beat its way into every crevice, the animals racing around the interior, horrified. It came to me our present was all that mattered and would always be all that matters. Everything else is extraneous manufactured prototypical stuffing except for the fundamental basics, our loved ones peace of mind which means of course, we have to be there for them in whatever way is possible. This is why, especially in these harsh times, we dutifully get up every day and square off with dragons so that our loved ones will not have the same struggle.
One of the comedians sitting with me in the green room is one of the most popular and best lesbian comedians of all time, in my humble opinion. She’s just very good at what she does. When I told her about this, she said, “Oh, they’ll never let that happen. They’ll never let that happen. Men would become extinct. Men would become extinct if they ever let that happen. If women didn’t need sperm from men, men would become extinct.”
Even if you never take up Reiki, at least look at the messages you’re sending or receiving by the information your mind is absorbing. Something as simple as “Saturn Return” is akin to a root canal in so many minds. But its really about letting go and willing to be reborn.
If these organisations continue to think within the box and do not expand their struggling objective from Malays to the country and all Malaysians, the country will forever split. The country’s economic pie will not be able to expand without the cooperation of all Malaysians. How could you expect others to help you if you think only about the interests of your own racial group?
I used Stampin Up cardstock (banana, celery, & regal rose), and a variety of designer papers from Basic Grey and DCWV. Copic colors used were: E11, E00, E000, & R20 (face, legs, & elbow); E25, E99, E33, & YR21 (hair); R85, R83, R81 (dress); G24, G21, & G20 (pinafore & socks); E57, E47, & E43 (shoes). Because the papers were so busy, I opted to go very simple on embellishments! I decided to decorate the inside a bit as well...to tie it in with the front. I hope you enjoy her!
Unfortunately, we didn't get any post-race medal pictures, except the professional one they took. Hopefully that one will turn out good!
12 Because of this, just as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin, so also death came to to all men inasmuch as all sinned; 13 for sin indeed was in the world before the law, but sin is not accounted when there is no law. 14 But Death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not unto the likeness of the transgression of Adam who is a type of the one who was to come. (Romans 5:12-14 Possessing the Treasure New Testament V1)

But the answer to my question is much more ominous, ominous for my readers living in the West, both the USA and EU and in Japan and China. Quite frankly, the end is here. China is already in free fall for the past three months, with over 200 property retailers closing in Beijing, just this month and real estate prices dropping by as much as 30% in the first tier cities, wiping out the savings of tens of millions in the Shadow Banking market, even as provincial budgets go bust for lack of fees from property sales.
Having time to yourself to do something that you enjoy without the pressure of chores, demands or other interruptions is vital to keeping your life balanced. Make the time. Don't feel guilty about dropping the kids off with a friend or a relative. The time you give yourself is time to recharge. Without it, you may be more likely to yell at the kids more or get upset over insignificant issues.

The City of Atlanta, City of Decatur, Atlanta Bicycle Coalition, Atlanta Regional Commission and National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) will be hosting the Atlanta Cities for Cycling Road Show on March 29-30, 2012. This is your opportunity to learn how cities around the United States are redesigning their streets to be more bicycle-friendly. Representatives from Austin, Boston, the District of Columbia and nationally-recognized bicycle planning and design firms will share lessons learned and best practices in bikeway design, bike sharing, and related topics.
I have also finished the second of the Silver Trilogy books. I feel drained. It is a mesmerizing, but totally uncomfortable series. I repeat, read at your own risk. I do not recommend it. I hope to have the third book finished this week so I can rest and recuperate. R & R. Like Gary had from Viet Nam. I wonder if they still do that for the soldiers? Like in the Middle East--a brief 5-day respite from the war. And where do they go? To China? Russia? Hmmmm....in our days it was Thailand, or, as in Gary's case, Hawaii. Yeah, I could use a trip to Hawaii right after I finish this series. Too bad I have to wait until April. Oh, yeah, I'm sure you're thinking, wah, poor baby. Aren't you? LOL. Probably not.
A prostitute I’d had bitter, half-drunken sex with had said the jacket made me look like Lewis Collins. Nobody had ever paid me a compliment before, so I’d let her off with an £80 fixed penalty notice instead of arresting her for solicitation.
The new Seton Infirmary was large by Austin standards, but to the Sisters, who were used to doing things on a large scale, the place seemed rather small. In 1912, a twenty-bed west wing was added, with a chapel, and, in keeping with the way things were back then, separate wards for whites, Hispanics, and African-Americans.

"The agency has for too long ignored what I believe is the root cause of these unintended acceleration cases," he said. "It's driver error." But this isn't news to ad contras. What's really news is that the government is refusing to release this information.
Putting my passport in the mail and shipping it off is very uncomfortable for me. I love that some countries don’t require visas or make them easy to get. Unfortunately, some countries are not quite as flexible; for example, China. I just picked up my passport at UPS fresh from the Chinese Consulate, tourist visa intact. Phew! This was just one of the many items of paperwork I had to complete this month. Oh yes, that is right, I’m also going to China this summer.
It is easy to turn a digi image into a rubon. Just make sure you use the mirror image setting if it has wording and print on the shinny side of a transparency. Once it is printed just rub. It takes a little more pressure but it works!
Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be in an anime. I could choose to be some mech pilot, or have powers to fight crime and do random shit to people, or even be surrounded by tons of girls who would fight over me. You know, all the things that could never happen in real life (especially number 3). But then I remembered what age groups all of the people who take these roles are: teenagers.
I told Jean Yves about the nest. I told him it was hanging so low I could touch it. He told me that when a bee’s nest is built low, it means we will have warm weather this winter. While I am familiar with the use of a groundhog to predict if spring will arrive early or late, I’ve never thought much about using insects. Our conversation got me curious on what other insect weather predictions there are. Especially, since I noticed that there are still a lot of dragonflies and spiders hanging around. Normally they would be gone by now…
Now you can capture the beauty of the English rose for your wedding!
Each strand of the pendant has charms that I chose for both meaning and sparkle. I’ve always loved leaves and their ability to bloom even after a cold winter, while dragonflies are the epitome of strength and grace. On the third strand is the all important “believe” ring, an infinite tribute to the idea of believing without fail. Just as Wollstonecraft kept writing, so will I.

With the kind permission of Supertram four librarians spent part of their morning giving away 150 copies of Oliver Twist to passengers on the tram. To be honest, I wasn’t at all sure what to expect: I see people reading on the tram all the time so I’d presumed they were a cultured lot, but going up to anyone at random to ask them if they wanted to read some Dickens felt quite daunting. If no one wanted a copy I’d have felt quite foolish.

(no worries, friends - dee, the strongest person i know, is doing great!!)
“Poor and sorrowful I am” (ver. 30). Why this? Is it that we may acknowledge that through bitterness of soul this poor One doth speak evil? For He hath spoken of many things to happen to them. And as if we were saying to Him, “Why such things?”-”Nay, not so much!” He answereth, “poor and sorrowful I am.” They have brought Me to want, unto this sorrow they have set Me down, therefore I say these words. It is not, however, the indignation of one cursing, but the prediction of one prophesying. For He was intending to recommend to us certain things which hereafter He saith of His poverty and His sorrow, in order that we may learn to be poor and sorrowful. For, “Blessed are the poor, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.” And, “Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.” This therefore He doth Himself before now show to us: and so, “poor and sorrowful I am.” The whole Body of Him saith this. The Body of Christ in this earth is poor and sorrowful. But let Christians be rich. Truly if Christians they are, they are poor; in comparison with the riches celestial for which they hope, all their gold they count for sand. “And the health of Thy countenance, O God, hath taken Me up.” Is this poor One anywise forsaken? When dost thou deign to bring near to thy table a poor man in rags? But again, this poor One the health of the countenance of God hath taken up: in His countenance He hath hidden His need. For of Him hath been said, “Thou shalt hide them in the hiding place of Thy countenance.” But in that countenance what riches there are would ye know? Riches here give thee this advantage, that thou mayest dine on what thou wilt, whenever thou wilt: but those riches, that thou mayest never hunger. “The health of Thy countenance, O God, hath taken Me up.” For what purpose? In order that no longer I may be poor, no longer sorrowful? “I will praise the name of the Lord with a song, I will magnify Him in praise” (ver. 31). Now it hath been said, this poor One praiseth the name of the Lord with a song, he magnifieth Him in praise. When would He have ventured to sing, unless He had been refreshed from hunger? “I will magnify Him with praise.” O vast riches! What jewels of God’s praise hath he brought out of his inward treasures! These are my riches! “The Lord hath given, the Lord hath taken away.” Then miserable he hath remained? Far be it. See the riches: “As it hath pleased the Lord, so hath been done, be the name of the Lord blessed.”

I would like you to imagine taking a trip by foot, or maybe by local bus, from New York City to Albany. This trip by foot would take you several days, so let's assume that there's a hotel to stay at wherever you need one. I've chosen Albany because it's completely in the State of New York, but you would see similar (but less rural) phenomena if you went to Philadelphia or New Haven.

I went into an all out flail. Kicking,shouting,bucking, pounding my fists on his back. Anything I had to do to get him to set me down was not beneath me.

So glad it's Friday!! It's been another torrid week at work... I seem to remember days in the dim and increasingly distant past when work was a pleasure, but all so stressful now there are so few of us left to do more and more. I know things will get better eventually (like, I might win the lottery!!) but right now it's horrid!!
I need to start this post by letting you in on a personal situation regarding my relationship with my husband. Several years ago I had to put hubby on jacket detention. It was either this or something much more drastic such as a family intervention was going to be necessary. The kids really were reluctant to get this involved so I took action into my own hands and just did it. It was hard on all of us for a while, but hubby was strong and resisted. I've been so proud of him, especially in January when he walks through Dillards and sees all the nice jackets on sale.
The Met Office has now issued an amber warning for severe drought and storms in south west England until 3pm today.
There are however two ways that street fishers do like to differentiate themselves from other members of the fishing community. Firstly, the activity should no longer be seen as sedentary, but one based on mobility. The street fisher uses lightweight material, and moves around to find the best spot at a particular moment. Secondly, street fishers never keep fish out of the water for any significant length of time, and never eat their catch. “We are militants” explains Pierron, “militants for a modern, responsible form of fishing”. He calls the method used ‘catch and release’, but the website displays grafitti style logos for the NoKillGeneration.

Do I love it? Do I hate it? Honestly, I don't know any more. I think it might look like the ill-advised haircut just-cut-it-all-off haircut I got when I was pregnant with Z. Or it might be a perfectly nice age-appropriate style.

Several young non-Muslim men have been murdered, often for allegedly being "gay". Many local Muslims despise Britain (yet live here) because we have a tolerant and inclusive society that excepts homosexuality and the sexual liberation of women. Attacking someone because you perceive they are "gay" is a convenient way of disguising blatant murderous racism with "homophobia". It is not an attack on one gay man but an attack on British society and values as a whole.

That problem aside, I’ve still tried to follow a structure that makes sense for how an actual course might play out: works build on previously read works to allow for connections to be made, I begin with shorter texts rather than hitting students with something big and hard to start, and finish with less time-intensive texts so that students in the midst of final papers and finals prep would hopefully still make time for them.

It had been hoped that both the content and format of the moralism scale would have precluded the type of responding described above-where the 'do what is right' alternative is seen as being to some extent equivalent to 'do what is to your own advantage'. Since it appeared that this might not have happened as planned in some instances, a further scale of the classical 'attitude to -' type seemed called for -- in this case 'attitude to morality'. This scale would take as its focus the issue that the moralism scale had eschewed -- i.e. whether there is or not an objective Right and Wrong. The items of the scale constructed to fill this need are given in the appendix.

We get to the diner -- it's full. Okay, we go to another diner, the Blue Fountain down on the Lincoln Highway. I took the Saab, revving it high and stoking more amps into the battery. We get into the diner, sit right down, and that's when Cathy and Thomas tell me that he had not just forgotten his computer...he'd forgotten his dorm room keys as well. But he has them now -- thanks to Nora! -- and all's well, and we have a big laugh, and a great last breakfast together before taking Thomas back to school. The Saab starts, we drive back to the house, leave Nora with lots of hugs (and pets to the Corgis, who are now thoroughly confused), and get back on the way to Boston...over two hours later than planned.
And fighting time so hard I pray
People complain about all the young hoodlums being out on the streets, and rightly so, but they are nowhere near as bad as geezers. With the kids, you have the hope that eventually they will wise the fuck up, and learn to stop shitting themselves, but old people are useless; their best days are over. They now spend their time trying to remember what the fuck they have done with their teeth, and drooling on themselves.
At the same time there are people who are there for me unconditionally and I know that they only have our best intentions at heart - and I should focus on that but it is hard.

Many Shubs and Zuuls and Bruins knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Sloar that day, I can tell you!

Thank you, Mark and girls for making my week of celebration so great. It was so relaxing and so special for me.
Even though I wasn’t much interested at first in most aspects of modern American history, in grad school I had become fascinated with the impact of war on the American homefront. Once I started my teaching career, I continued to read about how the Civil War, World Wars I and II, and the Korean conflict had affected those Americans who had not fought in them and even included some of that in my APUSH course. Since I had experienced at least some of Vietnam’s impact on the homefront first-hand, I felt that there was a lecture there as well, but I also knew that I couldn’t write it until I understood better how we’d gotten involved in the conflict in the first place.

I've been a big fan of Henning Wehn since I saw him supporting Stewart Lee during his If You Prefer a Milder Comedian Please Ask For One tour. I was just enjoying some YouTube clips of "The Germam Comedy Ambassador" when I was reminded of his take on the British attitude to debt. The clip below was posted in 2008. It was and is very apt at the time as we as a country, were already running up enormous public and private levels of debt. It contunues to be apt as we are continuing to do so.

It’s only now, after I dove deep into the trap that I can see its walls. If I take a step back, relax and breathe I see it all. It’s all designed to keep me unhappy and ignorant. Because if I would be happy, I wouldn’t strive for anything particular. I won’t be so easily controlled. I can influence others too and then I would become a public menace. We don’t want that, do we?
Quite apart from the danger a poster like this must pose to public health (the Place de la Republique is a very busy traffic thoroughfare - how many car accidents is this poster responsible for?) the fact that it is considered appropriate for an image such as this to be on public display speaks to everything I love about this country.
But if the book lives up to the synopsis and there really is a psychological thriller, I'll be really excited and probably in love. Also it's a boarding school book so how can I not be interested?

When entering a sales negotiation, always have your minimum standards in mind and adhere to them. Be prepared to leave the business on the table if you feel the prospect is out to exploit you. It won’t help your cash flow, but you’ll be able to hold your head high and become even more savvy as you successfully sell to the next prospect.
This will be any easy one to pick only because of the Sixers lack of fire power and the Bulls play the best team defense in the league. The Bulls have proven that they can play without Derrick Rose, so the only Achilles heal I see for the Bulls in this round is how long will it take for the reigning MVP to get his legs under him in the playoffs. That will be key to how long they last in this years playoffs, but it shouldn’t be a huge problem versus the Sixers.

In High School the art teacher I didn't like moved up to teach at our school, so I never took art. I took stained glass instead because that teacher would let me explore the medium. I would make blown glass dragons and flowers and things like that.
I wonder if MIL works this Saturday. I really need to get to Bloomington to that Green Nursery store and stock up on cloth diapers. I bet Sister M will go with me. She loves B-town and will probably know where she's going better than me. I bet Mom would watch the boys for us too! I just need one day to myself to be able to shop and relax (two things that usually don't go together for me). This may be my last chance to have some "me" time before baby comes. I'll tell Husband that. He'll understand. We were just wondering if we could sneak away for "us" time, he'll understand that I need some "me" time too. . .
The first day of the tour consisted mostly of travel. We all met in the foyer of Clink Hostel in London and from there we boarded the bus to Dover. From Dover we caught a P&O ferry to Calais, France. I like to think of the Topdeck social side as the highschool experience on speed (I've also heard the comparison to Big Brother numerous times too). So the ferry ride was a little like the beginning highschool; mingling with others, getting to know everyone and eventually finding your place. The ferry ride also was one of the first of many opportunities that highlighted what social network addicts we all are- as soon as someone discovered there was free wifi somewhere there was always a flurry of activity as people pulled out there phones and tried to connect.
I thought this image would make a wonderful (and a little bit naughty) card to give to hubby on our 20th wedding anniversary last week.
Clearly there’s a lot wrong with vampires and their lifestyle wouldn’t be to everyone’s taste. But you have to admire the mature way they dealt with their relationship issues.

Wikipedia definition for Assertiveness is ” a form of behavior characterized by a confident declaration or affirmation of a statement without need of proof; this affirms the person’s rights or point of view without either aggressively threatening the rights of another (assuming a position of dominance) or submissively permitting another to ignore or deny one’s rights or point of view.”
Of course there will be those — not least the lawmakers and governors — who will say this is necessary for our protection and that therefore this is the best way.
I myself have recently been considering the prospect of serving in the United States Military. As many of you who know me, it is recognizable that I am a mild to moderate paruretic, though I have come long distances in recovery. Pissing is no longer an issue in my life anymore, as the combination of a positivist outlook and practice (with some help coming from the breath hold technique). In the last year or so of my life, there has not been a single situation in which I could not relieve myself even in the face of extreme duress (crowded concert halls, ball games, bars, etc…). Yet despite even all of the success that I have, there is a very small part of my brain in which paruresis still seems to attach itself to, I have reservations about stressful bathroom situations.
But I was curious: exactly how strong was she? I found out, though. Strong enough to bend steel. Good to know.
One of the most impressive and fascinating components of Ian's writing was definitely all of his sets of different lyrics to each song. Throughout Joy Division's approximately three year span career, just about every song went through some sort of rewrite or live variation. I love this about their songs. Common motifs of his I've always liked include knowledge, failure, Christianity and Catholicism, lines, polarity (inside and outside, black and white), loss of control, fear, lack of fear, love, and death. He had the spirit, plain and simple. Just lose the feeling. ;)
Anyway, here are the pictures!

As for me, I'm waiting for my new markers to color Red Ridding-hood in. R56 looks just perfect for her cloak!
Anhypostasis / Enhypostasis: anhypostasis (Gk: literally not-person) refers to the fact that the humanity of Jesus had no independent reality before the incarnation of the Word. Before the incarnation there was no human person Jesus. While enhypostasis (Gk. literally in-person) refers to the fact that as a result of the incarnation the humanity of Jesus did have real personhood, real personal being in the person of the Son. Jesus was a real human person whose “personal substance” was that of the second person of the trinity.
The dark/medium grey shade is a bit meh to me. Didn't use a whole lot of it in my look and wasn't a huge fan of it. That's my personal preference though. The navy shade is probably my favourite next to the black shade~ it's like a beautiful twilight blue *sodreamy*. Blending it with some of the other shades made it so pretty and there was an iridescent quality I really loved. The pearly light blue highlight shade is quite good but I wish it were a bit more pigmented. I was tempted to use a highlightng eyeshadow from another pallete to apply to my inner corners and brow bone because I just wasn't feeling it from this pearly light blue! But I think it still did a great job and I may have looked even more overdone if I had used a more pigmented highlighting shadow (although you can barely see it when I swatched it onto my arm, despite trying to layer it 2-3 times).
I don’t need to go into the many scriptural passages that mention the differences that should be between man and woman – (if you are interested, you can research yourself) but this was not the driving force for my change over into skirts and dresses. I was upset with the gender confusion of the world and the change in women dressing more like men and men dressing more like women. Just step outside and notice the more feminine that men are becoming and the more masculine women are becoming. I felt that even with wearing pants and with the trends today I could not properly cover myself the way Heavenly Father would want me to. I began to understand the seriousness in causing men to sin by looking at me in a lustful way. Would my dress cause men to look at me longer than normal? Would my dress draw attention to

For people thinking that to say “some people are gay, get over it” is at all ‘hetrophobic’ displays an ignorance or brash reaction. Being gay seems to be one of the few remaining taboos. Just as black people struggled and fought against the inequality that they were subjected, to a position of deserving equality, the LGBT community are in a similar position, only yet to reach the pivotal moment of inclusivity, equality and acceptance.

Then I got the bad news... no owls allowed. It is important to be aware of the variety of cultures we serve as teachers. In my community, owls represent death to many of the Native American tribes. It is offensive to include them in any way and so... I will resist the cuteness for the comfort of my students.

“I wasn’t alone.” Naida was looking up and smiling, it was the first sign of warmth he had seen on her face. Real warmth, Derrek knew instantly, even with such a short sentence, it was someone that meant the world to her. There was also a trace of sadness on her face, whoever it was gone, or worse. “I probably wouldn’t have been able to sleep if I was.”
God knew what was in store for all, when they went ashore and Paul could rest assured that it would all work together for good. As he wrote in 2 Timothy 1:12, “I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I’ve committed unto him against that day.” What God wills, He is able to perform.

We should be extremely thankful the Lord allows us to humble ourselves. After all, it’s not as if we will not wind up humbled at some point anyway. One day, every person in this world will kneel before Jesus Christ and confess that He is Lord over all. (Philippians 2:10-11) My old Sunday School teacher, Pastor John Wilkerson, used to say that God will get the glory from your life one way or the other. Either you will humble yourself before Him, or He will humble you involuntarily.

Anyway, there are few things Madison loves more than a rousing rendition of “Happy Birthday” and blowing out candles. Because she’s the baby, she was allowed to blow out the candles on both cakes.
“I am sure that, in my early youth, no teaching ever made such an impression upon my mind as the instruction of my mother; neither can I conceive that, to any child, there can be one who will have such influence over the young heart as the mother who has so tenderly cared for her offspring. A man with a soul so dead as not to be moved by the sacred name of “mother” is creation’s blot. Never could it be possible for any man to estimate what he owes to a godly mother. Certainly I have not the powers of speech with which to set forth my valuation of the choice blessing which the Lord bestowed on me in making me the son of one who prayed for me, and prayed with me. How can I ever forget her tearful eye when she warned me to escape from the wrath to come? I thought her lips right eloquent; others might not think so, but they certainly were eloquent to me. How can I ever forget when she bowed her knee, and with her arms about my neck, prayed, “Oh, that my son might live before Thee!” Nor can her frown be effaced from my memory—that solemn, loving frown, when she rebuked my budding iniquities; and her smiles have never faded from my recollections— the beaming of her countenance when she rejoiced to see some good thing in me towards the Lord God of Israel.”

Granted, my love letters were largely unrequited, despite being acknowledged, but they never brought the turnaround I was hoping for. They were mostly fraught with angst and severe melancholy and on re-reading them tonight , I actually wonder if they could be termed as ‘love letters’ at all. Foolish, awful, creative, god who knows….
Other items that will need to be addressed during the month of May include:
I had intended to have my whole family room ready to go by now, but last week my 4-year-old was very sick. She had a bad cold and wound up with an ear infection and pneumonia, and with my husband being out of town all week...well...you guessed it...I didn't get anything done! I was so worried about poor Caighton that I couldn't think straight anyway.
Sometimes the models get wind of what’s up, but this one seems naive. Even when I’m telling him that I just can’t stand the heat, pulling off my blouse, encouraging him to do the same, he seems puzzled. Sometimes they really think it’s a modeling gig. They’re so cute.

If history repeats itself, this means that everyone else within the "Machine" is now safe as well. Our politicans are free to careen from one side of the road to the other in their overpriced, oversized SUVs and luxury vehicles without fear of retribution. God help the rest of us as we try to stay out of their way. And don't forget, they will still be pulling in their paychecks from all of us ordinary folks while they briefly sit in jail waiting for their compadres in the Machine to bail them out.

If you’re looking for intricately designed alien cultures, vast space battles, black-hole surfing or lasers, you won’t get it in Winter Song – it’s the kind of novel that explores what SF can do and even perhaps what SF means by staying closer to home, even as it takes place on a planet very, very far away, and it’s a novel that deserves to be read and re-read and re-printed for many, many years. It’s a novel that will make you sad that Colin Harvey is no longer with us, but at the same time, it’s a novel that will stamp his name into the Mt Olympus of SF – at least, I hope so. Because it’s a damned good novel that brought back that sense of holy-freaking-hell-this-is-awesome that only incredible SF has managed to make me feel.

Thanksgiving Day proved to be a bit eventful. BF's parents were hosting dinner at their house and planned to start cooking around 7:00 AM to have the food on the table by 3:00 PM. Bright and early on Thanksgiving morning, the toilet in their basement powder room exploded (ie, ceramic bowl completely shattered), spewing water everywhere. Since that bathroom is never used, there was no real "mess"... other than the six inches of water that had spread throughout their entire finished basement. Luckily, they have a wet/dry vac and were able to remove most of the water within a few hours of the explosion. But it certainly created quite a disruption. Between their basement toilet, the flooding in my prior apartment, and a recent roof leak in my new apartment, I have never before been so convinced of the force of water!

I am not in favour of vehicular traffic and parking at Newman Court either as that would severely restrict the street level options. Newman Court could well become a laneway like hospitality area with small bars, cafes and eateries with lots of alfresco to make the square vibrant. It could however become a mixed use bicycles and pedestrians lane. For that same reason any buildings that might be built along William Street at city square need to have four facades at street level at least, so there are retail outlets opening up to the square everywhere, and not blank walls.
I also plan to do some reading, which I have been neglecting of late. A combination of the last two books I read being rather disappointing (Water for Elephants - didn't rate it and Tiger Hills - not bad per se, just predictable) and a serious lack of time.

This morning was the second day of the football tournament.
In the years 2011 – 2012 a series of events happened that led me to much soul searching. I pondered many thoughts and ideas about just “who I am” at this stage of my life and what it is that I want to accomplish with the rest of my life?
It tells us that the laws of India SHALL NOT discriminate against any one based upon their sex. Yet we see so many laws that inherently are discriminatory against men.
Colonel Yates also compliments Lucy on her appearance -- just what he wanted. As he takes her by the hand and leads her toward the other room, questions swim in Lucy's head. What is this all about? Why isn't Sir James here? Who are these people? Who is Smithson, really? And who is Colonel Yates?
Probably. While I can’t say this person or that person was represented in a character, I can see patterns from all the various people I’ve met. There were a lot of part-time employees at my previous job, so they were helpful to design characters from.
At first, I thought that humans had cut down the trees, but I saw unmistakable teeth marks from beavers on the trees. Could it be that the new swamp is a beaver pond? I thought about trying to find the spot on the creek where the water is being dammed up, but since I had already chased the wood ducks once already, I thought it best to let them rest for a day or two before I go crashing around back in there again.
My slump is equivalent to the trials of life: Stuck Fermentation: things that are buried that need to be pulled up and out! (I won't go into detail, but please google Stuck Fermentation and the causes...then put it into the perspective that I am talking about here, and wow!)
Someone wanted me dead. But who? My husband? His girlfriend? Divorce loomed ahead like a huge gaping maw. I wanted to wail, gnash my teeth, and obliterate something, anything. Of course, I was Rachel the Mouse, so I did my best to hide the violent urges building inside. Rachel the Meek never, ever, let loose with her most primitive emotions. She hid them deep, keeping a calm, submissive, accepting face turned toward the world at large.

But it can't last. Every day that we have such mild and pleasant weather, I get more nervous. I will not be lulled in to a false sense of security. It is November. The temperature will plummet. Drinkers will freeze and chickens will shiver. To that end, I have bought in porridge supplies and poultry spice. I've made sure that there is enough woodshavings to see us through should we get hit by a snowy apocolypse. I am even eyeing up a snow shovel in the afternoon sunshine, safe in the knowledge that when the first flake lands I will be prepared.
SWAT members, guns drawn, later swarmed Zinkhan's tidy middle-class suburb about seven miles from the campus and searched his two-story colonial house. They also searched his office at the university, which had issued a campus-wide alert immediately following the shooting as a precaution.
Her family moved to a new house about 10 miles away, but that did not stop us. She would just ride the bus home to my neighborhood and spend the weekend. I don't remember, but our Mothers must have decided they were going to accommodate us and they did. Since she was a year older than me, she went to the High School and I to the Middle School, this was tough.

As far as direct competition with AMD is concerned, Kepler puts Nvidia back in the driver’s seat when it comes to defining performance at a given price point. The good news, for both consumers and AMD, is that the comparison isn’t nearly as one-sided as we’ve sometimes seen in previous generations. When the GeForce FX or Radeon HD 2000 families launched, there was real reason to question if a person who bought one of these cards would get the level of performance and quality they thought they were paying for. That’s not an issue here. The HD Radeon 7000 series is a strong lineup — just not as strong as what Nvidia is serving up.

It’s not the only solution. We’re still going to have to have a strong jobs agenda. But it is part of a solution. I might add it is the primary solution that the Republicans have offered when it comes to jobs. They keep on going out there and saying, “Mr. President, what are you doing about jobs?” And when you ask them, well, what would you do? “We’ve got to get government spending under control and we’ve got to get our deficits under control.” So I say, okay, let’s go. Where are they? I mean, this is what they claim would be the single biggest boost to business certainty and confidence. So what’s the holdup?
So the plan for the rest of the year is simple: fix the ceiling and get some books. Now that I've come clean about my lack of progress, perhaps I'll also write some more blog posts - there are recent discoveries that I want to share.
And here we get to the part of the story that does feed into the future. Because once Melkur breaks the rules of the narrative the story is set up with just a bit of a problem. Namely that it has to find some account for why Melkur is able to defy the rules of the system. Doubly so within the Bidmead aesthetic, where the narrative rules of the system are paramount because they extend from the scientific rules. When Melkur breaks the rules of the Shakespearean world it is, in fact, a massive jaw-dropper of a moment. It’s just that the trick only works when you encounter the story in the wild. If you know that Melkur turns out to be the Master then the revelation is flat. If you don’t then it cuts against everything you think you know about the story simply because the story has, by all appearances, not been hiding anything prior to this point.
So start snapping those photos, pretty soon you’ll look back on 2012 and say – “Wow, look at all the fun things I did!”
But back to my main point here. Appreciation takes effort and discipline, especially if we are to expand our palate to the point where any number beers are good, depending on the context and circumstance. And here, proverbially speaking, is what separates the men from the boys because I'm not just talking one style, but all of them. The well-rounded palate enjoys lagers and ales, darks and lights, barleys and wheats, cold and room-temp, carbonated and flat, sweet and sour, and so on. Favorites may have a place, but it takes discipline to truly appreciate things we don't consider as such. And with any discipline, it takes time. No one becomes a master at anything in a few months; we must invest patience and time into those things that are worth mastering.
On late arrival at Ermita, we checking on Rivera Mansion Hotel, where behind Hyatt Hotel and along the Madinini Street.

Annie- Annie tells Naomi that her & Caleb haven’t kissed since their last make-out session in the rain, and that they agreed they wouldn’t do it again until he knew he was ready. Annie also tells her that they hang out in public to avoid temptation and have a date planned in the park today. While Annie & Caleb are on their date, they run into a nun that Caleb knows. Caleb tells Annie he has to make a decision. Caleb later goes over to Annie’s to apologize for putting her through his decision nightmare. After he talks about how Annie’s making him confused, he goes in to kiss her. Annie asks if he’s sure, and Austin says he’s not and he doesn’t care about the consequences. The two then kiss and we next see them in bed. Later, Austin comes by and asks Annie to talk to Ade for him and convince him he’s a good guy. Annie’s apprehensive and tells him that his can of worms includes her, and that she doesn’t want everyone to know she used to be a prostitute. She then heads to the staircase and sees Caleb. That, of course, means Caleb heard everything.
Seth is, by reputation, a jerkwad and a loser. He’s going nowhere, and the world might even be better off without him in it. But Seth is trying, and it is this single quality alone that made my heart pour out to him and root for him. He has no one to hold him accountable, no reason to try in school, and it seems like he has no reason to stop drinking all the time and wasting his life away. Yet Seth wants more, and it is from this launching point Freefall pulls the reader quickly into Seth’s world. He’s smart, but overtaken by untapped potential. He’s funny, attractive, and friendly. But he’s also someone who runs from his problems, lashes out, drowns himself in his misery, and seems to screw up everything he touches. Seth is flawed in ways he can't even see, and yet Scott has written him in a way that is sympathetic and understandable. When his entire background is taken into account, the road that’s led him to where he is makes sense. Even at his worst moments, there is still an endearing element to Seth and I completely empathized with this boy. The changes he makes are astounding, well paced, and perfectly build, making Seth a very three dimensional, raw character.

Throughout the book, Mann identifies variations of what he calls “Holmberg’s Mistake,” the idea that before Columbus the people of America had no history, living as subsistence hunter-gatherers in a landscape which they affected little, if at all. Holmberg, living with Amerinds in the 1940s, considered the people he encountered “living exemplars of primitive humankind.” In Holmberg’s words, they were the “quintessence” of “man in the raw state of nature.”
And along came mistake number two: he said, “I have no idea”.

While the number of patents issued in 2009 was off from previous years, a recently-published report from IFI Claims Patent Services suggests that 2010 made up for the difference, and then some. In fact, the USPTO issued an all-time high of 219,614 utility patents in 2010, up 31 percent from 2009, which would be the most significant annual increase on record.
So I'm trying to deal with him not talking to me.... it's harder than ever. I have been trying desperately to keep busy and keep my mind off of him and our situation.... but it seems everywhere I turn no matter what I do I'm reminded of him. When you're so close with someone that you share everything about your lives, how can you not think about them 24/7?? I see something I want to share and he's the first person I think of, I go to the store and I am reminded the last time I was there was with him, what we were doing, even what we bought.

WORT COPPERS - 'The largest wort copper is, in my opinion, too large for the boiling and proper cooking of delicate pale ales, and when I saw it boiling, the circulation was not good, and a good deal of foaming was taking place. This copper should not be used for wort boiling, but ought to be utilised for boiling the so-called pit water, and if a small tank were fitted up near present wort receivers and at same height, with pump to feed same from copper, you would then have a plentiful supply of safe washing water commanding Refrigerators, Hop-Backs.

The use of the passive voice is regarded as inferior and undesirable. Essentially, when it comes to academics that have to deal with the sometimes not-so-conformist or conventional ideas of their still creative students, the identification of the passive voice in a text gives them a reason to mark it down.
Then, because it was Japan in the 80s, and because there was a craze about small velvety anthropomorphic woodland creatures, the toys turned into a cartoon series. The first anime show was done by a completely separate company and called "Maple Town."

Back then, homebrewing enthusiasts who championed the practice accepted Trenton's imposing a permit requirement as a trade-off for getting it set down in writing that making up to 200 gallons of homebrew per year was legal. In short, it was the best deal to be had, as far as getting state lawmakers to say what the federal government had been saying, and thereby fending off any local code enforcement officers who wanted to act like a revenuers.
You might think that's just stupid and that I'm overreacting. Probably.

The petition for the issuance of a writ of possession and the present case, as heretofore stated, are oceans apart, so to speak. Thus, even if a writ of possession is issued, this will not prevent the plaintiff from exercising her right to redeem the property, if warranted. And it may be added that an indemnity bond is required to be posted in order that possession may then be obtained under a writ which may be applied for ex-parte, pursuant to Section 7 of Act 3135 as amended by Act 116.

Indeed, California lost a stunning $44 billion in tax revenue from the 869,000 taxpayers that left the state between 1992 and 2008. And that figure is probably too small. It only counts earnings for one year — the difference between paying state taxes one year and not paying them the next year, after the payer moved.

I’ve been thinking of lines and spaces lately. Every leafy tree invites me to see it two ways: once as an image of the multitude of greens and branches, then once again in negative, seeing only the jagged splotches of sky between branches and leaves.
Here’s one I wrote for the Read Write Poem community. It was later published in Ourboros Journal, and is one of my favorites. I used a talented poet’s line as an epigraph, a launch pad, although hers is very different and fabulous. (Please read Patricia Jabbeh Wesley’s poem, which is linked, below.)
In a double boiler set over hot water or a microwave oven on high power, melt the chocolate, stirring every 20 seconds. Remove it from the heat source and stir in the sour cream until uniform in color. Use it right away or store it in a tightly covered bowl. When ready to frost the cake, soften it if necessary in a water bath or microwave for a few seconds, stirring gently.

At some point in the past, a point lost forever to history, the McDonald's mission statement evolved from "sell rapidly prepared, inexpensive food" to "How much do you want to bet we can waste billions of dollars on annoying advertising that no one likes and still make money?" Nixon's mixed up in that somewhere, I'm sure.
Ten years had passed, but the words were still fresh in his head. “This world is dying”, a stranger once said. Day and night, they were always there, in the back of his mind, playing over and over like a record stuck in an infinite loop. Always playing, never changing, never fading, and always right. “This world is dying” His voice echoed once again, so sure of his words, almost like he knew… and that bothered Rel.
glass of wine as we had a bit of time to kill before dinner. We sat outside and listened as a rather posh, and tiddly, lady chatted with a friend; we learnt that she was cooking a roast at noon the next day and that she wanted to go to a party. The fact that she was already tiddly suggested that the roast might not happen, and this was only confirmed three hours later when we saw her very tiddly and throwing cocktails down her throat. Rather her than me!

After catching a glimpse of a modern cartoon it reminded of my childhood in the 90s and all the great cartoons there was on tv for example Hey Arnold! and Doug. This made me want to put my thinking hat on and do some Internet searching on 90s cartoons. During this Internet search I found some cartoons I’d never even heard but then I would come across gems like; Jonny Bravo, Cow & chicken, and The Ren & Stimpy Show.
In the light of those two prescient warnings, the market weakness we’ve experienced is understandable. The S&P 500 index is down more than 7.5% from its peak and the Nasdaq Composite has retraced more than 9%.
So when I heard a loud noise like something falling in the other room, I paused. Wouldn’t it be just my luck to go looking for what made the sound, all normal and happy, with no weapon, and that would be the time that someone really was lurking in a closet ready to jump out? Yes. It would be.

We bought the DVDs and literature on eBay (around $80). We bought a pull-up bar ($37) and a set of heavy-duty resistance bands ($70) on Amazon. We bought a yoga mat at Target ($10). We already had one yoga mat and a set of 15 lb. and 20 lb. dumbbells. Total cost was about $200, or 5 months of gym fees. Not exactly cheap, but we’ll never have to buy any of that stuff again.

I've been at this whole conscious/gentle parenting thing for a few years now, and I have heard just about every possible criticism of my parenting style from people who are convinced that more traditional methods are the way to go. Some of that criticism has been predictable and easy to deflect, like comments about bedtimes or educational choices. Other swipes have been harder to deal with, like spanking and forcing food choices. But of all of the comments I have received, the one that perplexes me the most is this one, Myth #2:

a) One thing that I look for is a girl with a bossy side. Anything she says that is a little sassy or bossy I will come back with a line like, “O wow a girl with a bossy side, huh?” Let her respond. Then go, “Nice I like bossy girls just not in certain situations.” She will ask you then what situations. A line that I follow up with is, “Just not in the bedroom they are typically the ones with the chains and the whips under their beds, and I try to stay away from those.”
Loved ones should work closely with the BP so that you can both better understand when the BP is talking for you. Read books on BPD together, encourage the BP to be as open as they are comfortable with about their feelings, without being pushy – they may need some time to process ‘why’ they are upset before they can explain it to you, so even if you can see they are upset but they say ‘I’m fine’ just remind them that when/if they are ready you will listen.

I'd seen My Morning Jacket once or twice, but last time I saw them, they were at a smaller stage at a festival and the crowd was really small. This time, there were TONS of people, a lot of them hardcore fans who had come and stayed through the past 2 shows just to get up close and see My Morning Jacket. We stayed at the front and listened to a couple songs. It was unbearably hot with all those people, and the music was so loud that I could feel it in my sternum, in my bones, blasting my ear drums even with ear plugs in. It felt like it was trying to redo my heartbeat to match the drums. Jon just lost it and freaked out. He was like, "Hey, I'm not okay, I'm gonna go." He turned around and bolted from the crowd, as fast as you can bolt through a tons of people packed in like cigarettes in a new pack.
Today, at noon, with the sun shining nicely on these sculptures, and silhoutted against the white snow, I could clearly make out what they were!! They looked just so awesome!! Well, okay, so maybe I'm easily impressed. But I thought I would show them to you, and see what you think. I tried to rotate the pic horizontally, to make it easier for you to see them, and it just seems to have set my whole world upside down! Rather than give any of you vertigo, I will leave it just as I see it from high above.

In the first part of this mini-series, I shared that with all sad things (like closing my dance studio) come great opportunities. It’s very true that something good comes from something bad or where one door closes, another opens. I’ve looked at this year as an opportunity to be away from running a busy business and taking the time, while I can, to better myself as a teacher for my students. I’ve already taken a great four day teacher training intensive with Ranya Renee up in Vancouver. She’s a wonderful Egyptian style belly dancer based in New York City. I have arranged plans to take a couple more belly dance intensives this year as well as attend my second Zumba Instructor Convention in Orlando. I can teach my Zumba classes without going of course, but it adds so much to my classes by learning more about different dance styles, energizing me about Zumba in general, and meeting other fellow instructors from around the world. This year, I’m VERY happy to say that I’m challenging myself and studying for the AFAA certification that is being held the day before the convention officially kicks off. AFAA is a group fitness certification, so it’s one of the best things I can do for my students. I’ll learn more about the body, how it works, nutrition, weight-loss, etc.
The other nice quality about Shortbread is that it goes perfectly with a cup a tea--which I've been drinking a lot lately due to my cold--and did you know this is "National Hot Tea Month!"

She wiggled around for comfort (rather too many crinkly sharp edges but not too bad if you get it… just so) and attempted to replay the sequence of events that were making her feel so unseasonably positive. Last night in particular had left her with a floaty feeling of happy nostalgia unswayed by the first fuzzy-minded knockings of incipient hangover and those all-too-familiar little ebbing waves of nausea that usually come with it, swiftly followed by a sickly acid taste at the back of her throat and, if she wasn’t careful, a spontaneous exercise in pavement painting, street art of the smelly kind.
This post is about that last one. Yesterday, while minding my own business, I decided to go running after work.
Until a few years ago, this very road was traveled by the santelena hotel venice italy in Italy are renting to people and as you reach Italy. For instance, if you were married in Italy is situated 50 miles from Florence, between Arezzo and Perugia. As you approach the santelena hotel venice italy of Genoa, Florence, Milan and especially Venice prospered, both in areas such as Sicily, were taken over first by Muslims in the santelena hotel venice italy a great deal of stunning mountain scenery?

Something realistic and well-defined. You're not going to wake up tomorrow, run 6 miles, and then do it again all week. Walk half a mile and make a homemade smoothie instead of a store bought sugar laden one. It all adds up.

John Constable, when he was working on his picture 'The Cornfield' moved to London to finish painting it. He had always painted 'from nature' but this was impossible in London, so he wrote to the botanist, Henry Philips, asking him for a list of the wild plants which would be growing in the area during July. And just listen to the list: 'all the tall grasses are in flower - bogrush, bulrush, teasel. The white bindweed hangs its flowers over the branches of the hedge; the wild carrot and the hemlock flower in banks of hedges. Cow parsley, water plantain and the rose-coloured persicaria in wet ditches is now very pretty. The catchfly graces the hedgerow and also ragged robin. Bramble is now in flower, poppy, mallow, thistle and nop. Goodness me - how many of these do we recognise now? Thanks to two things many of these have disappeared from our countryside. One of those things is undoubtedly modern farming methods but I believe the other to be our obsession with keeping our villages neat and tidy. Almost everywhere now has a Tidy Village Competition, and almost every village therefore has a tidying up day when offending 'weeds' are pulled up. Thank goodness these plants were still around in Constable's day and are still around in his paintings.
I FEAR: that something will happen to upset what is turning out to be a really kick-ass life.
But this morning I took the plunge. I shut off the hot water feed line and popped the top off the hot water faucet. I undid the screws and took off all the metal gaskets, but then I ran into trouble. The plastic plumbing underneath looked nothing like the picture of the brass "pressure faucet" in my Home Depot fix-everything book.
Upon leaving church, I headed off to pamper myself some more. I treated myself to lunch at Potbelly's and sat and read while waiting until it was time for my hair appointment. I don't know why anyone is afraid to eat alone. It's always interesting to people-watch or hang out and read a book. I only got o hang for about twenty minutes and then walked over to Identity to get my hair cut. My friend Chelsea has done my hair for years now, and I have never had a complaint. Granted there have been times it's taken me a little while to get used to my hair, but that's because I did something new; not because she did a bad job. So if you're in the market for a new stylist, I would highly recommend.

But I couldn’t resist the siren song of that book, so I made a tactical decision to use deep irony — to maintain an absolute deadpan. As nearly as I can recall, this is what I wrote:
We’re in that goddamn weird genomic white cylinder magic room or whatever and we’ve got fucking Inori offering Shu a cat’s cradle because LOL ~DEEP~ ~RICH~ ~COMPLEX~ ~SYMBOLIC~ ~SENTIMENTAL~ NARRATIVE BOOKENDING GUYS HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA I FUCKING HATE THIS SHOW. The cat’s cradles BARELY appear EVER, have nothing to do with the plot, and basically exist only for this. I could understand if the original use of it was done better, but that first time it was just kinda there. It’s fucking awful. I get that it’s meant to represent Shu’s character arc, going from a fucking awful wussy beta coward to just plain fucking awful, but it’s just hardly handled well at all. It’s just there, not integrated into anything at all really. Even if I’d enjoy the exact same thing in another show, right here, in Guilty Crown, with its atrocious writing, I can’t see it as anything other than a lazy attempt to have sort of symbolic overarching thing.

It has now come to light that Zuma has decided to write off some debt owed by his communist friends in Cuba. The gesture was applauded by the National Union of Mineworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), for reasons, among others, that the Cuban people under the leadership of Commandate Fidel Castro Ruz were with them in the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, and also with them in the military camps in Zambia, Tanzania and other parts of the world, while they were fighting the ‘evil’ apartheid regime. I also noticed that Cuba’s mythical victory at the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale was also repeated again and broadly published in the media today.

The Note to Self paper from Echo Park worked perfectly for this theme with that fabulous reel paper. Incidentally, I did take a little liberty with the sketch. My story is the reels are my horizontal element :) I used Black Licorice, Whip Cream, and Kraft cardstock. The Mini Scallop Edge Die-namics added an extra detail to the red vertical panel. The ticket strips were cut from the Note to Self paper. A few Fishtail Flags add another fun element (IMHO, the Fishtail Flags STAX Die-namics are a MUST HAVE - definitely!) Here is a shot of the inside with a few more stamps from this set and the great projector die cut.

Gay activists are protesting about a German zoo’s decision to split up a pair of male vultures. The zoo says they were being harassed by other vultures who took exception to their unconventional lifestyle. On balance, I think the zoo acted correctly. There is no defence against queer-bashing vultures – once those rowdy birds gang up with malign intent, the victims may as well fly to New Zealand. The heartbreak suffered by the separated couple could be eased by giving them an extra helping of offal for breakfast. Anyone who’s studied vultures knows that food comes before romance in their list of priorities.
Further, considering that we now have two Ozone holes, over the Artic and the Antarctic poles, there exists the unpleasant possibility the only natural weather humans will ever again see exists on other planets. The desire to possess the weather at all is illogical, so absurd there is no category in the system's verbose Diagnostic Manual to cover it, thus it walks free to smear its carnage upon defenseless twinkie addicts who refuse to pay attention and don't really care if there is anything else happening anywhere around them unless they are busted for one or more inane legal infractions and have to come up with bail. If they know anything, they know twinkies are not available on Big Ag's chain gangs.

These biscotti get pretty crunchy, so I’d definitely dunk them in your favorite coffee or hot chocolate (I think that’d be DELICIOUS). They also have a little chewiness to them from the banana. They really are delicious, and perfect for an afternoon snack, or impressing overnight guests. Homemade biscotti totally sounds impressive and yet it’s really not that hard to prepare.

It’s the age-old story … I followed my heart. I’d met a sweet, fun man who lived 5 time zones away, and having to book a flight to kiss gets old after awhile. So I took the plunge after I finished graduate school and moved to London where he was working. The man is long gone but I fell in love with London instantly, and very quickly felt like it was home. In 2006 I became a UK citizen so now I have two passports.

This article discusses the Lamb at Satwell, a former Brakspear’s pub in southern Oxfordshire. I vaguely recall popping in there for a pint in the early 80s, and finding a cheerful, down-to-earth atmosphere. Now, of course, it has fallen victim to the curse of the gastropub:

2. Cancelling/rescheduling appointments too often. Patients are understanding when a doctor needs to cancel or reschedule but not if it happens too often. This was highlighted in the recent trial of Dr. Conrad Murray, whose former patient testified that after two follow-up appointments were cancelled he felt that the doctor blew him off. The patient never followed up with Dr. Murray again.

You have to understand that when Michaela talks, her voice is loud and carries easily. As I was standing up, I heard the little, old lady who was tending the boutique say "Well, this isn't Walmart, honey." I looked at my daughter, and then back to the attendant and replied "obviously". Even though I wanted to explore a little more in this interesting store, I grabbed my daughter by the hand and felt it best to exit stage left.
In any event, on with the list. Now, keep in mind that I don't know what she wrote, but here are 12 things I love best about my wife:

Someday the 2nd generation of Felda settlers will change their mindset as even now some of them have already won lawsuits, for example RM11 million last year against the federal government. Perhaps a new way of thinking will dawn with the advent of the 3rd generation of Felda settlers although some say to form a new mindset takes at least 2 generations.
Place bricks of paraffin in a saucepan and place over low heat until completely melted. Meanwhile, fold the *diapers* (gathering the 3 points together) and secure with safely pins. When wax is melted, remove from heat and allow to cool a bit (it will still be melted but not quite as hot). Dip each diaper into the melted wax, shake off excess and set diaper onto a baking sheet, use your hands to shape into *cup* shape. Repeat with each. Allow to harden (this can be speeded up by putting them into the refrigerator for a few minutes). Once hardened, fill with nuts. Again, an extra cute thing is to tie the nuts in a round of tulle first.

I started wondering if maybe there was a site online that had some sort of interactive recipe cards that I could type the recipes into and then print out. Turns out there is. I found this website: Prints of Joy and they had exactly what I was looking for. Some cute recipe cards, too. I paid like $4.95 a piece for two different recipe card files that I was able to download. The files are completely interactive which means that I can change the size of the printable areas to coincide with whatever size card I want to print out. Then I can type up the recipe, save it to my computer and also print out a hard copy. I love it! And my recipe box is so nice and neat now.

We have a standing rule in the house that says “when mom is in the shower you don’t TOUCH or open the front door.” You would think this is a fairly obvious rule, but a few weeks ago we had an episode where the kids tried to invite some Jehovah’s Witnesses into the house while I was showering. Thank goodness I shower with the door open and the fan turned off so I can hear everything that goes on while I’m unavailable for 3 minutes a day. Thank goodness the JW’s had the sense to say “No thank you, we’ll come back when your mom isn’t in the shower.”

Mr. Boom's uncle died of a sudden massive heart attack Thursday morning. He was 55, and in seemingly good health. We're reeling. Two of his brothers (including Mr. Boom's father) aren't mentally able to make plans. His uncle is schizophrenic, and his father is deep in the midst of the mist of Alzheimer's disease. Another brother, whom I've never met, is supposedly coming to town. He's a couple of states and a lot of bad weather away. There's a sister, too. We don't know if she's been reached yet, or if she's coming. The sheriff of the last county she was known to be in is trying to track her down. It was another sheriff who reached the uncle a few states away. It was yet another sheriff who contacted the brother who lives in our town. We didn't know about it until a man we don't know called us up in the middle of the night to make sure we'd heard. We originally thought it was a joke. The local sheriff had asked the local uncle to contact us--we can't figure out why they thought that would work?

Some of my A-list breweries from California include: AleSmith, Anchor, Anderson Valley, Firestone Walker, Lost Abbey, Lagunitas, Sierra Nevada, and Stone. Beer trumps wine in two distinct ways – carbonation and at least four hearty ingredients: water, hops, yeast, and barley. I recommend that the next time you want to have grilled steak and are at the liquor store, peek in their beer section and grab an Pale Ale (like a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale) along with your Cabernet Sauvignon.

I couldn’t move for about three days. That’s what I get for skipping out on P90X exercises!!! I came to the conclusion that I won’t feel sorry for my body anymore. If I workout, I work out hard. Now that exams and studying are out of the way, and I sit on my ass in the office for 8 hours a day, I just have no right to be lazy!
Constantine was the first Christian Roman emperor who saw the symbol of Christ at the battle of the Milvian Bridge. Long before York was known as Jorvik to the Vikings’, Constantine would have known the city by its Roman name, Eboracum.

My bridesmaids Megan, Jessica, and Michelle ran a whole bunch of errands before the shower. While they were running errands, I decided to go to my parents' house early (to my parents surprise). When I drove up, I saw a silver Honda. My family doesn't own a silver Honda, and I didn't think my parents bought Brett and me a car as a bridal shower present. Then I saw the license late.... OHIO! My aunt and uncle, who we thought were NOT coming, decided to come! It really was the best present I got all day! I've realized more and more through this engagement process how important family is so having them there was the icing on the cake.
I have to say, and it pains me to do so, that generally speaking the guys really beat the girls in the style stakes here. The biggest campus trend amongst girls really baffles me and involves wearing a North Face fleece, yoga pants and Ugg boots. I even saw a girl yesterday wearing this combination with Ugg slippers. Backless slippers! In the freezing cold! This was the ultimate nail in the coffin where my British sensibilities are concerned. While on the one hand I like the idea of having a uniform, it's incredible how many people wear this head-to-toe go-to look. I saw four girls sitting together at dinner recently all wearing North Face fleeces, yoga pants and Uggs and it reminded me of The Ashley's from Recess and their matching outfits which acted like a code of membership to the friendship group. Of course not all of the girls dress like this, I'm just finding it interesting that there are very clear codes when it comes to dressing at college here and there is a lot of uniformity amongst students.

There you are, brother dear. I never felt being pushed strongly before. Yesterday/last night I was asking God if the ‘Don McLean and American Pie’ dreams which I had 2 times days ago, had any relevance to the time now. I was simply considering if I needed to post the dreams as comment on your article on this. Never did I imagine the confirmation to be this strong and urgent.”

I don't know about you but I have a hard time not just keeping my house clean but doing it for the right reasons. I need to have the right motivation for cleaning my house and I am hoping to find it as I go through this book. Every day there are Martha challenges that involve actual cleaning and then there are Mary challenges that challenge your way of thinking. I started this once before but had a hard time with the Mary challenges. Then I restarted it with the new Martha challenges that help with routine cleaning. I did well with that for quite awhile until summer came. I figure now is a great time to start again and this time I going to sign up with a group to hold myself accountable.

I think my love of reading came very early on. I am not an only child but I grew up as one... my brother was a lot older and had well and truly left home by the time I can remember... so reading was my hobby, my amusement and what I did when school was over and the play friends had gone home. There are many quiet moments in a house without siblings so it is easy for the characters of novels to become 'imaginary' friends. In my mind I shared in the escapades of Pollyanna, I hiked the mountains with Heidi and her grandfather in Switzerland and I was one of the Little Women... When you really immerse yourself in the words, especially as a child, the heroes and heroines are like friends, they become your family. The pages of my favourite novels were well thumbed, I was inclined to re-read the favourites over and over... I would feel sadness and loss when a great story ended... even now, I revert back to my first loves. Gone with the Wind, Doctor Zhivago, Anna Karenina... sometimes I even re-write endings in my imagination... University didn't change me much... I still read for pleasure as much as was possible and then when I married I chose someone with as great an admiration for books as me.
it started with deciding to use a book for a journal. I chose "Breaking Free" by Beth Moore. i had read and done the study with my small group many years ago. but as i was gluing pages together i began to read pieces of it and realized i wanted to read it again. i am in a different place in life/story. so i ordered it again.
Is it just me, or do you avoid taking a dump at work as much as you possibly can?
Let’s find some real information to do the talking and the data we have on oil’s causal effect on democracies and autocracies alike may be misleading (Haaber and Menaldo 2011). We need to make claims based on newer, bigger, badder, bolder and nacho cheesier data sets, which I’m sure is on the way(minus some of those adjectives). This information should be the first step in true transparency, in a world where one can feel comfortable about fourteen percent of its trade. Maybe with the correct information we can create policy that adjusts the approach institutions, democratic or not, take with oil. Could transparency in the international trade be the answer to removing the resource curse? I don’t see why it wouldn’t. Attempts at finding a way around the transparency issue are already starting to surface (Gelb and Mejerowicz 2011), but I would consider the suggestion in that paper to be nothing more than an unfeasible pipe dream. It still serves as a good example of people trying to find a solution to the problem.

UPDATE: 5th April, 2011. On the RTE Frontline programme last night the new Minister for Justice Equality and Defence Alan Shatter appeared on a panel to discuss this subject. The upshot is that legislation to allow downward reviews in Upward Only Rent Reviews (UORRs) will be presented to the Dail before the summer recess, or shortly afterwards and will be enacted “before the end of this year”. It is unclear if the legislation will be backdated, that is there may be a refund due to the tenant for historical rents and it is also unclear how market rents will be determined – the eligibility for using the new legislation and the arbitration process for examples – but it seemed clear from last night’s programme that tenants felt the present arbitration process was biased towards landlords.

Some of the younger Jesuits were cool; they were into the liberation theology version of Catholicism. They were the ones who got me interested in SNCC and nonviolent civil rights. But the older generation were pretty much universally from the medieval school of Catholicism. They might sneer at the know-nothing Franciscans but they would have gleefully participated in the Inquisition.
The first winner was # 16
Our morning started as we clambered off the 0530 a.m. train from Wuhan. Boarding the train at 2310 the night before meant that we had only a short 6 hour sleep cycle before beginning our day. This was less than ideal for any of us, especially since Rob and I were awake at least hourly throughout the night. The girls were far more cooperative with the readying and deboarding process than expected, largely because they were still asleep. We garbed them in coats and shoes, with a rare minimum of waking or fussing. This, in and of itself, seemed like a successful feat. With a small victory behind us, we threw our packs on our backs and set out down the road in search of one of the many hotels that should be lining the street. After a 10 minute walk, Rob sees a road sign indicating that Wudangshan is 20 km away. We quickly regrouped and reassessed, realizing, a bit too late, that we should not have been so hasty in waving on the multiple minibuses that stopped to offer us a ride. We now found ourselves on the side of the road, in a small unknown town, at 0600, attempting to flag down any bus heading toward the mountain. This is when a Chinese man about our age walks by, inquiring where we’re going. “Wudangshan,” we reply, thinking this is a rather obvious answer. “it’s just up the road,” he tells us. He is also headed to the mountain, and I note that he has a spring in his step while he carries only a light day pack on his back. Rob converses briefly with the gentleman, telling him about the road sign delineating the mountain’s 20 km distance. The man, assuredly confirms that the entrance gate is only 2 km from the train station. So we walk on, happy to know that the hotels can not be far off. I am more than ready to drop off our extra bags and grab breakfast before our excursion. Another 5 minutes down the dark road (few businesses are open and the single hotel we passed was locked) the Chinese gentleman asks one of the street sweepers about the mountain’s location. She tells him it’s 30 km up the road, he chuckles, and walks on. He obviously does not think Rob understood the overheard conversation. We walk a bit further, until we find an open hotel, and we stop to confirm directions ourselves. The Chinese gentleman is long gone by now. The hotel receptionist, who awoke from her slumber on the cot behind the front desk upon our arrival, helpfully directed us to the next intersection where the green buses stop that could then carry us into our destined city.
What happened? The spindled immediately jumped out of her hand and out the door. Amazed, she stood up and watched it as it danced merrily across the field, pulling along a glistening golden thread behind it. Before long it had disappeared from her eyes.

Since the chart was produced US home values have moved even lower. Japanese real estate values are going back to levels last seen in 1985. Two lost decades are baked in the cake. The US has already reached one lost decade. When you examine items like the above you have to ask what will be the impetus for increasing US home values. Are we seeing household wages go up? If you listen to talks of the great car recovery story, part of it had to with rising car sales but a large part of it had to do with slashing wages. How is that good for increasing home values?

And if it’s like this for me – and I can assume from your reaction that you know what I’m talking about – then I have to say that it’s even more so for what now, I’m afraid, I have no choice but to call “the younger generation.” Some of these folks have no memory of a time when you couldn’t get the idea to go out to a new place for dinner, look up your options, read a couple of reviews, get directions, and invite a bunch of your friends to join you there all within the span of a couple of minutes and all with a device you can hold in one hand. Whether we all want to recognize it or not, it is a different world today, and it’s getting differenter every minute.

A couple of years back I wrote this post about going over to Wales to visit my great aunt who had turned 100 on New Year's Day. She died today, aged 102. On the scale of tragic-things-that-can-happen-in-life a very old lady passing peacefully away does not rank too highly, but I found myself more upset than I imagined I would be when today inevitably came. I'd wanted to marry her when I was little. I understood marriage as being something you did with a lady who always beamed when they saw you and treated you with love and kindness. Throw in 'age-appropriate' and 'not a blood relative' and it's still pretty much a philosophy I subscribe to.

This fired Felicity up. Her confused and emotion-filled brain found something it could focus on: anger. ‘Adventurous spirit?’ she yelled, cheeks quickly reddening, ‘I think I’ve shown enough of that for one day! Can you understand what I have gone through? Can you truly understand the risks I have taken? The stresses I have gone through? The trust I have shown? All of it,’ she took a deep breath and continued in a gentler tone, looking in the man’s eyes and feeling her voice breaking from the rawness of the feeling, ‘all of it, for you?’

If you're like me and travel quite a bit and listen to a lot of music, you probably know that really small/compact portable speakers are a dicey affair. I've gone through at least 10 different makes/models over the last couple of years. They all promise big sound and lightweight, but in the end have all been pieces of crap. It's just nearly impossible to find something incredibly small that has worthwhile sound quality. If they sound decent, then they take up way too much space in my over-stuffed luggage or computer bag. And if they sound decent, they probably cost an arm, leg, kidney and unborn child.
All in all, I think crows are neat birds. I like hearing their “caws.” We had crows that would warn each other when a red-tailed hawk was in the area. To me, it looked like they were warning my squirrels. The squirrels knew what was going on and would hide-tail it up the nearest tree. Yep. My crows were looking out for the squirrels. What a great friend.

There is a special kind of awkwardness between two people who don't know each other well enough to interact effectively, but are familiar enough that ignoring each other's presence isn't really an option. No matter how much you like the person, you dread encountering them because you only know two things about each other and once you've covered those two things, there is nothing else and that is terrifying because you aren't good at ending conversations and that makes the horrible, strained silence all but inevitable.

Carradine is wonderfully awful as the would be kingpin who’s also really good at martial arts. He also has a personalized license plate that reads, I sh*t you not, “CARATE.” He’s making it with his ex-partner’s widow, Lola (Barbara Carrera), who’s the movie’s eye candy and leads to the best line of the movie.

It's amusing now to think back to the 1960s and early 1970s when there was so much talk about replacing teachers with televised learning, computers and programmed learning systems.

The feminist policies that were put in place to help women flourish outside the home have suffocated men’s opportunities for economic self-sufficiency. In short, men’s desire to be good workers and family providers has been undermined. This is more than unfortunate; it is a loss of catastrophic proportions, for it is men’s consistent, full-time, year-round work that women depend on in order to live that ever-coveted “balanced life.” What too many women don’t understand (because they’ve been unduly influenced by feminist groupthink) is that male nature is ultimately beneficial to them, for women continue to put family — not career — at the center of their lives and are thus dependent on men to pick up the slack at the office.
In about 1971, BHO returned to Hawaii to live with SAD and MD. At ten years old, SAD turned BHO over to CIA pedophile, rapist, and exhibitionist, bisexual sadomasochist Frank Marshall Davis (FMD)[89] for satanic ritualized sexual abuse and dissociated conditioning and programming (MPD). MPD conditioning is a regimen of physical and psychological beatings, rapes and sexual molestations that give birth to a cluster of alter personalities.[90]

But his first release for the new millennium, Mela, in which he acted alongside his real-life brother Faisal Khan, doomed at the box-office. While in 2001 he appeared in Lagaan. The film was a major critical and commercial success, and received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the 74th Academy Awards. Additionally, the film gathered critical acclaim at several international film festivals, in addition to winning many Indian awards, including the National Film Awards. Khan himself won his second Filmfare Best Actor Award. After four-years of break from acting, Khan made his comeback with Ketan Mehta’s The Rising in 2005, and later won a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance for his role in Rang De Basanti (2006). Later on he worked with Yash Raj film “Fannah” in which he played a negative role with Kajol as his love interest. In 2007, he made his directorial debut with Taare Zameen Par, for which he received a Filmfare Best Director Award. In 2008 Khan appeared in the movie Ghajini. The film was a major commercial success and became the highest grosser of the year while this year he will be seen again in Rajkumar Hirani’s 3 Idiots with Kareena Kapoor.
What is beauty? After my trip today I know what is it NOT. Real beauty has nothing to do with our bodies or what we look like on the outside, it just can’t be because I am the same person I was in the garden, except that now I don’t look the same, it is a dangerous thing to be swayed by something that looks pleasing on the outside. (and by the way it was NOT an apple, is just says fruit I do not know how this whole apple thing got started)
The show was fantastic.
My teenage daughter loves Pinterest just as much as I do. She confessed that she often visits the site when she's bored or slacking on school work.

Other boys joined them at Cecil House from time to time, boys of high rank whose parents saw the value in having their sons spend time in the Lord Treasurer's household where they formed a little academy. We must set aside our class prejudices about such a group, and not regard it as we might today, as nothing more than a sort of junior country club for upper class twits. Class division was part and parcel of the life of the times; these boys were looked to to bear the burden of governing the State in their mature years; for them, privilege was more than balanced by the pressures of grave responsibility.
Short aside: In David Sedaris's book, "Dress Your Family in Coudoroy and Denim" he talks about how his sister used to grunt while on the phone with him...and he always just assumed that she was opening up a jar of pickles or something...until she told him otherwise. He was scarred for life. Gross? Yes. Funny? Also yes. While I don't grunt on or off the phone, we thought this was funny and have decided that Joe is the only one who poops in our house; I open up jars of pickles. :)

On that picture we can clearly see what I meant earlier by the white part being see-through. The black tulle lace is very soft and matches the one at the bottom. It's different from the lace on the original JSK but it's not that obvious. The bows are made with grosgrain ribbon but they look a little twisted like they've been made in a hurry.
Lord Howe’s lagoon is protected by the world’s southern most coral reef. We took a turtle watching tour to the reef in a glass bottomed boat. It’s an amazing experience watching these giant creatures slowly moving through the ocean, while brilliantly coloured fish flit between the coral. The area is a protected Marine Park and home to 500 species of fish and 90 different forms of coral.

TL: ‘Escape’ has received the most attention - it's pivotal according to one reviewer. It has the most-quoted lines too. It was written years before I visited Egypt though (in 2001) and appeared in Seam. Don't know how many of the questions I'll be able to answer though.
Just about 2 more weeks left before I return to work and I have to admit that after Monday, right around 8:30 in the morning, I was positively longing for it. Mostly because there were people there that I could effectively communicate with. Most of the time, that is. And even if I did have to deal with cranky patients all day, surely that would be better than what I had just gone through.

It's not a coincidence that as I grow in confidence, something I never struggled with before I was 19, that that is the area I am the most attacked in. I lost my confidence in my journey, through many different circumstances and it started to come back slowly and in 2010 and when I shaved my head bald for my best friends family & daughter it was like receiving a gift of confidence that I forgot was mine all along. It is my true self to be confident and yet I have made many decisions that are the opposite of that. I made dreadful mistakes when I lost that confidence, when I lost my true self, and now I am firmly on the road to being who I was born to be and it's a great feeling.

Most people think that being girly means pink, means princess, means sweet and kind and nurturing and demure and ruffles and sparkles and playing house. Most people think that being boyish means blue and construction vehicles and being aggressive and physical and emotionless and tools and dinosaurs and being rough. And for some kids, that might be true - see my note about biological differences. But all girls and all boys cannot possibly fall into those boxes. The differences between individuals is VASTLY greater than the differences between genders. And trying to put all of the members of one gender into the same pink or blue box with limited options is stifling and damaging.
Now onto the cake! I wanted to bake something fun to celebrate and a confetti cake (also called funfetti cake) fits the bill. It has been on my list of things to bake for a while so I was happy to finally make it. I halved this white cake recipe and folded 2 tablespoons of rainbow sprinkles (the longer ones like these) into the batter. I baked it in a 10-inch pan so that I can cut smaller rounds out of the cake to make a mini layer cake.

Last night, my hackles were up. I have no idea why. I had such a great day of God sightings through my whole day. Willow Creek is going through a whole season of a Celebration of Hope. My heart was arguing with the songs. I don’t know why. So I began to pray and confess my reasoning. And God lead me to the verses that the song was based on. Micah 6:8.

Some things had just been taken as they were clearing out the boat. Nothing was mentioned at the time, but I found out later a few of Rob’s linen shirts had been kept by my g/f who had found Rob, a few other things that I later thought about and asked about had just been taken too. Sure made me wonder who my friends were. It’s not in my nature to be like that, to just take without asking and most definitely not when helping someone out at a time of tragedy – life lessens once again. It wasn’t the cost of the items, it was the principle.

We are such a fragmented body politic in this country that we are subjected to minority rule. What ever minority at the time makes the most noise seems to rule. It seems to me that the party in power, democratic, and the party of loyal dissent, republican are so at odds that they seem to take delight in simply negating the power of the other party without regard to the will of the citizens. I wish the voters of the U.S. would somehow come together and take back control of our country. I think it is important that the two parties work together to fashion legislation that reflects the will of the citizens instead of the will of the representatives.

SAPA is an important resource because according to SAPA’s statistics on sexul assault, 1 in 4 women and 1 in 33 men will become victims of some type of sexual aggression during their life time, and college-aged women are at the greatest risk. 20-25% of college women will become a victim during their college career.

The most profound usage of the olive tree in the Bible, however, is in relation to the Lord’s plan of redemption, and the Church. Romans 11:17-21 17 “If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.” Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but tremble. For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.”
There is nothing we can do to undo the past and all its sin and rejection. But we are called upon to claim the work of Jesus Christ and by faith inherit His life, eternal life. So when we believe on Him as Acts 16:31 commands, He forgives, forgets, justifies, sanctifies, regenerates, seals and so much more, all by grace through faith.
Natalie tries to bite Brenda, but Brenda manages to tape her mouth shut again, then stabs her in the side. Natalie cries out in pain, and Reese enters the room with her gun drawn before Brenda can do any more damage to Natalie. Reese unties one of Natalie's hands, then forces Brenda to stand against a window. Before she can finish frisking the killer, Brenda turns around and stabs Reese too. The two women struggle with each other, then Brenda gets the gun and shoots Reese.

The charges are as follows: one count each of “conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor” and 20 counts each of said misdemeanor. The conspiracy was, it would seem, a conspiracy to sit on the hallway floor in front of the US Bank lodged in the Memorial Union, allegedly obstructing said hallway. This was what the University went with. We know from the record that these charges were first chosen by the UC Davis police at the behest of the administration, and then forwarded to the District Attorney.

I already mentioned that I've been using these for a while, and they are the most incredible things ever! They aren't wet, like typical wipe removers, instead they have a dry/oil feel. They remove everything, including the most stubborn waterproof mascara, and leave zero mess behind. You're left with a clean and moisturized eye area. Honestly, they are like nothing you've ever used to remove your makeup. I was floored the first time I used them, and now they've become a staple in my kit. (an expensive staple)

And, if you were paying attention to the Collect, and how it relates to the Epistle, you will see that bishops, priests and deacons are placed in His Church to be stewards of the mysteries of Christ, in order to teach His people this very thing: To be ready to meet Him. The picture of John the Baptist is used by the Church to remind the messengers that we too must prepare the people for the coming of the Lord, for the day when He shall appear in glory, and we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

I had never grown potatoes before. I had never seen a potato plant. I knew that they grew underground and are delicious when pulverized and mixed with a fair amount of cream and butter (Mashed Potatoes), and that’s about it. I assumed, like nearly every other plant, you just chucked a seed into a hole, and boom… potatoes. So, when we went to pick out our seeds for our first garden, I was completely surprised when the associate at the garden center handed me… a bag of potatoes…

One wonderful lesson that I stumbled upon was "Glitter Germs," which I found posted on the blog titled, "Little Miss Kindergarten." I loved her activity so much that I had to try it out myself! So I emailed the author of the blog, Mrs. Coe, to find out a few more details of how to mix up her "Glitter Germs," because these details were not included in her post. She told me that she took some regular hand sanitizer and then purchased some make-up glitter at a beauty supply store. (I found mine at Sally's Beauty Supply for just one dollar!) Mrs. Coe told me that it is important to use the very fine make-up glitter because that way, if it gets into anyone's eyes, it shouldn't hurt. She simply mixed them together ahead of time. I only mixed a little bit in my hand at a time, though, adding a little bit of sanitizer and then dumping a little bit of glitter into the palm of my hand afterwards. I encourage you to also read Mrs. Coe's post to see how she did it, as I know that it was done in a slightly different way. In any case, here's the activity, the way I did it:
“However, this fatwa has nothing to do with the reality on the ground, and contains more political absurdity then it does religious guidance. Sheikh Al-Qaradhawi himself is an Egyptian who has Qatari citizenship – given to him after he opposed the peace agreement between Egypt and Israel. However, when an Israeli office was opened in Doha, Al-Qaradhawi did not renounce his Qatari nationality. This is a personal issue that does not concern us as much as we are concerned with the usage of religion, especially the weapon of the fatwa, in highly politicized cases.”

However, I usually do not feel a great urge to buy things on sight. I mull things over for awhile. Not so the other day when I got the Spring Nordstrom catalog. I came across these little cuties from Toms. Apparently Toms have come out with a collection of ballet flats, and this pair got to me. I could not wait for snail mail to bring them to me. I hopped in my car that day and zipped on over and bought them. I have yet to actually wear them. This happened just yesterday. But I do keep trying them on and imagine everything I can wear them with.

The video game industry is undergoing a major evolution. As gamers approach the end of the current generation’s cycle, there is much talk about what is to come. Gamers, developers, and analysts are all looking forward with optimism.

Listed below are five trends that we can only hope will not carry over to the next generation of gaming.

To hint at damaging information about the victim without revealing it is of course an old legal trick in the States, because it sets hares running in the prosecutor’s office. In this case, it will probably do that, because as the Slog previously revealed, there do seem to be a number of ‘facts’ about Diallo not entirely in keeping with the veiled-Muslim-goody-two-shoes image donated to her by the DA.

This conclusion is a neat blend of objectively provable fact, plausible hypothesis and projection of the characteristics of the person skilled in the art. Since the burden in civil proceedings is only on the balance of probabilities, inferences such as that drawn by the judge in this case are more than plausible: they are constitutive of fact.

I hope these simple tips will help many of you develop first person personas and encourage more participation in the first person interactions being offered at the C. Black coffeehouse. Remember, be yourself. The easiest way to create a historic persona, is to use as much of your real life as possible. Don't fall into the trap of assuming your first person persona has to be entirely different from who you are naturally. This just makes doing first person more difficult and creates unneeded stress, keeping you away from the fun of actually doing first person.

There was a big zombie crisis. Basically, there was red water and, I think, blue water. Or maybe it was bloody water. Whatever it was, it was highly infective. And it was all over the place. If you wanted to walk across a courtyard from building to building, and accidentally stepped in a red puddle, such that a drop of it hit your skin — you would be taken over with zombie-rage in a matter of seconds. There might have been a video game aspect to this dream, because I think I was infected MANY times. So that would imply that I kept respawning.

Plus, it just gives me an opportunity to do something different & out of the ordinary (for me anyway), as I usually stick to Reinheinsgebot brewing.

Mondo and I are delighted that so many of you have made it across to listen in live, but appreciate that a rigid radio time slot (with no 'listen again' facility as yet) is not as convenient to everyone as podcasting. So we are attempting to make our own recordings of the live shows, to continue with the podcasting option for those who can't tune in live.

I think that's all for now folks! I should have a couple of birthday presents to share in the next few days plus my ATCs for my swop with Kerry. You may also have noticed that I have failed to make a biscornu for my monthly biscornu challenge for April! Oh dear! I'll have to make two this month to make up for it!! I'm sure that'll be no hardship!!

That’s when the brouhaha started. The manager eventually joined the conversation and raised her concern about the poster, but because she failed to deal with the situation directly, she damaged team dynamics instead of coaching a new employee.

I cannot recall a more sickening item online than the relentless mainstream media link to a frame-by-frame video of Qaddafi's sodomization. It was up for days, I refused the invite, holding back my revulsion simply from the vision as puke rose in the esophagus and wondered who in their right mind would click to view it. Is this what entertains my brothers and sisters now? Who among you salivates at seeing the sword draw blood from the anus of another person? My God! After what the human race has done to this man, even if it was his double, the unmarked grave, the total lack of celebration of a life, the pro-lifers in the candidate's seat swearing life begins at conception, utterly lacking in compassion for lives currently in existence as if every man and woman other than the speaker is an immediate threat. And as if that wasn't enough, hour by hour every single day, the crime on the ground fully emulates the enuring of our species. No matter where you are, lock down your life, danger lurks. Seal yourself from the others, their intention is always evil. You would think serial killing home invaders are calling the shots and for all we know, that could well be the case. Actually, I can't think of a better description of bigshots busying themselves dreaming of newer and ever-slimier activities.
Before he reached his teens, he was driving herds of mustangs in the dead of winter across miles of snow-covered wilderness to a ranch owned by his mentor, rodeo cowboy Gerald Roberts. At 14 he won his first prize money ($85.50) as a saddle bronc rider in McLaughlin, S.D.

“We will burn more calories when we engage the larger muscles of the body, so deepening our warrior poses, yoga squats and chair poses will increase the demand on our large muscles, therefore burning more calories.” So, for example, in our class this week at Yoga With Nicci, as we moved through Chandra Namaskar (Moon Salutation), with many squats, Trikonasana etc, you would definitely have been working into the larger muscles of the body, through a flowing sequence of asanas.

In a recent debate I was told that Jesus never said, “I am God worship me”. At that time I did not answer with the above verses but now I think I should have. The reason is that in these verses Jesus proclaims his divinity and that all people will worship him.
I have decided from the onset that you will be tormented forever in an invention I created called “hell” if you disobey me and if you don’t believe. I cannot change the cruel rules and heartless punishment that I made so your ONLY escape is to save your own self by believing in a man who claimed to be my son, who I murdered so that you no longer have to face MY harsh penalties.
DOES THE PRIVATE life of a leader truly impact his or her public life? No question about it! How you deal with the circumstances of life tells the world many things about your character. Crisis doesn’t necessarily make character, but it certainly REVEALS IT! Adversity makes a person choose one of two paths…character or compromise. Every time a leader chooses character he grows stronger. LIkewise, every time a leader chooses compromise he grows weaker.
I love the tears of a warrior though. They tell of a depth from which his passion receives its nourishment. Did not our Lord cry? Yes he did, and for that I am very thankful. In fact, a Christian who can not or will not cry frightens me. Life is too beautiful and too tragic not to rend the softened heart and to wring the tears from the eyes of the saints. A sunrise in its beauty and a genocide in its ugliness are both a part of what makes a man a warrior. The genocide tells him that things are not all well and that something must be done, the sunrise tells him that things are not all evil and that something good is being done. The genocide is his impetus and the sunrise is his strength.

On the way down, probably dropping 1,000 vertical feet per hour, the temperature was rising again. There was a waterfall off the beaten path but I found a little trail that took me over to it and what a treat that was. I stood at the bottom of the fall and let the water splash my legs. It was just beautiful.

He somehow reminded me of another pigeon who regularly visited our balcony for a few minutes. We called him Mr. Whitecap, because he was light grey, with white wing feathers and a white cap. And he had one badly crippled foot that made him limp. But nevertheless he appeared again and again for about 5 years and then disappeared. I respected and admired this bird for coping with this injury and apparently having a strong will to survive. How little did I know then…

Jesus reaches up but not far enough, and he falls. His hands and his arms and his body detach from the scaffold and out he goes, into the air, clear space all around him. Lazarus swipes at his clothes and clings on, hauls him up and over and onto the safe flat roof. It is an impossible achievement, an unbelievable rescue.
What inspires me are the curves, the arches, the twinkling glass and gold leaf pieces in the mosaic inlays. And the lights in the floor are an unusual and dramatic sight.

That particular television advertisement is aired in the 12-2am time slot, in addition to those featuring a myriad of other young women(only women), and it would appear Australian commercial television stations have no ethical or legal obligation to provide advertising that is not sexually exploitative, discriminatory or demeaning. If they do, then scrutiny of such content is not a priority for Australian media watchdogs.

After acquiring the small gem, the Royal Family had the Baroque palace extended at the back in the 1840s. This was done in the neo-gothic style and by taking Christ Church College in Oxford as an example. Unfortunately, the extensions were not constructed as well as Christ Church College: within less than 50 years, they had to be pulled down. The only part left standing was the large hall, which is now called the Gothic Hall.

To Bloom One Day is a wonderful conclusion to this series. No strange events such as Enishi suddenly becoming very competent at his job and running the inn occur. It’s a very melancholic end, yet we see hope that everyone will come back together one day in the future. The mirror setting of Ohana on the streets of Tokyo is very well-crafted. I was heavily depressed when this episode aired last year and it still makes me feel sad when I re-watch it. It’s a pleasant ending to this series.

Mechanique: A Tale of the Circus Tresaulti is Genevieve Valentine's just released debut novel. It is quite an original piece of fiction and once I found my footing in the world I carried away with the circus . I'm nearly done with it and although it is short I can't bring myself to finish it as this is a world unlike any others. The style challenges the reader like few do as it is at once both beautiful, mystifying, and horrifying. I'll hold most of my thoughts until my final review, but if you couldn't tell I think quite highly of Valentine's work. The closest comparison I can think of is Jeff VanderMeer's Ambergris books as Mechanique is a very fractured story jumping around in time and also perspective.
Driving in Cleveland is a unique experience regardless of which side of town you are in. Since the terrain is less hilly, the streets on the West Side are a little more inclined to be in straight lines with only 4 streets coming to an intersection, but the driving on the East Side is an experience everyone should get to have at least once in their lives.

He wants each of us to turn from our sinful ways and to turn one hundred percent toward Him. He longs for us to seek after His heart, for He longs to prosper us in ways that we cannot imagine. He longs to give us hope and a future. Unfortunately, too many of us look toward ourselves for the hope of the future and we look to God as our “parachute,” our safety net.

It has been highly publicized that mercury is found in dangerous quantities in seafood, such as tuna, swordfish and tilefish. This creates a rather ironic situation: Instead of making you smarter because of all the Omega-3 they contain, the fish produce exactly the opposite effect on the brain due to mercury poisonning.
Similar scenarios play out for women all over America, and even in other parts of the world.

Overall, progress is forward. I think I'd like to start doing some clicker training with her, starting with the idea of "whoa" for whenever she feels like she needs to leave. The most important thing right now is that I solidify our friendship in her mind. I want her to see my coming as something good, and know that she can trust me. Considering that shortly ago she was completely uncatchable, I think we're making good progress in that way.

That was not always the case. The old, communist left, was certainly not anti-statist, as it had “good” statist models: the Soviet Union, Communist China and Cuba. However, as Asaf Sagiv argues, with the disappearance of these positive models, the left had nothing tangible to offer. In fact, this process was gathering steam since the 1950s, when the crimes of Stalin became publicly known. Having been disillusioned from communism, but still resentful of the capitalist west, the left increasingly espoused the model of “resistance” to the current order (thus the all too common alliance between radical leftists and Islamists, yet another fascinating phenomenon). The absence of a positive communist model, and the resistance to the capitalist state, had left the activists with no agent to implement their costly dreams and projects. At times, that leads to senseless fury and violence, as in Greece. But in other cases, such as the Occupy Wall street movement in the United States, the activists, without disavowing their anti-establishment posture, do expect the same establishment to fund their pet projects.
I am not a PC supporter. I never have been. When Redford was chosen as PC leader last fall, though, I decided not to make an immediate judgment about her. Since she was our first female premier, I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. I waited. I watched. I listened. For months.
The tavern fell quiet. Several men got to their feet but only one made a move, a dagger in his hand, rushing towards Lord Fuckington. The Lord drew his sword and thrust it into his belly. He sank forward, further along the blade, grunting. Looking him right in the eye Lord Fuckington twisted the sword, causing him to howl out in agony. He pushed him backwards and his body crumpled. Fuckington turned to address the room.
Thanks for reading friends.
Final thoughts: This book was just okay for me, even though when I started it, I was bound and determined to LOVE it. It simply wasn't what I was expecting and I think that may have gotten in the way a little. Also, I read the NetGalley version, and there was a TON, I mean a TON, of formatting issues that made it extremely hard to keep up with what was going on. I would recommend it to those who like murder mysteries and quirky, opinionated heroines.
Certainly, it is useful to debate these issues, to make sure that multiculturalism does not degenerate into islands of separate communities or a country bound together only by its diversity. And that means for a country like Canada a significant investment in civil society. It means state support for those diverse organizations that speak for the otherwise invisible, the marginalised and vulnerable, organizations like Egale, or the AFN and Elizabeth Fry and John Howard and the Civil Liberties Association. It means support for local, national and international non-governmental organizations to do what government cannot do as well. It also means encouraging new types of association that can push and prod government and hold it to account, associations that cut across our differences based on democratic values, human rights and a commitment to mutual aid and the peaceful resolution of conflict, associations that do not impose a single version of what it means to be Canadian but bring us together to hash out our best understanding of the common good and how to pursue it, associations that serve not as a substitute for the state but as necessary ingredients to revitalising our democracy and our citizenship.

Today’s Simply Solo Spotlight is written by Eva, a longtime reader of Simply Solo. Eva first emailed me a gazillion years ago (okay last September when I was Freshly Pressed), to tell me that while she is kind of a prude about sharing her feelings in public, she wanted to tell me via email that she really enjoyed my blog. It was the kind of email that reminds you why you spend hours writing and managing a blog. Well, Eva got back in touch with me a few weeks ago, because she wanted to share her story with my readers. I love her tale, and I love her strength in sharing it with us. I hope you enjoy today’s guest post.

While I’ll always be a Jersey Fresh girl, I headed up to Connecticut last week to visit my friends Alex Gross and Zach Gross who have worked at Riverbank Farm for several years now. Alex (visit her fab food blog here!) graduated from Fairfield in 2009 and is now one of the managers on the farm and Zach is starting his senior year at Fairfield and has just gotten back from a semester abroad in Nicaragua and a summer internship in Mexico.. talk about power siblings! I joined them for a morning of tomato harvesting and had such a wonderful time learning the names of the different varieties and catching up with Alex and Zach. Riverbank is located in northwestern Connecticut and between three greenhouses and over 12 acres, they grow wonderful organic produce and flowers to sell wholesale and at market. I met some really wonderful people and got to spend some time chopping up tomatoes for sauce to be canned.. I looked like a hot mess after a few hours but was so glad to have been a part of the day.
I had a few ideas in my head for months before I finally worked out an outline for the story and got down to writing it. From finishing the first draft to publication was about three years.

Embedded systems evolved with general-purpose computer systems. They were at the forefront of the use and justification of computer products, the closest to the field. This is where the theories are making or breaking. In the past, most of the embedded research and development was identified with real-time systems and industrial settings, but things have been changing since. With wider deployment of computers, the need for embedded systems has increased. We can recognize this in almost any facet of our lives: embedded systems are in most house appliances, cars, electrical devices, and industrial devices and tools. This seems to be a long-lasting trend in front of us, of the same or larger impact and disruption than the appearance of the Web. Being widespread poses some hard requirements on embedded systems. They must be as reliable and robust as other house appliances; as easy to use and as available; connected with other devices, requiring adherence to standards of some kind; and low cost—consequently their development will be defined on a strictly economical basis.

The bath tub won't drain, the sink is leaking and the toilet won't flush, sound like every one's worst nightmare right? We all know the home repair projects that can wait, but what about the one's that can't? Plumbing is nothing to let go. I've played that game before and I realized things only cost more money when you don't keep up on your home maintenance. Face it we all hate to call a professional in to do projects, but sometimes it just can't be helped. Temecula plumbing can help you in any situation. My bath tub wasn't draining and of course we plunged and plunged till finally the water just sat there. We were actually bailing some of the water out every time we wanted to take a shower. Talk about desperate! We waited so long to get the drain professionally unclogged that of course when we had a done we experienced a broken pipe. Yet another cost I really didn't want.

This giving up of self is what causes all the suffering. It causes us to be depressed. It causes us to be anxious and panic. It causes us to seek all manner of self-defeating distraction. It even causes us to hear voices and see visions generated by our own thoughts boomeranging back to us as hallucinations because we have denied them an audience in our conscience minds. They’re too threatening, so we disown them, and then they own us.

These verses do give a broad outline–perhaps a 19th century view–of the Christian life. Certainly they hit the highlights of Jesus’ life. But when we hear the Savior calling, what does it mean? What does it mean to me? What is my calling? Where is the Savior calling me?

After you formed yourself to be the best in your true identity you then learned how to form your family life to be powerful as well. After you learned how to form your family life to be healthy and powerful its time to dig into a source that actually takes care of your family. Business. What is business? I’m not asking the definition of word business just the meaning of it. What does business mean to you? Do you understand the life cycle and why there is such a thing as business? There is an element that I call “Law of Survival.” In order for every human to survive and live in this life one has to provide some kind of service or benefit to another human being in order to get pieces of paper called money. Who ever has money can get things. Who ever does not, can not. Sounds fair to me. This life cycle was created so that there would be fairness in this world. Imagine a world of needy humans trying to get everything for themselves unearned. I simply can not. Now enough about the meaning of law of survival. Lets actually talk about business. Have you ever dreamed or wished to be operating your own business or to be an investor? If not then you probably have very low limitations to your life and your family’s life. If you are in the process of building your goal in business by working for an hourly rate ( to save some money maybe) there is nothing wrong with that. That’s the first step anyway. You’re on the right track. But if you want to work for someone for the rest of your life then your limitations are very low and I personally would never achieve things that I can by working for someone else for the rest of my life. You have to understand that becoming a business person takes away all your fear which is a poison for your inner spirit. It isn’t easy to become a business person or an investor. There’s a lot of risk and fear involved that might try to get you. But if you really want to overcome the greatest poison in life called fear then start making plans for owning a little business. Provide some kind of service that benefits other people. Market yourself and your company, build your own client base. Not only you will create jobs but also you will take care of your family on much higher level then they are at now. One other feeling that drives me to own my own business is simply because I love the feeling of success. You have to learn how to remember that owning a business is crucial for overcoming fear, taking care of your family and influencing your success to other people who will learn from you and become successful as well.
Look at Apostle Paul because of God’s super abounding Grace in him – there is opportunity for God’s power to rest there. It simply needs to be called forth.
Yesterday, I gave you a copy of Joan Didion’s “On Self-Respect,” your mock exam scores, five or six pages of feedback on that exam, and a deconstructed student rhetorical analysis response. I’ve now shared with you a few more things:
I say this loving Dakota but she looks unable to rock --she's no Carmen Sternwood, she's not even the rather alarmingly focused creature belting out an a capella "Hound Dog" in the 2007 movie of that name (my review here). There are 16 year-olds out there who are going on 23 and there are 16 year-olds out there going on 11. Dakota was an 11 year-old going on 30 but now she seems to have inversed that arc, while Cherie was clearly still 'advancing' to an alarming degree. Maybe the studio hoped Fanning would mature during the filming, for certain she's due to pop into womanhood any day... if she lets it happen. There are ways that girls can prevent it, and I shudder to think that Dakota's following in so many young girls' DSM IV-certified child actor anorexic stunted growth footsteps. In THE RUNAWAYS Dakota's still just a deer in the headlights, not yet a she-wolf eating said deer. Fanning lets Kristen Stewart do all the heavy lifting while she lies in the corner, sucks her thumb, and acts coy. Is she even having fun? Does she still like to pull the wings off flies? Are you getting all these super-droll BIG SLEEP references?

New Jersey has the New Jersey Statutes Annotated or NJSA and the New Jersey Administrative Code or NJAC. The first is the actual laws passed by the legislature. The latter is the set of laws and rules which implement the laws of NJSA. Thus, when we talk about civil service, the pertaining title in NJSA is 11A and the corresponding title in NJAC is 4A. NJAC4A enforces NJSA11A.
First of all, don’t be afraid to dress in what you like just because everyone else around you dresses differently. To me, I see it as everyone else dresses so boring, like cookie cutters, and meanwhile, I dress fabulous, and stand out from the crowd in an amazing and unique way! You have to look at your situation in the same way. I have never gotten so many compliments on my outfits, hair, and makeup as when I have been dressing in a retro style. I have people nearly every day complimenting me, and I always get noticed on the streets or in the subway. It makes me feel good knowing that people are appreciating my efforts and the ways that I love! Naturally, there are going to be some people who think it is weird not to dress like everyone else, but think about it – they have been brain washed by all of the popular magazines and shows, and think that’s being unique. But we are truly being unique and really being ourselves and being who we want to be. We are living life our way, and damn proud of it!

I look care to paint the top inch of the inside of the bin because, in time, it's my intention to give the bin contents but at the moment I'm just pleased I managed to find one that did the job so well.
So, 17 seasons on from lifting a Premier League title, a cloud of concern, uncertainty and despair looms over Ewood Park. One thing is clear though: change is needed.

I was going to post a picture of my ring, but I think I’ll wait. I absolutely love it. It’s gorgeous. But, today we took it to get resized and unfortunately, my fingers are so small they don’t even stock the ring size in the country. It will need to be specially made and could take up to 6 weeks. I’m pretty gutted that I won’t get to flash it to everyone just yet, but I’m sure I will make up for it when it arrives!
I appreciated Megan Casserly’s thoughts as much as I liked Hanna Rosin’s piece in The Atlantic in 2010 on the same topic. I don’t think men are ending any more than women are being created by their modest economic and educational gains. The”mancession”, the masculinity crisis and other ways of saying that men have been allowed to be boys for longer than women were allowed to delay maturity intrigue me because they have all become part of the animosity leveled at unmarried women. It’s not true that the more successful women become the less men know how to be men, but it is true that patriarchy demands that white men are breadwinners with women and children as dependents. So the idea that more and more men at the top of that hierarchy are struggling financially and falling into dependent roles (once reserved for women) demands thorough and continuous investigation. I believe in there, somewhere, is one of the reasons that people have become so fixated on single women and making them feel bad for their success.

This morning I compliment Riley's teacher on her cute outfit. She was dressier than usual but super cute. She laughs and says "ah thanks. I was out of town this weekend and didn't get the laundry done" I so get that. I love these little reminders that most moms are in the same boat. We are all running around trying to get it all done and sometimes we make it and sometimes we stumble. Cell phones have been outlawed while driving. I am much more distracted thinking about my to do list as I drive to work. Talking on the phone is the much easier than balancing the checkbook, scheduling a drs apointment, writing the grocery list and scheduling the days activities.
Rape you
Make the proposal efficient: Tell her over the phone that you have a very important question to ask her, a question that you need to ask in person, a question that will change both your relationship with her and your lives together, but tell her you can only ask it after she has finished cleaning both your house, sharpened the blades on the lawnmower and picked up your dry-cleaning.

Primo says I was poor when I was a kid, but I disagree. We lived just fine, but just didn't have luxuries, like going out to eat. His parents had the money to pay for his college. He worked, but he worked for beer money.
As Mr Blair was preparing to send British troops to Iraq, he also had more mundane domestic concerns on his mind. In March 2003, a new kitchen was fitted in his constituency home in Trimdon Colliery, Co Durham, at a cost to the taxpayer of £6,500.
I couldn't have a better dinner, but the restaurant attached to the hotel is a Mexican restaurant, and I was advised by a Delta employee that the hotel is nice, but the restaurant isn't as nice. So I got things I could carry cold and get to the hotel before the other bounced passengers beat me to it. The vouchers cover a room so thoroughly that they didn't even ask to see my ID, nor for a charge card.
BUZZZZZZZZZZZZ.
Halloween came and went rather quickly, and my major mom FAIL of the week was not getting pictures of Anna in her costume. Then again, she went as the Super Hero Girl (her birthday costume), so it’s not like I don’t have any pictures of her in this garb. I just feel so bad! I had my camera with me and everything, but the card was not in it. DOH!
The flat-footed beetle illustrated is 25 million years old. These insects, which have undergone no changes over 25 million years, expose the claims of evolution about natural history to be falsehoods. The fact revealed by the fossil record is that God created these beetles, like all other creatures.
I want to tell you a little bit about the Raku process as I am practicing it. First of all, Raku is an old Japanese technique that is very different from the newer Western technique that we call Raku today. You can read about both Raku techniques in detail on Wikipedia.

‘Like this?’ I asked, placing the balls of my feet against opposite sides of his hard shaft, wrapping my toes around, and gently starting to press my feet together and move up and down. We played like this for some time, his fingers on my breasts and in my mouth – tasting enticingly of my own musky juices – as I shifted into different angles and distances to try get a firmer grip, and occasionally paused to softly run my toes over his balls, his ass, and through his pubic hair.

In Beaver Valley, Dad had 588 acres of land, but not all cleared. That’s a lot of property! The hay meadow was about a mile from the house…. Too far for my dad and brothers to come home for lunch!
I posted this last year on my Tumblr blog, but since I am still obsessed with this playlist, and since I just discovered 8tracks, I figured I would repost it, share it with my new wordpress followers, and this time include the actual playlist! This playlist has never let me down. It’s a keeper.
Nevertheless, Boehner pledged on Sunday to move forward with a his proposal regardless of Democratic opposition. “The preferable path would be a bipartisan plan that involves all the leaders, but it is too early to decide whether that’s possible,” he said in an appearance on “Fox News Sunday.” “If that’s not possible, I and my Republican colleagues in the House are prepared to move on our own.”

It is interesting to compare Brueghel II the Younger’s style with Rubens’ style. I always thought of Brueghel as coming before Rubens, but they were in fact contemporaries. I suppose that Brueghel the Younger was ridding the wave of success created by his father, Brueghel the Elder, and carried on painting in the style of the former generation.
Ahhhh, what a fabulous excuse to get out all of my pink glass for a play. I had forgotten all about this beautiful colour, Reichenbach Mystic Pink. Yum! I used the goldstone cored twistie from the Kiss Me Quick collection and Sweetheart murrini to make these sweet little beads.

"What are you doing, Ilena?" I asked the little girl lumping chunks of clay in a mound around her. It reached up to her waist.
I have, in an attempt to remain holy, refrained from expressing my personal views on this matter, but recent events and conversations have made it all the more important for me to speak up. A few things about me that don’t matter to God: I’m a bleeding heart social liberal. Plain and simple. I like universal health care; I like equal pay for women; I like freedom and civil liberties; and when it’s all over: I LOVE GOD. So no, not all socialist, liberal types are heathens or pantheistic or “spiritual.” I’m a follower of Christ and I embrace it, I love it and I live it.
Yes, I'm going to offend someone, maybe lots of someones. There are an amazing number of people out there who cannot laugh at themselves or others. My aim is not to offend, but rather to offer a lilypad through the mud of human relationships.

When you check out her blog be sure to also check out her home tour. Everything is so fun and bright, I wouldn't be able to walk into a room without smiling.

Off the plane and out of the airport in record time, within an hour I'm meeting Mr & Mrs Snake at Rosamunde's in the Mission. If you've been to Toronado, chances are you've eaten sausage from the shop next door. That's the original shop. This place wasn't here last time I visited, but it's a fusion of both things, beer and sausage, and I wanted to see it.

Ego: The Fall of the Twin Towers and the Rise of an Enlightened Humanity by Peter Baumann and Michael W. Taft is the first book to explore the positive evolutionary potential hidden in one of the most destructive events in history. In their examination of the evolutionary implications of 9/11 and its aftermath, the authors contend we are not falling into the grip of a new dark age at all, rather we are on the verge of a much brighter one as the Darwinian process of natural selection continues to advance humankind.
It doesn't matter if your friends tell you that he wasn't good enough for you or that you can do better, because when you break up, you don't think you can do better than him.

After the Global Financial Crisis in 2007 (the GFC), the Tasmanian Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) changed its policy on the creation of permanent positions. The Department now offers only fixed-term contracts to cover staffing needs. These fixed-term contracts were renewed between 2007-2009/2010. There was a general understanding that these would continue to be rolled over come the end of the often one year term, and employees felt reasonably secure. The State Government pledged to retain all ‘staff in front-line healthcare positions’ and find other areas to effect staffing cuts. Many friends of mine employed in departments across the public service found themselves with ending fixed-term contracts with no prospect of renewal. Nurses, doctors and other healthcare workers survived the cull and morale went unchanged. The potential dangers went unrealised and when the GFC seemed to ‘blow over’ those dangers were pushed aside.
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. 2 And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

We had fires in the woods with friends and woke in the mornings to take our wares to sell in town or just to wander about like tourists, drinking coffee and looking at cathedrals.
I liked the movie, although I was really judging the idiot parents that were in the movie theater with children under 10, and actually if I have a say, and I think I do since I’m a parent of an 8 y/o, don’t think I’d want my kiddo reading these books until perhaps 12-13. But that’s a whole other topic, so why a couple families brought, their 5, 7 and toddlers is beyond me.
Things came to a head when we attempted to attack a boat full of tourists that we'd come across on our circular travels. Bearspit informed us that not only had we run out of food, but we had run out of stuff that vaguely resembled food and so the time had come for some piracy. He made it sound so casual. The crew armed themselves with the swords that Moonfaced Austin had made from discarded rope while I desperately racked my brains for a means of escape. We caught up with our prey as they headed in to port and, as the tourists happily snapped away with their cameras, Captain Bearspit and the crew of the Flimsy Floozy attempted to board the targeted vessel. One by one they jumped, missed the deck, and plunged into the sea. As the people on the sight-seeing cruise clapped and cheered, the captain of that boat made a call to shore and informed the coast guard. Within an hour, we were all picked up and taken to the nearest police station. When our day in court came, a series of thunderous outbursts from our brave leader (including "SEND US TO PRISON IF YOU MUST, BUT WE ARE ALL PIRATES AND WE WILL NEVER STOP PIRATING!") led to us being convicted of Attempted Piracy and we were each sentenced to 5 years detention in HMP Southampton.

The Lord caused my path to intersect with Karen Burkett’s not once but twice. For the second time round, I do freelance writing and editing for her online company (http://www.christianeditingservices.com). How we connected – and then reconnected – is a story in itself. Suffice it to say the first time was because I subscribed to an online newsletter for Christian writers and the second was because my name was right after one of her client’s in her dropdown address menu.
Some real gems in this one.
and I only experienced mild symptoms - no need for an er trip.
so there you go, do pop along to sandras blog and join in the fun.i was doubting my card i posted earlier but looking at this i can really see that i have improved and i should stop being so hard on myself.see you in the morning.
when i first met my husband 8 years ago, i was working as a medical social worker on an infectious disease unit at a large hospital. i was meeting patients who were learning of their HIV positive status for the first time, running support groups, connecting them with resources, agencies, medications. it was a very intense job, and i loved it. but even with the joy that came with the idea of being in a helping profession, it still weighed heavy on my heart. i was learning in that year in particular how to set boundaries, to leave work on time, and to leave the anxiety, the questions, and the heartbreak at the job. in the midst of all of that learning, i met john. as we fell in love, my heart and my mind were consumed with the potential and the possibility of our relationship, and i was released of the burdens i was holding close. i have very clear memories of walking the halls of that hospital, responding to the latest emergency, but not having that feeling of dread, but instead having the feeling of "i have found love and all of this doesn't feel so heavy anymore." i was inspired by it (love) and it gave me a greater sense of appreciation and perspective. i felt light and joyful, even with all the confusion and pain that came with my profession. i like to think i was a better practitioner (and person) because of it.
By way of a reciprocal arrangement I was invited back by Paul to present a selection of Lion Nathan portfolio beers matched again to Mark’s simple but sophisticated country fare. Well, I assumed fairly early on that the last dinner had not dampened the enthusiasm as 102 beer lovers turned out this time around for some more small town hospitality.

I was diagnosed with aspergers 2002. I struggled throughout college in early 1990s and not sure if warning signs were arriving back then, but I did graduate with a C average. Autistic people, aspies and people with disabilities want respect, acceptance as we are and appreciation for their uniqueness. Though autism and aspergers affect each individual diffrently, I’m still learning what aspergers is… I know what I’ve experienced from it, but doesn’t mean I know what it is. anyhow, I want to be valued for achievements and my struggles because trying new endeavors is better than giving up and I won’t ever give up because I like learning something new every day. Autistic and aspies population like to have the same normal definition as the non-disabled and accept that we are normal in our own individual ways, not by other’s opinions what they think normal is.
Notes: It was surprisingly difficult to find a coffee joint that had soy milk. I mean honestly, I was surprised. Soy milk is on its way to surpassing dairy milk sales (someday people, its gonna happen). There’s plenty of little coffee carts and restaurants that sell coffee, I mean, they have to… have mercy on the parents of small children at Disneyland. However, none of these offered soy milk/soy lattes/coffee with soy/no. No soy for you. I’ll just torture you with the promise of coffee … let me just dangle the coffee in front of your face like a cat toy … Oh what’s that? You don’t like black coffee and you don’t like the exploitation of mother cows? Sorry!
Parents of autistic children showered Ms Blais with letters of support. They raised money for Ms Blais. They held a demonstration to support her and to demand the funding of one specific autism treatment, which was widely claimed to be the only way to prevent more autistic children from being killed by their parents. Carmen Lahaie, President of Montreal's autism society, stated in the media that Charles-Antoine was "happy now" that he was dead. The media published many stories about the "tragedy" of autism. On the news, it was reported that parents of autistic children wanted Ms Blais to represent them.

Thanks for the Mars answer. That's exactly what I was looking for. On that one: from my years of experience half-watching the Science Channel, I learned that we still have an atmosphere because of the magnetosphere deflecting solar winds that would otherwise strip it away. Is that entirely erroneous, or how do the lack of geological replenishment and the lack of magnetic protection compare in the care and feeding of an atmosphere?Well, that too is important, but only to an extent. The magnetosphere shields us from charged particles - such as energetic protons and electrons emitted in solar flares - but can't do anything about the uncharged ones like energetic photons. Sputtering will certainly happen faster without a magnetosphere, but extreme UV can still get in and do its worst.

The moment seems charged with a lot of dramatic weight in a way that a moment of action can never be. Moments of action are somewhat flat: in a moment of action, characters aren't feeling deep, complex emotions. They're either scared or angry, or maybe they could feel triumphant or defeated, I suppose....but in moments of action, when people are breaking down doors or ducking a bullet, they aren't feeling any deep complex emotions.
The Glidden Bittersweet Chocolate ended up not being dark enough for me. Unlike the French Chocolate paint by Glidden that I tried to use for the hall bath, this paint shade was not purple!

When we were at the hospital for Eva’s birth, just afterwards we took a picture of birthfather, birthmother and Eva together. The next day we printed out that picture to give to birthmother and she was surprised. She had no memory of that moment. Those precious moments after birth had been wiped from her hard drive. Some mothers forget the pain of childbirth and some of the moments afterwards. This could be because of Oxytocin, or whatever pain reduction meds she was on. I’m not a doctor, so I’m not going say what happened here.
Eco-Emi is a Eco-Friendly, Green and Vegan monthly lifestyle subscription service. Rather than just getting cosmetic and beauty samples, you get a mix of food, household, cleaning, health and wellness. It being a lifestyle box is great for me because I get to try a little bit of everything and helps introduce me to great Green Companies. I personally find the world of Green and Eco-Friendly products extremely overwhelming. Has helped so much, and I've found some products and companies that I had been passing up before and use everyday now. The cost of Eco-Emi is $15 monthly for residents of the US and $30 monthly for International residents. Payments are easy and secure through Paypal.

Unfortunately the scarf I got to review is no longer on the site because they sold out! Guess I have great taste! =)I've always loved animal print, but sometimes too much of an animal print can be downright tacky! Not to say that animal print is tacky, but just if you wear too much of it! I think that a scarf is a great way to incorporate animal print into your wardrobe if you are a more conservative type of person. I have been lusting over an animal print scarf for so long, but never got around to getting one so I was super happy that I got to do my review on it!

Our own half gastro Marathon complete consensus at the table is that dessert may be a dish too far. Meister and myself leave quickly for a pint at Cask while the ladies settle the bill. We are seated and served when we receive a call to say that we need to guess the bill. They sound please with themselves. We have a little time to think before they arrive. Knowing that it should be in the region of £150 we are dumbfounded with the final bill after an expert complaint. £55. Was it the right bill that they discounted? How did they reach that amount? I'll probably never know if this was an isolated incident for The Warwick, as despite the fact it was hugely discounted and the food was superb there are plenty of places that can get both right. So, Gold medal for Lou and O for world class complaining, Silver to myself for the Slalom, Bronze to Meister for his choice and a wooden spoon to The Warwick.
As is typical of little kids, they just ran up and fired when we were on our approach and in full concentration. A lot of people don’t realize just how distracting that really is! When I’m on the approach I’m in full concentration mode, my focus is entirely on my target spot on the lane and getting the right ball speed and rev rate for the lane conditions. Even so, there’s still something called peripheral vision and when you see someone walking up on the neighboring approach from your peripheral vision it’s distracting as all hell. This is why common bowling etiquette says to wait until the person on the neighboring lane finishes his/her shot before you begin your approach.

David says to me, "I can't remember how much I usually pay him". So I have a twenty and five ones on the ready. Charles comes to the door to say he's finished. David asks how much to pay and Charles tells him twenty. I hand him the twenty. I say, "Do you need me to take you home?" He says, "not really". I look at him harder and say "How did you get here?" He says, "I walked". I say, "If I don't take you home, how will you get home?" and he says "I'll walk". So I tell him to come on and I'll drive him home (about a one and a half miles).

Yes, of course it did raise a smile and there are many humorous angles you can bring to this. Youtube footage of Afghan parliamentarian Naeem Lalay Hameedzai trading machine-gun fire with the Taliban (analytical disclaimer: or Haqqani, or HIG) during the insurgent attack on Parliament during the 15th April complex attacks. And drinking his tea during the lull in fighting. And I’m sure there is an element of newly discovered Afghan popular pride at MPs actively and directly defending democracy. And I wonder how many MPs prefer this kind of solution – or at least understand it better than negotiation and compromise?
