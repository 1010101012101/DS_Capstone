But is the news all bad for the candidate? In 2008, most observers discussed Barack Obama's race as a potential impediment to his electoral success. Hillary Rodham Clinton won nearly half of the nation's Democratic primaries and caucuses, and she racked up large majorities of the white vote as the primary season advanced. In the end, African Americans gave Obama a decisive edge across the South and allowed him to gain the upper hand. (Obama also out-organized Clinton in caucus states across the country.)

Once that's taken care of, every conversation for days is "Will the baby poop? Has the baby pooped? Oh, the baby pooped! What was it like? What color was it? When will the baby poop again?" Onward and onward until you're just plain pooped out.

For the Nets, Okur, with an expired contract, figures to be a nice stopgap at center.

For Williams, despite a string of exceptional performances, "Blue Valentine" and "Brokeback Mountain" among them, it was a risky gambit taking on such an iconic star, one who had such luminous power on screen, such a heartbreaking story off.

So it's not a case of the U getting a pot of money, then assembling an experiment out of words pulled at random from a paper sack. I'm not furious that they're putting hamsters on diets. I'm furious that they haven't spent grant money to see what happens when you dump cocaine in mosquito breeding grounds. Maybe they can't sit still long enough to bite. Maybe you can dispel them with Mozart.

"I saw more people Tuesday in Hilton Head than the entire two weeks in Europe," he said. "That's no knock on them. The places we played were great, but it's hard to get to them. And there are adjustments with the travel. It's not like hopping on Southwest Airlines. When guys miss the cut, they tend to stick around for a couple of days. Over here, we spend $100 on a change fee and go home."

The panel shunned Dunn even though he was an audience favorite. His fatal mistake? For Blake, it was singing "The Man Who Can't Be Moved," which someone from Team Blake did last year and it brought back, well, memories. "Cindy did it last year and that sucks for you," the straight-shooting country star told the man who it turns out could be moved -- swiftly offstage.

Gong said he expects China to grow 7.2 percent this year. But he said potential problems include public expectations of a fall in prices, which can discourage spending and investment, a fall in demand for housing or further declines in trade.
To get some diversity of background and experience, it would be nice to be able to elect some non-prosecutors to the bench, but only if they have the skills to manage a courtroom. Joe Escalante, radio host, punk rock drummer and bass player, and music impresario as well as attorney, is no doubt the most interesting of this year's judicial candidates, but he offers little evidence to suggest that he's qualified to serve as a judge. Laurence Kaldor provides free legal representation to people who otherwise could not afford counsel, and it's admirable work. But Kaldor lacks sufficient courtroom experience and expertise.
The wild card is Rebekah Noble, the 2006 NCAA 800 champ. She rejoined the team last week after missing most of the previous 18 months with a broken foot. If she is in race-shape by the end of the season, well, look out.

"We lost quite a few seniors last year but we have a young group of core players that can contribute," Centerino said. "We're a sleeper team so hopefully if we have everyone injury-free we can go deep in the playoffs."
øThe first step is to determine the amount of annual withdrawals that needs be taken from a retiree's savings. After accounting for a retiree's income in retirement (Social Security, pension, etc.) and then looking at their budget, we determine the annual "gap," which must be funded by annual withdrawals from their savings - hopefully, it is no more than 4%.

There she finds the thin, pale Kowalski, who looks young enough to be in middle school, dressed in silky shorts, a T-shirt and sweater lying on a couch in the emergency room. She lies on her side in a fetal position with her knees pulled up slightly and her hands over her mouth. A nurse says her heart was racing at more than 120 beats per minute so doctors are watching Kowalski.

“He almost got a standing ovation before he walked out. I normally don’t listen to those speeches. But as he got going, I picked my head up and started listening to him. At the end, he basically told us he was speaking on behalf of the entire coaching staff. That there was a tremendous love to coach us, because of what we’ve been through, how our backs were against the wall, and how man to man we stood up — how we fought that adversity and never wavered and believed in each other and believed in him.”
"I'm not saying it's mine for sure, because you can't ever predict anything, especially in an event like the high jump," Williams said. " ... I think there are about six guys who can win, and I'm one of them. So my chances are just as good if not better than the other guys."
The 46-year-old impressed Canadiens owner Geoff Molson enough during a lengthy interview process to take a chance on a candidate with no previous experience as a GM, and who served only one year as an assistant after being named Stan Bowman's right-hand man with the Hawks on June 15, 2011.
Clemons called his instrument “a vehicle to move my spirit around.”
SONOMA, Calif. — It certainly seemed as if Kurt Busch's season was in serious trouble just two months ago, when poor performances led to an intense radio tirade against his entire Penske Racing organization.
"I think it's beautiful that those UCF fans are touched enough by my son's story that they want to honor him by wearing red bandannas," says Jefferson Crowther of his son. "It's almost like they're sending a message and telling people that college sports needs to get back to doing things the right way."
Doctors felt confident using the new drug regimen on Norris after years of lab work at Maryland, Bartlett said. The research supported the change as long as they also transplanted high amounts of "vascularized" bone marrow, which came inside the jaw transplanted into Norris' face. The bones and attached vessels give the marrow a ready place to live and steady supply of blood, and that seems to offer some continuous protection from rejection, Bartlett said, though researchers aren't entirely sure why.
Decor is very basic ... but the food is terrific. Specialties are Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese. We decided to try the Thai beef salad, shrimp and crab with glass noodles, and vermicelli with charbroiled shrimp. We also ordered the Thai iced tea with milk.

Most Important Observation of the Evening: Thank God Cee Lo is bald again.
Like much of what Lady Gaga does, the Tinkerbell bit was played for laughs, even though the star's fans -- her "little monsters" -- probably suspect that she's serious. A tremendously charismatic performer and an excellent singer, too, Gaga has never shed her burning desire to please the crowd. The Monster Ball tour has now been running for more than a year (the two-hour Atlantic City show was the kickoff of what must be the final leg), and Gaga seems reluctant to let it go. The pop star often compared to Madonna, but that's never sat right with me. Madonna never seemed to care if you were her fan or not; as long as you bought her record, she was happy. She was pop royalty and you weren't, and if you didn't like what she was doing, well, she had the sales numbers on her side. Lady Gaga, who admits that she was bullied in school and, consequently, had low self-esteem, claims a dependent connection to her listeners. "I never used to be brave," she told the crowd. "You made me brave."

The first set of boundaries drawn by the legislature produced a congressional map that was Kucinich's friend. But what the legislature gave Kucinich in September, it took away in December.
The new school would sit about a mile northeast of George Washington High School. In 2010, an air monitor atop that school recorded the state's highest levels of toxic chromium and sulfates, pollution that can trigger asthma attacks and heart problems. The BP Whiting refinery and the ArcelorMittal steel mill, two of the region's biggest sources of air pollution, are a couple of miles away.
The disarray among Republicans over a nominee and the controversial policies of the Obama administration set the stage for a contest rooted in contrasting visions for America's future.

A: What he's found is his arc. His shot was remarkably flat last season. Perhaps because of the lockout he has his legs back. Or perhaps he recognized that he had to start finding less-taxing ways to score. But you now have to look up to follow the trajectory of his shots.
As in the original story, Gregory Boyd and Jack Murphy's book sends Alice (Janet Dacal) on a wondrous journey. But here she's a young mother facing two dreadful situations: Her marriage is on the rocks and she's just moved to Queens.

UP starter Kody Watts (2-2) takes the loss after allowing four earned runs on six hits in 6.0 innings. Watts K'd four and walked just one. The Huskies scored one run in the second inning off of Watts and three more in the third, but the freshman right-hander would settle down from there and hold UW scoreless during the next three innings.

The stuck train on March 6 had 500 passengers aboard and caused delays that rippled throughout the system. That followed a morning of delays when maintenance work in the century-old train tunnel led to single-tracking on March 5.
Yao broke his left foot in the playoffs and underwent surgery that would keep him out the entire 2009-10 season. The Rockets went 42-40 without him and missed the postseason after winning at least 50 games in each of the previous three years.
The Minnesota Vikings at No. 3 are supposedly locked on Matt Kalil, a left tackle from Southern California. Kalil is considered a premium prospect, to be sure, and the Vikings could use him for the next 10 years. But Kalil, largely because of his position, can be bypassed at the right price. Put it this way: Teams who might want to trade up to No. 3 this year don't have Kalil in mind.
Aaagh! A Dementor is floating right in front of us. Someone screams. Then Harry appears and drives off the wraithlike creature with a Patronus Charm. He leads us through collapsing stone tunnels and gets us safely back to Hogwarts, where this story began.
Aretha Franklin has greatly influenced me as both a singer and piano player, from the time I was first listening to my sister's records in grade school, Kansas City native Kelley Hunt said. The thing that I was immediately drawn to was her all-out approach to singing, or whole-souled' way of expressing herself. As a piano player, I was also inspired by her accompanying herself on the piano, both in live performance and on the groundbreaking recordings she did with Jerry Wexler in Muscle Shoals.
There, John Guarini — a building inspector for the city — took a white, FedEx envelope stuffed with $20,000 in cash.
* Interstate 84 (Interstate 205 to Troutdale). Through Friday, you'll probably spot workers installing cameras and high-tech gear. No, they're not with Homeland Security, at least that's what ODOT's telling us. Officials say crews are installing nine new traffic cameras. It shouldn't gunk-up the commute too much: Shoulder closures from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. and a detour on the bike path from 201st Avenue to 207th.
Chrysler is seeking more freedom to hire lower-paid new workers and a less generous bonus plan than GM or Ford.
Q Let's get last season out of the way. Your team lost the Class 3A championship game when Burnsville rallied with six runs in the bottom of the seventh inning. Has it been tough putting that behind you?

Gigot: The big problem here, it seems to me, James, is these loan guarantees. They're a free lunch for politicians because they don't have any cost at first. They don't appear to have any cost, except when they go bad.

Up next for Centaurus (9-4-2) is a second match at D'Evelyn.
There is no comparable epidemic of half-Hispanic neighborhood-watch volunteers like George Zimmerman shooting young black men. Nor is there an epidemic of cops doing the same. Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute notes that in New York City, there were nine civilian victims of police gunfire last year, whereas there were "several hundred black homicide victims in the city, almost all shot by other blacks or Hispanics, none of them given substantial press coverage."
Spampinato said Hurricane Irene has forced the cancellation of more than 60 blood drives along the East Coast, resulting in a shortfall of 2,000 units of blood. Some sites where drives have been scheduled are without power, damaged or not accessible.
Smith said additional barricades are "not feasible" because they would limit the land's use as a police staging area. "People are still able to use it as a dog area, walking area or just a place to sit down," he said.

Reasons for council opposition varied.
There has never been anybody actually opposed to my rule — although I have on occasion been required to take action against those least in favor of it. Have you heard of the Muqtani tribes in the north of Wadiya, the Burgah people in the south or the country's nomadic Qulanas? No. That's because they never existed. And do not believe any Zionist propaganda that says otherwise.
Christie took up his criticism of Obama again today, calling him a "failed leader" and saying the nation will be better if he is a "one termer."
The inflated nature of the state's job claims is especially apparent when judged against the far bigger federal stimulus program.
Hundreds of Steuben pieces swarm shelves, tables and cabinets throughout Dimitroff's home. He traces his fascination to his teens in the 1950s when he accompanied his father, a doctor, on visits to company founder Frederick Carder's home.

A message left after hours Monday with Richard Curtner, Keyes' appointed federal public defender, was not immediately returned.
Attention to seafood freshness carried through to the good fish flavor in the shrimp tempura ($16 dinner, $7.50 lunch). The crunchy, cigarlike, panko-crusted shrimp came with battered and fried vegetables and were both crispier and less oily than most.
Intelligent design, on the other hand, is blatantly antiscientific. Can you imagine what sort of chaos would ensue if a biology teacher decided to incorporate the book of Genesis into lesson plans? Yet here we are, once again debating evolution vs. intelligent design in schools and seemingly reaching no new avenues for a proper solution.
The new unit would provide an additional layer of oversight for CPS investigations, housed under DES but separate from CPS. The unit's proposed role has shifted somewhat over the past several months and its particulars remain murky. Differing descriptions have been offered from the Governor's Office, Montgomery and DES, and the House bill that would create the unit. So it's not clear where these new investigators would be deployed or what they would do, though it's doubtful they would take on caseloads and relieve CPS caseworkers of their current responsibilities.
The Novi jeweler, whose wife and two young sons were killed by a drunken driver in 2005, talks about the tragedy and about his seven-year quest to find peace and to forgive the man who killed them.

A very close second and owner of the best regular season in team history -- and one of the best in NFL history. Overall, though, Anderson was slightly less accurate than Longwell as a Viking (84.5 percent on field goals) and didn't have as much range. He also missed the kick of which we do not speak in the 1998 NFC title game, following his perfect regular season.

"Obama has the softer image dimensions tied up: He's likable, compassionate, feels your pain, relates, understands," says Frank Newport, Gallup's editor in chief.

That makes curbing childhood obesity a much more complicated issue than tobacco use, Katz and other experts agree. The message to kids and their families can't be "stop, don't do this," which is clear and easy to understand. Instead it has to be "make good choices, do this in moderation, set boundaries," a message that is considerably more difficult to convey.

They can return next season. Griner said she won't turn professional and join the WNBA — or the NBA, for that matter — and coach Kim Mulkey will have eight players back — and "one of our (incoming) players was MVP of the All-American game," the coach added.
My favorite was when my dad retired. He was a hardware salesman, also a history fan. He wasn't a big one to take vacations, but when he retired he and I flew to Europe and took a cruise to the Greek Islands. We saw Ephesus, Santorini, Crete. It was just amazing. We toured all the ruins. It was a real eye-opening experience for him and for me, too. That was his first cruise; he was 63 at the time. As a result, my dad is 82 and has probably been on 25 cruises. He just loves it. He goes to places that have a lot of history. When we go, we always request to sit at a large table because my dad likes to meet new people and learn about them and what they do.

"We cannot allow one company's anti-China crusade to threaten the U.S. solar industry and tens of thousands of American jobs," said Jigar Shah, president of the coalition opposing SolarWorld's trade action.

However, some, like John Kasley, a Williamsburg retiree, have dropped their dental insurance as premiums soared. Currently healthy, Kasley says he would seriously consider using such deals for health services.
Probably because it dealt with an innocent -- a girl who was 7 when she disappeared and is still childlike and unformed when she's discovered, 9 years later -- "Let Your Hair Down" was a less sure-footed blend. How irreverent can you be when dealing with a missing child (never mind the undercooked Rapunzel long-hair angle)? On the one hand, Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) was as bracingly amusing as ever. On the other, he was serving as a sort of father figure for the girl, which made his wisecracks about her feel a little off-kilter.
Still, at what point does airport security cross the line between proper safety measures and prejudicial pat-downs? How do I protect myself? Most of us are too scared to say anything. I know I am.
"We know it can't just be for people visiting from out of town," Sarah Mensah, the Blazers' chief marketing officer, said during a recent show-and-tell. "The only way this works is if Portland embraces it, if we make it something Portland will embrace."

The high court's judges asked about that potential referendum and its effect on the current case. Lawyers said the outcome of any referendum was not relevant. They said it will only address whether voters want to allow same-sex marriages in Maryland, not whether the state should recognize same-sex unions performed elsewhere. Even if voters decide not to allow same-sex marriages, state courts should grant divorces for same-sex couples, the lawyers said. They cited Wyoming and New Mexico as states with similar practices.

The win came a few hours after Lin -- or at least the phenomena he has become -- was spoofed in a hilarious bit that opened "Saturday Night Live." (Watch it here.)

They don't sound all that appetizing, but the White Castle burger (cheese, no cheese, double, with jalapenos, whatever) is a food that I sheepishly confess is one of my faves.

It wouldn't take anyone very long to realize that Ford people are winners by nature. The sense of pride in the value Ford has always created in more than a century is obvious and justified. And it is encouraging that there are so many areas of excellence we can point to within our company right now. But pockets of success aren't enough. Not today. Not in this competitive environment. We need success across our entire enterprise. To get there, we need to have a universally agreed to and understood business plan. It needs to be a single plan, and it needs to work for the entire company. Competitors may try to "divide and conquer" us; I'm determined we are not going to do that to ourselves. So we need to set such a plan in place and ensure that everyone knows how we're doing against it. We need to agree on the urgent issues, and we need to work together as never before to achieve our objectives.

"In my statements regarding Mr. Meekins' request for a refund, I failed to explain why our policy on refunds makes Spirit Airlines the only affordable choice for so many travelers, and I did not demonstrate the respect or the compassion that I should have, given his medical condition and his service to our country. Therefore I have decided to personally refund Mr. Meekins' airfare, and Spirit Airlines will make a $5,000 contribution, in his name, to the charity of his choice," CEO Ben Baldanza announced in a statement released by Spirit.

There are many factors to consider. If you have a good relationship with your daughter and can be honest with her, talk to her about the divorce and remarriage of her mom and the relationship between your ex-wife and yourself. Hopefully, you have a healthy friendship with her mom and the two of you do not talk negatively about each other. This is a big plus, and she will be in a better position to accept a new person in your life.
I'm not convinced that one side is entirely correct, though. If I had four young kids (I have three) most fire codes would require me to reserve two rooms. Never mind that we'd probably all sleep in the same room, anyway. At the same time, I'm not in favor of an "anything goes" approach that would make a hotel room look like the aftermath of spring break in Daytona Beach.

"I believe they can sell naming rights for their jersey tomorrow; but to their credit, they want to sell it for more money than probably they're able to get if they wanted to close the deal short-term. This is a group that has very, very high expectations as to what they think the value of that jersey is, and the league is very supportive of that. So they're economically in reasonably good shape, selling out every game, have lots of luxury product within their stadium, doing well financially and if they needed it, they would do it. But I think they're waiting to get the right deal at the right time and at the right price."

If the Times article offers any sort of possible resolution to this problem, it's federal regulation. Which may, in fact, be on the horizon now that this story has appeared a month before horse racing takes the national spotlight in Louisville.

But today fears about Europe returned. A "no" vote from Slovakia could rattle the financial markets and complicate European efforts to deal with the debt crisis that has already caused three countries to get bailouts.
At other times, expert service was in short supply. After eating salad and meat courses, we waited 30 minutes for our custom-ordered omelets and waffles. Plenty of later customers got theirs swiftly, making us feel forgotten. Zanzibar calls itself sexy and sophisticated, which is a valid claim. But on one quiet weeknight we were walked past plenty of available tables and seated next to another couple. The place filled up much later, but, sadly, both of our parties missed out on some private time.

Steeling myself for the big one, I browsed the stands, sampling crickets (bland and crunchy) and locusts (meaty and the legs stick between the teeth) before buying a bag of tarantulas. Shutting my eyes, I dipped my hand in the bag, pulled off a leg and nibbled. Surprisingly, once the initial revulsion wore off, the taste was not so bad. The texture of the a-ping was rough and crispy like a pork crackling, but inside it was tender and fatty and tasted a bit like cod.
But "something was gnawing at me," he recalled.

But after the financially troubled racing group missed its last tree-planting deadline in November, city officials decided to go ahead with putting the trees in this spring — at taxpayer expense, if necessary. That's how it's turned out, because the city severed ties with the debt-swamped racing group in late December after it failed to pay $1.5 million in taxes and fees owed.
In the AFC championship game two weeks ago, the Baltimore Ravens held Brady to 22-of-36 passing. He didn't throw a touchdown pass and was intercepted twice. It was the first time since the Patriots' 2009 regular-season finale that Brady didn't throw a touchdown pass.

Meanwhile, a separate bill (Substitute House Bill 159) to require Ohio voters to have a photo ID with them before they're allowed to vote remains stalled in the Senate. (The ID bill could, possibly, win Senate approval this week.) Republicans run the Senate, 23-10. If the ID bill does emerge and shuttles back to Ohio's House for final action, that debate will be even hotter than the late-June debate over election "reform."

About 13% of the 37 million people who live in California are of Asian descent, according to 2009 census data. About two-thirds of them are first-generation immigrants, said Paul Ong, a UCLA professor who has served as an advisor to the census. Many of them work in businesses owned by Asians, many of whom typically cut employees' hours as a first response to an economic downturn rather than let them go, Ong said. That explains in part why the California unemployment rate for Asians is relatively low, just 9.5% in July, compared with 17.1% for blacks, 14.9% for Latinos and 12.0% for whites.
