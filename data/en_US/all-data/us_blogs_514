There are also issues we will not agree on, but can agree even within our disagreement. For example, no matter how we feel about abortion we can surely agree that we’d rather not see abortion take place. If it’s by law or if it’s by helping women not to become expectant and find it necessary, we can work toward fewer abortions.

Researchers looked at the records of nearly 1,100 patients. On average, patients discharged home clocked 8.6 hours in the emergency department, but patients admitted to a psychiatric unit within the hospital stayed 11 hours. (Patients transferred to an outside unit in the local healthcare system stayed 12.9 hours, and those transferred to a facility outside the local system stayed 15 hours.)

What? You are not having those visions of glory? You are not feeling the love? Could it be that you are more concerned with you than with God? Could it be that you want God as your back-up plan in case you fail? I occasionally see a bumper sticker that says, God is my co-pilot. God doesn’t want to be your second in command. He wants to be first. Matthew 6:33 But first, be concerned about his kingdom and what has his approval. Then all these things will be provided for you. When we put God first, then we can have the blessings. When we put Him anywhere but first, we can only have the warning of correction if we don’t change our ways, but God always shows the promise of how much it is worth the change to seek Him first and all else after that.

Until I had kids, I thought I could just bring them to rehearsal and they'd be quiet. I don't know why I thought this. I was a nanny, so the idea that I even ever really thought this is embarrassing. One rehearsal period I did bring my daughter when she was a baby. I felt so guilty getting a sitter or asking my family for the help I really needed. I will never do that again. I spent most rehearsals walking her around or shhing her. After that I got familiar with babysitting websites and figured out what kind of sitters would work best given the demands of rehearsal, and worked to banish the word guilt from my vocabulary. Which is important. While I will help my kids talk through their feelings about my being gone a lot and for long periods of time, I have stopped apologizing for the leaving the house. I don't want either kid to feel as though I should be ashamed for the work I do and for leaving them.
In the America I see, character and choices matter. And education, hard work, and living within our means are valued and rewarded.

Young and old, men and women, chant together here to remind Fatah and Hamas that national unity matters above all else and that our freedom and path to liberation is led by the prisoners who dared to speak out and stand up and those who support them.

This pokes a hole in one theory put forward at one of my readings that Seattleites are New Yorkers turned inside out. The theory goes that in New York, people are crusty on the outside, warm on the inside. In Seattle, it's just the opposite: superficial smiles and then avoidance of intimacy. Apparently, Seattle and New York have something in common. Or at the very least we have data that suggests that in Seattle, we treat all newcomers like New Yorkers treat Frenchmen!

I haven’t been over there in awhile, but I’m pretty sure it’s all lofted up these days.

There were two people involved and we both enjoyed it… But I should have made him wait. Now he might not respect me, might think that was too easy and be over it…How the hell could he be that hypocritical? He’s just as much of a slattern as me… Too bad no one wants an easy woman.

Later, we're having an indoor log cabin fireplace dinner. Nicki wants to know how many kids he wants. He says that he's talked about it with his sister and they both want 4 kids. Well, who's going to have kids with Nicki then? Oh, not with each other. Never mind. Nicki is down with the Fantasy Suite. It's a chalet with a hot tub and champagne! Nicki luckily remembered her lime green bikini and now let's make out in the hot tub and slowly fade out and ewww I don't want to think about what happened next.
And here's the thing: I felt that way about that family's choices even though I had longed for release from school when I was a kid, my longing set against my absolute certainty that such release was, sadly, impossible. I carried that certainty with me for a long time. School, I knew, was a given, like teething. Yes, it hurt, but it was necessary. You had to go through it or you'd end up gumming your way through life.

In my more than humble opinion a game with the Cyclones is a good time to be had. The stadium is small but feels full and expansive. There are great sight-lines throughout the park and the background dressing of the Parachute Jump on one side, and the Cyclone rollercoast in the distance add to the easy summer atmosphere. Games also manage a lovably corny air with enjoyably hokey family friendly entertainment between innings and lots of local characters. Best enjoyed with a group, sitting behind home plate. Oh and if you sit along the foul lines, be ready to catch or duck.

The only underlying theme is the same as every other fantasy romance out there: Girl has intense physical reaction to guy upon first meeting.

Prime Minister Gilani rejected a personal request by President Karzai in a phone call on Tuesday, saying if Afghanistan officially condemned the ISAF airstrike, Islamabad might reconsider the boycott decision on the Bonn II. There is a fuss about this boycott in the international media, calling it a blow to the entire process. The question is what if the ISAF strike had not happened and Pakistan was in Bonn? Would it make the chances of a breakthrough in the peace process with Taliban more plausible? Of course not! The fact that Pakistan has significant influence over the Taliban leaders makes it an important player in the process, but there was no progress in the US efforts to persuade Pakistani military in this regard. Both countries have contrary objectives for the endgame in Afghanistan. Pakistani military is against long-term presence of US troops beyond 2014, which will be approved in a US-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement, supported by a Traditional Loya Jirga recently.

However, the best parts of the job more than compensated for the irritations. I loved having the freedom to spend vast sums of money buying new titles from publishers' reps (all of whom seemed to be called Brian or Keith), taking a punt on an unknown author or range, only to find that I'd spotted a new trend, like the Aga saga craze. In my first year at Waterstone's, two buying decisions alone paid for my salary.

Falling in Love featured two duets with Harry Belafonte.

PR Couture’s strategy is offering useful solution, information, and trend in fashion PR industry. Crosby said “I offer a free PR Plan template to new email subscribers.

Jirard “Completionist” Kahlil takes your favourite, most beloved games, and violates them in that most holy of ways: by filling them full of completion. Every single secret, hidden room, gem, coin & chocobo is uncovered, and reviewed; with offscreen comic Greg providing hilarious interludes, and playing the role of the online troll, to which Jirard fields questions normally deftly hurled by trolls. I’m always impressed by Jirard’s commitment, and I really feel the toil every time I see him finally roll round to the final level. The reviews are succint, yet in-depth, and the visual accompaniments to Greg’s off-screen humour are one the many things that keeps me coming back.

Dad says a sale isn't a sale until title passes and money changes hands, but that's another story for another day). But first the buyer wanted "his friend the lawyer" to look it over. My Dad said, "Sure, why not." My Dad, The Most Ethical Person Ever, would never give legal advice nor draft a contract without having a client give it to a lawyer, despite the fact that the lawyers always told him that Dad's contracts were better than theirs.

Been coned? – Another curious driving behavior I’ve noticed here is what I call courtesy or maybe just plain patience? During peak commute times there are a few streets in Honolulu that get “coned” or lined with orange maintenance cones. This is some sort of adaptation of a reversible lane. I’m not really sure how they are set up, but when a section of a road is coned you can drive in what would otherwise be the oncoming lane of traffic. It somehow redraws the lines by directing traffic into other lanes. There are permanent postings on the side of the streets saying things like, “No Left Turn when coned.”

Moral and ethical issues and democratic values get subordinated in the face of corruption perpetuated by the oppressive caste system. There is not even the remotest desire to make democracy more functional. The caste system with graded inequality remains popular amongst those whose privileges are associated with it. For the same reason, the idea of egalitarian society fails to gain currency in their quarters. Lessons like, “United we stand and divided we fall” are hard to learn and even if by mistake they are learnt, they become hard to implement. Caste is meant to divide, not unite. A nation which lost its freedom on that account should be cautious, lest its divisions drive it to a state of subservience to an alien rule again. What ‘hidden pride’ lies in discriminating against and oppressing one’s own countrymen and co-religionists is hard to discern.

After two more Bagatelles, the quartet concluded their concert with an interpretation of Brahms “Hungarian Dance nr 5”. It is always dangerous to select a well-known piece and play it on instruments it was not originally written for, especially when the instruments used are not closely related to the original instruments the composer wrote the piece for. This interpretation was nice enough; but totally not dazzling, nor captivating.

These examples demonstrate how long and treacherous the road will be for the cause of women’s rights in Saudi Arabia. Even decisions at the highest level of government in an absolute monarchy such as ours will only just begin to dent the armor of fundamentalism behind which many hide their misogyny.

The sad fact is that I don't. Well, I've got lots of people who are spiritually and symbolically in my corner, but I had come to peace with the sad reality that I'd most likely be the only competitor there without a coach or someone sitting in their corner. It's just something that I've accepted without dwelling on. Dave asked if I'd like him in my corner, and I accepted. HE was my team today.
...so Christmas has come and gone, not without a visit to the ER. Just 3 days before the holiday, Zelda had a seizure - there were good things and bad things to come out of it. I can't help but think what a life without toxoplasmosis would be like for her. Creed is far less affected by the parasite in his system. He has had only one seizure in his lifetime: when he was a baby - and they attributed it to a fever. Sure, he has his 2 VP shunts in his brain and wears glasses due to the toxo scar on his right macula but he sees everything and "he will learn to read 'normally' and drive" - as they repeated over and over again to us in the NICU upon diagnosis of the infection. Zelda somehow got such a higher dose of the parasite - possibly due to her placement in my uterus.
So, I have decided, that I am going to write with a new goal in mind- to let my sister know how much I love her and believe in her on a regular basis. Sometimes, I will send her love via a short message or a long note of support. Sometimes it maybe simply a photo or song of inspiration or gentle nudge, but, somehow, I hope I will get through to her. I will be the sister or friend I know I am capable of being even though I am not there.
They are still real integer Catholics who want to bring a signal to save the Roman Catholic Church. As in both the Protestant and Catholic Church those people serving those churches should in first instance bringing over Gods Word. They should proclaim the Good News. It should be about the Sacrificial Offer by Jesus. Both have to talk about atonement and reconciliation.
If you have a spark of Christian compassion in you, it will surely seem worth your utmost labor to save so many ‘souls from death, and to cover’ so great ‘a multitude of sins.’ If, then, you are indeed fellow-workers with Christ, set to his work, and neglect not the souls for whom he died. O remember, when you are talking with the unconverted, that now you have an opportunity to save a soul, and to rejoice the angels of heaven, and to rejoice Christ himself, to cast Satan out of a sinner, and to increase the family of God! And what is your ‘hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? ’ Is it not your saved people ‘in the presence of Christ Jesus at his coming? ’ Yes, doubtless ‘they are your glory and your joy.’
This is the seventh version of the Multimedia Manual, but I am dubbing it version 8 beta. The beta status also comes as a result of the shorter writing time. I’m not sure that everything here in version seven is going to work! There are many new assignments, and many major changes. One major change is the exit of Adobe Photoshop and the entry of The Gimp. The change was made because Adobe does not write Photoshop Elements for the Intel Macs, and second because The Gimp is FREE! The Gimp is an open source application written with UNIX so it can be adjusted and molded to work with whatever environment one is comfortable with. So I was able to change all of the keyboard shortcuts and setup the palette layout to match Photoshop LE. The Gimp will also run on Windows and Linux so it’s a good choice for students who may not have a Macintosh computer at home.

Saving Private Ryan (Produced by Steven Spielberg, Ian Bryce, Mark Gordon and Gary Levinsohn)
While George Zimmerman’s comments may suggest a disdain for criminals in general or even a specific type of person in general, no good evidence yet exists that offers proof that race played a factor in his decision to call the police regarding Martin, or in his alleged decision to follow, confront or shoot Martin. The primary piece of evidence used to suggest Zimmerman was at least partially motivated by race was a piece of audio from his 911 call that was initially interpreted as him saying “fucking coons.” The term “coon” has a well-known derogatory connotation towards black people. Since initially being released to the public, this audio has been enhanced and analyzed by audio technicians. The consensus so far appears to be that Zimmerman did not use this term, but rather said something along the lines of “fucking cold,” due to the unseasonably cold weather at the time, or “fucking punks,” which does not have an inherent racial dimension to it. While it is definitely possible race played some role in Zimmerman’s reasoning, unless there is solid evidence to prove this is the case, it should not be assumed. Absent new evidence of racial bias, Zimmerman probably will not be convicted of a federal hate crime even if he is convicted of other crimes.

Another track which has its only released version being a BBC session version, the known-and-loved release variant was recorded in December 1986 for John Peel at the BBC. Interestingly though, they did have a fully-recorded, mixed, release-ready take in the can, recorded during the "Ask" sessions in June 1986. For whatever reason it remained binned, to the point when it came time to select B-sides for the "Sheila Take A Bow" single in spring 1987, the band went to the (admittedly superior) Peel recording rather than the June 1986 studio take. This version is a bit more shimmery than the common version, and Marr's guitar is a bit more rhythmically choppy than the BBC take. The song, good in the original mono leak, jumps to life in this stereo version. I love this!

I'm always intrigued by books involving the Holocaust, and this one had a unique perspective as 2/3rds of it is written by a prisoner of war. There were a few points were I found my eyes starting to glaze as it seemed to get a little long-winded, but overall a good book and a heart-breaking tale of friendship.

But in Britain today, we have a further cause for grave concern. A world-respected news organisation (the BBC) that is State supported – but not State controlled – now faces a stand-up market share battle with that very same mogul-owned media group. This is an organisation that wants to increase its chances of dominance by buying out a satellite group of which it is already a shareholder….and enthusiastically endorsed the Prime Minister when he was himself the Leader of the Opposition.

Blinker Definition: I define people that I come into contact with as either slow blinkers or fast blinkers. You have to have something to size people up by. You do it too! You can “blink both ways” but you are mostly one or the other. I know I am a fast blinker because when I talk, slow blinkers look out of the top of their eyes at me. I am sure “Conservative, Connecticut, Catholic, Cathy” found me a bit overwhelming. This was never going to work.

I am quite concerned, as you know about increasing tectonic activity in this period. April 22nd through the 26th, Mercury goes over the Uranus/Pluto square which is the destabilizing square in effect till early 2016.

This is a time period that these events may accelerate.
In 2007, Jean created a mural for the Prada Epicenter stores in New York and Los Angeles. He also created a backdrop for Prada’s Spring/Summer 2008 show in Milan. Aspects of the Epicenter mural and the Milan wallpaper were transformed into clothing, handbags, shoes, and packaging. Prada undertook a global campaign that featured Jean’s work in advertising environments, animation, and special events. Jean developed an animated short based on the theme titled ‘Trembled Blossoms,’ taken from the poem ‘Ode to Psyche,’ by John Keats (one of his darker and more experimental odes). In 2010, Jean was commissioned by fashion designer Phillip Lim to paint a series of portraits featuring Los Angeles-based actors, musicians, and tastemakers, including Rachel Bilson, Selma Blair, and Devendra Banhart.
Why buy pre-owned?
So you have this amazing game and you paid 60$ for that game. You and 500k other people shelled out your 60$ to buy the game. Unfortunately the game cost double that to develop maybe triple. The studio is forced to close and your favorite IP is going to be gone forever. You think to yourself the game was so good it was amazing why didn’t others buy it? Then to your shock and dismay you find out in North America alone 2.5 million copies were downloaded. If only one fifth of those thieves paid full retail the studio would not have shuttered hundreds would have jobs and your favorite game would get a sequel.

D day as I sometimes call it...The day we "found out". Ignorance was bliss for this family of five. November 30, 2009 was to be a happy one. One of naming a baby...finding out the sex of our sweetling...It was a family affair. I worked half a day and took off to go have our 20 week ultrasound. I left amidst co-worker's well wishes...some stopping to venture a guess as to whether we were having a boy or a girl. All smiling telling me that they could not wait to find out. Students telling me to wear pink tomorrow for a girl...blue for a boy. I promised to share the wonderful news in some special way. I was almost giddy with excitement. I left work and stopped for a bite to eat. After a quick lunch, I went and picked up the kiddos and we made our way to Montgomery where we would meet up with Jamie. There was so much excitement in the car on the 50 mile trip to the doctor. We met Jamie in the parking lot and all walked up to the office with lots of chatter among our happy little family. We sat in the waiting room waiting to be called back. We read the standard doctors office magazines during our wait. We tried to tame the wild beast of excitement building in our children. Our time eventually came. Michelle came to the door and called for us to come back with a wink and a grin. We went in and Lord have mercy we tried to all get settled in that dark little room. Then she began and in that moment...that one tiny, little moment the walls came tumbling down. Just as the walls of Jericho tumbled down, so did our ignorant bliss...our lives changed forever. We learned our baby had no fluid. Without fluid our baby would not live. I knew instantaneously that our road would be a difficult one. I saw it on their faces...Dr. K, the nurses, the staff...They all had that look...If you are walking this journey, you know the look I am talking about. I'd like to say I remember every single moment of the rest of that day, but truth be told it is all a hazy fog. I remember bits and pieces of conversation with Dr. K...bits and pieces of others (the amazing ladies in the Dr. office) taking care of my kids while we tried to figure out our next step...Mrs. J putting her arms around me while I shook with racking sobs...Jamie telling me it was going to be alright...bits of conversation with the kids about their disappointment over not finding out if it was a boy or girl (They didn't know what was going on.)...checking out and being told we would go to a specialist for confirmation in the next couple of days...Stay off of your feet...Drink plenty of fluids...It all runs together after time.

Liam had his party today, it was super hero themed. He would have been happy at Chucky CheeseI(I would have rather given birth again with no drugs than do that-sorry Chuck). I, on the other hand, live for parties. My husband? Not so much. He loves Liam to pieces, other kids? UMM...not so much! He actually would be a great stay home and when I "let" him retire for the second time, he will do a great job! lol Anyway I bought the Batman and Superman carts and made his invites, center pieces,banner, cupcake toppers and sign. I had a blast doing it. Those pieces are way small on the cart and it was a bit aggravating! Seriously, anyone have those cartridges? I still can't get a grip on the sizes, real dial, regular whatever... four trillion pieces later and I managed to make some pretty cool center pieces. Anything for the little dude! (including my sanity apparently)We invited 12 other children and although me being the control freak wanted to organize games and such, they only wanted to bounce in the Marvel themed bounce house! Oh well, I relented....(and then played pin the bat on the moon by myself later! ha)Some of the kids dressed up as their favorite super heroes which was lots of fun. They played all day in the bounce house and with all of Liam's super heroes and cars. What great kids! Here are some photos(ok, a lot of photos!)
Seriously, we talked families and life.

Dad and Aunt Kelly laughed loudly, breaking my daydream. They were talking about the old days when they used cord phones and played practical jokes on neighbors. It was a better time, they said, and that the kids don’t understand what fun is. They always got along and talked so highly about the days of yore, as roller derby and sock hops were trendy and the posteriors weren’t focused on as much as they are now. Leather jackets, watches, and dresses were what they were judged on as they would enter the dance. Now we just dance like we’re fucking in public, asking where the innocence of youth went.

I celebrated my 23rd birthday a few weeks ago and enjoyed a meal out with my husband at our favorite chain seafood restaurant, Bonefish Grill. If you haven't been to one, go! It does not feel like a chain restaurant and doesn't taste like a chain restaurant. We always order the same appetizer every visit: the bang bang shrimp. I've tried to copy-cat the sauce in this dish, it's spicy, sweet, creamy, and oh-so yummy, but have failed miserably in the past. This time, I finally got close. This recipe is not identical, but very similar and a little healthier because I skip the deep frying, so I might need to call it "pow pow" or "boom boom" shrimp because it's not the true blue "bang bang" shrimp.

After asking for the usual driver's license, registration and proof of insurance, she's fishing all throughout the front passenger compartment for the stuff. She tells me its in the trunk of her car. So I follow her back to the trunk and she cannot find her registration and proof of insurance. She fishes out her driver's license from her purse and her pink cellular phone fell to the ground. I asked if I could look at her call log and her obvious answer was "no".
to get this look, I start by sanding down alllllll of the pieces, to remove all of the old stain and polyurethane.

Sanding is a tough and not so fun job! I can't stand the sneezing, stuffy noses, and itchy eyes that come with sanding (yes, we do wear glasses and masks!) But, it must be done!

“Uh, I think you’ve had a few friend,” I respond hastily. I was about to get up, but my last word seemed to have struck quite a cord with the man.

I don’t know about other women, but I wouldn’t want to date a man exclusively if he already knew he didn’t want me as a wife or as a live-in partner – heck, if he still had doubts after one year – peace! I would say, “Okay, fine. Yes, I like/love you – let’s continue to date. But I reserve the right to date other men if I choose to do that, and you are free to do the same. I just ask that if you start sleeping with someone else, please let me know.” That way, there’s less of a chance for hurt feelings (sometimes that just can’t be helped), and everyone is on the same page. It’s honest. And, when you’re really not sure where you are, it’s always best to just come clean and be honest. I mean, it might not be HER, right? Maybe you want to live in Russia when you retire, and she just wants to go to Alabama. That wouldn’t work. Maybe you thought she was ‘the one’ at first and now you’re like, “No, I didn’t realize she was….” and that doesn’t have to be a negative thing – it could be that she’s so into you that she neglects her own life and centers her social life around your life and based on what you’re doing or what you two will do and not do together. Some men love women who adjust their lives like that….but I also know some men who would hate it. Maybe she fits the ideal woman you want- she gets a check next to every thing on your list, but you just aren’t INTO her like that. You don’t have to tell her WHY if it’s going to hurt her feelings, but *I* think she deserves to know that you don’t see her that way or that you’re still not sure.

I've always been an outspoken individual and have also enjoyed writing (Actually, when I was young, I tried to write a book series with a friend about two mischievous horseback-riding girls). In college I took some public speaking classes, and eventually got into communications. Unfortunately, some of my interests in writing and communication had to sit on the back-burner while I applied to and completed medical school. Now that the intensity of school has calmed down, I have become very involved in blogging, freelance writing, and social media, particularly for the medical field.

Heeeelllllooooooo Blog Readers!!! :) Finally, after 3 weeks, I went roller skating tonight! :) Until about 3 hours before I left it looked as if I wouldn’t be able to go as well :) But more on that later, I’ve got a whole day of doing nothing to talk about first ;) Ok, so I started the day by watching the new episode of The Big Bang Theory, which was AWESOME ;) Then I watched a load more of 90210 (not all at once, throughout the day. Actually I think I only watched perhaps 2 episodes today, maybe 3, so not that many compared to recent days). I also FINISHED Fawlty Towers :D Such an amazingly funny show, though I do suspect it is funnier watching it with other people. I watched a couple of episodes on New Years Day when I was up at The Kingsley’s in Nottingham, and there was about 10 of us watching them, and I remember laughing my head off ;) Laughing is definitely a group activity, and although I found the episodes funny when watching them here, I wasn’t laughing as much as I think, at least not out loud. But still a brilliant show, it’s such a shame they only made 12 episodes of it :/

So after letting him eat almost his weight in blackberries for a mid morning snack, I set out to look for a way to use the remaining berries in a dessert to be had that night after dinner.

If you are like me then you dread going to the grocery store every week. An easy way to make your weekly grocery trips even easier is to buy all the non perishable items for the whole month on your first shopping trip of the month. Just like cooking once, shopping once may take a few minutes longer on the first trip but will save you time later in the month. You are already there, you might as well get as much as you can so all you have left is a quick stop for the perishable items you need each week. You can freeze meats & cheeses so get those on that first trip too, especially if they are on sale.

The trip to where I am today isn’t what I expected so many years ago, I am sure that my classmates would agree. I have not had many opportunities to meet with my classmates over the years. In fact, in the past 30 years, I have lived in Star Valley for just 6 months in the 80’s, 3 months in the 90s, about 4 years in the 00’s, just 1 year in the 10s so far as I am now living in China. I know that I have classmates that have lived there even less than I have.
Need for political reform
On the weekend of the January 27, 2012, activists from around Cape Town planned to march to the Rondebosch Common, an open public space and conservation area in the town, to hold an three-day ‘peoples summit’. Driven by civic groups and associations from some of the poorest areas on the peninsula, and joined by middle-class supporters, this was intended to create a participatory space to discuss some of the country’s most urgent issues: housing, rent arrears, evictions, political corruption and high levels of inequality.
This meatball recipe is very quick to put together, but takes 3 hours to cook on the stove, or 6 hours in the slow cooker, so plan ahead. I like to make a big batch and use them for lunches all week, but you could certainly freeze some instead. It's kind of funny that my Irish grandmother passed down such a delicious Italian recipe, but I think someone told me she got it from a neighbor :)
NOTE: And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

During the gig of the Canadian band Crystal Castles @ Tunglið, Saturday 18. October, the press (photographers) people were not allowed in front of the stage. This was the first time ever for me not to be allowed there @ Airwaves, and without any notice some time before. So I was hanging with my head in heavy noise, fortunately with earplugs. It took the band a long time to start playing, and because of that the atmosphere was getting tence/nervous/à la Heizel dramatique for the first time in an overcrowded venue spot (where everybody wanted to be in the front, especially the British people). The performance was therefore very disappointing musically, and non-musically.
Osip Mandelstam's continuing hold over readers far from his homeland is shown by the publication of a new book of English-language translations of his work. In a review of Ecco Press' Stolen Air: Selected Poems of Osip Mandelstam for the Washington Post, Michael Dirda quotes Mandelstam's claim that 'Only in Russia' is poetry properly 'respected', because only in Russia is poetry 'so common a motive for murder'. Borges might have smiled sadly at that piece of irony.
Now consider it this way. What if you consider this statement on relativity to be all-encompassing? Before going any further, simply by taking such a stance, you have already asserted belief in an absolute truth–that everything is relative. This alone proves your theory dead that there is no such thing as universal truth.
So I cannot equate the pain that homosexuals in our communities endure to the effect that homophobia has upon heterosexuals, but I can explain the loss that occurs for our society of heterosexual men during times they have been bound in fear by being labeled as gay men. Hopefully we will agree to do away with this regressive attitude completely for the benefit of all men.

When we were fairly close to our destination we passed many pineapple plantations, and as we dropped closer to sea level we noticed other plantations in the distance, we just could not work out what the trees were! Eventually we came to a tarmac road! Hurrah, smooth travel again. We were soon going through these other mysterious plantations. There they were, miles, and miles of palm trees bearing fruits for palm oil; amazing to see. The only time I have heard of palm oil is its use is in a certain soap, how my knowledge has grown!
What I would love is only have to work part-time to pay my bills. Then I would have more time to write, and would still be keeping the pressure of payday away from my art. At this stage in my financial lifecycle, I can’t even begin to consider part-time work, but I’m planning for it. I’m aligning my finances so that I can retire from full-time work. Not in the next year or two, but not too far from now, either. I hear some of you out there making those little tutt-tutt noises, those noises that indicate I can only choose to do that because I’ll be living off of Mr. Aniko, how lucky for me! Not true, ya’ll. Not that he wouldn’t do that and hasn’t already offered, either. The fact is, I want to be totally debt-free (including the mortgage), have a decent retirement fund being actively managed, and know that even if Mr. Aniko had to fly offworld and leave me behind, I could pay for everything I require and still not have to worry about my future, old-lady monetary needs. I want to help us build a stronger, more financially secure future where one or both of us could decide to work part-time and still have money to buy good food and comfortable shoes. I want that security, even if it means I have to wait a bit to pursue my Dream Job. Even if I have to put a price on my books – a fair price, but still a price. Even if it means that I keep writing in the pre-dawn dark, hours before I go to my Job. Write on the weekends, instead of hosting parties. Write when I’m tired, cold, or nervous about a meeting. It’s not easy to balance the writing with the working with the living. But I do it because it is what I have to do. I work for money, but I write to live.
The earliest film in the collection, Goryeojang features superb B&W lensing and outstanding performances. A woman arrives with her sole surviving son (Guryong) to a village in order to marry a man with ten sons by four previous marriages (yes, I’m not making this up!). The village is beset by recurring famines and has an unfortunate tradition of sending its elderly to the Sacred Peak to die (apparently, abstinence was not an option). The village shaman, scorned by the groom, places a curse on his ten sons. Shortly after their wedding, the sons play a cruel trick on Guryong and he is maimed for life. The woman leaves her husband to live with her son on a plot of land he has given her. The years go by, and the bitter rivalry between the ten sons intensifies when they learn of Guryong’s impending wedding. Shortly after his wedding, tragedy strikes and he is alone again with his aging mother. Many more years pass when a prolonged drought pits the brothers, who own the sole well in the village, against Guryong, who has been using his supply of food to extort land from all the villagers.

This was my first week at work, even though It was our second week here. Our first week here we were blessed to be given the freedom to look for a place to live. Our prayers were answered and we signed the lease for an apartment in Lancaster city. The apartment is actually really neat. It's a detached converted carriage house behind an old victorian mansion. It's a 2 bedroom 1 bath and the entire living space is on what would be a second story. The "basement" is on the first floor and is actually the entry way that leads to the stairs that go up to the living quarters (photos coming soon to make up for my not so clear description). Anyway..

If you believe that Ratzinger himself did not order the cessation, if you believe that Ratzinger himself was not complicit in the cover up, if you believe that he is “a man of immense compassion and goodness”, then I say that you are so wrong that it is hard to find words to describe your gullibility and sheer foolishness. And if you happen to be Cardinal Pell, then I question whether you have any moral authority left. And I certainly question why The Australian, or any other newspaper, should be giving you space to mouth your increasingly flimsy and silly excuses for Ratzinger’s behaviour.
I disagree. I think people can actively promote evil, even when they do not intend to. For example, this letter contains a number of nasty, erroneous claims (I have to work hard not to call them “lies,” but I’ll wager Pritchett just doesn’t know better; I can’t pass judgment on his motives).

It was the fall of 1906 and Sophie was about to commit a most unnatural act. Telling her folks she was going to take a few days vacation in New Haven (that should have been the tip off), she abandoned her son to be raised by her family and ran off to New York. Not that it’s an excuse (and only in a book on show business could one find an excuse for child abandonment in pursuit of fame and fortune), but she was a mere slip (okay, ox) of nineteen at the time.

This is still very early days and due to the nature of the situation, both parties are looking to keep this underwraps as much as possible, which I’m guessing it will be like that until a deal is agreed. But I’m sure you would agree that this is promising and a massive turn of events in what has been a very bleak 24 hours prior to this morning. All we can do as players now, is just sit back and hope that this deal works out and we finally get our funds back. I think we deserve that. Even if this is sorted, i have a bad feeling that FullTilt’s name will have been tarnished through the unprofessional way it treated it’s players, i think it’s fair to say they have a lot of work to do, not only to secure this deal, but to also earn the trust of it’s players again.

It has been one C-R-A-Z-Y week! What happened to me trying to post everyday??? This past week I had a graduate project due, I am teaching an enrichment class after school, our spring concert was Thursday night (which was fabulous - BTW) and my son's jr. prom was this weekend. Whew! I think the craziness is over but I begin a new class this week that already has tons of reading.... I'm not whining (ok, maybe just a little). Here was a little bit (actually A LOT) of our days last week:
One more thing. Almost every time I looked at the clock today I saw a 44. It was 11:44 when I checked the time at home and thought I really needed to bust into high gear if I was going to make it out of the house in time to do all I wanted to do. It was 12:44 when I checked the car clock after starting to drive. It was 1:44 when I was driving through Montrose and decided to call the kids. It was 2:44 when I got back into the car after getting some screaming deals at the Ridgway thrift store. I don’t remember if I saw 3:44, and definitely didn’t see 4:44, but it was exactly 5:44 when I borrowed the phone at the Ouray pool to call B and tell him I’d lost my glasses.
The difficulty of conveying taste with Zak Avery. I certainly struggle to describe flavours in beer at times, and seeing the poncy description on wines really turned me off wine (I just buy the 2nd cheapest, but wine tasting with Marstons has helped a bit). So I'm looking forward to this, not just to improve my own knowledge but I enjoy bringing customers with us in what we do. I'd love to think that the festival can get people thinking about ale in different ways, trying new things and so on.

During his enthronement as Archbishop of Westminster on 18 December 1943, the future Cardinal Bernard Griffin chose to preach on the sanctity of marriage. At the time, most Christian denominations in the UK had united their forces to fight what appeared to be a two-pronged attack on marriage – namely, the liberalisation of the divorce laws and the promotion of contraception.

It’s something else entirely: A true series perhaps?), but The Starchild, Starchild Duel, Starchild Crossfire, and Starchild Ruin will most likely only strike a balance between 300,000 and 400,000 words at the minimum when they are done.

As a result, the urbanisme, forced to take the complaint seriously, miserably slapped a PV on both other owners too, to submit regularization permits, or remove and restore. Cue a fine of 1000 euros each, for things they didn't even build themselves.

Since I got my new camera, a friend of mine who is a professional photographer, Liz Grandmaison (check out her own website here) has been a source of indispensable and patient advice, feedback, and recommendations for me. One day she posted some photos on Facebook from a trip she had taken. I noted the particularly rich, radiant blue sky in one of them and asked how she made that happen, guessing that I already knew the answer (and I was right): polarizing filters.
Inspired by the success of these routines, I added a Morning Pages routine, a salad-for-lunch routine, a walk-in-the-door routine, a tweeting-while-watching-football routine, a meditation-at-work routine, and an evening routine wherein I write a one-sentence journal, tweet my gratitude list, and put checkmarks on my resolution list. Each routine adds an anchor point, or perhaps a GPS waypoint, to my day. Each routine gives me comfort and enjoyment. And each routine contributes to a feeling of well being, a feeling that I am doing what I am supposed to be doing and taking care of me. I really think the Dalai Lama might be on to something here.

In my opinion, the best clients are those who are just getting their business started. They aren’t looking for a huge savings off their current policy (though, of course, they don’t want to pay a ton) and they are more likely to stay loyal to their agent (ever hear those business owners who say they’ve been with their current agent for 20 years?). But, the question is, how do you find people looking to start a business?
You could see the comic potential in the above plot synopsis, but what makes the movie so intense and traumatic is that each of the husbands has a truly sick quality: physically abusive, drug addict, sado-masochist, bigamist, sex addict, and attempted murderer. These are not sympathetic characters! It was actually a bit uncomfortable to watch some of these actors who we like so much (like Irrfan Khan and Nashruddin Shah) play such twisted roles. It’s not exactly uplifting when Priyanka Chopra’s character, with the assistance of her exceptionally loyal household servants, takes out each husband in turn, either. They are all caught in a very destructive pattern, and it’s not often easy to watch. The ending fits, but it also very strange, with one of the most bizarre dance numbers I’ve ever seen.
At this point in country, I had been informed by multiple sources that you should never, and I mean NEVER, sleep with the maid.

All of the Hynkel scenes are genuinely funny; they are bizarre, eviscerating, silly and smart, such as when Hynkel's propaganda man, "Garbage" (er, Goebbels), instructs Hynkel in the psychological warfare they intend to wreak on Napoloni to ensure the latter's feelings of inferiority. Napoloni's easy evasion of their tactics, such as putting him in a low-seated chair ("They've-a put me in-a the toddler chair!" Napoloni mutters), is whimsical and fun.
I sense that this vision is for everyone. God wants us to declare His promises. He wants us to ask Him so we can receive from Him. He wants us to stand upon the promises of God and declare them over our lives so we can start to receive from Him – all that He has for us.
It is so adorable. So soft and well made.
I woke up this morning just before dawn as the skies lost their grip on repression and gave in to a pouring rain as steady, even and pervasive as holding it all in had been up until the tipping point, which seemed both inevitable and mysterious, like its psychological equivalent.

The basic rationale for the existence of State Enterprises is they can be more effective because they are not bound by the strict rules which control the conventional civil service. The absence of those rules is supposed to allow more latitude in terms of hiring, borrowing and contracting. State Enterprises can hire professional staff at market rates, enter complex commercial arrangements and borrow on commercial terms, all of which should amount to significant improvements in public services.

I want to embrace all of you, the imperfect human that you are, as my human – my man.
Next I found some learned articles that stretched my own knowledge . It suggested that dandelions begin to close at about 11.00 am and by 1pm about 40% were closed. This seemed to contradict my observation yesterday that lots of dandelions were fully open at 4 pm. However, one observer had stated that free antithesis of dandelions occurred when temperatures were between 8 and 14 degrees C with maximum pollen presentation between 10 and 11 am. For apple blossom key temperatures were between 10 and 19 degrees C with max pollen presentation between 12.00 mid day and 4.00 pm.. This did seem to contrast with the fact the bees were coming in so very laden with dandelion much later in the day. It had been such a murky start to the day perhaps it delayed the time or the temperature trigger for maximum pollen?

God is never the origin of temptation. God has called us to a life of holiness. The Lord would rather see us take the path of holy subjection to His will and flee temptation. Jesus taught us to pray, “Lead us not into temptation.” That is, don’t leave us to go our own dangerous way which would expose us to pressures from the enemy of our souls.

I am of the considered opinion that whereas the Boer Nation can (even still today) do without the "Afrikaanse", the "Afrikaanse" cannot do without the Boer Nation and his land, minerals, economic activity, his energy and drive, etc., etc. Decades ago when I used to debate on the subject of secession from the greater South Africa and re-establishing the Boer Republics, the politically dimwitted would ask me how Transvaal (never say THE Transvaal!) could "go it alone" without seaports. Of course, they forget that Johannesburg is officially considered a port, and the SA Navy has its HQ in Pretoria. Also, these dimwits have never heard of aircraft, and the rest of the White Man's magic, that would make it child's play to not have a sea port. Also, who said anything about there being no co-operation between the Boer Republics and Cape Colony and Kwa Zulu (Natal), and, of course, Mozambique, They also forget that many other flourishing nations have land-locked countries -- for instance the Swiss, who have very little in the way of minerals and other commodities. But they do have White Man's brains! So, as I used to say to them, it is rather a case of whether the Cape Colony and Kwa Zulu (Natal) would remain viable for long if Transvaal and Orange Free State were to be re-established as sovereign countries; especially if no trade were to take place between these entities. The Cape Province with its wine, fruit and wheat culture; Kwa Zulu (Natal) with its sugar cane and a few bananas -- even with their ports, both would have to expand the rotten thing called tourism so as to survive. Transvaal alone has much more of everything than all the others combined! And you have to see the maize (corn to Americans) farms of Orange Free State -- it makes Oklahoma corn look like a child's sand pit.

All this relates to the physical signs of an approaching great crisis, the end of the modern age, and perhaps the end of the world itself. But much more remarkable than these are the spiritual signs that are multiplying in our times. This is what I would like to mostly talk about.

Running along the track wasn’t as easy as I thought. There were moderate inclines, but proved to be a good warm-up before we headed for the paddock access and continued covering 5 loops (of about 6 km each) on the main road outside the circuit. At certain areas, it was completely dark, if not for the organizer who had thoughtfully placed a few human torchlights (cum supporters) to guide the runners. To be fair, we were given headlights to wear but I’m sure many, like myself, wouldn’t like to have extra weight on our heads when we run a full marathon. But out of respect for the organizer, I decided bring along the headlight, but had it strapped to my arm instead.
The physical and mental preparation for the rigors of filming was decidedly different from that of a typical feature film. The six-seven year investment required Reitz to make drastic changes in his lifestyle. In addition to quitting smoking, he ended the nightlife and drinking associated with the film business and made certain to get enough sleep. He took part in more sports activities and bicycled whenever possible. In spite of the financial, logistical and artistic hurdles to overcome during filming, there is no strain evident in the picture. Reitz, intimately aware of the 100 years of cinematic history preceding him, eschews unnecessarily complicated scripts and innovation for its own sake. His theatrical background is evident in the superb writing, the exquisitely nuanced changes of tone, and the amazingly natural performances Reitz elicits from each and every one of his performers, professionally-trained or novice. Reflecting his respect for all his actors, there are no ‘secondary’ roles. In fact, for a filmmaker who has been at the forefront of the avant-garde, who has worked in theatre and experimental film, and who was among the first in Germany to recognize the expressive possibilities of the Web, Reitz’s film is surprisingly accessible, appealing both to the connoisseur as well as to the casual filmgoer. The end result being a work that defies categorization, but which recalls early Truffaut in its beauty, lyricism and grace.

There is no difference whatsoever between Proctor's position and the position of the Anti-Saloon League. Indeed, the Anti-Saloon League was more moderate in that they allowed alcohol to be sold under certain conditions (religious ceremonies, medical use etc.).

I recently came across something I wrote almost a year ago while living in DC for my final semester of college. Though some of the ideas are specific to my time and program in DC, I feel that the larger arguments were worth posting. I was happy to come across this article and be reminded of some of these things. Anyways, here she is:
So 6 handpumps for ale, 3 ever-changing guest and 4 stillages to service those pumps. So although this bank holiday, as a perfect example, saw the bar loaded with 6 ales, a scrumpy and a perry on hand-pump ready to go, I could replace one guest ale immediately after it sold out, but the 2nd one to run out left me with an empty pump for a day and a half whilst I waited for the new ale to drop bright.
I couldn't swim either, but I took hold of my father's hand, and he led me along the sand to where the wetness began, squeezing my knuckles together until the bones rolled against each other and hurt. I didn't say a word because complaints usually caused him to decide to play rougher, squeezing my pinkie finger into a little white swirl and rolling it into a knot until I began to cry and he began to laugh. Being good meant no whining, and that was not always easy to achieve with my parents.

But scratch the surface in Trinidad today, and you’ll find a whole slew of rum songs, many recent variations of a popular hybrid Subcontinent-goes-Soca style called “chutney.” (About forty percent of the population of Trinidad is of Indian descent.) An article on the subject recently ran in the Trinidad and Tobago Express under the headline “Rum and chutney the latest Carnival drink.” (Having made cocktails using rum and raspberry preserves recently, my first thought was, “Well, this sounds interesting!” Then I clicked and remembered. oh, yeah, chutney, the music.)
The art style of this manga is simply great. I always like it when Japanese authors decide to break free from the usual conventions of manga styled drawings. The environment is drawn pretty good although there isn't much variation in locations but there are always a lot of details to look at (especially in the buildings). Some much needed breaks from the usual routine every now and then happen so it does not get tedious. In general the art is simplistic, especially when it comes to facial features. Somehow the characters don't look very Japanese because of it. Speaking of characters most of the are characterized fairly good. Some are predictable but still likeable while other more focused characters have a lot of things going for them. Throw in a little philosophy in it and you have a very nice read.

Pride & Prejudice & Zombies had not been released yet. I didn’t know a thing about that novel and how successful it would be, but Austen stuff has been hot for a while and since this had that feel, I wanted to highlight it as a selling point. Thus the last line.

Christopher Magiera is a fine and believable Captain, thinking on his feet, especially touching in the scene where Mamoud (the eloquent baritone Richard Burkhard), a dead ringer for Kevin Kline in A Fish Called Wanda, opens up overnight and tells him his own story - an incident based, like many of the opera's scenes, on the captain's memoirs, extracts of which you can read in the programme. Superb vignettes by Kathryn Harries as the Austrian woman who describes locking herself in her bathroom and escaping unnoticed, all of it a first-rate take-off of Pierrot Lunaire sprechstimme; and by Clare Presland as the Palestinian Woman, implicitly Omar's mother, intensity suffusing every blazing note.

I’ve heard the term “natural grace” used to describe different things, birds and animals and dancers. A horse galloping in a field epitomizes “natural grace.” The horse striding powerfully on the ground with hooves thundering and its mane and tail fanned out in the air. I guess you could call me a horse lover. I know from experience that can have their ornery moments. Don’t we all have ornery moments, so why shouldn’t they be allowed a few.
I know that Elisha was praying it for his servant when his servant thought all was hopeless. Elisha knew that the Lord was with him. It took a prayer from Elisha asking God to open the eyes of his servant before his servant saw what he saw.

One summer afternoon, I’d made my usual pilgrimage to Morgan Self Books to get some more back issues of comics. Typically, I’d browse through the bins, pick out a few, add them up and see if I had any extra cash to maybe pick up a paperback or two. This time, I did. And there was this book at sort of intrigued me, primarily because it only had a painting of a woman’s face on the cover. No title, no author. Only the words, “A novel of a girl possessed of a terrifying power.” I’d never seen that before.

Simone brought me bread and red wine in a charming bottle that was set in a basket which emphasized that I was in Italy. More basket-bottles were hanging from the ceiling. A pair of old women in the corner were tucking into their first course: roast chicken. While eating, they sipped on white wine that they had mixed with aqua frizzante to make a spritzer.
I just started reading two new books that I was really interested to read: Crossed by Ally Condie, the sequel to Matched. I really enjoyed the first book, just short of giving it 5 stars, which is still debatable because I really liked it! I’m always wary of sequels - especially if I liked the first book a lot – because of course, a sequel is always different and sometimes they take me to places I don’t expect. I’m only a few chapters into it right now so I’m optimistic and interested to see where the story will take me from here!
The next time you are walking the streets, the parking lot of a store, or throughout the park, I dare you to stop and pick up at least one piece of trash instead of stepping over it.

My impression, then, of the lives of women at this time is that women were expected to submit to male authority, behave with modesty and decorum, and serve with hospitality as part of running a good household. They were not expected to take up authority themselves, abandon or neglect their duties, or behave or dress indecently.

What’s more, for equestrian students, Stoneleigh-Burnham’s riding program is top-notch and they boast a phenomenal cross-country course right on site. (As a result, they host a wide variety of horse trials in addition to the typical New England hunter/jumper shows and prerequisite IEA team meets.) It’s always important to me in examining high school programs that the possibility of IEA competition is available to students, as well as outside competitions if they are so adventuresome. And upon my recent visit, I learned that the riding program has just received a donation of a brand new truck and trailer to get them to shows, so the Stoneleigh girls and their horses will be traveling in style.
We singles are all looking for that starburst of wonder and goodwill, elusive as it might be. There's no way to pre-figure the feeling, the chemistry follows no particular rules. Encounters with this drug are not restricted to singles either - I can think of at least three married women with whom I've shared that moment of singularity, of knowing. Fortunately, my better nature prevented anything more happening. There are quite a few what-ifs hanging out there in the universe.
In its concern with language as a vehicle for supernatural manifestation and/or mental breakdown (as usual with Campbell, the boundaries between the two are far from clear), The Grin of the Dark also resembles such stories as "End of the Line", "McGonagall in the Head" and "Becoming Visible". Like the last of those tales, and like Campbell's outstanding novella Needing Ghosts, it makes effective use of the present tense: a horror story told in the past tense holds at least the implicit comfort that it's all over by the time you read it, but The Grin of the Dark carries the clear implication that what happens to Simon Lester not only could happen, but is already happening, to the rest of us.

In my late teens and early twenties I became an expert quitter. After three months of a Science degree I quit. After a year of Art School I quit. After three months of a stone masonry job I used the mass redundancy from the site we were working on as an opportunity to quit. I’ve quit good administration jobs and I’ve quit whole ‘scenes’ – you know, where you just accept that you don’t like the culture that you’re in. There have been countless other examples. I’ve quit for a variety of reasons. Sometimes I’ve just realised that I was simply taking someone else’s path rather than my own. Most often it was just because my heart wasn’t in it, even if I was very good at it. In my experience being good at something is no guarantee that it’s the best way forward. It can be, but not necessarily.
Excursions further afield can be arranged in the week.

The moon has been looking different lately, and at the September 1945 meeting of the society, the chairman has some top secret information to impart to the privileged and esteemed members – the moon is falling towards the earth and they mustn’t tell anyone. Hopkins, who is a rather self-important fellow, is shocked and pleased in equal measure. He feels it his duty to carry on life as normal, but ere long it becomes obvious even to the man in the street, that the moon is getting nearer and the Government lifts the embargo on the press.
This weekend’s plans include planting carrot and sunflower seeds directly in the garden and hopefully spreading some grass seed in some of the patchy dirt areas of the lawn. Last springs ‘more grass in the shady back lawn’ project (I really suck at naming projects) seems to have taken, as there is much more nice lush grass back there and only a few bare patches. That is pretty much a direct turn around from the bare patches with small tufty grass mounds of last year, so yay for us. The giant pine tree didn’t kill nearly as much of the new grass as anticipated. Probably mostly because I swept the fallen needles off of it pretty much as soon as they fell. I’m not sure which genus of evergreen tree ours is but either way, it’s one of the only evergreens I’ve ever seen that drops tons of needles in the fall. Evergreen my ass.

Within a week of her move-in, we were dating. I wasn’t exactly subtle. But I knew that she was single, and I felt if I was to have a hope with her, I needed to act quickly. I wasn’t overbearing; above all, I respected her privacy. I just gave out little signals of interest and slowly drew her in to my life. She jokingly called me “Spiderman” for the way I cast the web that brought us together.

I’ve been reading this book called The Expectant Father. A lot of people seemed to recommend it, and there really aren’t a whole lot of baby books out there I’ve seen that are actually geared toward dads and how to prepare for a baby. Because, let’s face it, we’re not doing a whole lot of the work—aside from general fetching of things and talking to the baby, this is a process that’s completely out of our hands. I wanted to try to find something productive to do with the time that will actually help me be a decent dad.

I thought the smartest thing to do was to enter the nearest taxi to get to the bus station. All I can say is, I was screwed by Murpjy's Law again. I began running back towards the station in desperate hope of finding a taxi on the way. About 5 taxis went past me but all were occupied, "FUCK!" I ran about a quarter of the way when I saw someone get off a taxi by the side of the road. I sprinted towards that taxi and got in. I had 15 minutes left.

After getting past the acid, some nice fruit (mostly citrus) and the faintest indication of oak. Once the acidity mellows a bit, this will be a blockbuster. Outstanding. 92 points.

Tony and I met Melissa and Lucy back in 2003 with other Fodories. I told Melissa I would like to meet at Tiki’s. Love the place and the food. She made the arrangements with the marketing manager, got us a nice table, complimentary parking for 3 hours (which was the right amount of time) and we had a great time. We received complimentary pupu’s: Kalbi beef gyoza, ahi-tuna spread with toast, and edamame that was coated in a decadent white truffle oil. The edamame was so good that some of us used the empty edamame shells and toast to sop up the oil. The gyoza and tuna tartar was also delicious.

When he broke with the Socialist party in 1914, it was over whether or not Italy should enter World War I. Following Marx's internationalist doctrines, the "Socialist" (Marxist) party was neutralist and anti-patriotic but Mussolini soon became uncomfortable with that for two reasons: 1). It had already become fairly clear even before the war that the workers were nationalistic and patriotic rather than class-conscious -- so the Marxist vision of the workers of the world uniting regardless of nationality was just not going to happen. And all that was thoroughly confirmed when the mainstream Leftist parties of the various European countries lined up behind their respective national governments in World War I. So it was nationalism and patriotism rather than class-struggle that would most move the workers. And, as the aspiring leader of the workers, Mussolini had to follow that! 2). Mussolini correctly foresaw that the Austro/German forces would not win the war and therefore wanted Italy to join the Allied side and thus get a slice of Austrian territory at the end of the war. Italians had suffered many humiliations at the hands of the Austrians and there must have been very few Italians who did not share Mussolini's desire to seize historically Italian territory from them. Like many Leftists then and since Mussolini did not have any principles that he allowed to stand in the way of a grab for power.

Clooney received the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama and is Oscar-nominated for his strong performance. The film is nominated for Best Picture.
It's not a subject I have ever discussed with Mrs Blunt. She is of the 'You Take What You're Given, And Be Grateful For It' school of thought. As my experience of women other than Mrs Blunt is rather limited (and my tryst with that kiss-and-tell bimbo, Miss Jennifer Muffin, some twenty-odd years ago is not to be counted, for these purposes) I cannot know whether my endowment is either more or less than that of the average man.

The heart is the emotion: the melody and harmony, the shape and feeling of the song. The brain is the insight: the part that makes you think, usually it’s conveyed in the lyrics, but sometimes with fancy chord voicings or time signatures. The body is the physicality of the song: the rhythm, the primal, erotic force that makes you want to get up and dance.

More than anything, Luminato is a celebration of creativity. Toronto’s rich cultural and ethnic landscape is fertile ground for a festival with an eye on both the past and the future. This year’s Festival looks at seismic shifts, revolutions and transformations that have rippled through history in tandem with groundbreaking artistic innovations. These historic shifts will be examined from various perspectives, from literature to music to the visual arts.
Estimates of post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury vary widely, but a ballpark figure is that the problems afflict at least one in five veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq. One study found that by their third or fourth tours in Iraq or Afghanistan, more than one-quarter of soldiers had such mental health problems.

As the housekeeper fussed with the fire, Eulogy fought the discomfort Huntley stirred in her. His voice resonated deep in her body, and when he smiled she wanted to stare, to drink in that strong face, so masculine with its angles and planes, and yet somehow vulnerable.

The thing I love most about vintage typewriters has to be, hands down, that satisfying ding of the return bell ... The sound alone conjurs up so many great images from the past ... busy, chattering newsrooms before deadline, an oak-paneled college library filled with co-eds and coffee ... or my favorite, a sweetheart carefully typing out a secret love letter to his beautiful bride-to-be.

We finished our first release performance with success. Almost 250 people came to the performance. Because the club was small, it was uncomfortable and there were so many people that the sound didn't come out as it should. ^^ We think like that it was a start you just have to be satisfied with. Still, compared to the warm reaction of the beginning, it lacked a bit, but we will work hard to wait cheerfully. If we made good music then the appreciating people will appear. If not, then we have to be hard working and make a 2nd album with new songs. ^^

In that situation they were all priests and there was a dozen of them. In our situation we have several dozen people all drinking from the same cup. To me it appears that respect for Christ is less apparent because everyone can go up and drink, mixing in their saliva, lip gloss, skin particles etc. To me this is not respectful at all – but this is my opinion and to me it makes sense.

The soldier in this story is Dan Riley – a major in the British Army. He has just returned home after a six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan. His wife, Alexa, has been left caring for twin toddler daughters and Isabel, her twelve-year-old daughter from her first marriage. The story is told from the point-of-view of Dan, Alexa and Isabel – as well as an assortment of other family members.

Is your area plagued by drought and desertification? Is the local aquifer steadily depleting? Did you have endless days of 115°F heat last summer? Are you worried about food security? Maybe your region’s lands have suffered from declining rainfall or salinization. I have some truly good news for you. Growing soil with high stable humus content is the healing treatment for all these ills.
The Cyber Parent is ultra-plugged in and yet, ultra-wireless. Everyone in the family blogs. Little Jimmy has been building websites since he was 7. Little Suzie runs around with a plastic cellphone like some kind of miniature, corporate, a-hole. The family often comes together around electronic devices whether they are gathering around a Skype call – as they watch daddy at a tech conference – or standing in the Brookstones Store trying on Google’s new internet glasses. Yep, they’ll be the very first family to try out that prototype like a high-tech Loud family. Each member in his or her own internet glasses that allow you to take your laptop screen literally everywhere with you, about a centimeter from your face, as they blissfully bump into every last goddamned thing. Bruised, but updated and happy. The Cyber family led by Cyber parents can often be overhead repeating the same mantra again and again, “Oh, that’s so cool, that’s so cool, that’s so cool.”

the water regulator, paid Rob Ashley, interim director of policy and communications between 2009 and 2011, £475,000 through an agency. He also has his own consultancy, Robert Ashley Ltd. How are these practices condoned by the very same people who insist that those at the bottom of the food chain in Britain are pursued for economic crimes, because lets not mince words, these very uncivil servants are committing crimes against those who pay their very inflated wages. If the current government were not spineless, these practices would be stamped out Tuesday morning.

In a large bowl, use a balloon whisk to thoroughly combine egg whites, water, orange extract, and cream of tartar. After 2 minutes, switch to a hand mixer. Slowly sift the reserved sugar, beating continuously at medium speed. Once you have achieved medium peaks, sift enough of the flour mixture in to dust the top of the foam. Using a spatula fold in gently. Continue until all of the flour mixture is incorporated.

For the record, and for those wondering, yes, I had meant for this piece to be a bit of a review of the beers we shared at this particular Beer Blokes Tasting and something of a plug for the Beer Blokes Tastings but on the night I realised that that there were many parallels between our beer journies and our other more educational ones.
(For example, a typical 4 minute song on a CD requires 40 MB of data. However, an mp3 file of that same song can be less than 4 MB -- containing less than one-tenth of the audio data on the CD. Even a higher quality mp3 of that same song is only about 6 or 7 MB -- still only about one-sixth of the audio data on the CD.)

We are calling down judgement upon ourselves, our families, our communities and our nations, by our actions and, even more, by our inaction in the face of both error and need – great need. However, we continue refusing to acknowledge what is occurring, even though we know; deep down, we know that this is not a game, but tangible reality. When are we going to allow Love therefore – true love – to warm up our miserly hearts? The longer we delay in changing ourselves, the more Our Father’s righteous judgments will increase. Is this the way we want to go? Is this what we really want? The decision is ours to make. Our Father has more than done His part; it is time we do ours.

The movie has been criticized negatively because of the reasons aforementioned a lot of times, however, and this article is not going to bash the movie any further. The 2012 movie, inconsistencies aside, is a plausible and genuine outlook of the future should the date of destruction, December 21, 2012, comes. It mashes up all the general theories regarding 2012, and presents possible outcomes and solutions to save not only humanity, but its virtues and its long-recorded history. Here is a list of what happened in the 2012 movie that could also happen in the real 2012 apocalypse.

I really wish I could say this has been our little miracle for Ayden, but that just isn't the case so far. I do think it has helped him in the month he's been on it, but it hasn't been as effective as I've heard with other FX kids. The good things we're seeing still include him attempting to communicate more and better. He is still pushing limits when it comes to using PECS and finding new and creative ways to tell us what he wants. He is still playing with toys the way they were meant to be played with sometimes - though spinning continues to be one of his favorite past times. We are also still seeing his fixation on certain toys much less. All of these are great things for Ayden, but we were just hoping for more.

This argument is fine, in so far as it goes. The problem is that it doesn’t go far enough. While it might be true that, if we’re interested in harm prevention, we ought to try to prevent harm and not just step in after it occurs, this doesn’t say anything about whether we should hold someone liable for attempting a crime. In other words, the argument fails to answer the question: why can’t we just prevent the crime and leave it at that (without punishing the attempt)?

Sara gets a text from her friend who she’s living with, who is also the same woman Rebecca was hitting on at the nightclub, telling her to come to the apartment. There, she and Rebecca end up in a hilariously over the top shouting match in which Rebecca shouts at Sara for not appreciating her wonderful attempts at friendship like killing Sara's cat and ex-boyfriend…see what I mean? This movie is the cutting edge of ludicrous, bizarre comedy. It's almost like some kind of weird black indie comedy or something. It's nice to see the movie playing around with genre conventions a bit and giving us at least something new.
Originally I named these Samincha ” which means blessed in Quechua, because that is how I feel when I wear them but my best friend had other ideas.

Bottom line: publishing a blog post that states opinion about a public figure or their stupid book is NOT bullying, defamation, slander or libel (as any attorney – or even paralegal – worth their salt would know). Bullying consists of aggressive behavior and an imbalance in power; defamation, slander and libel all consist of FALSE statements that the statement maker knows to be false and makes anyway with the intent to harm someone’s reputation and/or business opportunities.

On the 6" side, I scored a 1/2" to make a flap for adhering the pocket together. On the 9 1/2" side, I scored at 4 1/4" from one end and 1" from the other. This will make an A2 pocket card.

Chapter 1, "Cognitive Class and Education, 1900-1990," gives some information that I find highly interesting. The authors point out that from 1900-1990 there was a fifteen-fold increase in the proportion of people getting college degrees, and that students wishing to enter college were being more effectively selected for high IQ. They also mention that "Starting in the 1950s, a handful of institutions became magnets for the very brightest of each year's new class. In these schools, the cognitive level of the students rose far above the rest of the college population." (p. 29) They show with graphs (which one needs the smattering of statistics to interpret for oneself) that:

"Job hopping" by scientists and engineers is an important channel for knowledge diffusion. Little is known, however, about the effectiveness of actions firms take to reduce the outward flow of know-how and talent from their own organizations. Building on theories of reputation-building and strategic deterrence, this study investigates the moderating effects of corporate reputations for "toughness" in the enforcement of patents. Drawing on a unique database of enforcement activity, inter-firm inventor mobility events, and patent citations in the U.S. semiconductor industry, we find that a firm's litigiousness significantly curtails the dissemination of knowledge anticipated from employee departures, particularly to firms that are relatively disadvantaged to fund or withstand a legal dispute (i.e., that are small, young, or private). The overall effects are similar in magnitude for California-based

Libraries, like everything else, have evolved through the years. The library I use now is bright and airy. It is geared toward welcoming children, not intimidating them. The nondescript flooring absorbs noise rather than resonating sounds. Metal bookshelves replaced wood. Computers replaced the card catalog. Librarians look like everyone else and usually have a smile on their faces. I haven’t heard anyone “shushed” in years.

Danielle was only 26 when she died, which I think it makes it harder for everyone to believe it. So far all I know is that when she passed she had pneumonia. She went into cardiac arrest at the hospital, and they couldn’t revive her. She was a proud member of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. She danced all her life, and in my eyes she was great. I looked up to her, and I wanted to be like her. She was nice to everyone, and had a great personality. She’s a college graduate from High Point University, but was going to back for a second Bachelors in Nursing. The saddest thing about her passing is she’s my Aunts only child. I pray for strength for everyone because this is a hard loss for the world. Just remember, have faith and we will overcome every struggle.
“Elitists veil their agenda with the humanitarian rhetoric of the need to naturally reduce world population by means of contraception and education, whereas in reality, as we have exhaustively documented, their program has its origins in the inhumane pseudo-science of eugenics which first flourished in Britain, and the ideology of racial and genetic superiority that was later adopted by the Nazis with the aid of Rockefeller funding.”

私は走る事が好きではありません。友人で10キロ、ハーフマラソン、フルマラソンに参加する人が結構いて、彼女達からとても感化されますし刺激を受けます。でも、私自身長距離レースをしたいかと言うと、あまり興味がありませんでした。でもこちらの友人に、12月にレースに出ないかと言われ、参加してみることにしました。レースには様々な距離があり、最初10キロレースに出ようと思っていたのですが、今の状態だと10キロ走れるか分かりません。他の理由もあるのですが、今回は言及しませんね。4ヶ月訓練する時間がありますが、今のところ3キロと短い距離を走っているだけで満足です。私にとって走るのは簡単ではないのですが、いずれもう少し長い距離を走れるようになれたら良いなと夢見ています。
When I recorded The Midwife in my LibraryThing list, I was thrilled to see that it is the first of a trilogy! It is followed by Shadows of the Workhouse and Farewell to the East End. These books will be approached with caution, as it is always difficult when the first book isn’t nearly as good as the second or third. I didn’t find the second or third books in my library, so I promptly purchased them (an unusual activity for me).

Because of a persistent and irritating cough and my need to clear my throat frequently when lecturing, my local doctor in Howick had decided five or six years earlier that I was a "closet asthmatic''; I had subtle asthma, asthma not readily traceable from the standard lung function tests available at that time. To this day I don't know if I was, am or ever have been asthmatic and the respiratory specialists I have seen seem equally uncertain. No matter. Although my doctor had prescribed regular use of an inhaled steroid, I was becoming progressively more breathless with exertion and beginning to think if this went on I would need to hire a golf cart rather than trundle my clubs around the course. When your health is threatening your golf it's time to do something!
Six years ago I was encouraged by a staff person at an organization for parents to facilitate a support group for parents and care givers of persons with Fragile X Syndrome, the disorder my son was diagnosed with. I put together resource materials, started a Yahoo Group for the Support Group, bought folders, created stickers, brochures and flyers and scheduled monthly meetings, but no one attended.

We'll be told that Elizabeth Edward's cancer will give John Edwards some sympathetic attention. Does it give him a shot? Watch the belt buckle. I see a man who still polls very high negative numbers, and compared to the other "front runners" he's not having much luck building a war chest even though he's been running for president since he came to the Senate in 1998. He's going to the turf for a loss of 3 yards.

We started by visiting the Spencer Museum of Art on the campus of KU. I thought maybe we'd be cool enough to blend in and look like students. I think there was a freshman orientation or perspective student visit going on though, and we had no shot of looking like a frosh. Being aged aside, we saw some really cool pieces in the museum.

This isn't a new phenomenon. Other failed Republicans, seeking to curry favor with the liberal media or the Democrat powers-that-be, begin to talk like Democrats. They repeat Democrat talking points as if they were great insights and true wisdom. Colin Powell is a case in point. Both of them agree with Meghan McCain, a really airhead blonde and daughter of another failed Republican, John McCain: in order for the GOP to win elections, it must become a carbon-copy of the Democrats. I disagree.
I potted some flowers with my brown thumb. I am really trying to learn more about gardening and keep some plants alive longer than 1 month. I also started working on my porch renovation. One rocking chair is now high gloss white (it was black before). Took a few more cans of spray paint than I thought, but I love the look. Glossy white looks good on everything.

So what would I spend it on, you ask? Well, that’s kind of a personal question, but all right. My needs are pretty simple these days. A place to sleep, enough to eat and the clothes on my back. A laptop, a wifi connection and an outlet to charge my batteries. And good people to share good times with. But that’s the one thing money can’t buy.

The game’s system has, however, two very specific instances where player choice is essential. The most obvious one is what each figure does with its allocated actions. This happens in most every game and we will deal with it a bit later. The other one is more important and a big part of the game. A player can freely choose how many activation dice to roll, from 1 to 3. The more succesful rolls the more actions the figure has. But two or more failures mean the turn passes to the opponent. You can see this game is pretty hectic and when playing solitaire it has a life of its own.

All of sudden Emily wanted to be awake in the middle of the night. Sleep was only optional.

The No pile was for unanimous negative response from all five judges. If one of us loved it, it was put in Maybes. It is not breaking any confidences to say that Unhooking the Moon went straight into the Yes pile from the beginning.
For Noys, optimistic and affirmationist depictions of a parasitical capitalism that can be shrugged off through the assertion of collective, constitutive power ‘ontologise resistance’, leaving it ‘vulnerable to the cunning of capitalist reason’ (xi). His consequent attempt to link negativity to themes of agency and strategy seems pertinent, and by presenting it through a critique of affirmationism’s key figures (Noys selects Derrida, Deleuze, Latour, Negri and Badiou) the book makes a significant intervention into contemporary debate. Noys’ claims as to the need for such a negativity are persuasive, and the manner in which he supports them through the book’s critical interpretations of its selected theorists is particularly impressive. The virtues of actually extracting that negativity from affirmationist theory itself – a move that rests on Noys’ contention that contemporary capitalism should be understood in terms of real abstraction – do however invite a little more scepticism, as the task of locating ‘the neuralgic points of capitalism’ (171) might seem to imply a critique of political economy rather than a critique of Continental theory. Yet as for Noys real abstraction has rendered capitalism an ‘ontological, metaphysical and philosophical form’ (173), affirmationism’s tendency to present political resistance in terms of what he refers to as ‘counter-ontology’ (10) are of obvious interest: for affirmationism’s emphasis on productivity and creativity entails that its counter-ontology can mirror the ontology of capitalism itself (Noys draws attention here to the free flow of capital, the so-called creative industries, etc.), and whilst he does not present a simple ‘isomorphism’ (11) between affirmationist theory and capital, he does indicate that a critique of the former might offer purchase on the latter. This tactic seems to be much informed by the book’s contention that basing critique and opposition on a purportedly authentic position located outside or beneath capital’s appearances is a ‘naïveté’ (85), and that one should instead ‘work on and against’ (10) the abstractions that one finds oneself within.

Overall I'm quietly pleased with this Torchlight stuff. I've been lucky enough to assemble it at fairly reasonable cost and the overall simplicity of the rooms combined with the separate doors and accessories makes it very adaptable. You could argue that none of this is necessary for old school style play which should be achievable in the theatre of the mind, but I do like my toys ( its the wargamer in me showing through) and obviously someone thought there would be a market for this product when it first appeared in the mid eighties so it is at least contemporary with the other RPG stuff I'm using.
Most of our efforts were trying to keep our two daughters as quiet as we could as to not attract any more of these zombie like creatures towards our house, I need to make a run to the basement since a lot of our food that can last at ambient temperatures is down there.

The doppleganger for Guy in the second volume is Ivor Claire who is Guy’s model, an officer and a gentleman, quintessential England. However, as we discover through the novel is that the officers will not do their job and the gentlemen are no gentlemen at all. In the third volume, as part of Guy’s education, we will see where something totally disgraceful is perpetrated by these officers and they are not only not punished, but are rewarded.

I would imagine that the factual findings of the FTT will be adopted, whether pro or anti Rangers, by the SPL. As has been discussed on many occasions here and elsewhere, it is possible that the facts could exonerate RFC in terms of the tax case, but condemn them for SPL purposes. Of course the opposite is possible – a comprehensive victory for HMRC and clearance by the football authorities.
Thus it’s probably safe to assume that there will be no effective opposition to the status quo in this country until some movement arises that in practice—not just in theory—embraces an essentially ascetic approach. My guess, for what it’s worth, is that the first movement to do so will be a revived Marxism. I’m no fan of Karl Marx, and even less a fan of the various ideologues who filled out the framework of his system, but Marxism has features that will give it powerful appeal in the decades ahead. It gives the poor someone to blame for their misfortunes, and does so in a far more detailed manner than (say) the vague rhetoric of the Occupy movement; it is among the few ideologies that manage to fuse a rigorous intellectual tradition with a utopian future vision of religious intensity; and it has a strong ascetic element—the figure of the Marxist revolutionary, lean, passionate, doctrinaire, and contemptuous of material goods except insofar as they might help further the cause, was a common social type in Europe for close to a century.

Performing what can be best described as a weird form of interpretive dance, Catherine Ringer moves her body in a fashion that will be very familiar to fans of her work in the music videos for Les Rita Mitsouko, particularly the one for "C'est comme ça." When she's done pretending to molest this stone-faced mass of Euro-flesh, Martine "activates" them by touching their skin. During a moment of pure awkwardness, Martine activates her father by brushing her hand over his flaccid penis. Of course, no-one in attendance seems to think it's awkward, so I guess I'm just an incest prude. Either way, she's tasted their sexual essence, and is now ready to experience the real thing.
Do you know, this is our fourth year of trying to conceive? First started trying with the late May into June cycle in 2008, after that year's delay. God, how I've changed since then. How much has changed since then. I used to have hope, and now I despise it and cling to it simultaneously. I thought things were simple, straightforward then - that you had sex at the right time, got pregnant, and mostly had a baby. Now I know, in my primal being, that pregnancies don't last and babies don't live. Not for me, anyway. That if I ever do manage a viable pregnancy again, that if - I can't even picture it now - I ever have a living child, it will be because the universe wasn't watching closely enough, that I'll feel as if I've snuck one by. . . And still, angry as I get with it, I find so much beauty in the fragile world.
Arabic numbers are written from left to right, like in English. So when there is written Arabic text with numbers inserted into the text, the words read from right to left, but the numbers read the opposite way! Help!!! Plus some of the Arabic numbers are similar looking to English numbers, but some of those are totally different numbers. Interestingly enough, true Arabic numbers are what is used in the US. In Arabia, the numbers actually come from Hindu/Indian!

Then I headed to Idaho for one night of racing, then to Bend, Oregon, which gets us to the present day.

Once these three classes are over, I start spring semester classes. I have no idea how things will turn out, but I’m hoping I can continue this pattern and continue to do well. I want it so badly. I want to show the world that just because I have MS, I’m not brain-dead. I can actually remember my brother asking me what the point of me obtaining an education is when I won’t actually use it. I think there are probably a plethora of similar opinions out there, and I’m going to squash all those misconceptions. I guess I feel like I’m going back to school, not only for myself, but also for everyone who can’t because of MS.
Anastasia Steele once said this line. Looking back, I realized, that yes, I was alive that moment. Every moment with that lone and lost soul was a triumph for life.

You know, when we moved to AZ eight years ago the first summer was a relatively mild one. And our first winter back in MN is, so far, a very mild one also. Now maybe this is just a coincidence, but I like to think God cares about me so much that he is holding back icy winds and freezing temperatures just for me. :) Or maybe it's because he really doesn't want to hear my complaining about it... yes, that's more likely. At any rate, it really is wonderful, because when we lived here before (like, fifteen years ago) I had a really bad time with winter lasting from October thru March. No, March is not entirely snowy, however one can always expect a blizzard for the state basketball tournaments. So look. This winter is already three months shorter than others I have endured with less grace. God is just good to me and I appreciate it.

Projects, projects and more done. A couple of months ago I took one of our ugly brass lamps and gave it a new look. Then later I took another of our brass lamps and gave it a new look as well.

We all agreed that we like the black one best and the burgundy had to go. So makever two done on the burgundy lamp.

Natalie Portman is getting some rave reviews for her portrayal of Nina, a perfectionist, troubled ballerina who has revived the lead in a new production of “Swan Lake.” I have yet to see the movie myself yet, as it is only in limited release and will go in wide release on December 22. Mila Kunis also stars as Portman’s rival and understudy as well as French actor, Vincent Cassel. If you are a big fan of Darren Aronofsky’s work I am sure this psychological thriller will satisfy your needs. Expect Best Actress and possibly Supporting Actress, Best Director, and Best Picture nominations for this one.

The Republican Party appears to have decided to close ranks around ideas that are not only bad for the country, but dangerous for liberty. We have political leaders at both the state and federal level that are making bad laws or are attempting to pass bad laws which impede peoples rights and liberties in the name of social or religious good. These elected officials are obstructing the very laws passed, or amending laws for the express purpose of disenfranchising a citizen, a minority, and in some case the general population for whom they disagree.

I didn't want him on my lap, because it is dangerous to drive 15 miles on curvy roads with tiny shoulders with a child on your lap, but I wanted him where I could see him, so I decided to buckle him into the front seat. We started to drive, and his cries became whimpers and he said "Mom, I might die," and I said, "Son, no you won't, because your bleeding has stopped and you are going to be okay." He stopped crying then, and said he wanted to go to sleep, and I said I could understand that because then he wouldn't feel anything. And he asked if the doctors were going to be able to sew it back on, and I said yes, I think so, and then after a few moments of silence, he said in a soft voice, "I feel like I'm dying," and I looked over and he was reeling sideways, passing out. I grabbed his shoulder, and jerked him back up, and yelled "No, no, no! You can't go to sleep right now! You have to stay awake until we get to the hospital!"
Complications after delivery
Basked in it as long as it lasted.
Even threatened with - and delivered - a serious consequence involving an early bedtime and the loss of a favorite toy - for not minding me, she elected to wear the sweat jacket. I gave up, and remembered that I know something about this kind of disorder.

So there you have it, another embarrassing story from my childhood, and probably the only time I was involved in something actually close to a real fight. Outside of sparring in Tae-Kwon-Do class. Which I sucked at. Because I was so used to dodging, and I hated getting hit, I would never block, just dodge. My teacher did not like that all. But he still saw fit to give me a yellow belt. Oh well.
But I heard her loud and clear, and as much as I disliked her, the lesson stuck, and it got stickier with time.
I have been using Double Wear religiously, it's staying power is unbeatable. It can look a little cakey and of course causes serious Ghost Face. So how does it compare? Well the coverage is the same, you can either apply it as a concealer as in the youtube tutorial, or buff into the skin as with a normal foundation. It blends beautifully into the skin, you don't have to work as fast as you do with Double Wear. You can also build on the coverage easily without it going to cakey. Now the shade is a little darker than I am used to, however I have had more compliments on my skin looking healthier instead of being the same me colour as paper.
The following quotation best summarizes the enigma of missing US military high-level wastes. “The fission products and uranium and plutonium from spent fuel were reprocessed at chemical separation facilities in the States of Washington, Idaho, and South Carolina. This step in the production process generated approximately 385 million liters (100 million gallons) of highly radioactive and hazardous chemical waste. Some of this waste was discharged directly into the ground or stored in underground storage tanks. Some of the waste in underground storage subsequently leaked. This waste represents the vast majority of the radioactivity for which the Environmental Management program has responsibility. Many of the radioactive elements in this waste are long-lived and will pose risks to human health and the environment for tens of thousands of years. Contaminated facilities also have resulted from chemical separation.” (Vol. 1, pg. B-3). In view of this quotation, is William Wisenbaker correct in his assertion that the department has never used deep well injection to dispose of high-level radioactive wastes resulting from weapons manufacturing or reprocessing of spent fuel?

We had a bit of a rough start. After I got them from the shelter (they were about 4 months old at the time) they started ballooning up in their abdomen. I thought maybe they were just bloating from the higher quality food so I was tweaking it about a 100 different ways. However when I brought them to the vet, Lilah ended up puking 2 lovely, live, squiggling worms right on to the exam table. Makes for a definite diagnosis, but definitely not fun.
I want to live in a future where the big debates are something I can't even imagine today--the rights of ameobas, perhaps; or the comparative rights of martian colonists.

He’s since been reviled across the globe but continues to protest his innocence. I’m content to go with the authorities on this one given that they presumably have all the facts, but my thought was - all that heartache in the name of research?
I'm actually not a big fan of poetry. Most of it sounds like pretentious garbage to me. However, The Liverpool Scene surprises me a few times on this album, and I found myself actually digging it. They actually received a lot of criticism in their day for making poetry into pop - something more listenable and digestible for schleps like me. The Liverpool Scene was content that their poetry didn't begin with a capital P, but rather was not too distantly related to pop music (Gasp!) and could be enjoyed by your average teenager (the horror!).
I showed them pictures from Africa and China.
The assistant nodded and returned to his desk to call the duty pilot.
Nothing much has been happening lately. Not much inspiration, not much to do. Just lazy day after lazy day. I’m somewhat grateful for this, though, considering I have the privilege of lazing around.

Everyone is now well aware of the "fight" that has been going on between Anthony Bourdain and Paula Deen. Food lovers and TV lovers everywhere are sitting back and munching on the popcorn as this plays out. Armchair warriors for Team Tony and Team Paula are weighing in across the internet.

Once more, and to my relief, I entered Ayahuasca’s dimensions easily. As my head and extremities began to hum and vibrate with the powerful electric energy of the medicine, it grew in strength, then leveled off and remained a neon body buzz throughout the session. I saw some geometric patterns and some colors, but they were muted. Visual effects are easier to describe than other more internal effects, but now I noticed a different internal feel to this space from the previous ceremonies. The vine felt strong and it was deepening into me moment to moment. After some time, I was very deep, indeed, and I drifted on into another dimension.
I couldn't help but ask her how and why they got the tractor. It transpired that they have some trees to shift. As well as that, it's a top notch way to get to the pub. No camera I'm afraid, which is a crying shame, as I can't show you the kid on the tractor as I'd like to.
First, humans love to learn. From almost the moment a baby is born, they subconsciously begin trying to learn as much as possible so they can adapt to their new world. As they grow older, they learn how to get a parent's attention, how to act in order to get held or put down. They have an innate curiosity about almost everything they come into contact with, viewing the world through wide eyes and with open ears as they begin to categorize, classify and process all they come into contact with. Many people believe that this natural thirst for learning dissipates when they get into school, but I actually believe that is not the case; instead, I think that their interest in learning is simply conditioned and then redirected. The most disinterested student still likes to learn, they just enjoy learning things other than what is being taught to them. They quench their thirst in different ways, using TV, games, books, day dreams, and imaginative play as ways to re-engage their interest and hunger for new ideas and new ideals. This thirst for learning continues through college, into work and parenthood, and beyond. It may and should look different for different people, and we often do not have the time to learn formally, but the desire to learn and the joy that people derive from doing so never wanes; it's how we keep our brains from atrophy.
“Light” recurs with particular insistence: A “trick of the light” becomes “a squat of light” or more pointedly, “when you go… you leave part of yourself in the hallway, trapped in the afternoon’s half-light”. The unsubtle “love hurts” sentiment is transfigured into a delicate longing. The mindset of a protagonist during “visiting hour” is unsettled by “light”; saved by paradoxical obliquity: “I move from the room with the piercing light”. That “with” allows resistance to remain unoffered; to avoid being looked at directly one must move in the right direction. “Water” is another motif (“rain weeping from our sleeves”; “you leech into the water”; “nothing smells of you / it pelted with rain last night”). Liquid becomes a paradoxically stable way of expressing loss. These reiterated words all seem part of the grander scheme of, as the final line of the collection has it, “trying to catch myself, before I disappear from view”.

It was just last Sunday on CNN’s morning show “State of the Union” that host Candy Crowley asked Rep. Boehner if Mitt Romney’s wealth — much of it coming as a result of his job involving cutting people’s jobs with Bain Capital as one of its founders — would hurt him in voters’ minds as the GOP nominee for President.
Every creative journey begins with a problem. It starts with a feeling of frustration, the dull ache of not being able to find the answer. When we tell one another stories about creativity, we tend to leave out this phase of the creative process. We neglect to mention those days when we wanted to quit, when we believed that our problems were impossible to solve. Instead, we skip straight to the breakthroughs. The danger of telling this narrative is that the feeling of frustration – the act of being stumped – is an essential part of the creative process. Before we can find the answer – before we probably even know the question – we must be immersed in disappointment, convinced that a solution is beyond our reach. It's often only at this point, after we've stopped searching for the answer, that the answer arrives. All of a sudden, the answer to the problem that seemed so daunting becomes incredibly obvious.
Given the gravity of the incident and the IRA manpower involved in the ambushing of Breen and Buchanan, it is little short of astonishing that no SB50s, or MISRs, compiled in the aftermath of the incident have ever been presented to Judge Peter Smithwick.

This was followed by a leisurely stroll through the El Prado, a brief pause at the Spreckels Organ Pavilion for a free concert and finally, The House of Pacific Relations' International Cottages where there was a pre-St. Paddy's Day music & dance festival from the House of Ireland (along with a slew of other exhibits, performances and food/drink samples from the other houses.)
So when I called the therapist’s office today to schedule, they said that the next available appointment is NEXT FRIDAY. Oh my goodness, by then my back will be better!!

I’ll start with the differences. In all the other books, Rose and Lissa have been together, and if not at school – as is the case in Frostbite – they have always been with the students and the school authority figures. Not this time. Rose spends pretty much all of the book in Russia, away from school, away from anyone to reprimand her for breaking any rules – and there are no rules. She’s out in the world on her own, with only her training and her own idea of what’s sensible to guide her, and it’s great to see Rose going about things as she wants and she sees fit. It’s refreshing, but also worrying.
An entrepreneur’s lawyer, accountant, or marketing consultant may provide some level of support when a problem arises. But mentoring is about the big picture, not just the legal, accounting, or marketing piece of the puzzle. Mentors don’t sugarcoat anything and the dynamic that develops between the entrepreneur and the mentors is one of supportive criticism.

The three of us begin to make our way to where we parked the car, still having a grand time talking and laughing. The path we need to take leads us on a sidewalk right in front of a popular club that has a line of people waiting outside to get in. Right as we pass this line of people I hit one of those sections of sidewalk where one block of concrete is slightly raised above the one adjacent to it. Naturally, my shoe hit this quarter of an inch stumbling block and – SPLAT – down I go. I fell so hard and fast that I barely had time to catch myself with my hands before my chest and face reached the pavement. The position that I landed in kind of made it look like I had decided to do some push-ups – you know, the girl kind.
These thoughts can loop, go round and round, over and over. How lucky we are if this “broken record” thought is a positive one! What a struggle it is if it is a negative thought filled with worry, stress, anger or frustration. How horrible to have that noise chattering away inside our head all day long. We really could do without it!
I am starting massage therapy school tomorrow. THIS IS HUGE FOR ME. So you might recall that about this time last year I had a mini meltdown and sold all of my vintage stuff off in huge collections and virtually gave the rest away and quit the blog and went into a total hermetic state for a few months then came back in October and was talking all this sort of abstract, kind of ungrounded crazy talk, then retreated again until, like, a few weeks ago? Well, that's sort of what it might have looked like from here. And that is sort of what happened actually, but from where I am standing now, peering back over the year, A FEW HUNDRED SHIT TONS OF STUFF WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. I think I actually get the concept of alchemy now.

I toyed with putting this in the last category along with the other 3 worst movies I saw this year. I know it’s a strange choice, because Charlize Theron is good. Patton Oswalt is good. Patrick Wilson is good. All three of them are good. Jason Reitman is good (I think… though come to think of it, I also disliked the almost universally loved Juno). In any case, it’s difficult for a hoard of good actors to make a really detestable film, but they somehow managed to do it, while still putting in decemt performances. Especially Oswalt, who kicks total ass. For whatever reason, though, I couldn’t wait for this movie to end. I HATED the main character. (Like… you’re supposed to think she’s a bad person. I just couldn’t stand her). I didn’t understand why anyone tolerated her nonsense. I thought, for a brief moment at the end that the movie might be slightly redeemed. But no. I know that is part of the supposed charm of it… that she’s so unapologetically awful. But I feel like for that to work really, the character has to have some sort of likeable thing going on underneath where you don’t completely despise her. Fail. I don’t feel bad for her. I just hate her.

Sunday morning the swelling had reached up to her eyelid. We felt she had to see a doctor because it was her eye and we didn't want any sort of infection happening up in there. But of course ... it's Sunday.
Every day I would walk over with lunch made either from my tiny little kitchen or from Three Forks Market’s service deli. As much as they appreciated the homemade lunches, I could see the twinkle in their eyes when I would unveil the corn dogs or mini tacos or fried chicken, Jo Jo potatoes and ranch dressing for dipping…all of those good greasy snack foods that tasted oh so delicious but that were oh so unhealthy. And there were days when they would come to the trailer for breakfast too, but those days were very few. Usually Kurt and Joslyn were on the work site bright and early now that our neighbor up the road with the heavy equipment business came down and excavated the hole in the ground in a matter of one full day which completely surprised us. We paid a pretty penny of $2000,00 for his services of digging the hole and removing several huge tree stumps but to this day I feel that it was worth every cent because having that hole in the ground meant that Kurt could get working on the shop.

If it has to be South America, I’d go for Uruguay. While Uruguay is probably your best option in South America, its still a far cry from the life and the freedom you enjoy in USA. Especially with the funds you mention, I think it makes no sense whatsoever to go to South America. You can already live pretty well with that money in USA if you invest it wisely. In Argentina the government will eventually steal most of it, one way or the other.

Still, every once in a while, Sue and I carve out a little down time just to 'veg' a bit, which usually entails watching a Netflix DVD or a Laserdisc. While shopping for some holiday decorations a few weeks ago in a thrift store, I came across a Box DVD set of "Sons of Anarchy - The Complete 3rd Season" and picked it up for $4.99. Based on the liner notes it seemed interesting.
After the war was over, and the prisoners returned to England, it was difficult to adjust. The route that most of them took was to suppress the memories of their time in the camps: they just didn't talk about it. My father, a prisoner for five years, was one of these. For years he didn't talk about his experiences at all. When he did begin to, he would tell funny stories about things that happened, only alluding to the more serious stuff in passing: his face would turn dark and still, and he would come out with things like: 'No-one knows what they're capable of, not till they're up against it.' And then he would fall silent, and you wouldn't dream of pushing it any further.
The nagging pains have been bothering me for more than just the enforced lessening of activities… I fear losing focus on the plan and the goal. I have not strayed from eating right. I have been less active and I am trying to measure myself. Am I using the nagging pains as an excuse or are the nagging pains really keeping me from being more active. I have to fight my natural tendency towards sloth…

EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J.—I love long shots in movies.
I know, I apologize that although it's called a movie, there isn't actually any movement in it. I was thrilled last week when a pair of robins started building a nest in my camera bird box. And for the last few days Mrs Robin (or possibly Mr and Mrs Robin, since I can't tell them apart) has been in and out of the nest all week adjusting the grass and moss to her satisfaction, and has laid the first egg this morning, since when she appears to have cleared off. Temporarily, I hope. Probably stocking up on worms and peanuts, for the forthcoming brooding scenario, during which she'll get precious little of anything I imagine.
'I don't know,' she replied. 'Young people nowadays are never satisfied; they always want more and more. They want everything that folk have overseas...you all demand so much from life - you're never satisfied. In the old days, a poor man was content if he had something to eat and a roof over his head. Nowadays everything has to be so high-and-mighty. Everything you set your minds on, you have to have, whether you can afford it or not...And everyone's up to their eyebrows in debt...A fat lot of use it is having schools and books and I don't know what! In the old days we used to be a lot more reasonable.'

“It was all on good terms though,” she continues diplomatically. “But the UK market is a difficult one, that was the problem. It’s a very closed circle that’s hard for an outsider to get in to.
