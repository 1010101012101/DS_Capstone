When he began, Bryson wanted to nurture the idea of session beers in an era when extreme, high alcohol beers got all the attention. It's a worthy project, and one I fully embrace. But the quiet truth is that these days, many of these beers do very well and breweries sell all they can make.

It's not that extreme beers aren't good -- we both love them -- but sometimes you want something delicate, light and refreshing on a hot day. Sometimes you don't want to be hit over the head by an extreme beer.

Riding with steady power over long periods is at the core of long-distance cycling. You go faster if you are strong, fit, efficient and tough-minded. It is the love of the ride and the beauty of the soul-inspiring machine that will keep you going.

A third possibility is that Mason was a knowing part of this system and both distributed and received benefits from it in the way of other participants.

WHEN the state Gaming Control Board revoked the casino license for Foxwoods in 2010, we didn’t breathe a full sigh of relief, since we figured, like a bad penny, the license for yet another casino in the state wasn’t going to go completely away. Sure enough, the Legislature is now moving toward putting the license up for bid — to any and all comers in the state. That means it’s no sure bet that Philadelphia will have a second casino.

The meter company claims it doled out $13.5 million worth of free parking between February 2010 and February 2011, the Sun-Times has reported, and it's demanding that City Hall pay up.

I very seldom agree with conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg, whose work appears in the Times weekly, but he said something Wednesday morning in an interview on NPR that was dead-on: "Aggravation is a muse."

Brian Eno. Maybe he should be inducted as a non-performer, in recognition of his production work. But he should be in. Much like the Velvet Underground (who are in), he expanded the sonic boundaries of rock. His own albums never found a wide audience, but were extremely influential. As a producer, he put his stamp on some of the best work of hall of famers such as U2, Talking Heads and David Bowie, and pushed them to heights they probably wouldn’t have reached on their own. Now in his 60s, he’s still active (and produced Coldplay’s latest hit album).

Mr. Tilley could make his dad proud, and do the rest of Missouri a huge favor, by allowing full debate on House Bill 2300. Legislators, even the ones who benefit from it, know the system is sleazy. If they want to keep it, they should have the guts to vote on it.
The cost of funding Irish debt has risen steadily since September, when the government admitted its bailout of five banks would cost at least euro45 billion, equivalent to euro10,000 for every man, woman and child in Ireland.

The arctic char with heirloom beans comes next, a rustic pairing fit for winter. This rich fish, uncommon on local menus, was seared with the skin on in a very hot cast iron pan, then finished (almost) in a 450 -degree oven.

Doan said the Coyotes weren't exactly targeting Toews.
"There is probably a good case to be made for a U.S. Senator to come to the rescue of a bank in his state," she said. "But the way in which this occurred, particularly given those who are involved, has the potential to leave a bad taste in the mouths of many people."

In terms of importance and safety, tires are at the top of the list. M&S all-season, winter or even snow tires can make the difference between getting there and getting stuck. A tread depth of 50 percent or better is just as critical. Even worn winter tires aren't going to effectively move the snow and water out from under the tire so that the tread can actually grip the pavement.

Admittedly bothered by injuries and health problems, Sullinger has cost himself a huge chunk of money by returning to Ohio State. Nobody likes to hear it because college is part of the American dream, but staying in school hurt him.

The dire condition of most of Michigan's small harbors has serious implications for boating safety, tourism and even some commercial uses. It is time for Congress to step up and figure out how to fund the overdue dredging.
Yet, for such an important effort, the report disappoints in two key areas. The first is that of vision. Washington insiders may care about which widget got mentioned or that the concept of preparing to fight two medium-size wars was smartly dropped in favor of more flexible options. But the quadrennial review offered a far more important opportunity that was missed. President Barack Obama has made a forward-looking, positive vision of America's role in the world a centerpiece of his policy goals, and the Pentagon could have used the review to expand on that vision as it pertains to national security.

"Do I Do" is "the whole package," says Penman, who arranged Wonder's "Creepin'" from "Fulfillingness' First Finale" -- released in 1974, "when I was in diapers," he points out.

It's "super-beautiful," says Cohen, who arranged "Sir Duke," Wonder's tribute to Ellington, to which Cohen adds touches of Charles Mingus and Jimi Hendrix.
Modern detectives trace their lineage in world literature to Oedipus, whose search for his true identity has made him, to some critics, a sleuth dressed in sandals and Theban robes.

The experts forget that for most Americans, the dream of home ownership is not about the money. When my brother Aaron and I get together we don't reminisce about how much money was made when the house we grew up in was sold. We talk about Christmas mornings, barbecues in the back yard and learning responsibility by helping out around the house. Of course, we also share memories of trying to sneak in after curfew without waking Mom and the great parties we threw when we were home alone. Maybe I should have left the last sentence out, but Mom probably already knew.

All of these various chemicals have been linked to the development of cancerous tumors, and chronic inflammation precedes tumor growth in most types of cancer.

And Patria is clearly a party place. The cavernous club is divided into separate rooms, with movable furniture allowing for easy shape-shifting to accommodate small or large celebrations. As night falls, Patria becomes less a restaurant and more a club. (Which means departing dinner guests run smack into that line of eager dancers. Which also means there will likely be a wait for your car; it’s not easy to retrieve a vehicle from the too-tiny kennel out back.)
Any one of those differences, or more than one of them, could be behind the apparently lower stroke risk. Some of the studies that show a link between coffee drinking and reduced stroke risk have also shown that coffee drinkers are more likely to smoke, have lower education levels and have diets higher in potassium. And although it's unlikely that smoking, for instance, is behind their reduced stroke risk, it's possible that something else is.

The emotional reaction to the tape is to speculate that Williams now has no shot at reinstatement in the NFL. But that's not necessarily the case. The league may have been aware of the tape when it penalized Williams. If not, the audio just served to confirm what the NFL already knew.

Personally, I can’t wait.
It's been a few years since I was the parent who climbed into a suddenly empty car and drove away without the kid who had consumed 18-plus years of my life. But this time of year always reminds me of just such a trip in another August, in 2005.

I began supporting Sunderland AFC (of the EPL) in 2005 when they played a friendly match here in Portland. Hundreds of amazing Sunderland fans traveled with the team on their West Coast tour that summer, and we had a blast with them before, during and after our match.

I would come any night, though, for any number of delights I've enjoyed recently: a creamy Gorgonzola flan with late-season peaches and chanterelles; tortellini stuffed with creamy lentils in capon broth studded with cubes of cinnamon-scented cotechino sausage. An exquisite fall pasta turned the tortellini paradigm inside out, with a crimson filling of reduced tomato on the inside, and creamy burrata cheese on the plate. The chicken-liver rigatoni is more irresistible than I'd ever imagined. And crispy-edged slices of homemade mortadella, streaked with pistachio pesto and molten pads of mozzarella, were the highlight of Michaud's stretchy Neapolitan-dough pizza.

Former President Jimmy Carter discovered the natural wonders years ago and has been a frequent visitor, along with some of Hollywood's more familiar faces.
Peter O'Toole: As Bravo's "Inside the Actor's Studio" drifts ever closer to Teen People territory -- Monday night, James Lipton interviews the cast of "Glee" -- it's about time for a master class with one of the greats. "Peter O'Toole: Live from the TCM Classic Film Festival" gives the British legend a chance to reminisce with TCM host Robert Osborne about his approach to his craft. "I didn't want to be known as the blond, blue-eyed movie star. I wanted to be an actor," says O'Toole, who pulled off the rare balancing act of being both. The hour-long session, taped at last year's event, will air at 8 and 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, sandwiched before showings of two O'Toole classics, 1968's "The Lion in Winter" and 1962's "Lawrence of Arabia."

Maybe he's saving the pingpong ball tricks for Part 3.

None seemed more unlikely than this semifinal matchup against Barca, whose dizzying passing attack allows it to score in bunches, especially on its home ground. Barca possessed the ball for 80% of the game, and first-half goals from Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta gave it the lead. Even worse for Chelsea, captain John Terry was tossed from the game in the 38th minute after kneeing Alexis Sanchez from behind.

But what the Blues do have is a true understanding of the "team" game. I believe their strength is the fact that they are built from the back to the front. Consider: Netminder Brian Elliott (the team's lone All-Star representative) is second in the league in goals-against average at 1.68 and second in save percentage at .937. And he's the so-called backup goaltender, with 22 games played this season. Elliott's goaltending partner Jaroslav Halak, meanwhile, ranks 8th in the league with a 2.08 GAA in 24 games and is getting stronger and stronger as the season progresses. Is there another tandem that comes close to that?

CATSKILLS COOL Sometimes, you have to lose a thing to know how much it meant to you, and for us, that was definitely the case with the Catskills. Exploratory visits along the Route 28 corridor after the summer’s intense (and in places devastating) tropical rains revealed a surprising new trend -- the area, notoriously reluctant to change, is actually getting kind of, well, cool. From a beautifully-curated concept store in Andes (Tay Home), whose owner, Nini Ordoubadi, recently rolled out her own fashion line, to the colorful insanity that is The Roxbury -- which has grown from roadside curiosity to one of the best small hotels upstate -- to farm-to-table barbecue at Cha Cha Hut in Arkville, right on down to the sudden hipsterfication of Kingston’s charming Stockade District at the gateway to Catskill Park, it all feels really fresh and fun.

I don’t know if that had anything to do, but after the concussion this year I went into a lull for almost two months. If it’s the case or not... Was I just bad? I don’t know exactly.

It’s a new season, you start it new and you try to help pout your team as much as possible. I was able to get a couple breaks in the first game in Pittsburgh and after that things kind of got rolling.”

Worse still, "Titans" lacks the smoothness and fluidity we have come to expect from action games these days, having instead jerky character and camera movements, stilted dialog, irregular and incongruous scenery changes, and unresponsive controls - all signs of a project that might have been rushed to completion despite the appearance of a delayed release for quality's sake.
Offensive coordinator Mark Helfrich preached caution, insisting there were aspects both Mariota and Bennett could fix. Mariota tossed an interception. Almost nothing went right for Bennett, who admittedly beat himself up a bit afterwards before readjusting his mindset.
