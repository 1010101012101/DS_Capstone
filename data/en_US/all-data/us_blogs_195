Saying "while I write about my child, I think really what I do is look at social issues, politics, pop culture, and my own feelings about work and the world through the eyes of a new mother" is a wee bit verbose in most contexts. Mommyblogger it is. Blech.

Speaking of my ministry, my website has nearly reached 35, 000 views now, and will probably have reached that by the first of this month. I pray that God continues to bless my efforts and that whatever I write will bring glory to Him, and wisdom to others. I know some of the things I write about are hard subjects to read about, but God’s word says that even though these things shouldn’t even be spoken of, that they should be brought into the light and exposed for what they are. And it says that whatever exposes them is light. I pray that I can be a light to the world of darkness. We know that the truth sets us free and when things such as sexual and domestic violence are kept in silence and darkness, they are perpetuated more frequently, but when they are brought to light and exposed for what they are, people are freed from these strongholds on their lives. I pray that by my outspokenness on these issues that people will recognize how wrong these things are and how much damage they do to women and their children. I pray that offenders will repent and that victims will be healed. God’s hand is not so weak that it cannot save even the worst offenders if they will repent of their sins and change their wicked ways. And God will defend those who are weak and powerless against their offenders. Their blood may cry out from the ground as Abel’s did, but like Cain, the offenders will be punished. And though offenders may repent and be forgiven as King David did when he committed adultery and murder, they will still suffer the consequences of their behaviors. King David was told that trouble would never leave his house because of his sin, and if you’re familiar with that story, you know that is exactly what happened. One of his sons raped his daughter, he lost the baby that he and Bathsheba conceived, and one of his own sons turned against him. Punishment by God is much worse than punishment by man, but God is merciful as well as just. We must trust in both God’s justice and His love. God’s word tells us what he requires of us and that is to love mercy, do justice, and take care of the poor. We can’t do justice, if we don’t speak out on these issues.

When using this, I decided to focus on exfoliating my upper arms, as it is there that I have small, stubborn dry patches that prove difficult to shift! I gently rubbed the scrub into my skin in a circular motion whilst in the shower, and then washed it off with warm water. I noticed that, because real lime is used in the product, as I rubbed the fruit popped and let out its natural oils so I was hit with bursts of the gorgeously zingy smell of lime. Unfortunately, the ginger scent wasn’t as obvious.

The medium-sized surprise was being invited over for a homecooked meal with Christina Ly’s mom… AT THE NOTORIOUS DONUT SHOP. I spent hours preparing for what I thought was going to be a “my friend’s mom and me” type of date, but turns out she just cooked enough food for a village and then watched me eat it with Christina. So yeah, you can pretty much sum it up to a 50% awesome 50% disappointing surprise. I’m really good at flattering parents, so I thought I would get another chance to wiggle my way into a possible adoption with the Ly’s, but I guess I’ll have to settle for wiggling further into Christina’s heart.

It takes place in England during the early 20th century, and centers around a wealthy family (who lives in Downton Abbey...hence the name) and their many servants. I love history and this takes place during such a fascinating time. I love all the period details of the show (even if they aren't all completely correct) and the house is amazingly gorgeous. Everything is so formal and there is such distinction between classes, it's so totally different from life today. Each episode is full of drama, romance, scandal, and some humor...mainly thanks to the Dowager Countess of Grantham, played fabulously by Maggie Smith.

The show is arguably as emotionally rich as Clannad, but comes in a more compact package. Because of that, every episode has good pacing and some serious teary moments; you rarely get the feeling that scenes are wasted on something totally unrelated. Each episode has a few emotional highlights with the climax usually at the end. The climax itself is either very tear-inducing, a revelation or both. It is accentuated by the ending song (See ‘The Score’) starting while the story is still unfolding. While this trick is very powerful, especially with a great ending song like Secret Base, and very suited for climaxes , it is used almost every episode, thus losing its luster over time. They should’ve only used it for the real big moments.

It was just about a week ago that I made the connection with Tara (Craftilicious) and St Luke's Hospice Card Challenge) - this is the lovely card that Tara made. Unlike me, I think Tara is really a natural neutrals crafter (whereas I had the heebie jeebies at last week's Less Is More Challenge, which was to use neutrals). Shades of brown used perfectly Tara - do hop over and drool over that luscious flower too girls! Get the 'dark brown sugar glitter' - isn't it just beautiful?!!

We keep telling everyone that Xander's a pretty happy kid. Even after this ordeal, he didn't seem fazed. Eddie told us he did great.

While it seems nobody can drink enough water, for cancer patients, this goes doubly. Those experiencing fatigue, nausea and other symptoms of cancer and cancer treatments can help fight some of the bodily harm that comes with that by replenishing their lost fluid regularly. High intake of water also helps regulate the body temperature. This can reduce much of the discomfort that comes with sickness.

It is that time of forced stillness, crying, solitude and loneliness, numbness and apathy that I am in the cocoon phase of my butterfly animal totem. I feel like I am swimming underwater in a lake full of warm gooey honey. I cannot move but slowly, sometimes not at all, but I am still surrounded by this comfort in knowing that even though I do not have control over when, I will eventually transform into a butterfly. Even though I can not feel her - and at one time in my life accused her of abandoning me - The Goddess is with me just as she is every day of my life. That thought, though more often than not deeply buried in my sub-conscious, is something I've learned by embracing this Darkness and swimming in it. If one fights the tide or panics in deep water, they will drown. I lay on my back and trust the Darkness and wallow in it. I feel it enclose upon every cell in my body. This embracing it and of itself does not lessen my Depression, I guess it makes it more tolerable.

In the end, however, as Catholics we ought not be using the argument that things are immoralsimply because “because the Bible tells me so”, at least not with avowed, hostile secularists who are more interested in tripping you up than actually promoting justice or anything of the sort. We can wade into secular territory and beat them at their own game, because what theyput forward as good or acceptable is, regardless of any religious argument, socially destructive and often destructive to the individual as well. That’s why they’re immoral and prohibited by God in the first place.

@Windaddict's/@hopsafari declared this dish to be his favorite dessert of all time. This is Chef Philip's take on the Wendy's Frosty with Fries. It isn't a secret that I'm a lover of the Wendy's Frosty, and this dessert really knocks it out of the park. A french fry cream borders the outside of the dish that is topped with a variety of sweet soils. On top of that is a aerated and dehydrated chocolate shake topped with a creamy sorbet. Many of Chef Philip's desserts require that you eat all of the components together. When you eat each one of these components together, you'll get a time warp back to your childhood of fries in ice cream. You might even be doing it as an adult. Have no shame. Chef Philip doesn't.

The beautiful fun fur Spring time wreath! I saw this over and over and over again before I finally decided I needed to do this! The original post was all in another language but here is the link. I bought the wreath and 2 full rolls of fun fur. I was a little disappointed that my local craft store did not have any plain green fun fur but this turned out even more eye catching with the spring color stripes. This wreath turned out awesome, but I need to warn that it takes a very long time to wrap. When I finished up two full rolls and at least 90 minutes later, the fun fur covered about two thirds of the styrofoam wreath! Quick thinking led me to taking some ribbon I already had laying around and alternating pink and purple around the remaining part of the showing green styrofoam.

My mother liked his border flowers, and my father talked to him once about fertilizer. This is Susie Salmon. Watching from heaven, Susie sees her happy, suburban family devastated by her death, isolated even from one another as they each try to cope with their terrible loss alone. Over the years, her friends and siblings grow up, fall in love, do all the things she never had the chance to do herself. But life is not quite finished with Susie yet …”

The Ex Games is an intense ride. Hayden and Nick were an item in seventh grade, and have been enemies ever since. Well, maybe not entirely enemies, considering how Nick is all Hayden can think about, and if her little brother's logic is right, then Nick maybe likes Hayden more than he lets on too. When their best friends pair off, the Exes find themselves thrown together more and more, and soon Winter Break turns into a hot contest with Poser tickets on the line. A fun mix of snowboarding and high school dynamics, The Ex Games was a perfect wintry read. I also really enjoyed that Echols used chapter headings to introduce snowboarding lingo (I'm a word nerd, and I happen to love the winter X Games).
I shamefully admit that I thought the crutches were just too much for him. "It's not enough support" I would confess to Jason over and over. But he told me to just keep trying them and that he'll get stronger. Looking back, I know I gave up the crutches too soon. But it was so incredibly painful to see Roman struggle with something. Seeing that pain made the idea of mediocrity sound...not so bad.

Quote of Noah Heller
Pope Benedict XVI said: “Only by “holding fast” to sound teaching (2 Thess 2:15; cf. Rev 2:12-29) will we be able to respond to the challenges that confront us in an evolving world. Only in this way will we give unambiguous testimony to the truth of the Gospel and its moral teaching. This is the message which the world is waiting to hear from us. Like the early Christians, we have a responsibility to give transparent witness to the “reasons for our hope”, so that the eyes of all men and women of goodwill may be opened to see that God has shown us his face (cf. 2 Cor 3:12-18) and granted us access to his divine life through Jesus Christ. He alone is our hope! God has revealed his love for all peoples through the mystery of his Son’s passion and death, and has called us to proclaim that he is indeed risen, has taken his place at the right hand of the Father, and “will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead” (Nicene Creed).”

JA, who had been most interested in this boy finding a family, took it upon himself to pray right then and asked God if we could be his family. He finished and then asked to talk to me.

Unbeknownst to me, he then talked to CP about us adopting the boy.

We retired workers are very proud of being citizens of the greatest country in the world, but … we cannot think it is the greatest possible country when about 65 percent of the aged do not have any insurance to deal with their needs for hospitalization and medical care. Without such insurance, the retired person must pretty much exhaust any savings he has before he can get free hospitalization. This is a constant source of worry. Many of my acquaintances will not visit a doctor for minor illness because they have no money to pay for drugs. After they exhaust their savings they go on welfare to get medical aid, but then, in many cases, it is too late.The real difference between Democrats and Republicans on health care is not, Cohn writes, between an idealized free market and Stalinist central planning.

The argument from reason is really a family of arguments to show that reasoning is incompatible with naturalism. Here, naturalism is understood as the idea that foundationally, there are only physical objects, properties and relations, and anything else reduces to, supervenes on, or emerges from that. For our purposes, one of the most important claims of naturalism is that all causation is passive, automatic, event causation (an earthquake automatically causes a tidal wave; the tidal wave responds passively): there are no agent causes, where something does not happen automatically but only because the agent exerts his active power by choosing to do it. The most famous version of the argument from reason is epistemological: if naturalism were true, we could not be justified in believing it. Today, I want to focus on the ontological argument from reason, which asserts that there cannot be reasoning in a naturalistic world, because reasoning requires libertarian free will, and this in turn requires a unified, enduring self with active power.

The first one is by Plutarch, a Greek historian who was born around AD 45, about 75 years after she died. In his biography of Mark Anthony he writes this about Cleopatra (and I paraphrase): "Her beauty was not exceptional enough to instantly affect those who saw her, but she had a charming way of conversing, and an invigorating presence. Her sweet voice was as well-modulated as a lyre, and she could speak whichever language she pleased."

The coda of New Wave Hookers has a surprisingly surreal vibe about it. However, it shouldn't be that surprising; there is, after all, a giant Residents-style eyeball sitting on top of one of the desks and Jamal does go on this strange tangent about disembodied dicks in Borneo. At any rate, the sight of a recently awaken Jimmy driving through the neon-tinged city, reflecting on all the debauchery that has transpired, while the "New Wave Hookers" theme plays over the soundtrack, was the perfect way to wrap up this titillating masterpiece.

For this example I have broken the form data into three MySQL tables. One for the Volunteer’s personal information, one for interests and one for committee selections. Note that a single Volunteer can have anywhere from zero to four interests and from zero to eight committee selections. This is a typical one-to-many relationship. Though this session is not about database design you should recognize that the most efficient way to store information on a Volunteer’s interests and committees is to create a separate table for each and only save what is selected.

Today was a big day of progress with Dinah. We began with grooming and then a hand walk. It had been raining and Dinah was kind of wet so I wanted her to dry before I put her saddle on. After the hand walk I worked on walking her all around the barn, led her through the barn, into a stall, on mats, concrete, I dragged a chair around while I was leading her, just trying to do all kinds of things to get her ready to handle the competition. Then I took her to the stair step, and practiced doing a turn on the forehand keeping her front feet on the first stair. It took a little work and patience but once she figured out what I wanted she was really good.

As a whole, my take was that the films was “good but not great” for reasons I’ll explain in a second, and I’m sticking to that even if it makes me a killjoy for those who have wholly embraced it as everything awesome is supposed to be (Scott Tobias’ review at The AV Club is a pretty close mirror to my own thoughts . . . if I weren’t going to itemize and explain every detail I though worth considering). As for the latter folks swept up in the hype, which seems to be far too much of the internet, witness, for example, the simplistic, uncritical accolades from “film critic” Margot McGowan at SF Gate. McGowan’s absurd “review” is narrow in scope and merely lauds the film for not breaking the from those elements that allow for a feminist reading of the book (which is a dubious position for many reasons that other, more capable folks have pointed out). Not that it isn’t a reasonable point to care that Katniss isn’t sexed-up in the film, but in the book that concern is primarily and textually Katniss’ . . . transferred over to the reader via her inner monologue. And the ultimate choice on whether or not to go this route in presenting her is Cinna’s, which he decidedly goes against. Further, concerns McGowan raises about gender equality (in numbers of tributes? seriously?) are patently absurd, as is the ladies working together to save each other angle she generates. The film is loyal to the book on these counts, which isn’t the same as it being “awesome,” which implies levels of both loyalty and creative changes to the source material that still capture the spirit of the novel and enthrall the audience.

There’s always Walter. Plus, don’t you wonder how the Antares boys are doing? I do.
Yet another interesting metric is to see which individual authors are the most read amongst the blogs.
“My father lived to 97; my grandfather lived to 97, and they all enjoyed it and somehow we’re being told that this is no good and I think there is a degree of management that becomes micromanagement and when you cross that line simply what you’re doing is wrong,” Richter said.
He turned, walking backwards while he talked. “You’ll be fine, scamp. You just hang out here for a while. I’ll be back. You just hang around and have fun.” I tried to call after him again, but he had already turned back, walking with steady strides towards the car. He dove ino the front seat, started the car, and with a quick wave to me out the window, pulled out into the street and headed off towards the 7-Eleven, about 4 blocks away.
As you all know, Sinjin is a vampire and as such, I wanted him to be shrouded in mystery. To me, vampires are the most seductive, manipulative and mysterious of Underworld creatures and I didn't want Sinjin to stray from this model very much.
Griffin and others contained that growth by quickly undermining branches in areas that growth had taken place in by sacking organisers where it did.

Q1.) What do/did you do with your materials from classes in college or high school? I kept all the papers I wrote, because it was my writing and I needed it for portfolios, but I usually just through away tests and quizzes. And I sold my books back.
“This commitment represents unprecedented leadership by the higher education sector, which is the first and only major U.S. sector with a significant number of its members to commit to climate neutrality. Higher education leaders are sending a strong signal to society that climate change and other large-scale unsustainable practices pose a real and urgent threat and that colleges and universities are working together not only to model sustainable behavior, but also to provide the knowledge and educated graduates necessary for society to do the same,” says Dr. Anthony D. Cortese, president of Second Nature, organizer and supporter of the initiative.
So let's add things up: 120 copies of the book x $13.18 (the cost of the $24.95 book less your retailer's discount) comes to $1581.60. So far this event has cost the bookstore $2053.60 and it hasn't even started yet.
I ended up hiring the Chaplain who came to bless the fleets on Sailpast at the yacht club once a year. I spoke to him on the phone, enquired as to cost and I think it was roughly $200. I told him what had happened, explained what I’d like done and told him I’d get him some basic information on Rob ahead of time so he could familiarize himself. This Chaplain did not know Rob or I at all.

They’re out there. Trolls are meant to be smacked down, though I wouldn’t call them concern trolls, because they’re incapable of misrepresenting the concern part of the concern troll protocol. It seems more like a minority of angry antipsychiatry usurpers have united in an effort to seize the mental health discourse, make discussion ugly for any mental health blogger inclined to post about a casual relationship with said drugs and prescriber, who gives the topic due proportion, as an aside, one detail in a multi-faceted narrative. Not to mention any blogger who feels conflicted about using pharmaceuticals, you will watch your mouth or rue the day you turned off comment moderation.

He’s the only person I personally know who has travelled to Bologna to try answer his questions–although he didn’t seem to find anything definitive.

In all countries, including the USA, Greece, and Spain, there are considerable portion of the population of each generation that might be labeled as the “Half-wayers”.

From the learning rooms...we finished reading about the Civil War. It has been fun to listen to the kids as they make comments like, "Man! Those generals could have been on the same side, right? Especially when they both believed in the same God? How could they think two completely different things? Especially when it came to human life!" We've had some interesting discussions. Each child's spelling words are getting harder. We're in our ninth week of school and everyone is still enjoying it, including me! Leif thinks science is boring right now and he really loves science! He just needs an experiment soon.

As The Independent today also whipped Coulson’s tumbril towards the guillotine – ‘There is a stench of disbelief over what Mr Coulson says he knew about the illegal actions of at least one of his reporters who intercepted the personal mobile phones of public figures’ – senior Opposition figures were looking forward gleefully to Wednesday’s PMQs, and the possibility of asking David Cameron some extremely awkward questions. There were also rumours that Home Secretary Theresa May has told the PM of her ‘discomfort’ about retaining Coulson, given the likelihood of further civil cases which might incriminate the Communications chief.
Just to top it off, as we were leaving the cinema I bumped into one of my ex's. Our history is a most unpleasant one and my stomach turned just to see his face again. I hate that he can still reduce me to feeling that way. He saw me and tried to talk to me and when I ignored him and tried to walk away he followed me and wouldn't leave me alone. Alan rather bravely stood up to him, which I loved him for, but it took several long, painful minutes for my ex to give it up and let me go. It put a bit of a downer on my day and has left me rehashing things I thought I'd put behind me a long time ago.
In an interview in a 1969 LWT series called On The Record, Paul Raymond was interviewed by Alan Watson and rather bizarrely compared stripping to stand-up comedy. He said (I paraphrase): “Comedians tell gags to get laughs. Stripping is like comedy. If the act isn’t having the desired effect, then the stripper has to work harder.”
Traditionally men are supposed to be the protectors, which is a role I hold dear and refuse to not play. A lot of men play the role too but they go very overboard. They end up controlling the woman in their life, and it turns to abuse and disrespect. The biggest problem I have with the role is men who expect things in return and get mad when they don’t get anything.

So - what makes a good paper for Copic Markers? You want a paper that won't feather (spreading across the top - it's OK if it bleeds through the back), that won't over saturate too quickly, will blend colours well and the colourless blender will be able to move ink. If it doesn't pass these tests, then you won't get the results you are looking for!

What intrigues me is that the last trip to New York by these three procurers ended the day before DSK was arrested for the alleged assault upon Nafissatou Diallo. I’m intrigued because – let’s face it – if you were keeping the Head of the IMF under surveillance, with this entourage of pimps and hookers, it wouldn’t have taken much brainpower for a security agency to work out how to ensnare Strauss-Kahn. Indeed, your main problem would’ve been slotting in the jailbait between the hordes of other women servicing DSK in one way or another.

In the late 1960s four little girls went to primary school together in England. Then they went to the same secondary school. At 14 one of them emigrated with her parents to America. In her 20s another emigrated to Israel (me!) and ten years later, one moved with her own family to the south coast of England. They sort of kept in touch by heresay, gossip and occasional visits. Then came email, then came Friends Reunited and they reconnected.

He thanked me for telling him these things and wandered away. I saw him later sitting on one of the back seats, watching the leaders in the room. Which made me feel better about what I did. I would like to think that I may have helped someone perhaps stay in the scene, as opposed to never understanding why everyone is "snobby" and leaves to go salsa or grow bonsai or something else other than tango.

Mrs Russell said he began swearing and ‘slamming cupboards’. She suggested he be given sweets and his favourite Noddy toy to calm him and then be driven to hospital by a neighbour. But this was rejected and the medical staff were told to go outside because they were upsetting Mr Russell.

One pleasant thought to keep us thinking positively through what lies ahead: by the time the main bulk of crop circles appears in June and July, we shall have amassed a superb body of new designs, coded messages and even be in a position to interpret some of them.

So I pulled up Pandora and began writing shortly after dropping Mads off from school. Then I took a break. Writing resumed. Then Melissa, Izzy and I went to Meijer for some grocery shopping. I went right back to writing when we returned home. It was great. Another break to play outside with Mads and then back at it. With the exception of a too frequent impulse to check Facebook and Twitter while I sat at my computer, I kept a steady flow of writing going all night long.
Starting in the late 1960’s Ms. Nast became known to an entirely different generation of Americans through such popular television programs as “Take That Back!” “The Deenie Nast Show,” “What’s Shakin’?,” “Toni’s Place” (later called “Deenie’s Place”), “Mrs. Vinegar, Crime Solver,” and Hallmark Hall of Fame’s “When She Finally Fell Down: The Catherine Steemer Story” for which she was awarded an Emmy for Best Performance by an actress in a drama in 1985.

Although the mechanics of wave action on beaches are imperfectly understood, geologists can suggest ways in which a seawall might hasten erosion. On a gently sloping beach, a wave’s force is reduced as the surge of water, or swash, rushes onshore. Much of the water’s energy is gone by the time it returns down the seaward slope as backwash, so it carries off relatively little sand.

I’m a big fan of Aqualabel since my first purchases during my trip to Taiwan last year. I’m actually on my second bottle of the Enhancer, and this is a backup bottle! I’m also looking for cheaper alternatives to my Anessa sunscreen, and since Aqualabel and Anessa are both from the Shiseido family, I’m hoping the Perfect Protect Milk UV works just as great.

The earliest surviving type is the trestle table, typical in the wonderful halls of the Center Ages. Originals from this period of time are hugely sought just after and very rare. The prime was formed from extended wood planks, usually taking up the duration of the hall, all-around which the lord, girl and complete corporation of the manor would be seated. Later, the planks and trestles would be dismantled, and the space applied for dancing.

“In the absence of emails drafted in the hypothetical, fundamentally incriminating terms I describe, I struggle to see that the High Court will be moved to overturn the jury’s decision. Similarly, if … alleged perjury is limited to the general unlawful practices of employees at the News of the World, and his knowledge of them, how does that impact on the critical issues of the Sheridan trial, concerning swingers clubs, his confessions to his colleagues and his lies about both in Court? These are the questions which Sheridan’s representatives will have to work up persuasive answers to, if their client is to see his conviction quashed on grounds of new evidence. As the Lord Justice General noted, setting aside the verdict of a jury is no light matter. And on these tests, convincing the High Court to overturn Sheridan’s conviction may be a very tall order indeed, despite alleged perjury, despite absent emails, whatever Tom Watson believes.”
The film even makes it clear that the authorities should not even be there, yet it continues to glory in their fight to escape. The last straw, though, is when Evans attempts to toss in some plot twists near the end in a pathetic sop to those growing weary of the senseless fighting. Of course, you can't really have plot twists without a plot to begin with; how can you have any pudding if your don't eat your meat, etc., etc. The Raid is such a hollow exercise, one in which the mastery of its choreography is surrounded by the mediocrity of every other aspect of its design and execution. Lamely propelled by Mike Shinoda's score with all the enthusiasm of someone roped into carting a friend's armoire up a flight of stairs, The Raid embodies the perfunctory, meaningless, hyperviolent slog it charts. Who would think that a film of nothing but action could be so utterly boring?

Despite the racial difference between the shooter and the decedent, there were no allegations of racial bias. Scott was not charged with a hate crime. There was no Federal civil rights investigation. There were no white protests.

I’ve also given a fair bit of thought on why I’ve been pushing myself so hard. I’m not going to blame Tavis (he’s not nearly as pushy as, oh say, Devan), and I’m not even going to let myself off by saying the story was flowing and I just went with it. That was the case for most of Possession, no doubt about that, but the ending was like pulling teeth and I’m not happy with it, yet I pretty literally forced myself to it anyway, rather than doing the sensible thing and letting myself have that day off that I had definitely earned. So why did I do that to myself (stupidly) and risk burn out? I think the easiest way to explain it is to admit that I feel guilty some days. Maybe that seems silly to some, especially in light of what I’ve managed to accomplish in the last four months, but it’s true.

Her article confirms what I’ve seen in general: the abolition of humanities courses of all sorts. It also coheres with what I’ve seen others teach in the general education introductory literature courses. I used to teach one — I did it for about 10 years on and off. It’s now abolished: I did the two parter I’ll call the first half of British literature and the second half. There was also a one term version; I did notice other colleagues who did the one term version especially would do a couple of famous medieval, and Renaissance works and then basically leap to the 19th century. One reason towards the end I did separate books (I did not order the Norton) was it enabled me to chose what I thought would be more popular (Fielding’s Joseph Andrews, Gay’s Beggar’s Opera), work I simply liked better (I’d use Cruttwell’s Penguin of Johnson), ” to go outside English (I’d assign Lafayette’s La Princesse de Cleves in English) …

Brave Girls Club , and left off telling you about the lovely Christy Tomlinson...I took Christy"s online class: The She Art Workshop . Again, rebellious student that i am, Christy said-Don't put a face on the girls...Well, of course, what did i do? Yup! i put a face on them! And as beautiful as Suzi's girls were, i wanted to make the eyes look different, a little "smiley" :) When i had been at Brave girls camp, i'd had such a problem with my art being flat. i could not get past the fact that all these ladies were making art that was, gasp, dimensional! So one night i was laying in bed, thinking and not sleeping...How can i get over this "raised" art 'problem'? Humm, when i suddenly had the idea of making my Curlie girls with 3D hair! ( i DO happen to have curlie hair, so maybe that came easily to me!) Could i do it? How could i do it? What materials would i use? And then you know what? i did it! And the ideas kept/keep flowing. Sooo, remember that this is the short version! At BGC, i met Elana Etcheverry from Scrapbook Royalty (Charity Wings.org). Elena is awesome and beautiful and smart and talented and runs a charity organization. She is friends with Suzi Blu. (i don't even know how they met, 'forgotten to ask either of them). Elana was having her first annual Seaside Soiree (check under EVENTS), and asked me to come.(Last Dec). She said, 'You'll get to meet Suzi' and of course i could not resist...So i did meet Suzi last December and then got to see her ( and Christy) again at Donna Downeys Inspired event in Charlotte, N.C. this past June. ( Must tell you about Inspired at another time, because this is getting way too long already)... i wanted to show Suzi one of my Curlie Girls, so i brought it along, and she, sweet thing, saw it and asked if she could put it in her book...HELLO! Could she? Well of course the answer was a resounding YES! (with a bit of silent screaming inside!) and a lot of beaming outside. So, thats my little, itty, bitty brag. Sorry. Just a little one...ok, i'm done...i can't wait for Suzi's book to come out. She was in the absolute last stages when i first wrote this, but it was sent to the publisher July 1st. i want to see it not only because of my one little picture, but because Suzi is so amazingly talented and has so much to offer! Way to go Miss Suzi Blu! Thank you to each and every lady mentioned here, by name or not, for helping me make my artistic journey..and for the inspiration!

The takeout lunch selection was similar to Cojean, my new favorite lunch spot, but not as good and a little more expensive. So why ever would I return? The drugstore has one important and dangerous advantage: Pierre Hermé macaroons! Merde. I’m in trouble.
Now bake a cake:
The assumption that vicarious liability or the legal doctrine of respondeat superior protects a nurse against a medical negligence claim is a mistaken one. If the employer provides legal representation, the attorney representing the nurse will almost always be the same attorney representing and being paid by the hospital or employer.
Guess you are wondering where my other 2 images are....
But our feelings have no bearing on facts, not even grief. Nine years on, I would tell this young man that the best way to honor his father's memory is to ask and understand why the attack that killed him happened. Warmongers framed the debate in the early years to make it seem that those who questioned aggressive policies were unpatriotic. While emotionally effective in a traumatized nation, it is typical neocon nonsense. Police always investigate the motive of a crime. That does not mean they sympathize with the killing! It's just good detective work.
So my goal for the next week - amongst catching up on four assignments, getting started on another two, exercising, mothering, farming, learning off of my endurance mentor, cleaning and my Board of Trustees duties - is to write a letter to an old friend and, here's the big challenge, ACTUALLY SEND IT.
As a writer, too, I want to read more. I want to know more about the UK market, about what readers are enjoying, about where genres are heading. But where do I start?
The last knot was pure Second Realm, though. You tied it backwards, then pulled the whole thing through itself, and somehow the ends of the rope joined inside the knot. What remained was a loop of rope with four knots in it that could never be untied, short of cutting. You made a four knot to summon the Four Knot. Dora would come for him. She was in the Second Realm anyway. Nearby. Rel let Rel go and waited for the Sherim to carry him back to himself.
Oh, and could you do me a favor? If you are reading this, could you look over to the right, scroll down, and click on the 'follow' button? It would just make me feel important. And we all need to feel important every once in awhile. ;)

After that win there was a break in filming. We had to go back to our dressing rooms and change clothes. Different episode, different outfits. We had been instructed to bring 3 changes of clothes with us. More makeup was applied and microphones were reattached. The microphone guy kept readjusting my clothes and tucking in the back of my shirt.
I will also have to do a bit more research on John Fisher, the son of one-time Labor Prime Minister Andew Fisher. According to Cahill’s piece on Lockwood, his friend Fisher was active around the Spanish Civil war. He could have come across anti-Stalinists and Trotskyists in that context, like George Orwell did.

Trof is one of those trendy new bars that Manchester and surrounds do so well and others seem to do so badly. It is in a lovely old building, just along from Shudehill Interchange, thus handy for me and my nemesis, the 17 bus. Downstairs it has a nice bar with the usual sofa-ish mix of furniture and big windows. Troff sells some good stuff, some mainstream and thankfully, cask beer - like most such bars in Manchester - though it isn't right up there on the beer front, being more a solid, dependable venue which attracts a good crowd. I've been there with Tyson and had some excellent beer and been there when we have had to retreat as nothing appealed.
My songs are talking about my recalls and my yesterday's dream. It is very private and my lyrics are very unclear & ambiguous. So, when people listen to my songs, I hope that they feel their own somethings. I hate to explain my songs and lyrics. I want people not to understand but to listen easily. I want to describe my songs as life-background music. Simple sound is my motto.

I went home early to listen to the crackling of the wood, by the fireside. I watched the blaze of the fire, and held my anti-depressants close to my chest. Then I began to weep. I wept, and I remembered how much it hurt to have someone you love vanish off the face of earth. I wished I could vanish, too, but I did not want anyone to suffer or grieve over my death.

It is natural to desire a nice job, car, home, or loving partner. But when we feel that we are not OK without them, then those things possess us, hold us in some way. They become temporary gap fillers and will not bring us the lasting happiness we truly seek. The desire for them will bring about not joy, but suffering.

Abercrombie & Fitch have allegedly spent over $3 million dollars for http://www.abercrombieuksoutlet.co.uk/ scent spraying machines for all its flagship stores. The familiar scent that permeates through the store and is synonymous with the clothing is a variation of the Fierce Cologne which they introduced in 2002. Sales of the Cologne since 2002 have topped $190 and projections for 2010 alone suggest a forecast sales figure of over $90 million. Their signature scent, Fierce Cologne has been increasingly difficult to buy in the UK and UK purchasers are reluctant to buy direct from the USA because of the complications of having to pay tax on purchases. With just one UK store in Central London, admirers of their fragrances are finding it more and more difficult to source genuine products.

It was a relatively simple refashioning, but one that I'm proud of for its subtlety and craftsmanship. Unfortunately, I didn't think to take a "before" picture. When I purchased this lavender top, it was a short dress with kangaroo pockets that seemed awkwardly incongruous with the delicacy of the lace. I only wore it as a nighty, partially because it was so soft, but mainly because I couldn't find a way to style it that would satisfy my personal standards. Then when I laundered it, it shrunk a good 4", also sending the kangaroo pockets off-grain (a common problem with cheap factory-produced garments, as they're often cut off-grain in order to save fabric and costs). So to start with, I carefully removed the kangaroo pockets and further shortened and evened-out the hem so that the off-grain-ness is only noticeable by me (I think).

Saturday was a busy day for us – it started with a drive to Midas at 7:45 a.m. to drop off Jay Pea’s car; she’s had a power steering leak for a couple of months now so it was time to get that fixed. We then headed back to a Tae Kwon Do Tournament for K-Cat and Doodle at 9 a.m. Doodle got second place in form and third place in sparring while K-Cat got third in form – they compete in different classes for form but in the same class for sparring.

In the fall we have our planning retreat. This is a retreat where we set the goals for the next year. We vision, we plan, we dream big. Our goal is to come away with a set of congregational goals. This set of goals guides the ministry teams in setting their goals for the next year. Then after this is accomplished, the staff can set their goals to support the ministry goals, which support the congregational goals. As a pastor, I wait to set my goals once this entire process is done. My goals should support and encourage the goals of the staff, ministries, and congregation. All of this helps to ensure alignment all the way through the entire ministry of the church.

Of course, such a definition of “Vedic” is not entirely wrong – regardless of how modern scholarship tries to cripple the term. By it’s very design, Vedic culture is not a static thing that happened at some point in time and is now dead. It is something that lives, grows, and thrives through time. So the fact that the term “Vedic Astrology” was coined in the ’80s, likely by an American, does not in itself prove any illegitimacy.
Democrats aren’t faultless. Even Mother Jones’ Kevin Drum grudgingly admits to a leftward shift on such issues as gay rights and financial regulation. (It’s worth noting, however, that these issues are perhaps the two on which a shift to the left is most needed.) Drum concludes that blame for the flight from the center can hardly be apportioned equally:

He will listen to a reasoned argument, but then respond with boilerplate conservative arguments against the rational point I just made. The argument in question was regarding raising taxes vs. cutting spending. He threw out the standard "can't raise taxes, have to cut spending" argument, which I let him have. However, I then asked him what specific spending he would like to see cut, and this is where he ran into a speed bump. You see, to say that we need to "cut spending" is easy; but what people fail to realize is that while Republicans continue to try and cut their way out of this fiscal mess, it's impossible to do so without raising taxes, because the programs that we're currently offering are a bare bones of what they once were, because they've all already been cut. That is why we see Republicans taking a swipe at Medicare (not a smart move); this is the largest expenditure in the budget, and one of the only things left that actually could be trimmed (or at least that could be trimmed enough to make a fiscal impact on the budget).
80 % of the sketches are really clever and funny. The other 20 are just okay. A lot of them are plain absurd (typical for our humor) and always follow the same pattern: they always show the opposite of what is normally expected. In that sense, the humor gets a bit predictable. It’s never politically incorrect though, which is another kind of humor that Flemish are famous for. Apart from the sketches where they joke with Catholicism. I’m getting so fed up with those jokes, especially since the makers don’t are to joke with the Islam or Judaism. I say: don’t joke with religion at all, or joke with all of them. ‘What if catholics were more fanatic’ was the worst of them all. ‘What if Jesus was a politician’, on the other hand, was one of the best.

Emotions are the fuel for the Law of Attraction, the Tenfold Rule, the Golden Rule. Honking spiritual laws. The big Karma Kahuna. (FYI, Kahuna is a Hawaiian word. My favorite definition is a “priest, sorcerer, magician, wizard, minister, expert in any profession.” It’s also Australian slang for penis.) That whole, ‘you get what you give’ thing—I’ve seen this. It’s science. (Wikipedia gives it pseudoscience. Close enough.) Emotional triggers occur when you have an instinctual negative emotional response to a person, topic, place or smell that is not based solely on what is currently happening
Re: “Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.” Yowza! Jesus lays down the law, and he means business, because there’s really not a lot that could be worse than being paralyzed and motionless for 38 years. In my limited imagination, at least! The implication here is that the man’s illness was a punishment for something he did (“Stop sinning instead of “don’t sin”). Also, it doesn’t come through so well in my summary, but in the actual text the implication was that after healing him, and after all the stuff with the pharisees went down, Jesus went out specifically looking for the man again. And when he found him is when he told him this. So Jesus seems extra determined here.

A Sky News blog reports: “Bill Nighy, the veteran British actor, has obviously touched a raw nerve in the City. Nighy’s endorsement of a global ‘Robin Hood Tax’ on the world’s banks attracted international media coverage earlier this week. In a short film to promote the launch, Nighy plays a banker who eventually agrees to a 0.05% tax on international bank transactions to raise up to £250bn annually to fight poverty and climate change in the UK and abroad. And on the website www.robinhoodtax.org supporters of the idea (slogan: “not complicated, just brilliant”) registered their enthusiasm in their thousands. Until, that is, 3.41 on the afternoon of the day of the launch, when the team behind the website noticed that opponents of the tax were suddenly registering votes at the rate of six every second. Within five minutes, the ‘No’ votes had soared from 1500 to 8000.”

Since the end of the financial year has arrived and reports need to be written he suggested we should walk the local paths so he had an idea of their condition. We set out for “a short walk” at 1.00 pm on Monday, him with a map and a large pair of clippers for clearing away brambles and me with a camera. I thought we should perhaps take food and drink, but he reckoned we’d only be gone for forty-five minutes or so and it wouldn’t be necessary. Two and a half hours later we were still walking, but by now I was hungry, thirsty and desperately needed the loo. He helpfully pointed at the nearest bush and assured me he would tell me if anyone was around, but I still couldn’t bring myself to go. He was fine, having no such modesty!

One year, the school held a cheer competition. Every homeroom would create a new cheer and demonstrate their offering at an assembly in the gym. The homeroom that won with the best cheer would get a FREE DAY OFF from school. My homeroom had always been hardheaded and heterodox. I often suspect that the powers-that-be had lumped us together on purpose. Nonetheless, we considered out options. We thought HARD about "Tippety-tuck, Motherfuck…" as a catchy opener but were ultimately too chicken to go through with that. We finally settled for this fine ditty:
The tendrils begin to thicken and stretch before her very eyes, growing at a hideous rate to encircle her bare torso. She looks around the room, screaming for someone to stop it, but they merely talk amongst themselves with a mixture of excitement and disgust, while her father, now mutated into a giant beast she almost thinks she recognizes, prods violently at the other pustules. These too reveal growing, heaving, porous bundles of slimy flesh sprouting translucent elastic bulbs, slowly filling up with a milky fluid, like strange udders on a poisoned bovine creature.

"Aww shite".
I’ve come to view grief as a gift. Not many people agree with that, but for me, it is very much of a bequest, the last present he ever gave me. I’ve always been a truth-seeker, always wanted to see what was beyond the veil of everyday reality. (If you’ve read any of my books, you can see the pattern. Each of my novels seeks to reveal the lies that hold our culture together, from so-called conspiracy theories to biological warfare, from human experimentation to old time gangsters. Despite the disparate stories and themes, they are all united by my need for the truth.)

The Grand Sophy by Georgette Heyer - Whenever I chance upon a discussion of Heyer's Regency romances, the impression that forms is of Jane Austen methadone. This isn't entirely an alluring description--it conjures images of an author who replicates the frothy surface of Austen's novels without dipping into the acid that lies just beneath it. In my first foray into Heyer's writing late last year, with Cotillion, that is indeed what I found, but Cotillion was also charming, effervescent fun, and its central romance was satisfyingly human and unsentimental, so I marked Heyer as an author worth returning to. Though it shares some superficial similarities with Cotillion--both novels involve a young woman arriving at the home of her fashionable London relatives, rearranging their lives for the better, and sweeping her dashing cousin off his feet--The Grand Sophy may not have been the ideal next step. For one thing, the novel is just starting to gear up for its home stretch, as the title character, who has been raised by her rich, eccentric diplomat father to be his hostess and housekeeper and has been shocking her relatives with her strong will and independent habits, starts seriously meddling in her family's affairs and scheming to separate her cousin Charles from the odious, mean-spirited prig he's become engaged to, when an evil Jewish moneylender turns up. Sophy's confrontation with, and ultimate triumph over, this character (for which read "agglomeration of ugly antisemitic stereotypes"), is one of the most viscerally unpleasant things I've ever read, but even so I might have managed to enjoy the novel around it if were not also at around this point that the novel's central romance begins to teeter.
For example, writing in first person means that your story is limited by their point of view. If the character could not possibly have seen it, it cannot exist in the narrative.

Flat sandals and a handbag with lots of room for essentials make travelling easy.

Whether or not we have nematodes, we're not going to worry too much right now. The garlic is still fine to eat, and as that same farmer pointed out, we're not using mechanical planting machines and other industrial means to plant it, so our problems are compounded less. Maybe we'll start growing for seed using the varieties of garlic we now have and not bring any more outside bulbs in.
“Anonymity on the Internet emboldens people, encouraging them to take on more extreme views than they might otherwise….The Internet also amplifies the extreme views, even though they might be in the minority, and virtual mobs form to cheer or jeer, which only help to accentuate the differences, polarise and inflame emotions further.”

Though his mother would gain culinary fame, it was his father who was the original Restaurant Man. And, like his dad, he’s obsessed with the cost of restaurant linens, relying on those square paper napkins you find on bars — or “bev naps,” in restaurant parlance — because they’re free: “When the staff is eating, I make them use the bev naps. I take them home and make my family use them at dinner. I clean the windshield of my truck with them.”

They do not wash the aprons too often, by the way.

A case in point: Faust's love scene with Marguerite happens on Kristallnacht, and soon after, instead of going to prison, Marguerite, being a Jew, gets carted off to a concentration camp (no mention of her poisoning her mother!). Then in the finale scene, she is seen on a pile of dead bodies while the choir sings it's beautiful refrain about her return to purity, salvation and ascension to heaven. Apart from this being an inappropriately Christian sentiment for a Jewish woman, when the crowd sings that she died because love led her astray, in the current staging it isn't true - she died because of her race, and the unthinkable evil of the Nazis. It could have made sense if her liaison with Faust had caused her to be found by the Nazis, but again the staging was so unclear at that point, that if this was the intention, it was lost. And lets get back to that scene - she's lying on a pile of bodies in Auschwitz, accompanied by music of unearthly beauty, bordering on religious kitsch because of the embarrassing piety of the sentiment and situation as presented by Berlioz. Yes it's a powerful image and deeply shocking, but is it meaningful or telling in any way? Again I have to demur.

Ella's grandmother is not welcoming, nor is the rambling old house is full of Things...and the library full of precious and valuable books, located in its own separate building, is not a place where Ella is encouraged to spend time.
It is such a remarkable and unspoiled place and the coastal scenery is so unique and spectacular. It is also Britain’s first designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).
I've had to really consciously 'let go' in lots of ways over the last few months. One of the hard things about being a single parent is not being able to discuss and debate changes - how much more freedom do I give her? I suppose none of us really know if we're getting it right. I'm thankful for the fact that we still get on well, still laugh together, and she still tells me stuff. I am hugely proud of her, did I ever mention that?

I wish Sol Campbell all the best in his future endeavors and I can only express my gratitude for his years of service to Arsenal and football at large.
It might be that the driver for Acutes to get smarter about BI is the competitive landscape, rather than the pre-White Paper regimen. If this is the case then patient-level costing Bi will need to progress to deliver patient-level revenue generation and patient-level contribution analysis – as is the case in industry. This will be supplemented with the Acutes setting their own quality KPIs, building on the QUIPP process and adjacent to PROMs, and they will no doubt look to set those that they can most easily deliver on (cynic!) or which might be the most easily measurable (fair!).
Here's what you need to know about this facial wash:
Some brands take years to mature from a mere trade mark or indicium of origin into a fully fledged promise. This promise can take many forms. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, this usually meant a guarantee that branded products are reliable, repairable, durable, cheap, or functionally efficient. Thereafter, the promise has increasingly adopted aspirational content: slogans such as ‘Be sociable, have a Pepsi’, ‘Happiness is a cigar called Hamlet’, ‘Reach out and touch someone’, ‘Just do it’, and ‘Don't be vague. Ask for Haig’ tell you nothing about the goods or services in question, but say more about the manner in which the consumer views, values, or wishes to promote himself.

Mouth feel is pretty thick. It's really syrupy and coating. This is an interesting barleywine. I believe that it's the first that I've ever had with Belgian yeast. It's a solid brew, but it is however, a strange one. That being said, the yeast is pretty mellow and luckily doesn't overpower the rest of the taste. It's background for the most part and later after warming, even though it becomes more apparent, it still lays low and that sweetness always shines the brightest. That, and the booze! I forgot that this was 12% until half way through when I looked at the bottle again. I'll be searching out everything Barleywine to find the best out there, I think I owe it to myself. Can Southern Tier Backburner ever be topped? Will I ever stop thinking about Berkshire's Holidale? Guess I'll find out, someday. There's really nothing I didn't like about this one though. It suits me well. Guess I'm becoming more accustomed to that Belgian yeast.
I can't believe September is almost over. The past few months have been a blur. It feels like it should still be mid-June, and we should be looking forward to a couple of hot months and a trip to the beach. But instead, it's in the mid-50's and low-60's, and the rainy wind is starting to cut through our sweatshirts. But, with the quick passing of days - rolling into weeks - rolling into months - rolling into seasons, also comes the small spark of excitement that is starting to take hold. It is still small, and at times indistinguishable, but it's there. It's the excitement that soon we'll see the finish line. It's still a ways off, but it's out there. Just over the horizon. We just have to stay strong, keep our heads down and our hearts faithful, and confront each day with a voracious desire to do whatever it takes to bring our little boy home, healthy and happy.
Based on statistical analysis of arrests in America, it is very likely that racial profiling does occur and that black males are particularly vulnerable to unfair profiling practices. It cannot be assumed however that every time a black male is arrested or subject to profiling that it is based on race, nor can it be assumed that race was a factor every time a crime is committed by a person of one race against another. Like all crimes, there must be sufficient evidence to support the accusation that a hate crime has occurred. It appears the media attention that this case has attracted has helped push the racial aspect of this affair farther than the evidence suggests.

"When I hear Mitt Romney say that he believes that Jesus is the Son of God–that he's the Christ, raised from the dead, that he's his Savior–that's good enough for me," Osteen said in an interview to air on CNN's "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer." Shame on Joel Osteen for being such a coward, plain and simple. Rather than tell the truth he would rather tell a bald face lie. Knowing darn well because someone knows Christ is God's son does not make them a Christian. The Scripture teaches Satan knows who Christ is but it doesn't make him a Christian. Joel Osteen should lose what little bit of credibility he have left among true followers of Christ, for trying to push Mormonism as being Christianity. It is not Christianity Joel. Mormonism does not adhere to the teachings of Christ and therefore it is not Christianity.

One sees that this is all new. This is parking area and to the west of it will be soccer fields, lots of them. Soccer is very popular and even though there was some protest about them being built on the wetlands, there was never any real question about the project going ahead. The mayor needed to pass the bond and he does want to get reelected after all. The mountain in the background is Antelope Island rising out of the Great Salt Lake. The black smoke is an anomaly. While we don’t lay claim to very clean air, this smoke has to be a fire of some sort.

Even in India today, in ordinary households you have this kind of discussion. Some people are heavily into Vaidika Karma. They follow rituals to the best of their understanding and ability every day. Some people only follow it for weddings and funerals. Others try to understand the meaning of these rituals and try to do what is relevant to the present times. Some abstract the philosophy.

I’m not asking for a Malaysian MP for the UK. Attractive though the idea may be, that is probably a step too far for our country at this point. All I’m asking for is the right to cast my vote at the Malaysian High Commission in London, or via the post, or at wherever the nearest polling station is without having to pay for a flight back home.
There was a choice of plantain or potato chips with each sandwich. The plantains (not pictured) were much tastier than the potato chips which appeared to be nothing more than an entire family-sized bag of Lays dumped on the side of each plate.
After Clark's death in 1991 -- after years of drug and alcohol abuse, he died of a heart attack at age 46 -- McGuinn claimed that it was his idea to write a song about an airplane journey, and that he contributed lyrics to the song. But McGuinn's claim seems to be viewed with skepticism by most.
Apple prizes elegance and simplicity in the iPhone above all else. That’s a major reason that users can’t upgrade the storage or replace the batteries on their iPhones (it’s possible to get replacement iPhone batteries, but they’re have to be replaced by a skilled repairperson). Android, on the other hand, is open to user customization, meaning that users can change both phones’ memory and battery.
At first, my only goal was to learn about the publishing industry and I followed every writer/publisher/agent/editor I could find. I did a lot of listening and a little interacting. It didn’t take long to become a part of the community, but the key here is creating relationships—not just promoting your latest book.
In fact, the world would be a borderline utopia.
We’ve made a barren land productive, and shown those other barren nations that were willing to listen how to do the same. We’ve revived our ancient language of prayer and molded it to meet every modern linguistic imperative. And the revival of Hebrew is emblematic of the revival of Israel, a vibrant nation built on ancient roots that we have shaped to meet every modern challenge – shaped so successfully as to serve not only as a refuge for those in life-threatening need, but as a destination of choice for those with the flair, courage and will to become part of the remarkable flux of Jewish sovereign history.
One of the biggest challenges when decorating your home on PEI, is the lack of sources available to us. What may seem like a simple afternoon shopping around Ikea to our big city counterparts, would be a dream come true for some of us island design enthusiasts.
"I'm not," he snapped. "I just... I think... It might be best if you covered up a bit more when we get into Vessit. We don't want to draw attention to ourselves." A bead of sweat tickled as it slipped down the back of his neck. Still, better than answering the question she could have asked. Rel turned back to the path and started walking again.
Tragically, many congregations of the historic mainline denominations are shrinking and disappearing from the religious landscape. This will continue for the foreseeable future because they are failing to help people make the connection between people’s spiritual lives with their real everyday lives. There is a currently a huge void and lack of vision for evangelism in reaching out to people with Jesus’ Gospel message.
Spielberg isn’t the only one coming out with a Lincoln film this year, yet the president may be the only similarity between the two films as Timur Bekmambetov (say that three times fast!) is bringing Seth Grahame-Smith’s ridiculously fun novel to life. June is uncharacteristically light on action heavy hitters this summer with Prometheus being one of the only films that will cause a splash at the box office, which leaves the door open for this latest vampire flick. While AL:VH may not be on par with Avengers it is sure to make buko bucks as it brings in fans of the source material and moviegoers who just want to see our most famous president kick some vampire booty. Already fans are buzzing about the film on all the social media outlets with over two months to go until the film’s release. This is wonderful for a film whose biggest star is Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who is unfortunately still far from A-lister status. Anticipation can only go up from here!
And when writing is going well, I get to experience some of that. I think that’s the thrill for me.

The Theory of Evolution is an interesting theory, and I am not saying it could be untrue. But it still lacks just as much evidence as creationism. Ignorance is saying I know, reason is saying it’s a possibility so lets see if we can put it to the test. Listen to yourself, your being irrational and ignorant. Just because someone believes in creationism does not make them a ignorant and stupid individual. Just as much as someone who wants to believe in evolution is not an ignorant or stupid individual. Its the one who is unable to recognize either as a theory and a belief and unable to show respect for reason. You do not know which is true. You’ve only decided which one you think is true.
This coupled with modern readers' demand for more plot and character driven stories is likely to turn off readers before giving it a chance. Do I think "Sirens of Titan" is a good novel? Yes. Do I think it's still a classic? Barely. Do I think it will remain a classic? It all depends on further developments in storytelling. If the emphasis remains on plot twists and compelling characters, for whom you'd want to root for, then probably not.

The only problem with the walk is the final .2 miles.... there are no sidewalks into the school. Thankfully, there is a police officer who stops traffic for us to cross a big country road, but, man, entering the school property is high stakes. Drivers don't expect a walker.... I have not seen a single person walk their kid to school there, even though there are several neighborhoods close by. I can only assume that people don't want to risk fighting the traffic as a pedestrian.

So, like I had said before, I was doing amazing on WW and really loving it (and I still love the program), but my head has been playing major games with me lately and food is my weapon of choice. I'm still down in weight but my relationship with food has been bizarre to say the least. I have been going way overboard on Easter candy, for weeks now. I've been eating, to either stuff emotions, stuff fears or just plain stuff, I'm not sure which one it is! And I sit hear completely concious of it all and almost laughing at myself in a way because it just seems so absurd, yet I cannont jump out of the cycle. I'm caught up right in the middle of it, along for the ride, wanting to get off and yet strangley not at the same time. It's obvious that it is feeding (no pun intended) some huge need in me, I just can't figure out where that need comes from. I know the need is to obsess about my body and my weight, I'm just not sure why.
As though there wasn't enough washing I needed to do today, dh noticed the box of 6 month baby clothing had been upended in our leaky garage, and was water-logged. There was also a mouldy box of linen, which I will sort through and wash. And yet another box of books that looked like they would be ruined. Luckily, all but 2 were salvageable, and we also foudn J'-Man's Capsela construction building toys. Princess has had a lot of fun with those.
While we were away, we also thought about recycling. On several of our breakfast trays we had jams packaged in small glass jars that had pop-top metal lids. Those same lids were on small glass bottles of fruit juice, also on the breakfast trays. We washed the jars and bottles and brought them all home to be used for small storage jars or for little bottles of sauce that I'll probably make up sometime during the year. They were irresistible to me - glass, small and capable of being sterilised in a water bath and sealed for storage in a cupboard. Gold!

Another reason why bad days might occur is to help a person recognize how the universe works. Last night I started feeling a bit frustrated and my inner senses were tingling that a storm was coming. So perhaps bad days occur for that reason, to exercise our inner senses and help us become more confident in our ability to understand nature.

GVP Pro 1800 Hair Dryer ($35 at Sally Beauty Supply): My $20 hair dryer from years ago was starting to spark when I used it. Instead of risking my hair starting on fire, I went to Sally's and found this guy. GVP is a product line that produces generic products modeled after higher priced hair products and tools. While I do not used the brand name dryer (I believe it was a Chi hair dryer), I'm very satisfied with this hair dryer. It dries my hair quickly, it isn't incredibly loud, and my hair is shinier. If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive hair dryer, I would recommend this one.
Those words, even taken out of the God-based context in which I received them, are pretty special. And I have always remembered them. I guess they’re a more poetic way of saying ‘what doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger’.

Underpronation or Supination Other people under pronate, or supinate. This means that the feet roll in less than 15% and most of the shock is absorbed by the outside (lateral) of their feet. When they push off the smaller toes do most of the work. This puts extra stress on the foot and can cause iliotibial band syndrome of the knee, Achilles tendinitis and plantar fasciitis.
This book is an effort to reconstruct the story of the colonial world at the Wilsonian moment. Most historians have told the story of the Paris Peace Conference from the inside out, focusing on the views and actions of the leaders of the great powers of Europe and North America. This book aims to tell it from the outside in, from the perspectives of peoples who were on the margins of the peace conference and of international society more generally. The period on which the narrative centers opened with the U.S. entry into the war in April 1917, when it began to appear that Wilson would play a major role at the peace table, and ended with the conclusion of the Versailles Treaty in June 1919. During this time, Woodrow Wilson’s vision for the postwar world was disseminated to a growing global audience, and, when peace came, colonial peoples moved to claim their place in that world on the basis of Wilson’s proclamations. The crucial period — the Wilsonian moment itself — lasted from the autumn of 1918, when Allied victory appeared imminent and Wilson’s principles seemed destined to shape the coming new world order, until the spring of 1919, as the terms of the peace settlement began to emerge and the promise of a Wilsonian millennium was fast collapsing.

I’m specifically interested in cognitive enhancement. This kind of enhancement would try to improve how the human mind acquires, processes, stores and retrieves information. (More generally, we can speak of “neural enhancement” which would also target emotional and motivational capacities. Drawing a dividing line between cognitive capacities and these other capacities is difficult and, perhaps, pointless since the same basic philosophical issues arise in relation to enhancing both and, indeed, to enhancing any human capacity).

Here’s what we notice from the story: Simba didn’t realize he had an enemy, and that he was in a battle for his very life. His fear of facing what happened paralyzed his ability to choose wisely. When we’re unwilling to see, we’re then left to use whatever coping strategies we can to stay alive. The problem is that in so doing, we wall off part of our hearts, just as Simba did, because the pain is too great to face. Then, we deaden the desire to hope again.
It is still not “politically correct” to admit that one votes for “The Danish People’s Party” , but when alone in the ballot box, people do so nevertheless. Including a lot of my friends from the so-called “leftist parties”. I don’t know if Lars Hedegaard does so, but recently the party has made great efforts to emphasize its anti-Islamic nature — as opposed to racism. But first and foremost it has a firm stance against the EU-quagmire.
The crying and the lack of sleep led to a cold last week, but sickness I can deal with. What's harder to manage, for me personally, is the knowledge that your emotions are still fragile, that they still have ragged edges around them, and that the person you're with just might say something penetrating enough -- "wow, you look exhausted" -- to trigger tears.
But despite my recent increased effort to post more often, my hits have gone down. And before you start telling me that "you need to read and comment on other blogs and join other blogs to get more readers," I've been doing a lot of that lately.
Bull-SHIT. That's not partnering, and it's not parenting. It's possessiveness, because we are assuming that the stuff that we bought is ours. It's a restriction of learning, because we are restricting the ways in which they play. It's "head" parenting, as opposed to "heart parenting, because we are projecting our expectations onto our kids and assuming that we are entitled to have them respect our stuff.
If this teaching thing doesn’t work out, I’m going to start my own brothel. I’m pretty alright at teaching drawing, but I’m certainly just as great at whipping up Pasta Puttanesca for a spicy, tangy, rather filling supper. In case you’ve never given ear to the legend, the story goes that the ‘working’ ladies would stew a batch of Pasta Puttanesca, come evening fall, in order to attract their customers. The idea is that such a recipe, (including powerfully pungent ingredients like anchovies, capers, and olives), would flood the streets with a tantalizing aroma that would lead the noses of men (or women) right to the brothel door step. I’ll tell you what: it made Josh come-a-runnin’! He worked at the table while it cooked and I’m pretty sure he licked, clean, the pan it was cooked in.

I ran into Michael once at the pizza shop in town. It was the day after Christmas, and I was home visiting my parents. I saw him as soon as I opened the glass door and the jingle bell jingled. He stood at the counter, holding a baby bundled in blue. The sight washed over me like a damn wave that you never see coming until it’s too late and you’re face down eating sand. And just as you try to spit out the sand and stand up you get knocked over again by the damn hot pizza smell that transports you back in time. Back to the night that you ate pizza in the corner booth that still has your names carved in the wood. The night you got drunk on the six-pack you took from your dad’s stash in the garage. The night you made out in the woods and fell asleep naked intertwined like pretzels under a crescent moon that peeked through the trees.

All in all it was nice for a Sunday afternoon. Enjoyed 2lbs of delicious crawfish, some sausage that wasn’t so hot, potatoes, and corn. They put a big ol’ hunk of garlic and some mushrooms that i had to move out of the way on the plate too. I don’t know about you all who have enjoyed this Louisiana delicacy, but I’ve never had it with mushrooms before. It wasn’t like “back home” but it should hold me over til my next visit.
If that doesn’t work, we can accuse the other of not reasoning properly, of ‘being irrational’, in order to disqualify what they say. We can try to say, “we will not listen to you when you talk like that; for us to listen, you must talk in this way”. Lyotard, in The Postmodern Condition, called this ‘terrorism’; I prefer to call it a form of symbolic violence.

It all started a month or so ago when I found out I would have to get a lisans in order to run the Büyük Atatürk Koşusu, aka the Great Ataturk Race. I would translate this word lisans, but I'm not sure if it means a license, a diploma or something else. All you French speakers out there, let me know what it means in French. Then I'll maybe be able to give you a good translation in Turkish. I learned that getting a lisans to be an athlete is not hard, but it does help to know someone. My second time going to the Ministry of Youth and Sports I knew someone! One of the guys I run with just happened to be waiting on paperwork. We chatted. I told him what I needed my lisans for. He gave my paperwork to the guy behind the counter. And ten minutes later I had my lisans and the necessary information for the race. In Turkey it really is all about who you know.I realize I look a bit scary in said lisans. And no, Ferdi is not some weird sort of disease or even a club name. It means I run independently.

(at this point, I was slightly suspicious. If she knew he was coming over, why didn’t she answer the door herself? But anyways…)

And as my heart was breaking a little bit for my son, he looked up at me with a big smile and said, "And you picked me, right?" "Yes, Michael, we picked you."
I grew up loving the Village Voice. Nat Hentoff taught me how to listen to Billie Holiday. Jack Newfield politically baptized me through his stories and recollections of Bobby Kennedy. During the 80′s and 90′s, the Village Voice was also one of those rare mainstream publications in which the Black and Brown mind, body, and spirit were routinely celebrated. I read the Village Voice to understand myself better as a woman of color in America.
To be honest, though, I already find my patience with the beta wearing thin. I guess I’m just not much of a tester, but all the glitches and failures get tiresome fast.

A few weeks ago my closest coworker defended his dissertation. Proud of him and happy for him, I called on the way in to work to double check what his favorite donut was before I stopped and got treats for everyone at the donut shop.
This tart tastes a bit like the strawberry and cream but more mellow and sweet, I think the people who love white chocolate will be love it. It's both refreshing and fulfill, just imagine the cool tart with a warm cup of tea on the afternoon, well, I think you might want to try it now, haha.
Unreal, right? Can you believe we actually used to able to use that ping pong table? I am so glad that none of it can be blamed on me - I was gone for 6 months! :) Can't you just that garage full of great organizational tools like bins and pegboards and such? It will look SO great when its finished!
The door knob to my daughter’s room is always ice cold. I’m usually carrying towels or trash or cups so I dread the touch of the knob. When I see the door isn’t closed all the way I breathe easier. After I knocked twice, it occurred to me she had to be asleep or listening to her iPod. I ignored this realization and acted like a lame parent. I bumped open the door with a butt cheek and there she was, dancing and singing and enjoying whatever her ear buds were offering. Her look of surprise and disdain transported me.
I give birth to your truth, ideas, true desires, passions and purpose. (aka the doula part of my name lol )
There are great blogs and bloggers out there who do offer valuable feedback: Clarissa Draper's chapter critique, for one. And there are always beta readers, writers' groups and plenty of forums to turn to for help.
Abby gazed past Matt’s sheep sheds, scanning the pastures for a lone female figure, but only the ewes and their lambs grazed there, peacefully unaware of the turmoil inside the largest barn. The trees along Cedar Creek sparkled gold and yellow and orange in the sunrise, the most striking panorama of color they’d displayed in years–as though they’d known only a beautiful day would do for this wedding. Autumn always stirred something deep inside her, but Abby felt oddly bereft . . . ferhoodled about the day’s details and the way she couldn’t make them right and mend hurt feelings.
Fast forward a few years, my hubs is making more money, I am at home with a 3 month baby and a 3 year old and we are all happy as clams. The 3 year old goes to preschool part-time, spends time with his grandparents on a weekly basis, and I get time with him to explore parks and playgrounds. (Our weather has been A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!) The laundry gets done, the house stays relatively clean, there are less to-do piles and clutter, and the grocery shopping gets done. Can I just express to you how wonderful it is to grocery shop mid-week? NO ONE IS AT THE STORE. I can't give that up.

A wildly popular series for kids, (now available on DVD) is Horrible Histories, filled with gruesome/alluring details like the fact it took two swings to lop off Mary Queen of Scots’ head. The series has sold 11 million copies in the UK and 20 million worldwide, with the accompanying books translated into 31 languages.
It will win no friends, and will provoke the self-righteous wrath of, well, the self-righteous, letter-writing wrathful, a species which never fails to contaminate almost every debate in Irish life with its sneers and its moral superiority. It will also probably enrage some of the finest men in Irish life, like John O’Shea, of Goal; and the Finucane brothers, men whom I admire enormously. So be it.

1. It's still a LOT of work. This isn't an issue I have with the product itself, but I just have to give you this warning! We spent 13 hours slaving away last Sunday, and then probably another 5 hours throughout the rest of the week . It's a huge undertaking, but completely worth it in my opinion! I have never refinished cabinets the "old-fashioned" way, but from what I hear it takes MUCH longer.
i for one am fine! no regrets and no hangover. we had a great time sitting, eating, drinking and visiting. it really is one of the highlights of living along the parade route, at some point, everyone comes to you. all you need to do is smile and wave back! i would have posted some pictures, but after the first one, they just seemed to go downhill.

Directions: Cast on 36 stitches using 3.25 needles.K1, P1 to end of row. Repeat this row 7 times. Change to 3.75mm needles and K2, P2 rib. Work 4 rows increasing at each end of every row (44 sts). Continue until work measures 15 cms. Decrease 1 st at each end of every row until 28 sts remain. Decrease 1 st. in middle of next row (27 sts.) Leave on needle. Make second side the same. Transfer the 54 sts from both pieces to 3 of the set of 4 3.25mm needles.(18 sts on each.) and work a round neck in K1 P1 rib for 10 rows. Cast off. Stitch up sides to decreasing to 27sts (opening for flipper). Add elastic to the top and bottom to prevent the penguins getting out of them. Top: 15cm of elastic; bottom 17 cm (knots allowed). Flat elastic okay.
Contact with somebody who is honest and believes that you are honest as well, brings the best of you and this is an amazing feeling. It makes you relax, enjoy the moment in the first place and following generates the desire to ‘pay back’ the ‘treat’. It brings human interaction in a higher lever of quality. As far as tango is concerned, it is obvious that you dance better with somebody you feel well and you are familiar to. Of course an excellent tango can be more ‘aggressive’ or ‘esoterical’ driven either by seduction, or the coincidence of the special moment; but the most enjoyable dance (at least from my point of view) is when you are possessed by positive feelings, familiarity and respect for your partner. When you want to share with him another step, another tango, another tanta, when you want to stay in the abrazo and try to overwhelm him with all your positive energy and feelings. This is the magic of tango…. (or at least some of it!)

I've owned and given away, thrown away, or sold, hundreds if not thousands of books. I've absorbed Dickens, Kundera, Proust, Ian Banks, Madhur Jaffrey, Murakami, Thoreau, and Beckett. I've read the poetry of Billy Childish, Bukowski, Hugo Williams, Wendy Cope, Garrison Keillor and McGough. I read biographies, novels, poetry, newspapers, magazines, short stories and fairy tales.

I'm sure you were all glued to the TV Sunday afternoon watching the final. If you weren't, you missed an entertaining bit of soccer. It went scoreless for 113 minutes until the two teams traded goals in 71 seconds.
The next of many differences I present in this article is Heavenly Father and Jesus being one in the same. As Christians we believe the Bible when it tells us that Jesus Christ is God in flesh. To take away Jesus’ identity and place him next to another god with flesh and bones is definitely a different gospel.

To finish of I added some magnolia string gems if you want to see how how I made this card pop over to my blog lollydollycrafts where I am also running a Candy in the lead up to my 50th birthday Candy gulp. I still feel young inside its just the outside which doesnt quite agree with me lol So thats all for now tune in for our next challenge its going to be a fab one hope you all have a great weekend.
In the fat from the bacon and Guanciale, sauté the sprouts for about 2 minutes, adding them in stages so that they wilt a bit between additions. Add the crushed red pepper. Cook 2 more minutes, turning frequently. Don’t worry if they start to brown a little but DO NOT OVERCOOK! The sprouts should keep much of their green color.

You may have noticed the "Why Not Train A Child" button on the side of my blog. If not, let me draw your attention to it now and to the issue it represents. The book To Train Up A Child, written by Micheal Pearl is, simply put, a child abuse manual. In the book, he tells parents to use a plumbing supply line to beat their children into submission, starting as young as 6 months old, and claims that this is Biblical advise. Several children have died as a result of their parents following the methods in this book. I could go on, but thanks to the work of Linda at Why Not Train A Child, I can just send you there where many bloggers have covered the book in depth.

The result was that canvassing door-to-door typically raises turnout by about 6% but the estimated effect of canvassing was slightly higher for unaffiliated voters. The experiment also looked at whether asking the question “Can I count on you to vote on November 3rd?” had an effect and concluded that it did increase the effectiveness of canvassing.
For another example, here is a quick background paper I made with this technique but this time I used an orange multiliner SP to draw the outlines. I like how much softer it is than the black outline, especially for background paper. I'm going to use this for something I'm doing in my duck-themed bathroom. Cute, quick, and I know the colors will match perfectly.

I was a major screw-up in high school, and most people never thought I'd amount to much of anything. But the Principal at the time, Mr. Martin, always believed in me. At least once a week, I would find myself in his office for one disciplinary problem or another. He would look me in the eyes and say "Jeff, you have so much potential, if you would just stop screwing around and use your brain."
“We’ll take any port in the storm,” he laughed.

The movie attempts to give a “lesson” to viewers on what happens when you whore-yourself out (or fake whore-yourself-out in this case) and how people can be judgmental/start rumors/yadda yadda yadda. The message to me was skewed by the terrible plot/acting…yikes!
Presence is also the place of perfect health and the longer we can reside there, the more quantifiable our results. To remain present is to relieve ourselves of any attachment to the past or future which in turn creates the homeostatic and energetic balance necessary to achieve wellness. Most all dis-ease is a result of emotional imbalance…most all emotional imbalance is a result of past or future attachment. To achieve total wellness, we must achieve total Presence. This is the final frontier.

Took a couple hours off so my sister and I could check out our first craft fair today. :) It was at my old high school, which was uber weird. -__- But nostalgic nightmares aside, we had a blast and I ended up buying some items from several vendors and finally had a first hand experience of being in a craft fair.
During all this time nobody dared to move, for we did not know at what moment our perilous support might over-turn, throwing us all into the sea. The buoyant air was gradually leaking from under the boat, lowering us further and further into the water.

Once actually in Bulgaria, everything changed. Houses that had appeared so perfect on the screen turned out to be located in deserted villages or on dreadful roads. All that time spent imagining period features and pools would have been better spent googleing the villages in which the houses were situated, if only the agents had mentioned the location. Suddenly, all previous research became irrelevant, as the parameters had changed. Buyers realised it was more about the village itself, its proximity to towns, winter access, good roads and honest neighbours.
Were I to be charitable I would suggest that those advocating mass inter-breeding share the demented belief that by genetically engineering a huge homogeneous mono-race we will irradiate conflict, others might suggest that their motives are far less benevolent and that they are fully aware of the disaster they are inciting.

Is it because I don't want to admit the truth to myself or is it because I haven't found my own truth yet? Both is true. I grew up in an environment in which I learned it's easier to please everyone rather than listen to what I want. I wasn't allowed to want. I was expected to do everything right according to someone else's rules. Don't rock the boat. Don't push the envelope. Conform. To do otherwise would mean silent treatments, disapproving looks, the tut-tuts when I lifted one finger out of place, stepped out of line. Or, it meant hearing how difficult, overly independent and unworthy I had become. After years of doing what is expected I'm struggling to find my authentic self. I'm learning bit by bit as I realize that my laugh is mine and not the unattractive guffaw I've been told. I realized that while I find the usual things amusing, it's the off-colour humour that really gets me going. I've discovered that it's okay to say no and to go about doing what I like with no apologies and without looking to others for confirmation that I'm doing things right, and according to whose rules.

The police captain had actually disobeyed the orders of the mayor, who said, “The rally is peaceful. There’s no need to disperse it.” The police captain acted on his own, marched right up to the crowd and said, “You must disperse,” and the speaker said, “But we are peaceful.” And he said, “You must disperse anyway.” And as the speaker was coming down from the wagon, someone — and to this day, we don’t know who it was — threw a bomb that landed into the ranks of the police. One officer was killed immediately. Six others later died.

One of the main reasons why Americans give much, much more to charity than any other country is that they enjoy tax benefits from doing so. But, as the Chief Executive of the Charities Aid Foundation points out, this is not a tax dodge. It is genuine philanthropy.

I constantly listen to my customers for the colors they like and want in their rooms. My Studio is my happy place where I can dance with fabric and create from my heart.
Lately, this is what’s been happening to me. A lot of “gas lighting”. They’re doing things to me to make me want to doubt my sanity, but I’m well aware of what is going on. I didn’t wake up yesterday and take a pill for “stupid.” I’m know what’s happening.

New goals on the horizon? I have a few. First, I want to begin running longer distances. After finishing the Country Music Mini Marathon, I’ve got the fever to start half marathon training. There are a few races un the fall I’m interested in. So, I’m going to start training tomorrow, May 1st. Suggestions from other runners would be appreciated!!!
Everything that was ever solved was solved because somebody was willing to face it. It all starts with the courage to face the facts. In facing the facts that you had always tried to avoid, for the first time you are looking at life square in the eye. Face the brutal facts of life courageously; knowing very well that something can be done about it. Escapism is not for people like you and me. What must be faced, must be faced, sooner than later.

Closer to home, what does this mean for us? Professionally, we know that if we are not able to communicate and work with people from different backgrounds, then our days are numbered. I almost wonder if having a partner from a different background gives you an edge nowadays. But life is not just in the office. When you look around now at areas that were once predominantly made up of people from a certain racial background, you will realise that in the last 20 years, the community has changed. Your neighbour, who was once your grandmother’s best friend and spoke the same language as her could now be someone from a completely different background. The smell of grilled meats coming from their house could now be replaced with the smell of incense.
Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot. Saute 3 cups of chopped leeks (white and light green parts only) and 4 tablespoons fresh chopped thyme in the oil. Make sure leeks are soft but still slightly crisp. Remove half of leek mixture and set aside. Add 1.25 pounds broccoli crowns and 3 cups of vegetable broth. Boil covered for 8-10 minutes. Cool slightly and puree in batches in a blender, returning pureed mixture to the pot each time. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve in large bowls, sprinkling reserved leeks and thyme on top.

He went back to tippity-tapping and I opened my laptop and see what'd been happening while I slept. As I checked out blogs and made new friends on Facebook, I kept thinking that I really should get up and do my morning speed-walk. I know myself and my shortcomings only too well to put it off. As Hubby got up and went downstairs and I promised myself I'd just read this one last article and then get up.

I have practiced many types of yoga (hatha, vinyasa, kundalini, even ashtanga) for many years, but never gone to Mysore practice (this is like a dirty little confession). For me, fear has always circulated around Mysore practice. Fear of the unknown… Am I going to feel bad if I show up late? Will I miss the opening invocation? Can I even remember the opening invocation? Will I even remember any of the primary series? The answers: yes/no (I’m not late, because practice begins anytime before 8, but I still feel a little bad letting cold air in the studio) yes (I missed it), no (I kind of remember because I try to practice it everyday, but I can’t remember a karaoke song if the lyrics are on the screen in front of me), no (I would like to blame it on my mantra to “still the mind” that I end up in such a deep state of concentration on the present moment that I can’t remember where to go next, but again, I can’t remember words to a song if they are on the screen in front of me). But does it matter, no… just practice. Showing up matters, getting into the bind, is not the thing of substance. Remembering where I am in the series and what comes next, may come eventually, but I have the compassionate and loving Johnny Haag to assist with a smile or the gorgeous Catherine Such I can peek at and she’ll give me a hint as to my next move.

Saturday brought some early thunderstorms and it was lightly raining when it was time to head out but it wasn't going to stop our kids from running. Their anticipation and excitement was great! Sarah kept saying she wanted to win but I told her it was more about having fun and doing something healthy for her body than it was about winning. Every kid that ran got a medal, a t-shirt and LOTS of cheers from the crowd.

One guy, we'll call him Big Shot because he bought the other 3 at the bar a round of drinks. I don't know how well he knew the other 2, my guess is not well, but I think he wanted some company and these other 2 didn't seem to be in the position to turn down a free drink. All 3 of them reminded me of the homeless dudes who used to sleep in the parking lot of mine and Wes' old business in downtown Wichita.

I've never been a big fan of Valentine's Day. It just seems like one of those invented holidays, created solely for the financial benefit of companies in the greeting card and floral industries. It seems to me I should be telling the people I love how much I love them every day, not just on Valentine's Day. But maybe that's just me.

Among my circle of aquaintances I am one of the few who is an adamant supporter of breastfeeding. I use cloth diapers. I put marigold tea on my little girl’s mosquito bites. I wanted very much to have a waterbirth and railed against the universe when it became medically necessary for me to have a c-section. Both times! (Ugh! I’m getting frustrated just thinking about it!). I have an inordinate fondness for very long skirts and dresses (though, admittedly this has more to do with covering up my hamhockesque legs than with any kind of social statement). They roll their eyes and (not always) patiently listen while I talk about the evils of the political establishment and I’m quite certain that they talk behind my back about whether or not I’ve had my children vaccinated. (I could tell, but it’s more fun to keep people guessing). Those closest to me always knew I was a hippie at heart, forever wandering the earth in search of….. well…. I’m not really sure. But I had fun wandering! 10 years ago I married a guy who totally gets it. When I have a bad headache he touches my feet and tones for me. When I had trouble with my pregnancy he enrolled me in an energetic balancing program. He’s the one who told me about the marigolds.

It isn’t just about going out and buying a red pen. Or fifty. If you have time, they say rewriting from scratch is best, but that isn’t always feasible. You don’t have to do whole cloth rewrite, but read it out loud and see where you catch yourself. When you do it, your readers will, too. You are your own best critic, so use your power. Read it to someone else if you can.
I didn’t need to say anything before giving a little push, and sliding my penis inside of her. Yes, without a condom. No, she wasn’t on the pill. Yes, we got pretty good at the “pull-out method.” Yes, we had a few “I’m late” scares in our relationship. No, I never got her pregnant. I tried to think of ways to describe this, but there’s not really any good ones. It was wet, smooth, not loose, and felt really good. Good luck finding someone who can describe what sex feels like for a guy better than that.

Dr. Hung adds that there is no measure to treat this disease to the very roots. Doctors can help deal with anaemia and skin wounds, and in some cases they can perform bone marrow transplant.

The secular news network ABC calls it “graphic and harsh” and “hard-core porn.” A tale of a young innocent girl with an older man who teaches her sexual submission with pain and bondage. The question that has news channels buzzing is “why?” Why are a generation of young moms, raised as feminists, sexually free, and economically empowered drawn to a story of a girl who gives away all of her rights to a man? While ’50 Shades of Grey’ is the latest and most shocking example, Newsweek’s recent cover story, “Spanking Goes Mainstream,” author Katie Roiphe looks at the cultural trend of bright young women willingly engaged in BDSM relationships: 50 Shades of Grey, Lena Dunham’s HBO series Girls and even the wedding night of teen heart throbs Bella and Edward in the 4th Twilight movie.

Even Toepfer's most prestigious academic prizes and scholarships that he financed are named after men foundational to the German green movement. The Hanseatic Goethe Prize, dedicated to outstanding European scholarship, is named after Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832). Goethe is considered by many to be the father of German Romanticism. Today, Romanticism is known as environmentalism. The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in New York is named after naturalist Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859). Humboldt is the German father of a volkisch indigenous environmentalism.

A vendor of a residential property must pay any household charge, late payment fee and late payment interest due on the property and give a certificate of discharge, exemption or waiver in respect of each liability date during the vendor’s ownership to a purchaser on or before the sale or transfer can be completed.The Household Charge is just an interim measure to be put in place until a full property tax system is worked out.To register for payment you will need to complete a statutory declaration which will require the following information:name of the owner of the residential property (in the case of multi-owners only one name is required),address for correspondence, address of the residential property for which payment is being made, personal public service number (PPSN) of the owner of the property, tax reference number of the owner where the owner is a

No one wakes up in the morning one day and decides to become an armed robber. It is a gradual process that requires some experience and desensitizing.

So, where does this leave us? Well, it leaves us “normal”, somewhat sane, peace-seeking people in an awkward situation. Trust me. When 12-21-12 passes and these crazies are left safely hiding behind a tree… they are going to be mad as hell. If you decide to tell them that Mayans are “south of the border”, oh, better you than me. Whatever, when they realize that all the money that could have been spent on Nascar tickets, 80′s band reunion shows, bottom shelf whiskey, lottery tickets, muscle shirts, etc. has been blown on canned food and gas masks!? We will all soon suffer the reality of armed men in full ghillie suits jumping out at us on the bread aisle of Wal-Mart, men in Mad Max gear in a ’68 Ranger tearing through our front lawn demanding women, gasoline, and glue; and of course shooting excess ammo at anything that can walk, stagger, or roll. And then tack on their poor, dumb, probably barefoot and pregnant wives staggering around the streets asking anyone and everyone for direction and purpose in life? Dear God… we’re all in for it. Much less our local grocers repossessing and reselling that old canned food to offset gas prices for shipping? We’ll all be sick and crazy before it’s over.
Applicant Julie White argued that the word "Mohawk" is not a close approximation of the name of the St. Regis Band of Mohawk Indians, and that it does not refer uniquely or unmistakably to that Band (citing GOOGLE references to Mohawk Mountain, Mohawk College, Mohawk State Forest, and the like). She also claimed to be a Native American and a member of the St. Regis Band of Mohawk Indians of New York, and also an employee of a company that manufactures and sells cigarettes under a license granted by the St. Regis Band.

I have very clear memories of my band Bigger Thomas playing a few shows with Mephiskapheles. One particularly memorable show was at The Court Tavern in New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1990 or 1991 where they turned a initially passive audience who were unfamiliar with them into a heaving mass of thrashing bodies. It was quite a sight and one that the band re-created night after night whereever they played.

Something else I did differently: I had 2 Tylenol at about mile 65 instead of Advil, to reduce swelling, especially in my feet. I had two more at mile 90. I didn't have any more pain relievers for another 35 hours. (I don't like to use them). During the race, I also kept up with my electrolytes with SUCCEED! capsules, as needed. Knowing when and how often to take them is a good thing. For me, it's based on sweat output and hand swelling. I don't usually get to the point of calf cramps to realize I need electrolytes. I also drank about 4 bottles of Clip2 Sports drink before switching completely to water within the first 35 miles. (I alternated between water and Clip2 to that point).
The Reagan administration in presenting and pursuing the passing of their first federal budget in 1981 looked to cut taxes, and cut spending in order to reduce the deficit and balance the budget. Reagan’s economic solution was a program entitled “America’s New Beginning”; a expansive program that would cut taxes, and spending across the board including social programs in order to reduce the swelling deficit, and infuse the lagging economic situation with life. The 1982 deficit was estimated to reach $109 billion.

Not something that meets the hoity-toity hipster requirements for approval in academia.

But in terms of pure competitive advantage, all of the many American freedoms and cultural incentives to be innovative, be entrepreneurial, build a business, or go to college to create a career do not change one iota the sclerotic inability of government to urgently and productively invest for the common future.

At the Afterlife Academy of Exceptionally Dark Arts, Lily Fielding is a measly trainee who dreams of one day becoming a Savior—those who visit vampire-infested high schools and put down the undead with their deadly crossbows. When Lily and her classmates Alice and Cara begin their latest assignment, it seems like just another run-of-the-mill gig: they’re to simply spot the Vamplayer—part vampire, part player—identify the popular girl he’s set his sights on, and befriend her before the Vamplayer can turn her to do his bidding. Before long, however, the Vamplayer sets his sights on Lily's friends, and she is left to face the threat alone while protecting her friends from the dark forces she has sworn to resist.

We have now been here for five months, if you can believe it. We can’t, the time has passed pretty quickly for us. We are settled into our house, into school, and sports. I can’t say that the boys are completely happy to be here now, but they are definitely adjusting. It helps that they leave for school at 7:30 and don’t return until after 4 PM. That leaves little time for brooding and complaining. School is a good thing.

I would guess that the cornerstone of their relationship was the total absence of jealously. The Count was perfectly free to pursue any virgins her fancied, even if it meant going on extended vacations with limited opportunities for correspondence. And his feral spouses didn’t hesitate to sink their fangs into any stray man-flesh that wandered into the castle grounds. The Count, indeed, often played the pander to their grisly debaucheries.
Just been in bed an hour when called out at 9 pm to proceed to Iron Cross with a couple of the guns. Went to the Wagon lines & from there on past the canal. I was with A Sub gun & all went well until we reached the Iron Cross roads. Here the drivers of the team took too wide a sweep to miss a shell hole with the result the off wheel of the gun left the track and sank nearly axle deep in the mud. The night was pitch dark & Jerry was lobbing over shrapnel just to liven us up a bit & to put the tin hat on the job it commenced to rain. In spite of all the efforts of the men & horses we could not shift the gun. We were just getting the jacks ready to lift the wheel when a driver rode up & said the other gun was stuck near the canal & all the men were required to assist in getting it out. It was now about 1 am in the morning & we were pretty wet already. Back we trudged along the plank road for a distance of about a couple of miles, finding the other party busy with the gun which like our own lay with one wheel off the track. It was an hour's hard work to get it up & once more the team was hitched in & we went forward. Everything went well & we passed our gun, turned the corner safely round the crossroads. A few dozen yards further there was another turn & this time the drivers again bungled it, so that the gun was bogged once more, this time worse than ever.

How to make cakes that are as delicious to eat as they are beautiful to behold. Karen Krasne, the “Queen of Cakes” according to Gourmet magazine, brings a fresh and contemporary sensibility to special-occasion cakes. Instead of the conventional fondant and gum paste, she relies on natural frostings based on chocolate, cream, or butter (which are also easier to make). What makes these cakes showstoppers is their unexpected flavor combinations-take, for example, the Blood Orange Ricotta Torte, the Chocolate Tiramisu, or the Yuzu Tea Cake. These desserts take full advantage of layering-contrasting textures in each bite-as seen in the New York, New York (chocolate ganache, devil’s food cake, chocolate chantilly, and caramelized apples) or the Beau Soleil (mascarpone mousse, peaches, pralines, and honey-soaked pound cake). Krasne favors vibrant touches like fresh fruit and real flowers, which add flair without being fussy. The recipes include tips from her twenty years as a pastry chef, and a step-by-step introduction covers basic techniques. Extraordinary Cakes shows how to create amazing cakes that satisfy sophisticated palates-but are still achievable for the home baker.

Britt is a great deal more straightforward. A former burglar turned straight under Hank's influence (and that of his girlfriend Katie (Laura Allen), whose own attitude towards Britt's criminal past is sometimes disturbingly ambivalent), Britt starts the season as Hank's sidekick and spends it coming into his own, developing his PI skills and his understanding of Hank's limitations and fatal flaws. Despite his criminal past, Britt is sweet, lovable, and always ready with a joke, and Raymond-James could have coasted on these qualities. Instead he imbues Britt with intelligence and a bit of a dark side. He doesn't downplay Britt's lack of maturity, his recognition that he's done terrible things, or his capacity to do them in the future. Still, Britt is most interesting when he's playing opposite other characters. He and Katie are deeply in love, but the relationship has reached the point where it needs to either get a lot more serious or collapse under its own weight, and one of the season's central questions is which way it will fall. There's a lot standing in Britt and Katie's path--he's not quite ready for serious commitment, and she may not be able (or willing) to act as the calm moral center of his tumultuous life--but also a lot to be gained, and the uncertainty of their fate quickly becomes as nail-bitingly tense as the season's central mystery and Hank's journey towards both salvation and damnation. Britt's partnership with Hank, meanwhile, is the one entirely positive force in his life, and for Hank it is the one relationship where he is doing good rather than damage (for now). It's the crux of the characters' lives and of the show. With typical thoughtfulness (and demonstrating the sort of subtlety that probably got them canceled) Terriers's writers avoid the most common trope of partnership-based shows. Britt and Hank are not the most important people in each other's lives. There are people that they love more than each other and relationships that matter more to them than their partnership (I do not, for example, think that they make a particularly slashable couple, though I'm sure there are those who disagree). But that partnership is what makes all those other relationships possible, and when they falter--when Hank burns his last bridge with his ex-wife, or when Britt and Katie flame out--it's there to support them.

Overall the colors in this collection were more interesting to me than Minnie Mouse, though I'm guessing it's the opposite for the general nail polish buying public. It wasn't so very long ago that I thought green nail polish was a seriously odd choice, so I get that. If I were given the opportunity to tweak this collection, I'd get rid of Your Web or Mine and replace it with something dark, like a black or navy creme with silver and blue glitter to represent the night sky that Spider-Man swings through. I'd also make Call Me Gwen-ever a red creme, because his suit is not orange and blue, it's red and blue. It seems srange to me that OPI didn't put a red in here; maybe they figured they've already done every red possible. Or maybe the orange will make more sense to me after I've seen the movie.
I have helped myself to be a better person emotionally.

O’Hare embodies, in one classic comic character, both a police state and the lack of a boundary between business and government that makes such a thing possible, and does so with buffoonery, slapstick and other low-comedy devices that paint the story’s highest authority figure as so obviously wrong that a child couldn’t miss it.

She's twitchy, as well she might be given how out of step her perceptions are with almost everyone else around us. The Central Committee are now in control of the country, she confides, and they're organising house-to-house visits to explain the situation. She tells me that the problems have been going on for a year but the Central Committee's hand has now been forced. The alternative is bloodshed. The Committee are currently meeting to decide on what action to take.
At least that is one thing I can tick on my wish list as done. Even though, the turquoise is a classic that everyone has, and that usually I go for not so common stuff, I must admit that I am thrilled by my acquisition. Just like I was when I finally managed to buy the Falabella bag! It feels like an accomplishment to be able to buy such wonderful pieces on my own.

Mortlock has gone through countless numbers of rewrites (I have genuinely forgotten how many). It was a sprawling book at first and through time it has become more and more streamlined. I shed a lot of favourite scenes and characters. Lots of darlings died in the rewrites but that’s what has to be done!

First up, Wintersnood by De Verhuisbrowerij. Fact fans will be pleased by the three columns of dense text on the label giving not merely prosaic stuff like hop varieties and IBUs, but also batch size and fermentation temperatures. Beer fans will be less pleased by the humongous amount of foam it produces on even the gentlest of pours.

When you see Tulum, it is not hard to understand why someone would want to live there, with its absolutely stunning views of the ocean. Of course, the Mayans weren’t necessarily in the market for a summer home. More likely, they chose Tulum for the water access, as the city was an important trade port. Still, I’m pretty sure they didn’t mind the view…
Many City Councillors see Toronto's public libraries as a financial burden rather than an important community service.

As someone who is retired and has little to lose in the way of personal responsibility to an employer as such, and who can, if necessary, fight with my body (thrown in front of a grader, say, or march on a line) as well as my mind. I think that I speak for many ‘grey panthers’ when I say that the voting base that Harpo considers that he owns will surprise him with their pushback. His economic arguments , just like the right-wing whackjobs south of the 49th, hold absolutely no water…and we want to keep our water, both salt and fresh, as clean as possible…

Most of the plastic stuff we use contains Bisphenol-A (BPA) unless it states otherwise. This means that the cup may leach BPA into whatever is in the cup. If you kid bites the cup, which a lot do, then they are ingesting this as well. BPA is an endocrine disruptor and there is great concern for children as their bodies are at an early development stage and have immature systems for detoxifying chemicals.
So doing the research for WIXI Robot has involved me in an exciting few weeks of catching up - reading everything I can about all that's happened in the 'field' since I slid through the gap in the fence. I'm particularly interested in the progress that robots have made in learning to speak with humans - some, but, as the guy on telly used to say, not a lot. Language understanding is, for a myriad fascinating reasons, one of the hardest tasks in AI.
I started out with my new favorite song, the Rockafeller Skank. Yeah, that's right. ZZUB's got some Fatboy Slim on his iPhone. The ZZUB's so brotha. I freakin' love that song! In fact, it's my new ringtone. If that song don't make you want to get up and sweat, well nothing will. A few songs into my playlist is Triumph's Magic Power. "I'm young now, I'm wild now, I'm born to be free." You know the song. And if you don't then you were born in the wrong decade.

For me, this past year has been an expedition of sorts in personal development and an adoption of a more “simplistic” way of life. By no means does this mean it’s “simple” to achieve, however, the minimization of consumption along with the pursuit of material things gets easier and easier the more I delve into a conscious and

It’s not an exhaustive list by any manner of means but it is indicative of some of the big issues. It can be expanded as we go – or, indeed, challenged. It serves, I think, to indicate that Scotland thinks and feels differently about big issues in society, that we pull towards a different path, that we would be more comfortable, more stable, feel more in solidarity if we went our own way.

He wants to know if it is Mr. Thabo Mbeki’s grand land reform plan to turn productive farmland into squatters’ camps? Farmers’ properties bordering this new handover project have put their farms on the market because of – as usual – crop and stock theft. One of the unoccupied farms bordering this new squatter camp has had its house simply taken away, and farmland in the area has drastically decreased in value as the result of these new land owners. Mr. van Vreden’s complaints are no different to the thousands of others throughout South Africa. But what made his file so shocking were the newspaper clippings he sent us about the treatment of animals by the new owners.

Poor Cassel Sharpe. His mother and both his brothers are cruse workers. His mother can manipulate emotions, his brother Philip is able to inflict serious physical damage with the lightest touch and his other brother, Barron, can alter memories. Cassel’s grandfather was a death worker. You get the idea. Cassel is like the runt of the litter. The only non-worker in his family.

I'd never flown alone so I was really nervous for that. The people who booked my flight assumed that Idaho Falls was close to Boise so they scheduled my flight through that airport. And naturally they scheduled the flight for 6 am. I made the drive to Boise the night before and stayed in a Best Western suite, right next to the airport. The room was nice and big but lonely. I loved sleeping in a king size bed by myself and right in the middle. I'd always wanted to do that. However, I didn't get much sleep because I was worried I'd miss my flight.

That said, I thought the film was funnier and more enjoyable than did the reviewers (WaPo, NYT, even Variety). As usual, the trailer provides a better plot summary. It has gotten only narrow indie-style distribution, but on a per-screen basis, it’s doing better than Eddie Murphy.
In a busy restaurant, there could be many bottles of wine that the staff is dealing with. Consequently, it’s a good idea to identify your wine by writing your initials discretely on the neck label.

Oh and I almost forgot- I just finished uploading my shop! I'm moving out sometime at the end of this year or the beginning of next, and I really need to clear out half of my wardrobe! I looked at my clothes to see if there was anything I hadn't worn in a long time or got very little wears over the past few seasons. Most items are in great condition with no visible flaws or defects, as I haven't worn them out much. If anyone's interested, please check it out here :)

After spending the offseason working on his hitting approach (Jackson got rid of his leg kick and shortened his stride to the ball), the center fielder came through with an impressive start to the season.

Unlike Chani, Flick was born on a weasel farm in upstate NY, and as a domestic type, he is about twice/three times larger than Chani was, but I don't mind his largeness...that means theres just more to snuggle on! He is never still~ either sleeping or getting into absolutely EVERYTHING! He hasn't found his voice yet~ doesn't talk like my Chani did~ she would make the cutest little 'eh eh eh' sounds when she was playing or happy~ nothing like the 'bark' they describe them making these days..... perhaps one day he will remember how to talk.

Yarrow’s hardy rhizome, or underground stem, develops from underground runners as the extensive root system spreads.

I'm having a lot of fun with the names; we're making an effort to sample French wines right now and we've concluded we don't like Burgundy-style wines, so all the Burgundy styles and grapes get to be the bad guys.

So, I’ve been struggling with diet since I started birth control (which I’m actually going to stop using soon), and I decided that it’s not okay that I’m always hungry. So I went on a little research trip through the internet about fitness nutrition. I came to the conclusion that I’m not eating enough, which is causing my little binging series. Well, my three main meals are actually usually on point in terms of content and proportions, however where I’m failing is in my snacks. I’m not eating enough calories to keep my metabolism high or to keep my hunger at bay during my 5+ hour meal breaks.

What we are seeing on our streets is imported, it is a direct result of the uncontrolled immigration which successive governments have encouraged with criminal indifference to the well being of the native population they were elected to protect and serve.We are faced with a situation which was imposed upon us without democratic vote or accountability, it is a situation which is getting worse by the day and with which, we, our children and grandchildren will be dealing with for many years to come, however, we will not be able to deal with it until we call it by its real name.

"The lows of March 2009 marked the beginning of an unexpected recovery—not the beginning of an era of irreversible stagnation. The U.S. economy went from shrinking at a 6.7 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2009 to expanding at a 3.8 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of that year—a turnaround unprecedented in modern history. The stock market has doubled since March 2009, while corporate profits and exports have surged to records. The U.S. economy has regained its 2007 peak, and is now growing at a 3 percent annual clip—a more rapid pace than any other developed economy. The crucible of the recession forged an economic structure that is more resistant to shocks than the brittle vessel that shattered in 2008. Meanwhile, Europe continues to grapple with insoluble banking and sovereign debt crises, and developing-economy juggernauts like China and Brazil are showing signs of cracking.

One’d have thought that the market for cycling and accessories (clothing being a key component) would be limited. Not so. Mintel (as quoted in The Independent on November 4th) have stated it is worth 700 million (yes… million) squiddlys in the UK alone. And, in 2011 it’ll be even higher.
Funny thing is, I bet I’m not alone. I bet I’m in the same boat as a lot of other people like me, those who have been coached to the gills to pass interviews. Interviews used to be a two way street. The candidate would ask about the company and decide if they were interested in the position. The company would ask the candidate questions to see if they were right for the position. Through time, they morphed into nothing more than a lying contest. Instead of asking them about their company, we impress them with the information we obtained googling the company on our I-Phone ten minutes before the interview.

The plight of sharks and shark finning is garnering more attention now than ever before. So why is it still an issue? With bans in California, proposals by the EU and large hotel chains such as the Shangri La deciding to take shark fins off the menu you would expect the issue to be gaining momentum. What’s stopping this from instantly becoming a worldwide effort?
In his post he mentions a wee girl with a lazy eye. Now, when we are kids, and more likely than not into adulthood, we always have something that we don't like about ourselves. Something we feel hinders us in the popularity stakes. I remember a ginger haired lass at my primary school that had cheeks that were just so white and round that I used to have daydreams about stabbing them, I don't know why. Admittedly, she pissed me off no end, she was one of those "I'm so much better than you" types.

“I applaud the Mayor for selecting these two prestigious institutions renowned in the field of science, engineering, technology and research,” said Council Member James. “This academic initiative will increase New York City’s capacity for the applied sciences, and boost the City’s economy.

The last big thing that really stuck out in this episode is the thick hatred that Tim Riggins and Smash Williams have for each other. It’s not even a hidden kind of hatred. It’s flat-out blatant and in front of everyone. I’m not sure if the two of them are supposed to have a past of some sort, or if they just rub each other the wrong way, but something must be planned moving forward because their mutual dislike has been pretty apparent so far two episodes in to the season.

On Brook Street, the 14th century Marlborough Head Inn, and a continuing frontage of stately brick and rendered Georgian houses. Opposite, to the south of the square, is Well House, home of the former Grammar School which received its Charter from Queen Elizabeth in 1575. Founded four years earlier, the school’s first Governors included Edmund Sherman and his brother and father, both named Henry. The building’s present form, now Grade I listed, dates from 1732 when it was rebuilt by Nicholas Freeman, who must have found himself a very busy man as the alterations were carried out simultaneously with those at Shermans.

Minutes before the crucial quarter-final match between Spurs and Bolton, I prepared some food to eat so I can enjoy the game. It started off horribly unlucky for us which has seen Bolton take the lead with just 6 minutes into the game, thanks to another hapless marking in set-pieces. Thankfully, after Bale’s own goal, he made amends 5 minutes later with a delightful cross that Walker guided at the back of the net with his head – 1 apiece.

The book is also designed for teachers of writing, and I do a lot of that. I’ve read a lot of books on how to write screenplays, novels, plays and poetry. Some of them were excellent, some of them were prescriptive and taught writing by numbers – particularly the ones on writing screenplays. I’ve taken quite a few writing workshops and courses, ones with David Lane in Bristol and the Soho Theatre’s Sarah Dickenson have been great. I’ve spent some years understanding the ‘rules’, finding ways of teaching them clearly, producing my own handouts, explanations, tips, examples…now I’m looking for a book that says the opposite.

I realize many parts of the country have been experiencing above average temperatures and unseasonably beautiful weather for weeks, we here in the Pacific Northwest have not.

6. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, politician and 2nd wife of Nelson Mandela (1936 - )
Councillor Burton was re-elected to serve the Harrowgate Hill ward on Darlington Borough Council for a second four-year term on May 5.
Other elements are done for the dumbest of reasons. The doctor’s sister is a fifty year old lesbian for the sole purpose of having her and her girlfriend make love on a bed Holland is trapped beneath. A film like this needs comic relief, but not marx Brothers level absurdity in that vein.
Gung Fu is my obsession. I have numerous books on Wing Chun and a few on Tai Chi. I would read then re-read and annotate the margins and gaps, highlighting the important aspects. And from time-to-time, I’d make my own unique observations. But at some point, the study has to make sense. It has to be assimilated and the student has to ‘make it his own’. I now realize that all I managed to do by reading such books, was to take away from the process of self-discovery by failing to focus on the most important requirement; practice.

So it is Monday, April 16th at a quarter until six. I woke up today feeling like a champion after drinking myself to sleep last night! Wishful thinking aside, I did some homework (awesome I know) and then fell asleep. I read a fair amount of online articles. Some had me thinking, one in particular really. It was about work life balance,and what is the meaning of true work life balance. I can attest to it because I have somehow managed to make a routine cycle a part of my life, and low and behold I have some sort of work life balance. I figured being a 22-year-old student with a full-time job, I had to incorporate some sort of personal time. So I have weekends off and afternoons after five o’ clock. So in reality I have a normal work schedule. My work life balance is pretty sharp, on the weekends I don’t even think about work. Then comes MONDAY, feeling sharp and crisp for the week ahead. It repeats, it feels like the weeks are going by faster or maybe just a little slower. There are times where I let work bleed into my social life, i.e. twitter,Facebook, etc.. There are some people who don’t even have their works listed on their social sites,and that is totally understandable. I am just too proud to not display where I work, then again I’m a big nerd and love my job. I may say that now, but who knows what I will be saying five to ten years from now. But lets all be positive, because the day is almost over, and mostly everyone is out of work (woohoo!) So overall this Monday was pretty awesome, but not as awesome as watching the Tupac hologram video. The hologram has been done before, but I had to blog about it, because its Monday, and today was excellent. To move forward with the tirades, I am still deciding what direction this blog will take, or determine what it will be about even though I wrote a lengthy post which you can read here. The decision will be a tough choice,but I’ll eventually reach a compromise. I may end up just splitting up the blog and have a personal blog, and a blog dealing directly with video games and news associated with it. I was going to post a video to introduce the Mondays but I got lazy, its Monday, see where this is going? (I made the video, whoopi!) Another exciting article I read today was about the guy who auditioned for the Denver Broncos cheerleading squad. He has heart, he has spirit, I tip my hat off to the guy, he is setting the classic example of follow your heart, and follow your dreams. A concept I believe everyone should follow. To me this blog could fall under that category. I always had this idea on the far end of the back burner, finally I got tired of saying I will, and I finally did, and it feels great. Words can’t express how it feels to do something you love, or to follow your dream. So to end this introductory post about MONDAYS (you need to scream it to feel it), I will end by saying that its been great, I hope everyone has had a good one today, if you did don’t be afraid to say it, leave a comment!

* Purgatory: any situation causing suffering. A miserable situation.
But, there comes a time – at least one – in the drafting of every new novel, when the energy flags, despite my best efforts before writing. I’m an outliner. I have never hidden that fact. I like following a plan and still letting the creativity flow. But sometimes I reach a scene that I’m just not feeling. I procrastinate, and hem and haw, and eventually eke out a sentence at a time until I refind my mojo.
