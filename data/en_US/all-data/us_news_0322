The melting pot, as it's limned in "Crash," is seasoned with strychnine and epithets. There's not a single encounter, even of the most benign sort, that doesn't come down to ethnicity, that isn't grounded in stereotypes.

I didn't count the Tom Clancy/Jack Ryan flicks because three different actors starred in the four movies (and the fourth, with Ben Affleck, was awful). The films needed to at least have the same main star, even if it that star was a doll and a voice.

If at first you don't succeed ...To sell questionable projects to voters, a good cause is usually boasted as beneficiary. In 1980, the Colorado Lottery was promoted in order to to benefit parks and open space. Voters approved. For a decade, though, the legislature appropriated the proceeds, building prisons and some educational projects. In 1992, a knowledgable uprising went back to the voters to create the Great Outdoors Colorado Trust Fund, known as GOCO, to use a portion of the lottery proceeds as was originally promised. Voters overwhelmingly approved the program. Since 1993, GOCO grants totaling $714 million have been awarded to 3,500 projects, helping create 1,172 community parks, build or restore 720 miles of trail, and protect wildlife and more than 837,000 acres of open space. The legislature persists in trying to get its hands on the money — even though GOCO is an independent trust, not a state agency, a legacy of the citizens of Colorado.

All the resources will go — are dedicated toward increasing public safety for children near schools and parks. And I want to do something else.

Dutch composer Johan Wagenaar (1862-1941) isn't well known today, but on the evidence of his lively, thoroughly Romantic Overture to "Cyrano de Bergerac," he deserves a wider hearing.

This was just the latest setback for the venerable base, which has experienced problems ranging from lawsuits to buried, unexploded bombs to becoming overrun with excessive quantities of geese and deer. In writing the fort off its books, the owners cite legal entanglements, a poor economy and the fact that "we just realized that this place is really in the middle of freaking nowhere."

In a blatant attempt to curry favor with the right wing, Gov. Romney has been willing to make far too many divisive statements. I expected better of him. I suspect not only that he knows how hypocritical he sounds, but that he has come to the conclusion that, in order to beat Gingrich and Santorum, he needs to throw red meat to the radical right wing of his party.

"It's not something that's talked about but they do take a lot of pride in it," 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh said. "I think the way our guys, our coaches, our team approach it, is how it plays in to situational football, how it helps us to accomplish the one and only thing we want to accomplish and that's be a winning defense. Win the next game. It's a big factor being able to contain an opponent's running game, to shut down an opponent's running game. To keep them out of the end zone."

Mr. Samuelsson displays 200 recipes with gastro-porno photos—barbecued snapper from West Africa, curried trout with coconut chili sauce from Kenya, apple squash fritters from South Africa, monstrous red papayas, glistening mango couscous. He goes to the ancient markets of Dakar and Addis Ababa, to the beaches of Zanzibar. We learn the origins of Cape Malay cuisine, visit Nelson Mandela's favorite restaurant in Soweto.

As with the teen pregnancy rates we discussed yesterday, child obesity rates have shifted dramatically over the last two decades -- but this trend line has been moving in the wrong direction. Given the risks of Type II diabetes, it's a problem that about 19% of 6- to 11-year-olds are obese.

As The Times prepares to go to print Friday with its editorial recommending which way to vote on the proposition (and it could be a mistake to infer anything about that editorial's conclusions based on anything written here), the latest figures on campaign expenditure have come out. The two biggest contributors to campaign for 29, according to MapLight's voter guide, are the American Cancer Society and the foundation started by bicyclist Lance Armstrong, a cancer survivor, with the two giving about $1.5 million each. Overall, the pro-campaign has raised $4.5 million.

Marjorie Cicala from Middle River was looking for baked Sesame Chicken recipe that was demonstrated by a poultry distribution company at the Maryland State Fair in the 1960s and that she and her brothers and sister all loved. She said that the recipe for the delicious baked chicken with sesame seeds that her mother had written down was stolen from her purse at a school event some time ago. While no readers responded to Cicala's original query, I thought this was worth a little investigating. I searched several of the larger poultry company websites and did not find any recipes for baked sesame chicken; however, I did like the sound of a recipe on http://www.Tastebook.com, a large recipe sharing database, for a Sesame-Yogurt Baked Chicken. I decided to give it a try and was very pleased that I did. The recipe called for a whole frying chicken cut into quarters but I tested it using boneless/skinless chicken breasts instead. The result was a moist and delicious chicken dish that was a snap to prepare and was ready in under an hour. I served it with jasmine rice and broccoli and everyone in my house cleaned their plates. I recommend that Cicala give this recipe a try. While it may not be exactly the chicken dish she remembers, I feel confident that her family will enjoy it as much as mine did.

I kept hoping to see one over the next few days, as I toured a replica of the third sultan Mansur Shah's palace, built in 1986 of ironwood from Sarawak using dove-tailed joints instead of nails; the roofless ruins of St. Paul's Church, originally a Portuguese chapel dating from 1521; and, of course, A'Famosa, framed by tall palm trees and old canons.

Before the presentations began, the speakers were treated to a lunch cooked and served by the 23 students of the high school's nutrition class. (The class is under the chef's cap of humanities teacher Laurie Hughes and many of the fresh ingredients came directly from the school's award-winning — Oceana High School Garden.) On the menu was a choice of carrot and orange soup, curried cauliflower soup or Algerian tomato soup, homemade biscuits and a salad decision of Tunisian carrot, kale or green — every item, fabulous. Desserts of pumpkin cupcakes or black mocha cupcakes with whip cream equally hit the 'wow' on the beyond-delicious barometer.

But it doesn’t come close to ending a longtime standoff over how to implement court-ordered mandates so towns, builders and advocates for low-and-moderate income families are satisfied. Lawmakers still plan to legislate new guidelines, and the state Supreme Court is expected to hear a case challenging COAH regulations. Either could significantly affect the new housing policy.
The Grey, whose clipped title, grim swagger, and lost-in-the-outback themes conjure up visions of that Alec Baldwin/Anthony Hopkins classic, The Edge, devolves into a predictable man-against-nature, and man-against-fellow man, affair. There are witty nods to other such films (Werner Herzog's Grizzly Man, Ethan Hawke's Andes plane crash-cannibal tale, Alive), but the wit stops there. The stunts become more preposterous, the computer-rendered snowy chasms more impossibly fake, the haunted look in Neeson's eye more tragic and soul-torn.
Hollywood cast Obama in a leading role the minute they saw him (it was Norman Lear who introduced him to the entertainment industry bigwigs at his hilltop Los Angeles house nearly five years ago). Since then he's collected celebrity fans like paparazzi.

"These are things that really leave a very good legacy for the city ... There have been expenses, of course. You don't build an airport for free," Rogge told The Associated Press in Lausanne, Switzerland. "Had Athens still been outmoded, the economy would have been much worse probably than it is today."
Madden very wisely lets the “riot of noise and color” and spectacular sunsets of India freely cast their spell on you, and they do. Douglas especially succumbs, while wife Jean fiercely resists. Sonny, we learn, disobeys his attractive, imperious mother (Lillete Dubey) by pursuing the incredibly gorgeous -Sunaina (former model Tena Desae), a telephone operator at a company run by her protective brother (Bhuvnesh Shetty). Evelyn starts a blog, while Madge invades the posh Viceroy Club on a hunt for a new suitor, and Graham goes out in search of a male lover he had in India 40 years earlier.

She is the mother of a baby boy — a boy whose middle name is Joseph, in honor of his grandfather. Michele Heidenberger's young son, after some difficult teen years, is a college graduate and working on Wall Street, a best friend to his very proud father. And what of the sister with the most sorrowful eyes? She is married and thriving in New York City. Last year, on the eve of Sept. 11, she gave birth to a baby boy. The boy was born within 30 minutes of her own birthday, the same day of the year when she had last celebrated with her mother in 2001. As she told her father, "This has Mom written all over it."

Aulani is a different kind of development for Disney, the first that isn't linked to a theme park or its cruise line. The hotel will be far from the famous tourist areas and beaches of Waikiki, which is on the other side of Honolulu, to the east, near Diamond Head. Ko Olina is the kind of self-contained environment Disney likes for many of its developments.
Back in 1971 when the Magic Kingdom opened, it was called Tropical Serenade and featured animatronic birds and flowers doing their thing for more than 25 years before transforming into The Enchanted Tiki Room -- Under New Management with the voice talents of Iago from Alladin and Zazu from The Lion King in 1999.

Noteworthy: I'm told the restaurant staffers enjoy a significantly spicier salsa when they eat at Ernesto's on break. The regular mild salsa is what is served to customers. But if you want hot and spicy instead of tepid, you should request it at the outset. Same goes for your main course  if you want it hot, the kitchen will take care of you.
The bank's international transaction services had quarterly revenue of $2.7 billion, up 7%. The international reach came in especially handy at a time when rival banks in Europe have stepped back from such transactions.

Spirit (www.spiritair.com), a low-cost carrier, offered one-click access to bag fees from its home page and two-click access to a "Travel Policies" page, a mix of fees and rules that required more clicking, which sometimes led to vague statements.

Like the original, “Sleazy Remix 2.0 Get Sleazier,” out today, features the electro pop star, now 24, working the song in her sing/rap style. In a bit of irony, the tune finds a girl who spells her name with a dollar sign brushing off wealthy men, letting them know how unimpressed she is with the size of their bank accounts. A sassy Ke$ha coos: “I don’t need you or your brand new Benz.”

"There are two things that people will come up and talk to me about when I'm traveling through other parts of the state," FitzGerald said Friday. "One is this trial. The other is the way that we've been doing things differently here. Believe me, we have gotten serious attention from other parts of the state for how we're coming back from this."
Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson star as residents -- inmates, actually -- of a stylish, high-tech holding tank in the wake of some ecological disaster. Of the hundreds who live in the place, which looks like an outsize Ian Shrager hotel, right down to the zonked help, only a few will be chosen to go to The Island, supposedly the last uncontaminated spot on earth. But this relatively comfy dystopia is not what it seems, as the rebellious hero and the mostly pliant heroine discover when they escape to the outside world.

James didn't flinch.
It's tough enough to raise girls in a culture that too often views them as objects. Every time we let a comment like that slip by, we demean what it means to be a woman. Sure, it was a joke. And, no, my nine-year-old was not up at that time watching Letterman. But making a remark like that trivialized and sexualized a little girl who has no responsibility for what her older sister did and should have a right to not be lampooned as an object of amusement. Every time it's mentioned on the news, little girls watching think, "I guess it's okay to make lewd jokes about women being used."
Coast Guard and National Guard helicopters and water craft rescued three crew members who were clinging to rocks, Read said. The body of the other crew member was pulled from the water.
Play your way. "Let your child know that other people get a say," Newman says.
