Buddy Beat member Tom Chalmers was heavily involved in the film making process. “I have never done anything like that before. There was a tremendous amount to take in, I was interviewer, interviewee, narrator, location manager, producer, wardrobe- you name it I did it! When I first heard about the awards I was told we had made the final six which stunned me, but then when we got that magic call to say that we had won The Scottish Epic Award I just couldn’t believe it and I was on such a high. My head was somewhere between Saturn and Mars, and I don’t think I have come back down to orbit yet. When I see the film I am immensely proud of it, and it was the willingness of my fellow drummers to take part that makes it so special. Like the rest of our great group, I am totally thrilled at this honour.”

She can not wait until this evening to go trick-or-treating! She has a Cinderella costume that she has looked at about a 1000 times and this morning when she woke up, her first words were, "Mommy, Halloween!". I'll post a pic of her in her costume tonight.

On Wednesday I decided to take a drive to Left Coast Cellars. One reason was to get the magnum filled, the other was to go to what I call, my happy place. There is something about Left Coast that makes me feel as though I have received a warm hug. The staff are great and from our very first visit to visits since, they have made us feel as though we were home. Left Coast is the first winery we take guests to and when they leave they feel the same way.

I love the way she talks, the way she cooks, the way she has a hug and a kiss for everyone she meets....she is the epitome of a Southern Gal!
That being said, graduate studies aren’t mandatory when it comes to finding a job in the industry, but it helps, says Hugh Lui, associate director and graduate co-ordinator at the University of Toronto Institute of Aerospace Studies. “For the undergraduate students to get a job it’s quite competitive. A postgraduate degree will help a lot in terms of getting into the industry and starting their career development,” he says.

My mom was also an incredible asset to my understanding of agribusiness. As the director of commercial/agribusiness at a national insurance company, she taught me the importance of networking, strong writing and public speaking skills, and being well-read on agriculture topics. All of these experiences played into my passion for the agriculture industry.

So why the oysters? Well, the two of us recently have become passengers on the “I love oysters” train, and I thought it would be a grand idea (just as “Let’s go see ‘Our American Cousin‘” was thought to be a grand idea once). The oysters were just OK, though (but no open wounds). I decimated many of the shells, but seemed to get the hang of it by the end. The lamb stew turned out to be pretty good, I thought, but the focus was certainly on the wines so no one gave a crap. Here are the wines (in order of consumption):
Someone who wants to exterminate the Jews, won't let any Jew "redeem" himself by participating in pro-white activities, or believes the Nazi genocide of Jews never happened, has disqualified himself from any serious, or even sane, discussion. I'm not interested in "the best" someone has to offer, when he's so obviously fucked in the head.Responding to another comment from someone who pointed out that he had claimed he wasn't a "racist" at Svigor's, Unamused writes:Don't make a fool of yourself by forgetting that just because liberals misuse the term, that doesn't mean actual racism doesn't exist. Have you not noticed my many posts addressing anti-white racism? Now, I am not a racist, as will be made clear in my next post. But attacking or excluding Jews because they are Jews is racism.This is all very Austeresque. The ambiguous jewish identity. The hostility to anyone put off by that ambiguity. The inability to accept Whites as distinct from jews even while taking for granted that jews are distinct from Whites. The self-righteous "white" advocacy. Hinging that advocacy on unfettered criticism of blacks while condemning Whites for criticizing jews. The histrionics. The hypocrisy. The projection. The rationalizations. The talmudic hairsplitting. The acceptance of jews and subordination of non-jewish interests as a moral litmus test. The irrational hatred of Kevin MacDonald. The dishonest "liberal" rhetoric. The control-freak need to edit and censor other people's comments. I could go on.

All of those years of hearing sermon after sermon, youth camp after Bible study, about doing BIG things for a BIG God with BIG visions and BIG plans left us with crazy-high expectations on ourselves coupled with a narrow understanding of following Jesus. And then, when, like most of the kids in the youth groups or Bible colleges, we found ourselves in a rather usual sort of life, surprisingly not preaching to thousands on a weeknight, we were left feeling like failures, like somehow we weren’t measuring up, we weren’t serving God effectively, we must have missed it because isn’t our life supposed to be about doing big, successful things for God?

Like everyone else, I'm glued to any internet reports I can find about the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan. My friend Di (discoverer of the fairy-on-a-motorcycle pin) lives just north of Tokyo, and her Facebook updates have been calmness itself. Although her family, like everyone else, is being affected daily by power outages and transportation difficulties--not to mention aftershocks--she suffered only minor losses in the earthquake and was well out of range of the tsunami. Nevertheless, "nerve-wracking" is a vast understatement.

I was to find another great shop, however. After we had lunch in the outdoor restaurant at the resplendent Hotel Jerome, we walked across the street to find the little "Old Hippie Antique Shop" in a bright yellow clapboard house with dark green trim. There, I found a gorgeous, tall (and heavy) blue and white Italian vase for a great bargain. Bonny and Dana were gracious enough to carry it back to the van for me!

I’ll be honest, I wasn’t sure I was going to like this book when I first read it. I love John Green’s work and have really enjoyed his books, but this one was taking me into territory that made me a bit uncomfortable. It was taking me into the life and mind of a teenager with terminal cancer. The beauty of this novel is that it does so much more than merely tell a story. It makes you see the world differently. Hazel is so much more than a teenager with cancer. She is a human being with thoughts and feelings. She refuses to be defined by her disease.

This weekend I am thinking about the garden... This past winter was very harsh and many established plants have been lost... severe winds and minus temperatures have done quite a bit of snap freezing... The big picture is still very beautiful... how could it not be in this magnificent corner of Provence... but much of the detail has been lost... The garden beds have been depleted, the hedges burnt severely and some of our fruit trees have died...

It’s one of Mensch’s most regularly deployed rhetorical devices: to position herself as the common-sense centrist, less a Conservative than a normal person in among the political extremists. Whether it always chimes with the public’s sense of her is another question: there’s another view of Mensch, as a self-publicist with less interest in politics than in her own visibility.

When I went to feed them this morning I saw her and she had quite literally just been born. We saw her stand for the first time and take her first shaky steps. It's brilliant! She looks smaller than Herbie did, but when I saw him for the first time he was all dry and fluffy. Stella is still wet. Cocoa was an angel and let me clean a wee bit of amniotic sac off Stella's face and check to see if she was a boy or a girl. Then we stepped back and let them do their thing. She hadn't drunk anything yet as she was barely able to stand up, but we'll watch her closely to make sure she does.
When I was a kid, I never recall waking up before my dad. The only time I saw dad asleep in bed was on one of those rare occasions he was sick, or if I arose in the middle of the night needing to deal with a parent-assisted childhood emergency, such as cracker crumbs in my bed.
Consider Your Platform
I almost skipped this challenge. Not because I didn't think I couldn't do it, but because I was kind of too tired to put forth the mental capacity to actually think about it. But then Shelley started taunting me and calling me "scardy-cat", among other names, so I decided to go ahead and give it a try. I have been craving a good steak lately, so I thought I would try my hand at broiling them for the first time. They turned out ok, but probably would have been better if I hadn't bought the cheapest toughest steaks available at the store. But the flavor was good, and I enjoyed the goat cheese/butter on the top! The cauliflower and parsnips puree, however, is an entirely different story. Oh sweet deliciousness, I could have eaten it all. I almost did, actually, because I went back for seconds, and it was too amazing to throw it away, so I ate as much as I could possibly handle. We also served these awesome honey cornmeal muffins as well, but I forgot to take pictures of them.

As the movie of memories continued she cursed at him and ran off. Her voice was louder than it should have been but she wasn’t thinking. When she left she hoped he would follow but that wasn’t the case, he never would have done that.

For the longest time, I just could not comprehend what my husband was doing with that Desperate Idiotic Woman during the early days after our reconciliation which lasted months after. It may have looked like it was his way of Letting Go, but it sure as hell felt like being stabbed in the back over and over again. If you think your husband have stopped any kind of communication or contact with the deplorable Other Woman after D-Day, think again. In my case, that did not happen overnight.

Chris graduated from the Citadel military college and entered the Army as a 2nd Lieutenant. He was promoted quickly up through the ranks over the years that followed. Then in February 2007, while serving in Iraq, a roadside bomb exploded near the personnel carrier he was in. Four other men died in the attack. Chris was seriously injured, but the medics on the scene saved his life and got him airlifted out of there. He was in a medically induced coma for over six weeks while some of his internal injuries healed, and we wouldn't know the extent of any brain damage until he was finally brought out of the coma.

While many orchids have shapes similar to beak shapes, few seem to be as specific to an animal beyond shape. So why bumble bees? Why is competition to win them over advantageous? One word: hair. Unlike beetles, flies, and even other types of bees, bumble bees are fuzzy by all insect standards. That means it can carry more pollen on its hairs and the pollen stays on these bees better than almost any other animal that might visit an orchid.

I've been promising my Grandfather all week that I'd help him with some gardening, for some bizarre reason he ordered 500 plants this year, (God knows why! It already makes Kew Gardens look like an allotment) they were delivered last week and he's been in a fever of worry about getting them planted. Unfortunately the whole garden, which is a decent size, needed to be weeded and have the soil turned, blah, blah, etc, etc before any new plants could be put in.

“The light within,” I think, means affection, affection as motive and guide. Knowledge without affection leads us astray every time. Affection leads, by way of good work, to authentic hope. The factual knowledge, in which we seem more and more to be placing our trust, leads only to hope of the discovery, endlessly deferrable, of an ultimate fact or smallest particle that at last will explain everything.

Once again on the run, they fall in with a violent outlaw named Corisco who wages war against the landowning class. Their violent escapades are soon ended by a bounty hunter named Antonio Das Mortes, hired by the local Church and landowners. The feature leads to a tense standoff that in many ways resembles Italian spaghetti Westerns. But the tone is completely different. These aren’t weary, hardened outlaws…merely misguided peasants seeking a leader and a purpose.

I must emphasize that these almonds are not a sweet, glazed type of snack. They are plain and simple, roasted almonds dusted with cinnamon.

I thought the desert was going to be boring but worth the experience of long straight roads through flat nothingness. But it's so varied. We started off through scrub and small trees for about the first 50km then we past our first dried white lake beds and suddenly the small trees stopped and the horizon opened up. Scrub continued in its gorgeous blue green colour, so did the dead kangaroos (one being chewed by a fox) and the dead cows. We saw quite a few of these, their carcasses collapsing from the inside and their hides drying in the beating heat of the sun. Imagine hitting a cow! No thank you!
Birth rarely meets our plan and often exceeds our expectations and for some mothers the fear of unexpected homebirth isn’t far from the surface. This is my third opportunity to share in this blessing and with each the mother has later reflected on the rightness and simplicity that was offered to her thru this humbling experience. Without the fuss and drama, the interruptions and interventions, a mother carves her path led by her natural rhythms and strengths alone. She births in beauty and grace and she does so wild and free.
Ultimately, I just want to say that although A Cup of Subtle Tea is going through an identity crisis right now I can’t wait to see where it goes and what comes next.

Makino doesn’t give him ultimatums and she doesn’t moon over him when he’s being an asshole. He figures out for himself, in his slow, idiotic way that there are things she won’t tolerate and more importantly why she won’t tolerate them. She makes him think. Most of all, she is kind to him when he doesn’t remotely deserve it. I really think it’s the fact that she is tough the same way he is, but capable of compassion that hooks him forever. It’s not just that she’s “good” and so he has to learn to be “good enough”.
The Colonel and I escaped for our very first trip away w/o the boy this weekend. We've both been on trips ourselves, but this is the first time we BOTH left him at the same time.

Security guards denied them permission to enter the office and they left after waiting for 45 minutes, leaving the items wrapped in red cloth at the counter of the guards.
Nudity is rarely shot straight on when not in scenes of intimacy. For a voyeuristic – exploitative – approach, the camera merely pulls back, and shows us nudity through reflection instead. It works, and the nudity becomes more tantalizing, as if we the audience where seeing something we weren’t supposed to, sneaking a peak instead of staring at the naked flesh.

A couple of weeks ago, you had hand, foot and mouth. Most of your class had it, and you were out of school for four days. It was one of mommy’s busiest weeks at work, so thankfully, your daddy took two and a half days off and Grammy spent a day and a half with you. It was a very mild case, and you were back to yourself in no time! We pray for your health every day, and I’m so glad that you’ve been really healthy since you were born.

I walked into his big boy room with a big boy in my arms, laid him down, and he immediately jumped back into my arms crying for daddy. I just said "it's ok buddy, just lay down." He laid right back down, I stayed and rubbed his back for a couple of minutes, walked away, and shut the door. Never heard a peep. He went right to sleep.

As the reading guide on Oprah.com states, the story is largely concerned with Maya's experiences as a black mother. She says, "The black mother perceives destruction at every door, ruination at each window, and even she herself is not beyond her own suspicion" (pp. 36-37). As is often the theme in these Oprah-y selections, being a mother is, of course, next to godliness - Maya is suspicious of the white woman Shelley Winters, but decides to trust her because "she was a mother just like me, looking after her child" (p. 91). Of course, being a mother does not mean one is inherently good or trustworthy - I have heard some most despicable cases of child abuse perpetrated by "mothers", for example. Nothing makes one good or bad - not skin colour, not gender, not whether they have given birth - but their actions and thoughts alone.
Sometimes I brat because I want attention. Sometimes it's because I actually want a spanking. Sometimes it's because I know I'm stressed or in a bad mood, and I want that rush of adrenaline that happens when I feel myself in danger of being spanked hard. When you know that someone loves you but will still hurt you in a specific, focused way, well, that brings the best kind of adrenaline rush. And adrenaline rushes tend to take my mind of off the other daily stresses of life.

Now that I have got you mentally trawling your own relations for genius and money (best of luck), I can share with you the discovery of a young, beautiful and talented film-maker emerging from the Hat's genealogical debris. She produces opinionated rule-breaking film, often music based, stuffed with the fresh take of youth and it was while watching one of these the other day, I was reminded of the huge influence of original moving images backed with powerful music and their ability to stimulate, sharpen and often change our view.

I believe that this is the world’s largest threat, since so many people use antibiotics when they catch a cold or get an infection. With bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotics on the rise in population, unless we discover a new way to fight the bacteria, this could become a huge problem.

She shops with my parents each week, makes her own meals, keeps her little flat spotless and is always beautifully turned out - tottering around in heeled shoes when really she ought to be shuffling in flats... but, no! Vanity is the last bastion of independence and she'd sooner stay in the house than wear "ugly" shoes.
Fifty years ago, the area consisted of largely old and new law tenements in an area historically known as “Hell’s Kitchen” which certain real estate interests were trying to rename Clinton, so as to throw off its reputation as one of the worst slums in the City that for almost a century had been ruled by the Irish street gangs and later by mobsters and bootleggers during prohibition. The name Clinton has never really stuck as many of the old line residents (and now many newer residents) have preferred the name Hell’s Kitchen, which evokes the antecedents of the Irish immigrant poor and their struggle to move from poverty and prosperity and the romanticized past of Irish street gangs, bootleggers and gentlemen mobsters loosely affiliated with show girls, prize fighters and actors.
The policemen who bundled Sivakumar away, and their political masters, remind us all of school bullies. Having been soundly defeated, and infuriated, they snatch up the ball, proclaim themselves the winners, and rain their fists on all the other players.
Now, to be fair, I was once one of them. I was seventeen and I wanted to do absofuckinglutely everything there was to do. Twice. I did allll the big stuff: Sacré Coeur, Notre Dame, Louvre, d'Orsay, Grand Palais, l'Opéra and the list goes on. By day three I had trigger finger, was partially blind and had a permanent cramp in my cheeks from smiling for the birdy. I even have a photo with a panhandler and his drugged pets. I thought they were so cute, "sleeping" under his blanket in a baby carriage, and I gave him a few coins for kibble. So naive, was I.
Islam is not one big happy family. It is sharply divided between the Sunnis, the majority, and the Shiites. It will be generations before the Muslims ever manage to live with each other in the Middle East without the prospect of these two groups killing one other with regularity.
Anyway, let’s see: as I posted a few weeks ago, I’m really getting into this tennis thing. Nancy and I have been rallying everyday, but we’ve gone one step further by acquiring a ball machine. They’re pricey, but I can tell you, our games have taken a parabolic step forward. Just the ability to return hundreds of balls coming at 70mph with topspin is a godsend if you want to improve. (“return” is generous. Maybe “attempting to return.”)

(Also, for an after-game drink, I picked up a bottle of brandy at the local liquor store and am now seriously reconsidering my life choices up to this point. Experienced drinkers, does this get better? Or does it always taste like wine mixed with jet fuel? I am conflicted…though, of course, not conflicted enough to dump the rest of my glass.)

This wait gives me time to survey my fellow diners, and unlike Arzak (#8), or Momofuku (#40) or even Marque (#70) there are no suits, no hushed reverential whispers, but rather a plethora of worlds colliding in this tiny dining room.

I’m talking about the people who only talk about church and only talk about the wrong in people and correct peoples’ mistakes. Even Jesus told us to take the plank out of our own eyes before pointing out the speck in another’s eye. There are many people who don’t believe the same thing I do. As much as I would love for them to know the grace and love I know through Christ I am not going to shove it down their throat. People say offensive things all the time but I am not going to attack them. One of my favorite bloggers just posted something that I couldn’t even finish reading because it was so offensive that it hurt but I am not going to comment on it and preach at her. That is not my place. If someone asks me my opinion then I will give it to them in the most respective way I can.

Eric Hobsbawm’s The Age of Capital is the second book in series that survey European and world history during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The Age of Capital examines the years 1848 – 1875 and is a work of synthesis. Having read deeply and widely on economic and world history, Hobsbawm’s study attempts to understand the era in its entirety and incorporates a wide body of literature into a coherent narrative. Because of its nature, this book is based entirely on secondary sources but this does not make the study less valuable. Historians can produce hundreds of monographs concerning a particular era but at some point they must step back and understand the period as a continuous and cognizant whole. Though some issues are glossed over such as the founding of the British Raj, the Italian and German wars of unification, and the Crimean War, Hobsbawm is still able to create an encompassing narrative that successfully depicts the economic and world developments of the period.

So here’s my foray into a new line of thinking. And all I could think tonight when my friend was talking to me was how “with it” she still is for all her forgetfulness and in her, I saw my Granny, I saw my Mom, I saw me. We all just want to be loved and stay in our homes as long as we possibly can.

*knowing I’m never alone
Maybe someday my anger will go away, but right now it is still there. It is my way of protecting, protecting his wonderful parents and friends, who have to go to therapy because of him and who have to pretend that they are okay when they never will be. I feel like someone has to be angry at him, for their sake. I am not trying to make his pain seem illegitimate, because depression is serious. I have felt pain, every person on this earth feels pain. I read about women recently that were raped and live every day with an ache in their heart, and enduring pain that will never go away. Even when we are content, pain stays with us, in the back of our minds, and it can come back anytime. I know his pain was real, I just believe that suicide was not the way and that he could have gotten help. I know his pain is real because I hold it, just like all his friends and family. His pain was given to us and has changed us as well. We may be happy in our lives, but that pain will always be there, and it is because of him. I do think there is a light at the end of the tunnel of this sad post, and that is that I can reflect on this in this blog. I know how I feel and who I am and that makes things a little better. I think we will be okay and that’s the bright side. Pain will not hold power over me if I understand it. And that is my hope for the future.

The most notable element of this story is the introduction of Peri. The idea of Peri was that she would appeal to American viewers by having an American accent (which unfortunately Nicola Bryant was unable to portray in any convincing form) and male viewers everywhere by wearing less than modest outfits. In her first story, Peri is actually quite good and lacks the annoying qualities she later developes. Its easy to dislike Peri, but she can be appreciated if you give her the chance. Characters like hers are actually more interesting than companions who adore the Doctor, like Jo Grant and Sarah Jane Smith.
Well my first image is a lesson on how not to do things, and sometimes you need to make mistakes to learn from them. I had an absolutely beautiful model, with wonderful make-up and hair, great location, and while Rebecca went away to get a reflector I took a few shots. However with art-nude shots the model rarely looks at the camera, and you don't always need light in the eyes - for these type of shots you do need to consider more how the light falls on the face and not just the body.
Does this sound confusing? Well, think of it like this - the HTML code will do a couple of things.

But I was left in pretty much the same place: without a real community, and only a couple of friends. I started my blog about that time, and started meeting unschoolers online. In the nearly two years since then, I've found a huge community online, one that is supportive and truly amazing (seriously. I love you guys!). I've also made friends in person from across North America, really awesome people whom I want to get to know better, and whom I really wish lived closer... I've learned, unlike what I thought in my early to mid teens, that I'm not unlikeable, and there are plenty of people out there whom I get along with wonderfully.

Kids have none of these. No life perspective, so no understanding that life doesn't have to be abusive. No network or comprehension of resources, so no way out. Very little legal standing without advocacy, so no voice. In short, no options other than to stay where they are and accept it, or try to run away with whatever little resources they have.
Since then I’ve been on a hell of a journey and if I knew then what I know now, I’m pretty sure I never would have gotten sick. But getting sick was a huge wake-up call for me. If I hadn’t gotten sick, I wouldn’t know what I know now and I wouldn’t be living how I’m living now.

First lets talk about seasoning, because God knows, ground turkey needs it bad — it has almost no flavor character whatsoever, being a very lean white meat. We also have to approach it from the perspective that turkey is poultry — it will never be red meat, it can’t ever possibly taste like red meat, and to approach it from a red meat seasoning perspective is just plain asinine and self-defeating.

Everyone talks behind the back of the fat-skinny couple. No one wants to admit it, but they usually do. What they usually say is this – “How do they do it? How do those two have sex?” If the man is the fat one, they picture the skinny woman bungee-cording down on to his penis. If the woman is the fat one, they picture a man scuba diving through a reef of flesh, just to get to the treasure. When you think of foreplay for a fat-skinny couple, you see one dipped in fudge and the other dressed as a turkey. That’s how the fat person gets excited. One man’s yuck is another man’s yum.

The first Saturday afternoon I had no idea what I was in for. I knew where I was to stand, and what I was to do but I had no idea how I’d feel. I checked the weather and shuddered. I bundled up for the weather, although I wore light gloves that would enable me to turn the pages of the book of verses I was going to softly read from to help me stay focused. Two things that I didn’t realize until I took my stand were due to the nearby playground, vehicles would be going past at 30 Km/h and due to the traffic light, there would be vehicles stopped for brief time spans. I got a few looks but nothing that made me feel uncomfortable.
Every kid loves summer vacation but growing up I was also excited about returning to school. Back then I wouldn't haven't articulated it the same way, but I know now that school provided a kind of haven for me, a place where I could imagine and excel. School meant being with friends and supported by adults who cared about me.

You want to spend the rest of your life with him/her and are ready to adjust to make both of you happy. You love him/her for what he/she is and wouldn't want to change him/her for anything in the world. You start feeling that no other person in the world is as beautiful or handsome as him/her. In case you have become overtly concerned about your looks and appearance, know for sure you are in love. When in love loyalty holds more importance than ever in life. You want to be loyal to your beloved and expect the same from him/her. If all of this happens to you, you are definitely in love. Check out our related sections that deal with the issue of being in love, separately for men and women.

Any strongly-held belief is likely to be offensive to someone. Avoiding of offence, either in words or images, is impossible in practice and undesirable in theory. People who complain about trivia, whether to the UCLU or to Ofcom or the Advertising Standards Authority, should be told to get over themselves. UCL's Atheist, Secularist and Humanist Society deserves to be congratulated. They have proved, not merely that they had nothing to apologise for, but that if you stand up to bullies they tend to back down.

Until fairly recently, there was really only one couple on the planet for whom I would save these wines, but they have moved overseas and who knows when (if?) they will be back in Philly again. I tried for a while to convince our long time young-wine loving friends to come over to the Dark Side, but they have resisted (read, they remain close-minded) and if I were an objective person (never been called that to my face), I might agree. You taste a few dogs (bad wines) and you start wondering “What’s the point? Life’s too short to drink wine that tastes like licking the shower floor of a high school locker room.” So I have been sitting on a bunch of wines that I do not know with whom I would drink them (particularly a bunch of champagnes).
Although, as we say, Modern Warfare 3 has yet to eclipse the sales numbers of its technicalpredecessor, it still managed to become the fastest-selling game in history, so it didn’t exactly do too badly.

To be a mother in Israel in the full gospel sense is the highest reward that can come into the life of a woman. This designation has a deep and significant meaning, one that is far more than marrying and bearing children in this life, great and important as that course is. In fact, in the full and true sense of the word, the blessing of being mothers in Israel shall come in due course to some who, through no fault of their own, are denied the opportunity to marry and to bear children in this life.

I love the camaraderie on the sidelines, the conversations with other parents, all of whom are trying to work out how they can best support their treasures and help them find their feet in the world. In our house there is a clear order of preference. My girls love gymnastics the most and they spend hours swinging from a bar we have across one of the doorways or doing tumbles on the gym mat. The level of gymnastics ability in Holland seems to be really high because the things that even the youngest girls in the ‘young talent’ group can do are pretty amazing and that’s just in one club. There are eight or so clubs in the region, there is a great pool of young gymnasts.
The week before Christmas, we received a surprise package from some friends in NC. These girls were from a book club that Abby and I went to in the months before our move. Most of them didn't go to our church and they didn't really know our other children very well. Yet, each of the kids had cards in the box and there were a variety of little treats and toys too. Ryan and I both teared up when they opened it. It seems silly, but the burden we carry for our kids during this whole process can be pretty heavy. It's something that we pray through and discuss a lot. For some reason, receiving that package and seeing that the kids got so excited, not about the contents, but about the fact that these friends remembered them was humbling, overwhelming, and reassuring all at the same time. Lily kept reading and re-reading her card and saying how nice it was that they did that for us.

When the Benson opinion was announced, Chisum noted that an interested observer should have had immediate concerns:
I'm going to guess I'm 5 or 6 here. I'm pretty sure that's a fake smile I'm sporting. Could it be due to the fact that I'm sitting on the lap of one of the creepiest looking scarecrows? Are scarecrows not scary enough without monster alien type half masks on them? I guess not.

These winter tights by Falke are absolutely lovely-a really comfy waistband, soft and warm-just like gloves for your legs!! Made of soft merino wool, they come in sizes from small to extra large and retail at £29.48, as well as being available in a variety of different colours too. They have excellent customer reviews and are a great winter investment-wearing them for the next 6 months will only work out at £5 per month cost per wear!!
I don’t know how, but I survived. I was one of the strong ones. I could still walk unaided and had all body parts present and accounted for. That’s why they asked me to come, to help the few who were still alive. The contamination was still present but at acceptable levels, apparently. I’m not entirely sure about this, but it’s hard to tell when you don’t even have sufficient power to run an x-ray machine. If you could find one that still worked.
“Watching your play,” I told Mark. “was very odd. I somehow lost all my critical faculties. I was listening to the writing and watching the delivery, which so mesmerised me I ended up having no opinion on what I was actually watching except that it was very densely and well written.”
We just discussed how a logo should be designed in order to be enlarged properly. What about being shrunk? Don’t think your logo will ever need to be shrunk? What about profile pictures on social networking sites? What about when you sponsor an event and they want to put a tiny version of your logo on their flyer? If your logo is not very simple, there will be entirely too much going on for it to make sense in a smaller size. Take a picture of 3 pencils on a table with erasers in between them. Shrink the picture to a tiny size. Can you make out what the erasers are? You probably cannot.
I'm huge, uncomfortable, not sleeping and yes, whining about it (Note to my pre-pregnancy self, who is yelling from within to just shut up and be grateful I'm pregnant: I am grateful. And I can also whine about how uncomfortable I am. These thoughts are not mutually exclusive.). I feel like I've been pregnant my entire life. I don't even remember what it feels like to move freely, to sleep in any position I want or to exercise. I am, quite simply, so ready to move onto parenthood, to meet this baby who's made himself at home inside me for almost a year.

Here’s John’s crepe. (Actually, technically, the savory square dinner ones are called “galettes” and the sweet triangular dessert ones are called “crepes,” but I can’t stop calling all of them crepes.

The cake calls for several different coconut flavors: canned coconut milk for both the cake and the frosting, coconut extract for both cake and frosting; oiptional CocoRibe, and fresh or frozen coconut. Rose recommends fresh or frozen coconut so the frosting won't be too sweet. You can also sometimes find packaged unsweetened coconut at the grocery store, and I imagine that would do in a pinch.

There will be many days like today, and some better ones as well, randomly distributed. A youngish, strong man with an elderly person's disease is a lot like a Doberman Pinscher, a breed that was created by crossing the Rottweiler with the Black and Tan Terrier and German Pinscher. While I have known some lovely Dobermans, it is generally a recipe for disaster to combine an energetic, tenacious terrier with a much larger, aggressive animal. My point, admittedly far-fetched, is that Flip's youthfulness in combination with a mind that is rapidly losing its behavioral filters is someone who could become dangerous to himself and others. While I am not afraid of him, today made me aware that he has become unpredictable and cannot be relied upon to be the delightful, intelligent, extremely compassionate man he always was. I just called to see how he's doing tonight and was told there was another episode. It sounds as if he may have had some kind of psychotic break, but perhaps it's just his brain cells exploding like popcorn over a fire.
Glory, glory, to His Name!
Even if I have headed upstairs ten minutes before him, he’s still in bed before me, watching with bemusement from behind his book (we read in bed- so rock and roll) as I go about my night time ceremonials. The other night, as I was doing one of my more unattractive rituals (all will be revealed shortly), he pondered out loud whether other men were as lucky as he to have such an attractive and mysterious girlfriend (very fond of sarcasm is my fiancé). So I thought I’d share my bed time routine on here… partly as a curiosity project (I’d love to know what other peoples routines are), but mainly to try and get some justification for making my ablutions public, or for not going to bed in a little lacey number every night (or any night for that matter- I may as well be honest).
It isn’t a new growth and it isn’t doing a great deal but it is there and it’s best taken out. The Christie hospital in Manchester are going to do that this time, (along with my spleen unfortunately, bugger) probably a bit of my small bowel that it’s touching (oh flippity flops) and then pump heated chemo round my abdomen for 90 mins to wipe up all traces. So this is my second cytoreductive surgery and it’s brilliant news that Christies are doing the HIPEC (heated chemo thingy,) to try and make it my last. It’s brilliant news that I’ve had no new mucin growth in the last 6 months and it’s brilliant news that we have an NHS who at the moment will pick up the bill for this. So folks I’m actually looking forward to it. I’m not spinning you a tall tale, I’m not pretending or putting on a brave face. I’m happy, relaxed and shopping for new PJs! I’ve stocked up my ereader with new books, I’m packing my notebook so I can blog and tweet and my iPod is ready with music, podcasts etc.,
From Gothenburg to Grahamstown, and from Seattle to Seoul, most of our world's modern-day conveniences and comforts have their origins in Europe or people of European origin. Just pause for a minute or two to reflect on the development and greater significance (in rough chronological order) of universities, cartography, printing presses, steam trains and railways, photography, telephone and radio communication, internal-combustion engines, aircraft, television, jet engines, lasers, personal computers and genetic engineering.

The story of Virginia City takes place towards the end of the Civil War, and deals primarily with a last ditch attempt by the Confederacy to secure a bullion shipment which would allow them to fight on. Four years of warfare, and the accompanying blockade, have left the South on the verge of bankruptcy and staring defeat in the face. Their one chance of survival hangs on obtaining the necessary funds to keep them afloat. Virginia City was the site of some of the richest mines in the country and provided the Union with untold wealth. Of course some of those same mines were owned by Confederate sympathisers who had managed to raise $5 million to aid the cause. The difficulty for the South was to get that money out of Nevada and safely into their own territory. Enter Vance Irby (Randolph Scott), a Confederate officer who has the requisite knowledge of the territory to head up an expedition to bring the contraband through. In the film’s opening scenes Irby is in charge of a military prison which counts a certain Captain Kerry Bradford (Errol Flynn) among its inmates. When Irby foils Bradford’s attempt to escape it sets up a personal rivalry between the two men that is added to later on when they meet again in Nevada and find themselves competing for the attentions of saloon singer Julia Hayne (Miriam Hopkins). Although both Bradford and Irby find themselves on opposing sides in the war they have a good deal in common, and indeed end up fighting shoulder to shoulder against a mutual threat in the closing stages. Since both of the leads were cast in essentially heroic roles it meant that another, more obvious, villain was needed. That’s where Humphrey Bogart comes in, playing the mustachioed Mexican bandit John Murrell.
One of the funnier moments was the 'Weekend Update' segment with Seth Meyers. The satirical news desk show poked fun at Donald Trump and his Celebrity Apprentice show.
The logic is perverse. If we find Abdulmutallab in an al-Qaeda training camp in Yemen, where he is merely preparing for a terror attack, we snuff him out with a Predator -- no judge, no jury, no qualms. But if we catch him in the United States in the very act of mass murder, he instantly acquires protection not just from execution by drone but even from interrogation.

Some may complain that The Iron King is basically a bunch of old YA tropes mixed together in a soup pot. This is certainly true, but these elements mashed together work well or they wouldn’t be used in so much YA fiction. Julie Kagawa’s novel not only has an interesting (but admittedly clichéd) plot, but is well-written and emotionally resonating. I found myself actually caring about the characters because Meghan, Ethan, Ash and Puck are all well-developed archetypes. So if you’re looking for an excellent, slightly clichéd Young Adult novel, The Iron King is certainly the book for you.

“A peacefully negotiated secession was the best way to handle all the problems facing America in 1860. A war of coercion was Lincoln’s creation.

When I got to the park it was really busy. It turned out that there were over 11,000 entrants, and nearly 8,000 runners. They had run out of small and medium shirts, which was a shame because I like my shirt. It’s a cool design blending Edinburgh Castle into the New York skyline. I grabbed a large shirt and my bib. I was super excited about seeing my new corral given my vastly improved bib time, but it turned out it was just in the 4,000s, given the size of the race. Still, when I went to my corral, I have to admit that I was a little intimidated by the other runners; they all looked so… runner-like.

One of the things I came to realise afterwards, was there seems to be very little good tattoo photography about. There are millions of photos on the web, but most are very amateur. It seemed odd to me that people can pay hundreds of pounds, even thousands, for their tattoos, and yet the best photo they have of them was taken on a phone or a cheap camera in poor lighting.

This is the second day that I've spent with this incredibly horrible sensation that I've done something just awful and I'm going to get caught. Something wrong wrong wrong and any moment I'm busted. I can feel it in my chest and in my belly and in my upper arms and forearms. Anxiety. Heavy pressing anxiety. My therapist even identified it for me. Throw that in with the flighty thoughts all night until 6 a.m., even though I'm in bed, two nights in a row, I guess this has turned a little hypomanic.

First I found the Wiki definition of Euphoria which explains that euphoria is”an affect, but the term is often colloquially used to define emotion as an intense state of transcendent happiness combined with an overwhelming sense of contentment.” It has also been defined as an “affective state of exaggerated well-being or elation.” That is what I want! An overwhelming sense of contentment as a wife and parent; to be completely content with life and to be overly happy about it.

The erect pricklypear can be identified by flat green segments that are not the leaves but the stems, which can measure up to 30 cm. It also has eyes that contain 0-11 spikes. The eyes of a cactus are called areola; areolas are the structures that spikes grow out of and the spikes are actually modified leaves. The areolas can grow roots when separated from their mother plant, which remain viable for months after detachment.

The rest of these musicians are not nearly as extreme as Sugimoto, but they do share his thoughtfulness and deliberation. It is therefore a rare pleasure to see guitarist Keith Rowe at work in revealing closeups that put the emphasis squarely on the techniques he uses to produce his sounds. Rowe places his instrument flat on a tabletop, surrounded by effect pedals, springs, handheld fans, radios, and assorted metal objects, all of which are used to excite the guitar's strings in interesting ways, creating textured sound fields. Throughout the film, Leddington explores the various means of sound production these musicians deploy: the alien squeaks and cries of vocalist Ami Yoshida, the sine wave samples of Sachiko M, the relatively traditional guitar of Burkhard Stangl, the eccentric percussive array of Günter Müller, the bare turntables and gadgets of Otomo Yoshihide. Balance Beams provides a perspective better even than the average audience member at one of these shows, creating an experience that is not just a document of a particular festival, but a summary of this movement's philosophy of sound and music.

By God’s grace this isn’t a debtors ethic that I’m carrying around. That is, I don’t feel I have to pay people back because they have paid me with something. Rather, the grace of others toward me has shown me how beautiful it is to give and has made me want to be that way toward others.
This early canon of rock criticism came under attack in the punk era, and in the eighties and early nineties rock studies repeatedly warned against the ‘romantic primitivism’ of an authenticity cult (Middleton, 1990). Some observers abandoned the concept altogether but others took a more sober stand:

The most difficult part of anything for me is discipline and consistency and doing what needs to be done, not just what I want to do. So it was tough to make myself sit down and do the technical work, the revising and proofreading and planning. It’s nothing to sit down and write the most exciting scene, that’s as good as reading or watching a movie. It’s writing all the in-between bits and cleaning up the mess that is hardest for me.

Even ordinary works can, if in surprising places, prompt a myriad of responses. The Nags Head in Shrewsbury, has an unusual and painting with an obscure origin. It has an unusual context in being on the inside door of a cupboard in a room above the pub. There is a strange atmosphere up there, where the temperature can plummet in seconds. Some think the painting depicts Neptune, others, the Devil. It is thought to be by a prisoner of war during World War II but staff at the local Rowley's House Museum purvey only a mystic tale but no accurate record. One told me it is of a woman who committed suicide by jumping from an upstairs window. In this legend it is said that the female figure will return if painted over. The painting is not of a woman but there is an ambiguity as the figure has feminine legs which are disproportionately long and thick, and a short body. This painting prompts wonder, amusement, mystification, delight.

That didn't last long. After a week or so, we were all getting on each others nerves. The double wide was put together though we still had no utilities. We decided we'd make do. So we moved out to the property, and essentially camped in our house for about two weeks. We cooked with camp stoves and grills. Anything cold had to be kept in coolers, and we bought a lot of ice. Water was hauled in with camping jugs. Really, and truly it wasn't bad. It felt good to be out on the property, and if it wasn't for all the unpacking and organizing, it would have felt like a mini vacation.
In the beginning of December, I got an email from my mother that my aunt Bonnie (my dad's brother's sister) was in the hospital in critical condition. She was suffering from something called C. diff (which after looking it up sounds particularly nasty) and had her colon removed, which then was followed by her kidneys and liver failing. Come to find out she had actually been hospitalized since Halloween. She went dramatically downhill from there and passed away on the 4th of December. According to my father, she was nearly unresponsive at the end, and "They were gathered around her bedside reminiscing, and Neil (my uncle) looked over at Bonnie and saw a tear run down her cheek. At that moment her heart stopped. Neil said, "She made the decision for us.""

Portero is crazy, really just so odd! With every new occurance, and each new creature that made an appearance, I was thinking "Are you serious?!" with a huge grin on my face. I've reviewed a fair amount of urban fantasy novels, and so I'm used to reading about strange creatures and happenings, but Bleeding Violet is written in a way that makes you stop and think "What?", and it's just so awesome! I think it must be Hanna's narration. Being diagnosed and misdiagnosed with several different mental illnesses, as the story goes on, Hanna is never sure if the things that are happening are real or made up, and it's her surprise and yet easy acceptance of what's going around her that make it a little more surprising for the reader than other urban fantasies. You know, I think I would go as far as saying the creatures and events that happen may more be conventions of a high fantasy, where as the characters, relationships, and just everyday goings on are very normal, or conventional of an urban fantasy. It's the meshing of the two that is just so awesome, yet so bizarre!

To be fair, 8mm puts forth a decent effort to mimic the tone and style of films of the era. It does so with the general coarseness of the modern day era, with a lot of perversion thrown in for good measure. I am not kidding about that, either. Snippets of actual DSM films are sprinkled throughout Welles journey through the underground world of pornography. It is like descending into hell. The further he goes, more sinister it gets until he finds the people producing literal snuff films for the sexual pleasure of those who can afford them. I am an a traditionalist. I do not appreciate modern day nihilistic horror creeping into to favored movie genres just for the sake of making it edgy and contemporary.

That night, by the dim light of the lamp, he opened up a big geography book. There was a particular chapter of the book that he really liked. This was about a German explorer climbing a mountain range, named Lunae Montes or mountains of the moon by the ancient Greeks, in Africa. He had read this passage many times. Everytime he read it, he dreamt that he would also climb mountains of the moon some day. Dreams! This would remain just as far as the real mountains of the moon… as if mountains of the moon ever descended to the earth!

I understand that there are suitable facilities currently willing to provide Yupi with a permanent home where she can enjoy an expansive natural space to roam, more complex environments, and a colder, more suitable climate.

It's amazing seeing creative young minds at work. Liam (2) thought it was fun just to take the beads out of their packages and count them as he put them back in there containers. Ashlynn put alot of thought into her colors and shapes as she created this bracelet. When she was finished, she beamed at me with pride as I wrapped the finishing loop so she could wear it. She said, "Auntie Dawn, my Daddy is going to be so proud of me. I need to put this in my backpack to show him."
Mr. Parsons said in an interview on Sunday that last year the Global Fund deposited $12.3 million in foreign currency into Zimbabwe’s Reserve Bank. He declined to speculate on how the $7.3 million it was seeking to be returned had been spent, except to say it was not on the intended purpose. Civic groups and opposition officials maintain that the Reserve Bank helps finance Mr. Mugabe’s patronage machine.
Minimalist living can be whatever you want or need it to be for you.
Mr. Perry’s more notable work revolves around his Madea character for which he has been praised to a large extent. But less well known is the criticism that condemns his work as buffoonery at a time when a lot of black people are struggling for respect and equal treatment. Black people love his movies and Mr. Perry is more than ready to give his audience what it wants. But if his chickens are rooted in comic stereotypes that help reinforce every negative stereotype about black people, should Mr. Perry be surprised when those chickens come home to roost and the police approach him the way that they would approach his Madea character? What else has Mr. Perry given people to consider about black people?
And although I tried very hard to avoid dwelling on the potential symbolism of a lost wedding ring, I am quite happy to inject its recovery with all manner of meaning. Love endures. Don’t give up hope. Pick your own cliché – they’re all positive.
It can be a friend at church or elsewhere that speaks a word of wisdom into our lives because of what they have been through or because the Lord has prompted them to.

Consider it, then, a glimpse into a possible future: one in which a genius—whose unique skills brought him from the dawn of his artform to the brink of its next evolutionary step; from the Nickelodeon era to the beginnings of D.W. Griffith and Charlie Chaplin—might have either progressed, or dissipated. Could this man of the theatre, this magician, have embraced a medium that had grown up? Conquest offers clues.

Instead, the biggest topic on most news shows this past week was about was how Two and a Half Men killed off Charlie Sheen's character.

After I had the counter looking the way I wanted I sealed it with polyurethane. I believe that I did 7 coats, I didn't count. I just kept going until I got the desired shine.
No one cared. And really, it’s silly of me to expect them to.
The task force asked the Justice Department’s capital-case review unit to look over its work, but the fact that it failed to prevent the execution was never publicized. There was other inculpatory evidence in Boyle's case - most prominently a fingerprint on the duct tape used to bind the victim - but the example further demonstrates, if more evidence were needed, the common use of uncertain forensic methods even (perhaps especially) in high stakes cases.
Prior to watching, I had it in my mind that Star Wars was very neutral territory as far as films go. Having watched the film I can say that my overall impression of it is that it’s cute! I was already very familiar with the plot. It was like I’d seen the whole thing before in a dream and then I experienced it in real life. I basically had seen the whole thing except for some of the less culturally popular filler bits. My conclusion is that you don’t even have to see the movie to understand it because it is so culturally prevalent; it’s not just a nerd thing. Before seeing Star Wars I knew that (spoilers) Darth Vader is Luke’s father, I knew that Chewbacca talks funny, and I knew what a storm trooper looks like. However, I suggest that you watch the films at least once so that you don’t have to give weak excuses to your friends when they ask why you haven’t seen one of the most well-known movies of all time.

Two beautiful boys, with gorgeous eyes, the close-cropped hair reminiscent of days in the Aggie corps of cadets, chiseled faces and strong hands. And in those eyes, as they drink and study their hands, throw chips and talk, I see their anguish and it makes me so sad. I don't know why their marriages are breaking up. I don't know what they were like at home, whether they weren't available or whether they ran around. But what I do know is that they're not running around tonight because they're here with me. At this table, with seven other boys. Shuffling chips and counting cards, absentmindedly looking at the fight on TV ever so often as the button continues its never ending rotation around the table.
After being given a guard of honour by the home side, Madrid made a shaky start to proceedings and the Spanish giants found themselves a goal down in the fifth minute. Picking the ball up on the halfway line after dispossessing Marcelo, Jara stormed past Ricardo Carvalho into the box before coolly slipping the ball underneath Antonio Adan’s legs to find the back of the net.

Another reason why we don't see men selling their wares in Speedos is--and let me know if I'm wrong about this--women are simply not that turned on by the perfect male form.

Ah, that piece. Canvaswork is constrained by the up and down threads. I've played with a lot of designs to push that. One of my pieces that won a lot of recognition included a five-sided figure. That was a real challenge. Circles are a challenge. Curves are a challenge.
In saying that, I am so pleased to see that we all persisted with the pieces with a few of us completing both projects.
Thank you and goodbye,
From the above the three I would say the only look I like is Megan's, though its not anything amazing in terms of fashion it does flatter her. Jessinta is to be commended on trying something a little different, however, it does look a little frumpy.
This is a wonderful book that, essentially, is about the importance of identity in contributing to our sense of belonging.

In measuring, the topic of volume is moved to third grade in accordance to Common Core Standards. The topics in 2nd grade include inches, half-inches, centimeters, feet, miles, meters, kilometers, and weight in pounds and in kilograms. Compared to the earlier edition, I have added line plots, exercises about measuring objects both in inches and in centimeters, estimating lengths, and finding how much longer one thing is than another.

Well, they always say that research is key to progress and that knowledge is power. Too much of something is bad enough though. So do keep your sanity and know when to stop researching. Most of all, let us live our own lives apart from the lives we may have in the gay bar or with an MD special someone. Keep your individuality and don’t let your life revolve around the gay bar.

The other thing about these bars is that watering down is the norm. You pretty much have to be in VIP to get the potent stuff. That goes for beer on tap. Must be a cultural thing.
This is on the corner of Goldhawk Road which is somewhat out of central London and is the sister pub of the Bree Louise. Now the Bree tends to divide opinion; while some people warm to its esoteric charm, others won’t enter the place without a fumigation suit. The DOC is very different to its sister pub in some ways, but similar enough in others to keep most people happy.

Doing the good and right things can be hard and is not always easy. We must think clearly about the right reactions to have and the right actions to take. We must have courage to do good and bring light into others. If we aren’t careful we can easily tire, so be mindful. Nevertheless, challenge yourself to do one good thing for someone else today.

Either of the three proposals would be superior to our existing system of unemployment insurance. Critically, by establishing a separate and dedicated tax and reserve fund for job insurance, the Federal government could create a permanent fiscal structure for a jobs program, which would form the nucleus of a Federal commitment to full employment for all.

The explosion of colors in the hillside was nowhere to be found, the trees lining the streets were still verdant, but the lady at the local pizza restaurant where my husband and I and four other tourists in this quaint town of Quincy - the seat of Plumas County - told us to head out to the fairgrounds as there were some trees that had changed colors.

I haven’t been too worried about the swimming part as I have always been a good and fast swimmer, compared to most people anyway. I was on the swim team for years and have a whole album full of 3rd-7th place ribbons to prove that the water and I get along just fine. But just to be sure I jumped in the pool and although I was breathing like I had a collapsed lung I still did all 16 laps on the first attempt. The running portion doesn’t have me too worried either as I can walk if I have to and I can always remove my race number and act like a pedestrian in a hurry if my lack of progress becomes too humiliating. What does have me worried is the biking leg of this whole thing. I didn’t think that 12 miles was such a big deal until I got in the saddle. I thought, no big deal, I had a huffy with a banana seat and the ace of spaids in my spokes as a child and later upgraded to a 10 speed that I routinely rode between my neighbor’s house and my own, which had to be at least a quarter mile apart. Well, it didn’t take long for me to realize that the car is hands down the greatest invention ever, whereas if you had asked before my attempt to pedal 12 miles I would have said electricity. So thank you, Mr. Benz, for inventing the automobile, you have saved many a woman from hurting in their special place.

Having been banished from Asgard, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) enlists the help of an alien army who promise to win him the Earth in exchange for the Tesseract, a source of unlimited power. And so Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson), director of S.H.I.EL.D, brings together Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) along with two of his own agents, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), to create the Avengers. This latest epic instalment in the movie franchise is set to be the ultimate marvel blockbuster to date!

Each of the characters are incredibly relatable and down to earth. Most of all, I enjoyed Audrey and her appreciation for life. She never lost her bubbly personality and stayed strong until the very end. Mason, Daisy's adoptive father, is also a great character from the very start. Upon being incredibly smart, he's also very loving and protective, which I think many more readers will learn to appreciate more towards the end of the story.

ANC governments have spent billions of dollars on job training programmes only to see large sums lost to corruption, while producing few graduates with skills required by employers.
You will be way ahead of most of us if you'll simply be aware of the truth that just as soon as you think you "know" about rabbits...then you've exposed your ignorance. Rabbits, like all other sentient beings, are beautiful, smart, complex and worthy of respect and knowing. And knowing one bunny only means you know that bunny...each bunny being...like each human being...is an individual and is unique. But knowing takes time, interest, effort and the slow discovery that the quest for comprehension and understanding is probably unending.

I have continued to volunteer for the Australian Breastfeeding Association this year. My main role this year has been that of co-group leader. I took myself off email and phone counselling halfway through this year so that I could focus on parenting my little baby. Actually, the day that Gideon was born was meant to be my last helpline shift! I had him about 45 minutes before my shift was due to start. Chris couldn't work out how to log me off so the phone kept ringing for ages until he figured it out!
Anyhow, all this talk of Sheila has drawn me to the Mature Courtesans website where until recently she advertised her person. The madam of this establishment is one Helga who apparently has 'gone away' for now - and I must say Helga's business is a tribute to the kind of fine manners we should expect in these times of Old Etonian governance, even if her grasp on grammar and syntax is not.
In another part of the book Martha talks about a friend of hers who has a child with Down syndrome and how her friends mother blamed her friend for not praying hard enough for a normal child. Because prayer was going to magically change the number of chromosomes in this child?
The approach of splitting the dealing with such terms into procedurally unfair and substantially unfair is rather unique and this author knows not of any other jurisdiction within the Commonwealth that has chosen this approach. It is also, in this author’s view, rather needless and unneccessary. A substantially unfair contract term is neccessarily procedurally unfair as well. The two are not mutually exclusive. There is also the troubling question of what would about to inadaquate justification for breach of express or implied terms of a contract. When is the justification adaquate and when is it not? Presumably this follows the approach of determining if whether the exclusion of such terms are fair and reasonable or not, but for this to work the statute itself must give an account of what “adaquate justification” amounts to rather then just simply leave the matter for the courts. Such an approach would be in tandem with those used in other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom in their Law Commission’s proposed Unfair Contract Terms Bill 2005, specifically clase 14(1) which provides a test on how contract terms are deemed not fair and reasonable. It is also noted that Malaysia has decided that exclusion or limitation of liability for negligence is to be disallowed outright rather than having it hang on whether such an exclusion or limitation is fair and reasonable or as the Bill puts it “without adaquate justification”.

“The common enemy of humanity is man. In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.”
Finally, Simon Stokes’ book notes a further exception for pre CDPA photographs (which along with original prints and similar works where there can be many ‘originals’ must surely cause problems when this provision is applied?).

Doug said, though with a rather mischievous grin, that he didn't actually think the character was all that awful, and he found himself identifying with him, and even feeling that in certain circumstances he too could hit someone on the head with a hammer. I think by this he was implying that the prose was so good it drew you into Freddie's psychology, however horrible. Others, however, didn't feel that it did. John said that he was alienated by the self-consciously fine writing, the long passages without variety of tone, the sameness of the obsessive viewpoint without the relief of others. Jenny said she hadn't enjoyed reading it at all: it was made quite clear from the start that Freddie was a murderer and a horrible person, and there was no further development on that notion: all that the book was was an explication of that, and it wasn't an enjoyable experience.

I’ve been thinking. A lot. On a particular story, and I’ve been so deeply in the mindset of this story that I didn’t know it changed how I viewed the world. Then, I picked up another, half finished, half planned story on a totally different subject and my mind clashed. My left brain clashed with my right. They melded together (Vulcan mind meld ftw!) and now I’m left in a state of awe.
All in all, I tremendously enjoyed this series and cannot wait to read more of it--The Iron Knight, Ash's story, will be released some time later in the year and you can totally bet I'll be reading it.

For those of you interested in the Berber (Tamazight) languages, there's a enew blog concentrating on those spoken in Libya and Egypt (Siwi in the Siwa Oasis, the only Berber language spoken in Egypt). The author calls it Oriental Berber, (I can see the name may raise questions, since "Oriental" carries a lot of baggage when "Eastern" might have done fine, and "Berber" may annoy some activists. It's a collaborative blog by three authors, one of them Lameen Souag of the Jabal al-Lughat and more recently the blog on Algerian Dardja etymology, الأصول التاريخية للدارجة الجزائرية, which I introduced here recently. Souag's post about the new blog is here. His other collaborators are Marijn van Putten of Phoenix's Blog, and Adam Benkato.

And when you are getting close to publication – when you are getting personalised rejections – get a website up, start blogging, get on FB and Twitter and build relationships. Don’t just promote yourself: be interesting and supportive. You need to be doing that at least six months before the book comes out. I didn’t. I was too busy writing, the family was very busy, I’m shy and don’t like the idea of self-promotion. Well, six months on and I’m still struggling to catch up. You have to get yourself out there. On the positive side, I love school visits and working with the children almost as much as writing. It’s a rare privilege

People who satisfied by extrinsic rewards are, I think, less sure of themselves. They need their boss to applaud them. They need a cheap metallic artifact on their desk. They need laudatory loudness. They need their egos nourished by the outside because they can't feed their ego themselves.

In the end, Carter saves the day. The war is over. Mission accomplished. He even wins over the Martian people and gets their princess to marry him (Lynn Collins, by the way, looks nothing like Afghanistan’s President Karzai). It’s bittersweet though, because once he’s happy, those nasty uber-aliens fling him back home. The same thing they did to Bush in 2008. Like Carter, Bush now spends his time in his basement study—he dubbed it “Mission Control 2”—plotting trips to Mars.

At the Cantab, the regular patrons don’t know my name. They don’t want to know it. They know all their second cousins, and I’m not one of ‘em, all right? During my most recent visit, the guy to my right seemed to have misgivings the minute I sat down at the bar. His mood didn’t improve when I pulled out my camera. He turned to me and said, “Move your umbrella.” I looked down. There was my umbrella, leaning against my stool (ah, but there’s the problem perhaps: it wasn’t my stool, was it? No plaque). I asked him what was wrong with where it was. He leaned over to me and said in a tone that was very dark and very, very damp, “I don’t want to touch it.” I moved the umbrella.

Then, as a group, we parade through town arm-in-arm, while most of the village is out on the street cheering and checking out what everyone is wearing. We parade to the church, where all of the students are blessed, and give thanks for the accomplishments. In Orthodox churches, women must cover their heads to go inside. Probably one of the funniest things was seeing all of the girls, in the short and some revealing dresses, having to cover their heads to go into the church.

We had 2 ½ hours left until we arrived in Boulder, Colorado, but it appeared the gods had other plans for us. The wind whipped us violently, and made us her yo-yo for the evening. We swayed between lanes despite my best efforts to hold the steering wheel steady. The weather’s mood swings was definitely giving me whiplash.
Fix a length of cotton between the hearts and sandwich them together, then fix the end of the cotton above and behind the aperture, using double sided tape, so that the heart hangs and rotates freely in the aperture.
The best place for moisture-wicking material is places where moisture causes a problem, but provides little benefit. Diapers, for example. Or feet, for example. Wet feet rub excessively, the moisture softens the skin, soft skin rubbing makes blisters faster. So, moisture wicking socks = good thing. Hikers have known this for years. Wear soft cotton socks, get blisters. Wear polypro liners and wool socks. Walk all day without blisters.

I think my mind is breaking because a question like that just causes me to go into a feedback loop. Have you seen the classic film Forbidden Planet? In it, a commander instructs a robot to kill a crew member. According to Issac Asimov’s Laws of Robotics, “A robot (he pronounced them ‘ro-bits’) may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.” But the second Law of Robotics is, “A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings.” Clearly, the robot is given two contradictory orders. Sparks fly and the robot goes round and round in its head, which you can see because it is a glass dome, until the commander instructs the robot to disregard the order. The commander is doing it to prove a point, and it makes a very stark analogy that only science fiction can*.

Since we've moved to Florida, our lives have changed quite a bit. Some things, although they seemed like a curse at first, are now looking a little more like blessings. When we first moved, I refused to sign my kids up for sports. First, I wasn't sure where or how to sign them up. Secondly, I didn't have the money to pay for registration fees and uniforms and such. Also, being new to town, I didn't have any friends with whom to carpool. I wasn't sure how work was going to go and how much time I'd have to devote to a sports schedule, especially with no friends to help me out by getting a kid to practice now and then. I felt like I was depriving my kids by not letting them participate in baseball, football, dance, softball, hockey, etc. But now? I feel a little differently.
Next step, BRUSH on Minwax Special Walnut stain. I brushed it on because you can get so much more into your wood using a brush than using a cloth. I let it soak in for about 15 minutes and then took a clean, dry rag and wiped off any stain that didn't soak in. Then I let dry completely for several hours.

On this particular Saturday night, as Rachel and I flew down the road, I looked down at myself and discovered I was wearing (1) camo pants, (2) a scarf & (3) an old 4x sweatshirt of my brother’s emblazoned “Fat City Tavern.”
I discovered something about myself from that swim. I realised that if I decide to do something, if I believe it, I can achieve it. That’s a hard thing to admit, because it’s one of my man’s more irritating mantras and it drives me up the wall, across the ceiling and down the other side. We have had countless arguments over the concept because I can’t just believe something without any evidence, experience or proof. I believed I could do the swim because I’ve swum 50 or 60 or even 100 lengths before so 200 lengths didn’t seem completely out of reach for me. Challenging, yes, but I believed it was possible because I’d done something similar before. I’d climbed a smaller mountain.

rd: Our first tie of the evening has two very different bands. I think Cherry Filter will be able to fill a similar role that Kim Kyungho is filling on the show right now since their music does tend towards metal, but from their cover album and their more pop-oriented songs, I think they’ll have more breadth than Kim and it would be interesting to see if that’s the case. As for MOT, they might face the same difficulty of sounding too much the same every round. Now, I personally love their sound, but their style is so quiet and introspective that it might not win over the audience, which seems to prefer high drama and bombast.

Assuming that the Millennium is, by divine design, when 99.9999% of the plan of salvation will take place, meaning that 99.9999% of God’s children will be saved at that time, polygyny and monogamy may have been used during the preceding 6000 years to limit the number of children coming to earth. The time just preceding the Millennium, though, may be the right time to bring back (or restore) the multihusband-multiwife marriage system, in preparation for the great Millennium.
Please allow me to inform you of an initiative being taken by a former UN official who is endeavoring to have the Nuclear Security Summit take up the crucial problem of N0.4 reactor of Fukushima.

Cigarettes are (spoiler alert) dangerous and bad for you. They can ruin your health in all manner of hideous and frankly disgusting ways, despite making you look cool as shit while they're doing it. What Truth seems to be overlooking is that "ruins your body" is not the major selling point of tobacco. It also feels amazing. Glass Pops, on the other hand, are dangerous, ruin your body, and have zero pleasurable effects. They are effectively pain sticks and serve no other purpose, and this makes the comparison a pile of STFU.
Anybody remember the Cold War? Well, the Soviet Union may be history, but the Russians still operate on the same principles and The KGB’s Poison Factory: From Lenin to Litvinenko ($25.00, Zenith Press, Quayside Publishing) by Boris Volodarsky reveals how, since 1917, the Russian security services have regularly carried out “bespoke” poisoning operations all over the world to eliminate what it regards as enemies of the Kremlin. The most recent to gain notoriety was in November 2006 when Alexander Litvenko, a former Lt. Colonel of the Russian Security Service was murdered in London using a sophisticated poison. The author maintains it was just one episode in a chain of murders that continues to the present day. This is a very scary look at a ruthless regime. To gain an insight to how this came about, read Conspirator: Lenin in Exile by Helen Rappaport ($27.95, Basic Books), a vivid account of seventeen years of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin’s life spent on the run or hiding in Europe as he plotted the revolution in Russia that overthrew the czar in 1917 and initiated the Soviet Union, an experiment in communism that would kill millions of Russians. It is the arduous, lonely, and frustrating years in places that included London, Geneva, Paris, Krakow, Zurich, Copenhagen and Stockholm that are the focus of this historian’s examination of how this master conspirator and strategist planned and plotted to change history. It took extreme patience and persistence, a ruthless dedication, but Lenin made it happen. This is the stuff of great, if tragic, history. To understand Russia, one must understand Lenin.

Thence to the ball, and was mid conversation with two charming young ladies. Viz. Lady Slinkeczexnia and Miss Rearsberg, when I was suddenly distracted by the announcement of the latest female guest. Made my excuses to the two ladies. Viz. with whom I would later conjoin into a most diverting ménage à trois. Upon reaching my viewpoint onto the entrance hall, I was transfixed by this latest female arrival. Viz. …..The Lady of the Fans….. She stood there dressed in taffeta so colourful that all around her may just as well have been dressed for mourning. No sooner than her name was announced than she received a mighty influx of suitors. I stood there, my mask concealing all but my eyes, hers concealed behind her fan, which, upon inspection was elaborately decorated in bright colours to match her silk dress.
Okay, I thought, maybe this will open my eyes up to any blind spots I may have about my own space. Maybe someone will tear me apart, maybe someone will “get” me. Maybe this will help me grow. I think deep down I was simply hoping someone would say, “Good job, keep it up.” Regardless, my insecurity and need for approval reared its ugly head and before I knew it I was registered. Gulp.

As is our M.O., when on vacation my family typically decides what we want to do, when we arrive - we pick a neighborhood and then let the day take us where it may (with the exception of most of our meals, of course!). On our second day in Singapore this holiday, we decided to take a stroll around a popular tourist area, Clarke Quay - which lead to a fantabulous all-day adventure on the river as well as soaring 57 stories above the city!
Sometimes during movies I try to predict what will happen next but this film constantly surprised me on how it develops with at least two red herrings which have you expecting one conclusion and you get something completely different. It’s interesting how Bogart’s character is jaded by his fighting in Italy, a favourite battlefield for ambiguous characters in movies post WW2 as Italy was a slow and unpleasant slog without the best troops and kit, so it was easy to give characters from that campaign those attributes of seeming somewhat second best. Everyone is a dreamer in this movie. The gangsters dream of the good days of prohibition and fervently wish it would return. The women are interesting as the moll has a heart wrenching song about being stuck in an abusive relationship and longs for some stability, and Bacall wishes for family and purpose.

Although I've been unable to locate Annie in the 1891 Census, in 1901 she was single and living in Kensington, London, where she worked as a parlour maid for a brewery manager. It is tempting to conclude that she found this position through brewery trade contacts in Burton. Her elder brother William was still living in Winshill and working as a brewery labourer in 1891 and 1901. Her unmarried status is a little difficult to reconcile with Karen's description of her as "Mrs Annie Goodwin née Orchard," although she may well have married after 1901.

Old people like me who grew up on Michael Jackson’s books will have heard the story of Strong Suffolk.

None of their surviving contemporaries do that any more. It’s a unique relic in British brewing.

You could link if you want to, but that bogs things down and it’s easy enough to cut and paste.

No worries. Something about Portland keeps the river qualities alive, even amid the rush of wealth and youth. The Lab has made a counterintuitive gamble, recreating the Hawthorne pub's vibe piece by piece. Built in a warehouse, the pub occupies a vast space that is scattered with a field of tables. A separate room has been notched out of the pub, just as in the Hawthorne site. The long, handcrafted wooden bar is there, as is the outside seating, suitable for canine companions. Even the menu is identical to Hawthorne's. Two differences: the floor is cement, not scarred wood, and the light fixtures are fashioned from kegs (very cool). In short: new pub, same as the old pub.

But truly, Christi is a great conversationalist and friend, and the best illustrator you have ever met: having been top of her high school and college classes in science, she became a scientific illustrator (if you need a brochure depicting water buffalo habits, hire Christi), plus she is a painter and designer and expert at some kind of obscure martial art ninja thing, blahblahblah, and world traveler, and as I say she has her act together, she is also a LANDLORD which is a smart move for an artist, renting out an apartment, and farmer too.

Later, though, she reappears at the educated man's house. Her husband has died and her son has been carried off by a wolf. Because she is perceived now to be unlucky she is taken on with apprehension, and forbidden to touch any of the sacrifice paraphernalia for fear of annoying the ancestors. This causes her distress, and she is ridiculed for endlessly repeating the story of her stupidity of allowing her child to be carried off by a wolf. Eventually someone tells her that even in the afterlife she will be punished as both her husbands will want her and they will tear her in half. To prevent this she uses all her earnings to buy a 'threshold' so that she will be trodden on by the population which will prevent future punishment. Believing herself to be purified by this, she is even more distressed when again she is prevented from having anything to do with the sacrifice.

The government cannot possibly sustain economic growth and reduce poverty with statist actions and solutions. The way out of poverty is not through adoption of more laws and regulatory economic policies. The only way to solve these pressing, worsening economic issues is to free the economy. Since the issues of poverty reduction and economic growth are both economic and political/constitutional issues, Balisacan’s solutions cannot do anything to secure long-term economic growth. In fact they would only worsen the country’s economic problems. Because even if you seize all the property and incomes of the top 30% or 40% of this country, the collected revenue would not be enough to finance all government services, programs and welfare for at least two to three months.

Industry concentration statistics tell the story here. The conventional measure of concentration, the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) ranges from 0 to 10,000; the HHI for the software industry as a whole is less than 244 for software, compared to an average of 334 for U.S. manufacturing industries. What this means is that the top 20 sellers of pre-packaged software generate 61% of total industry revenues. This compares very favorably to other industries, many of which are considered quite competitive: autos, airlines, and personal computers, for example. There is evidence of significant turnover over time as well – a key indicator of a dynamic industry. Of the top ten software companies in 1990, five did not make the list in 2000, either because they went out of business or were acquired. This is remarkable turnover compared to some industries, such as pharmaceuticals, where similar comparisons from 1990 and 2000 show that eight of ten firms made both lists (and the ones that did not were acquired by others that did) Comparative Data on Patents and Innovation - to determine how patents relate to these trends, one area of study looked at comparative data concerning differences between the domestic software industries of various countries. Previous research has shown that as a foreign country moves up the learning curve in the software industry, inventors in the software industry from that country receive more patents. Accordingly, software firms in Israel, Ireland and India were studied to see if the patenting trends hold:

Many people analyzing this picture see it as show of strength for the president. He's casually sitting there with a serious look on his face, surrounded by generals, Pentagon officials and cabinet staff. He has an air of unquestioned authority. He isn't sitting front and center in a big throne, because he doesn't have to. Nobody wonders whether or not he's in charge; his team works for him, but they also all work together - including the president. The phrase 'Protector in Chief" has been used to describe his new role, as defined by the picture, and I can't disagree; solemn, serious, but not in an approachable way. He comes off in the picture as someone that we can trust to make the right decision, but he'll also comfort us if that decision is a tough one.
I started when their twins were 3 months old. They were the BEST babies ever. I very quickly bonded with them. The parents were at first great, too. Said I was a part of the family that they were so glad to have me and all that. The pay sucked from the beginning, but I was desperate for a job. They originally offered $250 a week for 45 hours, but promised additional compensation for any hours over that, and promised raises at 6 months, 1 year, so on and so forth. They also said my job was strictly to take care of the twins, and the only chores I had to do was clean up my own mess, wash the baby bottles, and do the babies laundry. At first they went out of their way to make me feel welcome. They asked what food I would like in the house, they often brought me home dinner, asked how my day was with genuine concern, and were very polite. The problems started around when the babies turned 6 months.

The conventional picture book is 32 pages long or a multiple of 8 due to how picture books are normally bound. In modern picture books, contradiction between word and images are becoming more popular as it may appeal to the humour of both the adult and child. One example of a contradictory picture book is ‘NO’ by Marta Altes. Another interesting trait is that picture books are beginning to address serious issues such as ‘Rabbityness’ by Jo Empson which tackles death (this is influenced by her own experience) The challenge for any illustrator is to make the picture book work on many levels.
However, an important study by tax economists Joel Slemrod and Alan Auerbach found that such reductions in reported income largely reflect timing and other tax avoidance strategies that taxpayers adopt to minimize their taxable income, not changes in real work, savings, and investment behavior. While such strategies entail some economic costs, these costs are relatively modest. Moreover, policymakers can limit high-income taxpayers’ ability to respond to increases in tax rates by engaging in tax avoidance activity — and also enhance the efficiency of the tax code — by broadening the tax base, as discussed below.

Again, not boring you with the saga, but, as most people who know 3D art know, trueSpace went bye-bye a few years ago. Obviously, I could keep using it, but the software has a lot of issues. So, over the past few years, I’ve been trying various free software packages, but I’ve not been really happy with any of them. Late last year, a friend e-mailed me and told me he was upgrading Lightwave and asked me if I wanted Lightwave 10 for free. Naturally, I said “yes,” as this is $1500 software and it’s professional level software. So, I’ve had Lightwave for a few months now.

Archibald’s health broke down in his early sixties, and the couple returned to England, where he died in 1908, at the age of seventy. Alicia lived on until 1926, editing her husband’s previously unpublished works, and continuing to write herself.

Our own little one wanted to join them. As soon as the singing began, she started her own little croon. And the acoustics in there are just as amazing for the congregation as they are for the choir.

Father, thank You for this reminder, and for making it clear what I’m to share in Sunday’s message. You indeed work all things together for good! Thank You for the recent lessons in patience, trust, and gratitude. Help me continue to apply what You are so faithful to teach me, not only for myself but also for the benefit of all around me. Your grace and blessings are indeed amazing, limitless, and I so often lose sight of that. Help me keep it in focus so that I may be an unpolluted channel for You to flow through to others, for their salvation and Your glory. Thank You. Hallelujah!

The assassination is an historical event I can look at without a hint of the baby boomer sentimentality which demands a massive conspiracy be behind the killing of JFK because it just shatters people’s world that a lone nut can end the life of the leader of the free world. I am definitely of the lone gunman school of thought and frankly do not find that particularly interesting, either.
Rather than risk the entire scouting mission, the group pressed on the remaining 10% of the way to a tall upthrust which towered over the wetlands jungle and grassland. From this tower of rock several spires jutted out well into the low cloud cover, and appeared to be part of the weapon-system of the place. A too-near approach by a PC pilot resulted in said craft losing a good portion of its starboard wing, and forcing it down. The PCs managed to get the downed pilot strapped onto another craft and then flew to the rim of the upthrust, which itself held untold depths of clear water some way down out of which the spires arose.

I wonder how many families and communities have been torn asunder because a Ray-Ray decided to do some foul shit, and then expected folks to just let him cook. His daddy aint around; he don’t get enough attention at home; a motherfucker looked at him funny; a girl broke his lil heart; he lost the last fight. Whatever the excuse, in Ray-Ray’s mind, it entitles him to pillage and terrorize. And everybody else should just deal – in silence – until he feels satisfied. To whom are we loyal in this case? How did we all end up in a ride or die relationship with Ray-Ray? And is there some sort of waiver of responsibility? Because if I know Ray-Ray’s raggedy whereabouts, I’m tellin’. I don’t really do fear and intimidation. And I’m averse to setting precedents for accepting ridiculous behavior.

The theatre is two short blocks from our house, so we walked. When the play was over at 9:30PM we decided to stop and pick up some coffee and to go and walk to the park at the lake which is 3 long blocks from the theater. So we sat on a bench over looking the water under a street lamp in the cool night air. We didn’t say very much, we just sat and looked at the water reflecting the lights of the houses on the other side of the lake. The surface of the lake was inky black and quiet, very similar to my thoughts. A mating pair of geese were floating in the water in front us. I wondered what troubles they shared. Maybe they were planning their nest and worrying about the outrages that their young ones that would be facing in the cruel world.

As with European empires in the past, the modern Western imperial countries have relied on retrograde religious parties and leaders to collaborate and serve their economic and military interests and to provide mercenaries for imperial armies to savage any anti-imperialist social revolutionaries. In that sense US and European rulers are neither ‘pro nor anti’ Islam, it all depends on their national and class position. Islamists who collaborate with Empire are “moderate” allies and if they attack an anti-imperialist regime, they become ‘freedom fighters’. On the other hand, they become “terrorists” or “fundamentalists” when they oppose imperial occupation, pillage or colonial settlements.

I'm tired. Not sleepy tired. Not tired as in I worked long and hard today - even though I did. I'm wandering in the desert for 40 years tired.

After discussing what was going on with my back Jamie told me I could get undressed and get onto the bed and under the blanket. She disappeared out of the room to give me some privacy. That was when I started to have that age old debate with the other woman inside my head. "Am I supposed to be completely naked"? The sane part of me said "yes" and the insane part of me said "no I can just take my bra off and leave my pants on", (not trousers for you Americans). This debate with myself went on for far too long and all of a sudden I could hear Jaime coming back. I jumped under those covers as fast as a 6 month pregnant woman could and pretended I had been lying there for ever - with my underwear on. Seriously what was I thinking? I have to say that first massage was just OK partly because it took me at least half an hour to relax and anytime her hands got near my sciatic nerve I was pretty much jumping off the table.

One thing that always worries me when someone says they have written a 'children's story' is that this is such a 'catch all' that it tells me almost nothing. The first question that comes to mind is who is this story for? Children require different books at different ages and the books they want are quite different in concept. For example -

Nurses came in to check on both her and I every 15 minutes. At some point they explained the schedule to me, and I don't remember exactly, but it was something like every 15 minutes for the first hour, every half hour for the second, and every hour for a few hours (two? four? ten? I don't remember). Eventually it was just three times a day by the time we left, but it seemed non-stop the first day or so. They also gave her a third glucose check, which she FINALLY passed. She still had to pass two more, though, before they'd consider her in the clear.

Ally wants to be taken seriously but the type of law she practices is flooded with people trying to scam the system.

To make matters even worse, All American Insurance Company is headquartered in the city where Ally works.

Last week sometime Jack and I went out for our occasional Marshall's/TJ Maxx/Home Goods shopping excursion to see what kind of goodies we could find (at discounted prices of course). I was happy to come home with a new pair of jeans that are super long which is a rare find for me, and a couple decorative items for his soon to be transformed bedroom. But the one thing I didn't come home with, I've been thinking about ever since.
I'm not quite sure how to begin describing it. The premise is good, but not good enough to carry me through the truly awful narrative. The writing felt rushed, the characters poorly thought out, and the plotting a total cliche. The dialogue, especially, was unnatural and contrived. "We thought you were working on the Cure--" or dozens of other examples, are not natural dialogue. She cuts it off AFTER the person has said what they were trying to say! Sorry, but that is one of my biggest pet peeves, and after 223 pages of it, I was very fed up.
Hopefully, I'll wake up tomorrow with tons of energy and move right past this little glitch.

Another powerful technique is to create a collage of yourself with your goals, as if they were already completed. If one of your goals is to own a new red car, take a picture of yourself sitting behind the wheel of that red car at your local dealership. If your goal is to visit Egypt, find a picture or poster of the great pyramids and cut out a picture of yourself and place it into the picture. With today’s technology, you can cut and paste yourself into a scanned picture to make an even more convincing image using your computer. Some of your goals may have the result of a desired condition, such as inner peace, rather than a tangible thing such as a car. Find a picture from a magazine or a word that elicits that feeling for you like a person in a chair facing the setting sun.
Big selling point here is also the fact that the doll is cheep. So I have no worry of messing up.

Only 3 months into this blogging challenge and the recipes have already made me rethink my prejudice towards salads. I’ve never been a fan of salad, being forced to eat bland salad as child which consisted of soggy lettuce, cucumber (which I hate) and raw tomatoes (which I also hate) has left me with a dislike for them that until very very recently seemed like it would be impossible to ever change. Well hell hath frozen over it would seem! The sticky chicken and mango salad had started to win me round to the way of the salad and after the salad I made the other day, I am now truly a convert. But only if the ingredients are fresh and zingy with plenty of flavour otherwise it may as well be the soggy salad of my childhood. I cooked this recipe a few days ago, and it’s American-style seared chicken salad from Ainsleys Friends and Family Cookbook and is a variation on the classic Caesar salad. I know you may be thinking “Ainsley Harriott, really?” but do not judge his cookery skills on the fact that he may be the cheesiest chef, nay, man on television. The recipes in this book are really very good and cover a wide scope of good home cooked meals and everything I’ve cooked from it has been lovely. My aunty had this cookbook and after flicking through it last year I decided I needed a copy too, otherwise had I not seen it I too would never have thought about an Ainsley book.

Not even so much as a rumor of a swarm so far for the swarm trap experiment. I still haven't completed a full hive inspection because I am afraid of destroying a queen cup and causing too much of a set back for the build up. My first swarm (that I noticed anyway) last year was on April 21st so it may still be a bit early. I have read a theory that bees build up and swarm more by hours of sunlight than temperatures alone. So far though everything else appears to be about two weeks to a month ahead of the normal schedule but not the bee swarms it seems.
It took a few nights to complete, but it was worth it (as long as it doesn't get destroyed by the rain!)
Welcome! This blog post is dedicated to the Fujipet (フジペット) camera, made by Fuji Photo Film Co. from 1957 to 1963. I will mainly be covering the 120 style Fujipet (also nicknamed Thunderbird in Japan) here, but I will try to offer information about other models as I can. The Fujipet is considered a "toy camera." It isn't built like a toy camera, as the body is made of plastic and aluminum and is quite sturdy, but most of these cameras sport a plastic lens. It was intended as a starter camera for young people, easy enough that even "women and children" could use it.
There's a few titles here that are listed on IMDb as being released in 2011, but I doubt they've been seen by many outside of festival screenings.
Nothing here is terribly brilliant writing-, directing- or cinematography-wise, the most engaging performances are actually provided by the supporting cast--if this wasn't the case, perhaps I would have felt more for the main characters than I did--and the ending will only work for you if you were able to follow the movie from a grounded world to one of criminal masterminds and super spies. Otherwise, you will probably have something of a sour taste in your mouth as the end credits start to roll, and you will find yourself wondering if anyone knew what point they were trying to make with this movie.
Mr P. went off to a conference in Belgium, so I spent most of the night listening for sounds, creaking etc in our old house... Funny, when he is home, I sleep like the Grateful Dead, even if he has been called out...but let him not be coming home, and I suddenly turn into an insomniac. At 1am, I heard a funny rustling sound in the kitchen, froze for a few seconds (duvet clutched high to my neck...as if this was going to save me from whatever was lurking in the house...I mean get real, what?, am I still 2 years old.....), seriously gathered my courage, and leapt out of bed, de-activated the alarm, (I may have grabbed some implement to use as a weapon...the details are kind of fuzzzy), and flung myself headlong into the kitchen....only to be met by silence......

I adore this author! I hope she writes more, and SOON! The Ugly Princess and the Wise Fool is an absolutely hilarious fractured fairy tale. Margaret Gray pokes fun at all kinds of fairy tale stereotypes and common occurrences in a way that is just laugh out loud funny. What I also really appreciated is that, while she is poking fun at fairy tale conventions, she isn't doing it with malice. Instead, all of her fun is good-natured ribbing.
Underlying many of the problems I listed above has been a shift in the way that we view politics. Part of the reason why we haven't had much of an opposition in the last decade is that the Labour Party has been so good at purposefully misrepresenting its opponents and at winning the public relations battle. However you view Conservative policy, reciting the line that the Tories are just the party for the rich does not constitute political debate. (In the same way that repeatedly calling the EDL ‘Nazis’ completely prevents the actual issues from being discussed.)

In my last post I commented on the trend towards the familiar, and so this might seem like a contradiction, but it's not. We get bored easily, but we don't want real change, we're not interested in real literary development, and in the age of the cult of youth and personality we are frankly frightened of the kind of change that overtakes dewy young faces as the years go by. We want a new brand of the same product: tales of youth adorned with pics of authors with sulky pouts and slides in their hair and little-girl cardigans. (Apologies to Gwendoline Riley, but then I never said I wasn't a bitch; now there's an author who managed to publish a very short novel - see 'Odds and Ends' in the Art of Fiction - and I suspect it wasn't simply on the strength of her prose, good as it is.)
This is similar to the Stoic notion of Nature, which for them was not only order, but the force which creates all, which for them was not only the embodiment of logos, but also the sacred fire which provided energy for all. This helps us get a sense of why the good is not, for these thinkers, something otherworldly, but rather, the best of what is wordly, that which created it, and pushes it forward, that which gives us life in the first place, even as it leads to its possibility for bettering. Reason, or Nature, wasn’t merely the all, but the pull within the all towards the best it could be, a pull which was stronger in some aspects of the world than others. For Stoics, our duty is to come into sync with this, and happiness would result. For the Epicureans, we should aim for happiness, but this will only come about when we understand our place in the whole.
A rather plot-less trip through period costumes, beautiful locations, wonderful singing, and interesting conversations is almost ruined by a severely below standard film print. A disappointing release for a catalog title in 2011, with a presentation in such bad shape that I’ve seen Public Domain DVDs from Wal-Mart with better masters. While too slow for children, it would provide interest for Classical music lovers and Walt-era fans, if they can stand the look of a worn VHS. Still, as this most likely will be the last time we see this film released on a physical format, fans of the film may want to pick it up. However, at $19.99, you might want to wait for the price to lower a few dollars or get this second hand.
Wow have the last couple of weeks been stressful. I've been working a minimum of 16 hours per day (usually closer to 18) for a couple of weeks, and suffering from fatigue-induced vertigo. Which was actually kind of cool!
"One of our problems may be that decline is so slow and imperceptible that we don’t really see it coming clearly enough. I have seen large companies perfectly and impeccably manage themselves into failure. Every step along the road has been well done. Every account is neatly signed off... I sometimes feel the Church is a bit like that. I wish that all of us would have a sense of real crisis about this."

After 55 days, the FBI has captured one of the nation’s most wanted criminals.
I just read Game Informer’s big feature over Halo 4,and it had so many new details. There are so many things to talk about i’ll break it down to be easily digestible for everyone. To start off, Halo 4 will be a direct predecessor to Halo 3 and will be a tie-in. The story line will start off with Forward unto dawn’s split ship and it’s explosive journey across the universe. So the new Halo trilogy will focus on the reclaimer saga. This should be an interesting entry into the Halo universe. Cortana is nearing her 7 year AI lifespan, so we as the players will unravel the mystery that surrounds Cortana’s lifespan and the return of Master Chief. The beginning level marks the return of the covenant as enemies as well. So from the article we can detail that there will be a prologue and we will see Chief’s remarkable return to the little screen (or big for all you large hdtv owners). Further into the article, we learn of a new enemy, no details other than the fact that they are not covenant or flood, but a new race with new weapons and classes. Not leading into any more details 343 industries, detailed the new multiplayer titled “Infinity”. Infinity will tie in directly to Halo 4′s campaign, and will serve as the only way to experience new and classic Halo multiplayer. It has been confirmed that there will be no firefight mode included in Halo 4, so that may be a negative aspect to some. Infinity will follow the continued evolution of the spartan project, and will introduce us to the new Spartan IV, which are equipped with a new form of Mjolnir armor. Halo 4′s multiplayer will take an approach closer to Call of Duty’s. You will first start of as a recruit and will have to rank up and unlock and earn new abilities. The new abilities can be game changing, and alter the character dramatically. When a player earns a new rank they will earn what is called spartan points. These points will allow you to earn new unlocks that range from new armor, to new abilities, and items which can be utilized in a load out. That will be an interesting addition to the classic gameplay and it could either improve MLG gameplay or hinder. 343 does confirm the return of classic weapons which include, the battle rifle, assault rifle, DMR, the assault carbine, magnum and plasma pistol. 343 did not disclose new weapons, although they did say that there are many game changing unrevealed weapons that will be included in the arsenal of weapons. To go more into detail with the multiplayer there will be a revamped post game reward system. In the new system players will be rewarded with medals, spartan points, as well as rewards for in game actions done such as assists, revenge kills, and even distractions. Apart from the expansive multiplayer mode there will be an entirely new multiplayer co-op mode called Spartan Ops. While it may seem as it may be similar to Call of Duty’s spec ops, it is far from it. 343 details that it will be an episodic evolving campaign which will explain the story of red vs. blue. Up to four players can join together to complete an episode each week, which will include a cg sequence. The experience is noted to be that of a tv structure except you are in direct control of what happens next. 343 promises that it will not be paid DLC but will be a central part of Halo 4′s purchasing point. So there shouldn’t be any worries fellow gamers, you will not, I repeat not have to purchase any episodic DLC for Halo 4. The episodic content will span out in several months worth of content, which is meant to keep players engaged and will raise the replay value of the game.
But, with this beer being grabbed straight off the production line, they sent the thing through naked.
In 2003 Kristen Jane Anderson was asked to share the story of her transformation with the high school youth group in her church. More speaking requests soon followed. In response to the many reaching out to Kristen who were struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts, Kristen started Reaching You Ministries in December of 2004. Quickly, Reaching You grew beyond Kristen's wildest dreams. God opened doors for us to reach and help thousands with the love, hope, healing, and leadership of Christ through Kristen's story. With the publication of her book “Life, In Spite Of Me” in May of 2010, Kristen is praying that Reaching You's impact will be bigger than ever before, that lives would be saved, and that God's goodness would be made known to many.

The realization brought up memories, both sad and happy. Sad, obviously, because of how the relationship and the marriage ended. In hindsight, I realize that I went into it hopelessly innocent and naive. It was my first real relationship, and I see now that I was trying to follow in my parents' footsteps...young, full of high hopes and good intentions, and blissfully unaware of the rough road ahead. But while I'm sad about how it ended, I've long since stopped beating myself up - maybe I didn't always handle things as skillfully as I could have, but I tried my honest best.
Furthermore, the NJFRC would just become another little nest of political patronage.
After that I met up with a couple other friends and we went ice skating at Campus Martius in the heart of downtown Detroit, which is something I've been wanting to do for a long time. It was as fun as I'd imagined except there were a million kids, and they were playing tag (on the ice, in ice skates), and they weren't that awesome at ice skating. Needless to say, it's amazing they all left without severed limbs.
I have such a mental block about this necklace right now - I don't want to take it apart, but it isn't working the way it is now, and it never will. Once I accepted this, the decision was so clear. Doesn't make the decision any easier, but it has to be done. I think the fringing will go SO much easier once I can start fresh!

"Carol, are you sure he was dead?"
I was only one shot and one scene into a night of drinking and horror movies with Jimmy when the call came in. It was my mother in tears, delivering the bad news that she had received from my sister who had in turn received it from our step-family. The details were sketchy, only that my father was dead, that he had killed himself and life would never be the same again.
Now this is not Gospel it varies according to the whims of the Gods.

“It’s fuckin’ April, you stupid fuck!”
THE FIRST TIME I CALLED MISTER ROGERS on the telephone, I woke him up from his nap. He takes a nap every day in the late afternoon–just as he wakes up every morning at five-thirty to read and study and write and pray for the legions who have requested his prayers; just as he goes to bed at nine-thirty at night and sleeps eight hours without interruption. On this afternoon, the end of a hot, yellow day in New York City, he was very tired, and when I asked if I could go to his apartment and see him, he paused for a moment and said shyly, “Well, Tom, I’m in my bathrobe, if you don’t mind.” I told him I didn’t mind, and when, five minutes later, I took the elevator to his floor, well, sure enough, there was Mister Rogers, silver-haired, standing in the golden door at the end of the hallway and wearing eyeglasses and suede moccasins with rawhide laces and a flimsy old blue-and-yellow bathrobe that revealed whatever part of his skinny white calves his dark-blue dress socks didn’t hide. “Welcome, Tom,” he said with a slight bow, and bade me follow him inside, where he lay down–no, stretched out, as though he had known me all his life–on a couch upholstered with gold velveteen; He rested his head on a small pillow and kept his eyes closed while he explained that he had bought the apartment thirty years before for $11,000 and kept it for whenever he came to New York on business for the Neighborhood. I sat in an old armchair and looked around. The place was drab and dim, with the smell of stalled air and a stain of daguerreotype sunlight on its closed, slatted blinds, and Mister Rogers looked so at home in its gloomy familiarity that I thought he was going to fall back asleep when suddenly the phone rang, startling him. “Oh, hello, my dear,” he said when he picked it up, and then he said that he had a visitor, someone who wanted to learn more about the Neighborhood. “Would you like to speak to him?” he asked, and then handed me the phone: “It’s Joanne,” he said. I took the phone and spoke to a woman–his wife, the mother of his two sons–whose voice was hearty and almost whooping in its forthrightness and who spoke to me as though she had known me for a long time and was making the effort to keep up the acquaintance. When I handed him back the phone, he said, “Bye, my dear,” and hung up and curled on the couch like a cat, with his bare calves swirled underneath him and one of his hands gripping his ankle, so that he looked as languorous as an odalisque. There was an energy to him, however, a fearlessness, an unashamed insistence on intimacy; and though I tried to ask him questions about himself, he always turned the questions back on me, and when I finally got him to talk about the puppets that were the comfort of his lonely boyhood, he looked at me, his gray-blue eyes at once mild and steady; and asked, “What about you, Tom? Did you have any special friends growing up?”
The film pitches the viewer straight into the action as it opens during the raid on the Northfield bank. After the dramatic escape of Jesse (Robert Wagner) and brother Frank (Jeffrey Hunter) the film proceeds to narrate events via a series of flashbacks which lead up to the climactic and doomed heist. The True Story of Jesse James, as I said, manages to correct a few of the errors of the earlier version. In this film the James gang are, more accurately, shown to be driven towards a life of crime as a result of the conditions that prevailed after the Civil War. The treatment of the other characters is also a good deal closer to reality. The 1939 film had the James home being bombed by railroad agents, resulting in the death of Jesse’s mother. Nicholas Ray’s movie has the attack being carried out by Pinkerton men (referred to here as Remington agents) and causing not the death of the old woman but the loss of her arm – again this is pretty much as it happened. It is no bad thing either that the Younger brothers are actually portrayed here, although the emphasis on them is slight.
Around the gardens of her châteaux plump shepherdesses and crinoline gowned milkmaids led sheep and calves with silk bows around their necks across the well kept lawns romanced by handsome young shepherds and farmers dressed in pristine smocks carrying garlands of flowers for the hair of their maidens. Amongst this this scene, and serenaded by flute players, the queen would stroll with her courtiers and young admirers, wearing gowns of the finest silks and muslin styled to appear like peasant clothing.
I am SO excited! So please keep me in your thoughts and prayers tomorrow!

I shudder to think of the monster I created with spinach, banana, and way too much almond milk in my experimenting with vegan baking. It tasted… okay, I suppose. But it was a spongy pudding type of creation that even I couldn’t pass off as a delicious accident.
And it seems that a lot of the ‘newbie’ English are not too happy with being either ‘shunned’ by their French neighbours or they find them too nosy; you know, asking about their former lives, their families, their health, their income – whether they are working and what at, why they are here etc. etc.. Of course they are going to be curious about these strangers who come to live in their country. If the ‘newbies’ don’t like it then they should give as little information as they want and continue to be regarded with ‘Gallic suspicion’.

Jesse was very apprehensive about the whole thing. “I don’t know if I want to.” Jesse said as Paul nudged him toward Casey. “Go for it. It’s fresh!” Billy replied. “Jesse, you act as queer as a three dollar bill.” Michael said. Although fear was getting the best of Jesse, he had no other choice than to follow the leader. “That just dills my pickle. Look at Jesse, he can’t get it up.” Michael commented before he swallowed a couple of pills. “I’m so nervous. I don’t know whether to scratch my watch or wind my butt.” Jesse said as he tried to prepare his unwilling genitals for a line drive. “I don’t want to go to jail.” He added. “Just screw her. You’re thinking too much” Michael demanded. “He couldn’t hit the water if he fell out of a boat.” Paul stated. “We’re all in this together.” Billy added. After a few minutes of self stimulation Jesse proclaimed, “Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit, there he is.” Jesse said as he got an erection. “Casey, remember my name. You’re gonna be screaming it, in just a minute.” “You’re a poster child for birth control Jesse,” Paul said as Jesse began to rape Casey. “If things get any more exciting’, I’ll have to hire someone to help me enjoy this.” Jesse said as struggled to penetrate Casey. Laughing hysterically Billy looked at Paul and said, “If stupidity was an infection, Jesse would cause a major outbreak.”
And while one newspaper sees part of the point, it is not sufficiently adult to realise where the true problem really lies. As we pointed out last year, a crucial part of the scrutiny system - and especially where parliament drops the ball - is the media. Here, the Sunday Telegraph leader does at least acknowledge that: "Our own columnist, Christopher Booker, protested in 2006 at the outrage of British troops in Southern Iraq being sent to meet their deaths in lightly-armoured Snatch Land Rovers, in conditions which also applied in Afghanistan".
The Board therefore affirmed the refusal to register.
So this year, I'm determined to be ambitious, but also realistic. I'm aiming to stay grounded by keeping things in perspective, applauding my accomplishments and not beating myself up for the inevitable failures. Overall, I'm looking forward to good things, great changes and challenges, and a year full of success.

Potato Patties or perkedel kentang is Indonesian mashed potatoes patties. The word perkedel was derrived from Dutch frikadel. Shallots, garlic, candlenuts, nutmeg, white pepper, chopped Chinese celery are added into mashed potatoes mixture, then shaped into patties. These little round patties are then dipped in beaten eggs and deep-fried until golden brown. In East Java, the perkedel patties are usual condiment to a chicken soup (with no coconut milk) whereas in other regions, perkedel will company a special coconut-based chicken soup. Perkedel kentang can be served with nasi kuning (Indonesian yellow rice) as well.

He's not just having trouble with reading, he's struggling with writing as well. Here's an example of the writing he's been doing in class. I'm sure there's an elaborate story here with incredible amounts of detail, because that's the sort of story he tells, but I can't decipher the strings of letters. After a quick scan, I think he's talking about going shopping with me at Target for all the toys he wants for Christmas, but that's a shot in the dark. Mrs. S told me that her heart went out to him on this one! He was working incredibly hard to express himself.
I hope you are all working on fabulous new creations in your lives for the new year. May 2012 see all of your dreams and aspirations come true………………………………….
The soup is thick and gloopy like Lloyd Grossman pasta sauce. It's not very hot which is just as well. I always burn my mouth with too-hot soups.

Really looking forward to Easter so that I can have a good old play! Also won a fiver at Crafty Bob’s stall and got myself a gold bag…that was a nice start to the day!

Finally, the single largest purchase of my entire trip, in terms of value – Su:M 37 Set which came with the Water-full Gel Cream, Water-full Skin Refresher, Water-full Rebalancing Gel Lotion and their highly-raved Secret Programming Essence. For the uninitiated, Su:m37 is a high-end counter fermentation brand. Their star product – the Secret Programming Essence has been compared to SKII’s Facial Treatment Essence, and truth be told, they’re in a similar price range – just to give you an idea.
Mix basil, garlic, and salt and pepper in a food processor and pulse until fine. Add olive oil and keep pulsing until consistency is smooth. Add in cheese and mix (don't add the cheese and then run the processor, it gives a burned flavor to the cheese because of the heat of the blade). There's your pesto!
A member of our church had been involved in the Brownsville Revival. She told me many stories about the revival that happened there & the anointing that she received from there. Whenever she went up for prayer her body would shake & eventually she would, fall to the floor.
So the NYPD are out in force on Franklin--this isn't news. The street patrols have been beefed up to McGwire-Sosa proportions (the lady counted 8 officers in one 8-block trip from Dean to Eastern the other morning), the Mobile Command Center has been in place for over two weeks, the Skywatch has been crowding the sidewalk into one line at St. John's all summer, and the other day I saw mounted police clop-clopping their way up the Avenue. I don't recommend this test, but I'd put decent money down that if you live on Franklin between Eastern and Atlantic and you walked out your door right now and shouted "POLICE!" as loud as you could, you'd have a uniformed officer at your door in less than five minutes.
When it comes to nuts, I love using walnuts for pesto. But again, I didn't have a lot and knew I wanted to save some for muffins. How about cashews? Why not? So I used a combo of walnuts and cashews.

Next up, Juan Manuel Lopez vs Rafael Marquez. I really want Marquez to win, but I don't see it happening. I think Lopez wins, most likely by knock out. I think Marquez has the heart to win, but I don't think he's fast enough to compete with Lopez although he looked GREAT with his new trainer in his last fight with Vasquez.
They should have kept it as a tractor race as well. I mean, people still race tractors in 2011 right? They could have amped up the hardcore level a bit by having the tractors collide and then explode or something. Then KB 2.0 could have walked away from the explosion in slow motion. Just sayin’.
“Jazz,”an emotionally intense poem, enacts a scenario where a 21-year-old musician-daughter asks her mother to “listen to that” jazz. But, more importantly, to listen to her say, “I am pregnant and I am not ready.” The mother is non-judgmental and concerned. Desperate, the daughter asks her mother’s help. “And you knew that I would,” the poet writes. They leave the jazz club and walk home, “parts of one song, one knowing/ remembering, one telling, one listening.” The narrative of this poem is interlaced with imagery from modern art (“Blues like Picasso’s blue figures”) and jazz (“high notes on clarinet, shrieks of the horn”) which help weave the strong emotions into a wider aesthetic tapestry.

I love pore strips, they pull out all the disgusting black heads and oil and icky stuff out of your pores. It’s so cool to look at what it pulls off, I don’t think I know a single girl that won’t admit to checking out the strip after. Hehe. I suppose they probably do damage your skin if you use them too often, they can break the skin and it takes a while to repair. So I personally say do it twice a week but some pore strips are nice enough to your skin to be able to do it three or four times :) just check the packet. You can always sue if they’re wrong :D

In response to that post someone commented, “Brent, if your van is still having problems, then God may just give you the chance to make right your missed opportunity.” This got me thinking, “Yes, but what if the van is fixed for good and I never see this service agent again?” Certainly, I will trust the sovereignty of God to do what he sees fit. But is there more I can do? Wait… that’s right… the service agent gave me his business card before I left the dealership, which means I have his email and the dealership’s address. I don’t have to wonder if I’ll ever get an opportunity to make right my missed opportunity because I can just send him a personal “thank you” card and explain to him the power of the gospel that saved me and can save him.
Suddenly the whole superstructure of the ship appeared to split, well forward to midship, and blow or buckle upwards. The second funnel, large enough for two automobiles to pass through abreast, seemed to be lifted off, emitting a cloud of sparks. It looked as if it would fall on top of me. It missed me by only 20 or 30 feet. The suction of it drew me down and down, struggling and swimming, practically spent.
If we look harder we don't see an 'underclass' living it up on its welfare 'entitlements', we see an 'overclass' living it up on its 'entitlement' to expenses and profits in blind trusts flowing from NACT policies. What is more all of business profits come from the labour of the working class in the first place. This fact never seems to enter into the bosses calculations because to admit it would be to identify themselves are the real bludgers on the nation.

I put tomato sauce, spinach, bacon, onions, and parmesan cheese on top. Overall, not bad. I wasn’t impressed with the first bite but then it grew on me. If I made this again I would definitely follow the directions more closely, use less coconut flour, and maybe just roll out half the dough at a time to get a thinner crispier crust.

Last Thursday was one hell of a day, but we got to the awards for 6.30 having changed in the pub over the road. I have to say I was not at my best. My throat was so sore I could hardly swallow, let alone talk, I felt shattered, and all I really wanted to do was crawl into bed. But I had a glass of wine, made myself talk to some of the other shortlisters and one of the judges, then the awards began.
