Will we reach utilization levels that we're seeing in the fee-for-service program? That now has become an expectation. But it's an expectation that has just been articulated in the past five months. We are already seeing a significant increase in utilization.

First, I asked my friends how they would go about choosing a new dishwasher. We agreed that the responsible and rewarding method would be to ignore any marketing hype and instead follow the Best Buy recommendations by Consumer Reports. Because nobody mentioned the virtues or shortcomings of, say, Whirlpool's executives as a valid criterion for choosing the appliance, I asked why they argue for hours about the perceived personalities of the candidates instead of comparing the track records of the major parties. My friends answered that it's simple enough to summarize the essential properties of dishwashers, while the elections are about a large number of issues that defy easy tabulation. Therefore, they concentrate on the candidates, hoping that by choosing the right person for the job, the elected official will make the right decisions when dealing with all those different issues.

I think we're moving to create a more immersive experience for our resort hotel guests. This strategy is using creativity and innovation to actually continue to exceed the guests' expectation and overall experience and create greater immersion within a resort hotel.

It raises their level of expectation and excitement and therefore we're meeting this need in the guest's mind to stretch the experience for them. And I think it creates good business value for us along the way.

For example, when my mother moved from a townhouse to an apartment, I inherited her garden shovel. It's a nice shovel and we have a big yard, so I kept it.

The guanciale has wonderful flavors of cured pork cheek with tender ricotta and a dusting of fennel powder. But my favorite so far has been the carciofini, topped with ricotta and marinated artichokes. They've got a calzone, a half moon practically big as a leg of lamb, stuffed with burrata and escarole accented with Gaeta olives and capers.

Hard to believe that, three years ago, the Thunder were a 23-win team that changed coaches during the season and finished last (yes, below the Timberwolves) in the division. But the team’s ascent has been quick and impressive—they’ve won 50 games each of the past two seasons and, last year, they took a major step forward by carrying their regular-season success into the playoffs, where they beat the Nuggets and Grizzlies before eventually losing to Dallas in the conference finals.

The ad also implies the bakery faces a 40 percent increase in taxes. Revenue raised by corporate income taxes will indeed rise that much. But most Oregon businesses pay personal income taxes; they would not face an increase anywhere near that magnitude. While the ad dismisses the idea that businesses “only pay $10 in taxes,” most companies subject to the corporate tax do indeed pay just a $10 minimum tax now. Many do pay other kinds of taxes, such as local property taxes.

Advocates of barefoot training swear by it, claiming that ditching their shoes has improved the running experience and solved injury problems. Four months ago, 29-year-old Salt Lake City runner Brett Williams was on the verge of buying the Nike Airmax 360, a $160 shoe. In researching the shoe, he stumbled across www.runningbarefoot.org, which has become the Web-based bible for barefoot runners. "I decided I'd had enough and went barefoot," says Mr. Williams, who on Saturday ran the Salt Lake City marathon, his first marathon, while barefoot. Mr. Williams says he enjoys running more now, and suffered only a minor scrape during the race that was less painful than the blisters that often develop on the feet of shod runners. "Your connection with the ground beneath your feet is absolutely lost with shoes on," says Mr. Williams. "I am utterly convinced your feet don't need support or cushioning. If they do it's because you're not running correctly."

Rats in the study had access to a sugar solution twice a day for two weeks. Then researchers tested their responses to stress by placing them in tubes that restricted their movements. Compared with controls, the rats who had had access to sugar had lower heart rates and levels of stress hormones. Other rats who received a saccharin-sweetened solution also had reduced stress responses, but rats who had sugar delivered directly to their stomachs did not. Researchers inferred that it was the pleasurable taste, not the calories in the solution, that produced the effect.

But every generation needs to find its own outlaws. And by the wild energy of the mostly under-30 crowd -- possibly disconnected from the country pap of the latest Brad-Kenny McPaisney, or the navel-gazing emo-rock of whiny guys with bad haircuts -- it's clear that Eric Church aims to fill those boots for some time to come.

The U.S. Attorney's Office Eastern District of California is also investigating a potential civil action against the building's owner, Alan Wofsy, of San Francisco, Weaver said.
If lots of people are out of work this fall, then Obama is less likely to be re-elected. Conversely, if unemployment fell, then Obama's re-election chances would rise, thereby jeopardizing McConnell's main priority. People tend to blame or credit the president, rather than Congress, for policies and their consequences. I know because I still despise Richard Nixon for drafting me 40 years ago.
When it came to projecting Young's role, Nix offered no guarantees except to say the starting job's already taken by Ryan Fitzpatrick, leaving Young competing for a backup job.

It was after hearing dozens of stories at a 2006 book signing in Bakersfield, Calif., that the mother-daughter team began work on "Rescued Recipes." The D'Atris spent the next three years collecting recipes scribbled in pencil on yellowed note cards, others recited from memory. Although the family stories were clear, the recipes were often fuzzy. A pinch of cinnamon, or handful of basil; knead until ready, bake until done.
The Forest Service proposal to prohibit horizontal drilling and the associated process of hydraulic fracturing in certain parts of the 1.1-million acre forest stretching across Virginia and West Virginia, appears to be the first time that the drilling process would be barred on public lands. The agency's action drew criticism from House Republicans during a hearing Friday.

“From an entity point of view, they can really only focus on this one project right now, which is figuring out who their partner is going to be,” said Lupo.
The neighborhood — the diversity of the neighborhood — may have been what drove me to write about food in the first place. Immediately before the riots there had been restaurants from 14 regions within a few minutes walk from my apartment. Not just the Korean, Mexican and Japanese places you might have expected, but restaurants from Sumatra, Thailand, Guatemala, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Holland, Colombia, Nicaragua, Japan and Peru among others — all coexisting, all more or less delicious.

The President plans to speak about health care reform Wednesday at St. Charles High School in his second trip to a suburban St. Louis high school within the last twelve months.
The truth is that if new diseases erupted the way that "Contagion" and its science advisers suggest, we'd all have died a long time ago. We are too much a single planet; we are 7 billion people practically sitting in each other's laps, as science-fiction writer Robert Heinlein might say. It's fortunate that even if filmmakers forget natural selection and its stringencies, pathogens don't. That's why we are still here to argue about it.
That analysis found that the Reid measure would cut about $840 billion from agency budgets through 2021, roughly the same as the proposal by Boehner. But Reid also claims significant savings from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The CBO found that those savings account for more than $1.1 trillion, making up about half of Reid's debt-reduction package.

To be sure, the United States is still more violent than Europe or Canada, and that's nothing to brag about. But this country is far, far safer than it was as recently as the late 1980s, when the movie "Robocop," set in a future dystopia of rampant urban mayhem, both expressed and exploited the public's belief that criminals ruled the streets -- and always would.
Afterward, the Mets donned cowboy outfits as part of a bonding exercise and boarded a charter flight to Houston, glad to have escaped with two victories in three games here.

Those who speculate say that the most advanced stem cell treatments are still probably a decade away from becoming available to patients. And the cost to get them there will far exceed California's $3 billion investment. The hope was that California's bond would jump-start a biotech industry by building the laboratories and seeding early research to a point where private support would take over.
It's true that many city parks have an off-leash area. Naysayers will point to this as evidence of a good-faith effort to cater to dog owners, but these off-leash areas are simply not sufficient. I live a short walk from the Laurelhurst Park's off-leash area. In winter, this area invariably becomes a muddy mess. It is a few hundred square feet of churned-up earth where dogs can mill about. It's more of a social affair -- for dogs and humans alike -- than a place where pet owners can provide adequate exercise. And I'd have to say that this is the case with most municipal dog parks: They offer a chance for socialization more than daily exercise.
We tried the Chocolate Layer Cake recipe from scratch. It was a bit complicated the first time through, but worth the effort.
A victory in the light welterweight title elimination bout gives Judah a chance to face the winner of title-holder Lamont Peterson and Amir Khan, who fight on May 19. Amid a dwindling career where such chances are few and far between, Judah (42-7, 28 KO) may have bought himself one last shot.

Matt Calkins, The Columbian: When I look at Wesley Matthews, The Undrafted Marquette Guard, I can't help but hear the "Rocky" music. Here is a guy that willed himself onto an NBA team and got paid in a year that none of his contemporaries did when he accepted an offer with the Blazers that the Jazz couldn't match. But when I look at Wesley Matthews, The $6.8 Million Dollar Per Year Guard, I also can't help but hear the O'Jays "For the Love of Money" and think that Portland overpaid.
That was part of the community outreach that police have been pushing in the area bounded by Cactus Road and Olive, Grand, 67th and 83rd avenues - an area they call the "red zone."

The district, which favors Democrats in November, stretches from Toledo to Cleveland. Incumbent Reps. Marcy Kaptur and Dennis Kucinich will face of in the Democratic primary.
4. The feeble attendance by Ohio State fans was baffling. It wasn't that way in Atlanta in 2007, when the Greg Oden-Mike Conley Jr. team reached the championship game. That team was much more consistent than this year's Buckeyes, and Oden was the lovable, wounded bear of a big man with his broken hand. Jared Sullinger never really filled the role of dominant post player, but the expectations were unrealistic because of his size. Still, there is no doubt this year's Buckeyes overachieved.

As far back as July 2009, Republican legislators and some Democrats criticized the signs as wasteful. Sarah Palin, speaking at a Tea Party convention a year ago, claimed that one state alone -- Ohio -- spent $1 million on stimulus signs.

Carrie and Fred Armisen are wigged and costumed as uber-bland local TV news types. though they seem locked in a '70s fashion time warp, their cheerfully inane commentary on the parade is as timely as last Thanksgiving's Macy's parade on NBC. A nice touch: the bleachers flanking their parade broadcast stand are sparsely populated with onlookers who seem just as depressed as the lactose/soy-intolerant parade participants. Actual Portland reference points for the "Pok Pok Players," demonstrating how Thai food can be fatal to peanut and shellfish-allergy sufferers. I like how the piece raises the stakes, leading up to the parade's princess, who's transported in an ambulance because she's allergic to air, water and sun. And it ends just when it should, with the further heightening of Brownstein's newscaster character succumbing to her dextrose allergy and joining the parade. In a Hearse.

The benefits provided by Metrolink are not worth the risk. They are not even worth Metrolink's costs. Data from the Federal Transit Administration show that Metrolink recovers about 45% of its annual operating and maintenance costs from fare revenues, but none of its capital costs.

The study is one of the largest conducted to date and tracked women for roughly 15 years after their first IVF cycle. Its findings appear to contradict those of an even larger Danish study published in 2009, which found no increase in cancer risk among women who had undergone infertility treatment. But the study's design and its long tracking period allow the study to bring some clarity to a relationship between IVF and cancer that has been long feared but inconsistently proven by researchers.

Paterno's family protected him on Saturday. They shielded his dignity by asking for privacy and, later, angrily questioning how anyone could trample the dignity of a dying man by reporting him already dead. And so, when Paterno was at his weakest and unable to protect himself, his family stepped forward and did it for him. I wonder, in these final hours, if Paterno sensed the sad irony that his life became.

Now, we can't forget that this process of immigration and eventual inclusion has often been painful. Each new wave of immigrants has generated fear and resentments towards newcomers, particularly in times of economic upheaval. Our founding was rooted in the notion that America was unique as a place of refuge and freedom for, in Thomas Jefferson's words, "oppressed humanity." But the ink on our Constitution was barely dry when, amidst conflict, Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which placed harsh restrictions of those suspected of having foreign allegiances. A century ago, immigrants from Ireland, Italy, Poland, other European countries were routinely subjected to rank discrimination and ugly stereotypes. Chinese immigrants were held in detention and deported from Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay. They didn't even get to come in.

On the whole, though, what's most striking about the crime decline is how little we know about its precise causes. Take the increase in state incarceration, which peaked at a national total of 1.4 million on Dec. 31, 2008. This phenomenon is probably a source of success in the war on crime -- and its most troubling byproduct. But increased imprisonment cannot explain all, or most, of the decline: Crime rates kept going down the past two years, even as the prison population started to shrink. Crime fell in New York faster than in any other U.S. city over the past two decades -- but New York locked up offenders at a below-average rate, according to Zimring's new book, "The City That Became Safe."

Obama is right to note that even though California and 15 other states have legalized medical marijuana, its trade violates federal law.
