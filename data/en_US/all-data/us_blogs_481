I want to give a shout out to my pal YGRS, from whom a lovely, handmade Christmas Tree Ornament arrived yesterday. Thanks, YGRS, for sending us such a warm holiday surprise!
WHAT CONSULTATION?
Both Abdul Aziz and Wan Ahmad have responded to Saifuddin’s revelation, saying that they may have been registered as members decades ago but have remained inactive.
One of the best biblical, theological explanations on what happens to people who never hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ and very convicting as well (for those that have not studied the implications of universalism). Sermon preached at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminar.
Squawvine is still used as an eye wash. It is also used as a skin wash and to treat colitis.
Jerry Kilgore enjoyed a short major label career just over a decade ago with the top 40 hit ‘Love Trip’ but is probably better known as co-writer of Tracy Byrd’s hit ‘Love Lessons’. His excellent 2007 self-release Loaded & Empty got him some attention, and has now been followed up with another fine record.

Gaining acceptance into graduate school or medical school and achieving a PhD or MD and becoming a psychologist or psychiatrist means jumping through many hoops, all of which require much behavioral and attentional compliance with authorities, even those authorities one lacks respect for. The selection and socialization of mental health professionals tends to breed out many anti-authoritarians. Degrees and credentials are primarily badges of compliance. Those with extended schooling have lived for many years in a world where one routinely conforms to the demands of authorities. Thus for many MDs and PhDs, people different from them who reject this attentional and behavioral compliance appear to be from another world—a diagnosable one.

The pins on the cushion are those that sent by the company and include an assortment of bow pins, a heart shaped one, and small gem stone ones. Some of these are featured in the pictures below. My favourite are the bow pins, which are available in 6 colours, and are so cute!

This card was a bit of a surprise. It's an old, old sketch challenge that I'd always avoided because I didn't like it, and then I used it here and surprised myself with how much I liked the results. So hey, at least I try.
As you would expect I cannot recommend Saving Leonardo highly enough. On a scale of 1-5 stars I would have to give it at least 7. I encourage you in the strongest possible terms to spend time with this very important book. The dividends will be great.
Does anyone know if there are any openings in the editorial department at Tiger Beat? I think I would be really in my element there.

I was perusing the magazine racks at Borders a day ago, an activity totally foreign to me. I don't read magazines, generally speaking, unless they are conveniently located next to a toilet (to the dismay of those waiting). Since the only ones old enough to have a job and purchase magazines in my home are females, the selection usually includes People, Us, Better Homes and Garden's Christmas Cookie Spectacular, and Seventeen. Mixed in the bunch one might find the latest news from Franciscan University (they keep sending me magazines…did I give them money? Impossible - I have no money.), catalogs for home school supplies, and programming notes from the local Catholic radio station. They tend to hang around for three month intervals. I usually re-read them several times.
Once when I asked L about something in her past she hesitated before answering. “How will you see me?” she said. “What will I be in your eyes?” But I wanted to know her, and she wanted to be known.

Until this happened - we were on the 3rd day since finding an egg. Their feed was enhanced - plenty of protein - plenty of oyster shell. You name it - these girls have been spoiled to the point that there is no way in Hell any of them can continue claiming they’re molting any longer.
Second, the pub table. It is too big and high for this room and now that Ruby climbs, it is downright scary! We've taken the leaf out which has helped with the space and makes dinners feel more cozy - in a good way. Plans for a table are in the works (I considered doing a banquette here but I don't think we'll go that route) and I've got some cools chairs to refinish for the room.
What’s the way out? There’s no easy answer. The main return-to-constitutional-rule scenario envisages President Touré being restored to office, then resigning and handing over power to his designated successor, National Assembly speaker Dioncounda Traoré. But the same constitution would then call for elections to be organized within six weeks. With the country effectively cut in two by the rebellion, holding elections will be impossible. A longer-term transition plan will be needed, one not supervised by the junta.
Knatti, the fourth cat with us, loved it! Above you can see him right after he attacked Julle. Me and Knatti got up first while my sis kept the boys from playing on the road so he had time to plan ambushes on the kittens. He's bullied by a few of the cats at home, but out here he felt far from them and was so happy. He ran around, played with the little ones and cuddled with us. Randa (not in the photos) also joined us later and reacted pretty much the same as Knatti.

It cannot even be compared to that of a piano. Not just because of the difference in the mechanical process (the piano striking the string with a hammer, while the clavecimbel plucks the string), it is a completely and utterly incomparable atmosphere and emotion. When this gavotte is played on the piano I find it melancholic and warm, while it sounds vibrant and booming on clavecimbel. Especially this rendition by the talented Blandine Ronnau (1966) proves that Jean-Philippe Rameau was a bit of a rockstar in his days.

He's undeniably very talented - doing the best version of Come Together I've ever heard, including by The Beatles - but it was his humour I especially liked. And the fact that he, um, has no trouble clenching a guitar firmly between his knees for many minutes at a time (see slightly underexposed picture below). He mentioned at one point that he'd been in prison in Mexico and then, when there was a bit of tooth-sucking and muttering about how you shouldn't say that from the front row, he introduced his next song as being about spanking children.
“This was not your typical father and son business. Vincent George Sr. and Vincent George Jr. exploited women, transporting them from Pennsylvania to johns in Midtown Manhattan,” said Raymond W. Kelly, commissioner of the NYPD. “I commend the NYPD’s Vice Enforcement Division, the Manhattan DA’s Office and federal investigators for shutting down both the johns and the Georges.”

Hello and happy Thursday, everyone! Today I have some thoughts on The Hunger Games film that I would like to share.
“Where?” he asked.
When my mom was pregnant, she did not want to know the gender of her child. She wanted it to be a surprise. She prepared a name for a girl and a boy. I asked her what her planned boy name was, and she said “Sumakwel.” Apparently Sumakwel is a very courageous Filipino datu. But come on, Sumakwel? Really? Thank God I’m a girl! Ano ung nickname ko dun Suma? Or God forbid Susu. But let’s go back to Suma. Hmmm…puwede rin para short for “summa cum laude.” Haha. Then again, cum laude lang ako. ;-p

What drives us to fall in love with a book? What makes a book so important to one person but completely passable to another? I don't think there's a good answer, which is what makes that agent response so frustrating to the aspiring author. It's as an ineffable quality as what makes us love a person. Sometimes, to the outside observer, it's something only we can see.
Mortenson’s second book, Stone into Schools, actually written by him and not David Oliver Relin (the inspired journalist and author who wrote Three Cups of Tea with Mortenson’s notes), was more of high tale of adventure and suspense; a much easier read because of its excitement, and just as inspiring as Tea, especially because of it's spotlight on educating girls. While reading Stones into Schools, I found myself gasping in disbelief at some of the crazy tales Mortenson told; my page turning for this second Mortenson tale was more like reading James Frey’s A Million Little Pieces than Three Cups of Tea. I think I read it in 24 hours.

As most people know there are three principal pronunciations of “scone”. There are those who say “scone”; those who say “scone”; and those who say “Scone”. Some people in addition say “scone” – but as this is such a trivial minority I have decided not to collate figures on these individuals. And while there is a minority who say “Scone” – the implications for the general health and well-being of those individuals is such that it is crucial that figures are collated.
I think about time some... well... times. Last Tuesday, I wrapped up my holiday shopping. In less than five minutes from thinking "I should really buy them something because the big day is less than a week away" I had finished placing an order for a piece of electronics, which would be delivered in time for Christmas.
There is something quite disconcerting about driving an unfamiliar car. You see, I borrowed the courtesy car from the garage today cos they had to service and MOT my car and I didn't want to take a day off in order to leave the car at the garage. (point of fact - the car was meant to be done the Friday before last but the garage agreed to let me have the courtesy car today if I waited for the service/MOT because they had someone off sick back then.)

And what of Lily Grace? The little princess of the house is still the princess. She loves to be cuddled, held like a baby, even though she's 4 going on 10. She has taken on a few characteristics that Lia Faith brought to the table, but I think that's to be expected. She's also begun to do a few things that we're not sure are a result of Lia being here or whether she would have done these things anyway. Little things she knows are wrong, but when asked she says "I couldn't not do it!" Most times, she blames Lia if she fears she stepped over the line!

To be fair, is Ambassador Wayne’s plan any better? Isn’t $5 million a drop in the bucket compared to what the U.S. could do to help? Shouldn’t it be more to make up for so many lives lost in the fight over illicit drug markets and transportation routes?
“Again, truth has no place in this inquiry. It is high time we stood up for our right to let unsubstantiated, defamatory myths triumph over objective fact, and we are appalled that our unsustainable version of events has been so savagely oppressed by this investigation.
Her “Ruby Red Stilettos” is comprised of blown glass using hand-made murrine,an Italian term for colored patterns made in a glass cane. The artist reveals the motifs by slicing the cane into cross-sections. Friedrich’s shoes sport red squares scattered across the sides, instep and toe.
While society tends to treat profanity differently than other classes of words, the lexicographer cannot. The goal, remember, is to attempt to concisely and accurately communicate the lexical meaning of a word, and obscene and vulgar words, with all their shades of meaning and many, many, many uses, need the clearest definitions of them all. In fact, when I buy a new dictionary–something that I’m sure you all do on a regular basis, right?–I judge it on two criteria: treatment of the Big 8 and treatment of profanity. A dictionary written for an adult English speaker should cover profanity. (School dictionaries tend not to include profanity because classroom materials tend not to drop f-bombs. This is because I do not write classroom materials.) If I pick up a dictionary and can’t find a single cussword, I begin to wonder what else the editors decided not to include.
Dougherty began developing concepts for the work during a July 2009 visit to BBG, when he selected the Plant Family Collection—the physical and horticultural heart of the Garden—as the site of the future work.

Ho's I hate New Mexico. There is not one redeeming thing about it. The sign coming in to the state says the Land of Enchantment which I've always proclaimed should read the Land of Disenchantment.. Sure it has some mountains for skiing, (go to Colorado it's right up the street) and tons on Indian casinos (which suck too) but besides that. NADA nothing zilch and if I'm not mistaken someone once agreed with me on that. I think it was Miss Ginger.
Becca Normandy—that’s the name on everyone’s lips. The girl whose picture I see everywhere. The girl I can’t compare to. I mean, her going missing is the only reason a spot opened up for me at the academy. And everyone stares at me like it’s my fault.
Fair enough. But every commercial rental outfit knows the price of a unit goes up by $50 per month for each additional adult who signs the lease, and DSS will cut off a tenant who lets another adult move in with them because it’s misuse of Welfare funds. And landlords will report that, too, because the costs associated with illegal tenancy are real and damaging.
That’s the thing about Dragonquest. It’s never about the boss battles…it’s about surprising your ass with an incredibly difficult “normal” battle just paces before or after a major boss battle. The game is ruthless, but absolutely worth it. It’s a game you absolutely will not be able to put down.

“When some incident has shattered the career you’ve mapped out for yourself, a folly, a crime or a misfortune, you mustn’t think you’re down and out. It may be a stroke of luck, and when you look back years later you may say to yourself that you wouldn’t for anything in the world exchange the new life disaster has forced upon you for the dull, humdrum existence you would have led if circumstances hadn’t intervened.”
It truly was that car wreck on the side of the road that you rubberneck to see the bloody body parts strewn across the road.
It was missing an entire bolt/lugnut set. Completely gone. Now, this was a little worrisome to me but then Bryce explained why this was a big deal. Pretty much, by missing one, the entire wheel starts to get shaky....and driving long miles at 60-80 mph it can rattle so much you could easily lose the entire wheel....losing a wheel while driving in a truck that big on the kind of roads we had been driving. Honestly, we likely wouldn't have survived something like that.
In the meantime, Rosdolsky filled his time usefully. He wrote one of the best accounts of Marx’s Capital – “The Making of Marx’s Capital” – utilising Marx’s notes in The Grundrisse. He corrected many of the distortions of Marx’s work, introduced by the Stalinists. For example, he demonstrated, contrary to the claim of Stalinism – but also adopted by many Trotskyists keen to foresee the kind of social crisis needed for a political revolution – that Marx did not have a theory of immiseration for the working class. Out of several hundred references, to wages, in Marx’s work, Rosdolsky said that there was only one that could possibly be interpreted in that way.
I'm not sure steampunk fits into any of them. The only one that resonates with me in "country", because it is the most likely to mix traditional styles and antiques with industrial pieces. I try hard not to go too country here at the Steampunk Home, though, because it missed the decrepit and geeky aspects of steampunk.

Both, growing up in eras of discrimination, fought with their pens for the emancipation of their own people, which they moreover saw as inextricably linked with the emancipation of all people and nations. Both were masters of their respective languages and drew naturally and freely upon the imagery of the Bible that underlay the educated vernacular of the times. Both were controversial in their day, rejected by chauvinists and racists, but eventually lionized by the majority of the population, who perhaps valued their achievement but underestimated their radicalism. (Heine has the unusual distinction of having managed to become an icon for both the nineteenth-century liberal German middle class and Marxist East Germany.) In both cases, attempts to memorialize their careers in the public sphere proved controversial: for Rev. King, making his birthday into a national holiday; for Heine, attempts to name spaces as diverse as the Düsseldorf University and a street in Tel-Aviv in his honor.

I don’t often read new emerging poetry in Hindi because it is not that easily available and there are simply no publications in the market, no journals, that are easily available and promote new talent. And without this visible option, most people of a literary bent of mind prefer to read the older, established poets. There are efforts in India to have authors writing in the vernacular translated into English,but first you must get published in the vernacular…and that too is far from easy. Even if you do you will hardly make any money from it. Never mind, I tell myself, poets rarely make money anywhere in the world…

“Well, dad,” he replies in the matter of fact ways only young kids can, “Indian food does not have the ‘glamour‘ that the other cuisines have. It’s seen as too ‘dull’ and too ‘boring’. Everything is seen as a ‘curry’, so how do you expect anyone to get into this when all you do is cook a ‘bit of this and a bit of that’ with curry powder? Young chefs want something exciting, something cool and something fancy! Indian food does not offer that.”

Victory cannot be won, cannot be even imagined whilst money holds such power, whilst to speak threatens the livelihood of families, communities and indeed nations, certainly cowardice has play, I am as guilty as the next, I toil knowing the taxman laughs at my endeavours, I work long hours for little pay, toiling to pay the expenses of avaricious politicians and to make a home for a veritable army, a herd, a mass entering and changing all forever. Guilty I am, coward, I work to feed my own, to pay bills, to live, to support, yet never prosper, never achieve true freedom and gone to the ground another will simply take my place, take my place until my place, no my gene is gone, what does it matter then, merely a brown face on a labourers body, a different race, different kind, toiling for the few.

Everything went brilliantly until the next day when I triumphantly took the cake into school and then received a message from the birthday girl saying that she wasn’t coming in… Luckily I had put it in a Tupperware container but I was still worried as the Rice Krispie brownies should really be kept in the fridge. I left it in the locker overnight and the next day it was still there and hadn’t melted, but the (by now pretty annoying) birthday girl still wasn’t there, another day went by and in the end we decided to eat the cake and drink the fake champagne before they spoilt. Needless to say that my friend wasn’t very happy when she found out but hey, she shouldn’t’ have skipped school!
As an Ante/Postnatal Fitness Expert, I prefer new mums to return to an exercise class that is designed specifically for them, so this would be point number one. Several postural changes occur in the body during pregnancy, and it’s important that postnatal women target muscles that have weakened and lengthened to help strengthen, re-align and shorten them back to their optimum position again.

15Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, 16making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. 17Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is. 18Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit. 19Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord, 20always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds," riposted Brodsky, never at a loss for words. "The answer is, right now, I'm wrestling with a series of emergencies and the fact of the matter is that the Hudson Yards deal does not represent a thought-out economic development strategy or priority for what the city and the region need. In defense of that, we're scrambling for ways of gaining some control. It's not necessarily intellectually consistent."
It’s no April Fool’s joke — last month CNN delivered its lowest-rated month in total day in over a decade, since August 2001, the month before the September 11 attacks. The once-dominant cable news network posted decade-lows among both total viewers (357,000) and Adults 25-54 (108,000). Versus April last year, CNN was down 21% in total viewers and 29% in 25-54. In comparison, leader Fox News CHannel was up 2% in total viewers (1.1 million) and 1% in 25-54 (273,000) and No.2 MSNBC was flat in total viewers (425,000) and down 5% in 25-54 (139,000).

Of course there are some who do not want to rock the boat –they have a roof over their heads, a nice car to drive around, three square meals a day and a comfortable job.

So the run went pretty well. Only went 4 miles, but still not bad for someone who hasn't done much physical activity in a while. It was quite tiring but oh well I guess I'll deal with it.

So…is their faith described here because of who they think Jesus is or because of the magic trick they just saw? Are they in this for the miracles or their relationship with God? Do they really understand who they are talking to? I would really like to go back in time and sit down with John for a few hours and ask him some questions about that phrase. Certainly the first part of the sentence is true. The miracle at Cana revealed his glory. Who but God could change water to wine? But the second part of the sentence? It certainly isn’t the same kind of faith they had a few years later after Pentecost.
Colville looked absently at the cards. “The fact is,” he said, to the little bowing, smiling man; “I don’t know but I shall be obliged to postpone my going till Monday.” He smiled too, trying to give the fact a jocose effect, and added, “I find myself out of money, and I’ve no means of paying your bill till I can see my bankers.”

In order to figure out whether selfishness leads to wealth (rather than vice versa), Piff and his colleagues ran a study where they manipulated people’s class feelings. The researchers asked participants to spend a few minutes comparing themselves either to people better off or worse off than themselves financially. Afterwards, participants were shown a jar of candy and told that they could take home as much as they wanted. They were also told that the leftover candy would be given to children in a nearby laboratory. Those participants who had spent time thinking about how much better off they were compared to others ended up taking significantly more candy for themselves–leaving less behind for the children.
By using the unique perspective of the main character Barry Lyga has provided a refreshing twist in what is often a tired genre and even though I did manage to guess most of the ending, that didn’t make it any less enjoyable.
The problem is - if you never expose readers to new books, they'll never know they exists, and then yes, they won't buy them. So it's a self-fulfilling prophesy.
Here are samples of the places we have taken our lunch breaks.
One of the curses of being a woman. She should have let him die when he had that heart attack. That could have been her escape to freedom if she didn’t care so much. Jesus lying on the bed in misery is every battered womans fantasy. It read like a movie scene from a Tyler Perry Movie, yet, Fabiana didn’t take the help from God and let sleeping dogs lie. She was a better person for it, but it cost her her life.
Since supplicants and subordinates are always hypersensitive to the feelings of their superiors, a lack of sensitivity is always interpreted as dominance by men and women alike. In practical terms, this means a lack of reaction to what other people are saying. The more emotionally intense the stimulus, the more important it is to remain calm and impassive. Now, some people come by this naturally. For whatever reason, in a highly charged situation like an emergency or a competitive sporting event, I tend to feel almost as if I go out of my body and I remain much more calm than I would if the situation was an everyday one. Because that has tended to work out well for me, I try to simulate the feeling when it doesn't come naturally.

I’ll explain that another time but this post is about followers.
From a standpoint of reaching out to parents, then, Brodhead has every reason to concede that mistakes were made last spring—not to seek scapegoats, to challenge tenure, or to fire people, as was done to former lacrosse coach Mike Pressler. But to reassure prospective Duke parents that the administration is taking positive steps to ensure that every arts and sciences professor at Duke treats every student at the institution fairly.
The piéce de résistance of my search for early eighties authenticity was dragging the tirelessly good-humoured Belgian Waffling down to the beach in a howling gale so we could enact the time-honoured British Tea Ceremony, Holiday Edition. I think we managed one cup each from the outsize thermos and a scone, crunchy with wind-whipped sand, before the charm wore off, but it evoked the requisite nostalgie de la boue. The only way we could possibly have trumped the experience would have been to drink the tea in the car whilst watching the sea and the lashing rain. But I think you have to be in Filey for it to work properly. I spent several summers as a child on the North East coast, and apparently I used to go swimming quite happily - God knows how I avoided hypothermia.
My father and our uncle would take my brothers and me fishing many weekends when we where young. My uncle would load up his metal Jax ice chest with cold beer and pop, and then put it and a paper sack full of Vienna sausages, potted meat and Evangeline Maid bread in a light blue wooden bass boat. We would trailer it to nearby Henderson and spend a day on the water. We would stay whether the fish were biting or not, heading home only after the adults’ beer was gone.
The story is set many years into the future, after some vaguely specified apocalypse has virtually destroyed the USA. The country has been rebuilt as Panem, split into Districts, and ruled over by the tyrannical Capitol. Poverty exists everywhere else, stealing punishable by death which may be preferable to the slower death by starvation one otherwise faces. The highlight of the year is called The Hunger Games. Once a year, twenty four teenagers - a boy and a girl from each District - are entered into a reality TV show - a survival show. Literally. The show is a fight to the death, the winner being the last survivor. Contestants may opt-in, but not out. If you are chosen, there is nothing you can do but go through with the horrific ordeal. Our heroine, Katniss Everdeen volunteers for the contest to save her beloved little sister from having to take part and no doubt be horribly slaughtered.
Unfortunately, no swingers are murdered with cookware, but the bank employee who denies the Falcone brothers of their lone is played by the writer and director of Twin Sitters, John Paragon, who played the sex shop salesman in–you guessed it–Eating Raoul. And Mother Love actually does strike two ninjas in the head with a frying pan during a heated battle in the kitchen. Sure, they weren't swingers, but it's pretty damn close, if you ask me.
The number of cyberattacks globally spiked significantly last year, and more and more attackers have targeted smaller organizations as well as large ones, reported cybersecurity firm Symantec Corp. recently.
I’ve been hesitant to blog about this until I knew for sure that it was really going to happen. Well, due to matters that I will not disclose on this blog, sifu is taking an extended hiatus from kung fu and chin na. This has been developing since about January and the quality of the instruction has definitely suffered. There is some talk of senior students trying to carry on. In fact, that’s been going on for several months and it’s really not the same. I stuck it out as long as could; however, as of May 1, 2010 I decided to resign from my kung fu school.

Flash back – June 2010 – a colleague of mine (only about two years older than I) was leaving his position at Old Dominion University (ODU) for a one-way ticket to the World Cup in South Africa, and then to see the world shortly thereafter. It must be nice to walk away from full-time employment and all of its securities to go find yourself.
So it's time to come up with a new plan for the next couple of weeks. I still think this is an IT Band issue so I'm going to keep up with the foam roller. I'll also focus more on strength training, yoga and cross training and with a little luck I'll be up and running in plenty of time to get back on track with my Half Marathon training - you know, the one I'm going to run in 1:55.

My point is that, even if the Prince did these things or not, it is now out in the public. Even if Jonas did cheat or not, it is still out in the public, and the public point of view seems to matter a grate deal to royalties as royal decisions are often made to keep the myth of the ideal portrait in harmony. -Which I find tricky, as the ideal of royalty is also quite a myth.

Strength: Explosive. That’s how I would describe the Missouri Tigers. They can score in a multitude of ways, but mostly using their outstanding guards. Marcus Denmon, Michael Dixon, Phil Pressey and Kim English are outstanding three-point shooters and their offense is geared towards that. Missouri, who is No. 1 in the Big XII in scoring, is a legit national championship contender and the way it can fill it up is why.

I don't know that any of my ramblings will even help anyone, other than help me get it all out there. Even if no one reads this thing but me. :) I guess I just needed to say it out loud. It's hard right now...ALL my friends and family are long-distance. That stinks when you work full-time and all your friends are stay at home mommys. Not only do I no longer feel connected to that life, but by the time I think about calling, it's 10 pm. I email all day long now at work...to email my friends just feels cold and impersonable. Facebook is an old friend I like to visit for 10 minutes a day. If I don't comment on your page, nothing personal, there's just no time.
It's also very important to ease off a bit because now I'm going to be asking him to use his muscles in a different way and I know he's going to be a little ouchy while he figures some things out. So, things started out a bit ugly. We talked about side reins, and how proper contact should act like them: the contact is comfortable when he gives to the pressure, arches his neck and raises his back.
Then Chihungwa, Mutandagawi and Zambu went to call Chinamaringa, Chidziva and Nzvere to come and live with them at Chishawasha. When Chiweshe heard that, he said, “I am very sorry because these sons of Mhembere have been helping me in ruling my country.” Finally he agreed and he gave three cattle to each of them and they went to Chishawasha. When they reached Chishawasha they did not live where there were other people but near a hill called Chishawasha. After a short time Chinamaringa, Chidziva and Nzvere saw that Nyamare was not ruling his people and country well.

Fewer than half think themselves Muslims first and Americans second, compared to 81 per cent in Britain. Yet America is, by any measurable standards, far more “Islamophobic” than Britain, with far more public criticism and mockery of that religion.

How do you categorize this year as good or bad? How do you say, "2011 was a great year" without also saying, "2011 really knocked me down emotionally?" I don't think I can do it. For what I thought would be one of the best years of my life, I have to end it with a big question mark. I don't know if I'm happy to be shutting this chapter of my life, this year of good times and so many memories. And I don't know if I'm happy that a new year is here and I can start over. This year has left me feeling uncertain about a lot of things.

And so, back to Harrogate again to interview Laurie Graham and Wendy Holden about At Sea and Marrying Up respectively. The discussion ranged widely from why we're all fed up of Pippa Middleton, the joy of writing about wicked characters, feminism with large and small fs, Carmen Callil (who discovered Graham) and comic influences. It was great fun.

The Benefits: Red Lake Diatomaceous Earth is meant to be mixed in livestock feed as an anti-caking agent and flow aid. What this means is that the product prevents grain and feed from clumping together, as well as helping to lubricate feed materials being compressed into pellets. However, many University studies, as well as individuals using the product in the field, have found that the addition of Red Lake Earth to chicken feed may also provide additional benefits including increased body weight, egg production and egg quality as well as decreased internal parasites (in poultry with a lower natural resistance).

I went out to move my car from the far parking lot to the closer one at 4:00, and what would normally be a 10-minute errand took me half an hour. On my way back into my building, I slipped twice on what looked like perfectly fine walkway. That scared me. When I e-mailed students to ask about how things looked on their side of campus, I kept getting reports of people falling. And this was *after* the university buildings & grounds staff had already been working all day on clearing & salting the walkways. So I relented, canceling class and heading home a little after 5.

“You’ve never had sex before?” She sounded really surprised and I was actually a little offended. So?

These girls were as young as 14. My being 23 and never experiencing intercourse was kind of like a dog seeing a rainbow.

Mark has been away, and I refuse to listen to his replacements, the irritating and irritatingly named Floyd and Boyd, one of whom, and who fucking cares which one, started life as the film critic for Heat magazine. And so it is that I have not heard a review of 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes'. Which would be of little note had Common Law not brought home a doovd containing said movie burnt by one of her many admirers in work. And so, needing a little sabbatical from The West Wing and lacking My Double Blind Kermodian Buffer, I sat to down to watch it.
Now, it's not all pie in the sky. I know that. Reality comes in and I do have to guide them. We have to make choices that will last for a while. At my children's ages, neon orange walls probably do not have staying power. Maybe I help them work the neon in some other way. We need to try to avoid scenarios where someone totally dislikes their choices a year later. And, since all of our children share rooms with one another, I need to mediate between what often prove to be two very different visions for a single bedroom. I also need to be a good steward of our time, money, and other resources while I'm attempting to steward the children's plans and ideas. It has not been easy to try to hit this balance so far. But, I feel like I'm learning so much from the process.

Well, I’m a little nervous as I think about she’ll react when I tell her she’s getting one, but I don’t let on. To be truthful, as we get started, it puts me in a good mood because I like spanking her. I find that any anger I had usually goes away very quickly when she makes herself vulnerable by putting herself over my lap. As I spank, I am claiming again that role of HOH and I remember that I am responsible for her and I’m to take care of her. And I love her.

The one about giving him what he wants, and not what he doesn't want.
It’s a term I’ve used to create a genre for my books, obviously based on things like chick-lit and lad-lit. Dag is Australian slang for someone who is uncool and doesn’t follow the crowd but usually in a funny kind of way. Originally it was an insult (a bit like nerd) derived from the wool industry (the dags are the bits of poo stuck to the wool on a sheep’s bum) but its meaning has been flipped around and many people (myself included) now wear that badge with pride. I like it, partly because, like a true dag, my stories don’t follow the crowd and can be hard to classify. It also gives a sense of the audience I’m writing for. Dags can be young or old, male or female – they just need to have their own unique view of the world. And that’s a good description of the sort of readers I’m aiming for. – L.T.

He would like us to allow that maybe, just maybe, extraordinary coexists with the ordinary.

Side note: I first imagined this image all colored up in a rainbow of bright, tropical colors; however, with one or two lonely exceptions, rainbows and I just don't play together nicely. I opted for an all-blue bird, thinking the final colored image would be easier to work with. Are you kidding? You could conduct a traffic stop with this shade of blue! And I can assure you not one of my three bazillion pieces of patterned paper has this particular blue in it! All of this to say ... I'm a little skeered posting this one!

The Dani are among the last of the lost tribes, unknown to the world until 1939, when an aircraft chartered by the zoologist Richard Archbold flew over a 6,000ft ridge above the Baliem River, and discovered a secret valley of terraced gardens, dry-stone walls and cosy little villages, populated by a people still in the stone age.

There are medals to be won and cash to earn, but mostly it's an excuse to cut loose and trash some zombies. There's an achievement to kill 100,000 zombies. But by the time you've done that, you'll probably never want to play the game again. Zombie killing gets old eventually, even when you do it with as much style as Frank West.

This is because when much of humanity who is already prone to judgment hears such a term, they feel in themselves the separation and the feelings that the group of souls or soul in question is different from them and must be hated for it. It may be a bit difficult initially to break so to speak, the propaganda that has been placed over the eyes of so many dear souls who possess Lighted energy but who are simply directing such energy in the wrong avenues of Life; avenues that will gain them much negative karma and see them hindered in their growth as a soul.

Hebrews was to discourage Jewish Christians from going back to the sacrifices of Judaism, because they had everything they needed to deal with sin in the Church. That's why the last chapter says “We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat” (13:10). Clearly, the implication is that we do have the right to eat of this altar. It is absurd to pretend this has nothing to do with the Eucharist. We do have an altar.)

I threaded the leather through the button, leaving a long tail and secured that to the inside of the book with glue and electrical tape (No, it's not pretty, but it's strong and no one will ever see it.) with the button just poking out over the top of the book. On the opposite cover, I secured a loop of the black leather the same way - again, with just enough poking over the top of the book to be able to hook around the button and hold the bag closed.

Early this morning while it was still fairly cool I worked on the ditch on the hill. Spent most of the day in front of the computer. I had intended to go back and work some more on the ditch this evening when it cooled off, but my son showed up and he helped me finish clearing the culvert in creek. We realized that the water was high enough that it was actually coming over the top of the crossing and some water had been running right down my driveway. That is a bit scary because that is a huge amount of water backed up. I'll have to be really keeping an eye on things and get the culverts cemented in ASAP, with a little overflow channel in case this happens again.

Reader Justicar called my attention to the fact that the faithful are already appropriating Ehrman’s conclusions in support of their theology. Ehrman, of course, believes that there was a historical Jesus, even though that rabbi was neither divine nor a wonder-worker. But it doesn’t matter, as we can see in a piece by theologian/debater William Lane Craig, responding to Stephan Law’s piece, “Evidence, miracles, and the existence of Jesus,” which I discussed yesterday.
Revlon Luxurious Living Lipstick in Orchid Beach is the brightest lipstick I have ever found at the drugstore, and I just about did a nervous pee when I first saw it. It's an almost-neon Barbie Pink with old lady Estee Lauder-esque packaging and an old school crayon lipstick scent, which I find strangely comforting. It has a very thin texture but is incredibly pigmented, and I won't even lie - sometimes I take this out just to stare at it.

The OB's and nurses took off... I felt so discouraged. I felt as though I had failed. Hours passed and no one was talking to us. Ryan started to get mad. I was in so much pain and we didn't even know if the crazy contractions were doing what they were supposed to be doing! They seemed so random and hurt unbelievably. Ryan got the nurse to come in, then the resident. He was my strong arm. He asked what the goal was, they said "progression"... yeah, we got that... Ryan got a little forceful, asking what they wanted the contractions to do and how we needed to get them there. The poor man had watched tears come to my eyes time and time again as a contraction hit that I wasn't prepared for and then another, and another, and another. Finally, the OB explained that I needed more Pitocin to get the pattern of a contraction every 2-3 minutes. They no longer wanted to see the unpredictable ones on the chart. Okay, we'll get more medication... turn up the drip. Then, I got an Epidural. More medicine. More disappointment. Then, I slept. Ahhh... glorious sleep!

Both were fresh tasting (I'd say they almost taste like Izze drinks - carbonated juice, but that give you a buzz) and a nice last taste in terms of beverages.

For my purposes I only want to use the lightest one (on the far right) but feel free to play around with them to see the affects you can get.
It’s not just things that are made in the USA that I prefer. It’s actually anything not made in China. So tonight I was reading the back of my toothpaste tube and read that it was made in England. I think this is a win for the “not made in china” team. Like I said, I’m sure china is great and all, but I think society has trained me to dislike all things made in china.

It's 3:09am. I got home later last night from two days of sales meetings, which apart from being fun and worthwhile, make this chubby-mummy a little tired... more so when you're pregnant of course because having to turn your brain on max capacity for two days straight is like trying to pull my pre-pregnancy skinny jeans up over my hips at this point... impossible and complete with post-marathon-esque exhaustion. Throw some air travel in there and BAM, recipe for potential disaster. Which currently describes the status of my face... itchy, flaky, red spots have taken over to the point that when I itched my right eyebrow for the last two days it appeared to be snowing in the conference room when in fact it was just my rejected skin falling off my face in public... you know, the pregnancy glow! I also managed to pick up two friends for Cindy Crawford (my faithful sidekick of a pimple that's been with us since January) which is delightful as it's likely I've picked up three new scars for the Dermatologist I will never see (due to shortages) to laser off.

We were greeted by da sounds of our local DJs featuring the likes of Kay Moloco and Tommy T setting up the mood as the night was still young. The Ladies looked fabulous and the Gents were all clean and pushing da Pheli swagg as usual. Although I would have loved to see a lot of 80z rock T-shirts being worn as they usually do, I guess da venue played a role in that not being the case.

Obadiah gasped. Although he was hoping for an answer, when it came, he was taken aback. “Yes, sure thing,” he mumbled and grabbed the empty glass with shaky hand. Maybe he could come to some sort of arrangement with Mrs Maple, work off the whiskey like he did his food, he hoped, but Mrs Maple just re-filled the glass he put in front of her as if she wasn’t expecting payment.

Some researchers have suggested that the occupants of UFOs have a deep concern about the safety of nuclear power, and our proliferation of nuclear weapons, and are therefore keeping a close scrutiny of these sites. During the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster on April 26, 1986, technicians reported that they observed a fiery sphere, similar in color to brass, within 1,000 feet of the damaged Unit 4 reactor during the height of the fire, about three hours after the initial explosion.
Two and three dimensional work in all media will be considered. If work exceeds 6 feet in any direction, or weighs more than 50 pounds, artists should contact the Museum to confirm whether or not it can be accommodated in the galleries.

It looks fantastic. A slightly hazy golden ale with a vigorous bead, it pours out like a beer from Brussels. The effervescence is a good sign that Larry Sidor got the yeast right--it hasn't been overwhelmed by the alcohol (later, the liveliness on the tongue will confirm this). The Curacao is evident in the nose, though the hops are somewhat subdued. There's a touch of volatility from the alcohol, and a wee bit of hard candy.
The on-screen chemistry between Chase and D’Angelo is fascinating to watch, because they’re amazing together without really being amazing together. Theirs is a very subtle relationship, with Clark sometimes seemingly oblivious to just how great his wife is to him, and for him. Clark repeatedly gets lost in the quest for the perfect moment as Ellen subtly stands by to prop him up.
Not too surprisingly, the nest at the Nature Center that was the first observed with little ones was also empty. In a bit of good news, however, the nest at Pueblo Montano where we’d seen both adults but never any chicks from the end of March to mid-April finally had two little ones that I got to see way up in their nesting tree. The female was perched off to the side of the nest, so the little ones must be growing up fast. Finally, I stopped by the nest at Albuquerque Academy I’d last visited on April 13 when two little ones were just barely visible. Today, the parents weren’t anywhere to be seen but the two little ones were perched in the nest tree and look as if they are just about to graduate into full adulthood. This one looks to be the younger of the two and still has quite a bit of baby fluff going on.

This book describe different behavioral adaptation on how animals eat. It shows how each animal is prepare to eat and capture their preys in a specific way which is an adaptation to their own nature and needs. What is interesting is that for many animals the book provides a brief information card that points out the animal's behavior and some physical characteristics of it according to the environment where the animal lives and the preys it has to capture. Finally, at the beginning there is a food chain that it has to be combine and at the end you can find the answers.

Well, I am finishing Bleach. I constantly check the list of episodes on the Wiki because I like knowing what arc I am currently on. :3 Well anyway I am on Episode 312 and still watching. Some people think that these mainstream Animes are bad, I used to be one of them too. But, you know what, there is a reason why they have that much episodes. Sure, there are some primetime animes that I don’t like, but that’s because we all have our own tastes. :3 Ichigo is awesome, though I get the feeling that his strength usually comes from an outside source, sure there is Zangetsu, but Zangetsu is part of Ichigo. What I am trying to say is that he seems to get close to dying alot, then just gets ridiculously strong because of that outside source(Hollow Ichigo is part of those Outside Sources, except when he uses the mask, what I am saying is that when Hollow Ichigo takes over him). Well, everyone still knows that Goku owns them all no problem if they have a crossover, Hahaha! Here’s an image of Bleach that you can easily find in Google(I think it’s the first image).
The impression was also created by certain people that they knew exactly who the Illuminati were and what they were up to. Little did I realize back then that those people knew diddley squat, for if they were true Bible-believing Christians they would have called that ominous force by its real names, namely: Satan the antichrist. But then again, non-religious folk don’t use Biblical terminology in their debates, and don’t believe that an evil entity called “Satan” exists.

For easy access, an apothecary jar with a glass top is a great choice. If your container does not have a lid, you can cover it with clear plastic wrap, a piece of Plexiglas or a sheet of glass. Leaving it open is another option, but watering needs will vary.

“8-4-1 Expedition Ale is a great beer. Its combination of brown sugar and honey, paired with a variety of rich specialty and smoked malts before being aged for months with oak chips, give it a depth worth sipping next to the fire. Inspired by eight brewers working four teams, 8-4-1 offers complex nuances to the traditional American-Style Strong Brown Ale that I am confident beer connoisseurs will appreciate.”
Well, I thought the movie went well so I was slightly confident with how the date was going. We walked out of the theater and it was already 1am so we knew we were parting ways. We parked in opposite directions so I asked if he would take me to my car since he knew his way around. When we got into the car, he asked what music I like. I said everything but rap. He seemed a little disappointed in that answer. And then I asked what his schedule is like and what days he has school. Trying to figure out what days we could get together again... So by the time we got to my car, I asked him when he would be free again. He answers, "Well, I'm pretty busy with school... I have finals in a week, and then it's my graduation.. so I'm busy." Hearing that, I just kinda took the hint that he wasn't interested. I mean, if he WAS interested, he wouldn't have said all that right? So I just kinda turned to him and said "well, you just let me know when you're free if you still want to hang out then." So with a little disappointment, I turned to him in my seat and motioned for a hug goodnight instead of the kiss goodnight that I would've like.

Most of you are aware that there are whistleblowers amongst you who have put themselves forward, to reveal what is happening where both the military and financial activities are concerned. Their help is important to ensure that until the media can be freed from their restraints and truthfully report the news, that you know that we are very active in backing up our allies. Our presence and back up will ensure that any attempt to start another World War will be unsuccessful. We are also making sure that where the arrests for criminal acts involving financial matters are concerned, that those who are guilty do not escape justice. However, we ask you to leave such matters to the authorities, and when you learn the facts not to let your anger result in reprisals. All will answer at some stage for their actions against the people. Your energy is best spent spreading the Light and sending Love to all those that need it at this special time.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1884 that “the United States does not and cannot hold property, as a monarch may, for private or personal purposes. All the property and revenues of the United States must be held and applied, as all taxes, duties, imposts and excises must be laid and collected, to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States” (Van Brocklin vs Anderson; (1884-85 U.S. 117 U*S.151 at 158). Arbitrary expenditure unrelated to public purpose also violates the fundamental right to equality (Art. 14).

Last month I had a lot of fun writing about spring cleaning. Many of you emailed me some great tips, stories, and take a ways. It was a fun topic chosen by one of my readers. I really enjoyed the writing challenge. This month I want to focus on the topic of leadership. This topic is one that always generates great conversation. Recently I was at dinner with some colleagues of mine. We began to discuss the best boss each of us ever had. As we told stories about each of our experiences I noticed common themes. Great bosses seemed to empower, motivate, encourage, support, and connect with their staff in a meaningful way. Soon the conversation turned to telling horror stories about working for a bad boss. When it came to our experiences with having a bad bosses, themes were also evident. Themes of bad bosses included micro-management, manipulation, short tempers, and dishonesty.

After the tournament, the top player in each of two categories – rated (those who are members of U.S. Chess Federation) and unrated (those with no tournament experience) – will go on to vie in the national championships hosted by the U.S. Chess Federation.

In the Sermon the Mount, Jesus told us about the GOLDEN RULE: “DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE DONE UNTO YOU.” People today, have completely lost sight of this rule. Whatever the reason may be, it all comes down to one theme in this reasoning, and that is of the “SELF”; and using earthly logic to explain what is divine in logic, which is beyond all earthly parameters. Think about it, to Unconditionally Love, is there any logic (of what we understand) to it? Examples of this would be love shared between a parent and a child; a pet and its master; husband and wife; siblings for each other….this love is undying…relentless….and sacrificial in nature. Well, through the Golden Rule, Jesus is saying that God tells us to love this way for EVERYONE that walks in our life paths; and to not carry any ill feelings for our fellow neighbor. I know that this is one of the hardest things to do. This is why Jesus said this, as a reminder for us, when we feel that we have become so weak to the ways of this world….remember “would we like to be treated, the way we have treated another….?”
So, questions become important to verify the message that was intended was received. Don’t think of questions as attacks on you or your character, but as a means of confirmation.

We stopped off in Toms River which is a really large town in South Jersey. I thought there were a few places we could stop at, but as we got off the Parkway I started to realize there weren't as many stores as I thought. Miss Sexy Armpit said "Hey, look, Guns and Roses!" "That's an awesome name for a flower shop," I replied to her. We really hit the jackpot because it's located so close to exit 81 and we figured we could avoid the ridiculous weekend crowds of grocery stores and big name shopping centers.

Since evolutionists have used fossils so wrongly for so long it is vital that we understand the true nature of the fossil. In reality animals or plants need to be buried quickly and thoroughly so they can be preserved and not just decay and be taken away by scavengers. In order for this to happen a flood or rush of sediment is the best way to fossilize something.

When old attraction pales, new approaches are needed. Some Belgian pale ales have seen their volumes dropping as post-industrial Belgium is consuming less beer and more wine. The thirst for Belgian craft beer from the rest of the world has been more important to the smaller breweries, often with more assertive beers.

This has been the one constant of Hawkeye's character from his very earliest appearances. How else do you think that a normal dude, with just a bow and some fancy trick arrows, could ever actually believe he was worthy to stand next to the likes of Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man - a Norse god who can level mountains with a throw of his magic hammer, a super-soldier who fought in World War II, and a brilliant engineer who was able to build the most powerful suit of armor on the planet out of old car parts and transistor radios while bleeding to death in a bamboo shack in Vietnam? The answer to this question is that Hawkeye gets to stand next to the most powerful beings on the planet simply because he's earned the right to be there. He simply doesn't quit: even after all these years he's still got something to prove. He'll always have something to prove. He covers it up with jokes and an attitude, but he's got an absolutely indomitable will, and alongside it a willingness to do anything - even cheat! - to win the day.
So… if my path should ever cross with Teresa MacBain’s I will show her the sort of love and patience that Jesus has shown me, even at my lowest moments. And I think I’ll sit down with her and ask her about all those holes that were left in her story when NPR ran it. And maybe in a loving moment she will glimpse the Divine… maybe she won’t. It’s not my place to judge her. It’s only my place to love her.

With the exception of veterans eligible for the VA system and active duty military personnel, most Americans under the age of 65 are either self-insured or have health insurance either as a benefit of employment.

Lessons we can draw from these countries include:

Only, you know how most legit roller coasters have a safety bar or some sort of safety apparatus that holds you in the seat? In case of some deathly incident that may or may not occur? Well, this one in my dream did not have such a safety thing. It did have a small belt strap (the kind that are on the ends of backpack straps) that go across your waist. Annnd that's it.

In the end, though, the songs really win out here. At least six of them, and British Steel earns its keep despite the sagging, unremarkable middle cuts. Certainly the first 15 minutes of the album are comparable in quality to nearly anything else in their catalog, and its logical that this would be one of their better sellers in England and the States. Heavily promoted, and not surprisingly, defined as a major milestone in the genre due to its success and the utter stickiness of some of the songs.
00. THREE FLOYDS - STYLE UNTO ITSELF
May 29th I’ve noted that my son’s school Principal called and that they definitely wanted to downgrade him. She said he was vacant in class and had “quiet” defiance. She once again said she felt he was depressed and that she recommended counselling. My son said he’d rather go to public school than to be mocked and teased about being downgraded from College to Academy level. My son didn’t seem all that upset, but I sure was and was extremely disappointed and cried. My son told me he had no homework that night. I’ve noted “BAD DAY!!!” and hadn’t done a note like that in a long time so it must have been bad.
Here was the problem. I had a set but didn’t have a good dramatic lighting. My usual lighting designer was directing a show while getting ready for his next show, so I had to look on the side for some good help.
For the last few months, I've heard a lot of talk about banning babies children from different places - restaurants, airplanes, stores. I'm sitting here now watching the Dr. Phil show, which happens to be on the topic. Guests on the show are spouting off their opinions like diarrhea of the mouth... and there seems to be a very obvious similarity between the people who believe in limiting the places where babies and children are allowed to go - none of them have children. One is a restaurant owner who has banned children under the age of 6 from his establishment. One is a waiter who thinks it's annoying to have children sit at his tables because they are messy (specifically citing Cheerios as a major point of annoyance). And the other two guests are a couple who compared children to second hand smoke. Nice. So do you think people who don't have children should be allowed to dictate what you should do with yours?
How different the world looked to me. The sunshine seemed brighter, my heart was beginning to realized there was no death sentence. The Lord is taking care of me. It made me want to hug my family, kiss my husband and children, and to take more time to BE with those around me, to love them in whatever way I can. To laugh more, to ask people more questions, to tell more people about the Love of Christ.
Seemingly opposite are those pacifists who can be heard calling out to the cops, “Your part of the 99%”. These pacifists perpetuate the lie that the state is class neutral and the cops are workers just like the rest of us. This ignores a fact that every working class kid in the UK learns as a child, a fact that most people of color figure out some time in their teen years and that is that the role of the cops is to keep poor and working class people in their place especially when they organize strikes and community self defense or when the 99% decide to fight back. The cops are enforcers for Wall Street. They, as an institution can not be won over by moral arguments any more than stock holders can be convinced to elevate morals and ethics over profit. Ultimately this mythology perpetuated by the pacifists prevents workers and oppressed people from preparing workers, Black and Brown self defense guards and thereby allows the cops, ICE, the racists, the homophobes, and anti-Semites to brutalize our people our movements and smash our organizations and picket lines. The anarchists and pacifists the liberals and fake socialists all come together to disarm the working class by elevating the movement over program and allowing mystifications such as: cops being part the 99%, the crisis of capitalism seen as a moral failure rather than the trajectory of an outdated mode of production unable to contain its own contradictions, the denial of the need to clearly define a working class action program to create a class struggle movement leads the unaware into class collaboration and capitulation to our class enemies program, and adopting a modes of struggle leading to the defeat of our class. Neither window breaking nor turning the other cheek serve us!

but for a moment i want to dive into the emotional component that goes into watching your hair fall out. your little baby pulling in out without even meaning to. to when you shave it. put on a scarf. wear a wig or rock the bald head with all the confidence in the world. such confidence i did not have. i chose to wear a hat. to hide. to cover it up. in many ways save myself from what i thought shaving my head would do to my soul and to my heart. i chose to wear a hat. about six weeks after chemo ended and i was cancer free my hair had filled in enough to cut it all real short. so i did. i was nervous for people to see it. i was terrified of the response. thankfully no one said anything mean and for the most part it was okay. it is now a year later and my hair has grown a ton. thank you, Lord. long enough even for a little tiny ponytail.
I’m also a small business owner and, statistically speaking, I know that there are thousands of you who own small or medium-sized businesses, or own and operate nudist clubs, or simply care about others who struggle to succeed in a competitive marketplace.

It resided in my bad throughout those few warmer weeks and was great for refreshing my skin and my makeup.

So I am thinking that is my first step. I am going to start blogging again. Maybe not even about S. Maybe just about me, and my day. And maybe it will be boring and maybe that will be ok. But I have to start somewhere, so here I am.
Those departments have forms to fill out and among the questions they ask is Who is going to publish the book; How many copies will be printed; Where will the books be sold and so forth.
So that's about it. I have a new resolve at the moment to not let myself become overwhelmed. And while I will honestly try to post great things everyday, forgive me if you see gaps now and again. I promise to never abandon you! :) I love all of my sweet readers and I really appreciate you for coming and reading about this little mommy's life. I love all of your comments, and I hope that we can stick it out together, it being life.

“Nerve, character, an ability to perform in a white-hot atmosphere, refereeing decisions and, yes, luck on the night will all play a part in this massive match. Just sit back and watch it unfold with us. This is as big as they come.” Ian Darke, a commentator for ESPN, wasn’t underestimating the significance of this match. According to NYTimes.com, what was called the “most anticipated match in Premier League history” was broadcasted to over 650 million homes in 203 territories. After about 95 minutes, the match of the year ended in a 1-0 win by the home team, Manchester City.
I thought this was a fun little technique and not too hard to create at all! Hope you have a wonderful start to your week! For those that read my Friday post about -- basketball, basketball and more basketball... I'm happy to report DS won both of his games by a landslide and DD won hers by 6 points. So... YIPPPEEE! Next game is tomorrow! Ahhh, to be a basketball mom. I love it!
Regardless, the four of us were sipping great wine, and the Aussie and I were celebrating the fact that we still had a week together.
She had first gained national prominence with her third poetry collection, “Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law,” in 1963. Citing the title poem, University of Maryland professor Rudd Fleming wrote in The Washington Post that she “proves poetically how hard it is to be a woman — a member of the second sex.”

OK, I have been a majorly bad blogger. At least my template is fixed now. But God only knows how long it was like that! I will say that life with a little one is even more busy than I expected, and when I get a spare minute I usually want to spend it playing with Emmett or catching up around the house (which I never actually get caught up on!) or catching up on z's (another thing I never actually get caught up on!)

Now, on to this week. It's that time of year again, some are happy to see school days back again, others are not happy (especially me, I have to go back to work - boo!). So our challenge is a very timely one - "Back to School/Starting School".
As the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister it would be nice if they, in reference to the fact that they are the servants of the people and were elected by us, would just occasionally leap to our defence. Is it too much to ask that we have in the government people who will just live by the rules? How is this man an example of someone with integrity? He's resigned over the scandal caused by his behaviour and there are people calling for his resignation as an MP.
I went to a gathering where there about 40 people. There were tables and chairs set up, and people were eating snacks and drinks.

I taught Relief Society today and as I looked out at the women I can honestly say I love all of them. I didn't know 1/2 of them but there is a bond between women in the church. We are all striving to live the gospel and improve each day. We aren't perfect and we all have our weaknesses but I don't feel judged or that I'm not good enough for them. They seem to all have the desire to reach out and serve. I truly feel at home here.
Vibratory sensations, as perceived by the hand, are of importance in teaching the auditory impaired to speak. By placing one hand on the larynx of a speaker and the other hand on his own larynx, they learn the vibration patterns of speech sounds. When the patterns "heard" by his left and right hand are identical, the student has succeeded in imitating the sound.

This is an ideal work to be used in a classroom. Giving children knowledge of this disease before he or she has to actually face it, as many, many will, gives them a bit of a head start in the process of learning to deal with the many issues they will be faced.

Andrew Batt, Regional Group Editor for PropertyGuruand a regular attendee at property exhibitions himself, said: “I can certainly echo these observations. As buyers and investors look to overseas opportunities in greater numbers, so attendance at these overseas property events is growing. Events in Singapore, Malaysia and the U.K. that I have attended in the last couple of months are certainly proof that overseas property is hotter than ever.”
I would love to learn how to bake from scratch & know everything that’s going into my body; not so I can control it, but so I can revel in the joy of knowing that what I eat is doing my body this amazing nutritional service. I remember something a teacher said to me in year 4; learning about acute angles & right angles. “There are no right angles in nature, that’s something man has manufactured.” In nature, things aren’t sharp & cut & dry. In nature, it’s ok if things aren’t perfect. It’s the world that we’ve made that makes things sharp & perfect. I’d rather nature.

Second Category: “The Intellect and the Senses.” If you thought the last one was esoteric, this one is even more so. Common sense and reason tell us that there is a difference between our thoughts and our senses. One is informed by the other, but they are not the same thing. And you would think it would take a real moron to mistake the two. Well, let me introduce you to Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, George Berkley, David Hume who basically thought they were one in the same…and Plato, Descartes, Kant and Hegel who thought that they had little to nothing to do with each other. The reason this becomes a problem is that it begins to degrade the nature of language (I’ll spare you the steps on how this works, trust me this is what Adler points out)…and that this is also a basis for the arguments of crackpots who think that humans are not superior to animals. So if PETA has ever annoyed you, you can blame this logical error as being part of that problem.

Yes, you read that right. Back in those days, they would let a shot play out to nearly 40 seconds! This shot is all about how the seed of suspicion has now spread. The first two women hovering over the third one, letting her know the man who robbed them twice before has returned. This also has the first camera move that calls attention to itself. Previous moves had been following action through tracking and panning. This shot is a distinct dolly in to frame the three women tighter, as their suspicion takes over their behavior. The dolly does not cover the entire shot. Only from 10 seconds in to 20 seconds in, but, during that time, the third woman is convinced by the other two that Manny is the robber without turning her head and actually looking at him!
Are college sports also BS since they don’t pay their players? Both college and amateur sports are avenues to becoming better at your given craft, developing a competitive edge and then potentially going pro. What about all of the UFC guys that started their careers in the amateur ranks? Did they just waste their time? Were they taken advantage of by the very same promotions that gave them their start? Most amateur promotions get into putting on events for the love of the sport, not to make millions.

Infuse my work with spirit
I distinctly remember my first college math class during freshman year. In the middle of an aggressive flare, I felt and looked like death. While the professor doodled equations on the board, I was in my seat waging a fierce internal battle: should I just leave? I’m gonna be sick. No, I should stay, it’s only day one. I need to be strong. If this is what college is going to be like, I’d sooner be dead. It was the lowest point in my life, initially. Then someone mentioned the disabilities office that was on campus. I went to see them and suddenly, the whole college experience was turned around. It’s okay to ask for help. It’s okay to tell your professors, “Hey, here’s a letter from my doc. Be forewarned, I’m gonna be sick.” And if they give you any crap, just remind them of the legal ramifications. Happily, for me, it never came to that. It became a lesson on balance. I found that health seems to put itself first and then dabble in every area of life. I worked with it instead of against it.

Who in the hell goes around saying things like "we are fully prepared to launch a sacred nuclear war". Why do despots say stupid things like that? Nothing good can come of that kind of rhetoric. It makes you look desperate. To say nothing of stark raving mad, especially when somebody like New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, a former Congressman and diplomat, says North Korea is a "tenderbox" and the worse he has ever seen it, in the wake of a recent visit to Pyongyang.
Someone tipped me off about this amazingly talented writer called Valerie Patterson when I first arrived in the USA from London in Autumn 2007. The Greenhouse was just getting underway, so of course I lost no time in tracking her down – especially as we live fairly near each other in Virginia. I was blown away by the beauty of Val’s writing, her acute perceptions, her sensitivity to language. It’s a truism that now – especially in a difficult economy - everyone is after high-concept fiction, and that literary writing is going to be impossible to sell, or at least very tough. However, I felt Val deserved to be discovered and published, and I had a strong sense that this was my mission, especially as a former fiction editor and publisher myself.

5:20/5:30- We all get home and I start to get dinner going. We're Dave Ramsey people, so I am pretty strategic with our meal plans for the week. Or at least as good as I can be with the time that I have. I usually try to pick meals that are easy, quick, healthy and affordable without being too processed. I make 99% of our meals from scratch, but there are times that I take shortcuts to save time or money when necessary. Tonight we are having Cajun Pork Chops that I had in the freezer and some Not So Dirty Rice (without the sausage). I'm a big believer in having everyone eat together at the table. When we were first married I would always cook, but we usually ate in the living room. After Brody came along and could sit in a high chair, we moved dinner to the table. We always talk about our days. One time at dinner, Brody asked us "what was your favorite part of the trip" from Dora, and it has stuck, so we will ask him "what was your favorite part of the day" and he asks both of us the same. Sometimes he'll initiate it if we've taken too long!

In a sidebar called “Ghost Plots” that appears pretty early in Pottermore, Rowling talks about the sheer amount of worldbuilding she did over the seventeen years it took to plan and write the novels and spin-off books which resulted in the titular “ghost plots”—storylines for characters both major and minor that were either cut or never made it into the books. Pottermore— http://www.themarysue.com/rowling-harry-potter-encyclopedia/ http://www.themarysue.com/rowling-harry-potter-encyclopedia/ http://www.themarysue.com/rowling-harry-potter-encyclopedia/">and the ensuing Harry Potter encyclopedia—is a way to get that information out into the world. Pottermore, when complete, will boast 18,000 words worth of new content expanding the series. This is just the sort of thing that Harry Potter fandom eats up, which is an appetite shared by other fandoms—why do you think there’s a Star Wars Expanded Universe? So I get it. And I did enjoy reading all the new content, from the behind the scenes stuff to the backstories.
People keep asking me if I’m excited to be moving to New York. My answers vary but the truth is that I’ve been having a hard time believing it. It’s a drastic move. I’ve spent a few months far away from friends and family but never moved so far away by myself. I’m not scared, it’s just new. Plus, I’ve moved enough to know that as cool as it will be to be in a new environment it is also lonely and draining for a while. It always takes time to settle in and make good friends.

As such, death and the doom of Men loom large over all three stories. But with this difference: Beren and Lúthien and The Fall of Gondolin each have a eucatastrophic[3] twist absent in The Children of Húrin. Beren, like Lazarus, escapes death, at least for a little while; Tuor the sojourner in Gondolin marries the King’s daughter and afterwards is counted among the Elves, and “his fate is sundered from the fate of Men.”[4]

Look. I'm 31 years old. I have been out of college for 9 years. I am not a child. I am not a moron. I am not falling for a ploy. This "opportunity" is selling discount coupons door to door for restaurants. Coupons that's creative is done in India. I have already done door to door sales, back in the 80's with the Girl Scouts. THEY don't even go door to door anymore!

Some of the words and facts you are about to read here have been lying idle for years in various folders scattered on my computer’s hard drive, while others have remained locked in my brain, dormant but not forgotten. With the exception of the first few opening paragraphs, which deal with a few personal background facts and a brief history of South Africa, the personal account of events depicted here covers a time span of roughly 24 years, starting from 1978 and ending in 2001. This is my first attempt to go public with my story.
I think we all know what is going on here: The Embassy discriminates against non-1970s era blue pens who are not made by the Lighthouse for the Blind.

Some people might think we are crazy for sitting on the floor for 2 hours and then in a theatre for 3 more hours just to see a movie and I think they might be right, but I wouldn't trade the memories we made and the fun we had for anything.
My advice to LMU, loosen up!
I think we can simplify these definitions into something like "anything that has the ability to represent something else." So in essence, all communication is predicated on a system of meaning, which is constituted by signs. Communication is the interplay of individual signs to create a context in which meaning can be derived.

"Voyage" continues where "Adventure" left off with more strange sonic cosmos and amazing percussive tones and moods. Essentially "Voyage" was a live in studio jam which got carried away one evening and was captured on tape for the world to enjoy. Once again we are surrounded by the electronic genius of Joel Vandroogenbroeck and his gang of merry men. "Voyage" seems to be more devoted to exploring the percussive side of their music in sharp contrast to "Adventure" and "Celestial Ocean". "Voyage Part 1" would certainly rank as one of my all time electronic Krautrock favs. 3 more bonus tracks have been included as well in the same vein as those found on "Adventure".

The team of engineers and technicians at Hypertech R&D center in Memphis uses two computerized chassis dynamometers to develop the most powerful tuning programs possible. First they experimentally adjust the spark timing to obtain the highest torque and power readings at a given engine rpm. Then they adjust the air/fuel ratio to obtain the highest possible power and torque readings that an optimized air/fuel mixture can produce. After the spark timing and air/fuel ratio for that particular engine speed have been optimized, the rpm is increased to the next point and the entire procedure is repeated again. The process continues, point by point, up to the engine’s maximum speed. This technique is called experimental, point-by-point curve fitting. There is no more effective way to power tune an engine.
I’ve been staying with my almost 95-year-old father, not to take care of him so much as to look out for him. Last year, the two of us spent a quiet Thanksgiving. He wasn’t up to company and neither was I since it was the first Thanksgiving after my life mate’s death. This year, a couple of my brothers (who perhaps had no more exciting plans) decided they wanted to get together for dinner, and one fast-talking brother conned . . . er, sweet-talked . . . my father into letting them come here. This brother also negotiated a deal where up to six people could stay for two hours. (Which worked out to be three brothers and their mates.) If you knew how quickly that many people would wear out a 95-year-old recluse, you’d understand what a great concession my brother wangled. (BTW, I really admire this brother’s negotiating skills. I once saw him talk a clerk at Office Max into giving him an extra l0% discount, and the guy agreed to it for no reason that I could see.)
For many years people have always thought that the ancient ruins in southern Africa were mere cattle kraals built by local tribes. Professor Thomas Huffman from the Witwatersrand University, apparently conceived this idea in the 1970s. Recently Professor Tim Maggs, an archaeologist, confirmed this viewpoint. It turns out however that neither of these men knew anything about cattle, and nor did they bother to examine all the ruins thoroughly, -- because Dr. Cyril Hromnik, an American currently employed by the University of Cape Town, pointed out that some circular ruins (supposed cattle kraals) had no entrance, and that certain entrances were way too narrow for the thinnest and most lean cattle to fit through. Hromnik concluded that the ruins must have been temples, and based his conclusions on the fact that the stone structures were, in certain places, built according to astronomical solar alignments.

For a member of any of the main political parties to promise they will do anything about about immigration is no different than a serial rapist claiming he's gone gay and can now be trusted with your daughter, their past actions expose the dishonesty and cynicism of their lie.

Basically, we’ve dumbed down the game to make it easier to code since, to be frank, coding is a completely foreign language to the both of us. The player competes against the computer, and upon finishing a drawing, the player’s drawing is stored in the database to be accessed by another player. Through this process, we would have about 15 words with 100 different drawings for each word. We want to use this information later on to understand how people can interpret simple drawings at different speeds using different visual cues. Though the complexity of storing a drawing into the array is mind numbing, we’ve trudged through and hopefully will have a working prototype on Thursday.

This week, we will concentrate on the most devastated area of Vocabulandia – Qfarington – which is the county seat of Qvince. The County Courthouse was utterly destroyed, and it is also the home of the County Administrator, the famed fortune-teller, Mme. Quorialis. The most evident and tragic bit of destruction was that of the county’s Qmancy. Qmancy is the abbreviated form of the mancy correctly called “Querimonymancy.” For the uninformed among you, “Querimonymancy” is the use of a large portion of complaints to divine the future of a chronic whiner. As you can probably guess, the future of such persons is seldom a pretty sight, which of course gives the whiner plenty of material for future complaints. The tragedy of losing Querimonymancy is that whiners now have nothing about which to complain.

I need to motivate myself by constantly connecting my routine and occasionally mundane daily responsibilities and work to my deepest core values and purpose, as doing so brings meaning to my work and helps me weed out the time-wasting stuff, so that I focus my attention and efforts to do what really matters, first and best.

It is true enough that, in these circumstances, “the rationale underlying the presumption—that the PTO, in its expertise, has approved the claim - seems much diminished,” KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S. 398, 426, though other rationales may still animate the presumption. But the question remains whether Congress has specified the applicable standard of proof. As established here today, Congress did just that by codifying the common-law presumption of patent validity and, implicitly, the heightened standard of proof attached to it. The Court’s pre-Act cases never adopted or endorsed Microsoft’s fluctuating standard of proof. And they do not indicate, even in dicta, that anything less than a clear-and-convincing standard would ever apply to an invalidity defense. In fact, the Court indicated to the contrary.However, while not endorsing any particular methodology, the Court did note that unconsidered evidence may be given more weight during trial via jury instructions:

The chemical prolongs sodium channel activation which is a fancy way of saying it kicks the ass out of bugs. Here there are mosquitoes galore, but because the part of Nicaragua I live in is really dry, we have a crap ton of ticks. The ticks (garapatas) range in two varieties, big and small. The big ones are nasty looking, and physically hurt when they bite you, however their size makes them easy to spot, low in numbers and easy to remove. Not to mention they don’t carry lime disease. The small red ones however are very difficult to spot (about the size of a grain of salt), carry lime disease, and don’t alert you when they are biting you.

Well today, a measure of uncertainty returns with the tabling of a Bill by Fianna Fail to abolish Upward Only Rent Reviews. The Bill is called the Landlord and Tenant (Business Leases Rent Review) Bill 2012 and it should be published shortly on the Oireachtas website here. Fianna Fail deputy Dara Calleary, who introduced the Bill, sets out more information about its contents and objectives here. Fianna Fail presently has 19 deputies in the 166-member Dail though it is likely to find support from other elements of the Opposition, but ranged against a Government which holds a decisive majority with 109 even after deducting the four who have lost the whip, the Bill seems unlikely to get off the starting blocks.

I have days where I am completely frozen by anxiety and fear. It was my Birthday yesterday and I was literally stuck in my chair for hours, sweating and freaking out. I couldn't even go to my ceramics class. I don't know if this is extended withdrawals or if it is suboxone side effects, which are similar. I see my, MY, Dr. on the 10th and will be talking about my dosing, my debilitating anxiety, as well as the program at the mental health center.

‘Warp’ is a bit more on the bouncy and danceable side. Perhaps my imagination has been fired by too many bottles of Tsingtao, but the instrumental breaks make me think of Doctor Who on speed. Elsewhere, the vocals are again redolent of early Eighties dark-wave as we probably know it now. The guitars chime in and out, the cymbals crash and for me, this is the stronger track. Love this one!
On Thursday I took the girls to pick up my sister and then we all went to my parents' house to water their trees, etc. while they're out of town and pick whatever was ripe from the orchards and garden. We came home with a big box full of delicious fresh peaches and nectarines, and another full of zucchini, yellow crookneck squash, tomatoes, and green beans. Man oh man, fresh home grown produce is one of the best things in life, I'm sure of it.
We're at that point in the move where the worst is both behind and in front of us and the present isn't really all that bad. Because yesterday, the trying part of the whole ordeal was having to hang around the house all day with nothing really to do but be available to answer the packers' questions should they arise. But these guys being professionals, and me being the organized sort, there really weren't many gray areas. So they assembled boxes and packed while I fiddled.

I'm a private person and I see no need to involve my readers in my personal life, but once in a while, I feel a need to reach out and connect.

But here's where I bring up the example of the artist formerly known as Voracious Vegan... she did experience massive changes apparently. She got very ill, lost her energy, and became depressed. To me, this effectively removes her choice. This is now the desert island scenario.
As I was thinking about answers to prayer and blessings which we receive from God, I thought of how it relates to children and their parents. Now a parent generally will give a child a gift or something that they desire if they have been obedient and basically displayed good behavior. However, if a child is disobedient and displays bad behavior, will a parent give that child a gift? I began to think how righteous our God is and how much He dislikes evil, disobedience, sin, and rebelliousness. Would God give us our heart’s desire if we were being disobedient, evil, sinful, or rebellious? I would think he would hold off on that gift or blessing until we developed a more righteous attitude and were willing to change what might be bad to good.
Am I advocating becoming the enemy? No. I am saying the person who is robbing you has certain traits, attitudes, and background. That is all.

What I realized after the liquor store incident is that my inability to move on, at some level, as evidenced by my ridiculous response to seeing him, isn’t about a lack of forgiveness; it isn’t even about anger: it’s about self-protection. I just didn’t want to get hurt again, so I ran away.

Regardless of the reason for the neglect, Dr. Clark is a teacher that should not be ignored, especially by Christians with an interest in philosophy or apologetics. Any concerns about his views pale in comparison to those of some other popular teachers such as Finney, Barth, and Schleiermacher who are widely read and discussed despite their blatant unorthodoxy. You may not agree with all of his conclusions but Dr. Clark will challenge you to think more critically about Christianity and how it applies to your worldview. If you don't believe me, ask R.C.

On the other hand, Tim Bratton General Counsel of the FT who tweets as @legalbrat likes his holidays to be just that, a holiday. He wrote a blog disagreeing with Lucy’s pro worliday stance.

So, Professor Cathy Warwick, they are an important diagnostic tool, but they also provide a wonderful record of the pregnancy. It's a special time for some of us. Nervewracking for those of us who have already lost babies. As each month went by and no problems were picked up, or nothing unmanageable, it was a wonderful way of allowing us to start bonding with our baby. My husband in particular, who couldn't share each flutter and then, later on, kick, was entranced. We didn't hold a fetus party, but I will be grateful forever that we were lucky enough to be able to watch our daughter grow and develop in this way. I do not approve of private companies ripping people off by making them pay for these scans, but it appears that is the way in the UK nowadays.

In the years since Saudi and Egyptian radicals destroyed the World Trade Center, Egypt has received upwards of $20 billion in American aid, and the Saudis have strengthened their position as “friends of the United States” and recipients of our military hardware, all the while vacuuming up the wealth of the West in return for the oil they happen to be sitting on top of.
Isabel Dakyns was, until yesterday, a tutor and examiner at BPP, despite having been disciplined in February 2008 for failing to comply with a judgement ordering her to cough up nearly £50k. The Bar Standards Board decided that her behaviour was likely to bring the Bar into disrepute and suspended her for a whopping 30 months. Which failed to prevent BPP from employing her to train the barristers of tomorrow on, errr, professional ethics. At least there’s a pleasing irony to it.”

Not only my handwriting was awkward. Sentences were awkward, too. My minor thoughts spelled out on paper were embarrassing. Since I had sworn off from using literary devices, there were no accounts of events, no attempts for a narrative or context, just jumbled descriptions of feelings, thoughts and random inner dialogues, mostly on my confusion about the guy who seemed convinced to be dating me while never having time to see me, and on my excursions with other guys.

A lesser man would not have reported the crime to avoid revealing that he had consorted with harlots; but Monsieur M’Vila put the rule of law above his own feelings of shame. He promptly called the police, who arrested the thieving hussies and returned their loot to its rightful owner. Such public-spirited behaviour certainly merits an official commendation of some sort. If not the Légion d'honneur, then certainly the Coq des justes.
There’s one area in the discussion of sea-level rise where there’s a growing consensus: a growing number of critics sat that the U.S. needs to rethink the policies – like subsidized Federal flood insurance – that they say encourage people to build in areas that will keep flooding over and over again. (The private insurance industry got out of writing flood policies in risky areas many years ago, and now the Federal government is currently the biggest backstop for losses in flood-prone areas.)
As my first post on this new blog about food, I’m going to post on eggs. This is fairly weird for me as I am quite weird about eggs and have to be in a particular mood to eat just an egg for a meal. Well, I’ve been in a mood lately to eat eggs and I finally decided to make them tonight.
Alright, so, thanks to dinner with Dimitri and friends on Friday night, I now know what Bdubs is (Buffalo Wild Wings). Yes, I don't know why it is called that either.

1. What is up with American’s not wanting to know what their coworkers think or believe, and then having a hissy fit when that belief goes against theirs on passionate issues? I can tell you that every day I have to listen to comments and language that I never want my kids to hear, much less myself. But if I speak out against it then I will not only be ostracized, but I would fall under the microscope to see how quickly I could be either put on a more “gentle” team or fired. I am a red-blooded American male and I don’t want to look at porn, talk about the different sexual positions someone had with a bar chick they met over the weekend, or hear the f-word used as a noun, adjective, and adverb constantly throughout my day. I am not going to interject my beliefs into the system unless asked directly about it, but I will pose counter points to the craziness that I hear.
Meanwhile, return skillet to medium-high heat and add garlic cloves and tomatoes, one cut side down. Cook until tomatoes are browned; turn tomatoes over and transfer skillet to oven with cauliflower. Roast garlic and tomatoes until tender, about 12 minutes.
Matilda was basically my childhood hero, and the scene where she first walks into the library and learns that she can have her own card and finally have access to all those books may as well be accompanied by a major rock anthem like “We Are the Champions” or “Welcome to the Jungle” for how much it pumps me up.
2(e)(1) Mere Descriptiveness: The Board found that "Coach" is merely descriptive of "educational materials used for preparing for standardized tests." The dictionary definition of the word and its use in the titles of educational books and CDs led the Board to conclude that "Coach" directly informs consumers that the products are for instruction.
Anyone who's in the Sacramento area, there will be craft fair tomorrow at Cowan Fundamental school. I will be there selling my art. 15% of all sales goes to the school.

One day, as Rapunzel was practicing to braid her substantial tresses, she contemplated how a few of her friends had either grown up in her town and moved away, or they had moved to her school from somewhere else. She often imagined the thrill of walking into a brand new class in a brand new town. There would be other kids her age that that didn’t even know her but would soon become her friends. They would simply and solely be attracted to her, and it would doubtlessly make her feel wonderful. Rapunzel longed to be able to experience such excitement, but she knew that her mom was having another baby and that her family wouldn’t want to move.

This works for every issue, I simply chose to use some of the most divisive and politically charged issues I could think of. We have convinced ourselves that we know better how our neighbor should live their life, that we try to use government to enforce our values on someone else. Who gave us the right to dictate what someone does in their own home? Do you want the government coming in to your living room and telling you what to do? Of course not.
Well, my first other than shoes and a new Wal-mart bought sports bra that is all kinds of awesome. Seriously, Wonderbra, I was dubious, but the girls did not jiggle, even a little! I love you, new sports bra. My husband? Not so much. He was crestfallen that there was no jiggle. He’s weird. I would be grumpy if there was jiggle, and he hates it when I am grumpy.
I was feeling ambitious and attempted one of the most traditional closed tart design. This entails wrapping the jam with the dough and shaping it into an acorn shape before making little snips around the tart to achieve the semblance of a little pineapple. The whole process of shaping and snipping was so laborious that I only managed to get some 20 tarts in close to an hour. I gave up and chose a simpler shaping method which only required me to roll the round dough across a little ribbed plastic panel.
Some days ago I got into a stupid argument with a girl on youtube. Youtube is actually my favourite thing to waste my time with and I watch videos about everything! The videos I watch mostly are about fashion, make-up, cooking or they are comedic web series but I also like to watch this one awesome guy that makes video game props, like full Skyrim armours and Zelda shields (He also has videos on how to forge reals swords! Real swords! With metal and fire and holy crap!).

I’m looking forward to Morgenstern’s next book, whatever it may be.
It’s a good cast dealing with what they’ve been given to the best of their abilities, but, honestly, the American angle was only added so they wouldn’t have to film the whole thing in Norwegian thereby alienating all those who don’t want to read the movie. They might’ve had a tighter film if they’d kept the Americans out of it because, other than to propel the movie forward, they add nothing to the story. As much as I like Mary Elizabeth Winstead in the film, any other character could’ve taken on that mantle.

Writers are largely solitary beasts. The process of writing, unless you're a sitcom duo like Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, is lonely by definition. Anything which fosters communication and social contact can only be a boon, and Twitter offers a wonderful sense of community. Obviously, nothing beats meeting people in person, but I love the way Twitter allows us to effortlessly keep up with acquaintances, friends and miscellaneous contacts, with spending too much time doing so. There are people I haven’t seen in ages, but who I feel like I see every day. There are also good friends I’ve made through Twitter, who I’ve never met, but certainly plan to (with their consent, obviously). It’s healthy for writers to form bonds with other scribblers who actually understand what they do for a living, who feel their pain when things go horribly wrong and can share information/contacts/pizza topping preferences. It's also very healthy indeed to talk to people who couldn't care less about writing.

Except we know that’s not the case.
I had a student in San Diego, my oldest student, a beautiful man who was 91 years old. The first time he came in he asked me “can you help me with this?” and pointed to his neck. He could barely move his neck more than a couple of inches side to side. He said it ached so much and so often and created so much trouble for him. He said his body was betraying him. I saw that his body was a prison. At 91 we were able to give him more and more range of motion to help him feel more at home in his body. Bodies change when the pattern of care for them changes. When we stop moving we lose flexibility and mobility. We lose range of motion. Which means we lose freedom. We imprison ourselves physically. When we don’t clean house mentally, we imprison ourselves. How many thoughts do you have lingering in the corners of your mind that no longer serve who you are today? These thoughts also imprison us!

There are so many varieties in pongal like milaku pongal, kalyana pongal, rava pongal, aval pongal etc. But, adding keerai varieties like palak, murungaikeerai, and mulaikkeerai to the pongal always enhance the taste tremendously. Especially drumstick leaves happen to give a delicious taste with tamarind and a little spices as side ingredients. Hope every one likes this.
I’m calling a doctor first thing Monday morning for a consultation for a vasectomy reversal, and if that doesn’t work, there’s always adoption. I can’t think of anything better than a house full of children. They are life’s biggest blessing, after all.
After rewatching it for the purpose of these retrospectives, I have found myself wanting to watch it again, and again, and it’s been on a more or less constant loop as I’ve been composing these articles. It’s now a definite favourite, one of those films that for not entirely definable reasons becomes more compelling the more familiar it becomes. That, at least, has been my own personal reaction to it.
The theme for the weekend is "Remembering Our History" and Carolyn Mazloomi, a noted quilt maker and historian, will be the quest speaker. Since this is the 15th Anniversary for Storytellers, this years challenge is to create a 12.5" block that depicts an event from African American History over the last 15 years. The block must contain white or white on white fabric, no more than 2 other colors and use crystals (the symbol for 15th Anniversaries) as an embellishment. Now for those of you who know me, I don't do challenges. Why.... I am a very literal person, so I have a hard time thinking out of the box and creating a piece that conveys the theme. See, to me 'theme' doesn't equal pattern or technique. Tell me to design a mariners compass quilt or to do something with applique or paper piecing and I am in. But a theme, my brain doesn't work that way. At least not until now....

It’s not my place to step into something like this, but I’ve done it before so I’ll do it again. As I do so, this ‘Tony’, a young man so very obviously at the top of the food chain, pushes this obviously rather confused Tracy, straight into a hedge.
What was passed on that day was an insight into how differently we think when it comes to cooking, or just generally. My eyes get big when I go to the supermarket or even the market, flooded with opportunity down every alley I go down, I often leave exhausted but inspired. Where as Perla will often search for the familiar, or the safe. However, after the Market Halo Halo experience cooking has become conversation and even a competition.
Bayswater station. Probably I might catch flack from some official for posting this... but you know what? I don't care. I thought the juxtaposition of light and dark was gorgeous. Wouldn't mind waiting for trains in that station.

Desc : Housefull 2… The Dirty Dozen is the second superstar packed installment in the HF franchise. A completely new story with new characters and a new star cast, HF2 is bigger than its predecessor in every aspect. It is the story of four fathers, four daughters and four prospective son-in-laws and as the second half of the tile suggests, they are the dirty dozen. Each father wants his daughter to marry the richest son-in-law, each daughter thinks she is marrying the richest son-in-law, each son-in-law is pretending to be the richest son-in-law. Each character is flawed, unscrupulous and extremely entertaining. The good news for the audience is that none of these people can stand each other and all of them are under one roof, in one house as the first half of the title suggests – HOUSEFULL

Here are some answers from other people going through this right now. Brooklyn does this all the time. She'll stand outside and and cry at the back door and won't let any of her brothers of sisters open the door for her to come inside. She'll cry, "I want Mommy do it!" I, not wanting to hurt her precious little feelings, say something like, "Mommy's busy. If you want to come inside, let Austin (or whoever) hold the door open for you." When she flings herself down and screams, "NO! You do it!" I compassionately say, "OK, just stay outside then." The same goes when she wants a cup of milk and I'm busy but one of her siblings offers to get it for her.

“I am hopeful that it will send a signal to friends and enemies in the region that the United States is committed to a secure and free Afghanistan,” McCain said.
The Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass (SATB) were dressed in dapper outfits, which along with their positioning reflected an air of superiority compared to their team. The Hackney Singers, Lewisham Choral Society and Forest Philharmonic came together yet religion is patriarchal and the SATB replicated the power that religion demands. Although many would disagree, the soprano’s red shoes among a stage in black and white gave a sinister feel to the godly image, furthermore when the all-in-black choir rose to sing, it depicted rows of dark angels.

You asked the working people to strike today. We all went to work. You wonder why your protests did not sway us? The majority of the working people that look at you do not see what you do. They see simply the indolent, the narcissistic, the immature, demanding free education while waiving your $500 electronic toys in the air as you destroy the property of someone who worked hard for it.

Just take an unwrapped Hershey's Kiss and dip it into melted chocolate chips. Then push it onto a Nutterbutter round cookie, take a chocolate chip and dip it into the melted chocolate and "glue" it onto the other side of the cookie.

(I can't find the original source of this recipe, there are many variations on the internet, if you know where the original idea came from I would be happy to give them credit.)
The first emperor, Emperor Jimmu, was a descendant of the goddess of the sun on his father’s side and the god of the sea on his mother’s. Those gods also had lineage. After the god Izanagi had returned from the underworld, he washed himself in the sea and shook them into existence off himself. Izanagi and the goddess Izanami had fallen in love and given birth to the eight main islands of ancient Japan. She died giving birth to yet another child. Heartbroken, Izanagi went down into the shadowy land of the dead to find her, but she had eaten of their food and now belonged to that world. Izanagi longed for her to return with him, but when he realised her flesh was rotten and was infested with maggots, he turned and fled. Izanami gave chase and was joined by the foul creatures of the underworld. Izanagi ran, casting aside anything he could think of in an effort to distract them and slow them down. He threw off his headdress, which transformed into grapes when it touched the ground. Out of his comb; bamboo. His hideous pursuers fell upon and devoured these. He urinated against a tree, producing a great river. This delayed them even more. Eventually he reached the entrance of the dark land of the dead and locked them all in with a great boulder. But Izanami, in her rage, swore vengeance on her former husband, and vowed to kill a thousand people a day as punishment for his abandoning of her. This is how Death was brought into existence. Even the gods are mortal.
Even if the outcome of the French trial is against him, Najib and family would be most welcome in Kazakhstan, which is ruled by an even more scandal-tainted dictator and where the Najibs have relatives by marriage.
But tentative struggles away from her own limited life do occur. Indeed, they are the key to the book, and are generally inspired by Mrs Bridge’s friend Grace Barron. “India, I’ve never been anywhere or done anything or seen anything. I don’t know how other people live, or think, even how they believe. Are we right? Do we believe the right things?” Mrs Bridge might be wary of pursuing such questions far herself, given the unhappiness such introspection brings Grace. “Have you ever felt like those people in the Grimm fairy tales – the ones who were all hollowed out in the back?”

Stories are to be about spring or renewal, at least, that’s what the contest rules say, though that does not mean the stories have to be upbeat or happy. You can work against the theme — contrasting a disaster that takes place in the spring with the beauty of the season, perhaps. Of course, up beat is good, too, it’s just that most of the writers I know (including me) don’t do upbeat.

I'm in New York! We made the flight last night with no delays (goodbye LaGuardia, hello Newark, my new bff) and settled into our hotel on the corner of Mercer and Prince.

On another level, respect is earned, not given, especially in a relationship. Men just expect women to give them respect; sorry guys, doesn’t work that way, and the same goes for women. Men and women shouldn’t just hand it out, people should have to work to earn respect. The same goes for trust. I think respect is among the top five most important things that seems to not exist anymore, and it’s seen that way everywhere. Whether it is at home, work, stores, events, etc. Even out in public at events, men will slap or antagonize women if they do anything the man considers ‘stepping out of line’ and feel the need to do something. But seriously guys, women and men both do stupid things, it’s part of being human. The other thing that annoys me to no end is the need of a trophy wife. Now some ask; what is a trophy wife? Well, the best way I can explain it is; it’s a wife who is extremely attractive and has to be so 24/7; has to maintain a lusted body and is pretty much required to praise her husband. To me, that is nearly the worst insult to a woman besides the control factor.
Like some kind of therapeutic He-Man, Hendrix fights the Power Struggle with Couples Dialogue. The steps involve mirroring (“so what you’re saying is, having my alcoholic best friend stay on our couch is not ideal?”); validation (“I can see how my alcoholic best friend’s presence on our sofa might displease you”); and empathy (“does my alcoholic friend here make you angry?”).
Gardener also twice ran in and won the 60m – an event in which he is the reigning world and European champion – recording times of 6.65sec and 6.63. Pickering posted a 60m personal best of 6.74 in the first race to finish ahead of Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, the 100m and 200m world youth champion. The tables were turned in the second race where Aikines-Aryeetey set a new personal best of 6.73 to finish second to Gardener with Pickering third in 6.77.
Some teens try desperately to fit in with their socially defined gender roles. This may cause them great emotional distress. Those who object to the idea of a gender identity disorder point out, particularly in the case of a transgender teen who may be exploring his or her sexual identity, the idea that they may have a mental illness and this reinforces the notion that “different is bad.”
We must be willing to look beyond the status quo to ensure we are making the most of available technology and resources to support and extend one of the most fundamental aspects of science: communication. At its most basic, communication is the simple act of sharing knowledge; at its most inspirational, it helps us to form our ideas about the world and leads to new concepts, understanding and applications.
Far better for Paddick to be straight-up with the electorate and say: ‘No, I can’t win under this current system but if you want to see future alternatives to this two-horse race vote for me now so that my higher vote can help brake the mould of this tweedledum / tweedledee politics next time around.’

Tomatoes are one of those vegetables that everyone stresses about growing. There are diseases and insects to worry about, birds will attach your fruit just before it's ready to pick, intense rains may cause blossom-end rot, and our hot weather will stop fruit production early in the summer. With all these issues, we debated about presenting tomatoes as this month's gardening project. But home-grown tomatoes are so far superior to what is available for purchase, we think it's worth the challenge. And, we're going to try to keep it very simple for the novice gardener so that you're guaranteed to succeed.

So when you thought that your country was still at the cutting edge of freedom and democracy in this turbulent world, you were wrong. The democracy you thought you had just simply does not exist. You have lost the right to free speech, your towns and cities are filled with rainbow people and those in power have consolidated their position by ensuring that any person speaking out is deluged under the epithet ‘Racist’. The EU is busy determining where in Britain they will build the new slum tenements and towns to house the hundreds of thousands of ethnic persons who will be encouraged to come to do the jobs that the average Britain will not do. You cannot speak out about it because under the ‘ New Democracy’ you will be charged with inciting racial hatred. Yes, it is true, democracy no longer exists in Britain, like most things it is just a distant memory of what we had in the past so forget about voting for your favourite politician and instead go to the pub. The results will be just the same.
The song "You Were Loved" came out in 1996, but it meant the most to me in November 1999. It was the song that was playing in the background of our wedding slideshow. I hope this is a song that made her feel special in her life, especially during her darkest, darkest moments. I hope she listened to the words herself. Judging from this picture of her with her daughter, Bobbi Kristina, and the response of millions everywhere, there is no doubt that Whitney Houston was loved.

Okay? Everybody clear on this? The Emperor Nero. He persecuted a cartload of Christians, and after he died there were all these rumors he was coming back with an army from the east to stomp on the righteous. Nero was the guy I was writing about.

Beckett was the first of the absurdists to win international fame. His works have been translated into over twenty languages. In 1969 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. He continued to write until his death in 1989, but the task grew more and more difficult with each work until, in the end, he said that each word seemed to him "an unnecessary stain on silence and nothingness."
What would Dickens write today? I think he would be greatly fascinated by the Internet: what it does to human selfhood and to relationships, how it is both a means to something and an end in itself. He would be struck, too, by the new forms of capitalism in place today: the financial bubbles of mortgages, derivatives and real estate, the networks of economic connection propelled by globalization and the field of economic desire that trails us wherever we go (he could stay with the titles Great Expectations and Hard Times).
I heard a literary agent joke that to make your villain more believable all you need to do is give him/her a pet. An axe murder who loves his pet guinea pig can’t be all bad, right? Give your villain a heart – or at least make them care about someone or something passionately. Know what has driven him/her to do bad things. Alternatively give your hero a dirty little secret or a dark side.
There are three main differences between Term Life Insurance and Whole Life Insurance coverage. First is the primary purpose of the coverage. Is it to be a protection or investment? Term policies are primarily used for protection while whole life policies are used as investment vehicles. Second is the amount of time the policy covers. Term life is a specified timeframe designated by the term. Whole life policies cover you throughout your life and never have to be renewed. Third is the price to benefit ratio. Term life policies are almost always less expensive but generally carry a higher death benefit whereas whole life policies have smaller death benefits with higher price tags.

I remember when I first started reading blogs and I discovered Paris Parfait. I used to lurk and admire, too shy to leave a comment (why in the world would she want to hear from me?) and enjoy her photos of Paris to give me endless daydreams. And then I started coming more and more for the writing and the poems and the wonderful intellect behind the words.
And boy did I get nervous and flustered on Day 2. It was the getting-to-know-you day. The day that you're brought around and introduced to everyone, and you have to make small talk. Needless to say, small talk is not my forté, and I usually avoid it like the plague because it makes me so uncomfortable. I wish I could have avoided it on Day 2, because every time I opened my mouth, I felt like a blithering idiot. As the day went on, I got more and more self-conscious about what I was saying and how much I was sweating and how red I was getting and how hot I was ... and you get the picture.

Fall colour blocking is something I think that marketing people made up. Seriously, it's just wearing fall colours and not prints. All fall colours go together, so group all the wines, oranges and browns together (toss some yellow in there too, and some dark purple if the mood takes you, and don't forget to add some olive). Whatever floats your boat.

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, owners of the Chevrolet Volt with XM satellite radio installed can’t pick up the Fox station and after some complaints were received by GM from loyal Fox News audience, the recall became a possibility. We won’t say anything about “life threating situations, injuries or crashes” related to this incident because this is not the case. Owners of the Chevy Volt, with the XM satellite radio installed, will be notified soon by the car manufacturer, and they will have to take a trip back to the dealers where the problem will be solved free of charge.

Shoot, if I’m making this much money and you’re the one who made it happen, would you be willing to come to the party? I’d love to have you visit and finally get a chance meet you. Obviously, being a man of the Lord, you’re not suppose to defile your body so I wouldn’t expect that you’d want any tattoos. I’d be willing to invite all of your favorite celebrities, just let me know who they are (I would assume Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Ellen). I’m really looking forward to this. Can you please send me your name, address and phone number so I can purchase a plane ticket for you to come join the party? Do you have any frequent flier memberships? I’ll be sure to get you a flight on one of the airlines you have a membership with so you get the miles (you’ll also need to give me your membership number).

It may be the teacher. Socrates is famous for his elenctic method which I consider a prime example of education in its most Latinate meaning – to lead or draw out from. The teacher leads the student to the conclusion the teacher wants the student to accept by drawing the student out with a series of structured (leading) questions. It seems like the student is engaged in a meaningful intellectual exercise but it is, in fact, carefully choreographed and completely controlled by the teacher.

Let’s be fair: the English themselves are guilty of nicknames, too: “Princess Di” and “Fergie,” for starters. In their tabloids, Michael Jackson was gleefully rechristened “Wacko Jacko,” Madonna is "Madge"; Paul McCartney, “Mac,” David Beckham, "Becks."
Fasting does not always have to mean food; it may mean other things we enjoy, such as television. But by choosing to give up something temporal in order to pursue something eternal, we make it possible for the Lord to reveal Himself more powerfully to us. And to the degree that we allow ourselves to hunger after God, to that degree we will be satisfied by Him and experience His joy.

“Sister, its never too early to start learning your math” was the reply. I from there developed a love for math and my uncle was heartbroken to learn that I was going to study law. He didn’t talk to me for almost a year after that. I got him equation shaped chocolate cookies as bribe before he spoke to me again. This was the first time I would be hearing from him this year.
Life may not be fair at times, but you will have to learn to fight through it and in the end it will all turn out alright. Do what you love and never let others tell you what you should be doing. Always remember that although life will be a struggle, it’s ok to go out there and have fun from time to time. It will keep you sane.
Jacob is one of the sweetest boys you will ever meet. He is also a child who struggles on a daily basis with reading, comprehension, writing and grammar. Since kindergarten, I have been in constant contact with the WONDERFUL teachers Jacob has been fortunate to have, from classroom teachers to the special in-school help he receives. Since Jacob’s kindergarten year, both his teachers and I have requested, through the school district, testing for any learning disabilities. Finally, after a previous letter I wrote at the beginning of this school year, demanding the testing be done, I was told (and signed paperwork stating) Jacob would be tested by the school district. Before I go any further, I want it known that this letter is in NO WAY aimed at Lighthouse Elementary and everyone at the school whom have gone above and beyond helping Jacob. This letter is being solely addressed at the Palm Beach County School System.
It may surprise you to find out that the language “personal relationship with Jesus” does not appear in the New Testament. In fact, as Mark Luepke recently pointed out, the word “personal” doesn't really appear in the News Testament. Yes, my NIV uses the term “a trusted personal servant of the king” to describe a man named Blastus (Acts 12:20) and has Jesus talk about those who “gain personal glory” (John 7:18). Nut more literal translations (NASB, ESV) don’t use the word “personal” at all. It’s a bit surprising that this “personal relationship with Christ” mantra of modern Christianity just isn’t found in the New Testament.
There is enough power in the blood of Jesus to take care of, not only the worst sinner that ever lived, but everyone that ever lived combined. If you’re one of those that believe you’ve messed up so bad and for so long, I’m telling you that you’re wrong. There is no sin that you’ve ever been involved in that is greater than the power that’s been invested in the blood of Jesus to cleanse you. His blood can transform you into a Beautiful Saint of the Most High God. He can fix whatever we’ve messed up in our lives. That’s why we need to cheer Heaven because our Champion has released His blood so that we could get another shot at getting this thing called Life right.
For our boast (NASB has “proud confidence”) is this, the testimony of our conscience, that we behaved in the world with simplicity and godly sincerity, not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God, and supremely so toward you.

Miike starts the film with long steady takes building up a picture of Aoyama’s life – it is stable, he is a good father and decent chap. Within different conversations themes of loneliness, ageing, inter-generational differences and the recession are all touched upon. However the course of the film takes us uncomfortably close to the exploitation of women.
Whenever I plan on going to another country or a trip within the U.S. I always look for an opportunity to visit the national parks. The first reason why is because a smart traveler is not only looking for good deals, but they are also looking for the most scenic destinations in the world. You will definitely find that this preserved area was chosen for the beauty that it possesses. It will bring you back to what the world was like before humans decided to take over every square inch of land to build something on it.

A 340-year-old Bible has been discovered tucked away in a pantry-sized room filled with old books, historical records and pamphlets at a 148-year-old Lutheran church and school located in Wisconsin. Middle school teacher Debra Court first found the Bible two years ago, while searching for baptism records for a class. When she saw it she thought it was just an old book and didn’t think much about it, according to FOX news. "I was looking for the old baptism records to show my students and then up here in the corner was where the Bible was tucked," said Court.
she bounced and cheered and screamed.

Next we heard from Alice Kleinsman about "Heart Centred Parenting". She's a registered classical homeopath, certified NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) practitioner and life coach. I found what she shared to be quite inspiring, although a bit rushed. She quickly took us through the basics of what she works through with people in the 6 week course she runs. She had one hour with us, so you can imagine how condensed it was! There were 3 main areas: the "Having Values" wheel, where you write down the keys ways you enjoy to meet your own emotional needs onto a wheel chart divided into segments. It included things like spiritual practice, relationships, health, security, beauty, art & creativity, companionship etc.... The idea was to write down the key things that matter to you, and then for each one to mark down how close to the centre of your life it currently is. We need to be having at least one key area fairly close to the centre, to be finding some emotional fulfilment from it's practice.

The benefits of drinking coffee has also been linked to the reduction of developing Type 2 diabetes, although researchers have warned that the research is still in its infancy stages, and has yet to pass randomized trials. A study published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease has also suggested that coffee seems to have an interesting property capable of preventing Alzheimer’s disease, although this remains debatable as the research was done on mice. The same journal also published another article praising coffee for lowering the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease by 25%.

When I was in school I had no interest in school work.� It was something that I needed to do to try to obtain high marks so I can go study more, blah blah blah.� I had no interest in history, reading, researching, occult, politics etc, but now something has happened.� I feel like I need to do something.� Anything.� But what?� The only thing I can really do is share information.� Share consciousness.� Weather you choose to read the information or choose to use it or not use it is entirely up to you.� I can’t just sit here and see injustice take a seat on the throne of justice.� Information is the most important way for people to make a decision, if that information is corrupt, the decision and the outcome of that corrupt information may have greater implications. Why would anyone want to distribute lies?� The main answer to that is money.� It is scary to see the implications of money and its capitalistic system.� The problem with going up against capitalism is that you automatically get labelled a socialist, communist and even unpatriotic.� We must remember that every story has 2 sides to it.� It is not wrong to explore both sides of the story.� I think what has happened now is that a lot of people are either 1) too distracted with life to care 2) authority scares them into thinking one side of the story is wrong and anyone who thinks otherwise is an enemy of state or 3) We just don’t care and we think “That’s life!”� Wrong.� This is NOT life.

I have been to several national and international leadership conferences in the past year and am sick to find out the statistics of the youth culture—79% of children who grew up in Christian homes leave their Christian faith when they go to college. The appalling statistics of youth who are still virgins by the age of 17 is beyond comprehension. These were just statistics to me until they started turning up in my basement–our kids rec room–friends of my children who had grown up in church and some in homeschool groups who were in tears, confessing to my boys that they were sleeping with their Christian girlfriends and didn't know how to stop and feeling guilty. With the rampant sexuality on tv and on the web and the immoral standards of movies, and the leisure time that children have with other children who are not monitored in their homes–and in your neighborhood, I must say—puts pressure on your children to want to conform and places temptation in their pathway. So the question of schools or not depends on what peers they will become heart connected to–what morals the people in the school have, how emotionally attached they become to those in the school that could lead their heart astray.

Please, don’t tell me how I should eat, when I should eat, what size portions, how infrequently/frequently, yadda yadda. I understand nutrition better than most and because of everything I’ve learned, I don’t believe in fad diets (when I say “fad” I include Weight Watchers in this) because I just believe in eating healthy (nutritionally as well as portion control) and I like it, it makes me happy and it makes my body feel good. And sure, I have off days where I eat something that I don’t normally eat and let me tell you, my body pays for it. But, that’s none of your business. All I ask is to leave me alone and maybe direct your outwardly focus inwardly. I’m not calling out that big doughy breadstick you tried to pretend to eat only a bite of, then half until you polished it off, the 2 refills of diet coke you’ve gulped down or the “healthy” salad you brought to that pot luck filled with sugar.

In terms of live entertainment, there was also an al fresco ring where fighters competed for the honor of the festival Muay Thai champion title. (And yes, pop culture/ reality TV junkies, Muay Thai is that full contact combat sport (similar to kickboxing) that you last saw on an episode of The Bachelorette.) In fact the name apparent roughly means "Art of Eight Limbs" because you engage with fists, elbows, legs and knees (eight points of contact). Festival attendees gathered to look on as the 'streetfighters' battled it out in the ring.
