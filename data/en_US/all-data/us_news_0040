I hope my apology and mea culpa are accepted, as they're certainly sincere.

My 10 minutes alone in the temple was a rare, heavenly experience.

In fact, they have already released two albums, both of which went number one in their home country of Ireland. They were even selected to represent Ireland at the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest, with one of the catchiest songs I've heard in awhile, "Lipstick." Once again, the vocals were horrible, but something about the whole stage performance got Europe to vote for Jedward, once again proving that just because you can't sing doesn't mean you don't have the X Factor.

No prominent Democrat has stepped forward to run against him, even as a protest. It may be that, by beginning gradual withdrawals of American combat troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, Mr. Obama has assuaged the feelings of this important segment of the party.

Details of the president's proposal will be worked out over the next couple of months as a congressional supercommittee tries to cut the deficit by more than $1 trillion over the next decade. But, ultimately, attitudes about the president's plan will come down to individual farmers. A farmer who spends thousands of dollars to irrigate a crop, for example, is less prone to drought damage. So, in theory, that farmer cares more about direct payments than crop insurance that would guard against lack of rain.

Like the service, the room can be a touch abrasive. The cinderblock wall filled with a ton of empty picture frames (apparently some kind of evocation of an Italian family basement or a dive bar) is like the design-equivalent of a comedian bombing on stage.

Notes: Thompson suffered a shoulder injury last spring and had surgery. He also has undergone surgery for an appendectomy. It would seem unlikely the two procedures would have anything to do with him having a heart attack. ... Riley noted Thursday that Thompson had gone through some difficult physical issues to reach the point where he would be scrapping for a spot in the defensive line rotation when spring ball starts March 12. (There are three practices before spring break). ... "I was so proud of him. He's come a long way since he got here,'' said Riley. "I just enjoyed being around him. He had that great, great smile. Everybody liked Fred, is the best way to say it. He was a big 'ol guy. Fun to be around. ... he was like the perfect teammate.''

Nurses act as a sort of liaison or interpreter, helping the patient by speaking to them in terms they can understand. A nurse turns a physician’s direction to "keep the patient NPO r/t N/V and give 4 mg Zofran" into "the patient is to not eat or drink (nothing by mouth) related to their nausea and vomiting and give 4 mg of Zofran," which is an anti-nausea medication."

Again, the works are scattered about, and you have to pass by shops and gambling rooms to see them, but again, they're free and high-quality. The Cosmo does two things right. It's committed to video art, which isn't traditional, but fits in well with a city where lights are known to flash and signs are meant to move. It commissioned a piece from artist Leo Villareal and has shown works by T.J. Wilcox and Yoko Ono.

— CULTURE AND ARTS: Don't worry, the debt crisis isn't going to shut down the Louvre in Paris or the Vienna State Opera House. Culture will play a central role in European life for the foreseeable future. But how much of it should be financed by the government? That's a question being asked in many European capitals as budgets are being tightened. As part of its austerity drive, Spain's new conservative government has eliminated the Culture Ministry as a self-standing institution, merging it with education and sports. A program to subsidize Spanish cinema — which made a name for itself around the world with Oscar-winning directors such Pedro Almodovar — has been scrapped. In Sweden, the government has decided to gradually dismantle a subsidy program that provided lifelong income guarantees for artists seen as particularly important to Swedish culture.

My wife's Garlic-Marinated Grilled Hanger Steak ($25), one of several new dishes on the recently updated seasonal menu, is a unique cold-weather creation. Tasty slices of beef rest on a bed of roasted root vegetables bathed in a rich red-wine syrup flavored by fresh thyme. My only complaint was that the beef was not as tender as other hanger steaks I have had. I could chalk that up to it having been cooked past the medium-rare doneness requested.
It's a knock on the door that other California residents could soon receive. The state's plan to isolate huanglongbing includes the mandatory removal and destruction of infected citrus trees and mandatory spraying of insecticides in areas 400 to 800 meters around the infected trees.
Indeed, for the past decade, Johnson's been assembling an unusual, wry and approachable discourse on contemporary black identity and the urge to shake off dreary, dated expectations — or as the writer Toure says of Johnson's work in the show's catalog, "It's about the freedom to be Black however you want to be." One self-portrait in the MCA show, for instance, shows Johnson lying across the tomb of boxing legend Jack Johnson in Graceland Cemetery. The message, like the message in much of Johnson's art, is vague, and vaguely provocative. Take this however you like, he seems to be saying — funny, caustic, reverential.

He is especially strong near the play's end, when the depth of his personal sacrifice becomes most clear.
Mullen also enjoyed a fine three-year varsity career in football, playing defensive back, wide receiver and running back. he was recruited more heavily to play that sport in college, but basketball is what he enjoys most, and when the Naval Academy came calling for him to play hoops, he jumped at the chance.

Yet the near disappearance of tuberculosis from the Western world, where it was once the greatest killer of all, owes little to streptomycin.

At Calvin Klein, Mr. Zucchelli hit upon the idea of making foam clothing after seeing a book of works by John Chamberlain, an artist who worked with foam sculptures. At a trade show in September in Europe, he came across a booth set up by a manufacturer of foam used to cushion bike seats. It hadn't been used in clothing. It took six months from start to finish to create the foam clothes for Calvin Klein, "the longest it's ever taken" to make goods, compared to two weeks for a typical item, Mr. Zucchelli says.

Meanwhile, little effort is made to address the strong correlation between socio-economic status and student achievement in the U.S.

Can you explain why the Bears refuse to give D.J. Moore a chance to play on the outside? It can't be because of his height since he's actually taller than Tim Jennings, the incumbent opposite Peanut. And I can't imagine that Jennings is much faster than Moore, if at all. Plus, D.J. is a much bigger playmaker than Jennings, who drops many more potential interceptions than he holds on to. I'm afraid that Moore might leave when he becomes a free agent because Lovie won't let him spread his wings as a legit outside corner and not just a nickelback. Reggie Carolina, St. Paul, Minn.

It makes no sense, except in one place in the world, the place where it started, on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming.

There are kids, marriages, jobs, nights of drinking, heterosexual flings, in-laws and holidays to celebrate, and they do everything they're expected to do, but numb. Then every so often, they meet back up on the mountain and get to be themselves for a few stolen days. The situation carries a lot of emotional power, largely because it's so specific and yet undefined. The two guys -- cowboys -- are in love with each other, but we don't ever quite know if they're in love with each other because they're gay, or if they're gay because they're in love with each other.
