To help their cause, the Bulls also made a move of their own on Wednesday. They got a free-agent commitment from former Cav Carlos Boozer, locking him up to a five-year deal worth a reported $75 million. The Bulls left just enough salary cap space to add James at the maximum salary.

Madonna, in her Super Bowl week press conference, promised there would be no wardrobe malfunction. But did she know that this was going to happen? If so, why didn't she stop it? If not, how did it get in there?
"It would be like spitting into the wind at this point - it's just part of the national lexicon," says Bridget MacConnell, a Kraft spokeswoman. "We all try to protect the value of our brands. But this one just kind of got away from us. I don't think there was any way to fight it."

Someone on the staff (that would be me) had the brilliant idea for a punch. And no one does punch quite like Martin Cate, owner of Forbidden Island Tiki Lounge in Alameda.

Yesterday Rutgers WR Mohamed Sanu announced he will be forgoing his senior year to enter the 2012 NFL Draft. For most of us, the decision for the 23 year old record breaking receiver was a no brainer. However, the Rutgers fan inside of all of us, still held on to a slimmer of hope that he might come back. In the end, the sport is too violent of a game to take chances especially for a player who handled the ball over 350 times in his three year career as a receiver, runner and return man for the Scarlet Knights.
The millage request was approved in the city's 10 precincts, and among absentee voters. Of 1,007 absentee ballots cast, 651 were yes votes and 356 were nay votes.

"We think we can do it without making it a flagship," the administrator said. "This country has made its role as a leader in exploration by flagship missions. That's something we have to do.

Carole Jurack, 71, of Chardon, placed third with her photograph titled "Lady in Red." "I'm always looking for fresh new ways to take creative images of exquisite flowers," she said. "Sometimes just getting up close to the flower is all the incentive one needs to see the flower in a unique way within its environment. 'Lady in Red' provided a dynamic and flamboyant background pattern complementing the strong color and form of the flower."

Last week's half-hour lesson was about dealing with people who say hurtful things. McMahon used a book with large illustrations that talked about a little girl named Jayla who said something mean to her classmate, Jevonne.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. – The team has matched the worst start in franchise history.

That made Wallace's contributions with the second unit stand out even more. According to Pistons' TV statistician Joe Abramson, Wallace was plus-nine on the floor against the Lakers.

Socha, a Catholic, is hardly a Jewish sympathizer. But he is aware of the atrocities going on all around him -- while running through the woods he and Szczepek see soldiers herding a group of terrified, naked women through the trees, then killing them. Holland shoots the scene in a sickish blue, the women's skin giving them the appearance that they are already dead. Degradations -- and worse -- occur on the streets every day.
This isn't Love's first foray into visual art, strictly speaking. She made a memorable appearance in Francesco Vezzoli's "Trailer for a Remake of Gore Vidal's Caligula." (She played Caligula.)

In the second case, from Michigan, Anthony Cooper was charged with attempted murder and was willing to admit his guilt. But, relying on advice from his lawyer, he turned down an offer from a prosecutor to plead guilty in exchange for a recommended sentence of between five and seven years in prison. His lawyer had told him he could not be convicted of intent to murder because he had fired a gun at a woman's legs, not above her waist — an assertion that was flatly wrong, as a matter of law and common sense.

But a Commerce Department spokesman said officials acted quickly merely because SolarWorld's coalition alleged an import surge in its initial complaint instead of adding the charge later.

But McCain's political prospects grew bleaker over the weekend when Sen. Bob Bennett, a fellow Republican veteran, was tossed aside by Utah conservatives at the state party convention.

• ABC reality shows "The Bachelor" and "The Bachelorette" have a pretty dismal track record when it comes to lasting relationships. After a combined 23 seasons, only one couple -- Trista and Ryan Sutter -- is married. Now it looks as if the contestants' bad luck has rubbed off on host Chris Harrison. A report appearing Thursday at www.people.com said that Harrison and his wife, Gwen, are separating after 18 years of marriage and two children. Harrison is hosting the eighth season of "The Bachelorette," which premieres May 14 on ABC.

Splitting the final Potter volume into two films was also to the advantage of Part 2, as was the fact that this film deals only with roughly the final third of the book. This enables it to avoid the tiresome teen angst that hampered Part 1 and devote almost all its time to action and confrontation, starting with the film's initial image of the dread Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) pointing the all-powerful Elder Wand to the sky and creating ... the Warner Bros. logo.
Early closure is identified through an exam by your pediatrician; however, the fontanelle can be open, though not detectable by physical exam. Early closure can be normal, but head circumference has to be carefully monitored. If your child's head circumference begins to fall below expected values, for example, head circumference was in the 50th percentile at birth and later is at the 10th percentile, then further evaluation is required to rule out medical causes for abnormal closure.

The ultimate decision on these reforms doesn't rest with the Legislature. Because they involve changes to the state Constitution, they must be approved by voters. (Brown needs the approval of two-thirds of the Legislature to get a measure on the November ballot.) It's also important to note that although Republicans seem to have seen the light now, they would have been far more effective had they been willing to compromise on a budget deal last summer, when Democrats might have agreed to put pension reforms on the ballot if Republicans had allowed voters to decide on tax hikes. No matter. By standing up for good government, Golden State Republicans are making themselves relevant again, and putting needed pressure on Democrats to address an important matter.

Faulk was a human sponge Friday in Canton, soaking up everything about his Hall of Fame experience, an experience he already described as surreal. Along with past Hall of Fame members, he took part Friday morning in a groundbreaking ceremony for an expansion project.
"This allows us to get to the scene so much quicker," said Assistant Chief Steve Brown. "Ninety-seven percent of the time when a truck responds out of the Main Street station, it has to make a left-hand turn, go down Main Street and cross the (Mid Rivers Mall Drive) overpass. Taking the overpass section out of the equation shaves over a minute of the average response time."

The shooting was the 15th incident this year in which Afghan soldiers or insurgents disguised in military uniforms have turned their weapons on foreign troops.

"This incident should not have happened in the first place. If China is really a country with rule of law, then how could a local government use illegal tactics to hold a person under house arrest for so long? This incident might prompt high-level officials in charge of so-called `stability maintenance' to stop further restricting activists after they have been released from prison, because this will generate public attention and the activists will escape and seek help from foreign embassies. I hope the authorities will learn these lessons from this incident."

7) Ruination. Part of the strategy for luring tourism to the Costa Maya was to excavate and open more of the southern coast's little-known Maya sites to tourism. Kohunlich, discovered by a local Maya in 1967 outside the state capital of Chetumal, lacks grandeur but offers a parklike setting and continuing excavations. It is best known for the haunting Temple of the Masks, actually 6-foot elongated plaster faces from about A.D. 500. Travelers going to Chacchoben, a short distance from the coast highway just north of the Mahahual turnoff, have a unique opportunity to see the ancient city through a native's eyes. Ivan Cohuo, whose father father started a farm near the site in 1940, grew up with the pyramids as his playground. Cohuo and his partner, David Villagomez, a flora and fauna expert whose grandmother was a midwife in Chacchoben village, now lead tours there and also offer tours of their home village.

A number of studies have found, contrary to long-held belief, that coffee consumption may aid cardiovascular health and reduce strokes. The few other studies of coffee consumption and depression have focused largely on men, or on people who committed suicide. Those largely linked caffeine consumption with lower rates of depression and suicide. But since women are twice as likely to suffer depression as men (yet far less likely to take their own lives), the authors of the current study argued that understanding how caffeine affects women specifically is important.
"Here it was the tombstones of the three people that sold Emmert the property," Engelke said. The stones intended to mark the graves of Henry Hayes and two of his family member somehow ended up as the floor of a barn. Today they are resting on the property once owned by Hayes. As for the bodies?

State law requires districts to first use seniority when laying off teachers. Jackson's plan would allow the Cleveland district to focus on student achievement and the teacher's area of specialty in determining whom to lay off. The bill, if passed the way Jackson envisions it, would pertain only to mayor-controlled districts in Ohio, so it would only apply only to Cleveland.
Whitaker scored again, booting a 37-yard field goal after Stanford put together a 7-play, 36-yard drive that started after Oregon's De'Anthony Thomas fumbled, and lasted 3:16, cutting the Ducks' lead to 15-9.
Because North American ash trees did not evolve alongside the emerald ash borer, an Asian native, the trees have no resistance to EAB attacks. Moreover, natural limiting factors of the non-native borers, Asian predators and pathogens, remain thousands of miles away. Biological controls—typically imported predators of emerald ash borer—are being studied, but such biological measures carry risks and few experts believe the methods will have a significant impact on emerald ash borer populations.
Last year, Hammond clinched a share of its first county title with a 17-12 win at Howard in the last week of the regular season. This year, Howard hopes to get some redemption.
Flynn, a 31-year-old West Linn-Wilsonville School District teacher, thinks the board can benefit from an educator's perspective. He said he could give other board members a clearer idea of what is happening within classrooms, and how different decisions would actually affect schools.

I felt I had to steer the conversation away from Yuri and Victor. "Let me show you around the loft, at least," I said.

The most unusual, and certainly the most challenging, was the power runner, a brutal machine that turns the quadriceps to mush in a matter of seconds. Many, I'd guess, also will struggle with the five running portions, two-minute sessions of charging back and forth with a huge elastic band around your waist, tugging backward.
Citrus: Some homeowners completely ignore their citrus trees and get perfect fruit. Others have problems, getting small fruit, weak yields and discolored leaves. It most likely depends on the soil.

The setup is hokey and contrived. Why can't I attack and defend at the same time? And like the main game, it only recognizes certain gestures at certain times. When you are defending, "Duels of Fate" won't let you jump over your opponent and it may not recognize when you kick or use your Force power on him.

Entering Tuesday night's NBA draft lottery, the Pistons were slotted seventh -- like last season.
Granted, Kennedy and Roberts treated with excessive respect the contention that the law's insurance requirement represents an apocalyptic departure from established constitutional principles. But, on reflection, those justices may still conclude that it would be overreaching to thwart Congress in an area — the regulation of commerce — in which the court has generally deferred to the legislative branch since the 1930s. Whether or not it was outmatched forensically, the administration in its argument offered ample reason for the justices to uphold the act.

Despite sanctions, up to a half million Cuban Americans fly to their ethnic homeland annually. Speculation about a possible oil bonanza in Cuba might cause us to look at the embargo differently. It may take something that dramatic for sanctions to end and for U.S. cruise ships to dock in Havana Harbor. Meanwhile, one wonders if Washington realizes who is paying the real price.

Some students dug samples from different spots across Purdue's campus, others pulled mud from the banks of the nearby Wabash River. Czyszczon, remembering a Bedford, Ind., cave she had passed on a recent family trip to Kentucky, decided she'd take her sample from underground.

The Innovation C may look like it was designed for intergalactic space travel, but the chair can complement grand, traditional spaces as well. (I first came across these chairs in the centuries-old, medieval Salaborsa Library in Bologna, Italy, where they dot the periphery of the ground floor.) Its novel shape—essentially two parallel planes—also happens to be practical. What's most innovative about Innovation C is its open-endedness. Instead of a vertical seat back, Innovation C's goes horizontal, offering a comfortable place to rest your elbows when you're leaning back (no bulky armrests required). Swivel the chair around so the seat back is in front of you and you've got a surface on which to rest your laptop or book (it's set at the perfect height for working) or lean on while making a phone call. $4,525, blastation.com

But now, a bridge that puts so much focus on motor vehicle traffic is passé. This is 2012, and we need to be prioritizing individual health and sustainable transportation. It is shameful that the bridge district, when making needed repairs to the west sidewalk, refused to take one lane of auto traffic - out of six - for bicyclists.
"New Girl" is on a break: The Zooey Deschanel comedy, "New Girl" has been a hit for Fox, but the show is nevertheless off the schedule until November. Say what? As the Los Angeles Times reports, scheduling conflicts with the baseball playoffs and expanded editions of "The X Factor" in October, pushed "New Girl," and the other Tuesday shows, "Glee" and "Raising Hope," off until next month. This is kind of a bummer, since "New Girl" has done well for Fox, and "The X Factor" seems to already be suffering from episode bloat.

It would be logical in many ways for those left in the Big 12 to join with those that will be left in the crumbling Big East, add a couple of schools like Houston to the mix and make a go of it.

5. Forward Josh McRoberts: As of now, Hill currently has replaced McRoberts as the backup power forward that provides hustle plays. McRoberts' fluctuating role provides one of many examples where Brown's constant lineup shuffling has stifled the reserves' development. As much as it would be nice for McRoberts to expand his shooting arsenal, that wasn't necessarily his role. So he'll have to stay ready to push the pace, dive for loose balls and crash the glass should he get back in the rotation.

Bozmans likely will accept an invitation to run in the Adidas "Dream 100" for high school runners in New York in early June, and there also is a chance he could compete in the U.S. Olympic Trials in Eugene, Ore.

Most Republican candidates embrace nativism and deny the states any role in relaxing immigration restrictions and revising the "drug war," as do the Obama administration and its union backers with their hostility to any guest worker program. The Republicans have lashed themselves to the law enforcement establishment in insisting on criminalization rather than testing as a drug-control strategy, lately joined by the Obama administration, oblivious to the fact that drugs and related criminal records have negated, for much of the black population, gains that would otherwise have resulted from the civil rights movement.

A: We wanted residents to learn the skills of organic farming. It first started in 2009 and it's grown. We get applications in December and start training in February. We've got a partnership with North County Tech to use one of their greenhouses. Right now, we've got 37 apprentices with 32 of them in their first year. You can make some money with organic farming by selling produce at a farmers market. It takes a lot of work, though.

Most of his life, my father struggled mightily with bigotry. And I do mean it when I say he struggled, because the older I got, the more he saw what his views were doing to my view of him. That hurt him, and me, and for years the only thing we knew to do was yell about it.

They also might ask themselves if they know what they are in for.
Flavors include chocolate, lemon and vanilla. Although our tasters enjoyed all the varieties, chocolate was the hands-down favorite not only for the flavor, but for consistency. There was a hint of graininess (a familiar texture in many GF baked goods) in the lemon cookie. A 8.5-ounce package costs $4.99 and contains 12 cookies.

At Soul Flavors, the biscuits are baked to Southern perfection, sturdy little numbers that miraculously collapse like clouds when you bite them. The menu marquees a number of classics -- buttermilk fried chicken, fried catfish, barbecued ribs. But Lyons also highlights his lamb pot pie and curried pumpkin risotto. And his philosophy, even when preparing traditional dishes, is modern. He shuns processed ingredients, makes his own sauces, fries his chicken in peanut oil, uses less fatty cuts of meat and refuses to pile the plate with outsized portions. The evolution of soul food provokes tricky dinner conversation. To be sure, culinary evolution is one of those touchy subjects that swirl around any cuisine. Take Italian-American food, for example, itself a poor-cousin bastardization of the food of Italy. But try to modernize your Brooklyn grandma's veal parm recipe and see how popular you are next Thanksgiving.
Once your own imagination has been sparked, you can try your hand at rolling, folding, decoupaging and papier maché-ing printed pages into all manner of creative objects.

Kaner's wine list is restricted to those that go with oysters. He doesn't have the space to do as much with wine as he does at Covell. It's a storage issue.

As you can see, I'm trying to find excuses for leaving out some restaurants, because in other years the second 10 might easily have made it into the Top 10. And here's another cop-out: I'm not listing them in order of preference but rather in order of review date, from earliest to latest. Most of the Top 10 restaurants opened this year, although a few, such as Perbacco, opened in late 2006, but the reviews couldn't be published until 2007 because of The Chronicle's three-visit policy.

But first, ODOT needs to take another look at its priority list. How can it downgrade replacing a bridge its own engineers say has major structural problems? How can it justify more uncertainty in the heart of Ohio's most populous region? How can it ignore the needs of an interstate highway that has to go above a massive river valley? Getting the Inner Belt done as quickly as possible isn't parochialism, it's common sense -- and this region must make that crystal clear to Columbus.

He was brilliant in the regular-season and now he looks like he has temporarily lost his mojo. He's given up 17 goals in 84 shots. That's a hideous .798 save percentage. He hasn't made the big save when they have most needed it.

The parking lot would be paved at the elementary school and a gravel emergency road put in at the back of the school. At the high school, plans call for roof repairs and upgrading heating, alarm and sprinkler systems.

Company speakers stressed that they believe the technical issues surrounding plug-ins are manageable, as long as work is done now to prepare for the large number of plug-in vehicles expected to be on the road within 10 years.
-- Arizona, 5th overall pick: The Cardinals have two young QBs in Max Hall and John Skelton, and head coach Ken Whisenhunt seems to like Hall. But enough to bypass Gabbert? Moreover, the Cardinals might bring in a veteran (Marc Bulger?) to hold the position until the future starter is ready. In that scenario, Gabbert would fit.
There’s a sharp high/low element running through this season’s “Justified.” Quarles has a plan to produce oxycontin in Kentucky, sell some locally and ship half the pills back to Detroit. “That’s why they call it organized crime,” he explains to the easily cowed Duffy, who searches for the bathroom in Quarles’ house and finds a man bound and gagged in a bedroom. It looks a little like a visual reference to another movie criminals love, “Pulp Fiction,” that becomes more explicit when the next scene is in a pawn shop. The crooked owner is using addicts to sell “hillbilly heroin,” and makes them grovel and play Harlan roulette, spinning the cylinder more than once.
But I do know that Bon Scott will be singing "Highway to Hell" at the Beachland Ballroom, 15711 Waterloo Road, Cleveland. Or at least, a dude trying to be him.

Two years later, Target Field opened, and the neighborhood bloomed as more commercial and residential projects followed the ballpark's lead.

All are served by the nearby Hiawatha light rail and Northstar commuter rail lines.

Part of the reason is to attract more men. Typically, the E! audience runs 60-40 percent female, and Kolb would like to even that out a little more. That's also some of the thinking behind a more "gender-neutral" design of network graphics that will debut on the same day of "Opening Act," Kolb said. Men are also more interested in E!'s topical programming like "The Soup," and Cummings' new series will follow "The Soup" on Wednesday nights.
San Francisco seat: The study "is an important step in the right direction.

Efforts typically are made to assure balance. Kelly and Helfrich said the plan this year likely would call for a draft by position so that each team is guaranteed equitable talent.

Only Shalom Auslander would call a novel "Hope: A Tragedy." But then, what else would you expect from an author whose last book, a memoir, was titled "Foreskin's Lament"? There, he recalled his Orthodox Jewish upbringing, detailing his sense of God as not consoling but malevolent, a cosmic bully. Here, he shifts to a fictional filter, writing about a man named Solomon Kugel who moves his family to a quiet New York town, only to find history lying in wait to ambush him.

"I don't want this to sound too crass, but we've sort of made our pitch," said Webster, the son of the late Hall of Fame center Mike Webster of the Pittsburgh Steelers. "We hope the family choses us, but the important thing is somebody's going to get it and it's going to get looked into. Junior Seau was a wonderful man and we're all aware of his work with charities. I wish it never happened. The important thing is, in some way, this will continue his legacy on giving back to the community and helping people."
District officials say they want to offer focus schools magnet schools to students who want to pursue a particular theme in high school or who may not thrive in larger neighborhood schools.

Maybe anyone who voluntarily runs the gantlet we call our presidential election process must be mentally imbalanced in some respect, but this year's crop of Republican candidates has been especially odd.

Back then, she was a high school student, with the implied joke that high school was plenty hellish on its own, no vampires required.

When you’re buying citrus, pick the fruits that have a sweet fragrance and seem heavy for their size, which is the best measure of a juicy, sweet insides instead of dried out flesh. Opt for organic whenever possible - citrus fruits are one of the most heavily sprayed fruit crops - especially if you plan on using the zest, or the brightly colored outer skin. Pesticide residues on conventional oranges can transfer to the flesh when cutting or peeling, and the peel can contain artificial orange color, Citrus Red No. 2 which is a possible carcinogenic and can cause allergic reactions.

Tebow. Tebow. Tebow. That’s pretty much the only story line that Denver will be talking about this offseason. After being named the starter for the Oct. 23 game against the Dolphins, Tim Tebow helped the Broncos to a 7-4 finish and a playoff victory. But when do opposing teams start to figure out that once you limit Denver’s run game, the Broncos has very few playmakers to blow teams away?

The same is true elsewhere. Michigan, where Romney was born, once offered a prime opportunity to flip a state that went for Obama four years ago.

So bin Laden, who loudly scorned American ideals, proposed a very American solution. Call it an extremist makeover.
