Herbs are usually from plants and plants parts for instance basil, parsley, rosemary whereas spices often come from the seeds or the roots of plants. It is beneficial to consume or to add herbs and spices to your food for sometimes it can limit inflammation. For example, cinnamon, a good antioxidanthas been linked to lower inflammation, as well as reductions in blood glucose concentrations in people with diabetes.

There was very little focus on the victim or the perpetrator. This brings me to my argument. I don’t like what the coaches did by hiding a crime and sin of sexual assault and abuse; housing a coach with a child centered non-profit organization to which Penn State was involved for his sadistic activities. The entire Penn State crew who were involved were indeed wrong, morally and criminally.
Dana's baby shower was lots of fun on Sunday. It was a couples shower (which I've never been to) and we had quite a crowd. Dana and John are world travelers - they just returned last weekend from two weeks in Paris and France - and they are decorating the nursery in a travel theme, so we went with that theme for the shower.

When we are authentic, we are essentially trusting the essence of who we are. We are trusting what we are feeling whether that is so called “good” or so called “bad”. It is not about labeling, defining, or judging the experience we are having. It is about us loving ourselves as we are, warts and all.

Sometimes when I’ve spent what I consider to be too much time on a blog post and finally click Publish wondering where my afternoon went, I ask myself some questions: What is the point of my travel blog (especially if I’m afraid people will read it!)? Couldn’t I just keep these travels to myself and make a scrapbook or personal journal that only I look at? Yes. But I prefer blogging. Here’s why:

Well, just a couple of days ago, I waded into the waters by making my top ten predictions for the 1st round of the 2012 draft. I thought I’d (we’d) see how I did.
Like I said, I’m planning to videotape every aspect of the audiobook process and put the videos up on the blogs (this blog, at least), and on YouTube. I think I can make a funny little video (or a couple) of how we set up and do the soundproofing and such things. We really don’t know what the hell we’re doing…but we’re pretty excited about it! It might be amusing to watch us for thirty seconds. And that wouldn’t be bad publicity for the audiobooks…right? We’ll test that (the video-ing) out with the Podcastio production too. Unless it’s really awful and embarrassing, so much that I chuck the whole video plan, I’ll post the videos here.
Oh, and did I mention the selection of wines. Yes, they have a selection of wine. ”A nice German reisling would go great with the seafood salad.” The waitress/stewardess actually said that. And, German reisling is my favorite wine. Wow. “Virgin Atlantic Upperclass”. It’s like you knew I was coming.
The biggest reason I refuse to donate money to charities is infrastructure. Intellectually, I understand why infrastructure for an organization is necessary. But emotionally, I can't justify donating money to a “cause” when a substantial portion of that money is going to go simply to keeping the organization running. I mean, if I were to donate to a non-profit, I would want my money to actually go to whatever they are supposed to be doing, not paying a salary, buying a computer, paying for travel, etc. Honestly, I think I would rather give $20 to some random homeless person rather than $10 to a charity.

This refined American idea of superiority has been around for a long time and partners nicely with the general human arrogance that we naked primates are the center of the universe. While religion lost the war putting Earth at the center of creation long ago, individually that is still how most view their existence.

St. Lawrence's Church at Ludlow is a magnificent parish church. It is a very large church for a small town of below 10,000 inhabitants and as engrossing as some cathedrals. Towns like Ludlow were more more important before the Industrial Revolution than the Victorian cities like Birmingham and Manchester which burgeoned later. Ludlow was the seat of The Council of Wales and the Marches (1473-1689), a regional administrative body like The Council of the North. The Marches were the boundry between England and Wales. The Council was inaugurated to govern the lands held under the Principality of Wales, the lands directly administered by the English crown following the conquest of Wales by Edward 1 in the 13th century. It was in 1472 by Edward IV to counsel and act on behalf of his son, the infant Edward, Prince of Wales. Edward had recently been restored to the throne during the Wars of the Roses, and he and his supporters controlled what were known as the marcher lordships on the marches just within and adjoining Wales. He established his son at Ludlow Castle, and appointed his allies from the Woodvilles and Stanley's as leading figures in the Council. The Council continued after the death of Edward IV and the disappearance of his son under Henry VII. In Henry's reign the Council was responsible for acting on behalf of his sons as Princes of Wales, first Arthur then Henry (later Henry VIII).

Aikido has received a bad rap first and foremost for the lack of individualism and closed mindedness. Yes, there are many different styles and instructors throughout the world, however very few have had the balls to step outside the box and evolve. Unfortunately, the Aikido that has been labeled “Realistic Aikido” has really been a bunch of crap tangled together. Also, the lack of practical and effectively applied techniques coupled with the lack of realistic attacks or may I see sloppy attacks really stand out.

But you see, the drop in salary shouldn’t be an issue. More products and services should reflect more income for organizations – enough to pay reasonable wages for a double shift. And more products mean more sales, and more sales should translate to lower prices. More people employed means more investment and more taxes paid.

The Ink Spots - If I Didn't Care - 19 Million
When I tried to remove the supposedly dry toothpaste, I thought it would be like peeling out PVA glue. It was actually like removing buggers from the model. If I used a blade to clean it, it would have taken me forever and also remove the grey color (even the black primer). So it was really a bad idea. I decided to cut my losses, I took the model under the faucet, and with the old toothbrush went on with the cleaning. Removed all that crappy stuff, and let the model dry.
As I had totally not read the recipe properly, and had just added all the sugar to the egg whites first off, I was forced to start again for the meringue. The mix wasn't wasted though, as I had some yolks going begging, so I made the mix into a chocolate swiss roll. I am not entirely sure how we all found room for this after the pie stuffing, but somehow space was found, and boy was it justly filled, yum!

When the bailout for the institutional banks was announced, We the People did stand up and shout, but TPTB ignored the strident pleas of the population and bailed out the banks anyway. We the People were told that these banks were integral to the financial system itself. These banks, it was explained, were Too Big To Fail, for their failure posed “systemic risk” and could cause a complete failure of the global banking system; they had to be bailed out. This bailout was funded by We the People, though they did not agree to be pillaged in this manner.

The peer-reviewed study by Milly et al. titled “Global Pattern of Trends in Streamflow and Water Availability in a Changing Climate”(Nature, 2005) used the IPCC CMIP3simulations to diagnose the relative change in surface runoff for the period 2040-2060 compared to 1900-1970. A version of their published Fig. 4 is shown below. Runoff is a holistic indicator of surface water balance that integrates the effects of changes in mean precipitation and its characteristics, and also changes in temperature via evapotranspiration. These published results indicate no appreciable change in surface water availability over the semi-arid region from North Dakota to Texas, or for the Midwest as a whole, within this ensemble of CMIP3 simulations. The authors point out the various uncertainties in such regional scale projections, not the least of which one must also include the uncertainty in the consequences of changes in land cover and land use.
-As for age thirty almost drawing to a close, earlier today, after my father yet again asked to put my ad in the “arranged marriage classifeds,” I, for the first time ever, stated that I don’t believe in arranged marriage, and that I’m never going to take this approach. I have never seen both my parents look so disappointed and disgusted in me….ever. Something tells me I won’t be getting a birthday card tomorrow, but that’s okay, because my biggest goal of age thirty was to stop living a lie, and like a true procrastinator, I waited until eight hours before the deadline to do it…but I finally did.
As of right now, this very minute I feel amazing, I am finally pouring out my thoughts that have been hided in my head. I feel so good. I am not creating this blog for others.

This month will begin how I live and find my own way.

I used one of my favorite glues to glue these metal parts together. It is called "Hot Stuff Super T" available usually from hobby shops. It is an extremely strong cyanocrylate glue that does not tend to "bloom" (turn white) on metal pieces. It sets quickly or can be set instantly with an accelerator like "Insta-Set" also from a Train/Hobby Shop. For the finish I used a product called "Sophisticated Finishes" blackened bronze. This can be found online at http://www.tricoat.com/ or at Michael's stores in the faux finish department. It is a wonderful metallic bronze paint.

"Play That Funky Music" became a huge hit when released in 1976, peaking at number one on both the Billboard R&B and pop charts. Both the single and Wild Cherry's self-titled debut album went platinum. Play That Funky Music was #1 on the Billboard charts for 3 weeks. The band was named Best Pop Group of the Year by Billboard, and received an American Music Award for Top R&B Single of the Year, as well as a pair of Grammy nominations for Best New Vocal Group and Best R&B Performance by a Group or Duo that year, adding to their success.

I passed the book along to my 14-year-old, who stayed up all night reading it and begged me to take her to the movie, which was still playing in some local theatres. I figured the movie would be comparable to one of the classic science fiction movies my husband and I have enjoyed, such as “Logan’s Run”. I asked my 13-year-old to read Part I as a requirement to go. I felt that Part I gave enough background for her to understand where the main characters were coming from and the political purposes of the games. Part II and III were largely composed of action which would be played out in the movie; she could catch up on Katniss’ thoughts later if she wished.
So apart from reading Peter Rabbit’s Happy Easter (a really cute story about the fictitious origins of the whole bunny thing) and Don Freeman‘s Happy Easter Corduroy!, and a little bit from our books about the last few days of Jesus, I left it at that. I’m always thinking that I really should be getting them to mass, but the thought of it is just so daunting! Mittens might be able to sit through a mass session, but Abacus sits only for TV, and even then he gets bored much quicker than Mittens. So the thought of bringing them to church (by myself, I should add), to spend all the time running around after Abacus while my energy has been at an all time low, just seems a little pointless.

That hope may be in vain. Already I hear otherwise normal, kind people talking about the need for “population control” in this country but they don’t talk about the methods to be employed in this endeavor. They don’t say it out loud because it means abortion on one end of life and euthanasia on the other. Do they think that these ideas will have no effect on them or on the ones they love? Do they think the many deaths already accomplished have made our nation a better place?

Algaecides are also commonly used in pools. These chemicals are used to kill microscopic plants called algae. Certain algaes produce toxins and need to be removed from pools and drinking water. However algaecides are also very toxic to people. Many algaecides contain chlorine, and the active ingredients are the same chemicals discussed in my first Pool Chemicals and Drinking Water article usually the ones with cyanide. The other chemical that is common in algacides is copper sulfate. Copper sulfate has a limit of 1mg/L in many jurisdictions. Copper sulfate will (very surprisingly) give the water a taste like copper, you know what this taste is if you have ever tasted a penny (preferably a clean one).

6 Rescue
Antinous is a part of the wonderful, beautiful, manifold and pluriform world that we inhabit, and it enriches us to come into contact with that world and the many beings who inhabit it–human, animal, natural, technological, and divine. After engaging with him for a long time in devotion, one may have experiences which indicate that he may have come to have a place in one’s own heart, or soul, or mind, or even one’s guts. I am reminded of some of the earliest inscriptions in identifiable ancient Greek from the island of Thera, in the sanctuary of Apollon where the rituals of the Gymnopaidai (pretty literally, “naked boys”) took place. Many of these inscriptions are homoerotic in content, and speak about the sexual encounters of the different inscribers. One of them, I have translated as “Krimon, best in the dick-dance, has warmed the entrails of Simias.” While “warmed the entrails” carries the meaning of “give pleasure,” it is also quite literal where certain sexual activities are concerned! So, there is no reason that Antinous cannot likewise “warm one’s entrails” when he takes residence in one’s body, soul, and spiritual life after a period of intense and devoted cultus.

No doubt because of his profession, media, journalism, and socialism are linked ideas for Muggeridge, and they become his lens into human sinfulness, especially (in concert with his assessment of the cinema) our willingness to twist reality to our own desires. “People, after all,” he writes, “believe lies, not because they are plausibly presented, but because they want to believe them. So, their credulity is unshakeable” (274). While living as a journalist in Soviet Russia he traveled on a train through the countryside, aware through his sources (and later through personal observation) of the mass starvation occurring outside the cities. However, against these realities, he noted that “These fellow passengers provided my first experience of the progressive elite from all over the world who attached themselves to the Soviet régime, resolved to believe anything they were told by its spokesmen” (212). Those who dared to be critical of the regime—even in Britain—were silenced. Muggeridge writes that “Even Animal Farm, one of the few undoubted works of genius of our time, was rejected by fourteen publishers on the ground that it was too hostile to the Soviet régime, before being accepted. One of the rejectors was T.S. Eliot on behalf of Faber & Faber” (272). The book is replete with examples such as this, many more terrifying in aspect. Despite this, throughout the book Muggeridge doesn’t overstate his ironies; he merely presents them for the absurdities that they are. His ultimate assessment of the era was that a whole host of people,

What better way to look at body image and self-perception than by looking at a story everyone knows pretty well, and one of the oldest stories around that deals with looks, Beauty and the Beast. Alex Flinn has made this story a lot easier to discuss for this subject by having her re-telling, Beastly, set in modern times, with characters we can all recognise, and with the beast telling his story.
In many respects, voice is similar to the soundtrack of a movie. A soundtrack enhances the movie, sets the tone, and above all, fits the story being presented.

The difference is obvious, one Wes had resources and a family that invested deeply in his success. The other Wes Moore didn’t.

Pie has had four doses of his Oroquin-10 paste treatment (levamisole/decoquinate) for his new bout of antigen strain one of EPM. Today was the first day he began to show signs of improvement. His front foot placement has been normal throughout - Dawn showed deficits in her fronts and backs. Today, he began to resist incorrect foot placement with the right hind; the left hind was still abnormal. The biggest change was in his backing - he'd been dragging his hind toes and "searching" with his hind legs for where to put his feet. Today, he backed almost normally in hand - lifting rather than dragging hind feet and putting them down toe first (in diagnonal pairs with the corresponding front), and he could back straight and there was no "searching" with the hind feet. Walking forward, his walk was more deliberate.

Everyone, even those who don’t have aspergers or autistic spectrum disorders, sees the world slightly differently and thinks in different ways about different things. We all have different thoughts and opinions, We all have different values and beliefs. We are all better at some things than others. If we were all the same the world would be a boring place.
The Roman Catholic Church officially rejects IVF and the church has contended that the sort of lawsuit filed by Herx is a challenge to its right “to make religious based decisions consistent with its religious standards on an impartial basis.” In January of 2012 the United States Supreme Court ruled that religious employers can fire religious workers on the basis of ministerial exception and the employer cannot be sued for discrimination. Rather unfortunately, the Supreme Court neglected to define “religious worker” and this has provided religious employers with considerable cover when they fire employees.

Sunday was a day to kick back, take in some afternoon hockey, and taste some fine beer. My friend Steve has been complaining about the amount of beer he has just sitting, not being consumed, and I've had the same problem as of late. What to do? Impromptu tasting, that's what.
Table salt? That's the fine-grained Morton-style salt. It is relatively 'saltier' than kosher / sea salt and way less expensive. It's the choice for the cooking water for vegetables. Sure, you CAN use the other salts, but you'll need to use more and it'll cost you.

The results of the party’s choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the Dungeon Master (DM) according to the rules of the game and the DM’s interpretation of those rules.The DM selects and describes the various non-player characters (NPCs) the party encounters, the settings in which these interactions occur, and the outcomes of those encounters based on the players’ choices and actions. Encounters often take the form of battles with ‘monsters’ – a generic term used in D&D to describe potentially hostile beings such as animals or mythical creatures. The game’s extensive rules – which cover diverse subjects such as social interactions, magic use, combat, and the effect of the environment on PCs – help the DM to make these decisions. The Dungeon Master may choose to deviate from the published rules or make up new ones if he or she feels it is necessary.
We haven’t seen this debate on centre stage of Australian politics for 30 years. But Gillard is trying to reopen it and position herself clearly on one side of the argument. The headline budget cuts hit the wealthy, and all the spends were to the bottom end. It was a clearly redistributive budget aimed at articulating traditional Labor values.

What follows is the extraordinary, but very ordinary, journey. It is a twentieth centruy Pilgrim's Progress, (don't worry, it is not overtly religious), as step by step, the aches and pains of mind and body, the miles clock up. We learn of his childhood, his mother, his marriage and his son, but more about humanity, about people, about how even the most ordinary people live the most extraordinary lives. Slowly his life takes shape before him.

Katniss' journey in Mockingjay is probably a lot more chaotic than in previous ones. The range of emotions she goes through, the thing she has to witness and experience, the choices she has to make, the goals she achieves - it's just phenomenal, especially when you think that she is just 17 and has been forced into this life. She might just be one of my favourite protagonists, I love her!

Gell’s critique is the worst kind of social criticism. It extrapolates personal anecdotes for social impacts. It is the poster child for that Latin phrase, “Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc.” Gell sees something hapenning after Rogers show started to air and concludes that Rogers is nothing more than a naive peddler of child-exploiting commercials and shows. I see what has happened since Rogers show started airing and say, “Thank God for Fred providing an island of thoughtfulness in an ocean of for-profit cartoons.”

Hope had been gone for two years. Even Emily was thinking maybe it was over. Could she give up and go back to her comfortable life, as her friends and husband advised, (dogs get lost all the time, you don't let it ruin your life, for God's sake move on), or would she keep trying to search for Hope? She had her other dogs to train, to compete, and there was a waiting list for puppies. But the dreams were so damn real.

We published a book last year called 'Trains of Thought' - proceeds went to the Wensleydale Railway, which is run by volunteers. The book contained two pieces by each member of our group, all on the subject of travel. I must say that we did rather well with it, running to a reprint and raising a considerable sum for the railway.

Some obstacles are there that are not of my making and there's very little I can do about those. But there are obstacles that are of my own making that I certainly can do something about. If you're in a rut with your article writing as I have been, looking at why you are in that rut, and what you can do to dig yourself out is the first step to getting yourself back on track. Here are my obstacles and what I intend to do about them. I hope it will help you to:

I worked all last week, with Sunday off, then I was supposed to work another 5 days straight. Thursday, I got up and could barely move. I really need two days off to re cooperate with this fibro and back problem. So, I called in and went back to bed, which was all I could physically do.

Please know, although this process has been unimaginably rocky for us with fallen through referrals, God has strengthened us and given us the peace we need to go on living our lives without falling apart. Of course it's painful, confusing, frustrating, and slow, but we have to stay positive and allow God to work his plan.
Holding out at this point also puts allies of the teachers on the Board of Aldermen in a tough spot. After promising to give more money to schools if the unions show movement on concessions, it will be hard to convince those aldermen on the fence to shift money from city services to the one group that has decided to stand its ground in this year’s labor dispute.
I really need to do a post covering the streaking phenomenon of the seventies. If you didn't live through it, it'll be hard for you to imagine how big it was. Why people suddenly felt the need to parade their penises and hairy seventies bush in public places is beyond me. Even worse than doing it, perhaps, was singing about it - I'm talking to you Ray Stevens!

He happened to actually have the entire week off because it was his last week of vacation for the year and he almost always takes it in August. About two weeks before his birthday, we happened to stop by Melissa's house to drop something off....it honestly slips my mind as to why we were there, as Lloyd wasn't home, and it wasn't a "visit", just a drive-by while we were in the neighborhood. Melissa starts going on about MJ's birthday and when did we want them to come over to have a party. We agreed the actual Monday his birthday fell on would be the best day, as we were expecting my sister to come into town a few days after that. Melissa was thrilled, because she loves a free meal, and she also loves to celebrate MJ's birthday like it's her own for some reason. This is similar to Christmas, when the gifts they give to MJ are obviously selected with much care, while they give myself and Tee whatever crap they can find at the thriftstore that still has the original price tag on it.
My friend told me yesterday about Pinterest. I'd never heard of it until then. We were shopping at a shop and the owner there mentioned Pinterest, too. So I went on it and looked around. It seems very interesting. I asked for an invite, but I'm on the waiting list. Hopefully, I'll get the invite soon so I can get on there and start my pin boards.
I guess it all started when the wonderful people of the seattle based radio station KEXP came to us around last year's Iceland Airwaves Festival and asked us if they could shoot a video of us playing a few of our songs. We of course said yes and ended up playing a song called "Little Talks". They then posted it on their website and that's when everything started to happen.

By choosing to reject the truth of the gospel, man refuses to be initiated into the Body of Christ. Therefore, he does not have the Holy Spirit or Jesus Christ and remains blinded to the merits of the cross. It is no small wonder that he takes no interest in the things of the Lord.

It's easy for the old guard to ignore a house like this (the rotting siding and unkempt yard look worse in person than in this picture). It keeps them sane, keeps them rooted in place, keeps them from ruminating on the herculean task of relocating all the possessions and memories accumulated over a lifetime.

Ask a photographer their least favorite time of day to photograph portraits and most will reply, mid day- when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. Sometimes when we as “photographers” are starting out and learning we dont realize the implications of shooting in extremely sunny conditions. If you have to shoot in mid day sun, use flash to fill in shadows, a reflector under the chin to prevent panda eyes and use shade.

Recently, in a classroom nearly 60 miles from that classroom in rural New England another young woman with profound, multiple disabilities was crying every day, during every transfer and every slight shift in positioning. She was unable to indicate in any way what the tears were about. A few days passed and some people questioned if the behavior was manipulation. Danielle and Chuck entered my mind and I asked the nurse if we could try giving her some Tylenol just to rule out pain. The next morning we did just that and to our thrill not a tear was shed all day and for the first time in weeks the student was able to participate in active PT exercises!

One of the recent battles in the so-called "Mommy Wars" is the use of child restraint harnesses that just so happen to resemble a common pet leash. Though not worn around the child's neck, these products come in a myriad of other styles such as backpacks, shoulder-to-shoulder figure-eights, chest straps, and wrist straps. The general idea is to rig one end to your offspring and the other to yourself, thereby preventing your child from being more than three or so feet from you at all times.
The Church only exists to evangelise – that means buildings, churches, parishes, schools and colleges are only valuable insofar as they help the Church in that mission of salvation! How can we as parishes, schools and colleges – as the Diocese – support this sorely needed New Evangelisation?

“So David’s fame spread throughout every land, and the Lord made all the nations fear him” (1 Chron. 14:17). This is the reward of obedience to God. We don’t have to build a name for ourselves.

Emily is passionate about feeding her family REAL food. As in food you would recognize as actual food (vegetables and fruit that are fresh, real hunks of meat, no chemicals you can't pronounce, etc) I have to admit I was a bit nervous about reading the book, because while I really like the idea of real food, and truly believe in the importance of family meals, sometimes (OK, at least a few times a week) my family dinners consist of things like frozen lasagna (I do heat it up in the oven, but you get the idea). I shop at the grocery store, not the farmer's market, and am positive the bananas on my kitchen counter were not grown anywhere near within 100 miles of my home. I was worried that the book would fill me with guilt for all the things I'm NOT doing.
Color and shape. I prefer the abstract, and an immediate impact, rather than a highly detailed, representational image which echoes the real. I rarely make representational art, and if I do, if is often pared to its essence.

This may sound un-American – but I had never been to a baseball game prior to this Sunday. Well. That’s a little bit of a lie. I had gone to high school games (which I’m not sure count) but I had never been to an actual baseball stadium. If you only believe that major-league baseball games count – then I still have not been to a baseball game.
I’ve been corresponding with Kristie about Zauberball. I was confused -- she once knit a "plain" Zauberball, and didn't enjoy it because the yarn is unplyed. Crazy Zauberballs -- like the one she gave me -- are plyed. I looked again at the Cranberry Zauberball I will soon start knitting for my sister, and sure enough, unplyed. We'll see.

So now here I am, 40 or so years later and every time I hear the term Exer... that's as far as my mind can get. It just shuts down... Ain't doin' it. Nope. Nuh-uh!! Yes, I went to the gym faithfully 3-5 times a week for nearly all of the past two years. I walked treadmill hills until my feet blistered, but I was talking to my friend all the while so that wasn't the E word. I pulled handles attached to varying sizes of metal rectangles until my hands blistered, but that wasn't the E word either -- at least not the way I did it! HA! We played racquetball a bunch, but ... ummm hellooooo.. PLAYED - not exer-whatevered.

There were three families in all (Traaseth, Bowman and Allen), eight children and six adults that expanded over two tables. I remember laughing so hard my gut ached. When they brought the $3.50 plate of fries we all just about keeled over. It was a dinner plate (large one at that) mounded high with fries. Enough for, oh, about FIVE people.
Combine broth, 1 tsp salt, carrots, celery, carrot, onion, chicken and rice in a large slow cooker. Cook on low for 6-8 hours or on high for 4 hours. Take out chicken and shred with two forks (if not already shredded) and then add back into slow cooker. In a small bowl combine salt, pepper, and flour. In medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Stir in flour mixture by tablespoon until a roux forms (a thick consistency). Whisk in coconut milk, a little at a time, until fully incorporated and smooth. Stir cream mixture into slow cooker and then let cook on low for 15 more minutes.
Paul “did not think it wise” (NIV) since John Mark has already abandoned them once. The NIV’s translation is adequate, but the word has the sense of being “worthy” or even “suitable to an activity” (BDAG). This could be taken in a positive sense (Paul does not see John Mark as a good “fit” for his vision of the ministry team), or negatively, Paul sees John Mark as unworthy since he has already abandoned the ministry.

I realized that the pursuit of youth and fitness is way overrated and far too dangerous for this “older goat.” When the multitudes receded (and after I was helped up into a chair) I was hoping to hear that someone in that group (you know the young 20 or 30 something hip gals with the latest iPods) had at least videotaped me. I was brutally aware of how embarrassing this would be for the kids (even though they were not present) and the only way to survive this and maintain my “coolness credibility” would be if someone had videotaped the evil treadmill throwing me across the room then I would be on YouTube and be “cool” anyway.

The initial mishandling of the case by the Sanford Police Department is a poison pill. I don't see any way to recover from that in a criminal trial. Secondly, there is no way that George Zimmerman, with the facts being what they are today, will be convicted for 2nd degree murder. I recognized that from the start, and I was surprised by the higher charges. The jury will likely have an option to go for manslaughter, but a conviction even on manslaughter is a 50/50 toss-up, due to the tainting of the case and the media circus. I hope the Martin's can get some resolution and some peace...but I think justice may have to come by way of civil court. Criminal charges are being brought now as a way to diffuse tensions (people remember L.A. in the early 90's... I recall it like it was yesterday). I think prosecutors and the State of Florida in general would like to pass this off to the court system... hoping that the courts can fix the mess of a lunatic with an arrest record being issued a CCW license, and a police department botching an investigation. They at least would like to be able to say they sent the case to a jury. But in the end I just don't see a conviction.

Professor Hoffman said fatigue with the war on terror, and the fact al-Qa’ida has managed no significant Western terror strike since 2005, has led many to assume it is a spent force. “Bin laden is dead and gone and I think that exactly captures the mood of the electorate who want the war on terrorism to be over. But there’s no evidence that al-Qa’ida does not believe a significant terrorist strike could reverse its fortunes.”

Ponder on that for a while.
Why does a resolution to be more Therese-like and offer up little annoyances for some general heavenly purpose get transformed into:

There's nothing particularly frightening or original here in this story, but the concept of a cursed bloodline is admittedly one I have a bit of an obsession with. The males of my family seem to carry a bit of a genetic curse themselves, having addictive tendencies, manic-depressive episodes and an increased likelihood of burning out early, if not outright snuffing their own flames. For this reason, I've opted to go the way of the count, and am bringing the Metro surname to a close.
I could just feel the parental eyes on me as I gathered my daughter's belongings and willed myself to remain calm. I passed a friend who asked what was wrong and I told her. Hell, this was breaking news for our itty bitty school so I may as well face the music up front. I pulled both kids out of school and headed to CVS for the dreaded box of Rid at the nurse's suggestion. My son calmly read the instructions on the drive home while tears poured down my daughters face. While the chemical laden treatment shampoo did its thing, I raced around bagging pillows, comforters, stuffed animals, etc. to toss in the garage. I then ripped the beds apart and threw everything I could into the washing machine. Load after load I washed away any hidden signs of the creepy little buggers but I still had to tackle the hair. Ugh. I called a friend, cried a little, and settled in for the job ahead. After two hours I'd only gotten through halfway through her head, the kids hadn't eaten dinner, and I was beside myself. Did I mention my husband was away on a business trip? Happy Valentine's Day to me!
Bam: New School in some cases is a bit old School to us in a good way as there are a lot of Electronic elements from a production point of view. This was like back in the day with Soul Sonic Force, Nucleus, Man Parrish, Egyptian Lover etc. The sounds are old but the raps and position is new. It’s crazy when people go ‘Oh my god they are rapping over a rock or indie rift’ when this has been done before. I think sometime some New Schoolers need to dig in themselves and bring out something incredibly new! Also where is the DJ????
I would have finished these in class, but was stymied by the silly little straps. The last bit only took a few more minutes after class.

In response to the general tone of these many criticisms — even if they had been well founded — I must say that it appears somewhat disingenuous to describe these assignments as “reflection” assignments. Reflection has a generally positive connotation. To reflect means to be thoughtful — as if to imply that you and I would be reasoning together, toward a constructive outcome. It seems unfair to invite students to share their thoughts with you, and then to attack them for what they have said. What you appear to expect, in these papers, is not a reflection, but rather a defense, claim, or argument.

I would love to be able to attend an Amish estate sale but somehow I never find out about them until after the fact. Do you have any advice on how to get a notice of any estate sales?
With that as background, what follows are some Ian Wallace quotes from Vengeance Is Mine that seem to be offending some thin-skinned liberals:
The subsequent exhibition of the paintings at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York sustained a net loss, although when profits from catalogue and postcard sales are taken into account, Guggenheim estimates that it earned a profit of approximately $2,000 from “Niagara.” fn.2 In 2004, the auction house Sotheby's reportedly appraised “Niagara” at $1 million. The work has not, however, been sold, nor does the record indicate that it or any other painting commissioned by Deutsche Bank has been offered for sale or been the subject of a bid.

In hindsight: I loved everything but the best part about the day was having David all to myself all day and being able to just talk about everything we never get the chance for! The girls were nodding off in the back of the Kombi and popped their heads up every now and then and got out when we stopped somewhere so it was a partial rest day for them ;)
So forget the 50/50 affordable housing plan announced in May. This is 31% "affordable housing" and, in actuality, only 12.3% of the units would be affordable to people earning less than Brooklyn's median income.
After an incredibly busy day yesterday, which involved spending WAY too much time in the car driving all over the metro for a variety of reasons, we made today a quiet day. We did little besides cook, eat, and lounge, although we did get out for a walk this afternoon. Here's today in food:

Without having seen the film or read the book I think it is possible that this would be quite well representative of BPD as the character does seem to have a lot of the traits of BPD, how well this is demonstrated and whether it is presented fairly remain to be seen – but I will be adding this to my to be read/watched list, as I would like to find out!
I'll keep you posted on the progress, but I don't feel like revealing much more about it. I want to keep it close to my chest and protect it. Not because it's so precious that no one can know, but because my relationship to this idea of wanting to be a writer is fragile at best. I worry about it perishing and being left with nothing but frustration and my inner critic mocking me with a cruel, "I told you so."

My prep for a game in minimal in most cases because I allow the players to drive the story. But there will be situations going on that occur beyond the players control that often steers their actions. Example, a war with a neighboring kingdom and the eastern iron ore mines were taken over by a small army of the rival kingdom. All of a sudden weapon and armor prices triple and those lowly bandits along the road are now organized military ambushes. Do the players have to do anything about what's going on, absolutely not, but they can if they choose to.

When he had awoken and escaped from the hospital he had taken these pages and examined the broken phrases upon them. He put them together with absolute care, knowing that a divine hand guided his work. Sometimes when he was gripped with doubt he wished that he could remember the teachings in their pure form and he wailed against fate and circumstance and he would suffer a fitful sleep beset with nightmares of fire and overdue Harry Potter books.
A 2009 state law led California public schools to award those degrees to both living and deceased students as part of the California Nisei College Diploma Project. The action came after the University of Washington and University of Oregon also granted honorary degrees in 2008.
Wei gave the question careful consideration. Once again, intelligence had been sketchy. Wei had photographs, taken by a remotely controlled drone, that showed activity around a series of huts in the general direction that he and his troops had been traveling, but hard evidence had been lacking. Hard evidence had been lacking for this entire American campaign, Wei lamented.
I made this cake a while back and don't know why I haven't posted it until now. It's very good. Bundt cakes are one of my favorites. They are fairly easy to make and go a long way. I always have to cut myself a really big slice too.....Just so good! I found this over at Gulf Coast Gram. Haven't made many new dishes in a while and I need to start trying some. It's getting movtivated that is lacking here lately. I find myself getting very lazy in the winter and love cooking in the summer. Crazy....nothing like heating up the kitchen on an already hot, humid day!!! But I don't care for winter and can't wait for spring already. In the meantime, I just have to find my motivation again!
Am I the only one who thinks this? I’ve read two of his novels over the past year, Juliet, Naked and How to Be Good. Both left me with this uncomfortable ache about what relationships can be. Is everyone doomed to be in an apathetic marriage/long term relationship? Is there no passion? Does sex always become just another thing to do? Oh God. Now I’m freaking out. Thanks, Nick Hornby.
Although their achievements are many, I am not writing this to feature bullet points on a curriculum vitae. Hellen and Harvey are remarkable as human beings. There are many things that come to mind regarding the couple, but for anyone who has been married or in a committed relationship, one of the most incredible thing that stands out in the marriage between Hellen and Harvey is that they don't fight. Harvey told me that one of the first things Hellen asked him when they met was about his approach to conflict resolution. Anyone who has had relationship and/or marriage experience can easily understand why Harvey was so impressed with this first question.

The Prophecy is a novel I hadn't heard much about until I picked it up last week. As someone who adores all things futuristic the premise defintely appealed to me, but I hadn't seen many reviews and so I wasn't sure what to expect. As it turns out, I was pleasantly surprised by this absorbing and unusual story set in the Earth's far distant future.
The worked precious stones are one of the glories of the country. On the other hand is dificult to return from Brazil without having bought at least a new suit for the beach, a pareo, and any disk of bossa nova.
The inclusion seminar that you went to was good information, but that doenst mean it was exactly what is best for Kendall. There are extremes in every situation. If you look at inclusion as a spectrum and not an "all or nothing" or a "pass/fail" situation, then you can see that Kendall DOES fit into the inclusion game.
Anyhow, I definitely want to pencil in more time in Moscow during my hopeful next visit to Russia because it is definitely a stellar city and I know we did not even touch the perimeters of its offerings. One final story, we boarded the train for Kiev around midnight and landed in Kupe (second class accommodations) with an older couple – probably in their 50′s. The poor couple looked at us like, “oh no, we got stuck with English-speaking foreigners!” So, I tried to speak with them in Russian a little bit and got drilled with question after question about where we were from and what life was like in the U.S. Needless to say, we made two new friends and I didn’t get to sleep until about 2:30 a.m. Note to the anti-social: train travel in Russia is not for you (unless you buy yourself a ticket in first class isolation). Additionally, for those of you who are curious, the train from Moscow to Kiev does not pass through Belarus (no transit visa needed). However, the train from Kiev to Petersburg does, so plan accordingly if you find yourselves traveling these routes!

He endured the season and though no one told him when the reporting day was for the next season, Brown showed up. Aside from finding a friend or two, Brown was treated the same in season two that he had been in season one. During practice in season two, Brown sustained serious hand and knee injuries for which he was offered no attention from the trainers or medical staff. He had to limp off the field by himself and drag himself to the student infirmary to receive care. That was that for Brown’s football playing days at the University of Arkansas. But it was his injuries, not his guts or a lack of determination, that kept him from returning to the field. Brown’s attempt to be a one-man integration movement for southern college football was over.

For some time now, old-fashioned re-productive, repressed, unmoisturized heterosexuality has been given the pink slip by consumer capitalism. The stoic, self-denying, modest straight male didn’t shop enough (his role was to earn money for his wife to spend), and so he had to be replaced by a new kind of man, one less certain of his identity and much more interested in his image – that’s to say, one who was much more interested in being looked at (because that’s the only way you can be certain you actually exist). A man, in other words, who is an advertiser’s walking wet dream.”

We went up into the Flinders Ranges and saw lots of small towns and some giant CHICKENS running around with sheep!!!!
But mostly, Belloc reflects, "The New Year is over-valued. Properly speaking, it is not there at all. It is a whimsy; it is an imaginary; it is a fiction of the mind; it is a convention; it is a fraud." In fact, Belloc cannot figure out why those who "object to anything that is not tangible and can be tested by experience" have not protested against the arbitrary imagination that says that the New Year begins on January 1, when it could in fact begin at any time we choose.
It probably makes more sense.

The key reason behind interest in this device is it includes different features as well as among all the most crucial the first is its ability to personalize. iPhone applications provide a enjoyable browsing encounter and apart from this particular the device may also be used as a useful press player, with regard to sending as well as receiving tone of voice messages as well as phone calls, digital camera, with regard to being able to access web and other social media sites. Various programs for example video gaming, company, resources, sociable, travel reserving, encoding along with other effective applications could be created. For game enthusiasts there’s a great news because iPhone supplies a lot of video games including 3d game applications. Its features can be easily customized and this is exactly what arises the need for iPhone app improvement.

I know very little about my great-uncle and have written previously about my regret at not questioning my grandmother further when I had the opportunity. In 1984 I was living in Germany where my husband was stationed with the RAF, and that Easter my mother joined us for a visit of the WW1 battlefields, and an attempt to locate the last resting place of her three uncles. I was living at home with two small children and had the time to do some research into military records. I didn’t have the luxury of the internet then and everything was achieved through a laborious series of letters to regimental headquarters, museums and so on. People were very helpful and we were able to locate the grave of one brother and the inscription of the other two, who had no known graves; one on the Menin Gate in Ypres, and one on the Thiepval Memorial, allowing us to pay our respects and remind ourselves of the great sacrifice paid by so many.

There is another way to eat, I know, somewhere between industrialized, corn-fed fake food and fungus-ridden-today-we're-eating-dirt-grown-your-own-grass food. There are farmer's markets. Local agriculture. All that jazz. But that doesn't take into account how people are going to eat during the winter, or those precious spring months when you're growing what you'll gorge on come end of summer. You end up eating a lot of turnips and jam and drinking a lot of vodka.

There is nothing to do, nowhere to go, and no one to be or become. That’s what it was like before the universe was born.

First, we want to get ourselves some good canned tomatoes. My preference here is imported San Marzanos from Italy, but certainly if you’re orthodox and are staying strictly Kosher adherent I believe there are some decent canned tomatoes from Israel now. Just be sure it doesn’t have any added sugar or artificial junk in it (and certainly, not High Fructose Corn Syrup, lest not because of the fact that it is Kitniyot, but that stuff is absolutely awful). In fact I would stay away from anything that wasn’t just crushed tomatoes, period. You’ll need a 12-14oz can.

Father, I thank you for the conscience, and that you have caused me to attach my conscience to the highest thing possible. That doesn’t mean my conscience is perfect. It is, after all, still part of the fallen flesh. But you have been drawing me closer and closer to you, by the power of your Spirit. By this, my conscience will always tell me what is the right thing to do. But, again, the question is, will I obey you? Aye, there’s the rub. By your Spirit, and by the power of the ascended Christ, I pray for the strength to obey you in all things, Lord.
I fell in love with each of the characters, and I can’t wait for the next book and the next mystery. The story pulled me along and I could not stop turning the pages. (I even brought it to work with me to read on break.) Aside from telling a spectacular story, this book made me think of some areas of my own writing that could use some refining.
Lots of agents are busy these days and I’m pleased to say I am among them. Lots of offers fewer acceptances, but things are moving along at a pretty good rate considering that it’s July. 27 Ford Lane in Old Greenwich is reported under contract today. It’s new construction with waterviews and access to a dock that, at high tide, will get you somewhere. A very nice house on a good street but its first price of $4.550 million was stretching things a bit. Its lower price of $3.7 million was an improvement and enough to find a buyer.

It’s easy to think you can get ahead by putting other people down or that intimidation and manipulation are handy tools for staying in control. But the thud of ruined relationships and reputations is a big price to pay for doing whatever is necessary to keep yourself on top. Lying to weasel out of a problem erodes the trust factor and compromises the strength of your character. The list of thud-able choices is long and the consequences are often irreversible.
While many know my grandmother to be an accomplished cook, what few know is that she can out-garden the best of them. I have personally witnessed her green fingers do everything from revive a wizened bonsai to coax stem cuttings into propagating prolifically. It is truly something else, and woefully something I have no knack for.

On opposite corners of the Rue de la Victoire two unlikely neighbours stand facing each other.

Which brings me to the Social Media Time Suck. As an author, I know how important self-promotion is, but it takes up so much time. It also is a fine line between “look at me, look at me” and simply being present. I have to admit I am shy when it comes to social media. I’m much more of a stalker than a tweeter or a poster on Facebook. I try to post but I can’t seem to find anything witty enough to say. I need a good hash tag. Any suggestions on one I can start? I see a lot of authors doing clever lines about their books. I love that. I don’t like it when they just repeat verbatim excerpts from their books over and over again. Blatant self-promotion is not my thing.
What follows is a much more detailed dicussion on how the energy output of Io has been determined, concluding that the average over a 10 year study was 10^14 Watts, as above, which he will use as the standard that “theoretical models of the tidal dissipation need to be tested against ”.

Last year they put out their second album. To me the second album had a lot of work to do to even be on a par with the first and unfortunately I don't think they managed to pull it off. I think the second album is great and has some wonderful songs on it but I still go back to the first album more often.

Talk to you all soon,
All this skee balling and bowling and dancing worked up quite an appetite so I took advantage of the lovely bowling lane snack bar to acquire some dinner for our group. Isabel, in true fashion, ate about 2 bites and stopped. There was way too much going on for a picky eater to take any time out for food. Ryan, on the other hand, was apparently near death from starvation. He ate….two pieces of pizza and two mozzerella sticks. Yeah….did I mention he weighs about 22 lbs? So he pretty much ate his body weight. Then he wanted Mom, and I was so touched….momentarily. Then I gleaned the true object of his desire. See, I was just starting to eat my dinner, a tasty cheeseburger, since I’d been assisting Grams in getting the kids fed. So I scooped Ryan into my arms, he pointed to my cheeseburger…..and signed for “more.” Sigh. So being a good Mommy, and knowing I have some pounds to lose, I gave my sweet, starving boy some more chow. I guess it was just a matter of time before we had a kid with my appetite.
Remember Miss Andrews? she could not get through the first volume (Northanger Abbey, I:6), so wholly unlike was it to Udolpho. Isabella Thorpe herself “thought it had not been readable” (I:6), though we must not forget Mrs Morland year in and year out reading and re-reading but then new books do not often fall in her way. Nevertheless, I don’t dismiss it: I believe Henry was telling the truth when he said Grandison was one of Jane’s favorite books and her niece might have idolized her when she was 8-10.

So there you have it, regardless of what you call them angels, guardian angels, guardian spirits, ministering angels, ministering spirits, archetypes, ancestral spirits, whatever, they are all meant to assist us. Therefore, working with spiritual beings is biblical. By working with them we not only can ask spirits to help us personally. We can also direct them to assist us in other endeavors such as protecting our homes, securing employment, preventing accidents, protecting us from danger, protecting our children from all forms of bullying, preventing crime and the list goes on. Since Kamitic spirituality is about being led by the Spirit, working with spirits is one of the Kamitic ways for improving our life.
We have collected a variety of resource and information materials on root cellaring. We have also completed construction on a root cellar of our own, located in the basement of the Ecology Action Centre. We are happy to provide advice and information for organizations and individuals building root cellars, regardless of whether your application is successful. If you are considering building a root cellar in your community, but are not yet in a position to construct a root cellar, please send us an email and tell us more about your project. We are looking to gauge interest in this type of project.
Yep, we are at the Malaga Airport which means our wonderful vacation has come to a close. We have enjoyed it so much, but we are ready to go home. We are less than ready for the 26+ hours that it will take us to get there, however. The worst part of it will be the last leg, Detroit to Phoenix. Between a bad tire on the plane, a backup on the runway due to a storm, what should have been a 3.5 hour flight, took us 5.5. And because of the storm, our take-off was like a roller-coaster ride! Seriously, I had that little "paper bag" in my lap because I thought I was going to need it! I didn't, thank goodness! I felt like kissing the ground when we finally landed in Phoenix!
The office manager was all business regarding my request and, to my relief, she didn’t demand an explanation. She did press for a January meeting, and I agreed, but didn’t settle on a year. When they do call back to remind me of that perceived commitment, I’ll deny all knowledge of gutters, eaves, fascia and soffits, and will adamantly insist that roofing in general is all a big hoax.

Perhaps I’ve been lazy the last couple of days as I’ve been posting poems and paintings, perhaps with no connection. OK the last two were erotic to a certain extent; the last three featured animals; connections can be made.

They are colourful characters, these worms. Aside from the black feet and legs, their bodies are patterned with dayglo reds, greens and blues – in varying amounts, so that each is quite individual. They are also somewhat spikey. You will find some that are predominantly red, others softly blues and greens – but all are entirely focussed on their job which is to eat every green leaf in the mopane forest.

Wel actually it’s only a day older but that one day will make a whole year… So sweety, when you read this, tomorrow, after enough sleep (and all the people crossing their fingers all night will have some cramped fingers whole day long, sorry about that people!!), I wish you all the best! Happy birthday sweety. Enjoy your day of work and remember what I told you. You still look as hot as you looked in 2006. O wait… I did not tell you that. well…. now I did. Love you sweeety.

Directly East of me, just about 150 yards away, my neighbor had started a bonfire. I could hear his distant response to my other neighbor’s questions about what he was doing over there: ”just burning the trash pile.” Regardless of his mundane reason, his lighting of that sacred fire on this day at this time was quite remarkable and could not have been planned any better than one of those staged rituals so popular in the “alternative” community. He did it, for whatever reason/intuition might have influenced him, spontaneously and without fanfare or contrived self-importance. That is the place and spirit in which true magic can be found, always hiding her presence in simple activities. Somewhere in him, he knew to strike the match to honor this evening, above all other evenings.
In 1953, the International was a worn out, tired New York stage, having gone through a host of different owners and renovations since it first opened -- as the Majestic Theatre -- in 1903. At different periods of time, it was owned by Florenz Ziegfeld and William Randolph Hearst, and its stage played hosts to virtually every form of entertainment, from burlesque to ballet.

He had been informed by his chamber servant upon waking that it was a Tuesday. This did not sit well with Fuckington. Tuesday was an entirely disagreeable day. Rising slowly to an upright position he reached under his bed and retrieved his riding crop with a yawn before striking the servant across the face with a sudden flurry of movement most unbecoming to David’s state of being. The chamber servant recoiled from the blow, upturning a chamber pot as he stumbled backwards and spilling its slurry all about him.
Sarah from Sweet Times in 2nd--I was so interested in what Sarah was saying about student led conferences. Although she teaches second grade, this type of conference is mandatory in intermediate grades in her district. I asked her to write a blog post on that, so I could get some more information on it! :-) She also has a giveaway going right now for a cute Mardi Gras unit.

Large scale black and white nudes and ambiguous scenes share the wall next to pop culture pieces of detailed stylings as women strike a pose for Newton in his delivery of the female as a force of nature. The powerhouse collection, including some photos never previously exhibited, further affirm Newton’s clutch in fashion photography which continues to be revisited throughout gloss today. The German born Helmut Newton remains a fashion sensation artistically and culturally, as a pillar for magnetic glamour visuals from its birth in the mid 20th-Century through today. In every major publication from from Elle, Vogue, Playboy (the overwhelming list goes on), the work of Helmut Newton stand alone, and stands tall as a major force in the fashion industry from the onset of his career until his death in 2004. The collection is on display through June 17, at the Grand Palais in Paris.

Do you not ever have those days when you wish you could take a tablet that would stop your hair growing or changing in any way? I do. You just want to capture the perfect moment forever. But it fades. It fades and it dies. It dies. God, it's awful. I feel like crying right now. It goes like this. See, when it is going great guns, you want to look in the mirror all the time and touch it a lot, but you don't want anyone to see you touching it a lot and looking in the mirror while you touch, because you are supposed to be a writer and librarian and sort of scruffy and intellectual. Really, I would sell my brains to have beautiful hair. I would. Seriously. I would rather be stupid than bald. Mainly I feel a bit bad about being bothered about my hair. It is made out of the same thing as fingernails or antlers. So my scalp is covered in long dead antlerly fingernails. But I want the fingernails to be shiny and big and full of body, causing admirement, but not staring. I want to have antlers that made other people jealous. That has never happened. Do you have any hair tips for me?
I just submitted book two to the publisher. It involves several of the same characters as Espionage, but I’ve tried to write it as a stand-alone novel. Now I’m working on book three—about half-way through the first draft, but I don’t write chronologically, so more of the end is done than the beginning and middle.

First I tried and kind of failed at making cake pops. A friend of mine got me on to these a couple weeks back, and I have been obsessed with them ever since! I have watched clips on how to make these sweet sweet morsels, and figured they were pretty easy. Either I was too impatient, used too much icing or my stick was too thin (I’m thinking all of the above), because they certainly were not easy, and although they taste delicious, they look majorly wrong and kind of gross.

Like most other gardeners I'm so anxiously awaiting spring. I do the daily walk through of the yard seeing what changes are happening. I keep trying to find things to do outside, but there's only so much that I can do yet. Too early to put my seedlings out or to plant many seeds. I've had a small pile of things accumulating that I have been "saving" as something to do on a day that I have time to garden. Today I was able to do a few things.

The script written by Bill Lancaster is wonderfully constructed. Sadly, Mr. Lancaster passed away in 1997 due to a cardiac arrest, and was not able to contribute his thoughts to Universal’s amazing Collector’s Edition DVD. The Thing was the last piece of cinema Lancaster was directly involved with, and at least he could say that he bowed out of filmmaking on a seriously high note. This happens to be a pure classic in the genre of science fiction & horror. The dialogue is always great, never ever cheesy or cliché. There are bits of humor, but nothing that works against the tone of the film or the scene. Any director would be privileged to work with a script this well-conceived.

Port Elizabeth could soon be known as Nelson Mandela! That's right folks - the Black masses of the Eastern Cape are starting to re-write our White history and are going to rename all the cities and towns in the region with their unpronounceable gibberish names. If they had designed, built and founded this area then maybe this wouldn't be so hard to swallow - but they did nothing but be parasites on the white tax money, sucking the teat dry and now they get to run this area into the ground and, to add insult to injury, rename the whole area to boot. No money to keep their people out of poverty and to stop the crime, but they can find the millions that it will cost to rename a whole region!

The next day Lamar and Luther excitedly mounted their trusty two-wheeled steads and sped over to Uncle Virgil's place to ride around out front while awaiting the impending arrival of the April Fools' delivery ... upon their arrival, there sat Uncle Virgil on the front porch in his rocking chair, also apparently watching for the mailman ... a few tense minutes passed and here came the mailman ... and there went the mailman ... didn't even stop, didn't even slow down as he went by, just an odd smile and a wave as he passed ... the boys were at a loss, what had happened to their parcel, had the mailman delivered it earlier prior to their arrival? ... had it been lost? ... they looked over at Uncle Virgil just as he flagged them down and asked if the mailman had been by yet ... "why yes" Lamar replied, "but he didn't stop, just waved and smiled, and drove on by" ... Virgil said, "well fellers, if you don't mind, since you're already right there next to my mailbox, open 'er up and see if there's anything inside, just to be sure, it'll save an old man a long walk out there and back" ... with seemingly nothing peculiar about the request Lamar graciously complied, figuring that if the dead opossum had been delivered earlier, unbeknownst to them all, he would simply carry it to Uncle Virgil as if none the wiser, then hastily retreat back to the road to observe the happenings with his cohort Luther DooLittle.

- But jobs are just arbitrary tasks whose purpose is to divide humanity’s combined wealth, it’s a very inefficient system that doesn’t accommodate everyone’s interests. If you’re lucky to be born with the inclination towards something people have decided they’ll pay money for, life is good. If your inclination happens to be towards something currently not in fashion, life isn’t so good. My inclination seems to be unmarketable at this point, so unfortunately I must decline your request.

The moral of the story? Next time you're really in it for the beauty and you get that tap on the shoulder from the giant electric hand of god, try not announcing how spiritual you are to your horrified other, just 'be' in that space and come to terms with the value of your own direct experience. Keep it a secret that you can express only in anonymous good deeds.

However, the day we moved in (Wednesday) was the day the stove top arrived. The workers were here converting the stove to propane gas while we were moving in. After the workers left the "boss" builder stopped by to inspect their work and the damn stove exploded. Like blue flame, the knobs flew off, and the boss about lost it (after he raced to turn off the gas from the wall). I was instructed not to use it until they could get someone out the next day to fix it. Next day came (Thursday), more workers in and I got the all clear that a gas leak in the line had been fixed and we were good to go. We ordered pizza that night because I was too tired from unpacking to cook. Friday was the inspectors day to stop by and check everything out. And what to you know... the farking stove exploded again. Bigger this time. With blue flame and smoke and the whole nine yards. More panic from the inexperienced homeowners.

Despite my intention to ignore him I couldn't resist a disparaging look at his meager equipment - I hope lip curling scorn needs no common language to express - and I'm pretty sure he understood the Anglo-Saxon vernacular I employed to tell him exactly where I thought he should go.
So the choices are killing him there, or bringing him to trial and ultimately executing him. There’s no question that killing him then and there would be less costly, and swifter. And is the media circus that would go with a trial just an added cost that we probably didn’t need or deserve? How many times have the news outlets already aired footage from the destruction of the World Trade Center? How many more times would we see it in a trial?

So… I never wanted my dad to get old. Even as I became a man, I was but a child in his presence. He was larger than life. My father stood all of 5 foot five (I’m only five foot six) and yet he loomed over me like a giant. A superhero. It’s hard to adequately describe the feeling; to this day, I can’t quite put a finger on it. Was it due to immaturity on my behalf, or some mystical aura my dad possessed? Do all fathers make their children feel that way? Will I do so for my own daughter? Like the elusiveness of Santa Claus, I suppose that’s part of the magic…

Thierry Wasser is now Guerlain's in house perfumer, succeeding Jean-Paul Guerlain. He made many perfumes I enjoyed, yet I never loved any of them. Lancôme's Hypnôse, Guerlain Idylle, Guerlain Flora Nymphea to name a few. He even made one that I dislike, Armani's Diamonds (fruity boring gourmand). So I wasn't expecting much, but he did surprise me with Shalimar Ode à la vanille, a Shalimar flanker, and I regretted not buying it. I'm glad I bought PI.

Ultimately, a film trying to capture mistakes done, one after the other because of the passion or to become a star or out of sheer anguish or confusion or covering the previous mistakes committed, this doesn’t really succeed, but as far as a standalone film is concerned, saying that it isn’t entertaining or absurd is killing quite an interesting and brave film.
Now, I may have mentioned that all of the characters are likeable and rather strange. However, I was mistaken – there was one character that I dislike. His name is Eric, and I wish that he would drown in the floods of iced tea that he presumably drinks, because he is southern, and this is what the internet tells me they do. (I mean no offence to you southern people. I’m sure you’re all lovely, even if the only liquid available there other than swamp water is iced tea.) Anyhow, what astounds me about Eric is the fact that he refuses to develop, refuses to stop smiling and acting all bashful, and also refuses to throw himself of a bridge. Strangely enough, I do rather like Max, however cynical and antagonistic he proves himself to be. AT LEAT HE DOESN’T BATHE IN ICED-TEA.

I was born in Texas and raised on the delicious cuisine called Tex-Mex. I live for a basket of salted tortilla chips and a homemade salsa with a surprise of spice. I crave cheese-laden enchiladas. I need refried beans twice a month. Did you know the first margarita machine was made in Dallas and now resides in none other than the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History? Miami isn’t quite as flush with Mexcian food as Los Angeles and Dallas, so I usually make what I’m craving instead.
The Texas State Fair was always the biggest state fair in the United States. (Everything has always been bigger in Texas.) We always had the most fun on the Midway, or, if not it was because we ran out of money, money for food, for games, for rides and for shows, and we’d sneak in where we could, so that we could have more money for more food, more games, more rides and more shows. We’d of course spend most of our money on serious eats such as Frito pie and corn dogs or the latest widgets and whirligigs. It took all day to see it all, the statues, the barns, the science exhibits, and the famed Cotton Bowl, and…and…and… Or, if we wanted a little excitement we could take in Joie Chitman’s Thrill Show or the Sky Review; or for music go see “The King and I,” which had just come to the music hall in 1954. Sometime around then they brought Big Tex up to date. They made him talk. Then before you knew it they put him on WRR, broadcastin’ live from the State Fair of Texas. You could also catch the Blues. “This is WRR broadcastin’ live from Fair Park and we’re proud to present Mr. Ray Charles.” Whereupon the best we could do was acknowledge how big Mr. Ray Charles really was.

Second, they need access in terms of the time and space for messing around that can ultimately lead to “leveling up” and geeking out. Check out this space, YouMedia, and watch both videos for a great explanation as to how, and why, these spaces are important. Clearly, what you see in these videos is an ideal and is unlikely to be replicated at this time when schools have inadequate funding for the “necessities” — but then, who determines what is and is not a necessity? According to the ISTE report, one challenge we face is that “technology is not valued as an instructional tool” (p. 2). Furthermore, they suggest as strategy #2 to “help make progress toward digital equity” that we must “continue to challenge perceptions about the role of technology in education” (p. 11).

Let me just say, I am not a big fan of Usher’s music. It has just never been my thing. Still, I included this track because I actually really like it. I actually really like a lot of Usher’s most recent music, which has been much more dance-oriented, like the David Guetta track “Without You” and his single “DJ Got Us Fallin’ In Love.” This song falls right into that same style and is actually really catchy, although I don’t think this song is anywhere near the caliber of either of those songs. Like I said, though, I am just not really into Usher’s music and don’t really like his voice. So, if you do enjoy his music sometimes and don’t have an predisposed opposition to his vocals you will probably really love this song, so check it out!

The Killers marked the screen debut of Burt Lancaster and his tough vulnerability is shown to good effect in the movie. There’s enough innocence in the Swede for you to genuinely sympathise with him and despair at the big lug’s stupidity as Kitty plays him for the ultimate sucker. Ava Gardner’s Kitty gets the classic femme fatale intro; we first see her as the Swede does – seductively clad in black satin and vamping for all she’s worth in a night club. Her character is rotten all the way through - effortlessly hooking the smitten Swede, playing the gang off against each other, and finally, tearfully begging a dying man to save her neck by damning himself. The role of Edmond O’Brien is to offer perspective and lead the viewer through the labyrinth of deceit; he’s really the linking device between all the small episodes that make up the whole. O’Brien’s own guide along the way is police lieutenant Lubinsky (Sam Levene from the Thin Man movies) and there is good support from gang members Albert Dekker, Jack Lambert and Jeff Corey. However, two of the most memorable turns come from William Conrad and Charles McGraw as Max and Al, the killers of the title. Their roles don’t extend much beyond the first ten minutes of the film, but those are ten truly magical minutes. They get some of the choicest dialogue (and deliver it perfectly) as they simultaneously mock and menace the occupants of the Brentwood lunch counter.

Gov. Jerry Brown has quietly ordered the State Department of Corrections on Thursday to begin considering new protocols, including a lethal injection with just one drug, which would allow the resumption of capital punishment.
Instead when you pray don’t ask for tricks. Don’t use the phrase “in Jesus’ name” like it’s a magic word designed to goad God into action. Do this and you’ve crossed number 3 of God’s big 10 rules and used his name lightly. Instead ask God what he wants to do, and what he wants of you. Then you can say “in Jesus’ name”, knowing that its his will you’re after and not your own.
The Ministry for the Environment announced today that they are contemplating approaching the international community to lift the ban on trade in rhino horn so that South Africa can sell it legally, in an attempt to disrupt or destroy the poaching business. Reports indicate that South Africa may be sitting on a stockpile of around 20 tons of the stuff, which is estimated to be worth around R 500 000 a kilogram. That’s several times the value of gold.

Our visit to the ChocoMuseo was great for another reason. In our workshop group were six other people – five Australians and one Brazilian. We had a great time with these folks and after the workshop, they invited us out to dinner with them at this crazy-good restaurant near our hotel called Fallen Angel. Since traveling is just about the best way to meet new and interesting people, we were happy to go.
Some other colleges situated in South Dakota emphasize mainly one or a mere technical violation and is one of South Carolina's defensive statistics against other opponents, they had to watch the south carolina county history in 8 plays.

Back to the point, in a comparison between originals and knockoffs, there is always a price difference. The Cambridge Satchel goes for 105 euros, while the H&M version goes for just 15. But the H&M will definitely end up being more expensive once you add the price of the plane ticket. Which one do you like?

While all this has been going on, my hubby was laid off starting June 1st! The refinery where he worked was slated to be shut down but it has been bought by a new company that has already started to refurbish and get it ready to reopen some time early next spring. Hubby is supposed to start back by October or November (it may be even sooner) so in the meantime, we are getting things done around the house and taking a few short trips. The refinery where he works is the only one on the east coast of the US that can process sour crude (crude oil from the Middle East) and I was sure it would never actually be shut down, but it was scary until it was announced in April that it had been sold! Yeah!! A lot of thanks goes to our great governor here in Delaware and his staff who worked tirelessly to get the deal done. They also were able to get a deal with Fisker Automotive to start producing electric cars in the old GM plant here in Delaware. All in all over 3000 people will be brought back to work thanks to their quick thinking and determination to get the state 'back to work'. Thank you, Governor Markell!!!!
So then I started to think about a science lesson from the 5th grade. Our teacher grossed us all out by informing us that the same water has been on Earth forever. Therefore we routinely drink dinosaur pee. To a 10-year-old this is a VERY memorable statement!
The art continues at Roots. I know of only two beers in Oregon that are brewed without hops (blasphemy?), and both are brewed by Craig. The first is an old fave, Burghead Heather Ale, in which heather tips offset the sweet malt--a standard in the days before brewers discovered hops. Upon first inspection--sniff, swallow, smack--it seems different enough from a regular beer that many stop at the one sip. Weirdly, though, the more you drink, the more it starts tasting like a regular beer. With Nicholls' brews, that's usually the way; he uses herbs to accentuate beery tastes, not to mask them. You could travel the country and never find a beer like it.
Her hair is getting so long and I keep trying to grow out her bangs, little by little. Her eyes are still brilliant blue and she has cheeks! I think she still looks very much like her daddy but there are pictures and days where I can see a little 'me' in her! She will say 'hand' and she wants to hold your hand. She says a word that sounds like 'nine' and we don't know what she is saying - some of our guesses "mine", 'naughty" or she is really smart and knows german and is saying "NO" Nora is starting to get afraid of strangers and gets bashful and shy around people she hasn't seen for a while. She is VERY clingy to mommy and daddy.

What work, then, is race doing in the Padrones from Quito’s jails for the century 1750-1850? There is a silence here despite the prevalence of terms we associate with racial categories in the modern period, even well into LatAm’s modernity. From the perspective of the state, one’s presence in jail intersected with certain fiscal and administrative categories, but not as racial categories and not in the manner that race comes to indict individuals. These categories, even in the 1850s, are still corporate, and relate to legal rights and restrictions accorded to corporate membership. Interestingly, though, the administrative categories could reinforce stereotypes of indigeneity, such as its equation with rurality. There are other tantalizing clues as well, in that on occasion individual’s status will switch after weeks in jail. Evidence for litigation records would suggest that those individuals were declared Indian at the time they opted for representation by the Protector for the Indians.

The plot exists to spin character relationships into conflicting threesomes. Characters are continuously caught between two options that have only one real outcome: Forster’s Max has Jackie’s plight and Ordell’s retribution, but you know he’s going to side with Jackie. DeNiro’s Louis has Ordell and Melanie, but you know he’s going to side with Melanie. Jackie has Nicolette and Ordell, but you know she’s going to side with Nicolette. Melanie tries to create a conflicted threesome with Louis and Ordell, but you know she’s going to self-destruct. All of this makes the film less about choice as it does consequence, but it’s not even the actual consequence that’s the focus as much as it is the focus on potential consequence.

The expectation is that there will now be progress on resolving Siachen and Sir Creek especially after the recent tragedy in Siachen has highlighted the futility of such confrontations. The reality however is that Pakistan cannot accept and condone Indian aggression in Siachen by agreeing to ratify the actual ground positions of the two forces—something the Indians insist on. Nor can they agree to the Indian view on Sir Creek because that has implications for the extension of the boundary line into the sea. No one knows the exact contours of the agreement the previous regime had agreed on in Kashmir. So there is a long way to go but a beginning has been made and hopes are high because this time trade and economic considerations are powerful drivers.

Corruption, grandstanding and total incompetence may sink Brazil’s dreams of becoming an oil exporting powerhouse. Prosecutors in the country last week slapped Chevron and drilling partner Transocean with an $11 billion fine for accidentally releasing around 3,000 barrels of oil off of Brazil’s coast. While the fine is clearly excessive and unlikely to stick, it has raised questions regarding the long-term safety of doing business in Brazil.

I discovered a single packet of Cipollini onion seed in Lidl yesterday, labelled Roja de Niort. If you are not too fussed about having a particular variety of vegetable seed Lidl has a terrific selection at only .29 pence a packet. Of course as this late in the season they are picked over, but I managed to score a packet each of butterhead lettuce, pickling cucumbers and the Cipollini with a late season discount of 2 packets for .50p. I had such success germinating the first packet I decided to buy onion insurance. This is just in case the standard sets don’t do well planted this late in the season. There are approximately 200 seeds per packet and based on the first packet over 85% germination. The first packet I seeded in lines inside a tray of compost, meaning I will have to prick each one out in order to plant them all. Boring. This time I am going to seed each seed in a small paper pot so that when they mature I can place the pot directly in the ground avoiding the hassle. It’s a bit fiddly but nothing as painstaking as pricking out.
I intended on giving a blow by blow account, in order to possibly help out someone who may find this post down the road if they are in a similar situation. But, I just really am feeling empty and tired. I took some photos, which I'll share, but I can't bring myself to write all the details out. Let me try to sum it up in a sentence .... Since Monday morning, there have been fans and dehumidifiers in the bathroom, Tucker's room and basement, attempting to dry out the now exposed plywood in the bedroom, hallway and garage below. Dang it, I need another sentence. One more.... Most or all of the first floor carpeting will have to be replaced, as well as a good deal of insulation that was ruined in the garage basement ceiling (directly under the leaky toilet). Insurance company has been great, as has my contractor. For the most part.

I had the pleasure to meet Jonathan Frid at conventions a few times, and he was an affable and charming person, with a great sense of humor. At one con a fan asked where the famous Wolf's Head cane he used on the show came from. He answered "Sam the Umbrella Man on 57th St" very matter of factly, which made us all laugh. And it was true. The store was still there in the 1980s, and they sold umbrellas and canes of all types, including the "famous" cane. Frid continued to do recitations and even had a website where he wrote about Dark Shadows, acting, his stage career and his current interests. Frid was always on the fringes of celebrity and never quite understood what all the fuss was about. He was a man thrust into the spotlight for a few short years, but he was very much a regular guy.

Thus in Manu Brahmâ (the Logos also) is shown dividing his body into two parts, male and female, and creating in the latter, who is Vâch, Viraj, who is himself, or Brahmâ again—it is in this way a learned Vedantin Occultist speaks of that “goddess,” explaining the reason why Eswara (or Brahmâ) is called Verbum or Logos; why in fact it is called Sabda Brahmam:—

I grew up on a farm with wide open spaces and lots of sunshine. I go back a couple of times a year to visit family (they live a long way from me) and usually find some time to go walking. On one of my walks I came across a gum tree. That in itself isn't unusual as there are many gum trees in the area, however this particular tree was special. It was magnificent not just because of it's thick solid trunk, beautiful coloured bark and green leaves, it's magnificence was in what it represented to me. At the base of the tree lying on the ground were three very large pieces of dead trunk that had obviously been part of the tree at one time. The tree had suffered some kind of trauma yet despite the odds had survived and grown a new trunk, branches and leaves. It seemed to be saying well I might be down but I'm not out. I'm not finished and I've got some more growing to do. It somehow seemed symbolic of my life.
and I haven't really thought about following any colour combo
However, one of the other great things about a fireplace is that it creates an instant focal point in a room. There is no guessing on what should be the centerpiece of the room. Fireplaces make it easier to decorate even for non-professional-just-trying-to-make-my-home-as-pretty-as-I-can-using-as-little-money-as-possible-people. Like me. Just try to arrange the furniture and decor so that the focus is on the fireplace and mantel and instantly the room looks more put together and balanced. Plus it provides a ready surface for displaying collections, flowers, and seasonal decor. Here are some examples of drool worthy living spaces with a fireplace as the crown jewel of the room.

In my father's inbox were three emails, forwarded by my uncle, who has just gotten bit by the genealogy bug and has started doing some research.

This may be the only surviving photo of him.

By this point, it’s 3:40am, and I needed to have this post out yesterday, because I didn’t post anything all of this week, and I need to look like I’m somewhat active so that Anime Nano doesn’t pull me from their database.

When we left I actually interviewed for a worship leader position in another church. I really wanted that job. I felt God challenging me to truly become a worship leader. I wasn’t sure how He wanted to accomplish that since I hate speaking to a crowd, but that feeling was undeniable.

Well, the papers have been signed, the details worked out and all the t's crossed and i's dotted. It has been over a year since we separated and we finally have a separation agreement. Now all there is left to do is wait for the final divorce to be granted and work out how we move on and try to parent our kids.

The ride was ten minutes around the property and A loved it. Our driver talked about how his family had a horse farm and how hard it was for them to work it for any profit these days and, therefore, to keep it. He had a beard and wore the Amish clothes but it took me a while to sort out if he was Amish (he was) in part because I thought it might be rude to come right out and ask it and in part because I'd never spoken to an Amish person directly so I didn't know if they should have a unique accent and he didn't.
It proved a bonanza: Johns's "Flag" sold to New York art adviser Michael Altman for $28.6 million, above its $15 million high estimate. The Crichton works may also have spurred other collectors to offer up their pieces by Johns, including "Figure O," which sold for $4.1 million.
As a senior government official explains: “The budgetary allocation and the compromise reached in January are face-saving measures. Since the prime minister had made UIDAI his pet project the government had to give in.” The bureaucrat is referring to the decision by the government to allow UIDAI to collect the biometrics of another 400 million residents—it was earlier allotted 200 million—after a public standoff between Nilekani, who enjoys Cabinet rank, and Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram on the biometric collection issue.

As the late Professor Tinsley of Yale explains, in oscillating models "even though the mathematics say that the universe oscillates, there is no known physics to reverse the collapse and bounce back to a new expansion. The physics seems to say that those models start from the Big Bang, expand, collapse, then end." In order for the oscillating model to be correct, it would seem that the known laws of physics would have to be revised. This may be correct, but it's misleading. The known laws of physics have to be revised regardless, because we need a theory of quantum gravity to make any predictions. There is no known physics to reverse a collapse, but the same could be said of any early universe scenario. There is no known physics to explain inflation, even though we think inflation exists. All that's known is that classical physics predicts a beginning (I believe this is also in dispute), and that classical physics doesn't apply.

This one felt like a love letter to the fans: secret sex! the glee club died! Gravity! every wacky fan fiction prompt too ridiculous to make an episode about! If the show is, above all else, about the group’s relationship I think it’s necessary to have an episode before the big finale where they take stock of the status of that relationship and think about if being in the group another year is worth it. I want these characters to hang out because every little crazy adventure we watch makes them better.

Today was a very academic day, methinks. I woke up early and finally got back to reading and completing Insecure at Last: A Political Memoir by Eve Ensler. Ensler, being a playwright and political activist, is most famous for penning The Vagina Monologues, leading the V-Day movement and advocating to stop all forms of violence against women and poverty. It was very touching to read the stories that Eve has gathered from individuals who have experienced so much in their lives; who have lost so much, and yet who continue to rise above it, who continue to have hope, who continue to live. It is amazing what some people have to go through in their lives and it is amazing what some people manage to achieve. I think this is why it is so important to be vigilant and active, to not surrender, to continue to be informed and to do the things you can to help those in need. Because they need it. And they appreciate it. They don’t want to be victims, but sometimes, we all need help. And they’ve been through a lot more than most. There is something in knowing that there are people out there, on the other side of the world, who still care; who don’t turn off the TVs, who don’t say they will do something and don’t. Every action helps.

Our work for God is done in the mundane toil of life, it is when we are building whatever it is we build, or preparing a meal or going to work for eight hours that God is glorified. Or tending the sheep. Even when we sleep God is working.
This is a perfect illustration of a disobedient human race even though good intentions reign. Remember Proverbs 14:12. “There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.” The modern man is ultra-confident knowing that he can solve global warming, aids, poverty, and all social malfunctions. From Psalm 2:4, “He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision.”

So what if instead of focusing on the memorization of names, dates, locations, events, and even some concepts, teachers focused on the most effective ways to gather the most accurate information, and then, how to synthesize and apply this information to reach a conclusion? Of course it is important to know stuff, but what stuff is the most important to know? My father use to argue for the use of calculators. His point was that once the basic math was understood, that a calculator could speed up the math process allowing people access to high-order mathematical equations and algebraic concepts.
Among the many places to see in Rapid City, my definitely favorite would be the Skyline Drive.

What makes a person "honest" in this hobby? I think honesty comes into play when you start interacting with fellow hobbyists (be it collectors, buyers, dealers, or the fellow next to you at the show). How you present yourself, what you say, how you act and how (if it gets to this point) you deal/trade with others have a direct impact on how you are perceived in terms of "honest/dishonest".
I love this type of artistic process the best...the struggle to suppress reason and judgement and engage the....?...universal energy, soul, raw emotion?

At first, Edson gave in readily to political favoritism, paying back some of his Democratic cohorts -- including many of the Tammany variety -- with lucrative city jobs, a decision which disgruntled many of his former supporters. In fact, he even appointed Richard Croker as fire commissioner; Croker would become the head of Tammany Hall in the 1890s. (Harper's Weekly has a coy little cartoon chiding the Croker decision.)

It’s like living your life with part of it missing, and nothing can fill that empty space. It’s knowing he’s out there, somewhere, possibly living very close by. And knowing that his real heart loves & values his family, but the silence is because he “had to make a choice” between them and us…
Jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so. I don’t remember not knowing the name of Jesus. My mother saw to it. She taught me that the Bible is God’s word and that it is important to read it every day. I saw her do it. I still do it.

But my favorite beer of the tasting, easily, was the awkwardly named Double Mocha Latte Imperial Stout, made with cocoa powder and cacao nibs, and Kona and Colombian beans ground right into the mash. Sounds gloppy-gross, right? I was apprehensive, but this tasted like Joe had somehow crashed his brewery into a great espresso bar and filtered the wreckage into a serving tank: very adult drink, not overly rich, dry cocoa character, and solid coffee background. At 10% you'd want to watch yourself, but you'd also want at least two. This was one of the best coffee beers I've ever had, and one of the best chocolate/cocoa beers I've ever had. The coffee and chocolate were unrestrained, but sweetness that usually comes with them was not a factor. I like my coffee with a bit of cream (and plenty of crema) and no sugar; this hit me right between the eyes. Nice, nice job. And it's undoubtedly gone by now, but...he's gotta be making other good stuff.
My 16-year-old daughter has been very busy studying for her AP exams, so her "fun" reading is on hold. She's eager to read Return to Exile, though, especially because she and I got to meet the author back in March at Writing for Charity.
THIS is what's wrong with me, that the very reason for my living, this LOVE, this unabashed and glorious reason for breathing was taken from me so violently, that I truly have not taken a breathe since (you know, the kind that nurtures you, the kind that makes you glow with the knowledge that everything is going to be ok).
The second pickled vegetables I made for this month - making my own pickles was such a bonus of doing Iran this month, as it's something I've never even thought about doing. These pickled carrots were also a big hit with one of my guests commenting it was like eating a "carbonated carrot" because of the tingly sensation in her mouth! Check out the recipe here.
When the gratin - European royals and aristocrats, American and South American millionaires, Hollywood movie stars, politicians, artists and general hangers-on - moved on after the ball in the not-so-early hours of the morning, they left behind not a legacy of taste and style for the aspirational, as is occasionally supposed, but something of far more lasting value. That something, which for a few short hours, was merely a theatre for one of the silliest of human activities - striking attitudes, playing at tableaux, and seeing and being seen - that something was the glorious set of rooms at the Palazzo Labia.
Speaking of American Presidents I have seen the trailer for the Summer release of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and it looks interesting. I like stories which take a mixture of historical figures and literary characters and blend them into something new and if this film is successful maybe they’ll have try at other novels like Anno Dracula or The Difference Engine.
"He's not a big fan of Bob Dylan or Joan Baez, but he does listen to The Dubliners because I've heard him when I'm not in the room. He likes the stories - we both do - if there's a good tune and a good story, that's all you can ask.

My favorite scene was when the Freyda came to Sookie’s house. That was so Sookie, what makes her unlike any other character. Her responses, so unlike what my reactions would have been, are always surprising and I find myself rooting for her, sure she’ll come out on top, with just the right mix of sass and class.
HOLLY: Power is a big theme in DBAW—Asher has power over Joy, and she thinks to survive on the streets she must develop a power of her own. She sees that kind of authority (she calls it “street powers”) in the homeless friends she finds—Creed’s power is through his music. Santos can talk his way out of anything. May has the power of disguise. But at some point all of those powers fail, and what is left is survival skills. One thing I learned through my research was that there are three typical outcomes for homeless kids: they go home, they get off the streets, or they die. One better choice can make the difference between a hopeful outcome and a grim one. Joy’s choice is internal—she discovers her words have power. She finds the courage to speak, and that makes all the difference for the survival of her friends. I hope readers will realize they have that kind of internal resource as well.

One of the few nice things about living in The Slum here is that, dazed with sleep, I could still throw on some clothes, walk to the corner, and buy croissants and other pastries for breakfast. Very good croissants. Made by the people who also made very good bread, which I bought whenever soup or salad was going to be the main dish for dinner, or when I felt like a sandwich and would buy a loaf, halve it, and freeze the other half. Ortholan is a local chain, with a big store down south on the Avenue de Toulouse which fabricates and half-bakes the stuff, and two other stores, one of which is on my corner, and the other of which is across the Comédie, which finish the baking and perfume the air here between 2 and 3 in the afternoon. And here's what it's looked like for a week:
But the 43-year-old Ader, who manages $200 million in his hedge fund, says it's a different story for many of the wealthy who work in finance in New York City and don't spend a lot of time in states with high unemployment and high foreclosure rates. Living in Manhattan or the Hamptons or hedge fund havens like Greenwich, Connecticut, can lead to a bit of myopia, he says.
He said: “The half year results in 2009 versus 2010 show a fall of £13m but underlying that are three things. Current year underwriting performance has improved significantly and we have released a lot less from prior years.

Since I have 3 little boys and a slew of nephews, I am very partial to boy-themed products…and these stamps definitely hit the mark for me ! I love the cute images included with this set (the frog is only 1 of the ELEVEN (!!!) image stamps (and there are also FOUR sentiment stamps included)…love the versatility and variety. And just because they would work well for boys definitely doesn’t mean I won’t be using them on some girl themed projects as well…how cute would this frog be stamped on PINK chevron paper?!?
If the King has any authority and power over his Kingdom then it’s his responsibility to get to the bottom of exactly what is going on in his Country, and he would do so on behalf of the people murdered on July 22nd 2011 which included specifically a bunch of innocent misguided Norwegian kids snatched from this life by a man dressed in a police uniform claiming it was a coup de tat.
More seriously, it raises questions about whether we live under a government of laws. Congress can pass statutes that apply to some businesses and not others, but once a law has passed — and therefore is binding — how can the executive branch relieve some Americans of their obligation to obey it?
Her own classics are here, too. Bad Reputation, I Love Rock N Roll, Cherry Bomb, Little Liar, Do You Want To Touch Me? (Oh Yeah), and the Springsteen penned Light Of Day, all rock hard and fast with zero subtlety. There's never any problem understanding what Joan means.
At The Good Earth we are always stumbling across wonderful opportunities! We have loyal “earthlings” Dennis and Leslie who happen to be a hobby apiarists. In the winter we chatted about possibly bringing two hives over from their place to ”vacation” at The Good Earth. What a great idea! I am very fond of bees and the thought of Good Earth honey was very appealing. With the earlier than expected arrival of spring, we went into overdrive and just this past Friday my puppies and I welcomed Dennis, Leslie and two beautiful bee hives (complete with Good Earth “pink” doorsteps) to the garden!

Something is bugging me but it might be just my imagination or over-thinking… knowing the old me, it could very possibly be just all in my head. In case it is not, here is what I have to say about the occurrence. If you don’t want to talk to me, that’s fine, you can just tell me. I will respect that and won’t ever bug you anymore. I don’t think being treated this way is what I deserve but that’s just a part of life. I will live with it and I apologize for whatever I might have done to lead our friendship to this point. Would love to know what happened but I guess I will never know and I am ok with that. I think I got your point now…

There really is no place like home, but I have to say I left a little piece of my heart back in Arizona. I was blessed with an amazing stay at Chateau d’ Hunyady. A fabulous place filled with love and family. Each of my four hosts made my stay so warm and welcome, thank you sweet family!
Chop the cabbages into small pieces and toss together in a bowl. Finely chop the chives or green onions and add. Add the orange slices, cutting larger wedges into bite-sized pieces. Add the dressing and toss to coat the salad evenly. Place the salad on a plate and sprinkle with toasted peanuts or cashews before serving. Enjoy!

I mistakenly dealt with a person once from the assumption that he was a Christian who just needed help in his sanctification to over come his abusive ways. And I dealt with him for — I am ashamed to say it – years. Yep, it took Jeff that long to get a clue. But I finally did. The reason nothing changed is because there was no repentance. And where there is no repentance, there is no Christian.
This seriously only took me about 1hr from start to finish so I think I will be making tons more of these. Just got to see how well they hold up to washing dishes in my house where every single pot gets used for every single meal haha. Hopefully they last well but if not I might just make a new one each week :P
Comcast tossed my wife and I away this week. At first I was angry, though now I find myself moving to a place of hurtful acceptance. To be fair, this had to be at least partly my fault. I’d let myself go over the years and, as customers go, I’d become pudgy and so very predictable.
My entry way table is continually changing. I feel like I am never quite satisfied with the look. Right now, I am somewhat content with it. I figured this would be a good time to show it to you all before it changes again.

I never would have thought my roommates would catch on to all three aspects of my PSP, but I was wrong. My last part was riding my bike to class as much as possible and I have inspired my roommates to take part again! They aren’t going to go out and buy bikes but they will be getting roller blades! They are excited to put them to use this summer and have fun while working out and helping reduce our CO2 emmisions. I’m excited as well to have them participate. I never thought my PSP would be this sucessful and, you better believe that we will keep doing this after thex class is over.
Sadly, it was at the O2, great idea for a venue but sadly lacking in atmosphere, you wander from a nice indoor street to a concrete waiting pen. By the time we got in, we did feel that instead of being wristbanded they could have cut the middle out and just tagged us though the ear. Also the music venue is sponsered by Stella 4% so no concert beer for me, not a problem but the Cidre which was also being served was unbelieveably chemically smelling that you knew if the person next to you had been drinking it. ﻿
I was going to post some Easter pictures finally but I lost my memory card for my camera! Major bummer! I'm hoping it will turn up. I probably put it somewhere and I just can't remember.

The funny thing is, the kid is so doggone beautiful. She is smart, she's happy, she's self-confident...I just love to watch her. Life is fun for her, exciting 'round every corner. She's idealistic, stubborn, and the person everyone turns to when they need something. She's in New York with hardly any money, and doesn't seem to be worried about that at all. She's never lead a group there, but doesn't seem too concerned. She'll have the time of her life, I am quite sure.
The days leading up to that were hard for Amy and me. It’s never easy when your finances are dwindling and you’re wondering what path you’re supposed to take and responsibilities are hovering over your head like a gargoyle on an old, monolithic building. That rollercoaster of emotions never stops in times like those, and the down times can be treacherous. You begin to question a lot of things, including your faith. You start thinking and doing things that you shouldn’t.

On September 21st, World Alzheimer’s Day, educational programs are being held in dozens of countries to raise awareness about the growing challenge of this disease for individuals, families, and society. This year, the Alzheimer’s Association-Greater Illinois Chapter, is pleased to bring together professional and family caregivers for a morning of learning about recent advances in science and care.
In celebration of our 13 months together (and as an apology for completely forgetting the 1 year anniversary) I decided to give my blog a mini makeover. In other words, I spent some quality time on a Paint Document redesigning my blog’s header. I wanted the header to feel whimsical and fun, just as I intend my blog to be. After all, it’s just a simple blog about a little girl chasing big dreams. Once I had painted on some vibrant-colored sunshine and balloons, I touched up the color on the blog title and tagline, fixed the quote at the bottom (one of my favorites!) and called it a night.
Lenny was confined in his house and we placed the crate with the door open at his doorway. Then i climbed in with a herding board and a bucket. We didn't have much room and Lenny is a big boy , but i moved quietly and slowly blocking him , creating a shoot to the crate. I suggested that he could go in all by his self , that he was gong on an adventure. The he need not worry as he would be safe, but needed to be very brave. Lenny moved towards me and i allowed that using the board and with the bucket ready in my other hand he put himself in a perfect position. Gently placing the bucket over Lenny's head he moved back wards to get away from it and backed right into the crate.

When you visit you can see the ruts in the road from the carts, you can walk in the bath houses and imagine that this is where at the same time you were bathing you were visiting with your friends, you can also see the brothels where there are little mosaics over the rooms to let you know what you can expect, you can meet your friends in the local wine bar and you can visit the beautiful homes of the wealthy. The houses and the stories of their occupants are fascinating! It is really an unbelievably preserved place.

The problems that continue to afflict the Board were highlighted before the Hon’ble First Bench of the High Court of Madras in a PIL filed by a professor in Intellectual Property Rights, West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences, Kolkata (W.P.No.1256 of 2011). The Hon’ble High Court has, by way of interim order, directed the Central Government to make available good infrastructure to the Board to ensure proper functioning. The Central Government has indicated its willingness to allow IPAB to hire a bigger accommodation till a regular infrastructure is available. The Board is in the process of finalizing a suitable accommodation. The PIL is still pending.

The Arizona law requires law enforcement officers to check the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally and check with federal officials to verify. They would also write new state penalties for illegal immigrants who try to apply for jobs.
So how's the beer? Fine. It's professionally-made, reasonably drinkable, and actually pleasant. It's got just 3.9% alcohol but a noticeable 18 IBUs. There's a smattering of wheat, providing interest. It's lively on the tongue and easy to swallow. I'd certainly choose it over anything the macros are peddling. But it's not a high point of the brewers art, nor was it intended to be. It's a commercial product, period.
I'm feeling really good about myself, with losing these 10 pounds and I am still highly motivated to keep going. My mother has gotten on board now too. She's having success and we're enjoying doing this together.

I don't know what it was, but something about the combination of holding that newly home Chinese baby in my arms and news of faster LOA's really perked up my spirits. In that still, small voice he uses God spoke to remind my heart that Cora is on her way home to me. I can't put my Lord in a box, but yesterday was just enough to remind me that while adoption trends change, HE stays constant.

Seymour Hersh, my idol, worked at my future dream job as a journalist for the New York Times. He risked his life a bazillion times for a story, and I was determined to uncover as many stories as he did and more. This story, right here, is what I need to start my career.
This summer I was placed in a unique position. I traveled the country (and a few others) with people I had met only weeks before. While I could go on forever in all the ways that this experience pushed me and caused me to grow, there was one thing in particular that this group provided: new eyes to watch my spiritual life. My brothers and sisters were ready to challenge me because they saw me for who I could be in Christ. They knew the freedom that I could walk in. They were not afraid to be brutally honest in calling me out in my sin, painful as it was.

The voluntary ban won't prevent the businesses from distributing the supplies left in warehouses, but Manis said that his clients anticipated the action and have not ordered the product in weeks. . . .Also signing on to the agreement was the board of the Maryland Beer Wholesalers Association, which represents about 1,600 of the state's roughly 6,000 licensed alcohol stores and bars. The group's board of directors Wednesday voted to ask members to yank the product from their shelves, though individual liquor stores and bars may determine if and when they want to comply. . . . The agreement won't preclude lawmakers from pursuing a complete ban in Maryland. The possibility of legislation was floated by Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown, who presided over the Board of Public Works Wednesday at which Franchot announced the deal.

We had high hopes of him and we just hoped he could deliver. He was also a big fella, around 120 kg, and he had a big voice, to match his size, that could travel to the general manager’s office when he used it. So, if you got into trouble with him, you also got into trouble with the bosses as they didn’t want all this extra noise and carrying-on.

We should definitely set up some kind of proper memorial for your family, though. I have to admit I’m not really up to speed on tauren traditions, so you might want to talk to someone a little more in the know to make arrangements. I would offer to help with that myself, but I feel like it might not be such a hot idea for me to go up to Baine Bloodhoof and ask him about tauren burial customs. Things might get a little weird.

They chose an especially dark spot in the corner – they seemed to gravitate towards darkness. I brought them water, and when they looked at me, their eyes shone like candles. That disconcerted me, and when the slender youth asked me a question, I couldn’t meet his gaze. His companion’s eyes had the equally unnerving quality of seeming to rest on me and on something else at the same time. That was when it occurred to me, with a kind of guarded premonition, that Death had entered the Riad in the guise of that beautiful youth and maiden.

Of course everyone has heard of James Cameron’s recent decent to the deepest point of the ocean. This is the second such descent, though the previous one was with two people, whereas he descended on a solo dive. National Geographic did a great article on his descent.
So sad and pathetic my calendar had become that I no longer reviewed my previous year, I just quietly tucked it away into my filing system never to be seen again by the light of day. That was until this past year when I sat quietly down and flipped the pages over and over and over again. I sighed long and hard as the flipped pages revealed a year devoid of anything interesting with one exception. I could only account for one meager highlight. One moment to remember when I knew I must have had more moments than that, that I should have had more moments than that, when I should have celebrated more, remembered more, smiled more, giggled more and shrugged more. But I didn’t. I had only one moment in that entire calendar year that I thought was worthy enough to jot down in ink.
On Wednesday, April 27, 2011, the Alabama community in which I live was devastated by an F4 tornado. Many neighbors were killed, and many more homes and property destroyed. We were very fortunate, for God's hand of protection was on our home. We had damage, but no one in my family was injured.

A kinship was formed and at times, came when most needed. It astounds me the amount of support and general camaraderie that comes from the writing community. I don't know how many times I've tweeted at certain points of my writing process where I was stuck, frustrated, and needing that little push to finish whatever goal I had set for myself at that particular time. The frawesomesauce virtual friends have yet to fail me in picking me back up and giving me that push, that encouragement, that little shake of the virtual pompoms that have made all the difference in the decision to keep doing what I love: writing.

And I really love using facial expressions to establish emotions that would sound clunky if written out--no need for words like “happily” or “angrily” or “sleepily”. I can illustrate a big smile, frown or yawn. And it makes my inner writer happy to know that those emotions will be shown--especially since I have to cut so much text to get my word count as sparse as it needs to be for a modern picture book (around 500 words these days).
In regards to ceremony decorations, there is not much that I can do to compete with the natural beauty of Fort Popham and the Atlantic Ocean as a backdrop. So I decided to keep things simple. I have a personalized aisle runner to mark the aisle and to protect my dress from the ground, my mother is going to help me decorate a wedding arch for the ceremony to take place under, and I made flower cones to hang at the end of each row of seats for an added bit of decoration to my aisle. I opted to make flower cones because they are different from standard pew bows, and I think they add a nice touch. They are also extremely easy to make and cost effective. For eight flower cones, I purchased eight sheets of cardstock at 25 cents a sheet, and four spools of ribbon, on clearance, for 97 cents each for a grand total of just under six dollars. My inspiration for making flower cones is from this site, although I ended up making my own subtle changes.

Like most children, I was fascinated by the animal world and particularly large animals that could not easily be seen, except in zoos or wildlife parks. My youngest daughter is following in my footsteps. Not content with all her small cute cuddly toys, last year she asked Father Christmas for ‘life size cuddly animals’. I tried to persuade her that there might not be much room for these giant beasts to roam freely in our house, but she was not for turning and on Christmas morning Father Christmas dutifully delivered a giraffe (‘Jo’) and an elephant (‘Ellie’) with which she now happily jostles for space in her tiny bedroom. While squeezing around Ellie into her room one evening I asked her what it is about these enormous animals that she loves so much – ‘It’s because they’re bigger than me and you and everyone, but they’re still our friends!’ she answered simply and went on playing.
A long time ago, marketers figured out that hypersegmenting the tot world and magnifying the differences between boys and girls would make a very good strategy to sell boy stuff and girl stuff. Which is why we have boy toys and girl toys (some of which are just pink versions of Lego). Now, while your daughter can get away playing with Thomas the train (most of the times), you might be warned that your son will be scarred for life if you get him a kitchen set. Not a tutu, just a kitchen set. Some feel that all this segmentation discourages cross-sex friendships in our little ones. And Orenstein worries that “if early experiences with mixed-sex play have a lifelong positive impact on kids’ behavior, aptitudes, and relationships, the segmentation of every possible childhood item by sex was more troubling than I had initially imagined”.
Jane Austen mastered the novel.
She and I had breakfast (bowls of cereal) and then talked about what we were going to do that day. Her mom had attended Eckerd College as an undergrad, and she wanted to go see the school. We had also talked about going to eat at Ted Peters' Famous Smoked Fish earlier in the week. After talking for less than five minutes, it was decided that she and I would go visit both the college, and then ask the rest of our spring break roommates if they wanted to join us for lunch at Ted Peters'. Once the other two girl roommates woke up, they told us they also wanted to join us at the college. Neither of the guys were too interested in the college, so the four of us set out to go look at Eckerd College.

Further down the car, we can see the rear brake duct cascade. Rules allow 12cm of bodywork inboard of the rear wheels, there is no stipulation that these function as brake cooling ducts, so teams exploit this for ever larger stacks of aerofoil sections to gain downforce directly acting upon the wheels.

KABUL, AFGHANISTAN – A suicide car bomber and Taliban militants disguised in burqas attacked a compound housing hundreds of foreigners in the Afghan capital on Wednesday, killing seven people, officials and witnesses said.
I learned much more about Vespucci than I had known. We are told in school, "he was a mapmaker and so America got named after him." But that's a real distortion, because he was actually the first European "discoverer" of South America. Verazzano was the first European to set foot in Manhattan. There's a stone from the family castle enclosed in a wall of the Verrazzano Bridge.
He drinks so much of the stuff that I've had to start watering it down to a 75/25 water to juice ratio.

I stared at the open window in slowly dawning horror. I thought about it for five seconds and shut the window down and turned off the computer. “Okay, that’s enough for today. No more computer time. By the way kids, we never ever EVER set up accounts on-line unless Mom or I am here and watching you do it. So DON’T DO IT.”
BUT! Firstly I have to read and absolutely ginormous number of titles before I go on holiday mid-June (yes I know that's in three and a half weeks - eek! But I have been reading for weeks; it took rather a long time for the judges to be announced). Worse, for me is that my hands are tied when it comes to blogging about individual YA titles if they are on the list submitted by publishers.

Le Guin’s exploration of a genderless society while writing in the late 1960s is an excellent piece of feminist literature. However, these explorations are subtle and not didactic. While it’s often argued that The Left Hand of Darkness is not Le Guin’s most lyrical writing, this subtle style is distinct and left me with the feeling of ‘they don’t write ‘em like they used to’ – and this is a good thing. There is a strange duality where the Envoy comes from the more utopic society, yet the genderless society of Winter has its own sense of utopia. The sense of it all is hope – hope for the future. Wrapped up in this is the equally interesting presentation of a Cold War between two nations on the planet of Winter, a Cold War on a planet where true war is unknown. Themes run deeper than feminism, hope, and the balance of superpowers and I encourage you to follow that link above to learn more.

It is NOT wrong, or unhealthy to want someone to love and care about you and care for you, and to want to reciprocate. It is only through this kind of openness that we can acheive true intimacy with another individual. And two emotionally healthy people, CAN do this without becoming co-dependent. Unfortunately, abusers violate the trust that this kind of relationship requires, and are incapable of true intimacy. They want you to be dependent. People who ARE capable of genuinely loving you in a healthy and safe way, DON’T WANT TO HURT YOU, and do not DELIBERATELY DO THINGS TO HURT YOU. They don’t play on your insecurities and they don’t wage psychological warfare on you. They don’t blame YOU for all the relationship problems, and they don’t fabricate problems just so you can be the scapegoat.
As a drink it is hard to describe. Indeed I have sat facing my screen for some time now and still not thought of an adequate description. There are orange notes and a slight cord of Christmas - many intermingled spices working in harmony. My oldest friends know of my zeal for the drink. The delicate tea coloured drink (when mixed correctly!) is a triumph of British inventiveness! Indeed I might even go out as far to say I am "known" for my concoctions. (A word of warning for those new to the tipple. It slides down awfully well and one can find themselves rather tispy, rather quickly!)

Car Seat – Chico Key fit 30. This is a great car seat. The baby seems to like it too. She is comfortable and enjoys riding in it. We bought it primarily for it’s security features since we have an older car. The installation was easy and it snaps in and snaps out easily. It is not too heavy and I am able to carry it despite a bad back ache.
This song is structurally beautiful and has a very unique way of drifting between two key centers, C and Eb. It starts off with a refrain over an alternation of C major, C major with a suspended fourth, and the same C major with the suspended fourth and an added flat seventh (all over a C pedal bass). After a few repetitions of this, the harmony breaks away to an Eb major seventh chord. This is then followed by Bb major, which turns out to be the dominant chord in our secondary key of Eb.
As a Teen Institute, it is aimed at, well, teens. Students are able to attend as participants from the summer before their freshmen year of high school until the summer after they graduate. As a participant, teens are placed into two groups: First is a small discussion group of 8-12 teens and two staff members (depending on attendance numbers). The members of the discussion groups generally do not know one another before hand, and the purpose of the groups is to discuss the general sessions and workshops offered each day. The second group is a Community Action Team, and it is the heart and soul of the Illinois Teen Institute. Teens from the same area/school/community/etc work together to come up with a plan to improve their community, utilising the skills and information they have gained at the Institute. The CAT plan is conceived, planned, and carried out by teens, with adult sponsors or volunteer staff members present as resources. (As an aside, Operation Snowball, Inc. was the result of a community action plan from 1978, or thereabouts, that has become an international drug prevention program.)

Sooner than expected, NAMA has this afternoon published its second so-called “Enforcement List” – real estate properties subject to NAMA loans to which receivers have been appointed. The list is available as a non-searchable PDF here – hopefully a more manipulable format will be available here later today. I have extracted here the new property added in the second edition. The list is supposed to be accurate as at 31st July, 2011. (UPDATE: 31st August, 2011. It seems that the new property added – approximately 40 in total – mostly represents Sean Dunne’s, Paddy Kelly’s and the Grehan brothers’ assets)
When Kristin despairs of her own talent and faces the fact that Marshall has used and betrayed her, she creates a “found” Caravaggio–with her own face–that fools the experts. Her intention is to humiliate Marshall but before she can reveal the truth, Marshall sells the nearly finished “restoration” to a highly placed Nazi collector and then prevails on Alice to hide it on her estate until it can be retrieved. Alice wants nothing to do with the painting but Marshall’s discovery of an affair that could wreck her troubled marriage gives him an unshakeable hold over her.

MAC’s beauty powders are limited edition, but it seems like there’s always one in a collection. MAC describe them as “A silky-soft “beauty” powder that’s delicately tinted and luxuriously pearl. Goes on as an ultra-fine shimmering “veil” to the skin. Can be applied as a highlight, soft blush or overall finish.” Play it Proper is “Pastel soft pink with sparkles”, I wouldn’t say its sparkly though – more of a pearly sheen. I’ve been using it mostly as a highlighter but it also works wonderfully as a lightly all-over finishing powder that gives a soft focus, illuminating halo effect. Love it!

Behind each crown and cupcake is a rosette of ribbon. They are so easy and quick to make. I took an 8 inch strip of wired ribbon. I removed the wire from one side of the ribbon and took both ends of the other side and pulled them out to gather the ribbon in the middle of the strip of wire. Then I twisted the two sides together to form a loop. I glued the tips of ribbon that come together and I am done!

The Whispering Forest is a subzone west in Tirisfal Glades. Pre Cataclysm it was just an empty unfinished area. Now it’s a forest with many secrets. There is a big lake with a crashed airplane on the bottom, beside the plane is a gnome-like skeleton. A chest with a skull on can also be found in the lake. On a small island in the lake there is a skeleton with a sword in the back and a fishing pole in the hand. There is also a chair with an umbrella and box of fishing tools. Many rats can be found in the zone and there are stags and fawns in the forrest, the small ones which look plagued or infected by something. I wonder why. The most mysterious thing is a ring of glowing mushrooms in the forest which I will tell you more about.
I wasn’t sure at first what to make of Claire Denis’ White Material (another film JustMeMike and I discussed at length) but after that long conversation and in the intervening months the memory of it has gotten into my central nervous system in the same way The Arbor did — to the point that I put all the rest of Denis’ films on my to-see list. I won’t go into detail again about the film, since you can read our two-part analysis; but just keep in mind how much it grows on you over time.
“At this point, he was in and out of consciousness. They were talking to him, trying to get his name and stuff,” the neighbor said, adding that he recognized the young man as someone he’d seen around the apartment complex.

A second principle that governs an objective interpretation of Scripture is called the sensus literalis.

Second part of our spring break we spent here in Beijing with Nicks family. 5 of nicks family members came over to our Beijing apartment. I finally got the taste of what it is to cook to a big family . I loved it. Nicks family ( sister, her husband , their daugther, and Nicks brothers wife and their 4 year old daughter LELE), ate everything I cooked. They wanted to eat western DIANAS cuisine and they got it. I cooked dishes I usually cook for nick. Slow roasted ribs, Curry Chicken, different potato dishes, different pastas. THEY ALL LOVED IT. I was most impressed by Lele who is 4 years old. SHE ATE MY FOOD. MY FOOD. Are you serious? 4 year old eating my cooking.....lol.... I must be getting better. ;) To be honest, I was little scared when they came to visit us, because I thought they will NOT like western cooking, but they did and I am relieved and happy .

Ray Carbone, Director of Facilities, called Pinnacle Scaffold to rush in and provide emergency overhead and debris protection for pedestrians and students so that work could begin and the school could remain open. Pinnacle was on the job immediately, and worked around the clock to install the necessary scaffolding, overhead protection, and a work platform for the workers to be able to access the burned areas. The school closed for two days while crews started their repairs but then opened again the following week.
In 1929, shortly after Baring's novel The Coat Without Seam had been published, Chesterton wrote that he had been "much uplifted" by his friend's latest book:
diligent search and provided reasonable attribution to the author and copyright owner, then the recommended amendment would limit the remedies available in that infringement action in two primary ways: first, it would limit monetary relief to only reasonable compensation for the use, with an elimination of any monetary relief where the use was noncommercial and the user ceases the infringement expeditiously upon notice. Second, the proposal would limit the ability of the copyright owner to obtain full injunctive relief in cases where the user has transformed the orphan work into a derivative work like a motion picture or book, preserving the user’s ability to continue to exploit that derivative work. In all other cases, the court would be instructed to minimize the harm to the user that an injunction might impose, to protect the user’s interests in relying on the orphan works provision in making use of the work.
What was the adversity? It was the wind. In Ephesians 2:2 Satan is called the “prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.” We consider those two words, “air” and “spirit”. We don’t need to define air but we do “spirit”. It is from the Greek word PNEUMA which also means wind, breath, and yes, spirit. The devil is a spirit creature.
But the ability to make a lot of them did not interest me except as a technical challenge. I learned from some fine printmakers who could do anything and could do it in their best jacket and not get a spot on it.

I have no memory of my mother ever saying those words. No memories of a soft caress on my cheek and a whispered "I love you" or a blanket tucked under my chin and a kiss on my forehead and a "good night, sleep tight, I love you" I don't even have a memory of a hug. But there is was. "I love you" and it was bright, like lightening, it shot straight through me, but then it was floating in the air, just hanging so softly, sweetly and it fell down around my children and rocked me to my core.

Here is the cut, the way that the cricut made it. I used the tag option from the Damask Decor cartridge. Because I had trouble getting the detail cuts to come out at the same size, I ended up just cutting this cupcake apart to create the sections of my mask. If you have an image with separate pieces though, it would be easier to cut the different pieces and the background and then use the layers as the parts of your mask.

By the way, I've noticed that some comments that people have written in my blog yesterday and two days ago went missing...! I think this is due to an error happening to Blogger today. So, please don't think that I deleted your comments...! I never do! This error is actually not that bad, but unfortunately there were people who commented on my Giveaway post during the last two days and I've noticed that these comments are gone...! Yesterday there were 62 comments but it's only 54 today, so 8 comments went missing...:(. I do apologise for this inconvenience (even though I know it is not my fault, but I know you have given some effort to write in my blog and now it's gone without a trace...!). I remember that Minnieh from Food is Delish and TJ from Bento Log wrote some comments letting me know that they wanted to participate in the giveaway, but I am not sure if there were more people who did. Anyway, Minnieh and TJ, I'll enter both of you again in the giveway :)!
There’s a story of an explorer who traveled madly from one edge of South America to the other, getting up before dawn every day and pushing his crew until after sundown. One morning, as he was getting ready for yet another day of busy exploration, his native porters failed to appear. The explorer found them all seated under a tree, not doing anything in particular, but looking as if they were settled in for the better part of the day. He approached them impatiently and demanded an explanation. One of the porters then matter-of-factly replied, “We have traveled far and we have traveled fast. Now we must allow time for our souls to catch up with our bodies.”

Howard publicly blasted his teammates for a second time (first time was against the Boston Celtics) after a loss to the New Orleans Hornets as if he had the moral high ground to do so. Here is a guy that had been talking about wanting out of Orlando, criticizing the efforts of his teammates in public. Did he ever stop to think that they had grown weary of the circus that he had created? All he had to do was keep his mouth shut about his trade demands and the possibility of using his ETO. Instead he behaved completely opposite of the public image he had built for himself prior to this season. He said and did all the wrong things, becoming a cancer in the locker room and within the organization.

The sad reality is that as the number of healthy, young children coming into China's orphanages has declined, waiting families have often migrated to China's Special Needs and Special Focus program. Orphanages have responded to this increased interest by inventing creative means for obtaining children to satisfy this new demand. The following article focuses on one well-known orphanage, but evidence shows that this program is wide-spread (see related links at the conclusion of this article).

Richie and his crew are hard at work. Richie notices them putting a picture of his friend Joey Sodano, up on their target board. Richie opens his mail and finds he's passed the bar exam, but doesn't mention it. Richie questions some of the figures they're putting on the board, suggesting they have no evidence on any of their targets, and that they should take it down and start over from the street. Richie gets $20,000.00 from Toback, and pays a guy to get him some Blue Magic with it. After the dealer gets the money, Richie tails him into a diner New Jersey. Det. Trupo and his man show up at the same place however, and take the bag of money from the dealer. Richie sees this happen and confronts Trup in the street, telling him it's his money and that the bills are registered and sequenced. Trupo grudgingly hands over the money, but threatens Richie, to call ahead if he ever has to come into New York again.

In addition to seeing the horses, we also visited a petroglyph site, saw the Crazy Horse movie set (from a distance), learned more about Native American history, and saw the Sundance ceremony site that the Lakota use every summer.

By the time we left, we certainly knew a lot more about American wild horses than when we arrived! Click here for photos...

Now, to understand how these facts regarding governments complete corporate takeover and management of America, let’s look at current events. Very recently a merger with media conglomerates NBC and Comcast was announced. These are definitely fortune 500 worthy companies. They are therefore already collectively controlled through collective government investments. And they will never let this information (CAFR’s and collective government investments) get out into the public through this government controlled media. Why? Because these media companies are collectively owned through collective government investment!

“For Holiday, I recorded everything in my living room on a laptop and an old micro cassette tape recorder and used a German ghetto blaster as my monitor speakers. The only things I brought with me to Europe were my Powerbook laptop, an effects processor, a small midi keyboard, a microphone, and the hand held micro cassette tape recorder,” he explains. “Because I didn't actually have any instruments with me (aside from the elements I recorded before I came to Europe), the album turned out very electronic, very synthy as those were the only tools I had.”
Take President Obama’s various defenses of health care reform, for example. He only emphasized the justice of the effort after first emphasizing that it would save the country money (and that many prior presidents had failed to fix the health care system). By the time he got around to defending its moral worth, his opponents had conclusively painted health care reform as a dictatorial power grab. Even though conservative rhetoric about “state socialism” and “death panels” was egregiously untrue, it was still a powerful moral indictment of the president’s (alleged) goals. The president explained that health care reform would work, and his opponents replied that it was unjust. Obama carried the votes and still lost the public debate.
