The other day I read with no great surprise that San Francisco is expected to have a $127 million budget surplus by the end of the fiscal year.

The U.S. special envoy for global energy issues, Carlos Pasqual, will visit India later in May to follow up on Clinton's talks, the official said.
President Obama emerged from his ideological closet last week when he said that "same-sex couples should be able to get married." Obama supported same-sex marriage in 1996. He opposed same-sex marriage, however, in 2004 and 2008 and right up until Vice President Joe Biden announced that he was "absolutely comfortable" with same-sex nuptials on "Meet the Press" on Sunday. Thus, I would categorize the president's position on same-sex marriage not as having evolved, as he claims, but as a long-overdue moment of honesty.
Statham is more apt to talk about some of Yakin's other shots. "Bo wanted these extended takes, so there's no room for error" Statham says. "If there's one punch that you miss, you have to go back and do it again. It can be very tiring."

Answer: It’s very surprising. It’s not surprising in the sense that I thought I would do badly, but I’ve tried my best at many things in my life, and I get praise, you know — not regularly but sometimes. The way that people think — “Oh, he’s so wonderful, he’s so amazing, he’s so virtuous” — it’s like, there’s really not any support for that. I’m glad they liked the film, and I’m glad they think I tried hard, and I did try hard to do my best. But in a way, it is surprising because I don’t feel personally that I deserve that level of praise. But they give it to me.

Same goes for the Armenia-occupied Nagorno-Karabagh region, which should not get any aid at all — that's a total waste of money, especially considering that it is used for illegal drug and arms trade by Armenia and Iran. At the same time I urge to sustain funding to Azerbaijan, which is a steadfast ally helping U.S. interests in the region and the Muslim world.

Once again, Romney failed to blow away his opposition, not even hitting 40 percent of the vote in Ohio against three rivals. That's even though a plurality of Republican voters here said their No. 1 desire was a candidate who could beat President Barack Obama; electability, after all, is supposed to be Romney's strong suit. Now the GOP contest moves to Kansas, Mississippi and Alabama -- states where social issues often rule. That could give Santorum a chance to right his ship.

Neither Cindy Schild nor the op-ed writers opposed to the pipeline mention the broader issue, which is that we are past the peak of cheap oil. Oil executives and politicians know this but don't talk about it. (See the film, "The End of Suburbia.") It means that oil extraction in the future will become more and more expensive and require environmentally more destructive techniques such as tar sands extraction. Yes, we will need to continue to extract oil and natural gas for years to come, but investment in renewal energy sources by both the private sector and our government should be the focus.

San Diego history is also the story of political (and cultural) activists who've battled back against the reactionary mindset, real estate-run political machine, and nightstick justice of America's Finest City. San Diego's climate of anti-intellectualism, far-right conservatism, good-ole-boy bigotry, and evangelical no-nothingism made me value radical thought as a real and present threat to the enemies of progressive change.
Italians are famous for lingering over their exquisite meals, and Pietro Marcello lingers deliciously in this documentary as he establishes the lives and relationship of a serial jailbird named Enzo, who grew up on the tough streets of Genoa and has just been released from jail again. You hear his voice describing his hardscrabble childhood and you hear the voice of his wife. By the end of the film, when we meet Mary and hear about how they met, we can't help believing we're witnessing a great marriage, albeit not an Italian "Ozzie and Harriet" union.

They arrived hours later than expected due to multiple punctured tires, but agreed the trip was amazing.
Franklin, a 50-year-old divorced mother of two, is exactly the type of empty nester to whom downtown developers market their pricey condominiums and apartments.

That sent the euro lower against the dollar. A stronger dollar makes it more expensive for other countries to buy U.S. exports, hurting U.S. companies that sell goods abroad.

Those casinos are monuments to human risk-taking, so it might have seemed appropriate to set up the Flaming Lips, one of the few forward-looking bands at the Caravan (and one of the few to use synthesizers) right in front of the skyline. But Wayne Coyne's act retreated to the safety of the known, too. Along with the Lips, he attempted an album-length cover of Pink Floyd's "The Dark Side of the Moon," with songs from "The Wizard of Oz" spliced in for comic relief, and to suggest that the band is aware of Internet memes.

It could not have been good for the turtles.

Gerhardt finally paid compliments to his cellist colleagues by joining the section for a powerful, rhythmically charged reading of Anton Dvorák's Symphony No. 9 ("From the New World"). The orchestra has played the work more recently than they've done the Prokofiev – Kalmar programmed it in his first OSO season – and the performance was a good example of what an orchestra can get out of fine-tuning already familiar music. Ensemble was tight, energy high and phrases carefully shaped; there were numerous fine contributions from section to section, and English hornist Kyle Mustain's second-movement solos were heart melting and lovely.

So that's it, huh? The 2011 regular season is over, just like that. It's been a fun ride, with Atholton emerging as the dominant team in Howard County, River Hill rebounding from two early season setbacks to finish near the top, Glenelg surprising almost everyone, Long Reach's high-powered offense putting on a show just about every week, Howard being consistent, steady old Howard, Hammond and Reservoir starting off strong but faltering down the stretch and Wilde Lake struggling through a bit of a state championship hangover (figuratively of course). Mt. Hebron, Centennial, Marriotts Ridge and Oakland Mills also played football this fall.

Her father, Dean, and his brothers, Brian and Mitch, were all Olympic-caliber throwers.
