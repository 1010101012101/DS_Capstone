After Greece, the next big concern in the markets is that the contagion that spread from Athens to Dublin and on to Lisbon could soon hit Madrid.

Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the pro-reform Drug Policy Alliance, told me that while Mexico's move is encouraging, it would be a mistake to expect the results to replicate Portugal's exactly. Portugal prepared the ground with a thorough commission report and achieved commitment from law enforcement, while Mexico decriminalized smaller amounts, still has a culture of corruption, and may be less prepared to implement the new law, especially when it comes to offering treatment.

Morain's biggest issue, however, is the actual wording of the California Right to Know Genetically Modified Food Act, which could potentially bar companies from calling any product "natural" if it has been subject to "canning, smoking, pressing, cooking, freezing, dehydration, fermentation or milling." As Morain noted, such wording could prevent olive oil manufacturers or rice companies from labeling their products as natural, since olives are pressed and rice is milled.

It was also to make the tent bigger. All the circus acts you will see in Vancouver got started when mogul skiing and short track speed skating finished their tryout period as demonstration sports in Calgary. Beginning in 1992, the IOC sanctioned a growing number of "freestyle" snow events. Americans are quite good at individual expression. The new events were a highway to heaven, providing instant American contenders and a boost to the TV ratings in the critical U.S. market.
The people who knew Trungpa do not necessarily defend what he did, they simply say this was who he was, a teacher who chose unnerving methods to open minds.

"It's never easy to lose the first game of a playoff series, especially at home. That's why I say they're going to come out desperate. We expect that. I think they're going to work on things just like we're going to go over things, go over video, and it's going to be a totally different game."

The service, like the food, has a new energy since the remodel. The staff maintains a crisp, professional edge, although at times they can be so attentive that they border on intrusive.

My thoughts are with the victims and families of this catastrophe in Japan. The Japanese are showing the world their courage and resilience. Every image increases my respect for them.

The unanimous ruling from the three-judge panel so incensed opponents of Kyleigh’s Law, which took effect last May, that they vowed an immediate appeal to state Supreme Court.

Whoever replaces Straub will walk into a budget buzzsaw. The director initiated a firestorm among council members last month when he disclosed that public safety was projecting a $15.1 million deficit by year's end.

Once again, the dazzle of the new "Sherlock" series is how the writers adhere adoringly to the original texts, while entirely modernizing them at the same time. As impossible as that may seem, Moffat, Gatiss and fellow writer Steve Thompson pull it off so deftly, it is useful to listen carefully to the seeming asides and throwaway lines to appreciate just how brilliant it is.

Young, now 26, needs to grow up. Aside from potentially damaging his reputation for, at the very least, putting himself in a needlessly embarrassing situation, Young might have compromised his marketability since this is his contract season.

One of the important virtues of the consent agreement is the extent to which it will provide a more certain financial footing for the council's policy-making decisions. Revenue will no longer be a matter of hope-for guessing and conjecture. Budgeting will be tied to firm -- and independent -- revenue estimates. Both the mayor and council will be forced to live within actual financial constraints, even after budget documents are adopted.

Located close to SBC Park, it's a good pregame spot and sports bar, with several TV sets. But it also puts out the welcome mat for the masses of computer programmers who live in the area.

Make sure the kit contains supplies for cuts and scrapes and aspirin. "Kits are priced by how many items they have. But in some, most of the items are bandages. A lot of them just have too many bandages," Whitaker said. He recommended against beginners building a kit; kits will have instructions on outdoor first aid and adding pieces would be pricier than a kit.

In 2007, Mann challenged the county's valuation of the properties. The county will not foreclose on a property while a tax-value challenge is pending before the Board of Revision.

But the ultimate authority doesn't sit with the governing body of college athletics. Rather, it's Ducks fans who spend their money on tickets and donations and root until their throats burn. If that's you, you're a shareholder at Oregon. So far, the most vocal fans have been the ones defending the Ducks at all costs.

A dusty half-hour drive later, we arrived at our destination: a gleaming white stupa encircled by the bright, primary colors of Tibetan prayer flags. The temple, consecrated in December by the Tibetan cultural association Garuda Mexico, is the tallest in the Western Hemisphere, my guides claimed. It's a point of pride among locals -- although they seemed bewildered when asked why it was built here, on an unmarked, agave-lined dirt road, surrounded by miles of pine forests, far from any likely visitors. Still, they stood in awe of the sacred structure, with its stark white steps, intricate and brightly colored awning and golden Buddha in its crown. It's "a very peaceful place," declared Eva, herself a Catholic. I agreed. But it was the temple's mysteriously far-flung location that intrigued me the most.

As Allied ground forces closed in, Roth said his German captors shed their uniforms and melted away into the civilian population, leaving their prisoners free to wander into the American lines.

The mostly white-plumaged bird is North America's only stork species. Standing about 3 feet tall, the lanky, bald-headed bird feeds by wading with its long, opened beak partially submerged, snapping it shut when it touches a small fish or other prey. It often shuffles its feet and flashes its beautiful black-and-white wings to stir up potential prey, which are then captured. Though it is gawky-looking on land, the bird is a graceful flier with its neck and long legs stretched straight out.

Lucy Walker, who directed the excellent Amish-teens-go-wild documentary, "Devil's Playground," returns with the uneven but deeply touching story of how the German directors of a Tibetan school for the blind persuaded Weihenmayer to take six teenage students up a 23,000-foot Himalayan peak. The mountain-climbing scenes are actually only of mild interest. The film's best parts involve the personal stories of the students, each of whom has a degree of frailty yet is determined to show their families and countrymen their worth as human beings. Walker's film is a sure tearjerker, but the sentiments aren't cheap.

High concern in rural communities over proposed cuts has been a principal barrier to the cost-cutting effort, with residents in the sprawling and remote areas expressing fears about their ability to get timely mail delivery of prescription drugs, newspapers and other services.

I was equally impressed with a pasta ($12/$21). The handmade egg fettuccine draped over the fork like a satin ribbon, flavored with a ragout of oxtail meat, precise dices of still crunchy carrots and whole nearly raw peas and shavings of Parmesan.

There's no healthier, more delicious way I know to start a meal than with a chilled plate or bowl piled high with fresh, colorful, crisp, and tender leaves and other vegetables, complemented by a vinaigrette or other quickly prepared, brightly seasoned dressing. Salads excite the appetite without overwhelming it, leaving you ready to enjoy the rest of the meal that follows. Yet, they also help fill you up while providing important nutrients, playing a role in successful weight maintenance and vibrant health.

To be absolutely clear, the six investigators involved did nothing wrong. They followed proper procedures in seeking approval for the trip. The conference provided solid educational programs; Asian gang activity is a concern here. Forfeited funds from drug busts and other dealings paid for the conference. While not technically taxpayer dollars, forfeited funds belong to the public.

Kelly won the Pacific-10 Conference championship in his first season. And in his second, he's earned a berth to the Bowl Championship Series title game. And I'm thinking things are moving so fast for Kelly that if he toured the Vatican next summer on vacation, I would not be the least bit surprised if the bishops and cardinals announced they're scrapping traditional mass for the spread-option on Sundays.

"It's almost like the lead-up to Apollo, in my mind," said Mike Horkachuck, NASA's project executive for SpaceX. "You had Mercury then you had Gemini and eventually you had Apollo. This would be similar in the sense that, we're not going to the moon or anything as spectacular as that, but we are in the beginnings of commercializing space. This may be the Mercury equivalent to eventually flying crew and then eventually leading to, in the long run, passenger travel in space."
THE ISSUE: Many of us this weekend will celebrate the 235th anniversary of independence from the British with fireworks, barbecue and block parties. While offering a respite from politics, the holiday is also an occasion to reflect on whether we've strayed too far from the spirit of 1776. Is the government too big? Are the laws tyrannical?

As the season has worn on this version of the Rebels isn't just the best Priory team. It's the best soccer team in town and, one could argue, the state. Priory pinned an 8-0 whooping on rival Whitfield Saturday morning. The Warriors, the kings of Class 1, are in the midst of a rebuilding year. But the Rebels did things that impressed the opposing coach.

(Oregon’s offensive line averages 302 pounds.) Center Peter Konz (6-foot-5, 315 pounds) and guard Kevin Zeitler (6-4, 315) both earned all-America recognition for the Badgers, who also have a first-team all-Big Ten selection in tackle Josh Oglesby (6-7, 330).

It was 3 o'clock in the morning when she found him, says Taylor, who asked to be identified by her first name only. She called 9-1-1 and the ambulance came to take him away. He never woke up.

(On what he thinks of McCoy's strength and accuracy and how much of it becomes a mental issue and how much of it is other things surrounding the offense)- "I think that's overstated a little bit. He's missed a couple throws and every quarterback in the league misses a couple throws. From a technical standpoint when a quarterback, Colt's no different, when that has happened to him, two things. One, either pressure forces feet or his mechanics into a little different thing so he misses the throw or his footwork caused the ball to be delivered a certain way. You can't point to too many times when he's got a guy open and he miss fires on them. We run a lot of crossing routes and it's one of the tougher balls to throw right on the money, particularly if you're getting pressured at all. That is not a worry for me. His strength and accuracy I think are just fine."

In a few years, as Pujols' skills continue to erode, Cardinals fans will look back on the loss of Albert with the same fondness as they look back at the team's failed pursuits of Mike Hampton, Jason Schmidt and Brian Fuentes. Great job by DeWitt and "Mo" of keeping the long-term interests of the franchise in focus. I am confident Cardinal baseball will survive (and thrive) without Albert.

KEY TO THE GAME: Kansas has to hope Davis misses curfew and is benched for the first half (fat chance) or that he gets in foul trouble as he did in Kentucky's December loss at Indiana. Kansas' 7-foot center, Jeff Withey, must change the dynamic of the game with his shot-blocking and not allow Kentucky free passage in the paint. Kansas guard Tyshawn Taylor must find his outside shooting touch — he is 0 for 20 from three-point range in the tournament — and avoid the kind of late-game brain cramps that almost cost Kansas a semifinal win over Ohio State.

Since taking over at Real's Santiago Bernabeu stadium, Mourinho's Madrid had defated Barcelona just once in 10 attempts—and that victory came in extra-time in last year's Spanish Cup final. In a normal 90-minute game, the record was 0-5-5. Whatever mitigation Mourinho might have had for the fact that this Barcelona team is widely regarded as one of the greatest in the history of the game is off-set, at least partially, by the fact that his team is the most expensive ever assembled and that he is the highest paid coach in soccer—and possibly in all of sports.
— Alan Rickman as Severus Snape: Probably the most fascinating figure in the Potter world because of his shifting alliances and an emotional depth that's unexpected given his icy demeanor.

A half-blood wizard, Snape has been a minion of the evil Lord Voldemort as well as an ally of Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore. He's served as the intimidating Defense Against the Dark Arts professor and eventually headmaster himself but he's also been a protector of Harry. Snape bullies his students but he also reveals his bravery, and in this final film, a flashback that explains his history with the young wizard provides one of its most poignant scenes.

In the documentary, Senna talks about the feeling he experienced racing - of losing himself inside the machine. Like many sports stars (and rock stars, too), he talks about his relationship with God.

For most of my ride I basked in muted sunshine, perfect shorts weather. My eyes canvassed broad vistas that spread in every direction: granite peaks sliced by snow-choked ravines, sprawling lakes edged by pine trees. I was so focused on Canada's scenery that, when ascending one gentle rise, I almost overlooked a small grizzly foraging in the wildflowers mere inches from the asphalt. I circled around to get a better look, but another of the cyclists came alongside and scolded me.

Not having to win public approval for the sales tax plan should make it easier for Ramsey County to come up with its $350 million share of the stadium financing plan, but several legislative leaders have indicated they would prefer such a vote be held.

When you need hot appetizers, design miniature pizzas. Start with a favorite tomato sauce, which you can enliven by adding red pepper flakes, anchovies or a dab of horseradish. Top the sauce with sauteed onions and some cheese to hold everything in place - grated Parmesan with mozzarella is a good choice. A few minutes in a moderate oven is all it takes to melt the cheese.
"So much research out there shows that immunizations work and just trigger the body to develop antibodies.

What's amazing is the shortsightedness displayed by some of the big-boy leagues. The Big 12, for, instance, is trying to add either West Virginia or Louisville. If the leaders of that league had any vision, they would add UCF and USF in a package deal and seize a TV and marketing foothold across Florida's Interstate 4 corridor from Tampa to Orlando to Daytona Beach.
Other teams in the league are the Cleveland Crush, Philadelphia Passion, Tampa Breeze, Toronto Triumph, Orlando Fantasy, Los Angeles Temptation, Minnesota Valkyrie, Seattle Mist, Green Bay Chill, Vegas Sun and Chicago Bliss.

But most insiders assumed that Richard Bean’s “One Man, Two Guvnors,” a Benny Hill-ified version of the commedia dell’arte-inspired classic “The Servant of Two Masters,” would nab the fourth slot, even though the producers of this uproarious British farce had petitioned the Tony rule-makers to be considered in the revival category, presumably to give the show a better shot at winning. The request was not only rejected but David Ives’ “Venus in Fur” was nominated instead, giving patriots a reason to cheer but comedy lovers another reason to gripe that the genre just doesn’t get any respect at awards time.

Echo Park, a blue-collar Latino neighborhood for decades, keeps getting trendier and more affluent. Start with a stroll around the Echo Park Lake — if there's water in it. (City officials plan to drain it for repairs, perhaps as soon next month.) Cruise the aged ladies of Carroll Avenue — that is, drive past the greatest concentration of well-tended Victorian homes in Los Angeles, seven blocks south of Sunset by way of Douglas Street. And walk Sunset between Echo Park Boulevard (where a striking Ricardo Mendoza mural wraps around a clinic building) and Taix (pronounced "tex"), the long-enduring French restaurant (1911 Sunset Blvd.) where Park Avenue comes to an end. You'll find stalwarts such as the Echo Park Pawn Shop (1702 Sunset Blvd.) and Pescado Mojado seafood (1701 Sunset Blvd.) jostled by newcomers such as the bookshop-café Stories (1716 Sunset Blvd.). The Echo and its downstairs sibling the Echoplex (1822 Sunset Blvd. and 1154 Glendale Blvd., respectively) are two of the city's leading venues for live rock music. El Prado (1805 Sunset Blvd.), once a dive bar, is now downright genteel (and plays mostly old vinyl on its sound system). On Thursday nights, the nonprofit Echo Park Film Center (1200 N. Alvarado St.) screens alternative and/or documentary films, asking only a $5 donation. But before the day gets away, you need to hit the storefront labeled Echo Park Time Travel Mart (1714 Sunset Blvd.) In the rooms behind, tutors from the 826LA organization (another nonprofit, part of a national network founded by author Dave Eggers) offer free academic help and writing workshops for students ages 6 to 18. Upfront, the outfit raises funds by selling supplies for time-travelers — like robot milk ($19.99 a bottle) and centurion helmets ($99.99 each). If you pretend this is all normal, the clerk at the counter will too.

At its core are competing philosophies about the role of government and the rights of parents and children. On one side is the belief that government's role should be limited, in terms of the help it provides to struggling families and the power it gives CPS to separate families. The other side argues for more funding for services to help keep families together, as well as additional support for CPS to help children who must be removed for their safety.
