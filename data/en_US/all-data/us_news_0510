It's a twist on traditional vertical well fracking, and has brought environmental concerns, particularly in Pennsylvania where several groups of residents are suing, claming their water wells were contaminated by the process. In one instance, Pennsylvania environmental regulators have sided with residents, ordering one energy company to provide potable water and gas mitigation to citizens in Dimock whose wells were damaged by drilling.
DV retired after the Super Bowl, and Martz was promoted to head coach. He was also a risk. No one doubted Martz's brilliance as an offensive coordinator, but could he handle the pressure of coaching, and the outside forces that cause the stress level to soar? The players loved Martz, who set high standards. The offense continued its spectacular run. Martz went 53-32 and got the 2001 Rams back to the Super Bowl, where he promptly got upset by New England -- in large part because of his refusal to run the ball with Faulk after the Patriots lined up in nickel and dime defenses. Martz was never really the same after that, and cracked during an insidious political battle with team executive Jay Zygmunt. The Greatest Show on Turf ended way too soon -- killed off by burning egos and hideous drafts. Sad.

Parise kept coming at the Florida Panthers in this 4-0 victory, setting the tone for everyone to follow.

"My guess is that when lawmakers were creating these exemptions, they were thinking of the middle-income science teacher who retires and suddenly needs to go back to work for a bit because of an emergency shortage in teachers," said Marcia Fritz, president of the California Foundation for Fiscal Responsibility. "I can't believe that the purpose of these exemptions was so people could earn hundreds of thousands of dollars in extra pay at taxpayer expense. Retirement means retirement."

The Sprechers, whose last film was 2002's festival favorite, "Thirteen Conversations About One Thing," which also featured Arkin, are fond of ensemble pieces with lots of interlocking action. They take time to mine the psychological and the physical world the characters have been dropped into. For "Thin Ice," the filmmakers have gone back to familiar turf (Jill graduated from the University of Wisconsin) and captured the sensibility of small-town life there with its limitless horizons and limited opportunities. The bitter winter is a good staging ground for delivering this bitter pill, with their "Thirteen Conversations" cinematographer Dick Pope ("The Illusionist") helping them make the most of the icy vistas.
"It's just powerful," she said. "There are so few people who have the ability to go to space, and for all of us to be here on the river, watching it launch and feeling it rise and feeling the wind, you feel like you're a part of it. You feel connected."

NEW YORK — John Mara knows not to get overly emotional about wins. He understands the week-to-week volatility of the NFL, and that a big win against the Philadelphia Eagles could be dampened by a poor performance against the Cardinals. So Mara, the Giants' president, is not any more confident than he already was about his team.
Yet the U.S. still was a visitor at these games, confirmed by a Coal Harbor foghorn that played the first four notes of "O Canada" when the home team won a medal. And Canada planned to win often.

“Tom is a terrific, terrific coach who does a lot of things very well, but one of the very best things he does is pace our team, knowing when to put the pedal to the metal and when to back off,” Forman said. “I think he’s shown that with how he’s paced our team the last couple of years — when is the time to go hard in practice, when is the time not to go hard and when it’s time to give guys days off. To me, it’s one of the biggest strengths he has as a coach.”
Skinner, a noted Portland choreographer, isn't in a Moscow ballroom bossing around 19th-century Russian aristocrats.

Like all summer storms, this one was occasionally turbulent. Lead guitarist Jim Babjak couldn’t hear himself at first, and spent much of the beginning of the set gesturing toward his monitors in futility. The problem was fixed, but his guitar was never quite as loud as it should have been — which meant that a few of the instrumental sections didn’t provide the tilt-a-whirl thrill that they should have. Babjak (or his soundman) found his footing midway through the concert, and his soloing on "Only a Memory" and "Time and Time Again" pulled the song into psychedelic territory befitting a festival named after Woodstock.

"You are about 50 times as likely to get struck by lightning as to win the lottery, based on the 90 people a year getting struck by lightning," Catalano said. "Of course, if you buy 50 tickets, you've equalized your chances of winning the jackpot with getting struck by lightning."
Hollingsworth took one of each kind, broke each apart to feel for texture, nodded, then threw them into the garbage. I had to restrain myself from diving in after them - they looked as if they had just come out of the oven. I thought, What if they aren't good enough? Can he tell them to bake new bread? Does he have the power to warp time?

Because students are not randomly assigned to classrooms, test scores are a poor measure of teachers’ performance, said Jesse Rothstein, an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley. It’s common for principals to assign a group of unruly students to one teacher and a group of highly intelligent students to another.
Despite initial media accounts of "Resilience" ("After I cried and screamed, I went to the bathroom and threw up"), and the much-talked about Oprah interview Thursday, Edwards' battle with cancer and Wade's death dominate the new book, even more so than her 2006 memoir, "Saving Graces: Finding Solace and Strength From Friends and Strangers." "Resilience," in fact, can be viewed as a coda to "Saving Graces" -- a meditation on her life after learning about her husband's affair and the resurgence of her cancer.

Moreover, the system may actually dissuade asylum-seekers from playing by the rules. Instead of applying at the border, the two-tier system encourages some to cross it illegally and apply once they're inside the country, where they more likely will be allowed to remain free while their hearings are scheduled. And the system is expensive. The average daily cost of detaining an immigrant is upward of $100, while alternatives to detention, such as electronic monitoring, are far cheaper.

As the master plan already mandated knitting the site back into the street grid around the site, replacing streets that had been erased by the World Trade Center's raised superblock in the 1970s, lifting the memorial also allowed it to flow directly into the surrounding neighborhood.

During their 1974 tour of South Africa, the British & Irish Lions were not going to be intimidated—in fact, quite the reverse. When a player was targeted by the Springboks, he would shout "99," a call to arms for Lions players, triggering a mass retaliation by his teammates. The Lions' thought process: "If the referee sends one of us off, he'll have to send all of us off." It worked.

There were scuffles all over the field, sparked by the "99" call.

He also touted the endorsement of Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who wrote language for laws such as Arizona's.

That said, this first run at budget-making has gone relatively smoothly. Fitzgerald presented a budget that maintains key services despite significantly reduced state revenue, in part because he has spent the past year reorganizing county operations and trimming staff by about 6 percent. He also has put aside money for economic development and other initiatives and to keep a solid cash reserve. The latter is key to raising the county's bond rating, a goal that will translate into lower interest rates and free up money for other uses. For its part, council resisted the temptation to pork up the budget with special pleadings and through public hearings put forward some worthy ideas. Give and take is part of the democratic process, and the new government's maiden budget voyage is more proof that the voters who embraced reform in 2009 got it right.

Another friend, a bit of a skeptic by nature, wondered why God would need such good abs. "Would he be any less awesome with a big, flabby gut?" That's a good question, too. In fact, human nature being what it is, a civilization of flabby people should envision a flabby God - one who is like unto ourselves. We like crafting God in our own image. So I suppose I can understand why a ripped, Gold's Gym kind of guy would be all stoked about God with a six pack. But that doesn't make it so. Unless, maybe, he was talking metaphorical abs. There are plenty of places in scripture that use physical imagery when speaking of God. If we were to take them all literally, not only would God have a face, arms, hands and feet, but also wings, and breasts for nursing.

Also, a positive test would require a colonoscopy to further evaluate.

This was supposed to be the season the Blazers' finally put everything together and emerged as a contender in the Western Conference.

In general St. Louis art collectors have an eclectic appreciation of art from ancient works to cutting edge contemporary, and that is not too different than other large cities.

You can dine in grand style or cheerfully deconstruct the way you're eating. The menu is but an access point, an ever-changing springboard into your own culinary expression. So you can come here on, say, a Monday and grab some fabulous mussels, a Belgian Trappist ale and some good bread with an olive oil deeply redolent of its Sicilian orchard. On Tuesday, perhaps, it's a platter heaped with eggy noodles mingled with powerfully braised lamb and cerignola olives for the whole table, plus varied wines by the glass from a small but smart list. Come back on Friday with three friends and have four courses spread out over a couple of hours, with four bottles of wine.

Heyward workout: Heyward worked out for NFL talent evaluators Wednesday after his recovery from elbow surgery kept him from taking part in Ohio State's Pro Day three weeks ago. About 25 teams were represented, with the Pittsburgh Steelers sending coach Mike Tomlin and defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau.

Use of her right arm and leg is limited but improving, he says - a common effect of a bullet wound on the left side of the brain. She pushes a grocery cart up and down the hospital halls as therapy, focusing on using the correct muscles, says nurse Kristy Poteet, who has worked with Giffords since she arrived in Houston on Jan. 21.

Price to sell. Gauging a home's value is different now. A real estate agent will pinpoint a home's market value based on its features, location and comparable listings in the area. Setting the price too high can leave a home languishing on the market. A too-low price will deprive the seller of well-earned equity.
Cleveland Hammonds Jr., who died Tuesday at age 75, possessed such qualities. Mr. Hammonds, a Louisiana native who grew up in Alton, served as superintendent of the city schools from 1996 to 2003, an impossibly long run by today's standards. He was the last of the old-style superintendents, and his tenure offers lessons about the district that still are worth heeding.
“If you don’t have any other solution, you have to tackle,” Collin said. “Maybe I was late, but thank god I was able to tackle and win the ball.

Along with producer Dot Da Genius, Cudder is fronting a rock project titled 2 Be Continuum (clearly the music isn’t the only problem), and their first offering is a swirling mess. Cudi’s vocals — including a new, perplexing rock accent — are trapped under Black Sabbath guitar tones and sweeping strings. It’s three minutes of rambling, with a primary focus on creating a dank mood. Too bad that “mood” is the audio equivalent of trapping a listener in a soaked cardboard box with no exit. We’re at the mercy of Cudi’s vaguely existential lyrics (“Safety is the word / it’s the main thing the lost souls want”), asking ourselves, “Wasn’t this the guy that did ‘Day N Nite’?” On Twitter, Cudi takes a predictable stance: If you want his old sound, buy his old albums. For him, this is about artistic evolution. It’s a cute, tightly wrapped defense but it’s exclusionary, leaving a huge chunk of fans that connected with his idiosyncratic rapping in that cardboard box. You’re either with him and his new rock vision, or you’re not. And if you’re not, you don’t support the Artist, as if blind following should be the listener’s pre-set prerogative.

"I think we see failure as a negative thing in our culture, and I don't see it as a negative thing. I think failure is a sign that you tried to do something that is challenging and you didn't know how to do, and that to me is a good thing.

The lone returning starter is Ryan Johnson, a 6-3 forward who averaged eight points a game last year.

Coma and 40 years young aside, my kids' monthly premiums have always cost far less than mine.

While the indictment does not suggest that most of the drugs were shipped or stored improperly, it does describe one incident of a cold pack rupturing in a Nisar shipment in 2010, and Newcomb's response.

The racks and display cases at the 1,900-square-foot Deja Blue are filled with the kind of clothing and accessories you'd expect to find in the upscale Cherry CreekNorth neighborhood, but don't let the fancy surroundings fool you. Deja Blue is a happy place, a shopwhere you can look at the price tags and smile, not drop the item like it's hot. Deja Blue is a riff on deja vu, which is French for the feeling of having already witnessed or experienced something that is happening right now. In this case, however, it means that everything in Deja Blue has had a previous life. Right down to the fixtures.

THREE STARS NV Roederer Estate Anderson Valley Brut ($24) Roederer's wines are defined by a sharpness that comes from almost no malolactic fermentation. Unlike most of the California bruts, this is heavier on the Chardonnay -- 60 percent to 40 percent Pinot Noir, with a small amount of reserve wine added. A sweet, woodsy note on the nose, like candy in a cedar forest, with sweet apple and nectarine, then a yeasty note that emerges in its middle. Balanced and biting, with a gripping ending.
Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts said the proposals are just part of the governor’s larger plan to reshape Medicaid, which faces a $1 billion shortfall next year even with $240 million in planned cuts.

So what was perhaps most unusual about "Crane Palimpsest," part of the final program in Jeffrey Kahane's 15th season as LACO music director, is that the score was conducted by the composer's father.

Performances begin March 9, 2012."Do not go gentle into that good night," Dylan Thomas wrote. "Old age should burn and rave at close of day." Norman Thayer, Jr. who's about to turn 80, doesn't rave and burn, exactly: His manner of dealing with impending death is by talking about it a lot, and making wry jokes about it, unsettling everyone around him. In Ernest Thompson's popular play "On Golden Pond," currently at Lakewood Theatre, it's 1979, and Norman (Tobias Andersen) and his wife Ethel (Jane Fellows) are at their cottage in Maine for the summer, a nostalgic place where memories surface, and some are plainly forgotten.
The route got complicated as I rounded Milan, leading me to realize that it's better to look for destination signs than to try to follow incessantly changing route numbers. It rained off and on. Highway entrance ramps were hair-raisingly short, and I was occasionally tailgated by a Mario Andretti.

This is the essential question the Rams face as they prepare for that first-round pick and it's not a simple decision. I don't know what their draft board looks like or if they think Blackmon is a difference-maker wide receiver with the potential to become a Larry Fitzgerald type, or if he will fall just a notch below to the Dwayne Bowe level. If the Rams believe he will ultimately develop into another Fitzgerald, then I say take him at No. 6. If he is viewed as the Bowe type, then I would certainly try to move down in the draft, pick up another extra second-round pick and build some overall depth on the roster.

One nice feature of the show is the way it deals with all this relatively arcane cosmology. If you don't know your Tlaloc from your Tonatiuh or your Xolotl from your Xochipilli, never mind a quechquémitl from a huipil, it's as easy to get lost in Mesoamerican metaphysics as it is in the philosophical soap operas enacted on Mount Olympus.

Really, though, plates are meant to enhance traditional exercise, with or without free weights. I tried a whole range of standard drills— pushups, dips, planks — and all of them were harder than usual on the plate, especially in the 30- to 60-second bursts Makowski advised.

On the other hand, the business world of the show is better suited to Bacharach and David than to younger sounds. And other aspects of the era have held up.

But my brother, who left office in 1993, was also the last Asian American to sit on the council. How could that be in a city that has grown more multiracial and, if you believe the polls, more tolerant, over the last two decades? Several Asian Americans plan to pitch their hats into the ring next year, but until one wins, I remain on guard. What historian Carey McWilliams once said of America is certainly true of our city: It is "the sum of the tensions between its older and new immigrants, whether they came from Europe or south of the border or across the Pacific." We still haven't solved the equation.

We eat a fair amount of tomatoes in my house. Usually we just have them raw, cut in thick slices or pretty wedges, dressed in balsamic and olive oil or simply seasoned with a touch of black pepper. Even the 2-year-old likes them, popping halves of grape tomatoes like they were, well, grapes.
Dish Network, based in Englewood, Colo., is trying to expand beyond TV into Internet access, video and other services, both for homes and on mobile devices. Last year, it bought Blockbuster out of bankruptcy.
Verizon Wireless and Sprint both said through representatives that battery life should improve as 4G LTE network upgrades reduce the need for phones to search for a signal. An AT&T spokesman declined to comment.

WASHINGTON, D.C. The Ohio State Medical Association, which represents a majority of doctors in Ohio, this afternoon announced its opposition to the current health care reform bill working its way rapidly through the U.S. House of Representatives.
Everton was denied victory at Britannia Stadium when striker Cameron Jerome scored in the 69th minute for Stoke, canceling out Peter Crouch’s own goal a minute before halftime — the 1,000th goal in the Premier League this season.
ø Sonic is a good car: useful, easy to drive, a good value. It's just not the high-class, scintillating little scooter we were expecting. For many buyers, though, it could hit the sweet spot.
It was shaping up as a remarkable turnabout from 2008, when Obama helped propel Democrats to big gains in their House majority only two years after the 2006 wave that swept them to control. This year, few Democratic incumbents felt safe, least of all the 51 who claimed Republican seats over the last four years.
No matter how the ball is held, the pitcher then pushes it toward home plate instead of letting it roll off the fingers.
"Kovy's able to put a puck in a situation that people don't have a really good look at, because he cradles it in his stick and he is almost going away from the play," Devils goalie Martin Brodeur said. "He has that great vision.
After insurers suffered massive losses on mortgage bonds, they largely withdrew from the muni-bond market. That attracted yield-hungry investors, who bought up uninsured bonds with higher payouts, experts say. Yields hit 3.4% on 10-year Triple A rated munis last January.
Gloria Justice was one of those invited alumni. She and her daughter, who are both teachers, were wearing vintage hats once owned by Gloria Justice's mother, Ameadow Cason. They sported the hats just for that event and they hoped they could wear them again for Derby Day.
In the end, I was grateful for the company. Just as runners rely on the support of spectators and fellow racers, I'm not sure I would have made it 42,195 meters without the camaraderie of six other individuals and eight relay teams in the same figurative boat. Without them, I might not have finished in a Boston Marathon-qualifying time of three hours and ten minutes.

Police did not have a way to contact Kotelman and no current phone listing could be found.
Eileen Brady, Charlie Hales and Jefferson Smith each tried to distinguish themselves in the nonpartisan race. But asked about Brady's self-described but challenged role as a New Seasons co-founder, Hales' decision to pay taxes in Washington while continuing to vote in Oregon, and Smith's track record of missing paperwork deadlines, they demurred.
Another unresolved issue involves about $200 million in air services subsidies to rural communities. The program was created when airlines were deregulated in 1978 to ensure continued air service on less profitable routes to isolated communities. The House long-term FAA bill would eliminate the program except for airports in Alaska.
The city elections office has until Feb. 12 to certify Cornett.
But Clementi, a shy 18-year-old from Ridgewood apparently didn’t get the joke and emailed a formal complaint to a Rutgers resident assistant about the invasion of privacy, the former R.A. testified last week.
Dunham taps a strain of self-loathing beneath the boldness. Ancient feminists may wonder how she can be ruthless about the humiliations and failures of herself as Hannah, the main character, and still be proudly female-centric? It's not post-feminist or anti-feminist, it's a kind of neo-feminist in which women are so sure of their standing, they don't mind slumming.
She watched as earth-moving and construction equipment moved into a nearby field. It was 1956 and crews were getting ready to build Crestwood Plaza, one of the region's first shopping centers.
Why United initially refused my request for a refund when its contract of carriage calls for a refund because of the increased flight time is a mystery to me. But it proves again the moral of the story: Be proactive.
The 60 year-old actor is perhaps best known for portraying John Travolta's best friend Kenickie in the 1978 film adaptation of the musical "Grease." After the film, Conaway went on to co-star in the popular and acclaimed sitcom "Taxi," as Bobby Wheeler, an out of work actor who moonlights as a taxi-driver.
A. Likely, yes. Teachers who do not go on strike are not expected to be able to teach their own class. School administrators will redistribute all available personnel to maximizes resources, according to the district. The teachers union is telling teachers who cross the picket line to expect to be in a different classroom with different students, and perhaps at a different school site.
To Bloom who wrote "American Wasteland: How America Throws Away Half of Its Food," that statistic is oddly "empowering because, as we've seen with recycling, when people wrap their mind around a simple environmental behavior change, that change can make an impact."
Over and over, she descended a series of steps by bouncing with a thud on her buttocks.
Residents on the block said Saturday they didn't really know the family in the brick bungalow that well , but they said police had been called to their home numerous times in the past, at least once to break up a dispute.

When diners open the ornate wood door, they enter a time warp. Every surface is filled with cut glass bowls and bric-a-brac. Crystal chandeliers sparkle, and windows are covered with heavy drapes and swoop valances.
Otilio Osorio was sentenced Monday to seven years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and other charges relating to a gun-running network. His brother, Ranferi Osorio, received a 10-year prison term for running the network.
The increase is "a bit bizarre given that all the other measures of confidence have recently fallen," said Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist with Capital Economics. Last week a Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey that also tracks consumer confidence showed the measure fell in July to its lowest level in more than two years.
Similar to some of the video footage from Japan, the wall of water wasn't huge. Cantwell said each of the three waves was about 3 feet high.

Google, which generated roughly $38 billion in revenue in 2011, does not break out financial results for YouTube. Analyst estimates for YouTube's revenue this year generally range between $2 billion and $3 billion.
Mr. Obama, by contrast, instead of using the elimination of bin Laden to proclaim a new American leadership in world affairs, thereafter elected to play a subordinate role in the successful campaign led by the British and French to depose Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Doing so put the United States back on course as a partner in multilateral responses to threats to peace in select corners of the globe, rather than continuing to play the world's policeman.

Q. Was there any hesitation by you when someone thought it would be a great idea to promote this movie by putting you in the position of possibly making a fool of yourself in front of country elite and a national television audience?
Nevertheless, it's hard to see the Baltimore Grand Prix, on balance, as anything short of a nice coup for the city, not only as an economic development boost but perhaps a psychological one as well. Racing fans saw Charm City as something other than a homicide capital, both fictional and real, and a lot of local residents probably woke up feeling better about Baltimore (call it pride if you will) and themselves than they did just a few days ago.

More and more, Dina Manzo is appearing to be the voice of reason. First, she decides to limit her teenage daughter's presence on the show. Now, she takes Bravo, Danielle and her own family to task for even allowing this fiasco to proceed: "All I have to say is that I am APPALLED at all involved who made a mockery of this event and childhood cancer. This is NOT the place for all this drama. I take this VERY seriously as these are the very babies that I work day in and day out for and I could NOT be more upset over this whole situation. I made it VERY, VERY clear to EVERYONE (even my own family) that me AND my husband were TOTALLY and COMPLETELY against this event being filmed, knowing how Danielle works NOTHING good could have come out of this. This was NOT the arena for drama." To which we say, Bravo.

“Yeah, it bothers me. But there’s nothing that can really be done about it,” a Cohansey Street resident of five years said early Wednesday morning.
Jimmy and Angie have an unusually frank discussion about love and life, at the end of which he admits his mother’s influence over him. It puts him in a funk that even Nucky’s startling retirement announcement doesn’t lift. Jimmy knows Nucky has something up his sleeve, and if he didn’t know, a drunken Eli is there to remind him. Jimmy’s got a conscience, a bad quality in a criminal, and he knows it. So does his momma.
The FBI arrested Baxter and four others Monday evening, saying they had planted what were believed to be explosive devices under the Ohio 82 bridge over Cuyahoga Valley National Park as part of a May Day protest today.
"The argument we make is banks need to be treating these properties the same, no matter where they are," Swesnik said. "We're not expecting them to do major overhauls of properties – they need to at least look like local properties around them. A lot of this is mowing the lawn, picking up trash. If you leave the lawn alone for three months, the grass is going to grow."
On Monday they responded with calm when the game got increasingly physical, and they kept their cool when they lost their lead early in the fourth, and they shined in overtime, especially Paul, who had eight points in overtime, making four of five shots.

øRounding out the top five, Alex Pietrangelo deserved a place, but Nicklas Lidstrom has to be in the top five. He's still the best one-on-one defenseman in the game. Still has the shot. And what a passer. I also wanted to find room for Suter who often gets overlooked. In the end, Pietrangelo didn't make my list, even though he had a "top five season."
More seriously, in a letter written April 9, after the mid-March rejection of the Eszterhas’ first draft of “The Maccabees,” the “Basic Instinct” writer had accused Gibson of making anti-Semitic remarks of all shapes and sizes, plus raging against ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva.
This is in response to the letter writer of "Freedom to phone" (Voice of the People, March 31), who thinks Americans need less government and should be allowed to talk on the phone while driving. I ask: What about the rest of us who are driving and walking while this person is on the phone? Watch out, I guess.

Bruininks began the leave July 1. In a surprise announcement last week, he became interim president of the Bush Foundation -- a post that could last until he returns to the U this fall as a fully tenured professor. The foundation said it would pay the university for about six months of Bruininks' leave.
"You can get it at Amazon for $2.10 per box, although you do have to purchase 10 at a time," Camille says. "If you spend $25, Amazon will ship for free, which is cheaper than driving to the local market."
I pretty well fit the external mold of this mysterious new ilk of "young evangelicals." I wear skinny jeans when I preach in a service that seems to some like a rock show. I sometimes work very hard at making my messy hairdo look like I did absolutely nothing to it, and a lot of folks think I don't care about the "gospel" because I also care about fatherless children in our inner cities and poor babies with bloated bellies in Africa and the abuse of women through sex slavery around the world. Neither the right-wingers nor the left-wingers quite know what to do with evangelicals like me.
An arraignment was set for April 3.

He began his testimony by insisting that he had no idea how widespread phone hacking was at the News of the World. He said he had been assured by subordinates that the practice was confined to a "rogue reporter" who was jailed in 2007 for tapping into voicemails left for members of Britain's royal household.
A provision contained in a House-passed bill doesn't specifically carve out monetary policy from congressional audits as current law does. However, the House bill says the audits shouldn't interfere or dictate the setting of interest rates. A Senate-passed bill, on the other hand, provides for a one-time audit of the Fed's emergency lending program. Congress must reconcile the two bills before a final vote is taken.
CDO took a 3-1 lead in the bottom half of the frame inning because of a throwing error that scored two. Noland then hit a solo home run in the second to give Canyon del Oro a 4-1 lead.
"He went to kindergarten and his teacher said, 'Wow. Did you know he could do three-point perspective?'" Dale Waters said.

North Korea's devices are likely along the lines of the first plutonium bomb the U.S. built — Fat Man, which was dropped on Nagasaki in 1945. That bomb was 3 meters (10 feet) long and weighed more than 4.5 tons.
The Hearst Building burned, too. So did The Chronicle, across the street at Geary, Kearny and Market, and the famous Palace Hotel, which had 800 rooms. The Palace also had more than 600,000 gallons of its own water and miles of hose, but the water ran out.

Then came the explosion after 2000 in subprime loans by unregulated mortgage companies. These were high-cost loans with inadequate underwriting to borrowers with poorer credit histories. By 2005-06, subprime mortgages were nearly half of all loans made to home buyers. The vast majority of these loans were to higher income -- not low- to moderate-income -- borrowers.

We’re certainly not saying the state was perfect in this case. There were some significant gaffes.
Cities across the region are trying to reverse the tide, buying and either rehabilitating or bulldozing empty homes. Even with billions of federal dollars pouring into cities, civic leaders such as Steve Leeper, director of a Cincinnati development group, say fixing lead paint, asbestos, decay and other problems takes a long time.

Though bin Laden's second-in-command and successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, has managed to elude the drones hunting him, the relentless attacks have forced al-Qaida's remaining senior officials in Pakistan to spend so much time in hiding that they may be increasingly out of touch with the movement they purport to lead. Meanwhile, the group's willingness to kill fellow Muslims in the name of global jihad has tarnished the al-Qaida brand in the Islamic world, even as democratic revolutions in the Mideast offer a political alternative to terrorist violence.
Mourdock's backers, meanwhile, have stepped up their criticism, casting Lugar, 80, as too moderate for the Republican-leaning state and out of touch after 36 years in Washington. Total ad spending intended to benefit Mourdock was pushing toward $2.3 million and could top that in the final week.
The father of the children, an off-duty Apache Junction police officer, was apparently at home during the shooting, according to Gilbert police Lt. John Lyle.
The cartel's leadership is said to have passed to Sanchez Arellano, the son of an Arellano Felix sister. Not much is known about Sanchez Arellano and it's unclear whether Mexican authorities even know what he looks like. They have not released a photo, as they commonly do for drug suspects.
Benicia Mayor Elizabeth Patterson, Solano County officials, plant workers and Coda executives applauded as the first sedan slowly rolled out of the plant and before a bank of cameras at a press event Monday.
ASSIST FIRE DEPARTMENT, SOUTH STREET: A resident reported late April 16 her TV was smoking, but she did not see any fire. The call was turned over to firefighters, who determined there was no immediate hazard.

Earth Day: A 44-year-old Indianapolis woman was seen punching a 23-year-old woman in the face on Earth Day. The older woman saw the woman toss a piece of paper on the ground and stopped her SUV. She told police she "does not take littering lightly."
"The Mavericks and I have mutually agreed that it's in the best interest of both parties for me to step away from the team," Odom said in a statement to ESPN.com. "I'm sorry that things didn't work out better for both of us, but I wish the Mavs' organization, my teammates and Dallas fans nothing but continued success in the defense of their championship."
Producer Gaby Tana says that part of Fiennes' tireless dedication to the project was rooted in his conviction that "Coriolanus" might be a play better served by the screen than the stage, where the character's anger and stubbornness are less easily mitigated. But the actor-director's conviction that "Coriolanus" is "a play about now" is underlined from the movie's opening shots of bombed-out buildings and troops in battle fatigues, not to mention the running narration delivered via flat-screen TV by British news anchor Jon Snow.
Worst travel-oriented television show: "Pan Am." Trying to slipstream the 1960s cool of "Mad Men," ABC launched a television series this fall centering around the adventures of young pilots and "stewardesses" flying for the late, lamented airline of the title, circa 1963. It had the look down pat, and the computer-generated imaging of Boeing 707s flying out of the old Worldport terminal at what would become John F. Kennedy International Airport were cool. Some of the episodes never became airborne because of often-leaden writing and often-wooden acting. The series is near the bottom of Sunday night ratings and flirting with cancellation, but will return for at least a few more flights Jan. 4.
Now, Romney could pull off his own trifecta, and deprive Santorum of the oxygen he needs to sustain his campaign through another three-week gap that leads to primaries in his home state of Pennsylvania as well as Connecticut, Delaware and New York -- all friendly terrain for Romney.

"I think it's fine in the hands of first responders—police, fire and paramedics," Brandolini said. "Personally, I have reservations about giving it to the addicts themselves. I think it may give them a false sense of security."
Key's Meyer said the pool of consumers and businesses regarded as good customers simply has shrunk. Many of the good customers don't want to borrow as much, and the banks don't want to lend to the riskier customers who could have easily qualified for loans three years ago.

From 2002 through 2006, 20 states and the District of Columbia revoked or suspended No. 222117's medical licenses. Two professional societies took away the doctor's memberships. The Department of Health and Human Services banned the doctor from billing Medicare and Medicaid. And the Drug Enforcement Administration revoked the doctor's permit to prescribe controlled drugs. For most of these years, the doctor's home base was Missouri.
In some disasters, authorities have rushed to dispose of bodies—sometimes in mass graves the size of football fields—citing fears that the corpses could spread disease or damage the psyche of survivors if left visible. But there is little risk of epidemics spread by corpses after disasters, global health officials say, in part because pathogens don't survive long in dead bodies.
Miller was not alone in speaking for the merger. "Anything that increases the likelihood, feasibility and the reality of interdisciplinary studies is good," said Leo S. MacKay Jr., a Lockheed Martin executive who chairs the board of visitors for the School of Public Policy in College Park.
"In Loki's entrance scene, where I pop into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s lab and face Sam Jackson and Stellan Skarsgard, I was lit from underneath, kneeling on one-knee on this grill," Hiddleston says. "Being a huge U-2 fan, I remembered that same shot from their rock documentary, 'Rattle and Hum.' I think the performance of 'With or Without You' that they used in the film was from Sun Valley Stadium in Arizona (and) inspired that scene. I got so chilled I had to tell Joss, 'You DO realize that in this scene, I look EXACTLY like (U-2 singer) Bono in that film. Leather trousers, long black hair, lit from below. All that's missing is the microphone, and (guitarist) the Edge, rocking out on the guitar to my right."

Until now, @LindenLeaks had been an obscure Twitter account with not much to say. It debuted in January 2011, with its owner offering just a couple of dozen observations during its first year of existence.

To compensate for drastic reductions in allowable harvest, the 1994 Northwest Forest Plan provided for "transition payments." But because most counties had few realistic economic alternatives to transition to, Congress enacted a stopgap, the ironically titled Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act (SRS), on which counties like Curry have since been dependent. With the expiration of SRS payments last year and PILT payments this year, Western delegations in Congress have been scrambling for extensions.
