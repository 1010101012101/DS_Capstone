Dear Ben: There is great feedback here, but you will need to take the initiative. You want your daughter to be competent in the world and have options. It’s as silly to not teach your kid how to drive as it is to not teach them how to swim. Push kindly — but firmly. Make it a fact-of-life requirement.

In the middle of class, we were called to the gym and made to wait for fifteen minutes to find out what was going to happen. This would not have been as surprising if we had some kind of warning.

We support each other in everything. We are always there for one another. This news has hurt us, but we are not broken. We refuse to go down without a fight. We love our school, and we don't want to go anywhere else. This school is our home. We love this school and will do anything it takes to reverse this decision."

"It's expanded quite a bit," said Rutherford, who hopes to write a book about his adventure. "When I left, there was one person on the dock. It kind of snowballed. You get to the Arctic and it picks up a little pace. You get around Cape Horn and it picks up. A snowflake becomes an avalanche."
"This year it may be a Catholic against whom the finger of suspicion is pointed; in other years it has been -- and may someday be again -- a Jew, or a Quaker, or a Unitarian, or a Baptist. It was Virginia's harassment of Baptist preachers, for example, that led to Jefferson's statute of religious freedom. Today, I may be the victim, but tomorrow it may be you, until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped apart at a time of great national peril."

Yet, nothing would help the Hilltop Margarita, which tasted more like a watered-down screwdriver with tequila. After tasting the Negroni ($7), which was overpowered by Campari, it became apparent that it might be best to stick with wine.

It is the newspaper's opinion that New Jersey laws on unused sick pay, and to some extent accrued leave time, are out of control.

The Von Bondies last released an album five years ago, around the time that this decade's garage-rock revival was petering out. What then to make of "Love Hate and Then There's You," which mainly flogs the same formula as its predecessor? Once more we find singer/guitarist Jason Stollsteimer pushing catchy anguish and drummer Don Blum pounding his way to rapture. The riffs are tight, but not so fresh. When they don't evoke vintage Von Bondies, they suggest the Killers or, in the case of a dramatic lead single, "Pale Bride," the British band Bloc Party.

But I surely left the candles smoldering, their wax, still-malleable globs sinking down in the frosting as though trapped in cream-cheese quicksand as I sped out the door at the stroke of age 16, heading to the Sunnyvale DMV with my mom in tow.

Today, the biggest challenge we must meet is the one we present to ourselves. To not become a nation that places entitlement ahead of accomplishment.

We are a better people than that; and we must demand a better nation than that.”

The Regal Turbo gets regular, Touring and Sport settings. In the Regal GS, GS mode reduces power-steering assist and stiffens the suspension, but the differences in ride comfort are slim. GS mode improves steering feedback at higher speeds, but no matter the setting the wheel still turns with light effort around town. That's something I prefer, though driving enthusiasts may want higher-effort steering.

Bill Wurtzel is a New York art director and jazz musician who has spent the past 50 years making hilarious breakfast tableaus for his wife: A bowl of oatmeal turns into a grumpy, balding man with the judicious application of banana slices, raisins and pecans.

Hey, Ronnie: Foles is gaining traction with fans and draftniks as a viable option. He has great size (6-5 and 240 pounds), good arm strength and decent accuracy. But there are reasons he isn't mentioned as a first-round talent. With him, the negatives are a 15-18 career record, 33 career interceptions and most of his college experience in a shotgun offense. But his size alone should merit him a long look, in my opinion.

Given demographic trends in the developing world, the transatlantic divide in immigrant experiences is bound to grow. Fertility rates in Mexico, which a generation ago ran more than twice the level in the United States, now equal those on this side of the border. History shows that slowdowns in fertility precede slowdowns in emigration. Africa, a vastly more important source of migrants in Europe than in North America for simple reasons of geography, will be the last continent to witness the great decline in fertility rates historically associated with economic development.

But it's a slight piece, a pale shadow of the hilarity-with-teeth of Epp and Dominique Serrand's Theatre de la Jeune Lune version of Molière's "The Miser" at the Rep six years ago.

It's kind of my own thing, but I do look at things like the blogs for new ideas and inspiration. I'm told I should be working in fashion. I just helped my sister plan her wedding; I'm good at it.

The philosophy behind why Grayson — or any Democrat — would want a Tea Partyer in their race is that, when both a GOP and Tea Party candidate are in a race, the two candidates split the conservative vote, giving the Dem an edge.
Curiously, I know a family that got such an experience up close and personal, finding themselves, as Eastern European farmers, sometime around 1947 being forcibly incorporated into the newly created Soviet “Hungarian People’s Republic.” Be aware the Soviet-style “Republic” has no equal to the American version of “Republic,” for in any Soviet “Republic” the political power was held by the Communist rulers over the common citizen, whereas in America under the Constitution today, (and hopefully ongoing) the political power is held by the people, and wielded by them through their elected representatives and senators.

There's a tendency to judge one period of time as preferable to another. I think it works more this way: Changing part of any system sends ripples through that system. B.C.

One reason Batum felt comfortable going to the glass Saturday was that coach Nate McMillan had him and Gerald Wallace cross-match positions defensively, with Wallace guarding Hawks guard Joe Johnson, leaving Batum on small forward Marvin Williams.

Let us review the facts. First, the insurance broker involved had the school district contract since 2006, two years before Mayor Bencivengo’s administration took office. Second, the woman who cooperated with the FBI was a close personal friend of the mayor and he would have tried to help her regardless of any benefit to himself. Third, why was she wearing the wire? This raises the question in my mind of what she might have done that she would agree to record Mr. Bencivengo for the FBI. Fourth, there is absolutely no indication that anyone else in local government had any connection whatsoever to this alleged incident.

The film, which follows the 2002 Oakland Athletics and GM Billy Beane's expanded use of statistics, is up for the Academy Awards' best picture Sunday. Mabry, who is played by David Hutchinson in the movie, said that the team wasn't "test-tube babies" for the statistical revolution as portrayed by Hollywood and that any retelling falls short when it minimizes the role of the team's top three pitchers, Tim Hudson, Barry Zito and Mark Mulder.

• Huskies ready to face Pac-12's new foes -- Percy Allen, Seattle Times: It's no secret football drove Scott's decision to expand the conference for the first time in three decades, but the league's 0-12 showing against ranked basketball teams magnifies the curious choice to extend invitations to schools that have been weak on the hard court recently. But it's not as if Colorado is embarrassing the Pac-12 this season. The Buffaloes are 9-4 and 1-0 in conference. Still, a closer examination of their record reveals CU has benefited from a soft schedule that ranks 243rd among the 345 Division I teams, according to the Pomeroy ratings.

In a letter to MALDEF Thursday, assistant city attorney David Broadwell pointed out that the Supreme Court "has established several preconditions for proving a 'vote dilution' claim," none of which appears remotely on point in Denver.
