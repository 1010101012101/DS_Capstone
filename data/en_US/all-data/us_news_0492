“Gov. Deal has reduced the size of government, reduced the number of state employees, implemented zero-based budgeting -- and used those savings to give Georgians a tax cut,” Robinson said. “That’s what he ran on and that’s what he’s done. Promises kept.”
But it's high school taken to a fictive plane, a realm that incorporates video games, reality TV, futuro-retro fashions, and Truman Show-esque, God-is-in-the-control-booth themes of manipulation and oppression. And while The Hunger Games has its share of fantasy elements, they are modest by comparison to the epic sorcery of the Harry Potters, or the vampire shtick of the Twilight Saga.

It is far from clear that the creditors' maneuver will work, legal experts say. But defendants warn that if Aurelius and its allies prevail, markets that depend on the sanctity of a settled transaction could be disrupted by making it difficult for investors to assess the risk inherent in participating in an LBO. It also would call into question a traditional assumption of Chapter 11 reorganization: that bankruptcy court is a place where all constituents of an insolvent company come together to resolve their differences in a single courtroom.

California's dependence on income taxes has also grown because of its shifting economy. Income taxes now account for more than half of its general revenue, up from about a third in 1981. Because the state's sales and use tax applies mainly to goods, rather than faster-growing services, it has declined in importance. The state's corporate tax has also shrunk relative to income taxes because of tax credits and other changes.

--- Getting a lot of questions from Ducks fans about Oregon's thin 2012 football non-conference schedule. It includes non-conference games vs. Arkansas State, Fresno State and Tennessee Tech. Ugh. Those games are locked in, yes. Meanwhile Oregon State is playing BYU on the road and Nicholls State and Wisconsin at home in non-conference games. Begin the discussion now about how happy you are that the Pac-12 will be playing future non-conference games against the Big 10.

Murphy also botched a pair of double plays. Which leads to questions about where he would play if Wright lands on the disabled list. Justin Turner and Ronny Cedeno (who smacked three hits in his first start of the year) are both options to split time at the hot corner. Collins could also shift Murphy to third. A call-up for a minor-leaguer like Zach Lutz or Jordany Valdespin also fits the realm of possibilities.

Over time, those rough mining towns became family-oriented cities. As the mining industry grew in stature, so did its political muscle.

In the history of professional sports, Im not sure theres ever been a more disliked figure than NHL commissioner Gary Bettman. It doesnt help that he looks and talks like a weasel. It doesnt help that he has all the arrogance and smugness of NBA commissioner David Stern even though hes made his game worse during his near two decades of power. And it doesnt help that we live in Detroit and have been the victims of nearly every one of his silly decisions that supposedly make the sport better, but make things worse for Red Wing Nation.
"The difference in the series was our power play," Hitchcock said. "We earned the penalties based on our work, then I thought the way we went about business on the power play was excellent.

Antoine McClain, Clemson, OG: McClain was a three-year started and saw action in 54 games during his college career, but that experience and his size (6-foot-5, 330 pounds) wasn’t enough for him to get drafted.

That's a big difference, but one that doesn't necessarily translate into student performance, experts say. Indeed, at a time when urban and suburban districts across the U.S. are lengthening their school days in an effort to improve tests scores and student learning, no studies conclusively link more instruction time with higher achievement.

Versari said she was surprised to hear of Seau's suicide because he seemed to have a full post-NFL life with a business, charity work and social network.
Let me just describe why I think that is important. Let's say we have another major industry that gets into trouble. Will they be able to get financing? Will lenders be able to loan to them to try to help them turn around? Lenders will say, holy cow, if the president steps in we're gonna get wiped out. We won't have the rights which exist under the law as secured creditors. So they will refuse to loan. So businesses will start going bankrupt because they can't get financing, because they're fearful of a government that will step in and violate the law.
It sort of reminds us of those performance reviews you get from the boss, where everything sounds dandy until he or she gets to the part about the raise.

The more you order, the less control you have over the organization of your meal. But that hardly matters. Unlike with Western dinners, there's no standard sequence of appetizer, entree and dessert. If you have the fiery fish soup, a devil's caldron of cayenne- and paprika-flavored broth chunked with delectable black cod that goes down with the smoothness of silk, it may arrive in the middle of everything. If Westerners begin a meal with soup and Chinese end a banquet with it, Koreans put it anywhere. Here's an ideal free-form meal at Du Kuh Bee: pan-fried squid and cabbage, handmade dumplings, bok choy, jellyfish salad, barbecued beef and pork noodles. How you get from one dish to the next is not important, and in no time your table will be piled with platters.

Visitors to Ventura County to spend Mother's Day weekend with my brother and his family, we saw a bright green sign on Saturday morning. A bright red strawberry was painted in the center, but the written message was too far away to be read. Heading in the opposite direction was a bad decision.

They possibly rode the short distance on the truck where they were being sold.

A consortium could mean "impeding client access, loss of community income, and loss of a dozen or more living wage jobs to HAP (Housing Authority of Portland), especially on an accelerated time-frame that appears like an end run of the RAB meeting."

If they aren't, they should be. The Bears might need help on their interior offensive line more than they need help at the tackle position. Within two years, they might need three new starters at left guard, right guard and center. Pouncey could start out this year as the left guard, and then move inside to center when Kreutz moves on (assuming Kreutz is re-signed). The problem is Pouncey probably won't be on the board when the Bears pick at No. 29. Trading up is a possibility, but it would come with drawbacks. The Bears have had a deficit of high draft picks over the last two years because of trades. Giving away two high draft picks for one good prospect in this scenario might not make good sense.

Sam Littman, NBADraft.net: "The most aggravating and disappointing aspect of the draft is the number of highly skilled and determined players who are passed up because they’re too short by NBA standards. Morehead State’s Kenneth Faried is the very player that would usually undeservedly fall to the second round, but the numbers he posted in college are too incredible to ignore. Still, the question remains, does he have what it takes to be the next Dennis Rodman? Or even the next DeJuan Blair? Or is he the next Luc Richard Mbah a Moute? ESPN’s Fran Fraschilla boldly claimed that if Faried was 6-9, he would be the top pick in the draft."

But never so much that it devastates the ritual as a whole. That would be too much to bear.

Of course, clothing reconstruction has been going on since the early days of punk, when safety pins were all the rage. But it wasn't until the turn of the millennium that it spread from the punk scene into the world of big-city hipsters. Brody, who lived in San Francisco for eight years, says she first saw the look on Bay Area streets around 2001. And the normal progression followed. It hit stylish boutiques by 2002, and then the big chains in 2003-2004.

The fact is that the Bears' let's-get-serious schedule begins Saturday, at Washington. The Candlestick opener was deemed a "neutral site," featuring a slight majority of fans from Fresno State. Cal played a nonconference game at Colorado, even though the Buffaloes are in the Pac-12. And nobody could fathom the scheduling of Presbyterian, a liberal-arts school from Clinton, S.C., with a student body of about 1,200. That amounts to three weeks of complete befuddlement.

• Football recruiting an indicator of future, reminder of past -- Kyle Ringo, Daily Camera: The class Jon Embree has assembled and is putting the finishing touches on in these final few days, appears to be pretty good. No, it's not in the top 10 or even the top 25 in rankings from Scout.com and Rivals.com, but as of Sunday evening, it was rated No. 29 by Scout and No. 31 by Rivals. That's not bad considering the Buffs haven't been in the top-25 polls during the season since 2005.

CHICAGO - Jurors shrugged off Jennifer Hudson's star status and insisted it played no role in their decision to convict her former brother-in-law for slaying the Oscar winner's mother, brother and nephew — a verdict that means the 31-year-old Chicago man will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars.
The role of tiebreaker is not new for Rosenthal. Twice before, in 1992 and 2001, he served on the state’s other redistricting commission, which redraws U.S. House district boundaries. In 2001, the House members of both parties agreed among themselves on a map that protected incumbents.

If the Cardinals and Wainwright reach October, that is when he'll be 19 months removed from surgery. Wainwright's early success in spring skewed expectations. But his final few starts of spring and his first three starts of the regular season show there's a reason why managers, teammates, and peers said it could take a year for Wainwright to feel right. Because it probably will. That's the timetable.

The Congressional Budget Office will report Obama's health care price controls -- payment cuts to doctors and hospitals in Medicare and other programs -- as large, long-term budget savings. The CBO is the most lenient sort of referee, giving credit for a proposed play instead of an actual score. But such reductions are not likely to happen. Every year Congress passes a "doc fix" to avert much smaller cuts. Obama's health care law already pushes Medicare disbursement rates below Medicaid rates -- a level that currently makes it difficult for Medicaid patients to find doctors willing to treat them. The Medicare actuary predicts that cuts already passed by Congress will cause about 15 percent of providers to become unprofitable. Proposing even more drastic reductions is more of a ploy than a plan. But it would look good on paper.
“I want our guys to be proud of what they did, because they worked hard and played well together and made tremendous progress … but we had a couple games we were really disappointed in because we didn’t max out on those little things and it cost us a ball game.

It's charming and boasts a sandy beach inside a cave, yet it cannot hold a candle to the sheer grandeur of Thien Duong.

Gary Claxton, a vice president at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health insurance issues nationally, puts the figure even lower. He says that for many health plans already in existence, "1½ percent might be a stretch." But "it depends on how chintzy the plans are," he added, because some that would only cover annual medical costs up to $2,000 or $3,000 -- an example from the fast food industry -- will have to beef up their coverage under the law, and that will mean higher premiums.

With one out and runners at the corners, he dived to stop a grounder by David Ortiz up the middle and flipped to the second baseman Plouffe from his stomach with one hand. Then Plouffe whirled around for a perfect relay throw to finish the double play.
Both men have extensive criminal records and are expected to face a variety of charges once the five law-enforcement agencies involved in their apprehension sort out their reported crimes from the time of the fatal shooting to the end of the gunbattle.

"It's demoralizing. It takes the enthusiasm out of the classroom," sociology professor Caleb Southworth said. "You've eliminated the possibility of the professor doing a good job in that environment. And for the students, you're not going to have a good course."
Márquez signed a 3½-year deal with the Red Bulls in the summer of '10 and has been a significant distraction since. His uneven play has frustrated fans, and last year the Mexican national team captain, who makes $4.6 million per season, was suspended for one game by the club for publicly criticizing his teammates.
Instead of fresh-cut flowers, many brides like Vivrette are making or buying alternatives out of fabric, paper and even old brooches. The results can be stunning -- colorful paper hydrangeas, sparkling brooches, even quirky buttons, hundreds of them, forming a bouquet.
Salazar has only nine goals this season — he produced 15 as a freshman and 17 as a junior — but "his game has really improved this year in many areas," Gwozdecky said. "He hasn't scored as many goals as maybe many people expected, but he's really become a better player, a more well-rounded, multidimensional player for us."
McCafferty, who lost a re-election bid, did not testify during the trial. But her lawyer argued that the judge did not knowingly lie to FBI agents in 2008, when they questioned the judge about discussions she had with people who had cases pending in her court.

Very much like a scene from an old postcard. A sense of community was a big factor in my upbringing. Kelly's Candy Store was a must-stop after school.
The Blazers are embarking on a newly dedicated rebuilding phase that figures to include liberal playing time for anyone who shows they will play hard, and their positions – point guard and center – are the two most glaring needs of the Blazers moving forward. Both will be available to play Tuesday night against Milwaukee at the Rose Garden, Flynn wearing No. 3 and Thabeet No. 34.
Legal experts said Monday it is possible Murdoch's U.S. companies even may face legal actions because of the shady practices at the News of the World, his now defunct British tabloid.
I also couldn't complain about the portion size of the excellent arctic char ($22) with a dollop of orange hollandaise on top and a bed of sugar snap peas, sliced potatoes and a swirl of flavored oils underneath, or the halibut ($24) capped with tomato confit and enhanced with spring onions, favas and basil sauce.

The running sketch which gives the episode its name focuses on two upwardly striving parents (Fred and Carrie) determined to get their son, Grover, into a high-status preschool.
PHOENIX, Ariz -- If Browns quarterback Seneca Wallace lights it up today in Arizona in this West Coast offense that he knows so well, what will it mean for Colt McCoy, who's home with a concussion? The end of his season? The end of his starting job with the Browns?
The Constitution gives the president absolute discretion in granting clemency, but misuse of the power can taint his or her legacy. Ask Clinton. The former president will never live down his indefensible, last-minute pardon of fugitive financier whose former wife contributed generously to Clinton's presidential library.
The Question: I just used Turbo Tax, which I bought for $49.95, and it took me about 4 hours to fill in the detail and just when I was going to send everything, Turbo Tax said I had to pay $29.95 to send it by e-mail through their bank University National Bank of Saint Paul, MN. I am angry because there was nothing on the package or in the software that said that there would be an extra fee.

“He told me it was now squared away and that I was approved for the modification,” Conca said. Approved not just for a trial payment plan, but approved for an actual modification. The supervisor said Conca would receive information in the mail about his new modified payment in about 10 days, Conca said. About a month went by, and Conca said he didn’t receive any information from the bank. Finally, on April 10, a letter. But not the one he was expecting. “According to our records, payment for your home loan is past due,” it said. Conca finally called a lawyer for help, and the lawyer corresponded with the lender, but got nowhere.
When asked twice whether any players actually were paid for hits, White confirmed they were without going into specifics. She added that most of the money in the bounty scheme was provided by the players.
When did “skill” become a pejorative as applied to the playoffs?
I saw it all go down, Rodriguez said. Its hard even to talk about it tonight. I mean, Mo has meant so much to us on a personal level, and his significance on the field, on the mound. But the bottom line is were the New York Yankees, and nobody is going to feel sorry for us.
a 14-year stint on the St. Charles City Council.
Coming from a stage background, all of a sudden lines are changing, he said. And not having been in the creative process of a new play where that might happen, I'm thinking: Whoa, if you don't get your joke right away they'll take it away or change it.' Sometimes you have to fight for the joke and sometimes you have to pick your battles. It took me a while to learn how to articulate what I needed.
Kamloops finished the game on the power play, including 27 seconds of 5-on-3. The Blazers pulled Cheveldave for an extra attacker with 50 seconds left, but surrendered the empty-net goal to Ross before the could generate a serious scoring threat.
That drew a sharp rebuke from O’Neal, who said there was no deal made with the Senate.
Brammertz said he was critical of self-defense cases because international war crimes law was complex and difficult even for trained lawyers. "I'm not always sure this is in the interest of justice" to have an inexperienced person in charge of the defense.
At least four of the six suicides in 2010 involved middle-aged to elderly men. Most appeared to wrestle with depression. None were terminally ill. Authorities did not provide details on the other two deaths.
Opening the season of Chicago's internationally acclaimed contemporary dance company will be the previously announced full-evening commission by resident choreographer Alejandro Cerrudo.

They settled on a three-part plan: their aid would be targeted to school districts that either don't have after school athletics, or are facing cuts to existing programs. It would come in three forms (1) financial (2) equipment and supplies and (3) volunteers.
Some board members rejected an early version of the resolution introduced by member C. Todd Jones that included references to legislation introduced last week in the General Assembly that would enable Jackson to carry out his plan. They thought it amounted to endorsement of the plan.
But the past three months of controversy has done a lot of damage, according to companies and business groups. It may be hard to sort out though, because the economy has been weak anyway. Economic-development officials say the immigration controversy has been detracting from the serious work needed to help the economy and create jobs. Although polls show support for Arizona's law and much of it has been put on hold, boycotters aren't backing down.
The 10 percent cap did not mollify Republican state senators, who demanded evidence that the trustees can make the tough decisions needed to control costs. In February, Republicans refused to provide the votes needed to reconfirm Board of Trustees Chairman Herb Carter. Apparently, the trustees got the message. The proposed presidents' salary freeze would not prevent campus foundations from contributing to a president's pay package, as happened with Hirshman. At least taxpayer dollars will not go toward executive pay raises when it is needed to pay for professors and janitors.
It was as a result of the building’s worst disaster that it acquired its familiar name. Gutted by fire in 1814 after the British torched it in wartime, the house was rebuilt under James Madison. To conceal scorch marks on the exterior stone, he had it whitewashed. It became the "White House," in popular reference, but it wasn’t until 1902 that the title was formally adopted, replacing Executive Mansion.
The videos show the 7-year-old singing at a school performance and giving a report on bridges.
I have to admit: I was hoping for VAN HALEN-CON 2012. Sort of like Burning Man, but with a greater possibility of being set on fire by an errant can of Aqua Net or hassled in the parking lot by some toughs in Thom McAns. You know, a real circus. I wanted to fear for my life.

"The ball joint doesn't fit into the socket so it doesn't rotate smoothly," Reutter said. "It's tearing the labrum and the ligaments, and in the left hip I have a labral tear. They will have to shave the bone down. It's happened slowly over time and I think this is causing a back injury that isn't getting any better."
Virgin Galactic spokeswoman Jackie McQuillan promised a "theatrical unveil" followed by a cocktail party for paying passengers and other VIPs.
"That's not realistic -- not likely to happen even if everything goes as well as planned," says Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington think tank. The $50 billion is a "placeholder," a number neither the Defense Department nor outsiders can estimate given the uncertainties of war and political stabilization.
Imagine knowing that your life is in the hands of your 8-year-old, and whether he could get someone to come to your aid quickly enough. Do you think your child could do it? I'm not sure that my 7-year-old daughter could keep herself together and pull that off, but I'd like to think she could put aside her fear and do it.
"It would be nice if I was sitting here talking about a contract, but we'll put that on the back-burner," Josh said before concluding his 12-minute admittance fest.
But there is no reason the federal government has to keep spending 24 percent of GDP. The historical postwar average is just over 20 percent – and those budgets sustained a robust manned space program.

The first DVD is devoted to the 88-minute making-of documentary; the second has a 2009 performance of the “Darkness” songs by Springsteen and the E Street Band at an audience-free Paramount Theatre in Asbury Park, as well as vintage live and studio footage. The third captures the full majesty of the “Darkness”-era E Street Band, live, with a 1978 Houston concert in its nearly three-hour entirety.
Neruda's house in Valparaíso is high on a hill with expansive windows facing the Pacific. I decided to hoof it up the steep incline rather than take one of the tiny buses that wind their way up — a mistake. I should have shelled out the $1.50 or so to take the bus, and ended up doing so for the ride back down.
The vandals smashed windows and threw paint at the police station and damaged the property of businesses and vehicles, police said.

"Bernard kind of knows where we stand on that issue," Frazier said.
Hungry Cat's decor signals serious restaurant too. No fishnets tacked to the walls or kitschy buoys. The look is breathtakingly simple. Wire baskets are filled with oyster shells or, at the bar, lemons, limes, oranges and grapefruit. Walls are the gray of an overcast morning, and windows open onto a minimalist view of sea and sky. The original Hungry Cat could fit in a mere corner of this space, and yet because of the way the space is divided, this much larger restaurant manages to feel cozy enough.
A large picture window on the back of the house had landed on the deck, which was strewn with chairs, pieces of the fence and strips of twisted metal.
Then there's the matter of politics.
Also, continued Krolicki, "one of the unique aspects of our bid would be to highlight Lake Tahoe and the environmental stewardship we absolutely must pursue to protect this treasure. We think the Games could provide a clarity regarding environmental issues for decades to come."
Lawson, 28 at the time, was an unemployed trucker, a former Air Force mechanic and, by most accounts, a mellow, introverted soul. He was also the son of one of Douglas County's more legendary sex offenders.
This should be the time when our governor focuses all of his attention on solving the budget problem: identifying the issues correctly, finding ways past the obstacles and building the relationships he needs to reach a compromise.
That's what goalies can do, more than any other figure in sports. They are the priest in the confessional, the governor on the phone. With one flick of a glove, one flap of a pad, one well-placed movement, they can erase all sins and pardon all crimes.
Century jumped out to 17-5 lead, but Forest Grove closed the first quarter with three-pointers from Zac Collins and Michael Garcia to get within eight heading into the second quarter.
Luger told investors at a meeting last month that Beckman had hired a Swiss law firm to help find their money. He said Monday that he hopes to have some information for investors as soon as this week, but he declined to elaborate.
Mr. Hind invented well past the age of retirement. When his wife was diagnosed with shingles in 1989, he figured out a way to better deliver the painkiller lidocaine she was being given through injections. He made it into a gel, applied it to her back and wrapped her in plastic wrap. The patch, called Lidoderm, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1999.
In fact, it's getting tougher for any brewery to invade a distant market. Thanks to craft beer's rapid growth, virtually every region in the country already has its own breweries and favored local brews.
Business groups such as the California Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable have not yet said whether they will support Brown's new initiative. But they've indicated they might -- or at least stay on the sidelines -- if the Democratic-controlled Legislature comes through by rolling back pensions and jettisoning excessive regulations.

I went all the way to Tahiti just to see the famous Teahupoo break only to find out I had missed a big swell by two days. Closer to home, I've volunteered to cover contests at Trestles and Huntington Beach.
Pietrangelo was a Game 2 scratch but with a lower body injury rather than a concussion-related issue as had been feared after he crashed face-first into the boards near the end of the second period. He could return for Game 3.

Near the truck is the patio-style swing where Knight rested during the day and chatted with visitors. On the swing is an open Bible, pages flapping in the hot desert wind.
Although prolonged cold weather has been missing so far, winter days remain dark longer than we like and days for jogging in a T-shirt and shorts remain dreams. When a dark chill cools our bones and creates the winter blues, it's good to turn off the bad news and seek out better. When you feel grouchy, do it and move on. Instead of looking for someone to console us, it is worthwhile to help another person move ahead. Organizing with daily goals, lists and a simplified environment turns on the sunshine in our lives.
Firefighters and medical teams rushed to the area after the tornado struck Tsukuba city, 40 miles from Tokyo. The city is a science center, with dozens of research and academic institutes, but the tornado appeared to be mostly in residential areas.

Bennett threw two touchdown passes on Saturday against Colorado. I know. The Buffaloes are barely a Pacific-12 Conference team. But it was how easy he made it look, and how fluid and attacking he looked in the second half against a fast Arizona State defense that makes me think beyond 2011.
"We have created ... Cell-Self-Destructo," says the theater's owner, Gary Meyer, in a dramatic, am-I-scaring-you-yet? tone of voice. "See, if you use your cell phone during a film, your phone will self-destruct. It will explode in your hand."

This was a big deal because the victory over Texas marked the second victory this season over a Top 25 team and showed what this team is capable of when it gets its collective mind right. This was a big deal because it brings Missouri's season record to 5-5 with two very winnable games to go - against a Texas Tech team that just got blown away 66-6 by Oklahoma State, and the last-place Kansas Jayhawks who are 0-7 in the conference and 2-8 overall. That means MU has a chance to end the regular season by stringing together three consecutive victories, finish the regular season at 7-5 and cap off the year with a unique bowl trip experience to New York City (the Pinstripe Bowl).

WASHINGTON -- A New York City distributor has agreed to pay more than $500,000 to settle a complaint that it was slow in reporting a defect and fire hazard linked to oscillating fans.
The purpose of my response is to let you know that I am sorry for your loss, but to also let you know that I have seen many, many families in nearly the same situation in which you found yourself -- a loved one has made clear they want a natural death, no heroics and to be kept comfortable. But, when they see their loved one turning blue, or struggling to breathe, or in pain that is out of control, the family has no moral choice but to take their loved one to an acute care hospital. And that is where the problem lies -- going to the hospital.
