On a tour arranged by Noor, an official palace guide pointed out the décor's myriad male and female symbols; even the cages have male and female birds, a feature that prompted the guide to divulge an interesting theory about the present sultan, who has just one wife and five daughters, unlike his father, another Hamengkubuwono, who had 21 children with four concubines. The sultan's sad lack of a male heir, the guide suggested, stems from the sexual aggressiveness of the queen consort, a condition that produces girl children only.

The first thing is to prep the walls. All holes need to be filled, and any bumps need to be scraped off. When wallpaper dries, it clearly shows imperfections in the wall surface. You must paint the walls with a special wallpaper primer. These paints ensure that the adhesive does not penetrate deeply into the wall. Another advantage of using these special primers is they grant you extra work time. The primers leave a glossy sheen that allows the adhesive to stay in the liquid state for up to 15 minutes, allowing you plenty of time to wiggle each sheet of wallpaper into position.

Granted, their bill wouldn't reduce the amount flowing to the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare -- the point is just to make the numbers add up in the unified federal budget, where revenue into the trust fund counts against spending on other programs.

Or, a sound almost as annoying to vendors, the low-ball offer for top-grade equipment.
Her name is Beth, and she's played attractively by Taylor Schilling, who survived hard duty as the heroine of last year's ghastly "Atlas Shrugged." Beth resists Logan as long as she can—he tends to creep her out because he can't tell her why he's come—but things work out for them in a plot that resembles a game of checkers rather than chess. Blythe Danner graces her every scene as Beth's mother. Jay R. Ferguson is Beth's ex-husband, Keith, a heavy who redefines overwrought. The kennel's dogs are mostly playful, and the movie uses exactly the right amount of Spanish moss.

At the combine, Osweiler confidently said there hasn’t been a quarterback with his combination of size and athletic ability. And though he may be a little too confident about the athleticism, he is a very intriguing prospect and a potential steal. Watching highlights of Osweiler shows a quarterback that plays much smaller but still has the ability to see over almost anyone on the field. Potential drawbacks, though, will be his relative immaturity — another year at ASU would have been huge — and the fact that he was just a 45 percent passer in the red zone.

(On what his definition is when he said he wants to feel good about the football team)- "Well my own personal definition, wherever I was, is that you develop a football team who is a playoff-caliber team every year. You've got a shot to be in the playoffs every year. If you get into the playoffs you need a little luck, you need something going your way, you're quarterback has to be healthy. Then some other things happen, but to get into the tournament, to be there every year that is I think a realistic, healthy goal. To say, 'Okay we're going to win the Super Bowl every year.' Well, that'd be wonderful, but what's real. Give me a chance to compete for the Super Bowl and to do that you've got to get in the playoffs. This is Pat's first year. I really can't give you what the record is going to be at the end, but you keep building it. If we can reach those levels or the level I just described to you then I'd feel good and I think our fans should feel good about that."

She lived to the last day, and that’s great.” Gurley, who’d first met the stylish 95-year-old club-hopping Kaplan at Bungalow 8 a few years ago, called her an “inspiration,” saying, “That’s the way she would have wanted it. She wasn’t in a hospital, she wasn’t in a bathtub — she was at a fashion show. A beautiful demise. I bet she died with a smile.”

With the 2010 redistricting, 80 Assembly members each represent 465,674 people, a nearly impossible task; 40 Senate members each represent 931,349 people. The size of the Legislature hasn't changed since 1879, when the state had fewer than 1 million people.

"One Bright Shining Moment" is at its best reminding us what went right and what went wrong in the senator's 1972 campaign against Nixon.

How could you have avoided this? I would tell you to avoid code-sharing flights, but in this day and age of airline partnerships and alliances, it's practically impossible to do that.

The Hawks could have packed it in when Al Horford was lost in the season’s 11th game. They could have slid to the No. 7 or No. 8 seed _ although with Derrick Rose gone, being No. 8 doesn’t look so bad _ and been content just to make the playoffs. They finished with the East’s fourth-best record, which was better than they did last season with Horford, and they’ve hung (relatively) tough even after backup center Zaza Pachulia hurt his foot.

COLUMBUS, Ohio - Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland has picked Yvette McGee Brown, his running mate in his unsuccessful re-election bid, as the first African-American woman to become an Ohio Supreme Court justice.
She said that it was a 'horrible year.' She finally had to admit to herself that she couldn't do it. She looked at herself as a failure and felt that she had let her coworkers down. Her "best laid plans" to work until she was age 70, so that all her children could get through college, were dashed. Her saving grace was medication (for anti-seizure and herpes) the neurologist gave her. She said, " After just three days, it was like a black cloud was lifted."
Why we recommend passage: Despite relatively high average teacher pay, the Twinsburg schools deliver some of the best academic value in Northeast Ohio, as an "excellent with distinction" school system that spends just $9,700 per student -- 15 percent of whom are economically disadvantaged.

My notes from the sweepstakes round at the Chronicle competition say the wine suggests in its sunny richness the finer zinfandels of the Sierra foothills, but I didn't peg it to Fiddletown.

There may sometimes be validity to this argument. An officer, for example, who shoots a gang member could be targeted for retribution. On the other hand, on the streets, crooks and cops are not strangers to one another. No officer's identity is a perfectly kept secret, which is why many officers take steps to keep their names and addresses out of public records.

The limits — three two-year terms for a member of the Assembly and two four-year terms for a senator — thrust rookies into leadership positions, and their inexperience shows.

Anyway: if you owned a store and got robbed, what would be your most serious concern? Would it be (A) having to hand over the money; or (B) being assaulted, kicked in the head, and needing to be carted off in a stretcher? Having your cash stolen is bad, but suffering a vicious physical attack is worse. I speak from experience here; in running a family business a long time ago, I was robbed twice. I found that handing over the cash was a better option than being smacked over the head with a gun. And yes, both things happened to me. Again, this is a very, very loose analogy. But Belichick did the football equivalent of stealing money; the Saints were guilty of planning wanton physical attacks in advance, attacks that were designed to injure opponents. Both are wrong. I just think the bounty garbage was more serious.

Opponents included lawmakers from both parties. A handful of Democrats and Republicans rose in vain to try and stop the DUI blood standard. Sen. Pat Steadman, a Denver Democrat, made the point that marijuana users who legally use the drug could be unfairly deemed impaired.

The purist can opt for straightup Thai food at Nitally's: spicy basil chicken ($7.99), red curry/coconut milk panang shrimp ($9.99) and so forth.

Since both cuisines can kick up the spice level, there is usually a nice slow burn to a dish at Nitally's, and the juxtaposition of Thai basil or punchy ginger with corn tortilla brings out the essential deliciousness of each.

Why do fireflies flit about at night? To mate — fireflies use a system of flashes to signal their attraction and availability to the opposite sex. When a male sees an answering flash, he points his light organ directly at the female to make sure she gets the full effect. But sometimes, the return flicker is not what it seems; it could be the mimicry of a female firefly from another genus, which will proceed to have the poor male for dinner.

But at roughly $5,000, the EndoBarrier, considered an advanced investigational device in the United States, is not a permanent solution to diabetes, even for patients who respond well to it.

And while it can be put in place in 25 minutes under sedation that keeps a patient conscious, it was found in one study presented this week to have slipped, become obstructed, or caused problems leading to its removal in more than one-in-three cases. Intestinal bleeding can result if it becomes dislodged.

The group's music crossed genres and color lines, and helped bring rap to a wider audience.

And she had the attributes of a natural-born traveler: "She was absolutely fearless," said Bob Bostock, curator of the exhibit.

Hamlisch doesn't take things too seriously because, frankly, he doesn't have to. He's got nothing to prove. When Hamlisch was on the podium, leading the orchestra in "One" from "A Chorus Line," he was not only conducting it — he wrote the score.
