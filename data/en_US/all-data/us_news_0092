Lowdown: It's time for Poyer to make his mark as an every-down position player. Nerves of steel and a short memory are key requirements for a corner in OSU's aggressive press coverage system, and Poyer fills the bill. He is also an excellent special teams player who averaged 27.5 yards on kickoff returns (No. 2 Pac-10) and 9.5 yards on punt returns last season and was second on the team in all-purpose yards at 1,109 (92.4 per game). Poyer made 34 tackles at corner after moving over from safety, with four pass break-ups and two interceptions. Poyer returned an interception 65 yards for a TD in the Beavers' 36-7 romp over No. 20 USC. He is expected to start at left corner opposite veteran Brandon Hardin, with Rashaad Reynolds and Sean Martin also in the rotation.

AVOID TROUBLE HUBS. If you can't avoid hubbing entirely, you can at least minimize hubbing risks by routing yourself through a hub not likely to encounter severe winter weather. During the first quarter of the year, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Houston, and Phoenix generally report lowest percentages of late arrivals. Despite lots of snow, Denver and Salt Lake City also do pretty well -- at least they know how to cope with heavy snows. Even though it's in the South, Atlanta doesn't do quite as well as other sunbelt hubs. The dishonor roll of hubs to avoid is obvious: Chicago/O'Hare, the New York airports, and San Francisco. For travel to Europe, Washington/Dulles is a better winter gateway bet than airports to the north, and Los Angeles beats San Francisco for travel to Asia.

Research by the Federal Reserve shows that writing down debt is not only the most effective way to keep borrowers in their homes but also can cut a lender's losses significantly. Nevertheless, lenders have been timid when it comes to debt reduction, fearful that borrowers who aren't in trouble would default just to obtain a modification.
That distinction may explain the support of Facebook, which was one of the many technology firms opposed to SOPA.

10. May 12 – Jason Pine, 24. Found stabbed in the 7400 block of Southeast Steele Street. Police say Jason E. Ojard, 36, whom Pine had tried to help that morning, stabbed Pine and dumped his body in the street. Ojard had been at the Pine home and was acting "crazy," Pine's mother Tamitha Pine told police. Her son told her he was going to Ojard's residence around the corner to try to get Ojard to take his "meds." Ojard is accused of murder, second-degree abuse of corpse and manufacture of marijuana. Two witnesses saw Ojard carrying Pine's body into the 7400 block of Southeast Steele Street. Pine was found lying in the street, his hands resting on his abdomen. Police were called at 5:58 p.m. Police tried to get Ojard out of his house. They loud-hailed him, then used bean bags and a Taser. Finally, he emerged from the house, telling police, "Would you like me to kill another one?" and he had blood on his shorts. Inside Ojard's house, police found two large knives, including one with blood on it. The walls were splattered with blood; blood stains were on a love seat and living room carpet. An autopsy found that Pine had been stabbed 29 times, on his head, neck, chest, abdomen and back. Police had a sample of Ojard's blood taken to determine if he was on any prescribed or controlled substances. SOLVED

The Jets are loaded with depth on the defensive line, and that will allow Ryan to mix and match players at different spots. It could be Coples and Muhammad Wilkerson, the team's top pick last year, on the ends and Sione Pouha in the middle of the 3-4 base defense. Or, Ryan could rotate Coples with incumbent starter Mike DeVito, and mix in others such as Marcus Dixon, Ropati Pitoitua and Kenrick Ellis with a four-man front.

Conservative leaders and groups harvest those emotions to raise money and energize their supporters. And yet, when conservatives perceive it in their interest, they do not hesitate to deliver their message through those traditional channels. They are entirely comfortable throwing rocks at the big media institutions and then stepping through the broken glass to dispense a sound biteor, for that matter, to dish dirt over cocktails.

At the same time, knowing he owed taxes, Sharrak continued to pay himself in cash from the adult entertainment clubs he ran, gambled at casinos with large sums of money drawn from those same accounts, and used financial accounts he controlled that were in the names of nominees to pay his bills, records show.
Lambe scored his second goal of the game four minutes later. Ryan Johnson got open on the left side of the penalty area and feigned a shot, bringing Sean Johnson off his line.

Lately, it seems as if her acting comes in two varieties: artful drag burlesques (the Anna Wintourish tyrant Miranda Priestly in “The Devil Wears Prada,” the cluck-clucking Julia Child in “Julie & Julia” and the holy terror nun in “ Doubt”) and relaxed diva charm-fests (aging hippie Donna of “Mamma Mia!” and the spurned Santa Barbara divorcée rediscovering romance in “It's Complicated”). And in both these modes the overriding effect is one of elaborate imposture. She's either impersonating a character quite unlike herself (ah, Streep the magician!) or one who bears a teasing resemblance to her starry middle-aged persona (oh, that lovable grande dame!).

The 49ers filled out the depth chart at just about every position on the roster and used their first-round pick on a position, wide receiver, that was wobbly at the end of last season. Fourth-round pick Joe Looney, a guard, might have fallen because of a recent foot injury. But if he's healthy, he could be a steal in the middle of the draft. Sixth-rounders Trenton Richardson and Jason Slowey could pay dividends in the future. If either fifth-rounder Darius Fleming or seventh-rounder Cam Johnson develops as planned, it will boost a defense that already is one of the best in the league. If there's a critique, it's that the team's first two picks, wideout A.J. Jenkins and running back LaMichael James, don't fit the 49ers' mold of big, stout players. Jenkins did not have to deal with much press coverage at Illinois, and at 193 pounds, he's slight of frame. But perhaps diverging from form was the point.
"If you can't touch Clay and you can't touch (Kansas City Democrat Emanuel) Cleaver, who's left?" said George Connor, head of the political science department at Missouri State University. "If the Democrats have to choose, it's easiest to give up on Carnahan."

“You can’t fault Trey,” said Fassel, who would be fired after the 2003 season. “I remember he said it cost us the Super Bowl, but I don’t want him to feel that way.

"But I think it's way too early to begin narrowing down who the potential vice presidential nominees might be," he said.

"Hold it in," thankfully, is a dictum that this production directed by Jon Kretzu doesn't follow. It moves energetically from start to finish - perhaps too energetically at the start. The first scene which includes the projection of an "instant message" on-line conversation moves so quickly that its climax is rushed along with the first dialogue scene in which Solomon's frustrations with adult censorship are introduced.

In the Mission, no one I knew had kids -- just one friend of a friend. I dressed up to go to cafes, with the idea that everyone was single. In Bernal, wearing sweatpants is fine. Everyone seems to be attached, and pregnant yogis are the norm. I overhear parents at Martha Bros. Coffee Shop debating quandaries that I had never even considered: Is it immoral to have only one child? Will she be lonely and maladjusted? A young father and mother debated the question at length. I eavesdropped, mesmerized. As a childless writer who can barely manage paying my own bills and scheduling my own doctor appointments, I never considered having more than one!

Drivers of these cars often conduct themselves as if there's a privacy fence around them. Personal theory: The anonymity of tinted windows contributes to overly aggressive driving.

"Sweet Thunder" is by far the best of these books and, in describing an athlete now universally acknowledged as the greatest prizefighter who ever lived, better also than Robinson's own collaborative autobiography. Anyone who ever saw him in the ring, or has watched a film of one of his bouts, understands why boxing fans paradoxically insist on calling their sport "the sweet science." Because his professional record included multiple welter- and middleweight titles and a stunning overall record of 174-19-6, it's often unappreciated that Robinson was, along with Jesse Owens, the greatest amateur athlete of the 20th century. He won all 85 of his amateur fights, 69 by knockout, 40 in the first round.

Hate is a pretty strong charge  but I can understand it, especially on an emotional level. One reader, who knows Father Ratigan, spoke eloquently about the conflicting emotions these stories have brought to the surface. When you wonder if your trust, that was so strong for so many years, was maybe misplaced, you can't help but feel like the news media, even if you're trying to make it fair, are just an attack dog, he said.

The most effective device for preventing deaths and injuries in motor vehicle crashes remains the seat belt. Over 2,000 unbuckled drivers and front seat passengers died on New Jersey roadways in the past 10 years. And approximately 700, unbuckled drivers and front seat passengers were thrown out of their vehicles during crashes in the last 10 years. Seat belt usage saves lives and reduces serious injuries.

6. Sammi Giancola: The self-proclaimed “sweetest b---- you’ll ever meet” wasn’t as bratty as you’d expect when she hosted an OK! Magazine party at Vertigo Sky Lounge in the Dana Hotel in Sept. 2010, but she was the one cast member whose publicist made a request before the interview: No questions about her relationship with Ronnie. That would be like the rep for the Baha Men saying “No questions about ‘Who Let the Dogs Out?’”

On to Sweden for a traditional caraway cross — a classic Easter bread and predecessor to the legendary Swedish Lent bun semla. But while the modern semla is a decadent sweet meal in itself (picture something like a small hamburger bun filled with whipped cream), the caraway cross is more down to earth, with a hint of exotic spices — something delicately between cake and bread.
Maryland has another advantage over other states, he said. In October 2005, the state passed a law that allows pet owners to sue for up $7,500 for the death or injury of a pet. The law allows a pet owner to collect damages in excess of a pet's market or replacement value.

Case in the Classic: The bad boy of harness racing, Walter Case Jr. could be back in a racing sulky soon, according to his new wife, Luanne Case.

After the game, Thibodeau was asked what Boozer could do to help the Bulls extend this waste of time. The coach listed stuff such as passing, playmaking, rebounding, posting up, hitting from the outside, blah, blah and blah, because the coach could've said that about any of his players.

I knew we would one day open our own restaurant, a dream we shared since our mother was diagnosed with cancer when my brother was just 17. It was a dream my mother wished for him but didn't live to see. Our father also dreamed of running his own restaurant but he died young of cancer when my brother was 5 years old.

Just because the Suns have salary-cap space does not mean they will spend it all in free agency this summer. They could make a trade taking on salary to acquire what they want or they could float the space into the summer of 2013's free agency, asking for more patience from fans.
“Shenandoah” allowed one to simply enjoy his sound, but there could have been just a little more dynamic range in Barber’s “Sure on this Shining Night.”

The festive fund-raiser raked in some serious lettuce - more than $275,000 - for the Botanic Garden's Community Garden Programs: Green Youth Farm and Windy City Harvest. These shared plots, located in low-income areas in and around Chicago, help educate residents about healthy eating, gardening and entrepreneurship while increasing access to fresh produce and creating beautiful, neighborhood spaces for all to enjoy. Dinner vice-chair Susan Spears (who attended with her husband David) described the programs as "victory gardens for the 21st century. They are about futures, and they are about hope."
Benson and other advocates of the Corporate Accountability Amendment argue that political expenditures by corporations dwarf what unions spend to promote their favored candidates and causes. She's right about that: According to the Center for Responsive Politics, corporations spend nearly $20 for every dollar organized labor spends to influence elections or government policy. And labor unions are already required to report their expenditures to the federal government.

Bowlsby, who last summer signed an extension to remain at Stanford through 2017, has overseen the Cardinal athletic department since 2006 and Stanford has experienced some of its greatest football success in that span, coming off successive Bowl Championship Series appearances.

Jernigan is playing in the Super Bowl now. There is a chance he might not step onto the field, of course. Jernigan is a rookie. He does not have a single catch this season, pitching in mostly on special teams. He is living in the NFL margins, waiting for his chance to make an impact for the first time as a pro.

It would create a dead zone for commuters and tourists. Even if the apartment building's bottom floor would offer a multipurpose room and fitness center, those amenities would be for residents. That means light-rail passengers would have to walk past this building to reach anything of interest to them, wasting an opportunity to engage visitors -- and their money -- as they step off the trains.

The U.S. Forest Service limits the number of people in some wilderness areas, including Mt. Whitney. We could apply for a permit six months before our desired exit date. We set up a telephone call schedule, and Jacquie snagged our permit on the third day of trying.
That is a question well worth considering. Molina noticeably was absent from the Winter Warm-Up and baseball writers' dinner activities last weekend. Of course, he was absent the year before when Pujols was here. More important, is how does management view the urge to re-sign Molina? There is no replacement for Molina in the system and he'll get a ton of money if he gets to free agency. Yet, he doesn't seem like he wants to be the face of the franchise here either in a long-term deal.
"As of this point the investigation is still under investigation and we are investigating the threat," he said.
Mokudai, crisply attired in a suit and tie, is far too professional to dwell on introspection. Privately, like all Japanese in these unspeakably tragic times, he mourns the dead and counts the blessings of those who survived.
Which is why Wang is not exactly sanguine about the future: "I’m sure our society will continue to have this problem for many years to come."

"Anything more?" the waitress in the dirndl asked.
10. Besides enjoying the new Dr. John album (and hearing the clear influences of The Black Keys on it) on the drive up from Chicago on Thursday morning, I wondered if the personality of the manager the Cardinals now have would influence this rivalry as much as the personality of the manager the Cardinals used to have helped created it. Tony La Russa was a known agitator. Matheny, who folks here were calling "The Toughest Brewer Ever," has yet to define himself as a manager. He appears to be an advocate – a manager who rises to the defense of his players. La Russa was fond of pitting his team against the world, identifying a team or a pitcher or a player who had somehow wronged the Cardinals and was a reason to be motivated. Matheny, in his public comments, seems more likely to focus on internal motivation.
"I say to the people of the neighboring countries, and to our allies in the European Union and NATO, we offer them friendship and respect - which also means that we expect the same respect and friendship back," Ader said. "The homeland before all else!"
