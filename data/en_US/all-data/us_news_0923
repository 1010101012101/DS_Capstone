A cafe-style area near the entrance is a good spot for productive, early-morning coffee-and-pastry fixes.

Anyone who saw trumpeter Avishai Cohen play with the SFJAZZ Collective last month at the Mondavi knows he is a remarkable young musician who happens to be Jewish. His cultural and religious heritage comes more to the forefront this weekend at SFJAZZ-sponsored Israeli Jazz Fest at the Jewish Community Center in San Francisco. Cohen will play with two of the three groups performing in the mini festival curated by his sister, saxophonist and clarinetist Anat Cohen. On Saturday the collective Third World Love performs with Avishai Cohen, Yonatan Avishai on piano, Daniel Freedman and drums and Omer Avital on bass.
I used it to create a grape arbor in our backyard. It's gotten to the point where no one who knows me is surprised to see me drive by with a log hanging out the back of my car. In fact, I hauled so many logs -- trees, really -- in our old Honda wagon that an axle eventually broke.

øConsider: I first wrote my best-selling book, The Small Business Bible, in 2003. There is nary a mention of social media in that first edition because it didn't exist. I wrote the second edition in 2007, and the only social media site I mention was . . . MySpace (yikes!) because that was it at the time. So when my editor asked me last year if I had anything new to say if we did a third edition, I was happy to report that yes, I sure did. (And incidentally, the book just came out and has about a dozen new chapters on, yes, social media, technology, etc.)

A former Louisiana high school state champion in the 100 meters, Claiborne doesn't have elite speed by NFL standards, but he's obviously fast enough. He has very long arms for the position, the better to jam receivers at the line of scrimmage. Even so, he's not as physical as some would like, and coach Jeff Fisher is known to like aggressive cornerbacls. (Just watch Finnegan play for proof of that.)

I want to be looked at as Chris Bridges, the person who is trying to work as a character actor. Once people get to know the 'Chris Bridges' name, I will take 'Ludacris' completely out of there when it comes to acting. That's my goal. I wouldn't say I'm really close to that, but I would say that I definitely am on the right path.

Others counter that a few Horatio Alger bootstrap stories can't sugarcoat the continued suffering of the 17% of India's 1.2 billion people facing discrimination under an ancient, complex system that traditionally determined one's occupation and social status at birth, with Brahmins at the top and "unclean" dalits at the bottom shoveling human waste.
There are no Ewings or Yaos in this draft class. The consensus Nos. 1 and 2 picks are Duke's scoring point guard Kyrie Irving and Arizona small forward Derrick Williams.

Don't think the tradition doesn't continue. In recent years the cookie recipe has become some kind of litmus test for domestic bliss for political candidates. Hence, the McCain oatmeal cookies and Michelle Obama's shortbread, one of a cadre of recipes in the "Obama Campaign Family Cookbook" posted on Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

Jeff Zrebiec (Ravens/NFL reporter): The Denver Broncos got Peyton Manning's first visit and they seemed to be the most logical landing spot for the quarterback all along.

"If you set aside the obvious answer that people are uncomfortable with change,'' Sano said, "I think there was simply a lack of trust that I, and therefore the Asian, knew what we would be doing. I think there was an underlying fear that we would disrespect the pantings, rip them off the wall and trash them in the middle of the night. They associated me and the Asian with Asian art, and this was clearly not Asian art,'' even allowing the influence of woodblock printing on Piazzoni's work.

Kevin Pelton: It's hard to give Johnson anything but an incomplete for his rookie season. As much excitement as Johnson generated during the preseason, it was never realistic to expect him to contribute much right away.

Los Angeles, CA (Sports Network) - Kobe Bryant poured in 38 points to propel the Los Angeles Lakers to a 104-100 Western Conference quarterfinal Game 2 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday. Andrew Bynum followed up his Game 1 triple-double with a playoff career-high 27 points and Pau Gasol contributed 13 points and 10 rebounds to help the Lakers hold on in a game they never trailed.

Mike Brown's decisions and adjustments were not enough obviously. His offense failed in the last three games. But that isn't the worst of it. The Cavs allowed 100.5 points and 47 percent shooting in this series. Worse than the regular season. In a series when the game should have slowed down and defense should have been at a premium. Last season against the Magic, the Cavs gave up 104 points and 48 percent shooting. His defense failed when it was needed most two years in a row and that is his strong suit. That is why he has the job.

I know many young people who've finished college feeling fortunate to get a job earning just above minimum wage. Other young adults, such as teachers, in jobs paying a decent wage, may not have seniority and face layoffs as the "last hired" in districts nationwide that are cutting back. It's why protests such as Occupy Wall Street in New York, Washington, D.C., Kansas City and other places have caught fire. People are angry, and they don't see a future for themselves or their families.

"That was really the word I was looking for to completely support how I felt about it," Barfield said. "I didn't have real evidence of actual contact.

Although the new studies describe possible ways that the drugs could cause atypical leg breaks, they cannot say how often this might happen or who is at risk. Solomon says the best evidence to date is a 2009 study published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research — the same paper, as it happens, on which the FDA based its announcement that not enough evidence exists to make a connection. Using medical records from nearly 12,000 patients in a Danish registry, it found similarly low rates of atypical fractures in patients taking bisphosphonates and patients not taking the drugs.
Wright noted that the first signs the outside world got of North Korea's long-range Taepodong-2 missile — upon which the recent failed rocket was based — was from mock-ups seen in 1994, 12 years before it was actually tested on the launch pad.

At Drew, 97 percent of last year’s freshman class earned scholarships or grants, said David Muha, a university spokesman. The average freshman paid $20,000 in tuition after financial aid was deducted from the bill.
He said wilderness fires that spread to threaten homes can be attacked in a strategic manner, with "point protection" at key areas rather than trying to contain them with wide perimeter assaults. "Instead we have taxpayers paying the bill and parents are paying the price for fighting fires far away from these communities," he said.

I’m really at a loss as to how to respond to your last email. The County has been trying to move this process along in good faith. We have quieted the voices who have complained that your office is obstructing progress on the deal and we have responded to City concerns in a substantive way, in writing. After months of conversations between our offices, I sent you a draft IGA for your input and changes on August 13th. In return, my phone messages have been ignored and I’ve received vague emails seemingly designed to string the process along. Your office has yet to approve any language in the IGA – not even the points the Mayor, in writing, agreed to over a year ago. It’s mind-boggling that after all this time, nothing on the City’s end seems to progress. To keep the project on track, the County must begin purchasing right of way in January. To begin purchasing, we need to bond against our VRF in October, something we can’t do if we don’t have a secure commitment from the City. Please confirm that the Mayor is still committed to this project.

In the first six-month phase of the study, participants were focused on losing weight via diet and moderate exercise. They had to lose at least 9 pounds in order to take part in the second phase of the trial, which concentrated on weight loss maintenance. Information on good eating and exercise habits, plus weekly group meetings, helped them along.

One suspects that President Obama would dearly love to drill a lot for more oil and gas, simply for the political windfall in jobs and economic growth. But after he flipped on offshore drilling, then flopped after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, he cannot flip again without infuriating his base. So he brags about how much more drilling there is today, even though that's the result of policies already in the pipeline.
Preparing for a more consistent campaign in 2011-12, Halak has addressed concerns the Blues had about his fitness with a productive summer of training that included drenching bike rides through the hills of his native Bratislava, Slovokia.

After the meeting broke up Friday night, French Finance Minister Francois Baroin said they were "headed in the right direction" on these issues and their differences were narrowing. A tussle over how best to use the bailout fund derailed promises to unveil a grand plan at Sunday's summit meeting. European leaders have now scheduled another summit for Wednesday.
There was something familiar about Limbaugh's gratuitous slurs. They recalled an episode five years ago when shock jock Don Imus slammed a group of women who, like Fluke, were innocent bystanders on the public stage, guilty only of doing yeoman duty that thrust them into the spotlight: the Rutgers University women's basketball team.
During the past three decades, the Champenois have come to feel at home in California. Not all have stayed, but those who did quietly played a defining role in the style, and quality, of American sparkling wines. After years of confusion in the marketplace about what their California-made wines represent -- brand extensions of familiar names or inexpensive second fiddles? -- they seem to have hit their stride. The best French Champagnes are unquestionably more refined, but these New World wines more than hold their own with nonvintage and even some vintage Champagne. Good Champagne may be a triumph of winemaking, but the American wines have defined themselves with more approachable aromas and bursts of fresh fruit flavors.

At least one of the brothers got out of the car, and words were exchanged, Wiggins said, then the man got back inside to monitor the teen. Ausby, meanwhile, armed himself with a board out of fear, pulling it from a nearby wooden pallet and dislodging several nails in the process. That's when Eliyahu, a former Israeli special forces soldier, grabbed the high school student and slammed him to the ground, Wiggins said, while Avi hit him in the head with a Shomrim-issued walkie talkie.

The message of capitalist dynamism in the Newsweek story supports Mitt Romney’s belief in the wonders of the market, yet it is not the story he will tell on the campaign trail. He will be talking about those jobless working stiffs in Ohio and blaming their plight on Barack Obama. Obama, of course, will be playing up the economic success stories, especially the revival of the auto industry for which he will take credit, and he will insist more jobs are on the way.

Mr. Obama didn't threaten to veto the bill if it didn't meet his standards, as he did during his State of the Union address and again as recently as a few days ago.That could be because the Senate legislation appears to reflect all of his major priorities, as aides have fought off many of the changes he found objectionable.
"I don't think he was trying to hit home runs. I think he was just trying to be aggressive," Davis said. "He's a smart kid, he knows what he wants to do, and he can explain what's going on. ... He's hitting the ball hard and in the air. If he's a bigger hitter, those are doubles or homers."

Efforts at bringing the Taliban into negotiations have long failed to make progress for multiple reasons. Some Taliban figures have been willing to enter talks but their actual influence within the movement has proven unclear. Members of the Taliban are not always on the same page, and the movement includes several powerful allies that could feel threatened by any peace effort. One such ally, the Pakistan-based Haqqani network, has emerged as one of the biggest threats to Afghanistan's stability, and nearly all Taliban attacks in and around the Afghan capital have been blamed on the group.
An arrest warrant issued Wednesday accuses Keller of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of first-degree arson; the home was set on fire after Lynnettee Keller, 41, and Kaylene were each shot in the head.

Keret, a well-known cultural figure in Israel, took 10 years to put this collection together. In the interim, he's gotten married, had a son, taken a teaching position at Tel Aviv University and co-written and co-directed the feature film "Jellyfish," which won the first feature award at Cannes in 2007. In interviews about "Suddenly, a Knock On the Door," he has said stability and success slowed his short-story writing — that makes sense, since he began writing in a dark moment, after a close friend committed suicide. In 2005, Keret told the Believer that his stories are "like letters sent from the id to the superego." That combination of unmediated extremes — imagination and control — is in these stories, often buffeted by winds of serendipity and chaos.

Anderson’s strong musical rapport with guitarist Martin Barre — who has been with Jethro Tull almost as long as Anderson has — is a joy to watch. Barre’s jaunty playing on the folkier numbers was assured, but the veteran rocker seemed thrilled to get to the rougher material from “Aqualung .” Multi-instrumentalist John O’Hara also impressed: his stuttering digital harpsichord solo on “King Henry’s Madrigal” was an highlight of a show distinguished by its displays of virtuosity. (Anderson returns to the region this autumn — he’ll be doing solo shows at the Mayo Center in Morristown on Oct. 21, and Wellmont Theater in Montclair on Nov. 17.)
Renard and the foreign Accent Guy have a cryptic conversation. Accent Guy tells Renard he needs to control this Grimm or get rid of him, because things are getting out of balance. Renard says the Grimm -- that would be Nick, in case anybody has forgotten -- has a badge and a conscience. Well, that's your problem, says Accent Guy, and Renard says I know you are but what am I? Wait, no, he says, next time you might want to deliver your message in person. And Acccent Guy says next time we will. Ominousness ensues.

The new law has “provided an incentive for insurers to seek lower premium increases than they would have otherwise,” the report said. “This ‘sentinel' effect on premiums has likely produced more savings for consumers and employers than the rebates themselves.”

Add it all up, and the plan I'm proposing will cost around $900 billion over ten years - less than we have spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and less than the tax cuts for the wealthiest few Americans that Congress passed at the beginning of the previous administration. Most of these costs will be paid for with money already being spent - but spent badly - in the existing health care system. The plan will not add to our deficit. The middle-class will realize greater security, not higher taxes. And if we are able to slow the growth of health care costs by just one-tenth of one percent each year, it will actually reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over the long term.
That proximity will make the moon appear about 14 percent bigger than it would if the moon were at its farthest distance, said Geoff Chester of the U.S. Naval Observatory. The difference in appearance is so small that "you'd be very hard-pressed to detect that with the unaided eye," he said.
Remove pan from oven and turn meat over, placing ribs in the center of the pan. Add the potatoes and Brussels sprouts in a single layer around the ribs, then sprinkle with the garlic and sea salt. Drizzle remaining 2 tablespoons of the oil over the vegetables. Return pan to oven and roast 30 minutes more. Stir the sprouts and potatoes again, pour off excess fat, and roast for another 20 to 30 minutes, until the meat and vegetables are tender. Serve at once.

What Mike performed was based on the assumption that Mike was telling the truth. He spoke in the first person. He gave detailed accounts of many things he witnessed. He made it seem like it was happening—to him. And he didn't give me (or probably anyone else) the idea he kind of saw something. That's the show. If you said, "Some of these things are real and some aren't," you wouldn't have a show. You'd just have a sort of opinion, which people hear on cable news every day. Who cares about that?
Babbitt told an international aviation club on Wednesday that aviation is facing an "extreme need to refocus on professionalism."

It's no secret that lots of college athletes -- lots of college students, for that matter -- participate in recreational drug use, and many of them smoke weed. An interesting discussion got started on Twitter yesterday about if Harris' comment of "we smoked it all" was the wise thing to say, legally. One fan said yes, because you can't get in trouble for smoking weed; you can only get in trouble for possession. That's a fair point, but I argued back that the smarter thing to say would have been "We don't have any," or something along those lines.

It seems all the talk in Columbus, Ohio, this week has been on Urban Meyer's possible hiring as head coach. Good thing. The Buckeyes on the field aren't too great a topic, even with Michigan on the calendar. Ohio State has won seven in a row in the series but this year's team can't really throw the ball and has struggled at 6-5. The Wolverines (9-2) have returned to playing "Michigan defense" as coach Brady Hoke said this week. Michigan is top 10 in the country in scoring defense and could be in line for a BCS at-large bid with a victory.

A.J. Bockelman, executive director of the Missouri-based gay advocacy group PROMO, said he suspects the bill here may have been inspired - at least in part - by the American Civil Liberties Union's fight to unfilter gay-friendly websites on school computers.

Under the agreement, the district had to stop blocking content based on gay-positive viewpoints.

Also, it made me realize that so much of what makes the subject of diversity uncomfortable is that it raises topics that people find awkward and anxiety-producing. No one likes feeling that way. We particularly don't like feeling that way if we think that seeing the other person's perspective concedes some wrongness on our part.
Currency manipulation issues have dogged Washington for years. When Bush was president, a number of senators -- including a freshman from Illinois named Obama -- wrote to ask that he seek trade sanctions against China for currency manipulation. The Bush administration, including Portman when he joined it, contended that it lacked authority to do that because currency issues were not governed by international trade rules. Instead, Bush left it to his Treasury Department for negotiation with China.
The latest campaign finance records reveal that dozens of private companies, hedge funds and business partnerships contributed to super PACs last year. But in an initial review of the filings, Chesapeake Energy, a natural gas producer based in Oklahoma City, appears to be the only publicly traded company that gave money, making a $250,000 donation to a super PAC backing Rick Perry's since-suspended presidential bid.
Not surprisingly, Valor Christian, which will continue nonleague play next week against Pueblo South at Dutch Clark Stadium in its fourth consecutive road game, outgained the Panthers in yardage 435-65 and used ball control seemingly at will — it ran 66 plays to Pomona's 38 and held more than a 13-minute advantage in possession.

I love that Lula is a hooker with a heart of gold who becomes a bounty hunter. She's in 17 of 18 of the books. For the audition, I did put on my shortest miniskirt and an electric blue tube top. I think it was Elisabeth Hasselbeck's tube top. I also put on my highest hooker heels. I put on this getup in my dressing room at "The View" and added a long Rapunzel wig. When I went into the hallway, I ran smack into Barbara Walters. Barbara sees me and says, "Sherri, where in the world are you going?" I said, "Barbara, I'm going to be a hooker!" Then when I got to the audition, the same production company was also trying out little boys for another movie. So, here I am in that outfit with my boobies falling out looking like a hooker.

Christie’s willingness to give up federal funds was evident earlier this year when he proposed cutting back unemployment benefits. Last year’s federal stimulus act added $25 a week to unemployment checks. Christie’s proposal to drop the maximum weekly benefit from $600 to $550 would sever an agreement with the federal government and could cut unemployment checks by up to $75 a week, according to legislative services.

But the Rev. Walter John Boris, the new leader of the Central Pacific Conference of the United Church of Christ, is quick to observe that size and demographics don't make a church.

The desperation behind these acts is moving, truly moving. It is very human. Anyone who's ever received bad news about a loved one in an intensive care unit will surely understand the fear that makes you willing to do anything to help them recover. (You want me to drink a cupful of splinters? No problem.) Aside from the essential humanity in these practices, though, Freeman suggests something else deeply unsettling to any believer. Relic cults are a clear sign that the God of Christianity must not be loving, but angry and irrational. If he were loving, why would human beings resort to such methods to get his attention?

Outside the Capitol, the rules are not quite the same. At least, that's the bet Tom Steyer is making. He intends to ask voters to do what legislators would not.

The potential for tax-free earnings is enormous when you open a retirement account for a child. Gerald's seven years old -- suppose he gets a paper route earning $100 a month, or $1,200 a year. (The rules for a Roth IRAs require that a child earn income, though they don't say that income must be used to fund the Roth.) If my dad continued to fund Gerald's Roth with his financial gifts over the next 20 years, rather than invest in savings bonds, the value of those gifts would climb to $7,799, according to this calculator. Again, a better deal than bonds.

The problem with that explanation is that if the surface is considered a "sidewalk," as the original press release states, then the bicycles should be on the roadway, with other traffic. And, since there is no connecting sidewalk on either side of the 552-foot bridge, where's the safety gain?

Metro bought the land, which had been farmed in generations past, from the Division of State Lands. The $1.6 million purchase amount, and money spent since then to transform the property came from a pair of bond measures approved by voters: $135 million in 1995 and $227 million in 2006. With the money, Metro has purchased about 8,000 acres from willing sellers in targeted areas of Clackamas, Multnomah and Washington counties. Most of the purchases have been along streams, part of wildlife corridors or contained unusual features. The largest purchase was the $6 million, 1,143-acre Chehalem Ridge forest land; another included a 13-acre wetland near West Linn that contains a fen, a bed of peat moss floating in a shallow lake.

To me, his words on the sideline with his coaches after the tipped interception in the end zone were more of note, as Pryor was clearly making the case that the throw wasn't his fault. Whatever words were said initially caused quarterbacks coach Nick Siciliano to walk away. Jim Tressel reiterated Monday that it's all part of the game. Tressel said typically he's the good cop with Pryor and Siciliano is the bad cop and disagreements, midweek or during the game, are part of it.

Ugh. It's tough to hear stuff like that. Tougher even, I'll bet, to be a parent watching it happen to your child. It's why Grace was warmed by the thought of all those children, toes on the edge of the track, cheering for Mary that day. And why mom's been floored all week with strangers walking up and saying, "Your daughter is amazing!" And it's why mom's eyes got glassy when little Mary bounced out to track practice this week and was greeted by a swarm of teammates who did what the rest of us probably wanted to do all week.
Mouawad set out to craft an acting vehicle for himself and co-artistic director Carol Triffle and it works terrifically on that count, especially when they're portraying the poor Vladimir and Natasha. Mouawad makes the ambitious but under-confident "balloon guy" charming in his neediness, and Triffle's understated but distinctive physical quirks give Natasha many of the show's biggest laughs.

The story was first reported in The Montclair Times today.
My brother looked up and, after looking up a second time, realized the ball was heading for his noggin! He got up and the ball crashed through the wooden seat, breaking two boards. My brother reached to the ground and picked up the second foul ball of the day for the Kramers. Both hit by White Sox batters, but still, a double thrill for us, since they were both our first foul balls.
As a math guy, Spohn did a bit of scientific sleuthing to discover what he considered the culprit behind the fishery's demise. He studied a decade's worth of daily water release data from Eleven Mile Reservoir and Spinney Mountain Reservoir upstream, analyzing it alongside rainbow trout young-of-the-year numbers, then called in the puzzle people responsible for moving water through the system to Denver and Aurora.

As a result, the tsunami didn't result in an extended loss of power at those plants, allowing their operators to quickly cool active reactors and avoid meltdowns.
Wright focuses sections of her book on Islamic youth culture as an instrument of change. Young Muslims, she finds, do not believe their religion requires them to live by rules that have more to do with the practices of a patriarchal 7th-century society than the teachings of the Koran. But many of them are also "strikingly religious and observant." They want to lead modern lives, and they want democratic accountability from their governments, but that doesn't mean they think the secular West has all the answers.

The retirees, for instance, could see their recovery slip from $37.8 million to $22.9 million, plan documents said.

SE-L had enjoyed a 10-year run as an Effective school district prior to last year’s slip to Continuous Improvement, so some may wonder why the district would hire a superintendent from a district that has been in Continuous Improvement. Board members said they were sold on Reid because she does not back down from challenges and she has a great vision for SE-L. Reid told board members every challenge is an opportunity waiting to happen, and it is that kind of leadership that will help bring SE-L back to an Effective rating and maybe even an Excellent rating down the road. As in Mayfield, SE-L residents should feel confident the board has made the right hire in Reid.

I was thoroughly impressed — I thought I was dedicated, but she put me to shame! Time flew and I was surprised when I realized we had been talking for three hours. We exchanged numbers and made loose plans to go out again.
