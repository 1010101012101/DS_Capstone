Plan B: Look no farther than the next island over, St. Barthélemy, where wild and undeveloped Anse de Grande Saline is the solution for a beach lover's most sybaritic dreams. Even on the busiest days it's never packed, and privacy is paramount. From the parking area, a quarter-mile trail leads over a shrub-lined dune to the sand, which is soft, wide and generous. As the island's de facto clothing-optional beach, there are subsections within - hip/gay tend to swing left, newcomers usually head right. It's also probably the local's favorite and lots of networking takes place - play your cards right and you might be invited to a party.
You'll need about four hours - and basic route-finding skills - for this moderately difficult, five-mile loop.

The second half of “Roman Reloaded” is thick with glossy dance-pop, much of which feels as if it were written for and rejected by Rihanna. “Spaceships,” “Pound the Alarm,” “Marilyn Monroe” and other tracks shoot for the top of the charts at all costs and leave Minaj, whose placeholder voice will never be confused with that of Lady Gaga, sounding like a bystander on her own work. Occasionally she’ll surface from the mix and get off a bizarre rhymed couplet just to let you know she’s still there. But then another wave of synthesizer smacks her, and she’s swamped again.

The finance building on Broad Street, one of Newark’s main drags, was mentioned as a good example, along with the city welfare building and the child and family well-being building. The only building not on the table is City Hall, officials said.

“Under President Obama, more Americans have lost their jobs, lost their homes and fallen into poverty than at any time since the Great Depression.

The battles listed above are just a few of the bloody conflicts in which King Kamehameha played a role, so it's almost surprising to learn he had any time for leisure. But he apparently enjoyed his final years at Kailua-Kona, in a compound at Kamakahonu Beach, close to Ahu'ena Heiau, which he had rebuilt; this temple was dedicated to Lono, the god of peace, prosperity and agricutlure. The beach is adjacent to the King Kamehameha's Beach Hotel, which features a Herb Kane mural depicting the monarch and son Liholiho (later Kamehameha II), but may be better known as the race headquarters for the Ironman triathlon world championship.

But in her defense, it was a very hot day.
Ma, who was elected in 2006 and holds the leadership position of majority whip, said she did not know that the rules explicitly forbid voting for another member.

At times is bleak, at times its darkly comic. But the real treat here is getting to see Malkovich demonstrate his dramatic acting chops in a raw, intimate setting.

The good news is that these changes don't need to be monumental. You don't have to run a marathon or climb mountains. Walking 30 to 40 minutes a day and shedding a few extra pounds can fundamentally change your chances of developing diabetes. One large research study found that diet and exercise which resulted in a 5 to 7 percent reduction in weight could lower the risk of diabetes in high-risk individuals by 58 percent. For example, someone who weighs 200 pounds could potentially prevent diabetes by losing just 10 to 15 pounds.

Inspired by Mark Obmascik's nonfiction book, David Frankel's film observes the migratory patterns of three breeds of birders.

Yes and maybe, suggests this gently eccentric film from Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada, Marley & Me).

Those are (ahem) not mainstream points of view in the Republican Party, and you won’t hear any of his talking points on those issues echoed by GOP front-runner Mitt Romney. Or by President Obama, for that matter. Romney has been promoting “economic freedom” lately, but his definition of that phrase seems to have little in common with Paul’s.

Well, I just called on the one down Hanley Road, so we'll see if it does any good. I don't get it.

2. If San Francisco ever wanted to stage a lube embargo and hold the nation hostage under threat of dry, chafing sex until our demands were met, we very well could. Here, you can find every lube imaginable in quality levels from Dom Perignon to Mumm's, and pick up a locally made designer vibrator or butt plug while you're at it. Visit the aforementioned Good Vibrations to experience our true San Francisco treat. Walgreens, which is practically on every corner in the city, has the cheapest condoms and lube in town, though while you'll be floored by the extensive selection of lube at the Castro Walgreens (498 Castro St.), sadly, all of it is bottom-shelf fare. For cheap lube (and more kinds than you'd ever imagine, including many high-quality brands), visit any of the adult stores in the Castro. There's always a lube price war going on in San Francisco, people, and many of these stores make the slippery stuff their loss leader. Take advantage. To get cheap vibrators, you'll find some in the boy-centric Castro shops, but the rock-bottom bargains and selection are in North Beach at "adult bookstores" such as Big Al's (556 Broadway) and Adult Media (Kearny and Clay).

And this movie also makes too much room for Simon Pegg, as a kind of younger, nerdier Q, constantly fiddling with his laptop and screwing things up for the spy team. He's supposed to be the comic relief. He's neither, and I hope he doesn't come back for the next one.
Two options theyve studied closely, Dre Kirkpatrick of Alabama and South Carolinas Stephon Gilmore, are the kind of big, physical corners coach Jim Schwartz and defensive coordinator Gunther Cunningham prefer in a press-bump scheme.

Ken Campbell, The Hockey News: "Vancouver Canucks: Trading Cody Hodgson may come back to haunt them in a big way one day if Hodgson turns out to be one of the best two-way centermen in the league, but that wasn't going to happen with the Canucks anyway and they got a very tough young man in Zack Kassian in return. Kassian addresses the Canucks well-documented need for toughness, but he's also a guy who can play in the playoffs and that is a huge factor. Getting Sami Pahlsson from the Columbus Blue Jackets gives them a third-line center who can still be an effective shut-down player and don't underestimate the possibility that Marc-Andre Gragnani could develop into an offensive force there."

"He's been a great player for a lot of years," Brodeur said. "It's a pleasant surprise that he can play this well at this level in the NHL after being away. He's always been a tough player to go up against. It's a big challenge, but we can't focus on one guy. We can't say that if we just take care of Jagr, we'll be in good shape.

It's a business model that no longer works, said Robinson. Racing revenues are now in a tailspin, and gaming competition is drawing ever closer. Gamblers looking for slots can now take Route 78 to Bethlehem, Pa., an easy drive just over the state's border, to the Sands Casino Resort, or head to the slots at Yonkers Raceway. Thirty years ago, racing at the Meadowlands represented an 81 percent market share of legalized gambling in New Jersey. By 2007, it was down to about 1 percent.

Melissa Gilbert's year: 2010. She fell and broke her back. "It was the most gut-wrenching, painful experience I've had in my life." She said she could "hardly walk, let alone dance," and tears started flowing, but she insisted. "I'm happy." Her jive was a celebration, she said.

Enforcing the list is tricky, because a law enforcement officer has to witness a solicitation violation to issue a citation, according to city officials.

He didn't return.
With American officials all but falling over themselves in pleading with Israel not to attack Iran, the question arises: What would be worse for the region, the prospect of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons capability, or an Israeli military strike to prevent that ("Iran threat appears to add crack in U.S.-Israel bond," Feb. 22)? While the first situation might conceivably lead to war — if the Iranian leadership were insane or suicidal, which they're not — the second option will definitely initiate a military chain reaction involving surrounding countries and the U.S. with unforeseen and devastating consequences.

“Because what I say can be heavy or kind of challenging, I try to make it as cavalier as possible,” said Che. “It offers contrast and people don’t take it as seriously.

Yet, the re-occurrence is lost on Elliott. Bring it up and he stares blanks at you, as if you just said something that made no sense, as if you tried to go five-hole with a medicine ball. Elliott, 27, is as pragmatic as he is long - and he is long at 6 feet 2, to be exact. He doesn't see things in ironic, satirical or coincidental ways.

Here is a list of Republicans who voted yes then, and then no on the veto overrides Thursday, on at least one of the bills.

The Monkees were four actors and musicians specially assembled in 1966 to create a television sitcom about, appropriately, four young guys who are musicians.

About retirement benefits, CalPERS changed its rate of return, which means it will no longer meet its goals as projected, and will pass on the shortfall to anyone participating in the plan, Ritzma said. "We expect to see increased in our rates for pensions because of that. We will not see that in our current year, but in 2013, when they start with the new formula. We have in all our contracts cost-sharing language. The employees will share in the increased cost. We used to carry all our unfunded liability to CalPERS, but we pulled all that into a pension obligation bond. We got a fixed rate for our pension liability, between 1 percent and 5 percent, depending on the year. We will not be incurring that loss on our unfunded liability."

They also told the officers who found them that they had not had food or water for three days, said Mississippi Highway Patrol Master Sgt. Steve Crawford.
His early career had several stops in Florida, including Ft. Myers, where the Kansas City Royals held spring training. He got to know Whitey Herzog, the team's manager at the time, and said Herzog made a huge impact on his career - an opening came up at a Kansas City TV station and Herzog was in his corner.

There are 41 shorts (1929-1935), 10 features (1931-1940) and seven foreign-language films. These are not merely overdubbed, but fresh performances in which the boys speak Spanish and French — albeit, with precarious pronunciation — while interacting with a different cast. It works surprisingly well, largely because so much of the humor is non-verbal.
What: Music director Jeannette Sorrell and her Cleveland Baroque Orchestra bring back one of their biggest holiday hits. The crackerjack period-instrument orchestra presents Michael Praetorius' glorious "Christmas Vespers" with vocal soloists and antiphonal choirs.
Instead, before a partisan crowd of 10,747, the Tigers improved to 5-0 with a 92-53 romp over Cal (4-1) a day after they pummeled Notre Dame 87-58.

That question has been on my mind as I've been plunging through my ever-growing pile of books (I'm sure it is a disease). Two titles are particularly capturing my attention this Lenten season. One is new, the other classic; both are giving me new hope for the church and deeper understandings of what it means to be in community.
Up to 300 Occupy Riverside protesters set up tents on the Main Street mall on Oct. 15, but those numbers dwindled over time.

Projections of women’s names — Cleopatra and Sappho among them — which first appeared during the overture came back as Donna Elvira began to comprehend the extent of Giovanni’s conquests. Then, with a hint of flirtation, Leporello displays not just one, but a collection of such books, one filled during each of Giovanni’s journeys. The one from Spain — where 1,003 succumb to the master’s charms — is unabridged-dictionary sized.

The team was confident enough of getting in that it had a small gathering in Chaifetz Arena to watch the announcement. All signs pointed to SLU being in the field, but there was still a slight level of anxiety in the room - "It was a mixture of nervous and exciting, which is a weird feeling," forward Cody Ellis said - though much of that was allayed when Xavier, a team SLU had beaten twice, was revealed as getting an at-large berth.
Granted, this low-budget independent sports comedy defaults to clichés. There's the by-the-numbers romance, the nerd, the wild house party, the big game.
The DeSisto School was founded in 1978 by Michael DeSisto as an institution to help troubled students through an intense discipline regimen and group therapy. Students were primarily from wealthy, prominent families who paid up to $78,000 a year for their children to attend.

The summit was sponsored by GE Capital and OSU's Fisher College of Business. The goal of the conference is to help medium-sized companies brainstorm and share ideas for overcoming challenges and growing into larger, global companies.
Few VCs could make comparable claims at such a young age, or be as clear as Efrusy about the entrepreneurs he wants to work with - people who sound a lot like Zuckerberg. "When I meet with someone, I ask myself: Are they stubborn? They should be. I'm not interested in someone who responds to the conventional wisdom of boards, or to MBAs like me. I'm interested in the person with a gut conviction of what their product is about and who sticks to it."
Sadly, there will be more situations in which our officers must act to defend themselves or us. We must let them know that when they do so appropriately and according to policy, we as a city will strongly support and fight for them. And we must send a clear message to those who would put the public and our officers at risk as well: If you suffer injury that results from your own violent crimes, don't look to L.A. taxpayers to pay for your medical care for life.

Kasich ended his thoughts with a little Chardon history lesson, recounting how in 1868 most of the city burned to the ground and was rebuilt. The courthouse in the center of the town square was constructed the very next year, he said.
Following the success of two recent gatherings in Honolulu, plans are afoot for monthly Eat the Street rallies of novice and veteran vendors — check Streetgrindz.com for future events. But for the visitor, seeking out these eclectic cafes-on-wheels as part of an island-exploring itinerary is half the fun; the fact that prices may be half of resort fare may also be appetizing (just don't forget to bring cash.)
The governor certainly has a right to his opinion. But he should have the courage to stand up and say it is an opinion based on rejection of Catholic teaching and Maryland jurisprudence.
After a short debate we always start our Whites ski break at the same place: Our favorite peak is actually two - Attitash and Bear. Together they offer 300 acres ribboned with 73 trails - which is where I ski - including seven birch- and spruce-dotted glades (Moe's terrain) winding through Bear's woods. That means lots of choices for a long day on slopes that see about 15 feet of annual natural snow.

The latest research builds on previous studies which have shown that spices can do everything from curb appetites to help cancel out the unhealthy effects of a fatty meal.
But I wouldn't make an overnight visit to this Ritz-Carlton until the staff can offer assurances that all offerings are up and running. And even after that, whether you're a lone grown-up or a traveling family, I don't think the Ritz-Carlton people have given us enough reason to pay Ritz-Carlton prices. After all, it's so much cheaper to sleep downstairs with their corporate cousins, and it's just about as much fun.
David O'Leary, whose bedroom window is about 40 feet from one of the new sirens in University City, said the sound was startling.

It was a sign of things to come. For the past 25 years, Emerson has been working on the radio. Since 1998, when he moved to Portland to host a talk show, Emerson has built a fan base so devoted its members have followed him through radio's inevitable ups, downs, format shifts, ownership changes and firings. Fueled by his obsession with pop culture, music, media and technology, Emerson resonated with listeners who share what he calls his "relentless geekery."
Saying they lost hundreds of millions a year under the old collective bargaining agreement, ratified in 2005, and believing that it favored large-market teams, owners sought significant changes in these negotiations. They refused an option to let the CBA run another year and opened the process in January 2010 with a proposal that called for a hard cap, the elimination of guaranteed contracts, rollbacks of current salaries and a massive reduction in the players' share of basketball-related income.

In 2008, Steven Gluckstein flubbed a trick in the U.S. Olympic trampoline finals, missing a trip to the Beijing Games.
But beards hardly signify manliness the way they did in the days of Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant, and the mustache has been a pop-culture punchline since Tom Selleck and Burt Reynolds hit their peak.
For all the makeovers the Rams have been doing on the field and off, the best thing Kroenke and his people can do right now is to find a favorable resolution to the lease agreement with the CVC. I love all the stuff that is happening with the new coach, the new general manager, the new rookies and the new attitude, but it means next to nothing if the negotiations to upgrade the Dome do not produce a resolution that keeps the Rams here.
Though warm, a night on the train isn't an appealing prospect.

“They found extra money and said, ‘Why don’t we give it to the top kids?’” said Kevin, who scored a 2160 out of 2400 on the SATs, and hopes to study computer software programming at Rowan. His brother, who wants to be a doctor of internal medicine, scored a 1960.
Aviation schools don't like a higher minimum either. They're afraid students would drop out of university programs to seek the shortest route to the first officer's seat through free-lance flight instructors, and by flying crop dusters and towing banners.
I got my first gray hairs when I was 19. Premature gray runs on both sides of my family, and I have to admit that we look pretty interesting when we get together as a group. Even the 20-year-olds are gray.

Brett Morel bunted toward third, where Jack Hannahan fielded cleanly but forced first baseman Casey Kotchman off the bag with a wide throw. Masterson (0-1, 2.77 ERA) got ahead of Adam Dunn, 0-2.

Citing the recent violence, the war opponents present two arguments for an early exit: 1) the anti-American protests show Afghans want foreign troops to leave; and 2) the troop-intensive counterinsurgency efforts have largely failed. Both these claims, however, are inaccurate. First, despite recent protests, a majority of Afghans support the presence of foreign troops in their country and do not want the return of the Taliban. ... Second, real counterinsurgency efforts in Afghanistan only began in early 2010, and have made remarkable progress since then. ... Further accelerating the withdrawal plan will undo the achievements of the past decade and will allow the Taliban and al Qaeda to re-establish their safe havens in parts of Afghanistan from which they could plot attacks on U.S. soil and against our allies in the region.

While "I Survived ..." might sound like your typical true crime show, there are several key differences. First, while many such shows rely on re-enactments of crimes to raise the dramatic stakes, "I Survived .¤.¤." tells its tales using only the words of the survivors, sparse subtitles and footage of the places where the crimes took place. There's no second-rate acting, no heavy-handed narration and only sparse use of the ominous synthesizer music that represents the show's one indulgence in audience manipulation.

A downward push, meanwhile, could indicate investor nervousness over China's slowing economy and the possibility of capital flight if China further loosens its capital restrictions.

Bass Nicholas Nelson lent a grave bass to the role of Pope Urban VIII, and John Holiday, Matthew Hayward and José Rubio were strong and well-matched as his henchmen/Cardinals (Holiday's focused countertenor was especially striking). Lindsay Ohse beguiled as Galileo's daughter Maria Celeste and as the Duchess Christina, though she struggled to make vocal sense of her first appearance.

In short, we will have an untried divided central government, set up to do the bidding of foreigners, trying to rule a backward country seething with tribal hatreds -- with Libya’s multibillion-dollar oil industry as the prize for anyone ruthless enough, as Khadafy was, to emerge on top.
