The federal Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Congress, was in the middle of a legislative debate when members were told to clear the building. An enormous crystal chandelier swayed precariously back and forth above the chamber, casting an odd light over the scurrying legislators.
2007 Milbrandt Vineyards "Traditions" Merlot, Columbia Valley, Wash. ($13-$16) - The color has muted ruby and sienna tones. The aroma has nice blueberry and lush red fruit in it. There is also a nice hint of wood aging. This is really good Merlot juice. It has all the power and lushness of Merlot with enough structure to restrain it and make it super duper! A really good New World Merlot. 90 points.
A. When Chubby Checker, the guy who made the Twist a global dance fad, sang "Start a little movement in your sacroiliac," he was talking about the joints -- yes, you have two -- on either side of the bottom of your spine. They're connected by some major ligaments and muscles to your lower back, buttocks, pelvis and pretty much everything that moves when you do. Your sacroiliac joints bear much of the weight of your upper body and act as shock absorbers when you move. They let you wiggle when you walk.
But parents of young children know how hard it can be to get them to taste something they suspect might be "healthy." To find guidance on that front -- and on the importance of the choices you make when feeding your children -- check out a paperback called "Lunch Lessons: Changing the Way We Feed Our Children," by Ann Cooper and Lisa M. Holmes, with a foreword by Dr. Mehmet Oz (Collins, $14.95).
The aesthetics of modern hearing aids have improved dramatically, too. Gone are the days when makers attempted to hide the devices within clunky eyeglasses or flesh-toned plastic. Digital technology allows designers to make hearing aids whose looks range from stylish to virtually invisible, he said.
Other companies struggled, and the guys in the corner offices shared the pain. Total pay fell 87 percent for Energizer's Ward Klein, 85 percent for Furniture Brands' Ralph Scozzafava and 51 percent for Solutia's Jeffry Quinn, all of whom went without bonuses last year.

In the Dec. 19 edition, there was an article on two men in St. Charles Hills arrested for manufacturing meth in their home. They both have previous, very serious charges, including (a charge of) child molesting (against one of them). My question is, why were they running around loose to be able to even produce meth? They should have already been locked up.

In the other case, James L. Griesbaum, 33, of Aviston, was charged with being under the influence of alcohol when his pickup swerved across the center line of Illinois Route 160 south of Highland on Feb. 16 and collided head-on with another pickup. The driver of the second pickup, Barbara K. Green, 56, of Trenton, was killed and a passenger in that vehicle, Ressie M. Woodcock, 81, of Trenton, was severely injured. Griesbaum could get up to 14 years in prison if convicted.
A Brazilian tax lawyer among us nearly keels over during the climb, stopping to sway sickly and clutch his chest. Glad for the excuse to stop, we offer him water, a walking stick, a candy bar. Our small wiry Colombian guide, who at age 56 has done the hike well over a hundred times, grabs the Brazilian's backpack, and wearing that and his own, trots up the trail like a mountain goat.

Two weeks before the House vote, the Congressional Budget Office released its estimate of Obama's budget, including its health care program. From 2011 to 2020, the cumulative deficit is almost $10 trillion. Adding 2009 and 2010, the total rises to $12.7 trillion. In 2020, the projected annual deficit is $1.25 trillion, equal to 5.6 percent of the economy (gross domestic product). That assumes economic recovery, with unemployment at 5 percent. Spending is almost 30 percent higher than taxes. Total debt held by the public rises from 40 percent of GDP in 2008 to 90 percent in 2020, close to its post-World War II peak.

The album's very name is an anachronism -- it dates back to 1930s books that held multiple 78s in sleeves, and so resembled photo albums. And its form has mutated over the years in reaction to new technologies: The album settled down for a while at around 45 minutes and two sides of a vinyl LP, then bulked up (often to bloated proportions) in the 1990s because of the longer running time afforded by CDs. Now, in the digital age, storage capacity no longer matters -- any limits on an album's length are arbitrary.

"Going to the Final Four with a team that many people said we weren't good enough, weren't strong enough, weren't mentally tough enough, and still being able to get to the Final Four with all the ups and downs we had, I think that was tremendous for this basketball team," Sullinger said, flanked by his parents and coach Thad Matta. "Once we got to the Final Four, we were trying to win it. But unfortunately, we fell short. I feel at peace with the decision I'm making."
If investors lose confidence in France, the next president may have to take tougher action, fast, replicating moves by governments in Greece, Spain and Italy, which have recently slashed wages and state-funded safety nets.

A connoisseur of moral ambiguity, Banks sets "Lost Memory of Skin" in fictional Calusa County, in South Florida. It tells the story of the Kid, a convicted sex offender living under a causeway with others of his ilk. Abandoned by his father, addicted to Internet pornography since age 10, he was raised by a neglectful mother so stereotyped I winced every time she appeared. In many ways, the Kid remains an innocent.
"1906 Earthquake," despite its title, teaches us that the fire that followed the quake wreaked as much or more havoc as the seismic event itself. Views that show the city after the smoke finally cleared bring to mind the photo-journalistic record of events such as the destruction of Hiroshima or the carpet-bombing of German cities at the end of World War II.

"It's very much a workplace," says Nicholas McCarthy, a screenwriter and director whose first film, "The Pact," was written at Kaldi and screened at the Sundance Film Festival in January. "I'll be working away and I'll get tired and notice there's somebody else tapping away at a laptop a few feet from me. I might know this person, but maybe not. It doesn't matter; I know what they're going through, and there's a bond."

We should get ready to retire 50% of today's coal plants and put wind, solar, geothermal and biomass power at the center of our electricity supply system. In 25 years, the U.S. should have a "renewable electron economy," with 70% of its electricity from renewables. Big solar plants built with heat storage could handle much of the summer peak demand. Geothermal plants would run around the clock, displacing large amounts of coal power. And when the wind blows, we would conserve fossil fuels. All of the renewables will be working together, integrated in a widely cross-linked grid that combines large and small generators and overcomes the weaknesses of green technologies.

Of course, a bankruptcy judge, acting in an apolitical environment, would have had to determine whether GM could emerge from Chapter 11 as a going concern. That determination might have necessitated different concessions from different stakeholders. For example, the United Auto Workers union might have had to accept real pay cuts (not just revamped work rules) and the secured bondholders might not have been strong-armed into taking pennies on their investment dollars. And, certainly, taxpayer resources would not have been tapped. Sure, there would have been plant closures, dealership terminations and jobs losses, just as there are under the current nationalization plan.

In Bell's play, Prospero (Monica Parks, elegant and scheming) owns the Casa Loma ballroom right around the corner. He (Parks plays a man) and his daughter, Miranda, have been exiled from their kingdom by his usurping brother, Alonso (Mary Logan). Prospero magically creates a tornado on the Mississippi, which is generally called "the Mississip." (Bell pays shrewd homage to verse drama.) Alonso, his son Ferdinand and others in their party are nearly killed, only to wash up onto the shores of Cherokee Street, where Prospero rules.

People don't give up on reality shows right away. Fans of a particular format know that it can vary in entertainment value based on the contestants, so if they've been watching a show for (in the case of Idol) nine seasons, they don't stop watching in the tenth season just because that season isn't good. That's how Survivor has weathered weak seasons: it has them, but it doesn't have several of them in a row. So you can't really tell whether a particular season is beloved based on whether the audience immediately abandons it.
What: This show merits prolonged study, with paintings ranging from lighthearted on the surface to deep undercurrents of emotional complexity.

Awaiting the inevitable -- the eventual collapse of the current system under the weight of national debt, an economy choked by government size and regulatory hyperactivity, and taxpayers who will someday call a halt to the looting of their bank accounts by "public servants" -- remains an option, of course.

Her daughter begged for the dresser to go to her room, “but I said no way,” Tammy says. Instead, it sits in her bedroom, where she has carefully arranged a tableau of two lamps, a porcelain unicorn statue, a clock and a fabric throw on its top.

She said the couple was drawn to the area by getting more for their money than in New York City in both space and value, something that other clients have emulated.
Seton Hall offense: Yes, Louisville is a good defensive team, but the Pirates aren't a bad offensive team, either. Where Seton Hall made the mistake, was not going at Dieng earlier in the game to try and draw a few fouls. He didn't commit a foul until 40 seconds into the second half and then not again until the 8:26 mark in the game. Can't let a dominant big guy like that just roam free for that long.

The drama of their growing, deepening friendship is alternately heart-warming and blood-chilling – and while director Matt Reeves doesn’t add a truly new interpretation to the tale, he preserves its odd, creepy sense of hidden pleasures and secret pains. (And – an added smile for classic horror fans – this is the first movie from Hammer in more than 30 years.)

The agreement is a milestone for Scenic Rivers Land Trust — not just because a property that could have been subdivided for several homes for people will remain home to wildlife.
Does that matter? Certainly. Perea has introduced legislation increasing the criminal penalties on registered sex offenders for residing in state-licensed facilities — even though there is no evidence of a problem with sex offenders at such facilities. It has nothing to do with child abuse or with the death of Seth Ireland, but it does respond to the headlines spurred by his request for an audit. The public demanded that someone "do something." Perea did something.
“Sometimes it’s good to be booed,” Jeter said. “Because you know people have an opinion about you one way or another. It beats being ignored.”
His Republican challenger, John Kasich, is a former congressman from suburban Columbus given to Reagan-style optimism and bold, sometimes questionable, ideas.

"I rode 250 miles while listening to 12 hours of tapes to prepare for a case I was working on," says Wolff, who at age 57, is fit and trim. "I'd come in from my rides and remember certain things I'd heard during the (recorded) lecture and would work it into my case. I thought this would be a great way to learn, because it IS a great way to learn. When you're on a bike, all you have to focus on are the lectures coming in over the loud speakers."

To a certain extent, we wish Obama were the villain that Romney and the NRA make him out to be. We have no interest in preventing law-abiding citizens from defending themselves, but we do think society would be safer with more laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals or to ban certain classes of military weapons from civilian use. Unfortunately, though, the president that Republicans portray as a wolf in sheep's clothing is really just a sheep. If the NRA persists in crying wolf despite this obvious fact, it's because gun owners might become complacent if they realized the battle against gun control has been largely won — which might prompt them to stop sending money to the NRA.
Just for a change, however, it would have been nice if there was something in this collective bargaining agreement that was just for the GMs. It would read like this: Spend what you must, but if you’re wrong more than once or twice, and screw up your team’s cap, you should lose your job.

"Grimm," on NBC, is mostly a horror show, in which a Portland, Ore., detective tracks down and vanquishes a beast of the week.

And this is how the Bible is made and remade in culture, again and again. Which perhaps means that the Bible is not only a sacred text of literature but also its sacred inter-text, not only a "book of books" but a book in books.
A. "My first job was in the military, which can either be a positive experience for leadership or teach you what not to do. However, working in the hospital as a respiratory therapist gave insight into what really takes place. Each step of the way, the diversity of the experiences helps you. It all helps to mold who you are and how to manage. Diversity of experience affords the perspective to help more people."
The Cardinals missed another mild chance in the eighth.
The Skinny: Louisville came into the tournament off a surprising run to the Big East tournament title and continued its winning ways.

That year ended with a 64-52 loss in the Midwest Regional finals to the Spartans.

This is not to say that Willingham has suddenly become a better hitter than Pujols, only that free agents can react unpredictably to new surroundings and new versions of pressure, and that it looks as if the Twins chose wisely when they made one of the quieter signings of the winter.
A key gauge of home prices in the nation's largest cities fell to a new post-crisis low in January, the latest sign that housing remains weak.
What's a party endorsement worth? Not as much as it used to. Gov. Corbett and the Republican Party failed to deliver the U.S. Senate nomination to their endorsed candidate, Steve Welch, showing once again that endorsements often mean little in modern statewide politics. This is a lesson state Democrats, too, have painfully learned over and over. In modern politics, with self-financed candidates, sophisticated media campaigns, and 24-hour news coverage, endorsements only matter if they bring significant financial and organizational resources. Increasingly, state parties lack the heft to back up their candidate choices. In the future, party endorsements will play much less of an important role.

Santorum, of course, is not in that box in three districts, so theoretically, he starts off with a nine-delegate deficit (three districts, with three delegates for each). That’s not counting his potential problems in other parts of the state, including the Akron area, where he can only qualify for some but not all three of the district delegates. If Santorum gets the most votes in those districts anyway, look for him to appeal to the Republican Party to follow the will of the voters and award the full roster of delegates anyway.
There are several competitors offering "insulated, waterproof, cold weather footwear at premium price points," Korkers chief executive Sean Beers said. Some sell strap-on devices for less than $50 that offer ice-gripping traction. Even Korkers sells that.

"If I was a cat, I would love to live here," Jane Little said.
Another way to save money is by avoiding the supermarket all together. Online food shopping is gaining popularity in New Jersey. It's been offered for years by Peapod (Stop & Shop), ShopRite and A&P, and now Long Island City-based giant FreshDirect has expanded its service into the Garden State, mostly in Essex, Hudson, Union and Bergen counties. It's not a free service -- FreshDirect charges $6.79 for delivery on a minimum $30 order -- but it does limit impulse buys and frees up the time you would normally have spent hunting for a parking spot or standing in line. FreshDirect is quite competitive price-wise. From artisan cheese selections to fresh-cut meats and just-caught seafood, "shopping the shelves" here can still make some foodies feel like kids in a candy store.

Donald A. Yatkeman died Feb. 11, 2012, at his home in Richmond Heights. He was 73 and was diagnosed in September with pancreatic cancer, his family said Tuesday.
Like brakes on a car, the role of tumor suppressor genes is to slow and even stop abnormal cells from dividing. When left unchecked, the fast division of these defective cells leads to cancer. Mutations (abnormal DNA) in special genes that prevent tumors from developing (tumor suppressor genes) remove one tool of the body's defense to cancer. Finding the culprit attacking the tumor suppressor genes is an important way to identify how cancer is brought on and how it can be treated.
"For my voice to be heard, I have to make a large public statement," he said. "I don't know the particulars of the job, but I know it's a high-expense, low-paying job."

Major banks temporarily put foreclosures on hold after the problems surfaced in the fall of 2010. Some had to refile previously filed foreclosure cases and revisit pending cases to prevent errors. Those delays and uncertainty over state and federal probes into the industry's foreclosure practices led to a sharp slowdown in foreclosure activity last year.
"The President and the Assassin" alternates chapters between policies drawn up in Washington and plots drawn up by anarchists. The Washington chapters prove to be more interesting, in large part because of the many parallels with today's national news - income inequality, foreign wars against shadowy insurgents, trade with China and so on.

Over the last 57 games, the pinball winger has 17 goals, 26 assists and a plus-14 rating. In a 4-1 victory over Columbus on Saturday, he scored his 18th goal and 48th point of the season, tying career highs he established in 2009-10. Despite going scoreless in Sunday's 2-1 win at Columbus, Oshie is closing in on 20 goals and 50 points, levels that separate an offensive threat from a defensive specialist. Numbers that qualify Oshie as a bit of both.
Obama has touted his gay rights record  that he has ended a policy that prohibited lesbians and gay men from serving openly in the military, and under his watch, the Department of Justice has refused to enforce the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as exclusively between a man and a woman.

From Ireland comes "Pentecost," a slapstick comedy that likens the Church to the church of soccer. The focus is on a priest who prepares his altar boys for the World Cup of Masses: the return of a local hero, now an archbishop, to his parish church. The priest addresses his soccer-mad altar boys as a coach might his players: "Now, go out and have the Mass of your life!" Will the youth who mistook a censer for a soccer ball be permitted to officiate? It may be a one-joke movie, but the joke is irreverent fun that stops just short of the sacrilegious.

Unfortunately for Californians who are eager for change, Fiorina has firmly staked out positions that are outside of the state's mainstream values and even its economic interest.

A tax on a tax. Coolidge would recognize that as wrong. The question is, when will Californians?

No lifeguards are on duty at Old Kona Airport State Recreation Area, but it's much closer to Kailua-Kona, with easy parking — the former runway — and the usual park and picnic facilities.

End zone: The Ravens ruled out starting wide receiver Lee Evans (left ankle) for Sunday. Evans did not practice this week, and he joins wide receiver David Reed (left shoulder strain) and rookie cornerback Jimmy Smith (high left ankle sprain) as three players who will sit out Sunday's game. Rookie Torrey Smith could make his first career start in Evans' place. … Despite missing three consecutive practices, starting left guard Ben Grubbs is listed as questionable. Grubbs did not play in Sunday's loss to the Tennessee Titans after straining ligaments in his toe. Cornerback Chris Carr, who was limited all week by a left hamstring injury, is also questionable. … Three starters in center Matt Birk (left knee), defensive end Cory Redding (toe) and nose tackle Terrence Cody are probable. Birk practiced fully for the second straight day, while Redding and Cody were limited for the second consecutive day. … For the Rams, running back Steven Jackson (strained left quad) is listed as questionable after practicing on a limited basis for the second straight day. Starting outside linebacker Ben Leber (groin) is questionable as are running back Carnell Williams (hamstring) and defensive end C.J. Ah You (wrist). … Starting wide receiver Danny Amendola (dislocated left elbow) is listed as doubtful even though he has not practiced this week. ... Tight end Michael Hoomanawanui (calf) and rookie wide receiver Greg Salas (ribs) are both probable. … Grubbs underwent an MRI on his injured toe Thursday, but results were negative, coach John Harbaugh said. "It's still sore," Grubbs said. "It's still a day-to-day thing. Every morning, I hope I wake up feeling a little bit better, but I guess because of the size of the joint, it takes forever for the swelling to go out. Right now, I think that's what's causing most of my pain, just the inflammation." … Rookie LaQuan Williams might return a few kicks Sunday, but it appears for now that Lardarius Webb will add kick returns to his plate that already includes starting at cornerback and returning punts. "Webby's in great shape, and he did it in the first game of the year, and we anticipate using him however we can use him throughout the game on defense and special teams," special teams coordinator Jerry Rosburg said during his weekly briefing Thursday.

After Kennedy's assassination, Johnson uses all his political guile to push the slain president's legislative program—the famous income-tax-cut package and the Civil Rights Act of 1964—through Congress.

To wrap himself in the Kennedy mantle, he makes certain that Jackie Kennedy, her dress stained with her husband's blood, is photographed next to him when he takes the oath of office on Nov. 22, 1963.

The legend gets the glory; the real person works. Morrison has a new novel out, "Home," a brief, poetic story of Frank Money, a traumatized Korean War veteran who returns to the states in the 1950s. Morrison has long used fiction as a private and alternative history, whether the Civil War ("Beloved"), the 1920s ("Jazz") or colonial times ("A Mercy"). With "Home," she wanted to add some truth — about war, about racism — to the standard '50s narrative.

Nasal and sinus problems — such as nasal polyps, allergies or sinusitis — can lead to a decrease in these senses. Dental issues, including an abscess, tooth decay or poor dental hygiene, may also interfere with your ability to taste and smell. Cigarette smoking is another common cause for a decrease in taste and smell.

The vibe: With the Asian-inspired architecture and lavish Japanese gardens embracing the building on its perch above Westside Road, it may be surprising to see the tasting room's flat-screen slideshow of chickens, tractors and such. The manicured grounds and expert hospitality speak of corporate management; it seems almost too polished to be a family operation.
