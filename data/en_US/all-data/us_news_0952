Teens frequently overcrowd their cars, cramming five or six into a cabin meant to seat four or five, Tsifrin said. Worse yet, the extra passengers often result in teens driving more aggressively. The NIH study found that when accompanied by male passengers in the front seat, teens of both genders speed more and leave shorter following distances; a quarter of the drivers in the study broke the speed limit by 15 mph or more. Researchers confirmed the same trend for teenage girls driving with other girls, but teenage boys drove less aggressively when girls rode up front.

"Miscommunication by our staff. That's our responsibility," Gottfried said. The Wolfpack had gone basket-for-basket with UNC in the first half.

øValidating vampires: With Twilight, True Blood and The Vampire Diaries fueling bloodthirsty fans these days, did this group pause before diving into the crowded genre? "We didn't really talk about that because Dark Shadows really predates all of that stuff," said screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith. "We didn't worry about well, where do we fit in the vampire universe of today? We wanted to just be true to the show and different." Pfeiffer thinks the nocturnal market is far from saturated. "I don't think people can get enough of vampires and werewolves," Pfeiffer said.

However, he confused his place in college football and in the university.

The NCAA's licensing arm likely wanted an exorbitant amount of money from the publishers to produce a video game version of their product. For EA, it makes sense to pony up for the college football license because "NCAA Football" sells well to the football fans that pack 100,000-seat stadiums.

Why is the city doing this? Finances and environmental concerns are factors. It's cheaper to compost than dump garbage. Diverting food waste from landfills to composting facilities reduces carbon emissions. And the end product can be reused -- and resold -- as fertilizer.

I had mixed feelings about the Italian wedding soup. One night, the textures of the pasta pearls and celery were cooked to the limit. On another night, it seemed freshly prepared.

Wendell Maxey: Dre Day: That's the anthem when Andre Miller flashes one of his old man moves, throws a lob, or backs down another guard on the block. Despite a rocky relationship between Miller and the Blazers since arriving in Portland, this past season eliminated such dramatics as Miller solidified his point guard role and added to the growth of LaMarcus Aldridge's game one lob dunk at a time. And when Nate McMillan needed a calming presence to settle down the Blazers offense, Miller was the man. There's also something settling about knowing Miller will get you 14 points and 7 assists on the regular. Forget his age. Forget the spotty shot selection and results from outside. Miller has been good for the Blazers and vice versa. If there is another point guard change coming it should come in finding a younger all-in-one back-up behind Miller, not replacing him. Around Portland, it's still Dre Day as far as I'm concerned.

On the roster: All five starters return on the offensive line for a third season together. That's good from a continuity standpoint, but the line was a little too inconsistent, especially in the run-blocking area last year. Jeff Backus, Dominic Raiola and Stephen Peterman are in their 30s and on the backside of their careers, and Backus had two major injuries in 2011, though he didn't miss a game. The Lions have done a poor job developing backup linemen over the years, though to be fair they've taken just one lineman (Gosder Cherilus) in the first two rounds of the last 10 drafts.

That amount goes down to $1 million if the Big East experiences a 25 percent decrease in total revenue from the prior fiscal year. It also goes down to $1 million if the Big East loses its status as an automatic qualifier in the lucrative Bowl Championship Series prior to July 2013. The exception is the general elimination of all automatic qualifiers.

The jurors heard some of that talk -- and saw FBI photos -- in some detail this afternoon.
Ventura said it was an "eye opener" to view baseball from the management side and has braced himself for more potential moves.
Aldean proves himself an astute student of country music history with that statement. The genre's ascendance in the last half of the last decade at the Grammys is an aberration, a statistical oddity based on the overwhelming crossover success of a handful of songs and artists who dominated pop music at the time of their wins.

That's because Batali and general manager David Rosoff, who held the same post at Campanile, Opaline and Michael's, are serious about wine. Rosoff has come up with a list of fifty wines under $50 from practically every region that makes wine in Italy. Most of them are pretty obscure, but you can order many by the quartino, i.e., quarter of a liter, or third of a regular bottle. Try the minerally Greco di Tufo from Benito Ferrara in Campania or the cool, focused Riesling from Laimburg in the Alto Adige. In reds, you might introduce yourself to Refosco from Friuli or the Nerojbleo from Gulfi in Sicily.
Now, instead of spending two or more hours commuting daily in his red Volkswagen Beetle, Mr. Kelly, 56, hops on the Patco high-speed train line and gets to his Philadelphia law-firm job across the Delaware River in about a half-hour. "It's just a much more enjoyable life," he says.

By the time Giants general manager Jerry Reese stood in front of reporters this afternoon and stated that he didn’t want to get into a “he said/she said situation” over what exactly happened before receiver Steve Smith signed with the Philadelphia Eagles on Wednesday, it was far too late.
The Gilt Club, located in Old Town, wasn't an obvious choice for the scene. As Dunn tells it, director Jonathan Krisel wanted a list of diners to look at as possible locations for the sketch. But the location scout threw the Gilt Club into the mix, even though it's not a diner. And "the director chose us," Dunn says.
In 2000, the bank introduced its Community Scholarship Program pledging $1.3 million toward scholarships to be awarded during the next 30 years to local graduating seniors. The Greater Edwardsville Area Community Foundation, which is governed by a board of local residents, administers the program with a selection committee who interviews the finalists.

He can’t ever win and he won’t ever finish — but maybe it isn’t about that. Maybe it’s about small victories and big messages. It’s about a fifth-grade student. It’s about the passing drivers who honk their horn, shout a word of encouragement and think twice before tossing debris out the window.
It is true that the two signature laws have some things in common. Both were negotiated mostly through backroom talks, which alienated those left out and confused the president's supporters. Both deals carry price tags that are hard for the average voter to fathom. Both will be debated for the next two years, as health care meanders its way to the Supreme Court and taxes continue to roil both parties through the presidential election of 2012. And both have been the subject of sensationalist and distorted politics.

For the rest of the turkey: Remove the wishbone. Using poultry shears or a cleaver, cut out the backbone by cutting through the ribs on either side. Save the backbone for the gravy; refrigerate with the rest of the trimmings. Cover and refrigerate turkey breast until ready to use.
We need a different approach, and there are plenty of ideas from across the political spectrum to choose from. We could scrap our bloated, loophole-ridden tax code in favor of one that is simpler and fairer to those without pricey lobbyists. We could create an immigration system that recognizes our need to attract and retain the world's best talent. We could make new investments in education and worker training to maintain our economic competitiveness. We could reform our entitlement programs so that we maintain a social safety net without bankrupting the country.
"There's sensitivity around the league right now, about any player that contacts the head," Backes said after Game 2. "And there's a little history between the teams, with contact to the head.
The other gay man is Roy Cohn (Larry Yando), a historical figure (or "footnote" as he describes himself). One of the more odious ultra-conversative opportunists from the McCarthy period through the age of Reagan, he saw to it that Ethel Rosenberg was put to death as a spy, and he remained a ferociously closeted homosexual to his dying day.
A plant in Nanjing makes the Fiesta, Mazda 2 and Mazda 3.
Despite the picturesque subject, though, and amiable tone, "The Highest Pass" isn't all that cinematically contemplative, opting too often for repetitive testimonials about everyone's feelings about letting go, and rote documentary editing rhythms, when uninterrupted, unnarrated cinematography of such an incredible landscape would just as assuredly signal the allure of so unusual a journey.
Johnson played middle linebacker the last two years for the Wolfpack, and also has experience on the outside. Most analysts project him to play in the middle in the NFL. He would presumably back up Browns middle linebacker D'Qwell Jackson, one of the team's premier players. Jackson did miss the last 10 games of the 2009 season and all of the 2010 campaign with pectoral injuries, before bouncing back with a healthy and strong season in 2011.

Dual CEO-chairmanships, in place at almost two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies, are a favorite target of activist shareholders. ISS, a proxy advisory firm that tracks proposals at all U.S. public companies, said the issue was on the ballot of some three dozen companies both in 2009 and 2010. Shareholders voted to divide the jobs at about a third of those companies.

You’ve got to feel sorry for all the other gadgets — and even industries — they’re obliterating with their do-it-all wizardry. Along the way toward becoming a must-have device for nearly half of Americans, smart phones are consigning an eclectic mix of technological gadgets and everyday tools to the dustbin of history.

"Frankly, I'm a little bit scared," said Debby Kolibaba, a teacher at Bilquist Elementary, also in Milwaukie, who may see 34 students in her classroom when kindergarten starts Thursday. "Are they going to be able to learn? Are we going to keep them calm enough so they have a good learning experience?"
As the team continues to try to wrestle away the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs along with the No. 1 overall seed in the playoffs, collecting victories in any matter is vital. The team left Los Angeles on Wednesday tied for the best record in the NBA ahead of today's matchup with the Suns in Phoenix, where they haven't won in 10 years.
Maybe it was impetuous of me to hand that money over to the young woman in Soweto. Possibly it was imprudent to slip on the harness and ride the caged industrial elevator to the top of that mural-covered utility-tower-turned-bungee-venue. Certainly it was unsettling to stand on the ledge, wind whistling in my ears and the township sprawling 300 feet below.
For dining, there's Council Oak, the de rigueur steakhouse; Blue Plate, a sleek diner-style restaurant with moderate prices; a food court; and, naturally, a Hard Rock Cafe. There's also poolside dining at the Beach Club.
Honoree: The Laguna Woods Historical Society will honor Barbara Leeper, its second-quarter honoree for 2012, on Wednesday at Clubhouse 7. A reception is at 9:30 a.m. with the ceremony at 10 a.m. The 19-year resident is involved in many clubs and is the president of the Aliso Club.
“If we’re successful here, it’ll be pretty clear that when attacked you have to respond and you can’t let charges go unanswered,” Romney said after visiting campaign volunteers at a Tampa phone bank. “I needed to make sure that instead of being outgunned in terms of attacks that I responded aggressively. I think I have and hopefully that will serve me well here.”
Other aspects of the report were mixed. Order backlogs are still growing, but at a much slower rate. The survey's employment index dipped, although February's pace was the fastest in 38 years.

Now, Sprengle is thinking of scaling back the goal to 50. Another hurdle is how to get them to Haiti. Her dad, a barge captain in Florida, offered to ship them on a barge bound for Haiti in late April. But how to get them from Oregon to Florida?
It’s a reminder that the word “Mediterranean” at this venue is not just a catch-all for Italian, with perhaps another nearby country’s specialty or two thrown into the mix.
"I have been trying to negotiate a yearlong extension with Republicans for weeks, and I am happy to continue doing so as soon as the House of Representatives passes the bipartisan compromise to protect middle-class families, but not before then," said Senate Majority leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.
"The (pension) system is dishonest," Emanuel said. "I think people in general feel that those of us in leadership positions have been gaming the system on our own behalf. They feel like there are two sets of rules: one for them, and one for those in a position of power."
But for most home buyers, mortgage rates are a key determinant of their total costs. Rates are so low now that houses in many markets look like bargains, even if price/rent ratios aren't hitting new lows. The 30-year mortgage rate rose to 4.12% this week from a record low of 3.94% last week, Freddie Mac said Thursday. (The rates assume 0.8% in prepaid interest, or "points.") The latest rate is still less than half the average since 1971.
Anonymous notwithstanding, the Karma is an eyeful, a lurid showpiece of a car, fast-backed and hip-high, a shank of turbulence pinched from the air. Nearly as long (196.8 inches) as a 7-series BMW and nearly as low (52.4 inches) as a Porsche 911, the four-seat coupe-like Karma hunkers down on heroic 22-inch wheels and tires, the biggest for any production luxury car, says Fisker. Getting these massive rims to ride and corner comfortably—which they do quite well, thank you—must have been miserable for the chassis guys, particularly since the Karma does not use an adaptive magnetic suspension system, just straight SLA independent with coilovers. It helps that the aluminum space frame is so stout, 34,000 Nm/degree of torsional stiffness.
Q. When traveling west on St Peters Road North, and approaching Kisker Road, there are "Bump" signs. As you cross Kisker, the outer road makes a sharp drop and then goes back up hill. Why would you put such a drop in the road? If it has been raining, there is a good chance you will also encounter standing water, because the drains are higher than the lowest portion of the dip. This is not a temporary road. This appears to be the finished product. How on earth could they have designed this so poorly? Do they intend to tear it up and make it right, when the new highway opens and takes the current traffic?
Sprouted-grain breads may not have much of an edge over other whole-grain breads, but both are more healthful than white, refined-flour breads, Frechman says. In the 1990s and 2000s, several large-scale studies showed that people who ate more whole grains lowered their risk of coronary heart disease by 20% to 40%. White breads are often enriched with iron and B vitamins that are lost when the bran and germ are removed from the wheat kernel during processing. And processed white flour is usually fortified with folic acid, resulting in higher levels of the B vitamin in white bread. But only whole-grain products contain the complete array of antioxidants and phytonutrients -- as well as lots of fiber -- present in whole-wheat kernels.
Recycle Sam was unable to attend Tuesday's Watershed Task Force meeting but will be honored April 21 at the Earth Day Festival. His mother, Konnie Voris, provided a sheet describing how Sam began collecting bottles and cans five years ago and his grandfather would help him cash in the collection. His father opened a bank account in his name so he can save for college.

Yes, there are still inquiries to be conducted, with responses analyzed and conditions picked apart.
But in many other ways, the work of this Cleveland native plays off the common conventions of traditional family snapshots. She often uses her suburban home in Fairview Park as a backdrop and her 10-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, as a subject.
Cerf’s disagreement with Rice is possibly the most damaging.
White supremacist and border vigilante J.T. Ready was already the subject of a federal domestic-terrorism investigation when authorities say he apparently went on a murder rampage in which he killed four people.

Returns from all 1,774 precincts showed both Romney with 24.55 percent support and Santorum with 24.54 percent. Texas Rep. Ron Paul drew 21.5 percent of the votes.
More common than sex-trade abuses have been reports of shabby housing, scarce work hours and paltry pay, alleged conditions that led workers to protest last year at a candy factory that packs Hershey chocolates in Hershey, Pa. Those workers complained of hard physical labor and pay deductions for rent that often left them with little money. The company that sponsored those students lost its State Department certification.

The worries are concentrated in Spain and Italy, and it showed up in their financial markets Friday. Spain's main stock index fell 3.6 percent and is now down 15 percent for the year. The yield on its 10-year government bond rose to 5.93 percent, and Italy's rose to 5.52 percent. That's a sign that investors' confidence in those countries' finances slipped. It also means those countries will have to pay more to borrow money.
The Humane Society today accused a Wyoming pig farm owned by a Denver-based company of cruelty to animals.
And it's paying off.
Compare that with Congress, where according to the Congressional Research Service, beneficiaries in 2006 took home pensions averaging about $36,000 or $61,000, depending on the plan. And active members, of course, also will get pensions.

Ciarelli, a 6-foot 6-inch outside hitter from Huntington Beach, leads the nation in aces at 0.60 a game. He is fourth in kills (.403).
Alfred toils at his job, loving fish but serving more as a bureaucratic functionary. But when Patricia Maxwell (Kristin Scott Thomas, also outstanding), the press secretary for the British prime minister, gets wind of Sheik Muhammed's desire to turn the desert of Yemen into a fishing paradise -- the PM is a lover of salmon fishing and sees a nice East-meets-West potential -- she sees the political upside: More than 2 million voters like fishing.
Trevor received a bone marrow transplant four days ago to battle AML leukemia. He was one of at least 60 children on the oncology and hematology ward at Children's Hospital of Orange County on Tuesday who got Joy Jars from Sandeno and her former teammate, Olympic gold medalist Jason Lezak. Three other swimmers, Chloe Sutton, Chad La Tourette and Ashley Twichell from Team USA, also met with the children.
Jordan Zimmermann (1-2) gave up four runs, three earned, in 6 1-3 innings for Washington, which has scored only seven runs during its skid.
3. The Lakers ball movement needs to still flourish. The Lakers so far have proved their size far outmatches the Nuggets' speed. But they've done so through constant ball movement. The Lakers have struck an incredible balance in ensuring Bryant's scoring, Andrew Bynum's inside dominance and Pau Gasol's facilitating by spacing the floor and hitting the open man. And they've done so without committing too many turnovers (10.5). If the Nuggets continue to go with a smaller lineup, the Lakers can still counter by staying methodical.
The Blackhawks rookie had just experienced arguably the biggest win of his young career, but he had to celebrate it in the locker room after being ejected for the most controversial play thus far in an increasingly testy first-round playoff series with the Phoenix Coyotes.

Arizona Department of Water Resources and Tempe officials were expected to inspect the damage Tuesday and determine a plan to investigate the rupture.
In a striking departure, Romney narrowly led Santorum among voters as the candidate who "best understands the problems of average Americans," a category in which the wealthy Romney has struggled this year.
That's a favor all couples owe each other, but it's an essential one for someone with an unsupportive family, health issues, money issues, and just one year left in the protective custody of an institution of higher learning. These next few years have the power to decide whether he gets stuck in the muck of his family or pulls himself out, hand-over-hand, using whatever branch or root he can grab.
I don't know if you are interested, but I have a very similar situation. Except instead of an apology, I owe a stranger a "Thank-you" – a very, very big one.
In the state capital, about 25 people protested in front of the governor's mansion on Tuesday. The group fell silent a couple of minutes before the scheduled execution time, and about 10 minutes later, they formed a circle to pray.

"I think the lockout is stupid," UP sophomore Alex Kenefick said. "I don't know what else to say about that. But I'm super stoked about this game. There's no NBA, so this is the best we can do."
That said, Holliday also ran into some bad luck early on. Holliday's current batting average on balls in play is .243, which is by far the lowest mark of his career. He's never been lower than .333 in a season in BA in balls in play. So when you hear Cardinals manager Mike Matheny saying that Holliday has hit the ball hard, but right at fielders, he's speaking the truth. Holliday's .243 BABIP will almost certainly rise. Among qualifying MLB hitters, Holliday ranks 152nd in batting average in balls in play. The extreme dip is encouraging in this regard: that .243 is likely to go up, and up, and up.

Jessica said the club meets regularly to come up with sayings to write on their bathroom notes, and they've posted them about five times, sometimes at other schools in the district.
There was a lot of talk about the Tigers' fifth starter in spring training, which was a pretty good sign this team is loaded. It felt like worrying about the microwave on your private jet.
So far, Schenirer and Mayor Kevin Johnson are the only elected officials at City Hall who have voiced their support of a homeless safe ground.
Masie also said his team plans to wear special “camo” jersey shirts in honor of American service men and women.
Days later, I hopped on a charter bus to visit Neruda's home in Valparaíso, a port town about two hours outside Santiago. The drive was spectacular, passing through the countryside and the many vineyards for which Chile is known. The air smelled sweetly of the fruit growing just a few feet from the road.
"No records were identified that indicate the existence of, or relate to, an 'Enemies List' as has been suggested by some to have been compiled by anyone in the office of the county executive or anyone in the police department," the letter states.

"Well, I guess I hope it's nothing about 'Hoosiers'," he said with an impatient twist of his face. "For us, I think we have proved already that we aren't a fluke, we aren't a Cinderella, we aren't those guys from 'Hoosiers'. What I hope people are saying now is that we're the Butler Bulldogs and we're pretty good."

A 26-year-old Philadelphia man suspected of impersonating a priest while visiting a wounded police officer was arrested on Monday. The man was charged with criminal trespass and false impersonating. Investigators said he posed as a Roman Catholic priest last month and entered a hospital's intensive care unit to visit Officer Richard Hayes.
Turns out that many people have opted for that convenience: In the 12 months ending in November, nearly 46 percent of the dollars going toward the purchase of coffee or espresso makers went to single-serve machines, according to NPD Group, a market research firm.
"The idea behind extreme couponing is to stockpile your groceries by using coupons when items are on sale so you never have to pay retail prices for your groceries again," she told The Jersey Journal.

11. D.C. United (10) - Charlie Davies makes news again, but this time it's his eighth goal - in the run of play, not a dive and penalty kick - tying him for the league lead.
Some parents say they are perplexed by what the new rules might allow.
If it sounds crazy, remember that in its infancy the draft was held at a hotel in Philadelphia, where less than half of the 81 players picked declined the opportunity to play in the league. This was long before Mel Kiper Jr.'s parents put a stopwatch and a tube of hair gel in his crib and let nature take its course. Kiper's was a different childhood, the first of its kind to include a self-timed puberty.
In the field, Heights picked up points from three javelin throwers. Senior Cody Trout led the way in third place at 146-10.5. Senior Taylor Siemsen finished fourth at 144-7, and junior Skyler Turner placed fifth at 144-5.75. Freshman Jack Nuss finished fourth in the high jump by clearing 5-6, eight inches short of the gold medal.

Once again, I was not involved in the solicitation, evaluation or selection of the winners of this procurement so I did not know which companies were competing in the bid process. The initial RFP was cancelled when the Department of Procurement conducted its initial review and found that 36 percent of the proposals would have been disqualified due to errors on the state-mandated E-verify form. I believe the Chief Procurement Officer’s decision to re-bid was the correct course of action because this process occurs once every 7-10 years, and we needed maximum competition. If approved by the Atlanta City Council, the recommendations will significantly increase competition as shown by the fact that the airport is projected to receive $23 million dollars more per year in additional revenue.

"Freethinkers," a great book by Susan Jacoby, explained that the modern use of the word Christian was pushed to fight Roe v. Wade.

Summers being what they are here in St. Louis, you don't have all day to do this. By 9 a.m. the heat will melt your face right off your skull the moment you walk out the door. Not wanting my kids to be little puddles of childhood on the sidewalk, we have to start early. Dragging them out of bed and into clothes is the easy part. Getting them to get on their shoes and actually keep them on is the challenge. They have shoes with the right action hero, the socks with the correct cartoon character, but that matters little. Begging and pleading rarely work, and duct tape wrapped around their little ankles draws the kind of attention I would rather just avoid. Speed and distraction sometimes work to get the third kid's shoes on before the first one is standing there with naked feet and wiggling his toes. There are times you wish they could still just ride in the stroller, but then we wouldn't need this walk in the first place. Oh the paradox that is child rearing.

The Wildcats are the best transition team in the country and also hold opponents to nation-best 37.5% shooting. Terrence Jones is a streaky player, but when he's playing well Kentucky is all but unbeatable. Davis, of course, is a shot-blocking fiend with his 7-foot-5 wingspan but has improved offensively during the course of the season. Louisville has trouble generating points but has won of late with a stingy 2-3 zone defense that likes to funnel traffic inside toward center Gorgui Dieng, who averages more than three blocks a game.

We see only one brewing acquisition likely that would be large enough to warrant a capital increase, and that is SABMiller."

But Harvard and MIT are not the only elite universities planning to offer an array of massively open online courses, or MOOCs, as they are known. This month, Stanford, Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Michigan announced their partnership with a new for-profit company, Coursera, with $16 million in venture capital. Meanwhile, Sebastian Thrun, the Stanford professor who made headlines last fall when 160,000 students signed up for his Artificial Intelligence course, has attracted more than 200,000 students to his new company, Udacity.

Laptop: When editing photos and videos and posting to a blog are priorities, the laptop comes along. I use a basic Apple MacBook ($999 minimum at the Apple Store), mostly because it handles photos and video better than a PC. Also, watching movies on the plane is just better on a laptop screen.

not have to be this way. Bonds and Clemens could have admitted to some form of drug use, asked for forgiveness and moved on. Remember, they were not indicted for using PEDs; they were indicted for allegedly lying about it. Ask Alex Rodriguez, Andy Pettitte and a host of others - the Official Steroid Confessional is now as much part of the game as the Official Baseball Rules. I know, I know - no two situations are analogous. A-Rod had nowhere to hide after Sports Illustrated revealed his steroid use. Pettitte was a much lesser name and more likable figure; fans wanted to forgive him. Yet, Bonds and Clemens are less sympathetic than even A-Rod, who often comes off as phony, but is more self-absorbed than anything else. From Bonds and Clemens, you get the same hubris, the same antagonism, the same aggressive sense of entitlement. No one in Clemens' camp even saw the indictment coming, a troubling sign on several levels."
Just hours after the House Armed Services Committee approved its $642 billion spending blueprint, Panetta and Army Gen.

Except the secret is out. Local tour operators all offer the same four daily itineraries -- known as A, B, C and D -- so the water, while stunning, was sometimes crowded. When everyone came back to town in the afternoon, they would watch the sunset, order a beer and promptly log on to Facebook at a cafe just feet from the surf. It felt as if the other tourists (and the Internet) were crashing my deserted-island fantasy.

The 10-college system had been required to charge the out-of-state tuition rate to undocumented students since Proposition 300 passed in 2006. But the community-college district didn't charge that rate to students who took six or fewer credits. That allowed undocumented students -- and anyone who was not a resident of Maricopa County -- to earn their degrees at a lower rate by taking one or two classes per semester. Undocumented students were able to pay a now-defunct "unclassified student" rate of $96 per credit hour, compared with $73 per credit at that time.

"Couture seems more relevant now than it was in the boom years," says designer Donatella Versace, who this season returned Atelier Versace to the official couture runway after eight years of low-key presentations.

The absorption of the gel is not as consistent a treatment as the oral pill, but will be effective if administered properly.

We won't be cutting back our roses here at the Missouri Botanical Garden anytime soon - probably not before early to mid-April. Traditionally, experienced rose growers often wait until the average last frost date (April 15 locally), or thereabout, before removing winter mulches and pruning in spring. As is the case in many years, and like your roses, our roses are also putting on a lot of premature growth, but we choose to go with the flow and wait until the appropriate time, then prune once and be done with it.

In contrast, supporters have raised about $1.75 million, much of it to collect signatures to put the proposition on the ballot, and had $123,000 cash on hand as of the last reporting period. Opponents have blasted the motives of several of those donors -- including a developer who contributed $400,000 after the Legislature exempted a proposed football stadium in the City of Industry from environmental laws.

øAnother fund to consider is the closed-end European Equity fund (EEA). The market price of a closed-end fund is typically less than the actual value of the securities it owns. The fund sells for an 8.1% discount now. In the unlikely event the fund were to liquidate - or become a garden-variety open-end fund - shareholders would get an immediate gain. Otherwise, you're buying European stocks at a discount, which never hurts in a market that could get cheaper.

Since the 1980s, it has been law in Ohio that vehicle registration expires on your birthday. But because license plate stickers merely reflect the month the plates are renewed in large enough type for another motorist to see, many drivers treat the entire month like a grace period, regardless of when their birthdays fall. The registrations are technically expired, but police wouldn't know that by looking at the tags from their cruisers.
That's because the Illinois Department of Natural Resources couldn't afford to hire a contractor to do the work quickly.
