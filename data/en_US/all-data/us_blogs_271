The other type of white women who favour black men, tend to be more glamorous, albeit glamorous in a somewhat over the top manner. One of my correspondents, who wrote to me a while ago, told me that, when she was young, there was an expression used to describe women who dressed in rather trashy and overstated / over painted manner, who were said to be “looking for a black man”. It is an interesting expression, and I don't think I can be accused of unfairness by suggesting that many of the white women who are more affectionately inclined towards man of races other than their own, do tend to favour an appearance which enable them to aspire to an image which would sit more comfortably within the lyrics of a gangsta rap number.
Why? Because I know him. And I know how he thinks.
So after all that was said and done, Gezol donned the famous Sabbat jockstrap, replete with dangly inverted cross. By now a good few people were leaving as it was coming up for 1am.

Break the fast that your body has experienced while sleeping with a breakfast that will encourage your body to burn fat not store it. That means avoiding all those over processed, high GI cereals out there that cause insulin levels to rise and your fat storing ability to increase and go for a far slower releasing, preferably wholegrain option instead. Ideally, you’ll add some protein too as this helps to increase satiety (feelings of fullness) for longer and will help to slow the rate of emptying from the stomach even further. Great options to go for include:

In the short time I’d been out Nirab had recruited Stupid Peter into his God cult. I tried to renounce Nirab and his fairy tales and tell Stupid Peter that Christ the Messiah was most likely a prototype EBE*, a forerunner of common man – now broke from the shackles of apeman impulses by being imbued with Space Genes, transforming us into the fast thinking, imaginative and above all compassionate specimens we are today…
This match was more of a rollercoaster before it began than it was once it began. Initially, it seemed we’d get Beth vs Nikki for the title and Kharma would come out to dominate. Then it seemed we’d get Kharma vs Nikki and Kharma would dominate. Then what we got was Nikki Bella defending against the returning Layla (though I initially thought it was Michelle McCool given the music)! I’m a huge fan of Layla, so I was in no way disappointed to see her return. Both she and the Bellas are very underrated wrestlers, and for the limited time they had, they put on a decent match (ring rust etc permitting for Layla). Some good, impressive moves from both women, but especially Layla, who was being showcased – including a crossbody from the top rope. This was all after some good, scientific focusing on Layla’s rehabbed knee from Nikki, but after Layla got control, they attempted Twin Magic. Usually, that spells the end, but Layla managed to simply beat Brie with her tough neckbreaker finisher for an emotional win. Yes, the fans were disappointed, but this was the right way to do things. This was an intense PPV, and a Kharma return wouldn’t have had as much impact, while her being mentioned and thought of as a generally terrifying prospect will only make her eventual return more impactful. Meanwhile, the belt is now back on a babyface that Kharma can terrorise when she returns, and hopefully, Layla will be able to have some impressive, Gail Kim style matches with her before Beth returns for the showdown! Oh yes, and come back soon, Bellas.

Saif al-Islam Gadhafi blamed the protests that erupted in eastern Libya last Monday on a variety of culprits, including Libyan exiles, Islamists, foreign media, and drug abusers. But, he conceded that Libyan security forces had made some "mistakes" in cracking down on demonstrators because of a lack of training in dealing with such situations. In a conciliatory move, the younger Gadhafi said the government is willing to begin a dialogue on political reforms, including a new constitution and confederate power structure.

This week I shall be mostly talking about names. I'm not sure if my new lead characters' name is fixed yet. I keep changing my mind which is not a good thing. I find that once I am completely sure about the name the character flows quite easily. People grow into their names, in fiction and in real life. So until I am sure I am a bit like a foal in the wind, skittish and unsettled.
Here’s the thing. If you are traveling as a duo or more, there is a rapport, an air of comfort, and it tends to be contagious. If you meet others on the road, there is a measure of control available. Even if they outnumber you, a willful coalition can steer the direction of banter. Generally speaking, these circumstances make the getting-to-know-you small talk a painless and quick process. It is almost as if the travelers’ knowledge of one another acts as a proxy for the knowledge of the stranger. You can move right past “where are you from,” and similar questions via the glib repartee your pre-established dynamic affords.

As I have pointed out many times, there is only one elected official in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government. That official – the President – then appoints each cabinet member and other bureaucracies that in turn appoint (hire) a full staff for themselves. Elect one person, and you are stuck with millions of appointed people.
Today's card was made using Quic Kutz Santa's Workshop set of dies. I got it at a swap a while ago and tucked it safely away... and rediscovered it during cleaning. The set includes a variety of circles and other shapes. The card included a flower made using some Sizzix flower dies, and a shape pre-stamped with make a wish from a swap , it will be used as an emergency card for the autumn season. I had premade the flower and sprayed it with Glimmer Mist Sunflower for a hint of a shimmer. The background cardstock has torn edges using Coordinations paper.

What I’m not fine with is my dumb ass continues to NOT take my fucking medicine and then I get a little crazy. Or at least I get a little crazier than normal. What I really hate is when I actually get depressed. Most of my “episodes” aren’t so much depression as anger which I kindly take out on the people I work with; I’m sure they love that. I’m sure they love that even more since they are technically working “for me” as in I’m the boss, bitch.
Let me take a step back for a moment to qualify my assertion that time is also relative to technology, in addition to mass and acceleration. Einstein’s theory is empirical, with a number of recorded experiments successfully indicating that time, as measured by atomic clocks, is altered by varying speeds and masses.

Revolutions and democracy are not easy. People who think you have a revolution one day and the next day you have democracy, stability and economic growth – no, that’s a joke. I think Syria is going to be in turmoil for the coming three to five years but at the same time I think that’s totally fine. We’ve been under the Assad regime for the past 41 years and under the Baaths since 1963 and it’s getting time to be able to get rid of them.

Now - here is the miracle. Wednesday night I came home from mutual to find all heck had broken loose. My dear sweet husband (who is now dear and sweet once more after a severe tongue lashing but his rather out of control wife) had not been properly attending our 5 little angels from heaven and an unfortunate accident had occured. I walked into the crime scent unaware of the catastrophe that awaited me and there at the bottom of my very large, very full bathtub was my $150.00 little birthday gift laying still and motionless in it's watery grave. I am ashamed to talk of what happened next but let's just say - I could have been committed (to a insane asylum that is).
When looking for a mobility device (walker, wheelchair, power chair or scooter) here are some things to consider:
After having several children, some of whom are very difficult in nature, I see things differently. And after putting myself out there with this blog and being the subject of judgement from strangers, I REALLY see things differently. It's easy to judge someone else and decide that they're incompetent when things are going well for you. When I'm out with the kids and they're all behaving like angels and we're smiling and having a good ole time, it would be easy to look at the mom who is ready to pull her hair out and is almost in tears as she half-runs to catch up with her 2 year old and half-drags her pouting 4 year old behind her. It's easy to look at them and think, "MY kids would never act like that in public. I know how to discipline them. What a shame."

Do you think acting like I don’t care about you will make me feel better? Do you think pretending to hate you that much is make me happy? I’m not happy. I love you, I always love you no matter what. That’s why I’m letting you go that easily. I have to deal with these scars and setting you free.
Still, though, I WAS pissed at the way Edwards and Obama were tag-teaming her. I was VERY pissed after Edward's supercilious comments about her tearing up, implying that she's not fit to govern because she showed the strain of the campaign for a second.

The internet and books. Here is a way that could be considered "teaching yourself." Looking up things you're interested in on the net, reading books on the subject... Yet even that isn't necessarily an all-by-yourself thing. Sometimes someone will read something out loud to me that they think I might be interested in. I regularly share article links and in turn have people send me links. I interact with people and learn from them on the internet quite often. I visit the library or a second-hand bookstore with family and friends, and we share the interesting books we find.
You’re there to listen when they need someone to talk to. Someone who can just listen if that is what they need, or give advice or sympathy if that is what they want.
"Also, in case you're interested, the twins, Nate and Will, will be turning 6 on Nov. 19th and Hunter will be 12 on Dec. 1. It would be wonderful if we could shower them with cards for their special day, just like their mom would do. Kevin's birthday is November 17."
Anyhoo, the point is cleaning and decluttering isn't always enough. Buyers have to be able to envision themselves in your home and not be thinking, "gee, their kids are slobs..."
Clamping shut,
There is only one solution to the water problem. That solution is to stop regarding the treatment and supply of water as something which can be left to the international market. Water is an essential utility, and the fact that its control is a means to enrich multi-nationals is nothing less than scandalous. People can do without electricity, but they cannot do without clean water. More than any other utility, it is vital that the water industry is returned to ownership by indigenous Britons, and is provided at a cost which is self-sustaining, and does not result in profit. Of course, any additional services beyond the supply of water and the maintenance of the system could reasonably be undertaken with an eye to making a reasonable profit, but the essentials must be regarded as life essentials, which is what they are. What we need to save our water system is, in a word, nationalisation.

Even more to the point (for it is understandable that extra precautions must be in place in Guatemala), in Ethiopia, adoptions have been cut in half because of increased fears of improprieties in the adoption process, even though no actual improprieties have been discovered. What this means is that people like me must wade through the slog of paperwork, while patiently enduring a two-year process which winds up costing about $40,000. Other countries are more difficult than Ethiopia.

Lisa swallowed and then sighed. She wanted to show her dad that she was no longer a vulnerable little girl. But at the same time she knew it would not be easy to avoid further awkward questioning if she didn’t tell the truth. At least telling her dad would give her the opportunity to get a few things off her chest.

Percy Jackson and the other demigod’s (may it be Greek or Roman) world would probably be the third most amazing place I want to live, since the first one is here on EARTH and the second one is in heaven.

From the revelation of his ancestry up to the last fight (in the series), I was glued on the contents of Riordan’s, well, the second series.

The teachings that are taught on planet earth around food and nutrition and exercise were taught to further contain and suppress an already downtrodden race. We guide for you to look inside and to notice which teachings you resonate with and ask if they serve? We ask for you to look at the smoke and mirrors around the nutrition of the human body and ask if you are in balance with SELF? Do you monitor what you put into the body and how it makes you feel or do bow down to the knowledge of another who claims superiority? Dear ones the master of your ship is YOU, no one else has the knowledge of YOU that YOU do, do you understand our guidance? Do you understand our meaning?
Because of my goal to not be induced, I wasn’t focusing much on my due date. I just figured he would be late, and that he would come when he was ready. I was hoping for an Easter baby, just because I thought that would be fun. I scheduled an appointment for a consultation with a surgeon in Seattle about my hernia for March 30th. That made my doctor a little upset- he told me he didn’t want me travelling that close to my due date. I thought he was just sore about my decision to see a surgeon in Seattle rather than a local one. We disagreed on several things relating to my hernia, but that isn’t really important.

Christmas is indeed the most wonderful time of the year. It's the only time when G takes over the kitchen and prepares Christmas lunch, leaving me in charge of desserts. It's relatively stress-free for me, although I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that my maiden attempt at baking a red velvet cake tomorrow will be successful. For now, I decided to make some marbled Coke eggs, which are actually hard-boiled eggs which have been simmered and steeped in a Coke and soy "broth" for a few hours. The marbled effect is created by cracking the shell of the hard-boiled eggs all over before simmering them in Coke. The eggs would have absorbed a mildly sweet flavour with a hint of soy, depending on how long the eggs are left in the Coke. These can be served warm or at room temperature, and are great for picnics, parties or just a snack for the kids at home. And they look quite pretty too!

Ola Dubh is a fantastic beer, and a fantastic range of beers (12,16,18,30,40yrs) from the ever impressive Harviestoun Brewery. If you've not heard of the beer before (I'm sure you have) it's Harviestoun's Old Engine Oil aged for some time in Highland Park Whisky casks (in different respectable ages) and basically translates as 'Black Oil'. This 8% beer pours intensely black in colour, with the most inviting of aromas consisting of; liquorice, roasted grain, oak, vanilla, dried fruit and a little chocolate. The flavours are thick, rich and moorish. More of the flavours really make a push forward in the body, with a little smokiness coming through on the sides of the tongue.
There were western women who I saw on my travels who wore shorts, vest tops and did not cover up their shoulders and legs. They had obviously not done any research about what was expected of them in these countries. Either that, or they chose to ignore it and stick two fingers up to the whole thing. Good on them I say… I showed respect on every visit to these countries and was still disrespected by the assholes that call themselves men!

Audition candidates should be female dancers between the ages of 16 – 22 years of age and 5’4” tall or under, with classical ballet training.

Audition candidates should be prepared to partner that day and to stay for Call Backs. Audition candidates should bring three copies of their headshots and three copies of their biographies to the audition.

Another interesting thing that I found in the Katha Upanishad is that, Nachiketas was the son of Yaajasrava, who was the son of Yajasrava, who was Gauthama’s son. And Nachiketas was the small boy who went and visited Mrutyu (Death), got 3 boons and one extra from him and learnt all about the Brahman (the great, absolute, formless God) and about a special Naciketas Fire for use in the Vedic Yajnas. Sri Krishna used some slokas from the Katha Upanishad in the Bhagavad Gita. So we know how important it is.

Months ago, I had met my friends for coffee, and as we laughed, a crumb took a wrong turn. I started to choke a little, then held up my hand, as if to say "Don't worry, I've got control of this." I coughed and coughed, a lot at first, and then just a little. But the bit o' muffin wouldn't quit bouncing around my windpipe. The coughing wouldn't stop.
Aromatherapy is defined as the therapeutic use of plant-derived, aromatic essential oils to promote physical and psychological well-being. This form of therapy has been documented since the era of ancient Egypt and was expanded upon by the Romans and Greeks. In fact, for 1500 years a text entitled “De Materia Medica” written solely on the medicinal value of aromatic botanicals by a Greek doctor/surgeon was the accepted reference book for Western Medicine. In modern times, it’s considered a part of Holistic medicine, which is an alternative to Western, ironically enough. In aromatherapy massage, essential oils are mixed with a carrier oil (something unscented to dilute the concentration of the essentials for use on the skin) and used on the client to address whatever issue they have come to their therapist for. The simplest choices on the aromatherapy menu tend to be a Lavender and/or Peppermint essential oil massage; the former to relax and undo stress and the latter to invigorate and refresh. Beyond these two, is a world of essential oil scents and combinations that a skilled aromatherapist can use to treat one’s state of mind and body.
We had one more trick up our sleeves. When we shot the painting, we boiled a kettle in front of the camera lens. It didn’t quite create the smoky industrial miasma we were looking for, but it did soften the shot a bit. My only regret was the schoolboy error I’d made in painting the building almost up to the edges of the card, which gave us limited framing options.

Naturally when the 7650 came out I bought one and the 7110 spent the rest of it’s days in a drawer until I lent it to a girlfriend. I have to say I’m somewhat annoyed to this day that I never got it back. The 7650 was really the device that triggered the whole idea of convergence and for all the talk of the iPhone’s revolutionary nature, it was in my view the 7650 that got the ball rolling. What was just as surprising as the phone itself were the uses people put it to. It had emerging technologies like Bluetooth and 3G, it offered convenience of a phone and camera in one. More importantly it had the Symbian series 60 OS, so the phone became a software platform you could install applications on either from your computer or wirelessly over the mobile network. I installed a number of them, all with varying degrees of success. Like apps that turn your iPhone into a torch simply by switching on the screen backlight, there was an application which turned your 7650 into a torch by… well you get the idea. There were also precursors to GPS, early attempts to use the cellular network to determine location. One application allowed you to save the network ID of the cell the phone was currently using. You could then set various actions when the phone next connected to that specific cell. For example you set the phone to go to silent mode or switch itself off (e.g. if you worked at a hospital). I used the alarm clock mode which rang when you entered certain network cells. As I travelled to work on the train, I set two alarms, one at my home station cell and one at my work station cell. No matter if the train was delayed or, even god forbid, early I could stay asleep until I reached my destination!

Johnny Cash has a famous song about the travails of a boy named Sue, and gossip columnists love to mock and condemn the absurd names celebrities give their offspring. It is certainly how to see how any kid could enjoy being called Apple or Trixibelle or Pilot Helikopter. But very common names can also be troublesome to their bearers. As a kid, I was asked with tiresome regularity whether I played the saxophone, and how well I could skate. I had the same name as a smooth-playing, cheesily moustachioed American jazz musician and a figure skater who had won gold on the Sarajevo ice at the 1984 Winter Olympics.

Shes such a little tomboy- much happier building things with wood or digging in the dirt, than playing dress up or with dolls. She passes the Barbie aisle at the store as if it doesn't exist.

To modern-day Leftists anybody they disagree with is a "fascist" so in their discourse the term is essentially devoid of meaning, but, aside from such childishness, it remains of interest to ask what other prominent Fascists there were in the 20th century? Were there other influential Leftists in the 20th century who were also nationalists and who might hence broadly be described as Fascists?

About 2 years after the ANC government took over the reins of power in South Africa in April 1994, they started exploring the possibility of replacing the old apartheid system of education with a new system called Outcome-Based Education (OBE). Many reasons were given why change was absolutely necessary, but in the end it all boiled down to the ‘reformation’ of South Africa’s underprivileged youth.

Guitarist Lenny Kaye's collection LP of US garage bands, Nuggets, released in 1972, helped to define punk. It showed that it was not all sweet Mersey pop in the 1960's. Full of snarling bands like The Standells and the 13th Floor Elevators, Nuggets became an underground success, and helped inform US groups of the early 70's such as The Stooges and The New York Dolls. British entrepeneur Malcolm McLaren briefly managed the latter group in 1975 and brought a lot of their ideas over to Britain. He and fellow travellers took this basic template, added the disafectation of British youth and launched punk into a largely complacent music scene that didn't know its Topographic Ocean from its Tubular Bell.
I have intruding thoughts of failure ALL the time. I am 2 damn classes away from my degree, yet I can't believe that I can possibly get it. WHY WHY WHY? Its like I am at war with myself constantly. Is this illness, is this insecurity, or is this imagined? When failure seems inevitable is it permissible to step down and wait until I am well? I don't even feel like I can ask for help. Who would I even ask if I could. This is just so damn hard. hard hard hard.

Charles Dickens perfectly described our weather when he wrote, "It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.” There have been times when I've forgotten that it's early spring and on chilly mornings like today, I'm reminded of it. But I'm not the only one enjoying the warming temperatures. I've seen the turtles sunning themselves on a log, and a snake (!!!) on its way somewhere that I hope is far away.

This post came about when I was realizing just how many things, events and online groups and other things, that I wanted to let my readers know about. And, well, once you have more than one or two, it seems pretty silly to give each one it's very own post! So here are some things I really think you should check out.
Drew, she was my favorite. I don't understand why the judges didn't save her. Or at least send it to a deadlock so the person with the lowest votes would go home. I would be sad if it turned out she had the lowest viewer votes and was sent home, but if I knew that then at least I would still be able to watch the show. I would be sad but think oh I guess people didn't realize they needed to vote for her, or maybe everyone else doesn't enjoy that unique tone to her voice as much as I do. And that would be that. But that isn't what happened. Of course Simon tried to save her, but the other three just tossed this shimmering sparkly girl aside. Ugh, I am so angry with the judges, and with the show, that I can't tolerate the idea of watching it anymore. I would like to support some of the other contestants, but whenever I think of the show I just feel sick. I can't stand the idea of watching and listening to those judges anymore.

Only the knowledge of God’s immeasurable and unceasing outpouring of mercy and love from the glorious pierced Heart of Jesus gives me the confidence to accept the great honor and burden which His Holiness intends to confer upon me.

Creative ICT can involve looking at different types of computer based art, graphics and photo editing packages. Pupils can try out a whole load of different types of software: some you might have installed at school (2Paint a Picture, Revelation Natural Art, to name a couple of common ones) and some that are web based (Bomomo, Brushster, SumoPaint etc.). Some that are mainly for photo editing and manipulation (Fotoflexer, Tuxpi etc.), photo collage applications (Andrea Mosaic, Shape Collage etc. ) and some that aren’t really art packages at all but have artistic merits (Wordle, PowerPoint, Textorizer etc.).

I took notably less shots with the X100 than the GRD. It’s the size and shiny metal that prevented me to get the candid shots. My only comfort is the LCD screen. It’s the not-so-pro method, by framing with the LCD can often guarantee me the candid shot.
Once I had this truth, I grabbed it and stowed it away and kept it on my belt. I had to take these trials now and these situations to see how God may be glorified through them. If it wasn’t glorifying to God, then get rid of it. Remove it far from me if it doesn’t bring God glory. I had now learned to pray a specific prayer to God. It went similar to this, “God, if this is a hindrance to your purpose and your will, and if it doesn’t bring you glory, remove it. Lord, bring things into my life that may be honoring to you. Bring things into my life that may be glorifying to you and pleasing to you. Lord may you be glorified among the nations and through me. Use me to bring you glory. Amen”

This gift brings me to the Zafu, brings me to the fellowship, and forces me to open my mouth and change my actions. It is not easy.

It's kept me from running way.
2) Buildings could project films upward onto the cloud canopy. For your next corporate party you hire SkyTV: a patented, cinematic approach to urban cloud cover. Drive-in cinemas would no longer exist; high-rises would, instead, have installed bleachers on their roofs, like those old tiered seats you find atop houses near Wrigley Field, put there so you can see the game without an official ticket. Only, here, those bleachers are tilted back like planetarium seats – and everyone is watching the sky.a) Even without shining films into the sky, this would be an amazing idea: turning the whole city into a planetarium. Perhaps astronomers should be asking: Why aren't there sky-bleachers on every roof? You're out on a date some night and you're invited to stop by a friend's party – but everyone seems to be heading up onto the roof. You both follow, drinks in hand – and soon you're out on the roofscape, nervous amidst bleachers, gigantic hulking silhouettes against the night sky. And there are dozens and dozens of people up there, reclined in near-silence, watching the constellations. There are thousands of buildings around the city like this, you're told. No one stays inside anymore.

"In most ESDC real estate projects, the land is owned by ESDC and leased to a developer. When land is owned by ESDC, that land is exempt from real property taxes," she said. "The exemption derives from ESDC ownership--it doesn't depend upon whether the land was acquired by eminent domain. If the land owned by FCRC simply was conveyed to ESDC (instead of condemned), that land similarly would become exempt from property taxes."

I'm also happy to see that WotC is clearly associating the game with D&D and is including more iconic D&D monsters in the game. I think that's a brilliant idea. It's also evidence, I think, that maybe, just maybe, there's actually a strategy in place to attract younger people to the hobby. Even if there's not, I'm still grateful that Dungeon! is coming out of mothballs for a new generation. Bravo, WotC! Keep the reprints coming.

The TV ad may have been misleading, but the Nutella label did not hide its ingredients or the fact that it contained palm oil, and tons of sugar. I can understand if the label did not make it clear that it had 20 grams of sugar per spoonful or serving. Unsuspecting people might have believed 20 grams was for the whole jar. On the other hand, I’m no expert on oils, but palm oil sounds recreational, if not healthy. Notwithstanding the deceptive ad, misreading is not the same as misleading.

The exact way of submission is given in religion. Different religions were sent to different groups of humanity, at different times – via prophets and messengers. Though the specific acts of worship differed, and rules and regulations also differed, the core principle was always the same: strict monotheism – believing in, and worshipping only One Creator – and nothing else.
In a world full of men eager to control women’s bodies, to make our sexual decisions for us or to score points with neofeminists by parroting anti-sex worker dogma, I’m glad there are a few who have enough respect for women that they’re willing to speak up for our right to agency and self-determination even at a time when it isn’t politically correct to do so. That takes guts and character, and I am of the opinion that those traits deserve recognition wherever they occur.

Popular Christianity emphasizes faith in connection with health, wealth, success and prosperity. Although now another extreme in the opposite direction seems to have captured the imagination and occupied the hearts of some. Jumping beyond these materialistic answers to faith, this text relates faith to worship and a right worship involves faith in Christ. Faith and worship go together. As the Introit says, "Adore God, all you His Angels."

I was just 17 and it was high summer. I had a really good pal called Alun Price, he was about four inches taller than me and a couple of years younger. He was known to be a bit of a 'nutter' in his local area and at school, but he was my squad mate in City of Cardiff Swimming Club and best pal. We had such a great laugh together. Anyway, Alun invited me to go roller skating at the local Top Rank in Cardiff. Typical lads, we were full of energy, laughter and ignorant innocence.
Sometimes I like to play around with song lyrics. They aren’t my strength, and when I’ve written them in the past I’ve had a partner.

But these same pigs may have left a terrifying invisible legacy. In their book, “The Hernando de Soto Expedition,” Ann Romenofsky and Patricia Galloway suggest that millions of Native people died because they lacked previous exposure to swine borne diseases, This previous exposure was critical in building their immune systems against the deadly diseases. These diseases include brucellosis, anthrax, leptospirosis, tuberculosis, trichinosis, cysticercosis and various strains of flu. Considering the fact that many swine diseases can be transmitted to deer and even turkeys, the two most important food animals used by southeastern Indians, the likelihood that this occurred becomes even greater.

Hello People! No matter what you hear about CHER and GREGG ALLMAN'S marriage being near an end, it's not as simple as that. Georgia Holt, Cher's mom, is the first to let you know that her daughter deeply loves Gregg. He's the first man Cher has deeply loved. Of course, she's not happy with his drug problem, what wife would be, but she nevertheless has made a commitment and she wants with all her heart to save this marriage. Cher has told her closest friends that if she and Gregg should finally call it quits, it would only be because they have decided it's the best thing for the two of them. "My daughter is really an old fashioned girl," Georgia says. She deeply believes in marriage and a healthy family."

I love the dead kids, but just as entertaining are October’s live friends Stacey (a boy with a Walkman) and Yumi. In one scene, Stacey tells off a popular girl/bully in such a fitting way that I cheered out loud reading it. The standout, however, in terms of secondary characters, is October’s father. With a book so filled with wisecracks and pop culture references, I expected to be entertained, but I didn’t expect to be touched. Yet the subplot about October and her clinically depressed father is heartwarming. His awkward attempts to connect with his daughter, and October’s desire to learn more about her mother, make you want to just hug them both. Take this passage:

And the hits just keep on coming. “The Daemons,” the onscreen title of which is “The Dæmons” (note the “æ” ligature), is yet another serial deserving of the label classic. It’s one of the most memorable and popular storylines of Jon Pertwee’s era, and probably the first Doctor Who tale to so clearly take mankind’s belief in a higher power to task, via that old chestnut from Arthur C. Clarke, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”

Unfortunately, this also means that I turn away guys that like me from the get go. I mean, if they like me so much, then they don’t get that I need to earn their love…so they’re not acceptable. I’ve internalized that they must be flawed to like me so much. In short: what is wrong with them that they have liked a screw up like me?
Now, I’m not going to bash Mr. Cosby. Not only is there no point to it, but having the ability to accept and respect another’s point of view is what I’m all about. And although Mr. Cosby’s outspokenness is old news by now, the issues he confronted are still very much relevant, and thus remain within my boundaries to tackle. With that being said, I’ll still probably watch The Cosby Show when it’s on Nick @ Nite – I’m just not sure if I’ll be able to watch it with the same level of enthusiasm as I once did.

Somewhere deep in the Tenderloin you can find a secretive wooden door, sometimes marked by 'Daddi-Dee' waiting to see if you'll bum him a cigarette or slide him a note. The journey through the less than calm streets to 743 Larkin is certainly worth making because once you step over the threshold from sidewalk to Olive, you'll find a charming little bar with the friendliest staff, a good selection of cocktails and a relaxed, happy go lucky vibe. Thankfully, Olive isn't trendy but it is cool. We love being surrounded by art we can't quite afford and Olive does a good job of displaying lots of desirable wall candy with exhibits that change regularly. It is a small, homely place with high white walls, a polished wooden floor, tall tables and bar stools plus two cubby hole booths, flanking the doorway, where larger groups of six or so can casually gather to eat, drink or do both. Olive is a great place to meet a bunch of people with different needs. Gathering a group of friends together informally can be an organisational nightmare sometimes, you know the score. Different arrival times, some have already eaten, others are starving whilst the rest just want a light nibble. Beer drinkers, wine drinkers, cocktail lovers - whatever - Olive caters for all of these scenarios with ease.
The comedy of Laid is tired, and that’s what initially got my goat about the series; so few Australian comedies come along during the year that it would have made a nice change for one of them to actually be funny. That doesn’t bother me as much after finishing the series. This isn’t a show that’s after big laughs, or really any laughs at all. This is a dark, quiet drama with sprinklings of wacky shenanigans. Unfortunately even looking at Laid in this new light doesn’t help its case. Laid just doesn’t work. It’s not terrible by any means, and I’m sure the show has its defenders but there are so many areas where it needs to improve that I can’t even half recommend the show.

Until recently I thought I was the laziest writer alive. I know I'm not really, because there's a bookshelf lined with books to prove otherwise, but when I'm idling at my desk - or doing something else altogether to avoid facing the screen - I feel incredibly lazy. There are writers who turn out three thousand words a day, or write tirelessly for hours on end. I just can't do that. Sometimes, especially at the start of a project, I have to cajole, bully and threaten myself in order to get anything done at all.

With Joe Rosa probably out, one wonders if Lukas will now just run FootLocker again. It is known that due to schedules the Rosa's can only do NXN and many people anticipated them meeting in Portland. Lukas, as well as Lutz, had been expected to do both series. With the expectation that Joe is done until track, Lukas may only be in San Diego. The match up of Lukas and Fustum, one that failed to happen last year when Futsum didn't show in Kenosha, would still be epic. I can only speculate right now as I anxiously await to see these guys race.

My youngest son watched this programme for a short time...it aired and he was soon off to school and on to bigger fish to swim with. I always thought it was rather silly, but then, what children's programming isn't silly to some degree? It's meant to be.
May 25-October 14, 2012: Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden is hosting the ButterfliesLIVE! exhibit. As with the prior exhibit in 2008, the Conservatory will be transformed to a showplace of tropical plants and butterflies. It’s a must-see event for anyone who loves to get up close and personal with butterflies.

This year, I took every possible precaution in order to guarantee my success. I lined the cake pans with parchment paper. I refrigerated the cake layers before assembling the cake. I made sure the frosting was the right consistency. I leveled each layer of cake. I refrigerated the cake again after applying a crumb coat. Most importantly, I was patient.

Result, Arthur was happy again, continued his favorite occupation and I was exhausted from lifting him up and down and moving him around.
Unfortunately, as you can see, Gonz was missing most of the stickers that went with this adventure. Below is a closeup of the only one he had featuring Rom. Note Rom arrived in a spaceship and his rocket pack is missing, at least on this sticker.
Of all the deaths of all the people I've never known, probably known have impacted me as much as the death of Andrew Breitbart. He was a true pioneer and warrior in the quest for truth and excellence in journalism. And of course, because of this, he made an abundance of enemies, probably more during his all too brief career than any one hundred people amass over the course of their entire lifetimes.
Oh, and that tumor? Benign!
The puppy (who we now called Biscuit) came down with Parvo a few days ago. Unlike Murray, Biscuit didn't have the stamina. Even though he had turned the corner and started drinking water on his own, the damage was too great on his little body. It makes me angry because we caught it early and started treatment immediately. But survival depends entirely on the dog's immune system.
There was so much more, but those were some of the highlights. I have to say though, that the best part of the conference was being able to share and discuss new learning with my colleagues. We never have enough time for this!
So there’s my wall-of-text summary, book report, analysis- thing of Mansfield Park. It feels good to write something that feels a bit like English papers back in the ol’ RU. Though I would never write one so damn colloquially or using half the language I used or the tangents… I do go off on tangents many a time. OK, so it’s nothing like the papers I wrote while still in school, but still… some sort of kinda a little bit maybe reminiscent of taking a book and interpreting it and writing a paper on it.

We also got asked to sponsor a pet photography workshop down in Melbourne by the multi awarded animal photographer and director of Wet Nose Fotos, Shannon Plummer. What’s even better is that they’ve teamed up with the dedicated volunteers at Homeless Hounds who will supply a plethora of dogs available for adoption for attendees to practice with at the workshop. It’s win-win! Participants will have the opportunity to not only practice on a variety of dogs breeds, but also various obedience and energy levels. We are thrilled to be sponsoring this great event and will be donating whatever we can.
About time! It's a wonder that these crooks have been allowed to get away with it for so long.
A great idea, it is indeed. Only it sucks.

It’s an odd mixture of strategy and unpredictability, allowing you to set up your battle choices yet completely undermine them at the same time. The main difference to other RPG battle systems is that you can’t target your enemies (or indeed your allies), and so far this has brought mixed results. On the one hand it ups the difficulty considerably, forcing players to consider, quite literally, every possible outcome if you’re facing off against more than one enemy. You’ve got to cover the possibility of magic vulnerability as well as magic resistance, keep track of your ability point count, and keep the damage level high while still keeping your characters alive. But it also risks taking the difficulty level to the extreme by the sheer random order of ensuing events.
Oh yeah, and I have changed my major to occupational therapy...I want to work with kids with special needs to cope and overcome those things that hold them back from their potential...EVERYONE is special to God!! I was going into social work, hoping to do attachment therapy with adoptive and foster kids because I really wanted to share my experience with other families, but the more I work to heal my babies, I realize that I don't have the emotional stamina to spend my work days see and hearing so much bad and then come home and be everything my kids need emotionally and mentally. I'm so excited to go into OT, especially the sensory end of things, and be able to work on the happier side of things, to have fun with the kids and see them progressing in their goals. As a bonus, there's also a lot more money in it and better hours!!! Yay! Life is so good right now!!
Q. Would the word "animal" fit?

Mr Robinson said he was “pretending to be stupid” and claimed “any reasonable person would have known the passports were for the provisional IRA”.
RUSH: Yeah, and so does the left. The left would be happy for a visit from Obama. The left is wondering, where is Obama, by the way? Where is he on Gitmo? Where is he on all these promises? Why are we still in Afghanistan? Now, here's something also interesting, too. Mr. Fineman, "What they want to do here is portray Obama and his allies as a sort of sixties-style bunch of radicals out to upset American values." No, Obama is portraying himself that way and his buddies are portraying themselves that way. What we are doing is reporting that that's what's happening, Howard. We are not trying to caricature Obama as that. We are the ones who have the honesty and integrity to tell people who Obama and his cohorts are. He is. The sixties, if you've read up on Obama, Obama wishes he had been front and center in the sixties. I mean that was community organizing as nirvana, that was agitation like it's never been done before.
Usually, I'm weaving scarves on the rigid heddle loom. That means I end up judging how much warp to weave into the header (for later unweaving) and how much to leave unwoven at the other end, so that there is sufficient warp leftover for fringe. Typically, for me, one end is entirely used up, and the other end gets about an inch trimmed off of it to match it up. I suppose if I took notes and measured, I could even get rid of that inch -- but my weaving stays more casual than controlled, so I've not kept a notepad handy in my weaving kit. There is a tape measure there, though.
To all my friends who are beaten down by life- in whatever way- don't give in to fears or lose your optimism. Darkness in which you cannot see the future does not mean there is nothing there. Patience and trusting in yourself and the way the universe works (however or whatever you believe in) will get you through (unless, perhaps you are an existentialist, in which case I don't know how you would deal with depression- read nausea maybe?)
The next step in the book is creating the farce (or stuffing) for the skins, then stuffing them, wrapping them in caul fat, and cooking them before serving them on a bed of green lentils. However, I knew the pieces of skin were too small (the largest, most intact one was 2x3") so I knew I couldn't finish this dish the way I had planned to, so I had to improvise and figure out something else. I decided to just serve the pig feet meat (great name for a band by the way, "Ladies and gentlemen, I give you: Piiiiiiiiiiig Feeeeeeeeet Meeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaat!!!!!!!!!!") over lentils. I thought it would taste pretty good.
I am a slow poke runner and I was not in any hurry to push it too hard. I just wanted to enjoy myself and enjoy the race and that is basically what I did! The weather was amazing and the canyon was gorgeous. The first 7 miles down the canyon was great and I loved seeing Dan waiting for me at the bottom of the canyon around mile 7. I was feeling good except for a little bit of problems with my knees. I stopped for some grapes, ibuprofen and a picture and then I continued on…

As soon as we have anything to report, we will let you know.
If he has to squeeze himself toothpaste style through rock walls to see an 800-year-old mud glyph, he wriggles. When the good old boys at the Creation rock concert cut the legs off live frogs and throw them into a skillet, he eats them. When his 92-year-old mentor, Andrew Lytle, in the grips of dementia, asks Sullivan to join him in bed to keep him warm, he snuggles.
With Cline’s success climbing the record charts, she was in high demand on the concert circuit. Although many women in country music at that time were considered “window dressing” or opening acts for the more popular and higher-paid male stars, Cline was the first to headline her own show and receive top billing above some of the male stars with whom she toured. While bands typically backed up the female singer, Cline led the band through the concert instead. She was so respected by men in the industry, that rather than being introduced to audiences as “Pretty Miss Patsy Cline” as her female contemporaries often were, she was given a more stately introduction such as that given by Johnny Cash on their 1962 tour together: “Ladies and gentlemen, the one and only Patsy Cline.” As an artist, she held her fan base in extremely high regard (many of whom became friends), staying for hours after concerts to chat and sign autographs.

Jonathan Newton, a senior from Nicholasville, presented a poster on Candidate Sites for Cold H2 Formation in Cold HI Emission and Other Tracers. He has been using a survey with the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico (where he was a summer intern last year) to look for clouds of cold gas that are becoming denser and colder in preparation for forming new stars.

In spite of the reassurances from Monsanto and its own lawyers and scientists that GMO cultures and Roundup herbicide are not health hazardous, it has been proven in their own research that rats have developed different forms of tumors and other health problems. However, instead of pushing the research further, they put a complete stop to it.
Even if that means catching a second (or even third) mental flight later that day. I just don’t gracefully shift gears back-and-forth throughout the day. So how about you? Is it easy to transition to different tasks throughout your day? If so, how do you do it without losing momentum, or spending a lot of time getting back up to speed when you return to a task?
Schooling. It's quantity over quality isn't it? Like mass produced shoes, shirts, furniture, sheets, cups and saucers. Make it as cheap as you can and sell at maximum profit.

Also add-on sales can be as easy as mailing out to existing customers. The hitrate will be lower but the effort will be minimal for the cash earned. If you have big customers / few customers then going there with the purpose of add-on sales is not frowned up on but actually expected. In this way you will do a customer satisfaction meeting and having the opportunity to expand and deepen your cooperation with the customer and even develop new products for said customer.
Why is that? Life is going on smoothly then all of a sudden a friend gets angry, a job opportunity goes out the window or family member is in trouble. Whatever the scenario is, it appears that life is falling apart. If two things go array, then I wait for the third. Habit I guess. Or a belief that things will magically turn around after the third disappointment. When we are happily moving through life why do we seem to miss a step and then fall flat on our face? Well, we could blame it on the Wheel of Fortune, the concept that we will eventually become down, or karma, or that things fall apart so we can appreciate what is working.
I will be making a few small gifts before my daughter's wedding in July. I saw this idea at The Purl Bee and knew that I would have to make these for her friends. Yes, sachets are a bit old fashion, but they are a wonderful way to keep your linen drawers and clothes smelling fresh,

But this is where the other great strength of ONE comes in. They have found great- and easy- ways to fight global poverty worldwide. They have an online petition you can sign demanding that the American government assign more funds to fight poverty. As has been said earlier, we spend 500 billion on military and only 16 billion fighting extreme poverty.
Green jobs encompass many industries. For environmental professionals, it can fall into the sectors of sustainability, protection, and conservation and preservation of natural resources. Within these areas are many different types of jobs, from consultants to scientists. It’s a broad employment range with lots of opportunities.
The truth is nothing of the sort, of course. The key fact that nobody seems to notice is that the study lasted for 40 years. 40 years? Shouldn't the men have died long before that? Once you ask that question, the truth begins to come out. The men recruited for the study ALREADY HAD tertiary syphilis. And in the tertiary stage the disease has usually been naturally "beaten" in some way. In other words, most such patients are no longer ill and live on rather as if they had never been infected. THAT intriguing fact was what sparked the study. It was an attempt to get more information about the life history of tertiary syphilitics. Richard Shweder has all the details.
FB has heard what what can happen to have-a-go heroes. He knew better than to go out on a limb and be the only one to intervene. He recognised that, without the support of the others, he was powerless.
Recently I was asked to write a guest post for the art blog "A Husk of Meaning." I chose to write about Duncan Grant. I am posting it today on my blog for those of you who may not have seen it. I hope I can shed some light on an artist whom I admire and of whom many people are unaware.
I’ll stem the horror and put Ruby’s character on the fringe – I will make the character an isolated case. This character describes (maybe just in “Zone of Proximity” sort of way, sorry for the jargon) a variety of contemporary people that actually exist – criminals in Supermax prisons, detainees at government facilities like Guantánamo Bay, people inside situations that they can neither cope with nor flee from, people that are in situations where they are no longer protected by the fragile blanket of the law.
As a consequence, a very tired sensitive D today, lots of stomping off, hasn’t even wanted to draw today and certainly not posing for a “Light It Up Blue” daily picture.

This delightful tale is perfect for young children just beginning to discover books. From Alligators to Zebras, children will learn their ABC’s and surely love the portrayal of each animal as it relates to the letters of the alphabet. The letter B is bouncing on the bear; the C is riding on the camel’s back; and the D is inside the dolphins’ mouth. The text consists of short simple rhymes and will certainly to hold the attention of even the youngest audience.
I think I won the bottom trumps of having the thinnest plectrum. I also had a big fat one that I used for the tunes I was more familiar with. This was nothing to do with planning and more to do with what was lurking in my bag.

I know that author events have had a huge impact on my own children’s reading. Thank you and bless you Francesca Simon for getting my youngest son interested in books! And gratitude also to Anthony Horowitz and Michelle Paver for extending his reading beyond Horrid Henry. I saw the effect of those events on his reading and his English over a two year period. But would I be able to prove that’s what made the difference? I wouldn’t know where to start.

So, this sunshine and rainbows view I had, and the fire in my belly to make sure this was a great experience for everyone, failed. Miserably. All it did was make me leave thinking this whole idea looks fantastic on paper. But it doesn't work. It doesn't matter if Kendall understands everything going on around her or the other kids all want to try and include her. It wasn't happening.

All Good Things by Leigh Somerville picks up where her first novel It All Started with a Dog left off, answering the question, “Will Rachel Springer marry John Turner?” Just when Rachel thought the biggest challenge was choosing a wedding dress, her ditsy friend Susan shares a painful secret that shakes her already shaky confidence in love. A bequest from Rachel’s grandmother — and a near-death experience with John’s grandson, Ben — help her make the decision that changes the lives of every character in the book.

All summer long – I blogged about the weather, because there was nothing I could do to change it – winds brought cloud and rain from the west: dragged it kicking and screaming across the Grampian Mountains – that famous Roman chain that spawned Mons Graupius, which usually blocks precipitation – and dumped it on Aberdeenshire.
I want to clarify that I’m not a feminist. I DO believe that yes, as the person who is home, it makes sense for me to do the cooking and most of the cleaning. What upsets me… what really gets my goat (lol) is that I HAVE to do it. That its an expectation. Because apparently I’m just sitting at home with all this oodles of time on my hand.

I guess the problem, to me, is that I don't know that I really HAVE a single favorite beer. And as I continue to try more and more different beers of different styles from different breweries, that mental database of great brew I've tasted gets more and more muddled and it becomes even harder to pick a single top standout. And I don't think most people who ask about my favorite beer will have the patience to stand there waiting for an answer while I peruse my Untappd history. Hell, I have a hard time picking what I want for lunch most of the time, how am I supposed to pick my favorite beer EVER?

We spent a weekend exploring Cades Cove, Little River Road and Newfound Gap. We also added a waterfall — Meigs Falls — to the collection we had just started. We were even able to experience some good mountain music at the lodge at which we stayed.
But I suppose I could be wrong. I suppose if we lived in a society that let everyone have the freedom to succeed or fail, no matter what, and the commenter were involved in some mishap and sustained life threatening injuries and an ambulance arrived, but the EMT refused to treat him because Mr. Freedom Lover chose not to carry health insurance, I suppose as the EMT snapped the laryngoscope back into its protective case, if the EMT were observant, he might see a hint of a smile at the corners of Mr. Freedom Lover's blood covered mouth, as Mr. Freedom Lover aspirated his own blood, a hint of a smile from the satisfaction Mr. Freedom Lover felt knowing he was living in a society where he had the freedom to suffocate on his own blood because he chose not to carry health insurance.
My first order of business yesterday morning, was to head to the annual once a month Red Barn Sale!! It runs once a month from March to October, I do believe. I found this sale last year on their last sale of the year. For all my primitive blogging friends, I tell you what, you would love this sale! And the prices were awesome! I asked the owner for permission to take some photos to post and my blog and she was more then happy to oblige. I'll show you the goodies of what I bought after I show you all the goodies they had for sale!

Dale lives in southeastern Minnesota now and, through the years, has uncovered morel hotbeds.

One would think that a novel that takes place on an enclosed ship would become extremely boring after a time. Beth Revis really knows how to propel the plot forward without dragging scenes or parts on. This novel was a page turner for myself, and I found it flying by in no time at all.

So today I had hired a photographer to teach me how to take good reproduction photos of my paintings and how to use photoshop better for the afterwork. I had a vague idea of how most works, but learning from a professional sure makes a difference! It's a smart short cut. Now I am asking myself why I didn't do this earlier... Not that I can say I'm mastering it, but after a little bit more of practice ... ?
Everybody knows of the Tea Party movement that arose spontaneously in the first year of the Obama administration to oppose Obamacare and other initiatives, but I suspect that few know much about the original tea party that sparked the American Revolution. That has been remedied by American Tempest, ($26.00, Da Capo Press) written by Harlow Giles Unger, the author of more than seventeen books about the Founding Fathers and the Revolution. On December 15, 1773, an estimated seven dozen men, many dressed as Indians who were then a symbol of freedom, dumped more than 300 chests of tea worth the equivalent of $1 million today, into the Boston Harbor to protest British taxes, mostly levied to pay for its wars with France. This is a fascinating story considering they were taking on the greatest power of its time. I love reading history and especially American history, so you can imagine how pleased I was to receive The War of the Revolution by Christopher War ($19.95, Skyhorse Publishing, softcover) which is a complete history of the battles that resulted in the achievement of independence. From the first musket shot at Lexington and Concord to the final battle at Yorktown, this book brings the long effort to life with stories of those who participated, maps, and the realization that it took unbelievable tenacity to wage the war over six long years against tremendous odds and against what was, at the time, the greatest empire of the age. The way the Revolution is taught in our schools hardly begins to reveal how much we owe to Washington and his troops. This 1,000-page book has long been regarded as a classic and now, happily, it is available in an affordable softcover.

Relying on a subtext for meaning or critique is often a dangerous thing. Remember in High Fidelity when the main character admits honestly to the “danger of using someone else’s poetry” when making a mix tape for a girlfriend? The text of the songs say one thing (whatever Al Green wanted them to mean), but the girl can easily misunderstand the guy’s gesture because the song has a subtext which only the girl knows. This can be only her fantasy of what the song means, and the situation can get complicated for the guy. Out of the world of love and in the world of critique, the subtextual possibilities of signs can even be more dangerous. Sometimes the signs put forward for critique simply enact the fantasy meant to be condemned or at least the result is confusing like a bad mix tape.
And more events without context. This is still not a plot.
Sometimes the best planned things just work out different. It's sometimes better; it's sometimes worse but plans can be considered "torn asunder".
Impact investing is poised to draw in significant new dollars to fund social and environmental efforts. It also brings with it the responsibilities of markets for reporting requirements, financial disclosure, listing information, and new monitors and overseers. How will these policies, regulators, responsibilities and expectations fit into existing frames for nonprofits and philanthropy? Where are there potential conflicts? How will the new social economy, which includes philanthropy, impact investing, and tech driven options for using private resources for public good make sense of all these different domains?
He just flat out lied about our close relationship with Israel... I'm sure they're those who live there that beg to differ! He's done nothing for Israel, and I pray that he hasn't done irreparable damage.
I had exited one hell and stepped into another. All around there was nothing but burning ash and molten lava. What had I done? I needed to find my mark, and get out as quickly as possible. Luckily, the denizens of the cave were no match for Petkinz and me. Even the dreaded felguard commander, Taragaman, fell easily to my arrows. And with his death I rose to new heights.

Earlier today, while on the island of Corsica, town of Ajaccio on the western coastline, a young Barry Soetoro aka Barack Obama, age 19, appeared out of a time portal and warned me that another version of himself would attempt to assassinate me, sent by Donald Rumsfeld from 1987 through the Montauk base that was messing around with time.

I ordered this at the same time as the zombie kit (both from Barnes and Nobles book store) but for some reason they were delivered separately. This arrived yesterday. There are a lot of cards in there that I just love so I am going to try to stitch a few cards to send out this upcoming Christmas. The only card charts I had until I got this book were the ones that came in my UK stitching magazines. While stitching the card for breast cancer fundraiser I realized I was really enjoying stitching such a small design as there is a lot of instant gratification. Until this point I did not think I would like stitching cards, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that I do enjoy it, so I went ahead and ordered this book. The cards inside are beautiful!

Lakosha returned to a more neutral posture. “I am glad you understand. I have spoken with Brother Kalim and others in the high order. We understand that you are out of practice at the moment, and shall not be requesting your presence for any high combat areas for the time being, such as in Northrend, in the fight against the Lich King. But a request had come in from our fellow human Paladins in Stormwind. They are looking for an expert in the Light to help guide troubled youth. And given your recent activities, you would seem to fit the bill for that job.”

Back in this post I promised I would share some pictures of the vintage salt and pepper shakers I received from grandma a little awhile ago. Well, I'm finally getting around to showing you all of them. They all date from the 1930s and 1940s and were part of a collection my Grandma (Dad's mom) started when she was a little girl. The collection was recently split between two of my cousins, my aunt and myself and I am so excited to have some of these pieces in our home! Here's an overview of them all.

In my humble Banshee opinion entering contests is a good thing but I can’t see pinning all of my hopes on a contest win. I can see that there are some intangible benefits. The more you submit (or enter), the more exposure your work will get. With every submission (even if you don’t win or get published), you build on your experience, your body of work. This will lead to more confidence. It’s about getting out there.

Last night I went to see Jenn Ashworth read at the Rose Theatre (Edge Hill University). She read from her novel A Kind of Intimacy. The chapters which she read to us were both funny and touching and it was fabulous to hear the opening of the novel in the voice of its author. Jenn is only 27 and has just completed her second novel which she also read from last night. I was simultaneously inspired and depressed by her brilliance! I bought a copy of A Kind of Intimacy this morning, along with a couple of collections of Helen Simpson’s short stories. It will be very quiet in our house after that particular parcel arrives.
I cannot begin to tell you what the water felt like. Memories of all those mid afternoons and early mornings spent lapping back and forth across the pool rushed back my limbs and suddenly I was half way across the pool and oh my God... it was, no joke, heaven. If there is a heaven, mine has a long course swimming pool. With the little flags over the top for backstrokers.

‘I mean, after all I went through, all this death, and then it’s over like that?’
I wrote him a letter, telling him my feelings, and he didn’t care – or wasn’t able to care – which amounts to the same thing because it left me alone, again. He can only see his need, which is why I love him, because I know what it’s like to need. The problem is, it’s just a cycle of familiarity without help or healing. A friend once described the pain as being on fire, and I didn’t truly understand what she meant at the time, but I do now. The numbness is the deadened nerves, the shut-down heart, the walking through this world just waiting for the end.

I have had so little time at home in the past few months, I am in SERIOUS craft withdrawal! And the new blogger set-up - makes me weep. I hate having to relearn technical stuff and now I am going to have to figure out where all the blogs I follow are! I hope to have some time soon to do that and come visit. It isn't indifference that has caused me to miss visiting.

You may not always want to be patient when dealing with a real estate agent.

You might not want to agree with them all the time, but their consultation will help you get your home sold faster.
Sorry for the cruddy picture. I'll get a better one put up when I get home - hopefully.
ME.... I decided it was time to get to know my front lawn a bit better.... You see I live in a small gated community and I am the first corner house. When I moved in (almost 3 years now) I was much more interested in making sure the flower beds looked great and pretty much ignored the lawn. It had weeds, but when I came home from a walk with the dogs on Saturday I noticed that there were more weeds than grass on the lawn... And not the nice weeds... but the mean one... PUNCTUREVINE!
Everything is the same. We're talking about starting up on some of the bigger projects (ceiling in back room, finishing the other 2 bedrooms upstairs etc). It's been two months since I've done any big projects, a bit longer than that for Yen. I suppose it's time to get back at it. I am pretty tired of doing all this stuff and would like it to just be DONE.

This is probably far from the truth, but I felt as though that side of the family believed we thought we were better than them in some way. I’ve proclaimed all my life that “I’m half!” but I have really only known the white side. I’ll even brag about being half Ukrainian, because it always seems to catch people by surprise. So, when the time came, and I stood hand-to-hand with these Others, I felt like I had betrayed them in some way for being so close to my mom’s side…because not once in my life have I ever evenly floated between the two worlds.

This compact thriller takes place in a border town in New Mexico and, like a good deal of Woolrich’s material, sees a tragic train of events set in motion by a foolish mishap. In this case the event in question is brought about when a night club performer, Kiki (Jean Brooks), goes along with the suggestion of her manager/publicist, Jerry Manning (Dennis O’Keefe), that she should make a dramatic entrance with a black leopard on a leash. The idea is to draw the spotlight and simultaneously upstage her rival, flamenco dancer Clo-Clo (Margo). Not a bad plan, as far as it goes. The trouble arises when Clo-Clo, in a fit of pique, startles the beast with the clacking of her castanets, causing it to bolt and and slip away into the shadowy streets of the town. This leads to one of the most celebrated sequences in producer Lewton’s movies. A young girl, a bit of a dreamer and slacker if the truth be known, is sent on a shopping errand by an impatient and exasperated mother. The girl tries to beg off, citing her fear of the wild animal roaming the surrounding countryside, but the mother is having none of it. To her, her daughter has too fanciful an imagination and too little sense of responsibility. The girl’s trip to the only store open at such a late hour, and more especially the return, is an exercise in how to draw tension tight through the use of suggestion and shadowy visuals. What makes this succeed is the fact that the growing panic and dread of the girl match perfectly what the viewers feel as we accompany her on her journey. The tragic outcome, playing on the old fable of the boy who cried wolf, is all the more effective as a result of our experiencing the same emotions as the girl. Suddenly, this sleepy backwater is transformed into a community stalked by fear and suspicion as the apparent victims of the escaped cat start to mount up. As I said in the introduction, this is not a real horror movie in the true sense of the word. There is nothing of the supernatural involved, unless you count Isabel Jewell’s gypsy fortune teller, yet the sense of menace is palpable throughout.

By the way, if you have an iPhone, I highly recommend the Instagram App. You can find me there (marichellehills) - it's my new shortcut to blogging! It's basically a feed of pics that I share with captions, like the ones above. That's our little cutie pie testing out her new reading nook - she's growing into quite the little lady - 1½ years old now! Can you believe it?? We still can't believe how quickly it's all going. Sometimes I look at her in the morning and I'm convinced that she's grown two inches overnight. She's walking, talking (words only) and making us laugh on a daily basis.

Example: Case is pending in a forum which allows for electronic filing of documents and service by email or U.S. Mail. You get 5 days to respond, but you get extra time added to that if service is by U.S. Mail. Attorneys for the other side e-filed a motion. The service certificate attached to the motion states that they emailed it to me on the date it was filed. It does not state that it was snail-mailed. I received a copy via U.S. Mail 5 days after it was filed. Remember: the response time was 5 days, if served by email. So now I am receiving a motion and the response is due later that same day.
The way life is clicking by so quickly, I don't want to wake up and find that twenty years have flown by the way the last twenty have, and that suddenly I can't do the things I want to do any longer.

In response to his father’s astonishingly affectionate greeting, the younger son begins his prepared remarks, but, significantly, stops before getting to the restitution part. He only acknowledges the sad truth about himself, and leaves it at that. He finally relinquishes any pretense that he is able of his own strength to make things right. How could anyone who has callously wounded such a generous father speak of repayment? He makes his confession, and leaves judgment to his father.

The bar code system is an automatic system that tracks students, who walk and bicycle to school, more accurately and efficiently. Before the bar code system, volunteer parents manually counted and entered data into a database. An integral administrative part of the program is setting up the bar code website, called Active 4 Me, and uploading data from the wireless scanners. At Orrenmaa Elementary School, the Instructional Computer Assistant will be the on-site administrator and register students into the online system. The Instructional Computer Assistant will incorporate the Walking Program data and rewards system into her school curriculum, which allows students to monitor their own progress using the new website.
Quick Quick update. So I have taken 2 weeks off from running and biking to rest my quad. Man let me tell you its TOUGH. I seriously have an addiction ;).

And Ted is his brother, who is a lowly janitor and, still hurting that Fred seduced Ted's wife away from him and drove her to off herself, decides that it's a good idea to steal Fred's body from the linen closet/funeral parlor and take him to his house, yell at him, drink from a coffee mug shaped like a female breast, dress him up in a clown suit and bury him under his house. But then, as Ted is digging his brother's grave, something strange is about to happen....

Michelle also designs patterns and makes small quilts using her folk art fusion technique. Her latest pattern, For The Love of Spring, really caught my eye when she showed it on her blog. Last week she sent me the pattern to test for her (it has nothing to do with the fact that I drooled when I saw it) - oh my goodness, how fun is that! I was so excited that she sent it one day and I made it the next. :) Yes, it really was that fast. An afternoon and it was done! I love the primitive look of these flowers.
When I first heard about this Obari guy, I was comfortable sitting with the notion many people had that “he’s just a guy who likes doing fanservicey shows” – I’m not going to deny Obari loves fanservice and has worked on several hentai anime works, this won’t be my aim. However I think many people only see the fanservice side of him and simply write him off in regards to any thing else. This is understandable if you only judge him by the works where his the director, judge him as an animator then I think you might get a different view of him.

Bars are the social epicenter in any strip club. Dancers use the bar to seek out potential customers. Dancers can smell money all the way from the dressing room. Dancers know that all the fresh meat in the place (the guys who still have cash in their pocket) will be sitting at the bar. Customers might think they are the only ones who are sizing up the inventory. Little do they know, the dancer has already decided on which guy at the bar has the most money. This assessment will determine which guy she will introduce herself to first.

Some have prefered to see the hey being there for it’s number, which is five. According to E. W. Bullinger, in Number in Scripture, the number five is the number of grace. This is correct, and thus makes the name YHVH a hand, with a nail surrounded by grace. While this is a fine interpretation, when dealing with symbols, I prefer the mystery components previously stated. The reason for this is found in the spelling of Yeshua’s name:
I am hoping by journaling this it will help me begin to deal with the loss of Indy and Maui. My husband and I have discussed it and we both agree that we do not want another cat at this time.

They were more than just pets, they were family. They will be truly missed!

A woman is brought before Jesus accused of adultery. We have no indication or evidence in the scripture that adds, “She was caught and here are the two witnesses as well as the man she was with.” Besides that fact that Jesus already knew what was happening this would have been a tell-tale sign that something was very wrong with the picture. And who was the woman?

The first one I opened was La Meule: 6% ABV and proclaiming itself a bière de garde, one of those catch-all styles that can mean anything as long as its brown-ish and hazy. Which this is. The secret miracle ingredient is sage, for extra farmhouse rusticity, I suppose. The herb leaps out of the aroma combining with fruity citric smells as well. On tasting it's quite dry and rather funky: I detect the presence of brettanomyces in spades. After the initial shock there are some beautiful Jaffa orange notes and a touch of aftershave spice. It reminds me of something and I wave away the late sage flavour which isn't part of the recollection. Orval. It tastes a lot like Orval, only with sage in it. A horror to Orval purists I'm sure, but an undeniably interesting beer and one which I quite enjoyed.

After church, my parents headed to “Dunkin Donuts” to get some coffee. Heather and I went home. We changed clothes and I started to clean the porch from all the work that we did yesterday. After a little while, my dad and I headed over to pick up the kids from church and came home. We sat down and had a lunch having sandwiches, Middlesworth potato chips (my favorite!) and some drinks. After that, my parents left and headed home. I headed outside and did a little more work and then went into the basement and took a short nap. After my nap, I worked on this blog and catching up on some work that I had put aside for all the work I did for Friday and Thursday this past week. While I did that, I watched “Gene Simmons Family Jewels”, three episodes of “Dr. Phil”. I also started to put up some more of my miniatures from my “Lord of the Rings” Games Workshop line on Ebay. After that, I left the house to go pick up Ruth from Binghamton Youth Symphony Orchestra. I then got some gas and came home.

Initially, I wondered about what might happen with my dad's side of the family. Would he pressure them to cut off relationships with me too? This made it more of a challenge for me to recover from his decisions, more difficult to come to terms with the damage he was doing. If I only saw my grandparents at my dad's house on holidays, how would this work for the future? In the end, I found a way to manage my relationship with each of them individually. I don't discuss my dad with his parents. I don't discuss my dad with my half siblings. To my dad's credit, he has kept his life choices his own, and no one was forced to stop talking to me. I am grateful. My grandmother has tried to get us together a couple of times, but I've told her no. I think she is trying to manage her own anxiety around it, around raising a son that could do this to his own daughter...and it isn't really about mending my father and me, but more about her own worries and issues. And, frankly, that's
At the moments when I had to move forward and literally take things moment by moment, I could handle things. I didn't have room for the emotions because I was focused on the crisis. As I was sitting in my pool of emotions, I realized that I wasn't in a crisis situation, but it had become normal for me to be in crisis, and without an actual crisis to hold my focus, I was vulnerable to seeing the reality of the situation.

Artistically, the film is amazing. The music is perfect; I barely noticed the first few times because it fits so well into the story, but it is gorgeous in its own right as well. The acting is – for the most part – well done: Bryce Dallas Howard is ethereal, and Paul Giamatti stole my heart. Every shot is composed with purpose as part of the whole tale. Camera angles bring out a dull but gritty sense of reality.

He gently stroked my head and brought this image to my mind. As a parent, often your small child will come and present you with a wonderful drawing they have made for you. Perhaps it is a card or a picture that they have sat at their table and lovingly made you something special. They present you with the art work. They are proud and hopeful that you will love it, it was the best they could do. You smile broadly and gush over how beautiful it is, you hug them and thank them for the wonderful gift. You do not look at it and judge it for what it is not, for most certainly it is not the Mona Lisa! Even so, you recognize that the offering is precious because they are incapable of doing better and you love them and the picture, exactly the way it is.
I see many people LOST…lost in the present and in their eager of OBTAINING OBJECTS, that they forget about everything else.

“The soldiers of Destroyer talked about how their house searches had become demolition parties. They shattered windows and china, broke furniture, hurled civilians to the ground. Earlier that day, they had blown up a building. They tornadoed through Afghan houses and left such destruction that their ANA allies at first tried to stop them, then grew angry, sullen.
We are been out here knowing that if we were in the UK there would be little we could do to help. It is all down to the medical profession and their expertise. We have daily phone-calls with our daughter, being sounding boards and giving constant love and encouragement. It is heartbreaking… and I pray a lot.

Geej and I are going to a birthday party tomorrow where there will be a pony for riding. Last time she had the opportunity to ride a pony, she was too scared. But she's been talking about this and fired up for a week now, so we'll see if she is ready to go for it. I hope so, because how else am I going to get her interested in this: Welcome to Ponyville! Holy CRAP, people!! How do I protect my daughter from this marketing onslaught? Jesus H. Christ. Speaking of...I have a whole bitchtastic post brewing about the whole branding/marketing thing and kiddos. I know it's not groundbreaking, but I'm just now facing it with my kiddo, and it makes me wanna punch someone in a suit. Hard.

My first appointment with the breast surgeon was very informative. I learned that there are many different types of breast cancer. Mine was a slow-growing. It involved the mammary glands. I learned your breast are made up of fatty tissue, muscle and that the mammary glands are nodes grouped together like a cluster of grapes. One of those nodes had developed into a tumor and was cancer. That if I was to have breast cancer the form I had was the kind to have and that it was a miracle I had discovered it in a self exam. Most of the time when a woman is diagnosed with this kind it is advanced because the majority of the time the mammogram will miss it until it is 2cm or more. It was decided that my surgery would continue and that we would address the cancer after I recuperated from this surgery. The tumor was benign in my abdomen. The biopsy of the tumor in my breast showed that my cancer was hormone aggressive so I chose to have a hysterectomy while they were removing the tumor. I spent ten days in the hospital.
“So, it was with great dismay that we learned that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) today released a document on the recent ”Doctrinal Assessment of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious,” (LCWR) in which the Congregation announced the appointment of an Archbishop Delegate to oversee LCWR’s activities. We are even more deeply saddened that support of New Ways Ministry by women’s religious communities and by LCWR leaders was singled out as one of the reasons that a doctrinal assessment was undertaken. From the document:

And with the black heels, some of those shoes were so beat up, it was a wonder I still had them. I ended up throwing out at least 4 of those heels, donated 3 others and still had 3 that had enough diversity in them to suit me just fine. It was onto the second part of the project.

Then everyone would know. That I'm pretending these days. That I'm anything but okay after I lock my apartment door. That I keep half expecting to suddenly see him when I turn around.

Lustrous beads of sweat.
Another great thing about tea is that it is so, well... British. Drinking tea is, by definition, one of the most British things a person can do. And since it is my life's goal to one day become a British citizen, it's great practice for the future! Hehe. Really, though, if you drink tea, then you are automatically cool. In a prim, proper, sophisticated way. Because drinking tea is a sort of posh thing to do, compared to us Americans who drink practically a gallon of Starbucks a day. (Blech.)

After the French Revolution and the overthrow of Louis XVI, most whites in San Domingo expected to receive more say in running the colony. This hope turned to terror as they learned of the new regime’s revolutionary racial plans. In 1788 a French pamphleteer named Jacques Brissot had formed the Amis des Noirs (Friends of the Blacks). Patterned after English abolitionist groups, the society soon became far more radical. Most of the future Jacobin leaders such as Lafayette, Condorcet, Mirabeau and Robbespierre were members, and chapters soon spread throughout France. San Domingo was subject to French rule, and colonists began to wonder how far these zealots would take their slogan “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.”In the words of Mirabeau, whites “slept on the edge of Vesuvius”

I don’t know about you but if you want my attention tell me I am not who I claim to be and you will get it. The word Hypocrite comes from the greek word hypokritēs that means a person who plays a part and actor or a mime. It means your acting like some thing you’re not.
Mainstream movies come with a lot of hype and the expectations are set even before watching the movies. Even if we know nothing about the movies, we tend to recognize the actors. That kind of sets the expectations based on the actors’ larger than life star image. The stories often end up being pushed backstage. On the other hand when you just stumble into a movie, you have never heard of with actors you have never seen before, the stories and acting come front stage.

Then I remembered Erin’s piece of advice and I found something unexpected to do with my characters. It excited me so much that I couldn’t wait to get the idea down on paper, so to speak. I couldn’t wait to see what would happen next. My characters didn’t go somewhere bizarre for their story. A character I planned on harassing my main character instead apologized, and it led the story in a different direction than I’d planned, but a direction that did eventually lead where I needed the story to go.

The McBrothers did. They adopted the model pioneered at the Edgefield and converted the classrooms into hotel rooms, turned the gym into a movie theater, scattered pubs and restaurants throughout. They even converted a few of the rooms into conference and ballroom space. On most weekends, you'll see a wedding in the second gym. I attended a conference and watched a political campaign get launched there. In fact, when they opened, they offered the space free to local groups.
I'm also going to add that last year I reviewed her debut novel Sleep Before Evening, which is also absolutely brilliant. You can check that out HERE.

So is it delusion over King Kenny’s status at Liverpool or is it because they still have pride and dignity over what they have achieved?

Now I won’t be the first woman to bemoan the demise of large, comfortable knickers, but it really is a matter close to my heart. Last week my manager anonymously received a series of tasteless knickers on his desk, the worst pair apparently having been created using a fisherman’s net and a prostitute’s ankle chain. It might have been sent by a female, but I seriously doubt it; what woman would want to be associated with a pair of knickers which screams ‘PAY HERE’ and ‘ARSE-DEATH’ simultaneously?

In a more muted environment the Italian has also made his mark with vigorous form. His team came to this occasion unbeaten over its last 11 fixtures in all competitions, which has in the process taken them to the FA Cup final.

When J and I were first together, we were having an idyllic Sunday morning, reading the Sunday paper in bed.

So I am now obsessed with Phoebe Prince. There has been a fair amount of finger pointing as to who is at fault. The school, the bullies, the parents of the nine bullies, society at large...you and me. Have you ever looked the other way when you have witnessed a bullying situation ? Would you step in and get involved ? We must. Our society must take a stand against the bullies of the world. And I mean that wholeheartedly and sincerely.

It started out as a normal day. As we had been Friday and Saturday, we were paying attention to the news to see coverage of the tornado damage inflicted on our state and neighboring states. We were touched by the story of the baby girl found in a field, all alone, near her home. We were touched more deeply when we heard that all other members of her family had been killed and she was in critical condition. And we, as a family, were saddened to hear of her passing.

Borough President Marty Markowitz, the project’s leading political booster, sounded angry and embattled. “Let the word go out,” he insisted, “the overwhelming number of Brooklynites support Atlantic Yards.” That statement got relatively little applause, though other pro-project statements he made generated more applause. “Enough years have already occurred. It’s time to make this happen.”

In training and coaching, I always hear a lot of cause and effect. Things happen in life that cause effects. And some we have control over. But there are also those we don’t. What I see is a lack of change happening, because so much of our time is spent on consoling the effects that are caused by the actual cause, that nothing ever changes, and everyone maintains focus on the not so enjoyable effects.

The greenhouse is a conical glass building that uses an internal "transportation helix" to carry potted vegetables around on conveyors. As plants travel around the helix, they rotate for maximum sun exposure. Hassle says the building will use less energy than a traditional greenhouse, take advantage of "spillage heat" energy companies cannot sell, digest waste to produce biogas and plant fertilizers, and decrease carbon dioxide emissions while eliminating the environmental costs of long-distance transportation. And growing plants in a controlled environment will decrease the amount of water, energy, and pesticides needed.

“The death of Lincoln was a disaster for Christendom. There was no man in the United States great enough to wear his boots and the bankers went anew to grab the riches.

They will not hesitate to plunge the whole of Christendom into wars and chaos in order that the earth should become their inheritance.” – Otto von Bismarck

And then there is the developing campaign to legalise 'assisted suicide'. We are just about to be faced with the appalling prospect of an orchestrated campaign to change the law - a sensitive and complex issue. But legalisation is a terrible threat to vulnerable people and must be resisted. As Parliamentarians, we are charged with basing legislative change on evidence rather than intuitive responses. I find these battles every bit as challenging as anything else I've ever done. Will have to have a word with Phillip. There is a massive job facing him as an MP.

The world Lowry created is an interesting one. Everything is very precise and very controlled- to the point that there is no color, and there are no choices.

I certainly wouldn’t want that.
While reading through the book I decided the best way to share it with you would be to share some quotes. The book is great and yes, you should buy it. No, I'm not just saying that because I got it for free. It really is some good stuff, and there's one page that made the tears roll down my cheeks because the truth? Oh it was evident and powerful and a punch-in-the-gut while being a deep sigh of relief all at the same time.
OWS has been accused of not having a policy proposal – a solution to the problem of inequality. At the present, this charge is unwarranted. A protest movement doesn’t need policy memos, only a sense of right and wrong. However, a social movement that wants to not merely register discontent but to actually exercise power does need an agenda. A time will come when OWS will have to choose.

String the bracelet. We used black elastic beading cord (Stretchrite Beading Cord Elastic 5 Yards Black 3961-B) to thread through the four formed glass pieces of our bracelet. The truth is this cord is not a product we use often. It may have been left from a project my daughter and I did with the girl scout troop, but the cord worked well. We both liked the look of the black against red and the black beading cord accomplished our goal of creating the look of a glass cuff bracelet.

But that’s just it. Tim’s message is so inherently linked to celebrity success and the platform that it brings, that they are not hearing an objective message about faith. They are hearing that God is the way to get to the same celebrity threshold if they make similar religious choice. It’s really no different than a faith and prosperity preacher saying that the path to riches is through his or her teachings, except that a religious preacher’s message made him popular. A sport’s star’s messages is almost always related to his on field production.
The lame hen (Yarrow) and the broken winged hen ( Comfrey) are doing ok in the Polytunnel - I open up the really rather tiny Broody ark first thing so they can wander around the polytunnel and talk to the other two baldy hens inside the big run in the polytunnel - these two are ok health wise but are weak and bald so need a bit of tlc and feeding up before they can go outside. I still have not named these two but am musing about it.
I decided to make my son some felt animal finger-puppets. He loves animals, especially monkeys, right now and we're working on learning how to pronounce all their names and make the noises they make. I thought finger puppets would be a great way to supplement the learning-about-animals we've been doing with books, Fisher-Price Little People, singing "Old McDonald", and staring & pointing at the occasional woodland creature who strays into our "backyard" (We live in an apartment, so I'm using the term pretty loosely).
If you answered YES to all three questions then consider this: It is a historical fact that the Roman Catholic Church put the Bible together as we have it today at the Councils of Rome (381 A.D.), Hippo (393 A.D.), and Carthage (397 A.D.). Any Encyclopedia should address this fact for confirmation if you don’t believe me. Since it was the Roman Catholic Church that clearly had the Holy Spirit to put the Bible together and to recognize (see proposition c. above) which books were inspired, wouldn’t they have the same Holy Spirit to know the interpretation of those books? I believe they do, and if you are a

In our faith there can become cliques of philosophy, that we can become adapted to and shaped by. For me its the new monastic movement, I find that it appeals to me, the scripture and verses they use seem to click enforcing the way they look at the Christian faith. Thats great, I have learnt so much from members of that movement, its shaped me as a person, but do I know it for myself? Or have I just taken and shared a photocopy of my faith, a photocopy of God. Do I know the word of God enough to be built on it? Or am I building on a mismatch and collage of others ideas, to rebrand and present ways of doing things that are actually the same, they just look different?
How we think about something can have a profound effect on how we do that thing.

Yes, why was I waiting, sleeping in a rather uncomfortable mattress, just because I was waiting for Mr. Right??? Then other questions, comments and the sort started scrolling in my mind. One of those thoughts was even with Mr. Right, would I end up with the mattress that I wanted. The answer that popped into my mind was – maybe not, more than likely not.

Wine selections draw from around the world, featuring both old and new world selections by the bottle and the glass. While big spenders can order the last bottle of a vintage Dom Per for about $1,200 bucks, value seekers will rejoice in the discovery of some pleasant Spanish bottles under $40 and the terrific presentation beer in grand chilled glasses.

I usually find the Winter collections more appealing, perhaps this is just because seeing an influx of polonecks and cosy looking parkas while it's still chilly outside is physically appealing but either way the New York collections excited me more than usual. As naughty as it is to admit somethings I view NYFW as a bit of a pre-cursor to the more exciting and less commercial shows. (Proenza Schouler, Rodarte, Rachel Comey are exampt from this generalisation). But back to this season. Edun in particular which grows on me with every season, had a very cool ease about it. The sort of collection that has been styled well but would still serve you well once the outfits have been deconstructed and individual pieces worn. It always niggles me when you realise a collection that looked so wonderful on the catwalk was down to canny styling and it's brilliance doesn't quite translate onto the rails.

Last night we had our first 2 unit water, for several weeks since a the March deluge dropped 7” of rainfall on the Twin Lakes area and heavier falls we seen higher in the catchment. Since then its been a race against time to get Bull Shoals down before the April 14 deadline for mandated lower flow for agricultural needs in eastern Arkansas.
His success can be attributed to several factors, in addition to his seminal autobiography: his long tenure in this country, his personal charisma, his results-driven package of offerings, and his appeal to both secular and religious students. Everyone who meditates, goes to yoga classes or has, in any way, benefited from India’s great spiritual heritage, owes a debt of gratitude to Yogananda. It is only fitting that he is interred in the resting place of so many American celebrities, Forest Lawn Memorial Park, five miles from the hilltop sanctuary that he made his home.
And I find that comforting – because on a different, very much lower level, that’s what we try to do too. The key to celebrating the past is understanding it, and that’s certainly what I aspire to in my writing. Those French peasants who crafted the terracotta figurines and arranged them to tell a story were exploring history just as we do, and it’s a tradition to which I can feel proud to belong.

Any ordinary man with a little intelligence and willpower, can breed chickens or pigs and make a profit. This is not the type of man I am referring to here. Those individuals who practice meagre subsistence farming, and who only produce enough to feed their families or small groups in their community, do not fall into the category I am going to discuss in this post.
I do hope that somewhere along the way, you thought we were genuine friends. That’s what I thought the whole time. I hope that I was the cause of at least one of the things that made you happy or laugh, because I sincerely wanted you to find whatever it was funny and just… laugh.

The Obama administration appears to be preparing for a long drawn out war in the Middle East, or at the very least, an expected crisis that will require the need to override Constitutional authority and claim dominion over all resources in the United States under the guise of national defense. With the rise in Disaster Preparedness growing for both individuals and states leading up to yesterday's Executive Order, the mood of the nation points strongly towards some event or disaster that will require massive preparations on a national as well as local scale.
Those of us who have met Stuart know he finds brewing Doom Bar a bit of a chore - it's growing massively, it's a routine to brew - and he has a huge imagination. The line from MC is that Stuart "Stays doing what he's doing but supported by more investment in the brewery and greater distribution capability." I'd like to think this means he'll be staying on in the new company, and will be given freedom to experiment, getting some of his Belgian-influenced ales out into the market properly. My mouth also waters at the prospect of collaborations between him and Worthington brewery legend Steve Wellington.
Burdett was a cartographer, surveyor and topographical artist. In 1765 he moved into the tall house on the left hand side of the street (next but one to the alms houses) which he had his friend, the architect Joseph Pickford (1734-1782) remodel in the fashionable Gothick style.
Deck the Halls by Debby Mayne: Lillian Pickard’s family is struggling since her dad’s injury. He hasn’t been able to work and so Lillian is forced to go work at the local Five and Dime to put food on the table. The money doesn’t always stretch far enough so they live on a lot of potatoes and onions. But when wealthy William Tronnier starts paying attention to Lillian her family is wary and warn her away. Is William after only “one thing”? Or is it possible that he’s planning a proposal that she can’t refuse?

The Telegraph quote Amnesty,
Ethical issues can arise when companies must comply with multiple and sometimes conflicting legal or cultural standards, as in the case of multinational companies that operate in countries with varying practices. The question arises, for example, ought a company obey the laws of its home country, or should it follow the less stringent laws of the developing country in which it does business?

Yesterday we drove up the Alaska Highway to Fort St. John. I was leading the ecumenical Good Friday Service at Fort St. John Presbyterian Church. The drive always provides amazing vistas of the South Peace District in British Columbia. On this trip, I was not the driver. As navigator I was able to dictate when to stop for a few pictures. We have had an unusually mild winter. There is precious little snow left. I say ‘precious’ as the way below normal snowfall has the farmers concerned for this summer’s crops.
So, yeah, I'm going to keep writing and blowing off some steam, if you don't mind. And if you do, you can just shut your whore mouth* and turn the channel.

Unfortunately, the episodes of Vampire Knight that I had downloaded were incomplete episodes, so I have to finish downloading and converting them.

The Bible records that sin entered the world through one man, Adam, and death through sin came to all men because all have sinned. (With sin comes not only physical death but death to the eternal soul separated from the presence of God). How much more did God's grace and the gift (eternal life connected back into the presence of God) that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! (Rom. 5: 12-16)

So I was pleasantly surprised by the in medias res opening sequence of Dead Space 2. After a cutscene that establishes multiple conflicts in relatively short order—Isaac is still hallucinating his dead girlfriend, he's being interrogated in some kind of quasi-fascist insane asylum—we're thrust right into the action as an attempt to rescue Isaac is thwarted by a Necromorph outbreak. So we have an unreliable, possibly insane narrator, an implied shady government/corporate conspiracy, and an alien invasion. And who are these people trying to break Isaac out, and why? What's happened to land him in this facility? We're not yet five minutes in and already several conflicts have been established. So far, so good. But then things get interesting.
Sophia was asking me questions about what was going on with Tom and Ellie, and Chris and Lottie. Ellie was obviously going round Tom’s house today, but on the bus they were like a mild version of Chris and Lottie. She kept resting her head on his shoulder, and they were being very solitary. I told Sophia the truth, this, and that they were not officially going out yet, but it was only a matter of time. I also told them everything I knew about Lottie and Chris.Pretty much everyone seems to agree with the idea they have been seeing each other for a long time, while Chris was still with Phoebe. The evidence does look that way. Sophia and people were trying to get Phoebe to go out with this guy at skating, which really didn’t look like it was helping.
In all the entire history of the nation we never once had a prime minister’s wife coming to the fore and adding fuel to the fire. Datuk Seri Najib must deal with this unless you are oblivious to what Tun Dr. Mahathir once mentioned publicly in making reference to your spouse.
After that I went back to Wales for a few days, as novelist Jean Mead had kindly invited me to take part on the Saturday in a book fair she had organised at the Quay Hotel in Deganwy.

Without telling Sunday who he really is, he begins to pursue her as the prince he is. The romance between the two would leave you grinning like a fool. Rumbold is very sweet to Sunday and Sunday has one of the biggest hearts I've seen in most characters lately. Though their feelings seem to be going somewhere, there are still secrets about their families that each of them must uncover in order to move forward.
Blaine in her later years was managed by Rob Cipriano and L’Etoile Talent Agencies in New York City.

Twilight is kind of like a Twinkie. On the one hand, there’s not a lot of substance to it, there’s no real benefits to consuming it, you really shouldn’t think too hard about what’s in it, and most people are kind of embarrassed to admit they like it. And yet, it’s inexplicably delicious. And after consuming one, you kind of feel like the damage has been done, so you may as well go ahead and have another.
We adopted three complementary strategies to test for robustness and generality. First, study 1 tested whether individual differences in the tendency to engage analytic thinking are associated with reduced religious belief. Second, studies 2 to 5 established causation by testing whether various experimental manipulations of analytic processing, induced subtly and implicitly, encourage religious disbelief. . . Third, across studies, we assessed religious belief using diverse measures that focused primarily on belief in and commitment to religiously endorsed supernatural agents. Samples consisted of participants from diverse cultural and religious backgrounds.

He and V have been having so much fun together though it is a learning experience for them both. They are both headstrong and tattle-tellers so we have had a lot of correcting, but it will all work out. They are both 4.5 years old, so what can I expect...really? LOL
Tracking individuals in the US is easily and cost-effectively implemented with NSA’s electronic surveillance network. This network (DOMINT) covers the entire US, involves tens of thousands of NSA personnel, and tracks millions of persons simultaneously . Cost-effective implementation of operations is assured by NSA computer technology designed to minimize operations costs. NSA personnel serve in quasi-public positions in their communities and run cover businesses and legitimate businesses that can inform the intelligence community of persons they would want to track. NSA personnel in the community usually have cover identities such as social workers, lawyers and business owners.

Protein function is controlled by altering their structure in processes that can be independent or inter-related including phosphorylation, ubiquitination and SUMOylation. In the present work it is shown that phosphorylation of kainate receptors on its own promotes their activity. However, phosphorylation also facilitates SUMOylation of kainate receptors that reduces their activity. Thus there is a dynamic and delicate interplay between phosphorylation and SUMOylation that regulates kainate receptor function.
Also, on days when I'm wearing a lot of spackle, I double cleanse. Not by using a fancy Japanese oil like the cool kids, but by using Cetaphil twice. I massage in some Cetaphil, then tissue it off. Then I use more Cetaphil, this time with the Mia.
I am not a skilled baker. Worse, I’m a bachelor. Unsupervised, better equipped at reheating leftovers than creating something as fragile and sophisticated as a tart, I failed to replicate the flavors of the butter tarts I’d read about in the Toronto Star’s article “The art of the tart.” The recipe I used was from a group of sixth-graders. It won first place in a contest. The paper described it as having “a full-flavoured, buttery filling that is neither firm nor runny, in pie bald plain and chocolate pastry shells that are difficult to reproduce.” It’ll say.
Jacob located his brewery near the Big Eddy Springs, from which poured nonacidic, nonalkaline water that the brewery uses without treatment to this day. . . . Water is the key to the brewing process, and most brewers have to treat their water in one way or another in order to make it suitable for brewing. Jacob never seemed to have this problem, and the brewery's water is still of high quality today (The Breweries of Wisconsin, 142.)

So, the girl hosting (don't even get me started on her) got the burnt of a grown "man's" temper tantrum. Hold on, before I continue... I guess I should tell you all about the girl I work with. She's a little, barely 21 year old. She rests a rough 105 pounds on 5'1'' frame. Just a petite post teenager. Sweet kid outside of work, but lazy as hell. She will do anything to worm her way of actually putting in any physical effort around the restaurant. She also does a pretty effective job of getting her shifts covered that might involve working a busy night. So needless to say, I don't exactly respect her. I am also not a big fan of having to work the same shift as her.
I think that begins to tells us volumes about who Jesus is. It begins to show us his character. I don’t think he would have been invited if he were the long faced sourpuss that many equate with a follower of Christ. I also don’t see him as a drunken table-dancing, lampshade wearing life of the party guy either. But I see him as someone wh, because of his nature, earned his way to the top of everyone’s guest list. Why? Because he knew who he was. He didn’t try to impress anyone. He conversed equally well with kings and with prostitutes. He was comfortable in every situation because he always knew what he controlled and what he did not control.

EPO Examiners often focus on the technical effect(s) achieved by the invention. When drafting one should identify all of the technical effects to make sure they are reflected in the specification. For example a new product may have improved activity, but it might also be more stable, easier to make or have fewer side effects. Synergistic effects should in particular be identified and highlighted.

This is a rustic salad, the basic premise of which is to use up stale, leftover bread - I love dishes which come about in this way. The bread is soaked to soften it, then it is crumbled through the salad. In Tessa's recipe she begins by cutting up tomatoes, putting them in a colander, sprinkling with salt, and standing for a while to allow the juice to drain away. She then goes on to soak the bread in water. Why, I thought, soak bread in water when you are draining off all that beautiful, flavourful juice from the tomatoes. "Two birds, one stone" - I drained my tomatoes in a colander set over a bowl containing the bread cubes. Tessa includes celery in her recipe which I omitted, and I added in a few extras - roasted red peppers (wish I'd used yellow actually, just because the colour contrast would have looked prettier), garlic, capers and black olives. I'm sure there are plenty of other things you could put in this, though I would say that bread, tomatoes and basil are the critical ingredients and most importantly, do not even contemplate making this with anything less than tomatoes picked at the height of the season - out of season, hothouse tomatoes will absolutely not do for this.

I blame Facebook, of course. And Twitter. And hypocritically, I am right there on both of them with everyone else. Twitter provides everybody with fabulous linkage and good reading, while Facebook provides the personal stories and socializing; the grease that keeps the online Dharma-wheel turning. What need is there for small-time local blogs? I find it interesting that the most hits I have received in the past year on one post (about 3000), was primarily because it was widely reproduced on Facebook.

Funnily enough just last night I finally found a near on authentic Mexican restaurant in Perth (holy motherfucking shit I am not kidding on that) and I ordered a burrito, forgetting the corn elements of Mexican food in my excitement. What arrived on my plate involved corn. Unavoidable corn. So I had to eat some. I was, surprisingly enough, still alive when I woke up this morning. I still hate it, even if I did have a “this isn’t so bad” thought mid burrito. I think that was the margaritas I’d inhaled talking though.

Enough time-wasting. The point of this series is to pass on the writer's insights into publishing practice that fall out of this venture. Whether the venture will work, I have no idea. I have run a publishing company before, so I'm not a total novice. But it was a long time ago, and my boss was a balloon (orange) and we were publishing very different things, so most of this is new. For one thing, there is no balloon. Perhaps there should be? I'll think about it. After all, I know I can offset the balloons against tax - I've done it before.

In Tompkins Square Park there was a hawk up in a tree relishing pigeon innards, as about thirty people stood around taking photos of it (that's what drew me to the scene to begin with - that, and the way the hawk would occasionally lift its head and cry out, maybe to warn us off, as if we'd be interested in taking the pigeon from it. The cry of a hawk is startling, especially when you hear it right off of Avenue A).

When I got home at 2:35, it was just for a short stint. Things were in place when I got home and Jimmy had even decided to tidy up the house (as much as a 15 year-old who has never been taught to clean can). I was pleasantly surprised… but still suspicious. I needed to run to the store so I picked up my husband’s wallet and went out again. I picked my husband up from church and we headed to the grocery store to buy fixings for dinner.
Brewing operations were carried on in the Meadow Brewery from the foundation of the business, on the above-mentioned properties bought by George Younger, until 1832 when, presumably in view of an expansion in trade, additional and adjoining property was purchased. Property on the west side of Union Street, now the Company's garage, was purchased in 1860, and was used as a beer cellar; as was also a feu, acquired later, at the end of Bank Street, on which site the Alloa War Memorial now stands.

The hustle and bustle of downtown was getting to me, so I went to the Midtown area and the brand new Barnes and Noble at Vanderbilt University – otherwise known as my crack house. However, I passed a sad sight along the way. An entire block was being demolished. Happens all the time, right? Except, this isn’t just any block. It used to be home to Tower Records, a place that I have spent countless hours searching for music, both popular and rare. It is indeed sad to see the record store go away. It reminded me that bookstores are not far behind.

There were differences, of course. That's the way of it. No tattoos. The scars that you carved into your legs and arms on those neurotic nights weren't there. The eyes, slightly concealed behind spectacles, were different. Not the look of a feral dog, but of someone just trying to get where they were going.

Henry realizes his complicity in this manufacturing of an Ireland different than that he'd imagined in peacetime, and this segues in part two into another sort of consulting for a reborn IRA. They use him as a way to invent their own version of a Gaelic, socialist, and 32-County nation whose rhetoric convinces few, but whose manipulation of violence and the response to violence brings him in the 1970s and 1980s into compromise, as his life and those of his loved ones are threatened by blackmail. The IRA advocates as in Henry's early career with its first incarnation the imposition of force--this time to bomb Northern Ireland into republican definitions of freedom.

For the next 12 days I will be ceding control of this blog to The Partridge, who intends (he says) to keep you entertained with topical Tales from the Tree. He professes to be reporting from the front line with “branch-breaking news” and “cutting-hedge journalism”. But he’s a dubious character, so you’d do well not to trust him entirely.

So of course she didn't faint, or panic, even though she was frightened beyond belief. If she'd needed to I'm sure she would've rolled me over into the recovery position, but I negated that necessity myself by sitting up fairly soon after she found me and, well: see above for the rest. Ahead lay a feverish ride in an ambulance with more vomiting of blood (despite appearances in the bathroom, the blood was only coming out of one orifice), and a dreadful few hours in Accident & Emergency, sickness washing over me, sweat falling off of me, hooked up to a chest monitor and a drip, poor Rachel sitting at the end of the bed, helpless and worried and scared.

The past couple of months my family has been interacting on a project that has brought much magic into focus. We walked to California to visit my niece who lives in a San Diego suburb! Now you all know we did not actually physically accomplish this. We had a Healthy Heart walking program. Those of us who wanted to participate wore pedometers and each week reported our steps to headquarters which were tallied into miles and mapped out across the good old USA. This created special interest to those participating and inspired us to walk more than we otherwise would. Each week one of us was granted a Healthy Heart award for major distance accomplishments. You can imagine that my contribution was the bottom of the list every week, but I got two awards! One for participating, that was easy. The other one was for valor above and beyond the call of duty. My numbers were so insignificant that I walked to Dollar General and back when I didn’t even want nor buy anything! My best week was a total of 14 miles. My daughter who was the headmaster each week made an itinerary of the area we covered with pictures of that area which we could download. I appreciated her efforts of an interesting account of each week’s journey. The imaginary antics of each of those participating and the interaction between us was full of magic. Now we are in California so how do we get home? One is going to try for a buddy pass on Delta from his brother. As for me I stated “I am tired, I am going to hitchhike home.” We have one problem. Kay enjoyed our fantasy journey and visit, but has double dared us to make it a reality.

Texas brings Boerne Champion, The Woodlands and Cedar Park. The girls race may be Sarah Andrews to lose at this point as favorite Chelsey Sveinsson has opted to go only to Footlocker.

I lost my iPhone today in unfortunate circumstances. The pain I feel, I am not able to describe *sigh* There was a brief moment of hope when I remembered I had a Blackberry catching dust somewhere waiting to get fixed. So down to the phone shop I went in the hope that I could at least still have a way of making and receiving contact whilst on the go. “We can fix it.” *Sigh of relief* “Come back at 4pm, it’ll be ready then.” *Tears of joy* (Whoever told you men don’t cry, they lied) I went back at 4pm to be told “Sorry, this is a bigger problem than we thought, it’s going to take longer…” How much longer? “Come back on Monday”

I was never a fan of Scooby Doo. This oversized mutt exemplifies some of the worst aspects of the human-pet relationship. He is forced – against his will - to participate in the investigation of various unsolved mysteries by insufferably pretentious children, who fancy themselves to be modern-day Sherlock Holmeses. And his role during these activities is either to amuse these children with buffoonish antics or allow himself to be patronized by them in the most irritating manner. His only constructive contribution appears to be the accidental discovery of one kind of clue or another, which usually occurs when he’s trying to make good his escape from imaginary ghosts or ghouls.

But what if the Holy Bible turns out to be true? What if there is a judgment, a Kingdom of Heaven and a Hell? What if? If you are wrong, you have much more to lose than I do if I am wrong. Christ refers to an awful place “where the worm does not die and the fire is not quenched,” a place of “outer darkness,” where there will be “weeping and gnashing of teeth.” I’ve heard people say that there is a great party going on down there, but somehow it doesn’t sound like a good time to me. I have a friend who despises hot weather and I have always been afraid of darkness. I mean really dark darkness. I panic when I can’t see anything. My friend and I would not do well in Hades, if it is as Jesus described it. I have nothing to lose by believing Christ’s teachings. I will hold on to my faith.

So, 6 months down the line, I had a perfect plan and no progress. I theorised that this was because I was living in a bad economy. I said to myself that I needed more money. I found all sorts of reasons, but never realised that I never left the planning mode. Getting the plan off the paper it’s written on into the actions needed to make it a reality is one of the most difficult things to do, yet funny enough, the simplest! What you do is act. You get up in the morning and start doing the things that you said you would do. You hit a brick wall, turn, find a drill, blast through wall, whatever, as long as it is something. I can guarantee you at the end of the week, the month or the quarter, you will start to see progress.

This recipe caught my eye mainly because of the Halloumi cheese. In case you didn’t know I love Halloumi. Halloumi is a Cypriot sheep’s milk cheese that is special because it cooks rather than melts. Because of this you can grill it or fry it and it doesn’t lose it’s shape. I usually cook my Halloumi slices in a dry pan and then marinade them in olive oil, lemon juice, fresh herbs & spices. You can see the full recipe here.

Set in Los Angeles during the first Persian Gulf War, the Coens weave a decidedly unconventional tale about a man known as The Dude. Jeff "The Dude" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is a laid-back kinda guy, an aging Hippie who spends his days drinking White Russians, smoking pot, and bowling with his buddies — Walter, a bitter Viet Nam veteran, and Donny (Steve Buscemi), a not too-bright surfer. One night, two thugs invade the Dude’s home, rough him up, and urinate on his rug. It seems that they have him confused with another Lebowski, a rich millionaire (David Huddleston) whose young trophy wife Bunny (Tara Reid) owes money all over town. Bummed at having his prized rug ruined, The Dude decides to contact the other Lebowski and in doing so becomes immersed in a very strange, convoluted plot that involves nihilists, a kidnapping, Busby Berkeley dream sequences, British performance artists, and, of course, bowling.
This is an ultra-simple App but it fits in so well with the Queensland curriculum, particularly for children in Prep and Year 1. There are not many interactive features, but instead the authors are emphasising the importance of what I would call “real life interactions”; i.e. interactions with Parents, carers, siblings or others that help make the links between what is happening on a screen and what is happening in the real world. Definitely one for the homework list.

I will admit I thought the sex was well done. I thought it was detailed and erotic. The language is blunt. While Christian was into darker games and erotica, when he realized Ana was a virgin he knew he had to take things slowly with her. The sex he showed her was perhaps a bit unrealistic, I mean really how many women are that responsive the very first time they have sex? Then again maybe we all just had the wrong first lovers...ha ha! I thought it was erotic fantasy.
Lately I've had the idea that if I get up half an hour early, that's half an hour of writing. It increases my writing time by 50%. And that's a lot when life gets busy.
I'm at a crossroads in my spiritual life. As far as I can remember into my childhood, I know that my parents tried to instill religion into my life. They took us to church, Bible camps and Sunday School until I was about ten years old. Then, the hectic lifestyle of them working outside the home six days a week took a toll on us going to Sunday services. It ceased to exist.
What does this have to do with parenting? There are lots of people offering parents advice to ignore our children when they are "throwing tantrums." But think of your child's "throwing a tantrum" as his way of communicating a need to you, just like your bladder communicates the urge to pee.

On the tip of Balboa Peninsula, where multimillion-dollar homes sit snug against the sand and the legendary waves draw crowds of bodysurfers, an unlikely battle is taking shape. At the center are the lawns, lounge chairs, hedges and playground equipment — even a rusty metal shark sculpture — that for years have sprawled out from oceanfront homes onto the public sand. It's all illegal, says the state of California, which has ordered homeowners along some of Orange County's most coveted coastline to rip out the landscaping, sprinklers and all the other upgrades that have crept steadily seaward. The order from the state Coastal Commission reignites the perennial clash between the government and homeowners up and down the coast who have sought to claim the sand next to their homes and, in so doing, given visitors the impression that the public beach is their private backyard.

If you are still not sure if an “exempt listing” is right for you and you are not quite ready to list your home, let me share with you my own story. For the past month I have been working with a wonderful family who is getting their home ready to “go on the market”. It is an “exempt listing” and I have been extensively marketing the house through my personal connections, expansive network and campaiging to the real estate community. In addition, I came across an opportunity in which Fox Business News was reviewing homes for their next news segment regarding “staging”. In short, I submitted my listing for consideration and we were selected for their show. Not only is this great exposure for my listing, it will result in a professionally staged home. Who knows…maybe with the production crew around the house, that “right” buyer may just be driving by.
Allah said that the believers are brotherhood. This verse causes a lot of controversy nowadays. Why? Because some people say: We are going to have a “Global Peace and Unity Conference.” Oh my God, what is this global peace and unity all about? It sounds like some funky rave in the Stratford Rex, or something like that. It’s not talking about that. The Global Peace and Unity they are talking about is how can we establish peace within the Earth, and unity among humanity. You become brothers in humanity. When the verse says the complete opposite of that. It never said the “brothers in humanity,” but rather, it said: “The believers, they are brotherhood.”

Hi all! So it’s summer, which is a huge relief for me, seeing as the weather here in Toronto is finally getting nice, and seeing as I’m finally done with classes and now have some free time and flexibility in my schedule. And so, in order to better take advantage of this new-found freedom of mine, I’ve decided to start a little summer blog series which I’m calling Toronto Café Tour. The basic idea is that throughout the summer I’ll be visiting as many Toronto cafés as I can manage, and posting mini-reviews of each of them here. Not only will this mission give me some initiative and purpose to go out and explore new areas of the city, it will also help me suss out the best places in town to get me some java, as well as the best places to hunker down and do some work—info that you, too, will hopefully appreciate.

In the late 1970s, as a young parent, I became aware of the National Fluoridation News, published in the still largely unknown town of Gravette, Arkansas (pop 2,200). For a very small donation, I received a boxful of back issues by return mail. In addition to this generosity, what surprised me about the NFNews was the high caliber of its content. Most of the non-editorial articles were well referenced and the work of well qualified scientists. This was something of a poser, for as a college biology major, I had been thoroughly schooled in the two Noble Truths of Fluoridation: 1) that fluoride in drinking water would reduce tooth decay by 60-65% and 2) that anyone who disagreed with this view was a fool. Yes, I had seen the movie Dr. Strangelove, and yes, I knew how to read an ADA endorsement on a toothpaste label.
