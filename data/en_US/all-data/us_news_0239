But Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker suggests that Sheen may be entitled to a little sympathy: "My sense is that Charlie Sheen isn’t fully himself right now; to say he’s in denial is putting it in a way he’d object to, well, violently. But rather than reduce him to this week’s joke or demon, a decent alternative might be to try looking at him as someone who requires some compassion."

I'm not sure. For all its eye-popping flourishes, there's a preciousness to Scorsese's kid-pic treatment. Exploring a new niche for the first time, the man who made Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, and The Departed hasn't figured out how to connect emotionally with the adventures, and dilemmas, of his preteen protagonists. (Isabelle is played by Kick-Ass' Chloë Grace Moretz, looking like a junior Ingrid Bergman - she's got the face of a Golden Era star.) The supporting characters - a buffoonish gendarme (Sacha Baron Cohen) obsessed with sending Hugo off to an orphanage, a kindly flower lady (Emily Mortimer), a crumpled bookstore owner (Christopher Lee), and an older Madame and Monsieur whose romantic assignations are thwarted by a testy dachshund - are cartoonish, too cute. Ben Kingsley, wearing a goatee and a look of woe, is Georges Méliès; his film company long ago went bankrupt, the films themselves lost, and now he toils at a toymaker's booth in the train station. It is his discovery of Hugo's father's notebook, with its ingenious, da Vinci-like diagrams of automatons, that sets the story in motion, so to speak.

Sure, Thanksgiving is the celebration of the culinary bounty available in this country. But who says you have to cook to express your gratitude?
Maqui berry: Promoters of this fruit, from the Patagonia region of South America, might win a prize if we were awarding one for hyperbole: Maqui, we read at retailer Herbal Powers, for example, is "a deeply purpled berry like no other berry before" that "thrives in a harsh climate where few would survive" and is consumed by the Mapuche, "the only unconquered Native American Indians in the entire America continent," whose "legendary strength and stamina are largely contributed by drinking a fermented maqui drinks several times daily."

A case in point was the concept — nicely combining ambitious design with a sense of rationality about phasing and cost — submitted by a team of the Santa Monica firm Moore Ruble Yudell, the Mexican architect Enrique Norten and the Dutch landscape office West 8. (This was the only team to give a landscape firm a share of top billing.) Its design calls for a new open-air arrival hall for high-speed and other trains covered in a tall canopy of white tree-like forms that would filter sunlight, collect rainwater and — thanks to solar panels along the top — generate electricity.

• Woodson may be opposed to bringing Stoudemire off the bench, but the numbers say that could be the smart move, wrote Jim Cavan of the "Off the Dribble" blog: "A quick look at the numbers shows that – with the team’s second-leading scorer (Stoudemire) unable to play and Anthony playing primarily at the four – the Knicks’ overall offensive efficiency actually improved, jumping from just over 100 to 109.6 over the last 15 games (as cited above, roughly what it was during Woodson’s first six games)... To put that in perspective, if the Knicks had maintained that clip throughout the year, they would currently be a good point-and-a-half ahead of current N.B.A. leader San Antonio."

First, it would make scheduling a visit to the museum a nightmare for me (since I am four hours from Baltimore). In the past, I have contacted the Poe House, made arrangements with the curator, and taken our bus to its doorstep. Our time is always limited, so having this part of our trip coordinated through a train museum would further complicate matters. As an individual visiting the Poe House, I would rather be able to go as it suits me and not have to wait for some shuttle service.
The procedures usually last only 5-10 minutes each visit, depending on the size of the tattoo. Patients describe the pain in different ways.

You just never know who might be a late bloomer. So far so good but miles to go, it's important for fans as it is with players not to get too up or down day to day. That said there are some very encouraging signs with the makeup of this team and I remain quite upbeat about where we're heading in the next few years and hopefully beyond. The key to continued success is with solid drafting/player acquisition and player development and I like what I've been seeing there. Go Tribe!!"

On the benefits of exercise and menopause: "A reason to keep active is just the endorphins that help you reduce stress. ... I try and do something every day. I understand that's something that's going to be with me for the rest of my life. I have to do that for my body. I'm on the extreme end of what most of your readers are going to get out of this, but I've been at it for so long, and that's why I do what I do. What I see in the general population is that women who are my age that don't exercise, that don't lift weights, that don't walk -- I call them matronly. They tend to look matronly, kind of rounder in the center; they just look like (they have) no shape. I've paid attention to it when I was in my 40s, and maybe that was a little bit of a driving force. I don't do weights, because I just don't, but I do plyometrics, and that's something you can do in your backyard. I go in my back yard and jump and hop; I do lunges. I do that to keep a strong muscle mass because I know that just running isn't going to do that."

A: You want this cable to last quite a while, so Cat 6 Ethernet cable is the stuff to use. You'll see older, cheaper Cat 5e cable around, but it won't handle future high-speed networks. Cat 7 cable is also available, but unnecessary for your needs. Choose PVC cables over plenum-rated cable, as PVC is half the price and will work fine for a home network. Be aware that running network cable isn't an easy task. Running the cable correctly, wiring the wall connectors and testing the system all require special knowledge. I strongly recommend hiring a low-voltage contractor so it's done right the first time.

Before I ran for governor, 10 years, I was a pastor of a congregation. And that role includes not just organizing Sunday services, but caring for the peoples temporal needs as well. I worked with a number of couples and individuals who had lost jobs, who were long-term unemployed, who were about to lose their home, provided funding for them, sometimes personal, more often church resources, provided at the same time counseling for people going through divorces, for individuals who had kids in trouble.

Which, by the way, included people of very substantially different backgrounds.

Niman beef is treated well in the classic carne asada ($18.25), arriving in tender strips grilled to a char on the outside and red-pink juiciness inside. Arbol chiles give the pungent parsley-garlic chimichurri sauce a kick - enough to perk things up but not overpower. Sauteed chard on the side offers an earthy contrast with the sweet potato puree, which tastes of canela, the Mexican brown sugar.
The brothers call all of this a simple setback. Something they will get through. "Failure is not in their vocabulary" is a line from a 2006 magazine profile, and the concept didn't surface during a lengthy interview last week with the Post-Dispatch.

The accessibility and ease of the current methods of communication have their advantages, but the disadvantages seem to be growing. When the "Congratulations!!!" start coming in, most of the time those writing the word haven't spoken recently to the person they are congratulating. There is also the distinct possibility that no true friendship exists. With many people heading into college with more than 1,000 Facebook friends, standards for a friendship have fallen dramatically. Today, if you meet someone for 10 minutes it's fair to assume you will be Facebook friends in a matter of hours.

While Kevin was playing for Coach Flood the only time we ever had an issue is when they kept changing Kevin's position. We understood that it was because Kevin was their best option to move around, as even in the NFL he is proving his versatility but by his senior year, we felt that they now owed it to Kevin to give him his position that he earned and let him play it. As you know, it worked out pretty well. Kevin has nothing but good things to say about coach Flood. And knows that he made it to the league more prepared then most players. All the things that are good about RU football will continue under Coach Flood.

Winterhalter's death is one of more than 20 that have been linked to the use of synthetic drugs, according to the Star Tribune's continuing investigation of the business.

Dear Margo: I'm a dual U.S./U.K. citizen in my late 20s, and I chose to move to America to pursue my career. My brother did the same. For a few years, it was fun, and I wasn't thinking too far ahead, but my brother recently married, establishing real roots over here. My mother is American and would love to come to the States, but my father has such a host of health problems that it would be financially impossible for them to move here. When we were home in England for Christmas, my brother came to me crying one night, upset that once again we were leaving them and saying that when the time comes for him and his wife to have children, our parents will only see them once, twice or three times a year at most. So I guess my problem is this: I love my life over here. I have a good job, friends I love and a boyfriend I can see myself settling down with. Do I give it all up and move back to London? Family should be the most important thing, and I feel guilty I have not prioritized it. My parents have been nothing but supportive and loving my whole life. I know it is a parent's duty to wave their children off into the world, but I don't want to regret anything when they die. I also don't want to give up a wonderful man and the life I've built here. — Confused and Guilty

It's really no surprise that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Senate GOP Whip Jon Kyl walked away from talks that seemed to be making serious progress on the debt and deficit. At some point, the conversation had to turn to raising taxes, which Republicans are loath to do, and restructuring entitlements, which Democrats don't want to do. That stuff's above the pay grade of Cantor, Biden, et al. -- only Obama and House Speaker John Boehner can resolve it. Will they hold hands and jump together, or settle for a small-scale deal that goes only as far as the Biden group could? Guess we'll see whether that golf outing paid off.

The room remains an artful modern-retro mash-up, with green-and-white rolling leather chairs in a library trimmed with modern walnut.

Sherrod Brown said in a discussion of the mental health safety net during an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program. “I mean, the laws were there, but he fell through the system, he fell through the cracks, because he wasn’t identified because when he left the community college, nobody approached him, apparently.”

But forget coal. What about oil? The president killed the Keystone XL pipeline. After the BP oil spill, his administration overruled its own panel of experts to implement a moratorium on offshore drilling (while suggesting it was the experts' idea). Mr. Obama wants to revoke "subsidies" for oil companies, which are in fact the same tax write-offs that any business gets. He takes credit for the increase in oil drilling on U.S. soil but leaves out that drilling on federal and American Indian lands has gone down under his administration. He also forgets to mention that he opposes drilling off the mid-Atlantic coast, the Florida coast, the full Gulf of Mexico, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or in the Rockies.

After trying earlier in the week, Matheny was able Friday to get relievers Scott Linebrink and Kyle McClellan into late-game spots that reflected what each might do during the regular season. Linebrink pitched the seventh with a one-run lead and McClellan handled the eighth with a two-run lead, each bridging a tight game toward that day's closer, Class AAA reliever Victor Marte. Linebrink and McClellan pitched scoreless innings. "We're giving guys opportunities to show what they can do," Matheny said. "There's no sense waiting around. We haven't gone easy on either of them. A lot of times it's easier for a guy to come into a situation that he's accustomed to rather than something completely foreign. Part of it is familiarity. But a lot of it is putting them in a situation that they could be fighting for." ...

That incident drives the rest of the film — allowing everyone to resurrect old gripes and grudges and figure out whom they really love. Most of the tips on the dog's whereabouts come from Carmen (Ayelet Zurer), a clairvoyant gypsy who is the caretaker of the vacation home. There are some nice moments in the mad scramble as the group breaks into teams to search for Freeway, but the dialogue is mostly soggy rather than sharp in the way that would have brought the characters and crisis into more compelling focus.
