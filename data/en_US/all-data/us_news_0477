Decrying the gas tax — as if the levy was the real culprit for high energy prices — has become such a common theme for populist politicians that the public might be forgiven for actually believing it to be true. In reality, Maryland's gas tax has remained unchanged since 1992, when it represented about 21 percent of the cost of a gallon of gasoline. The tax would have to be raised by nearly 50 cents per gallon for that percentage to still hold true today.

isn't enough for this city, here is another deliverer of iced goodness. The frostings on the four varieties I tried were delicious, but the cake part was a bit dry on two of them. The folks running the truck are friendly and enthusiastic, which is always a plus. One cupcake is $3, or $2.50 each if you order four or more. Nothing against either cupcake truck, but I'm not sure there is a cupcake anywhere worth $3.

Koepp's script also had to get the approval of Harrison Ford, who probably enjoyed getting to play his own age in a story set at the height of the Red scare in 1957, when Marshall College's Professor Jones, believe it or not, runs afoul of the FBI and has his patriotism questioned. Though perhaps ambivalent at one time about Indy typecasting, Ford has made his peace with one of his most iconic roles and seeing him at his ease here is like meeting an old friend after years away.

Berman took in $577,000 during the first three months of the year, the period covered by the latest filings. That is more than twice the $202,000 collected by Sherman at the same time. Berman's total fundraising for this election has reached nearly $3 million, while Sherman has added about $1,043,000 to his already considerable campaign fund since the two congressmen's homes were thrown into the 30th Congressional District during last year's redrawing of political maps.

McIlroy twice has reached No. 1 in the world this spring, only for Luke Donald to wrest it away from him last week in New Orleans.

I'm in no way saying that occasional greatness cannot still be found in a $200-plus bottle. I had a 2000 Chateau Palmer last week that was stunning! Palmer, not known to chase trends, produced in this vintage an amazing, balanced and judiciously rich wine. (BTW, it's probably $250 a bottle if you can even find it.) But another Bordeaux, the 2006 Chateau Coufran, while not as great, is pretty darn good. It's also $30 a bottle and much easier to find.

The anger of Sami Hassoun, the man who tried to set off a bomb outside Wrigley Field, could have been overturned had he only followed his daily prescription - face east and prostrate into prayer. This is how Muslims should reconcile their anger - by praying for the salvation of their nation. Not by setting plots to destroy the very cities in which we live. This is the oath I have taken as a Muslim and as a citizen of this country, " . . . to sacrifice my life for the sake of my faith, country, and nation." Sami's actions only fuel the misconceptions about Muslims, and his violent act is not our true practice.
To suggest that things may be more complicated is in no sense to deprecate their commitment. But it is to say that if, proverbially, the first casualty of war is truth, then the first casualty of activism is complexity. If Save Darfur had said, "Look, the situation in Darfur is very convoluted and, while the government of Sudan deserves the lion's share of the blame, the rebels are no prize either," how many contributions would the group have received, and how many volunteers would they have inspired?

REVISED Schedule of Events
Kansas won its eighth straight league title, perhaps obscuring the fact that Self worked with a much-changed team.

The rich, savory characteristics of a well-aged Cabernet bring a stateliness to the holiday table. One, it's a chance to finally open those bottles you've been saving. Two, the mellow aged flavors and more opulent mouthfeel commend themselves to the rich food, but don't overpower it. Cabernet's toasty, beefy notes are perfect for gravy and stuffing.

The other moment was seeing a young, much lankier Faulk gleam across his office television screen saying that he’d come play for LSU, where DiNardo was the head coach from 1995-99.

But all along there have been flecks of darkness here and there. In an introductory scene, the office boss -- played by Gary Norman with arrhythmic speech and a numbed demeanor -- talks about the ethics of killing fish and makes passing reference to war and hard times. And when the slick-haired Mr. Dart (played with unnerving calm by Chris Murray) starts visiting from the central office, the story begins to slither from sit-com territory to something more like last year's acclaimed German film "The Lives of Others." As the mood darkens, Beverly warns Lorraine that "terrible things happen when we are too trusting," and the line resonates throughout the various layers of plot and theme, from romance to national security.

Yet the chemistry between two people isn't just a matter of molecules careening around the brain, dictating feelings like some game of neuro-billiards. Attraction also involves personal history.

Three cheers for the infinitely wise decision to say goodbye to the restaurant's soul-sucking location deep within the Hyatt Regency Hotel and move into a far livelier street-level address at 6th Street and Nicollet Mall. Where the old place took its design cues from a 1930s ocean liner -- or at least a stylized one in a revival of Cole Porter's "Anything Goes" -- the new location's white-and-sapphire setting is less distinctive, looks-wise. It's slick, but soulless, and a tad cramped. But it's on the sidewalk, a vast improvement.

Previously, Miller had offered a public vote of McMillan. But by the time the team convened after the All-Star break, there was more lackluster play.

Now, Bartko is a smart guy. And he assures me the half-court line is there, right at the mid-court, exactly where it should be. "It's down there, you just have to look closely," he said on Friday.
“I haven’t looked at it there closely, I saw it on TV, I saw it live, I saw it on the jumbo-tron once, I thought it was the correct call. You’ve got to keep playing. I like what we had done the previous 42 minutes to think that we could keep pressing forward and keep moving forward in the direction that we needed to. I didn’t sense that there was going to be a let down.”

Finally, ASUS announced the 7.1-inch MeMO, another tablet that ships with Android 3. It's one of a few different high-profile 7-inch Android devices, which can offer two things that the iPad can't: jacket-pocket convenience and a price that's closer to that of an ebook than a notebook. I'd love to see a company do something fresh with this kind of device, or kit it out to do one thing exceptionally well (there's definitely a market for a device that promises to be the best mobile email device anybody can buy). But it's possible that a successful 7-inch slate needs only be an Android 3.0 device, and $250.

About Beer mixed with sparkling lemonade or other citrus soda has long been a worldwide favorite in hot weather. This is A-B's answer to Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy, a MillerCoors product that has grown in popularity since its debut in 2007. • ABV 4.2 percent • Released March 19 • Available Through July; 12-ounce bottles and cans and on draft. • Four-sentence review This is the first new Shock Top variety that has truly impressed me since the original Shock Top Belgian White (pumpkin, raspberry and a new Wheat IPA have been disappointing). Lemonade flavor is there, but it's not overpoweringly sweet or sour. Beer flavor is present, but it's light and without an unpleasant aftertaste. I like this shandy. • Would I drink again? Absolutely. At a backyard barbeque, after mowing the lawn or on a picnic during a bike ride.

With her money market account earning nothing, Johns feels a need to boost return while remaining conservative on her investments, but she's not sure how to do that.

Unlike Corzine, who was stiff and awkward and seen as an outsider, Christie is all Jersey — born and raised.

David Brooks' column "Respect the future" (April4) demonstrates a common tactic for influencing public opinion. He pretends to understand people's lives, beliefs and motives and defines them in a way that supports his preconceived conclusion, which, in this case, is that life should be extended at all costs. While it's true that many people with very difficult lives do everything in their power to put off inevitable death, this doesn't mean it's the right course for everyone. Others may prefer to die rather than linger in a prolonged illness. Neither is particularly noble in and of itself.

I put both my hands out, I grabbed the gun and his wrist and pulled down to get it out of my face. It went off in my lap – my left knee area. The gun dropped on the floor. We both reached for it.

I came up and started pulling the trigger. When I was coming up with the firearm, that’s when he was moving.”

When a BNSF manager admitted it was for gene testing, Avary refused to cooperate and was threatened with being fired for insubordination, according to allegations in the EEOC lawsuit.

The cheers of the young who flocked to the White House and ground zero in New York City late Sunday as word of the death spread were somewhat cathartic. There is a time and a season for celebrating certain deaths. This was that time.
In his ruling, Judge Peter J. Corrigan awarded dealers nearly $800 million in damages and about $1.2 billion in interest. Lowe said the interest levels were so high because some of the sales involved took place 24 years ago.
Ever since, he has been grappling with those questions. Revivalism may come naturally to him, but his execution tends to be deliberate. Sometimes that means he gets a little too self-consciously corny for his own good, as on the 2007 single “Ticks,” the subject of which is best left undiscussed. But usually Paisley’s traditionalism benefits from his thoughtful approach. On “This Is Country Music,” his ninth album, he lays bare his feelings about the musical style that made him a star, and does so in language that’s frank, smart and compassionate.
"I think its a brilliant move by Fox, I think it's groundbreaking,'' said Buck, who is entering his 17th season doing NFL play-by-play for Fox. "There's nothing we concentrate more on going into a season, within a season, than the rules. It's a complicated part of the job for any broadcaster. So to have the guy who is the authority on that ... is invaluable.''

Angela Howard said she could no longer work for Imagine. She wanted to pay her best teachers more money, she said. The budgetary stresses, among other things, were too much.
I've been live-tweeting "The Bachelor." There, I said it. To a lot of people, including my inner circle of friends, my penchant for reality dating programming (and my willingness to document it in real time) makes me exceedingly nerdy. In fact, I suspect that some of my closest buddies hang out with me despite the fact that I like "The Bachelor." But thanks to Twitter, even though I might be sitting on my couch by myself, searching for the show's hash tag and hitting refresh means I never watch an episode solo.
The Argentine World Player of the Year netted twice from the penalty spot and once from open play to help Barca to a 4-1 win at home to Malaga, his 44th, 45th and 46th La Liga goals of the campaign taking his total in all competitions to 68.

CPS workers have some relatively easy calls with neglect, too, such as children found in a meth lab or left alone in a vehicle while a parent drank in a bar. Those cases also could be prosecuted as criminal conduct under state law.
"History bodes that when Cleveland says they can't afford it, Cuyahoga County just does it," Gallagher said.
In the study, researchers added green and white tea extracts - or catechins - to testosterone and tested whether the enzyme that usually detects testosterone in the body could still identify it. Tea seemed to reduce the testosterone concentration by up to 30 percent and appeared to work best when testosterone was only slightly higher than normal. Similar results have been found in rodent studies, Rabin said.

A director at heart: After working for Disney and other theme parks, he got his chance in 1987 to direct a major motion picture, "Masters of the Universe," starring Dolph Lundgren and Frank Langella. He also produced and created several television series, including "Skeleton Warriors" and "Captain Power: The Beginning."
INTANGIBLES: This matchup has produced six straight Ravens wins, but it’s hard to put too much stock in that because only one of them has come with Ryan at the helm of the Jets. It is fair, however, to focus on the Ravens’ home-field advantage. They are 11-1 in their past 12 games at M&T Bank Stadium, and 66-23 there dating back to 2000. Only the New England Patriots have a better home record during that span. But the Jets are obviously battle tested, having played in back-to-back AFC championship games. They also are 15-8 on the road under Ryan. There is plenty of motivation on their side as well after losing to the Ravens, 10-9, in last year’s season opener, and getting publicly challenged by legendary Jets quarterback Joe Namath this week following their loss to Oakland. The sense of urgency should be there as well because after leaving Baltimore, they have a date in New England the following weekend. The Ravens, meanwhile, will enter their bye week.

The I-told-you-so isn't particularly sweet, but we are right where I predicted we would be: in the more-debt-and-demagoguery portion of our program.
"Battle Royale" (2000) is the film and novel to which "Hunger Games" has most often drawn comparisons, but there's little resemblance beyond the teens-forced-to-fight-each-other scenario. The Japanese cult classic boasts some fun and creative violence but ultimately doesn't make a lot of sense. That may be in part because the film diverges enormously from the novel's intriguing dystopian setup: The novel's program of teen carnage is intended to subjugate the population of a totalitarian state; the film's is kind of an extreme juvy hall outing.
This was the spot where three-time Super Bowl champion Dave Dalby died in August 2002. The medical examiner would later say that the former Raiders center had a blood-alcohol level of .15. Friends would reveal that Dalby was struggling with depression and purpose after his football career. A deputy said, "He never hit the brakes."

Fortunately, most people do recover. What is not clear is whether there is a connection between dysfunction and general anesthesia, how to predict those most at risk of a persistent decline in mental function (though age is clearly a factor, as is a previous stroke), and how to prevent it, other than by avoiding the surgical procedure altogether.

Many of us now listen to music, watch TV, and find news in radically new ways, and we aren't going back -- it increasingly strikes us as absurd to buy a CD to get one song, stay home at 9 on Thursday nights because that's when a show is first broadcast, or get our news from a single source. Do we care that our choices have thrown whole industries into chaos? Not in the least -- after years of doing things media companies' way, it's our turn. They'll do it our way, or get replaced.

Mike Doughty wrote some amazing songs on heroin. Luckily, the former Soul Coughing frontman realized his songwriting — and his life — didn’t have much of a future if he remained an addict. “In Soul Coughing, a big part of me would just wake up and think, ‘You know what? I think I’m just going to sniff heroin first thing in the morning every day because I hate being in this band,” he told the Herald last time he was in town. Now clean, sober, solo and still writing amazing songs, Doughty brings his book tour/concert/Q&A session to the Regattabar for two shows tomorrow.

The testing helps in other ways. In the highly transient IPS district, the school is frequently flooded with new students. The tests allow teachers to determine immediately each new student's education level.

It's a defensible position, but the result is an inundation of irresponsible negative advertising, not just on TV but also on the Internet. The ads have made household names of people like Sheldon Adelson and Foster Friess because of their multimillion-dollar cash infusions on behalf of the campaigns of Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, respectively. Nor are they alone. President Obama is being supported by a Democratic super PAC called Priorities USA Action; Mitt Romney is backed by a super PAC called Restore Our Future. The net result is that unprecedented amounts of money are being raised with which to wage political campaigns. This kind of fundraising has more than doubled compared to 2008.

Last year, the Missouri House killed a "reform" (it was "reform" in same way that a house fire is home repair) effort led by Rep. Stan Cox, R-Sedalia. Mr. Cox is back again this year with House Joint Resolution 10, which would re-politicize the judicial selection process. A similar resolution has been introduced in the Senate by Sen. Jim Lembke, R-Lemay. Either measure, if passed by both the House and Senate, would require approval by voters to become law.

Design-conscious friends who live in Vegas suggested Silk Road in the Vdara Hotel at CityCenter for breakfast for its sweeping views of CityCenter's architecture.

My only real complaint in a series of otherwise handsome dinners came when a loin of lamb was unconscionably overcooked. Ordered medium-rare, it arrived with barely a trace of pink, like the Portland sun struggling to emerge from the surrounding darkness. At $36 for the dish, the kitchen needs to keep its eyes assiduously trained on the stove. But, as if in consolation, the lamb is beautifully set off by a springtime offering of favas and English pea shoots.

Round and round it goes, without a crystal-clear answer in the law. Language is necessarily ambiguous. Hence the influence of interpretation. And given the recent partisan divide in the court, it is easy to see this one decided by a 5-4 split. Just like Bush v. Gore. And last year's important gun case (District of Columbia v. Heller) and the campaign-finance case (Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission).

"DRIVERS SEAT" or "FIREWALL" or "MONA LISA."

Rarely, if ever, does a co-opted cash cow return to its rightful pasture. Nevertheless, we urge the state to do the right thing and restore the rightful funding levels.
