The second scene is several years later. My daughter is now a fiercely independent reader, and has sped through the next five Harry Potter books by herself, reading and rereading them faster than I ever could. We decide to splurge on the seventh and final book in the series and each buy a copy, standing in line at a local bookstore to scoop them up at midnight. We rush home to start reading, but the next morning a funny thing happens. My feisty, lovely, half-grown daughter admits to me that the first few chapters have been absolutely heartbreaking, and she doesn't know if she wants to read it alone. Sheepishly she asks, "Would you read it to me?"

"You do have to make sure that it's healed and that the bones are completely fused to each other. But once that occurs, that's not going to break. But once you've had a nerve injury, nerves take a long time to regenerate, if at all, and if you've had a lot of compression on a nerve, you could have some permanent damage. Basically the nerve is the electrical power to the muscle, and sometimes that power gets crimped and it doesn't regenerate all the way. And that's the real issue in terms of recovery."

Then, the game against Boston. We started well, and we were in it the 1st quarter. But personally, I did something to hurt my knee. Actually, it was just an action or movement, where I was guarding Paul Pierce, but when I wanted to jump, I couldn't take off. My knee did something weird, but I didn't know what had happened. I left the court during a stoppage and headed directly to the locker room. I was really, really in pain at the time and that scared me. I told myself, "That's it ... I can't escape the rule." ... The curse of the knee. I had a MRI at 7:30 a.m. We thought that was early, 7:30 ... But, not really. In fact, I was very stressed out, so much so I didn't sleep at all during the night. Suffice to say I had no problem arriving on time. I was hurting, and I was scared. I told myself, "If I'm operated on, I will miss the season, and I won't be playing for the French National Team this summer." All of this was going through my head. I did not have any desire to be operated on at all. I lived through that last year with my shoulder and it was a drag. And yet, with the shoulder, you can remain active on the court, but with a leg injury, you can't do anything. You're stuck at your house.

How to make the Antigua Stiletto
You could get the Optima's good looks for a mere $21,750, which is the delivered price of the nonhybrid version. The argument for buying a gas-only Optima is purely ROI. The conventionally powered Optima, with a direct-injection 2.4-liter, 200-horsepower four-cylinder, already gets pretty great fuel economy (24/35 mpg, city/highway). The Hybrid gets a very respectable 35/40 mpg. In round and nominal numbers, assuming a price-per-gallon of $4, it would take not quite five years to recoup the Optima's hybrid premium.

After roaring at 11 for nearly a half hour, Lee sat down behind a grand piano and dialed the music back a bit. Her near solo performances of “Lost in Paradise” and, later, “My Immortal” were spellbinding. When the band joined Lee, her piano provided the textured that made the performances even more intense. Even after Lee’s piano had been rolled offstage, her playing frequently appeared on the pre-recorded backing tape.

In Los Angeles County, Saddleback Butte State Recreation Area sits atop a granite mountaintop, high above the alluvial plain of Antelope Valley. At the western edge of the Mojave Desert, the 3,000-acre park protects the solitary butte and the oddly shaped Joshua trees scattered across the high desert landscape and boasts vivid spring wildflower displays. Its habitat provides homes for coyote, kit fox, rabbit, snake, lizard, desert tortoise and the dangerous Mojave green rattlesnake. Hiking trails climb the 3,651-foot peak, and a self-guided nature trail focuses on the natural history of the park and area. Campground sites offer shade ramadas.

Marcelo Gomes was burdened with that often thankless role, the hero. Strong of jaw and manly of bearing, the character is well suited to the seasoned Brazilian, and it has been given some comic touches by Ratmansky which Gomes slyly capitalized on. As he's about to walk through a door into Kaschei's menacing world Ivan steels himself, then quickly makes the sign of the cross before the journey. It's simultaneously touching and comic – the hero acknowledging his mortality – and Gomes conveyed the moment nicely.

I didn't attend any of the rallies — not because I didn't want to, but because of my health condition. But I considered it my duty to publicly take a stand and express my opinion. And not long ago, before the election, I said that Putin had been in power for two and de facto three terms and that it was enough and it was time to leave. He is surrounded now by a whole clan which entangles him like an octopus.
Another team reportedly interested in climbing up is the Bills at No. 10, who covet Kalil, according to Charley Casserly of NFL Network. The Bills would be willing to part with their second-round pick, the No. 41st overall, according to the report.

One Dirk Nowitizki fadeaway, one Chris Paul three, one Blake Griffin thunder-dunk may be all it takes to re-light the ignition. By the playoffs in late May, you will need a reminder the lockout ever occurred.
A: I never heard of the case until nine years ago, when I saw an article in The Register about naming a school for Mendez. It was a mind-blowing experience, learning that segregation happened in the town where I grew up. Everything looked different to me after that. The world made sense to me in a very different way.

One leopard was later euthanized, and some of the animals are believed to have been eaten by other escapees.
ZoomCare markets itself as a one-stop shop for illness and injury, as well as preventive, primary and urgent care. Appointments are a flat rate -- $129 if you have insurance and $99 if you don't.

During this year's campaign for the three open school board seats, several challengers have made the need for more transparency an issue, scoring the current board for not engaging the public on important decisions.

Baltimore has never been a hot spot for the headquarters of the nation's largest companies, but it has always had at least one spot on the Fortune list, dating back to its inception in 1955. For much of that time, the city was represented by venerable manufacturers, such as the Martin-Marietta Corp. and Black & Decker. USF&G only appeared briefly on the list before its sale in 1998. Constellation was a Johnny-come-lately to Baltimore. It was created in 1985 as a subsidiary of Baltimore Gas & Electric, which was at the time diversifying into a wide range of side businesses beyond its historical role as a utility. Constellation as we know it now didn't exist until 1999, when the legislature authorized BG&E to create a holding company to help it compete in the state's soon-to-be-deregulated power market. Buttressed by a fast-growing energy trading operation, it moved quickly up the Fortune list.

We of the electorate, the 99 percent if you will, have little to no recourse to voice our displeasure with the way our politicians have managed to create the mess they have in this country.

5. We have praised Missouri's basketball team for its record, its hard work, its unselfish and unified play. But I wanted to mention something that deserves more praise: this is a classy group. It really is. Two things made that perfectly clear in recent days.

Second, when Oklahoma's Steven Pledger missed a 3-point buzzer shot that would have tied Missouri on Monday night, he slumped to the floor -- distraught by the miss. MU's Ricardo Ratliffe and English displayed first-rate sportsmanship and fine decency by walking over to Pledger to help him up and console him. The OU hoops office was so impressed by that, it posted a photo of the scene on Twitter and praised Ratliffe and English.

If you're like most of us, there's probably a good chance you've made fun of a person's middle name at some point in your life. As an adult, such teasing is usually done with a modicum of good-naturedness - as in "Really?

He adds loads of spice to clam chowder (demitasse, $5; cup, $7; bowl, $12), studded with bell peppers, with thin cheese crisps on the side. Subtlety isn't in the repertoire, whether it's shrimp remoulade ($14) with both a mustard sauce and a tartar sauce, escargot ($16) served in a copper pan covered with a thin layer of custard dominated by the anise taste of Herbsaint, or even the fat spears of asparagus ($9) that soak up the smoke of the wood fire like a sponge. The 14 side dishes also include ember-roasted baked potato ($10), and macaroni and cheese ($9), truffled cauliflower ($9) and green beans amandine ($9).

Nighttime in our cozy little bunk meant the hum of constant motion and an occasional flash of light as we barreled through a station. To my ears, the long echo of a train whistle in the dark was no less romantic from the inside. We picked up speed at night; the lost hours in the desert disappeared, and we slid into New Orleans right on schedule. In the morning we'd be on the Crescent north to Philadelphia.

No one is going to turn Karzai into Abraham Lincoln, or Afghanistan into Scarsdale.

Karr's confession last summer was a sudden turn in the decade-old Ramsey killing in Boulder, Colo. But after Karr, a sometime teacher obsessed with the little girl's slaying, was brought back to the U.S., he was freed for lack of corroboration for his claims - or even any solid indication he'd been near Boulder at the time of the killing.
There's some back-and-forth, in which Taymor tells Renard that there's a lot of money being bet on the fights, and Renard will get his "tribute." Renard again tries to pull rank, but Taymor says, "Times have changed, your highness. Royalty ain't what it used to be." Renard pulls his gun and holds it to Taymor's throat, warning him, "in the old days, I would have had you drawn and quartered." But Taymor doesn't back down and insists they're in this together, so he should be careful.
Sam Bradford needs a backup, and the options are dwindling rapidly in free agency, although Dennis Dixon (Pittsburgh) remains under consideration. Could they draft a QB? Possibly. But then the Rams would have two young QBs to groom. Plus, with so many other needs, are they willing to expend one of their eight draft picks on a backup QB?

There are plenty of ways to make butter. The most basic is to fill a jar about half full with cream. Tightly screw a lid onto the jar (canning jars are ideal), then shake vigorously. First it will slosh, then it will seem to turn solid (at which point it's essentially whipped cream), then it will form a lump of butter in liquid.

I had an MRI recently and asked for a copy of the test. Instead of giving me a CD copy, they offered to put it online with a company that would allow me to access my images and share them with my doctors as needed.

* Baseball, of course, tests a team over 162 games. The schedule finds a team's weaknesses and exposes them over the long haul. No, Matt Carpenter won't continue to outhit Pujols. Lynn will have to show that he can still dominate hitters after they've seen him a few times, and make the adjustments. That's the thing about baseball; you have to prove yourself over six months - not two weeks. The Cardinals, as everyone knows, have age in key places and are vulnerable to injury. So the biggest challenges await them.

However, this was a Pyrrhic victory. Far from enhancing the Putin regime's legitimacy, the election diminished it further in the eyes of a significant part of the Russian population. How significant?

Furthermore, 13 percent of the adults polled said they were ready to participate in public protests.
Hey, Greg: They fired one hitting coach and the Ks continue. I think the problem is that the strikeout has become part of the team's culture. For so many years, the front office didn't care about strikeouts and downplayed traditional stats such as batting average. They had Grady Sizemore striking out between 130 and 155 times a year and still called him one of the best players in baseball because of his run production and OPS.
In a series playing out exactly like their previous one, the eighth-seeded Kings have a 2-0 lead on one of the top teams in the NHL. They knocked off the Presidents' Trophy-winning Canucks in the first round and now, with the next two games in Los Angeles, have a chance to close out the No. 2 team in the West without getting on another plane. And they have done it without playing their best for the whole game.

If interest rates rise beyond the Fed's control - because of fears of inflation, or the changing quality of the debt - then the current market value of your bond will fall! You could be "stuck" holding a 10-year government bond paying less than 2 percent when rates rise. If you choose to sell your bond before maturity, you could take a substantial loss. Your $1,000 low-rate bond might have a market value of only $700 if people who have cash could buy a higher-yielding newer $1,000 bond.

The liquid should then be brought to a simmer - slowly, according to most chefs, to maximize flavor extraction; quickly, according to Rodgers. Either way, a gray scum - coagulated protein - will rise to the surface as the water heats and must be rigorously skimmed to produce a clear stock.

Except at interchanges, the plan does not add regular lanes to interstates. There is no guarantee that it would push rail beyond the four-decade-old rail district of Fulton and DeKalb counties. Dreams of a suburban rail system are barely a shadow in the plan, with possible future lines in Gwinnett and Clayton counties receiving only enough money for preliminary work. One proposal could have built a rail line a mile and a half into Cobb, but the construction money was scaled back in order to give more money to roads and to placate some bitter political opposition.

When Al Alburquerque was a rookie last season, he had more strikeouts (67) than innings (43 1/3). That is almost 14 per nine innings. Alburquerque won't pitch for at least a while this season after elbow surgery in December. Perhaps Marte will emerge as this year's version of him -- the reliever who powers out of jams with strikeouts.
The Yankees earlier this month failed to sign Japanese shortstop Hiroyuki Nakajima within 30 days after they won negotiating rights with a high bid of $2.5 million. The 29-year-old Nakajima hit .297 with 16 home runs and 100 RBIs last year with the Seibu Lions, who now retain his rights.
And in the Columbia Basin, coho and Chinook have shown strong returns lately.
In the new environmental assessment, Fish and Wildlife managers argued that not issuing an exemption for harm to polar bears outside the Arctic would lead to a plethora of citizens’ lawsuits which, the agency said, had little chance of prevailing.

The irony is that Jamison has shot the ball rather well since coming to the Cavs. His 3-point percentage and overall shooting percentage is up since his time with the Wizards. Take away his bizarre first game, when he went 0-of-12, and Jamison has shot above 50 percent.

For the physically ambitious, there's a five-day hike into the canyon. (Alarmingly, maps depict an "escape route" halfway along.) Otherwise, it's sundowners — the hallowed safari tradition of a stiff drink at dusk — back at the ranch. We stayed at the eclectic Cañon Lodge, with individual cabins hidden among house-sized boulders (think Flintstones) on the edge of a vast plain. The lodge offers guided walks, friendly staff and a welcome refuge from Kalahari-sized insects that looked serious enough to take down a cat.

Gill was endorsed by Smith and the HCDeadO (Bayonne), placing her on the Hudson Democratic line in the June primary. County Executive Joseph DiVincenzo and company, who are backing Payne Jr., are livid -- at Menendez. So why did Gill get the endorsement? I believe it's because they (Bayonne) were offered the better deal, something instead of nothing. My sources say the Bayonne Dems asked for three things. I can only surmise two and they will probably only get one. O'Donnell will get his old committee seat back, or one better. The request for a seat on a major state agency, say the Turnpike Authority, is too lucrative just to give to "Bayonne."

The Romney campaign's thinking about the electoral map, detailed in interviews this week with top campaign officials and advisers at Boston headquarters, as well as several Republican strategists, is akin to the "3-2-1" strategy authored recently by Bush strategist Karl Rove.

So, in a way, being in St. Louis really didn't matter to us. We could be anywhere. There are a few things we always think about - why this artist, why now and why here. So in that sense, being in St. Louis does matter.

Hill's performance came at the gala's climax, and it was, frankly, a jolt of electricity that the "Small Town, Big Talent" benefit needed.

Although best known as a conductor, Eschenbach began his career as a pianist who had a special feeling for Schubert. His 1970s recordings of the piano sonatas (long, alas, out of print) displayed a hypnotic rhythmic animation that connected the 19th century to modern music. He is also perhaps the finest pianist today that any singer could work with. There is full evidence of that in a profound new Harmonia Mundi recording from Goerne and Eschenbach of Schubert's late song cycle, "Schwanengesang" that adds, as a bonus, Eschenbach's otherworldly performance of Schubert's B-Flat Piano Sonata.

The bill's sponsor, County Councilman Joe Cronin, R-St. Paul, said it was unlikely that he could muster the required five votes on the seven-person council to override the veto.

BECKHAM'S OTHER BIG AT-BAT: He doubled in a run in the third and hit the two-run homer in the seventh. But in the fifth, with two outs and nobody on, he staged a 10-pitch at-bat and singled. That forced Smyly into a 26-pitch inning. He might still have been drained from that when he went out for the sixth because Peavy needed only six pitches to get the Tigers out in the fifth. Then Alexei Ramirez led off the sixth with a line triple to right-center and soon scored the tying run.

It is obvious that at Penn State, loyalty is a one-way street and that the board is comprised of cowards who crushed Coach Joe Paterno's heart, soul and personal honor. Coach Paterno was not an eyewitness to the alleged crime, Jerry Sandusky was not an assistant coach at that time, and Mr. Paterno did notify his superiors with a reasonable expectation that those authorities would discharge their responsibilities.

Anyway, we're celebrating Tom now. On March 3 there will be a benefit for his family at the Local 269 on East Houston Street in Manhattan. Some of Tom's friends and fans, mostly the ones who've gone through bands themselves, will sing and play their favorite Ff songs with a rotating backup band including Ff members past and present. I'm honored to be in that rotation, playing guitar and singing. I thought I was done gigging but for the occasional one-off, and maybe that's still true. But playing Tom's songs has brought me a joy that I have not felt from music in many, many years. It has reminded me how Ff will make you want to play music, they will make you want to write songs. Almost two decades later, their music once again makes me want to be in a band.

In April 1992, coalition members met with Mayor Tom Bradley's administration to discuss what to do about all the liquor stores. Then the not-guilty verdicts came down in the trial of four police officers accused in the beating of Rodney King. The city burned. Dozens of liquor stores were destroyed. Some civic and business leaders pledged to rebuild the city as quickly as possible -- in part by rebuilding the problem stores. The coalition lobbied, demonstrated, cajoled and fought -- and prevented the rebuilding of 150 liquor outlets.

We had a natural camaraderie, but I don't think it had to do with us being women. Women are few and far between in this business, so I thought it was an amazing representation, to be sure. We don't tend to be a group that bonds around our femininity. Most of us are kind of ballsy as ladies go. Maybe that bonds us together.
