In a statement, Daniels said that Mitt Romney has earned our partys nomination and now deserves the support of every American still committed to government that serves the people rather than rules over them. The ruinous debts and anti-enterprise policies of today threaten more than our near-term economy; unaddressed soon, they will end the promise of upward mobility that our nation has always offered to its young and its poor. And they will end the U.S. leadership which has promoted peace and progress around the world for so many decades.

The Blazers not only feature one of the most passionate and loyal fan bases in professional sports, but also an owner who -- while controversially meddlesome -- is determined to build a winner and willing to empty his deep pockets to make it happen. The combination of a lush practice facility and an electric arena -- remember Game 4 of the first-round of the Western Conference playoffs? -- is the envy of many organizations around the league.
At Convention Hall, we got that L train rumble. But that's all we got, and there's a heck of a lot more to Company Flow than menacing sound. The emcees didn't seem to mind the bad mix at ATP, and it's not El-P's style to make demands of the crowd. Like many underground emcees, he leads with self-deprecation. His manifestos are all tucked away in the rhymes. That is not how Public Enemy rolls. This is a hip-hop band with a Minister of Information in it, and Chuck D has made his name by being outspoken and clarifying things for his listeners. He stuck up for Company Flow and all the other word men with "He Got Game," a song that articulates a viewpoint that could be the antithesis of everything All Tomorrow's Parties stands for. "It might feel good/ it might sound a little something," rhymed Chuck, "but damn the game if it ain't saying nothing."

The Conways' farm is one of eight licensed raw goat milk dairies in Washington. They hire no one to help. They process milk and cheese entirely on their own and keep the process immaculate. They sell the Chèvre cheese retail through New Seasons Market, but they sell the milk only from the farm to customers that they interview personally. They also make feta cheese and are developing hard cheeses.
Does Tracy drop Dexter Fowler to second, or eighth, in the lineup, or remove him entirely, as he did last year? Does Tracy change closers again? Does he stick with a starter in the sixth? Does he send in Eric Young Jr. to pinch run, as he did in the first game? When does he pinch hit Jason Giambi? Should he alternate third basemen? Does he call for the sacrifice bunt at Coors Field, which doesn't make sense, or play his left fielder closer to left-center, which does?

"If readers value the quality of news they get from a newspaper site, they should be willing to pay for it," said Elizabeth Brenner, publisher of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which in January started charging people who do not subscribe to its print edition 99 cents a week for access to its Web pages. Papers that have launched paywalls have found that they are attracting audiences that reach beyond the region where they focus their news efforts.
U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Oregon, acknowledged that opposition to the light rail and the planning process caused some bumps along the way.

Alcohol is not sold at the camps, but I learned from veterans that you can arrange at the stables office in Tuolumne Meadows to have the mules haul in your wine (or, presumably, something stiffer) for $5 a bottle.

Chris Korman, reporter/editor: First off, a devastating injury for a jovial, interesting guy. That's tough to see, and while there's going to be some righteous indignation about Terrell Suggs daring to (reportedly) play pickup hoops in the offseason, it's unwarranted. It's perfectly natural for him to use basketball as part of his training. He could have just as easily suffered the same injury doing plyometrics work. Without Suggs, the Ravens' defense will be much more static. Suggs was a big-game, big-play leader. The Ravens play at a different -- championship -- level when Suggs is on (think Pittsburgh.) And certainly they'll miss that. But they also have nobody to even come close to holding Suggs' place on the line. The pressure on second-round pick Courtney Upshaw just increased 100 fold, and new defensive coordinator Dean Pees -- who has been in that spot before -- will need to shape the unit.
As Johnson approached, he said, Authement intercepted him, put his hand on Johnson's chest and pushed him back more than 20 feet. Johnson repeatedly asked if he could check on his neighbor, saying he had permission from a fire official.

So their level of play is going to have to rise and be more consistent than maybe where they were in their previous conference.''

Q.: Thanks for all your efforts on the Cards prospect list. One name in particular that seems to intrigue a few of us and that I'm very interested in hearing more about is Boone Whiting. His strikeout numbers were impressive in 2010, but from what I understand he's more of a control pitcher. Moving up to Quad Cities for 2011, he didn't have quite the same whiff-rate, but still posted impressive numbers holding opponents to a .191 average splitting time between the rotation and 'pen. Because of his size and lack of overpowering stuff, is it safe to assume he is projected out as a starter? Assuming he continues to get (at least some) starts and continues to progress, what kind of track do you expect he will be on?

Summer, you were a blast, but if we have to endure Pitbull's innocuous "Give Me Everything" or the pounding piano of Adele's "Rolling in the Deep" one more time, there could be blood in the streets.

The Browns took linebacker Mike Junkin with the first of the two picks, and center Gregg Rakoczy with the second one. Junkin flopped, and Rakoczy became an average starter for a few years.

But maybe I could imagine it in Naples underneath the frescoed ceiling of the San Carlo, Italy's oldest functioning opera house; at the Charterhouse of San Martino, decorated by the most illustrious Neapolitan Baroque artists; and in the manic, noisy, voluptuous streets of a city that never does anything by half measure. If it's true that certain places have a genius loci — a presiding spirit — then that of Naples is the Baroque.

The Czech Republic saw contraction of 0.1% in the third quarter and 0.3% in the fourth, putting it technically into recession.

At this point I went into full reporter mode. I called Troy Oechsner, New York state deputy superintendent for health, and asked him about my scarcity of coverage options and the high costs associated with them.

In the late 1950s, the state issued a $1,510 check to the Sussex family to compensate them for tearing down structures when 1st Street was built. A State Land Department memo from the time questions whether the family should be paid because they weren't named on the lease for the property.
Secretary of State Robin Carnahan's ballot summary informs voters that the initiative would eliminate individual and corporate income and earnings taxes, and require the legislature to replace them with an expanded sales tax.

There are, to be sure, plenty of stately and studied photographs of the earthquake's aftermath -- an official visual record, as it were, of the city's classical-look ruins. But many also reveal a distinctly modern sensibility, an intimacy and intuition of the chaotic blur of emotions the quake churned up. In one image at the Legion, a young boy thrusts his madly grinning face into the foreground of a shot, taken from Dolores Park, of the smoke-charred sky downtown. In another, a pensive man in a bowler hat leans against a lone burnt timber at Powell and O'Farrell. In a memorable piece at SFMOMA, four men bravely, almost defiantly, await business at a barbershop erected in a field of rubble. Twin American flags affixed to the shedlike shop are thrust backward in a breeze.

But redeveloping a landmark like this in a responsible, respectful and publicly accessible way would be challenging even in good economic times. Someone who cares about history needs to take a more hands-on role in what's coming.

"Banks introduced us to a lawyer who obviously benefited from a client who repeatedly broke the law. And every time they appeared in court, they both got their free publicity. Lohan's whispered 'I love you' to her lawyer is as common a phrase in Hollywood as 'call me,' and Banks' suggestion that it signifies more than just a client-attorney association is as foolish and inane as anything involving Lohan.
Like most young people, she has technique to burn, and she needed it in Shostakovich's Concerto No. 1. For the duration of its 35-minute length, the soloist is playing almost constantly, so her stamina to survive to the end was impressive. So was her negotiation of ultra-high, ultra-soft notes in the first movement, as well as the extreme leaps and runs in the finale and the extended cadenza that preceded it. Never a missed or brushed note, always at the center of the pitch.

As Ben notes, troubling achievement gaps remain. But results from the National Assessment of Education Progress do show tremendous gain, particularly in elementary schools.
The indefatigable VanderMeers, Ann and Jeff (who reviews for our pages from time to time), have assembled another anthology of some of the most interesting fantasist-fabulists writing today, such as Holly Black, Ted Chiang, Garth Nix, Carrie Vaughn and Naomi Novik. The conceit is that each story and illustration contributes — like shards from a shattered mirror — to our understanding of the late Dr. Thackery T. Lambshead, an exquisite, esoteric (and non-existent) collector nonpareil. Thus, illustrations by artists including "Hellboy's" Mike Mignola give us his contraptions like the clockroach — a steam-powered machine "that looked like a big bug, or a lobster, or something," Cherie Priest explains — and stories like Jeffrey Ford's "Relic," which pay homage to the bizarre, visceral curiosities Lambshead collected. In Ford's case, a holy item happens to be "a dark lumpen object, its skin like that of an overripe banana. There were toes and even orange, shattered toenails." It's enough to make you go "Yecch," but in a good way.

She also visited Maugeri Farms in Woolwich Township, touring acres upon acres of fields planted with tomatoes, eggplant, peppers and zucchini. The farm was founded in 1928 by Salvatore and Alfia Maugeri, newcomers from Catania, Sicily.

But they are nevertheless concerned that the spectacle of litigants with pressing business before the court pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into the campaign coffers of justices who decide such business might encourage the perception that the judiciary is for sale, in the way that watching a dog roll around in a mud puddle may lead to the perception that the dog is in danger of getting, you know, dirty.

Her team would finish the regular season 21-19, losing two of its last three matches (to Scottsdale Desert Mountain and Phoenix Pinnacle). But in the Class 5A Division II state semifinals against No. 1 Tucson Ironwood Ridge, Horizon came back from a two-game deficit and held off Ironwood Ridge from four match-point opportunities to win in five games. Horizon would then defeat Desert Mountain in the title match, again in a five-game comeback to complete an improbable championship run and season.

Sometimes I'm really wrong. Like with Rick Scott. Early this year, I scoffed at readers who asked me if Scott had any chance of winning. I mistakenly thought the fact that he ran a company that stole from taxpayers would be an impediment. In fact, on May 6, when a worried supporter of Bill McCollum came calling, I wrote: " ...if Scott gains any traction, his competitors shouldn't have to do much more than point to his track record to effectively wipe out his chances." Not.

3. THE DENVER UKEFEST WITH JAKE SHIMABUKURO, NELLIE MCKAY, ALDRINE GUERRERO: What started as a modest festival a few years ago has exploded into a powder keg of a catalyst. Yes, the ukulele is taking over Denver — from rock bands employing the tiny, simple instrument to entire families learning how to play the four-stringer. The acoustic enthusiasts at Swallow Hill are leading the charge with their many classes and this full-weekend event, which boasts its biggest-ever lineup this summer.

Surgery for spinal stenosis involves making more space in the canal by removing the arthritis accumulation. This frequently involves an operation called a laminectomy, in which the roof over the canal and the underlying arthritis is removed. In some instances, a fusion, which entails growing adjacent vertebrae together with bone graft, is also performed. This is done when there is malalignment of the spine, excessive motion of the spine, or back pain originating from the area where the laminectomy is performed. Screws and rods may be used to help achieve a fusion. Surgery should be considered when standing, walking or lying flat and sleeping is so limited by spinal stenosis that it significantly interferes with a person's quality of life. The surgery stands an excellent chance of reducing the symptoms and improving a person's ability to stand, walk and sleep without pain or weakness. Rarely, bowel and bladder control can be affected by stenosis. In those cases, surgery is indicated to prevent further loss of function.

Many cities never allow waivers, though it's not unusual for a city to set up two permit pricing scales — one for for-profit companies running festivals and one for nonprofits.

The sad fact is that after nearly four decades, we have not purged our politics of big donations nor cured public concerns about the excessive influence of the wealthy. Nor have we enhanced the trust factor of our elected leaders. In fact, it has gone the other way. Cynicism has deepened about our political system. But what we can say is that additional funding has changed races that would otherwise not have been competitive. And what is the alternative? Direct government funding of political campaigns, when incumbent legislators would be writing the campaign finance rules? Or requiring television companies to offer certain free time to the parties, as is done in Britain with party political broadcasts that are not very popular?

Why it makes sense: This seems to be an ideal marriage for Manning aesthetically in that it’s not a major media market, it’s on the opposite end of the country from his brother and the Seahawks have a flexible, defensive-minded coach that could give Manning the freedom he needs to operate.

Plus, the Seahawks are extremely comfortable as far as cap space goes.

Larry "Boogey Doe" Ross, 27, of Cleveland: Trial begins Wednesday on charges of aggravated robbery, kidnapping, grand theft, petty theft, felonious assault, criminal damaging, having a gun after a felony conviction and tamping with evidence. He's accused of stealing a van April 11, finding a 16-year-old boy inside and ordering him at gunpoint to take off his pants to check them for a weapon. Ross and codefendant Duane Chisholm, 52, of Cleveland, drove away before forcing the teen out, leading police on a chase and hitting a house, Russo said. The suspects jumped out of the van and ran. Ross shot at an officer before he was found under a porch, Russo said. Chisholm was found in a garage. He pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery, kidnapping, theft of a motor vehicle and having a gun after a felony conviction and agreed to testify at Ross' trial.

Unfortunately, Jennings didn't inherit his father's thick bass drawl. He's handicapped by a thin voice. Even so, Jennings successfully sold his current single "The Deed and the Dollar," a wry love song in the tradition of John Prine. Jennings' blasphemous demand that Jesus "turn my water into wine" on "Manifesto No. 4" resonated with the party-minded audience. A rendition of "Some Rowdy Women" was similarly suitable to the tenor of the evening. Jennings was most animated while delivering material that railed against the mainstream music that originates in Nashville. "Outlaw You," for instance, defended his father's reputation and decried the pop elements that dominate the contemporary country scene.

Great Lakes cleanup: This is one area where the bad news might not be all that bad, said Jeff Skelding, director of Healing Our Waters, a coalition of conservationists, businesses and others at the forefront of the government-funded cleanup. That's because even if the cleanup program has to absorb as much as a 10 percent cut, that's smaller than a number of other environmental programs have faced in recent years, Skelding said. It received $300 million annually in each of the last two years, while other programs lost all their federal funding.

The cause or causes of the Permian extinction remain a mystery. Among the hypotheses are a devastating asteroid strike, as in the Cretaceous extinction; a catastrophic volcanic eruption; and a welling-up of oxygen-depleted water from the depths of the oceans. Now, painstaking analyses of fossils from the period point to a different way to think about the problem. And at the same time, they are providing startling new clues to the behavior of modern marine life and its future.

Four musicians perform the sonic backdrop for "Ritmos," led by composer and vocalist Tote Gira, who led the audience in several songs of sing-along call and response. But some of the playing, particularly the percussion, sounded ragged, and the songs that were performed before the curtain went up on each act felt like padding to mask that there was barely more than an hour's worth of material on stage. With a little more heart in the work, perhaps that would have been enough.

If the Rams continue to embarrass themselves, if the losses continue to pile up, if the coach continues to make questionable in-game decisions, then we'd have to assume the owner's urge to give Spags a break will fade. Kroenke won't be able to rehab the coach's image/credibility in a way that satisfies an angry fan base. In that scenario, retaining the HC would be awful for ticket sales for 2012.

Investors have been particularly spooked by the Sunday election in Greece, which resulted in a split Parliament with no party likely to be able to form a government. The two parties that governed as a coalition for the past six months were pummeled to the benefit of more extreme parties of the right and left. The socialist Pasok party suffered the biggest retreat. Its share of the vote collapsed from around 43 percent in the last election in 2009 to a little over 13 percent.
