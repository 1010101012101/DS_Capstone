Indeed, Linsanity has fizzled a bit in recent weeks, especially after the Knicks lost six games in a row and Lin appeared to be struggling after the return of Carmelo Anthony. Since the resignation of Knicks coach Mike D’Antoni last week, the team has won its last three games.
The Arcadia salad ($9), named for the restaurant's surrounding neighborhood, is a bowl of flavorful mixed greens (no iceberg!), crispy apple slivers, cranberries, whole pecans and crumbled blue cheese tossed in a not-too-much citrus vinaigrette. I consider blue cheese to be an enemy of the people, but if you're sharing, the kitchen will put it in a little cup on the side so that those who want to inflict pain upon themselves can do so while your palate retains its integrity.

At festivities in Beverly Hills, Calif., in the same space where the Golden Globes are handed out, "Glee" was also honored as outstanding new program, and Jane Lynch (Sue Sylvester) was cited for individual achievement in comedy. Creator Ryan Murphy picked up the "Glee" prizes; Lynch was ill and couldn't attend, but Ian Brennan who writes most of her material, spoke for her when he delivered some lines we'll be hearing from Sue this season. (Included: "A female football coach is like a male nurse. It's a sin against nature.")
The Court of Appeals decision left open the possibility that DNA samples can be collected after an arrest for the purpose of correctly identifying a suspect.
But that hasn't been the case here. Making all allowance for the automobile tramp and others of his kind who have come here, the person who has unpacked and stayed usually has had a pile. Sometimes it has been a big pile, for a great deal of wealth is visible: I hope I haven't given you the idea that everybody here is just one jump ahead of the sheriff. Oftener it has been a little pile, but anyhow it has been some kind of pile. The typical settler here has made what some walk of life regards as a success, and is here to enjoy the climate; that means that he is a person of some substance. Whatever he does after he gets here, the original ability is there; it is trans-mitted to his children, and it is something to be reckoned with.

Like his skirmish with a powerful president, Tancredo's entry in the governor's race in July as a candidate for a tiny third party carries the hallmarks that have defined his career: spoiling for a fight; a willingness to push the edge of conventional political wisdom; and an outright confrontation with the party he served in for almost 30 years.
Indeed, it's music that's good for the soul. And that's why, even at 92, Dangelo is still booking gigs around town. Because he's not the only one who gets a flood of memories when the band begins to play - seniors throughout Rockford gather to hear his tunes from days gone by as well.
many folks need permission to be angry at God. Scripture is filled with examples of people who felt as though God gave them the raw deal. Again, I often remind folks that lament is a type of prayer. Anger is healthy, but too often we let emotions boil over into destructive rage. Letting God know we are angry sometimes clears

“… Tragically, contrary to Superintendent (Joe) Farley’s promise to San Clemente High School football parents to be ‘ultra-fair’ and ‘ultra-empathetic’ to those affected by the district’s investigation, several former colleagues of Superintendent Farley are prepared to testify under oath respective to his personal animosity and professional hostility towards interscholastic athletics and coaches alike and a history of exploiting opportunities to ‘make examples’ and carry out ‘vendettas’ against public high school coaches like Dr. Eric Patton.”
Of the myriad miscalculations made by Mr. Obama, among the most fateful has to be his assumption that a repudiation of George W. Bush was synonymous with a repudiation of conservatism. By Election Day in 2008, Mr. Bush's approval rating was at 25 percent. You cannot get that low without losing a sizable slice of your base, particularly when self-described conservatives outnumber self-described liberals by roughly 2 to 1. It was their opposition to Mr. Bush's big-government conservatism that made them the feedstock of the "tea parties."

For him, and for the country, the meeting symbolizes crucial years of achievement. South Korea was the first Asian nation and the first nation not in the Group of 7 so honored. It was the first former aid recipient to become an aid donor within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Once poorer than Communist North Korea, it now has the world's 13th-largest economy. When South Korea was chosen as the G-20 host, Lee said that the country's years of passivity in international society was at an end.

The Justice Department had imposed some conditions on earlier deals -- for example, pressuring United and Continental to give Southwest gates at Newark, N.J. It didn't do that in Southwest's case.

Here is my dedicated and powerful yoga student. She is also going through a massive transition, a real dark night of the soul, questioning everything she thought she knew and exploding nearly all of it, as she lets her former identity slough away like rusted armor. It's a complete spiritual/career/perspective overhaul of who she is and what she wants to do in this life, which all sounds wonderful and healthy and positive, were it not for the headaches and the sleepless nights and the screaming.

"I think that to say some guys are bold ­ guys aren't going to have a hang-dog look and say "Well, we might win." Guys are confident that we're going to win," Reese said. "I think all players in the National Football League do that, I just think it"s over-exaggerated."
Even before the shortfall was found, lawmakers were considering how to recoup more than $600 million in overpayments to most of the state's counties. While local governments enact local option income taxes, the state collects the tax and redistributes the proceeds based on a series of formulas. This process produces a long lag time -- up to 18 months -- between when the tax is collected and when it's actually received. That is enough time for economic conditions to change considerably and cause the distributions to vary widely from actual tax collections.

A report this month from the Government Accountability Office suggested one way the database still needs tweaking: making sure products are sufficiently identified in incident reports. A recent amendment to the 2008 law requires the CPSC to obtain a model number, serial number, or photograph of the product; before the amendment, the CPSC had asked for model or serial numbers, but the information was optional, the GAO said.

See if your cellular carrier has an acceptable plan. AT&T, Verizon and others offer global roaming plans that require a monthly fee but give you reduced rates. Those rates, however, can still be expensive. Instead of $1.39 in France, for example, you might pay 99 cents a minute for voice calls.

They love teaching the fundamentals of the game, and they dont realize that (in the NBA) after training camp theres going to be very little of that, its going to be mostly walkthroughs.

(On weighing immediate needs versus how good a player at another position might be in the future)- "That's a tough one. It's probably easier said. Where we are picking, especially the first pick, it's probably not going to come down to that, most likely, but it might. When you are sitting there at, let's say #22, you have to stay close to your board. You are going to make a mistake. You are going to make a mistake if you do that. You can say, 'Well it's a need.' You can draft that need and that guy is not going to be good enough. You can't stray from what you think about the player just because of a perceived need. You can ask every personnel guy in the league and that's where the mistakes are made. You think you have to have this guy and you take a guy that's not good enough and you basically blow that pick, you are still looking for that same position and you don't pick a good player. To answer your question, yes, in a perfect world, we'd draft a good player at a need position. If it came down to it, it has to be the player over the need."

With the Rams trailing 1-0, Andrew Velazquez was hit by a pitch and then stole second. Ryan Mahoney hit an RBI single to bring him in and came around to score one batter later on an error by Joe Colon to give Fordham a 2-1 lead.

At first blush, most farmers would consider that unacceptable, said Michel Cavigelli, a soil scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Beltsville, Md., who was not involved in the study.

The girl, the kid’s hottie Gypsy mom, is played by Violante Placido (see what I mean about budget cuts? They couldn’t even afford Eva Mendes again). The paternity of the boy is unclear until Johnny figures it out for us, telling her, “You’re the Devil’s baby mama.” A mild and uninteresting villain working for the Devil, Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth) is also in pursuit, but he has no supernatural powers so it isn’t much of a fight when Ghost Rider shows up and shares his hellfire halitosis with Carrigan’s henchmen until their heads explode. Far too late in the story, Carrigan turns into a demon himself, a creep with the power to make everything he touches crumble to dust (nothing can survive his touch except a Twinkie, a gag that is the only funny one in the film). But his big scenes of mass corrosion merely add to the general sense of rust and decay about the production.

Dear Margo: I'm a 27-year-old woman trapped in a loveless marriage. My husband is younger than I am by a few years, and he's very co-dependent. Before he started dating me, he had never had a girlfriend or a sexual encounter. I, on the other hand, came to the relationship with a child from a failed relationship and a whole lot of trust and fear issues from an abusive ex. Since we've been married, my husband has become verbally, sexually and, to a lesser degree, physically abusive, to the point of laying a hand on my 5-year-old-son. I threw him out for that, but caved to pressure from my family to take him back; they deem him a "stabilizing" force in my life. They think our relationship has caused me to "settle down" and be more responsible. But they do not grasp the abuse I suffered previously, and if I so much as mention that something frightens me, they tell me I'm lying about it for attention. My husband has left for basic training with the army and will be gone for a few months. Although it's only been two weeks, I feel freer, lighter and better able to cope with things. But if I leave him while he's away at training, the social and family repercussions could be devastating, and my son and I may be forced to relocate. I'm so torn and afraid. I only went through with the wedding to please my family, as the abuse started just before the wedding. — A Canadian

Casey looked at the Cornell contraption and reasoned, "During World War II Cornell examined airplane crashes trying to improve the survivability of pilots getting shot down. After World War II they began to apply those methods to automobile crashes. They were really the first to do scientific experiments on automobile crashes: developing dummies, slow motion photography,-all to reduce injuries. The research showed a few simple things we still apply today: if you want to reduce injuries in a crash, make the passenger compartment in tact as much as possible. Let the front and rear get smashed in, keep the doors closed so that people don't fly out. Keep people fastened in their seats, so when the car stops people stop at the same time. Keep the steering wheel from being shoved back into a driver's chest. Here, the steering wheel was in the middle so the driver would be kept away from the edges of the car.

By any measure, Brennan belongs on that list of war-affected soldiers who took their own lives.

Investors were a lot happier earlier this week, when they sent the Dow to its highest close since December 2007.
"A lot of people wouldn’t understand this," says Lee, "but of all the things we ever did, being able to put my grandmother in a position where she wouldn’t have to work anymore — that’s the thing I’m proudest of. She did so much for me when I was growing up. The first time she saw us perform was at a show at Ellis Island, and I looked out in the audience, and there were tears in her eyes."
Pierre Laclede's charming, old building feels lived in and features lots of brick and wood, with tables and seating areas sprinkled throughout. And a bar on the dance floor makes it easy to fill up your cup and get your money's worth all night long.

Gunfire echoed across Bamako as Malian government troops battled each other, killing at least 12 people. Mali's coup leaders who took power over a month ago and ostensibly handed control over to an interim civilian government on April 12, said they control the state broadcaster, the airport and a military base, fending off attacks by opposing forces.

An underrated beer from an underrated brewery, Odell Red pours a pretty shade of ruby and greets the nose with citrus and pine scents from its American hops.

Consider Smith a "quarterback whisperer" -- while at South Florida, he turned signal-caller Matt Grothe into the Big East rookie of the year.

Days later, in a refugee camp on the outskirts of Antakya, in a tent city a stone's throw from their tormented homeland, ordinary Syrians reiterate the same message.

A: I didn't. Ferrell and I still had the dot-com collapse in our heads. The hype around it had gotten so dumb. But the guy who brought the idea to us, Mark Kvamme (of the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital), he had already adjusted. He knew you didn't launch a site like this the way you might have in 1998. It boiled down to, what do we have to lose? None of us, me or Will or Chris, put our money into it. Worst-case scenario, we have an outlet for the stuff we did on "SNL" and it gets 50,000 hits a month. If it was a failure, it wouldn't be a hyped failure. Which is what resonated. It was clearly for the fun of it, and people liked the spontaneity of it.

But Chardonnay is increasingly being made in a lovely, balanced, acid/tart, moderately ripe style with toned-down oak. The trend is to make Chards that work with food and don't cascade you with a luscious, creamy, smoky pile of goo. This is a good thing.

White Burgundies, with the stunning 2009 vintage to showcase, are found on more tables, and the great Chard houses of California are matching the effort. So if you've moved away from Chardonnay in the past decade, consider going back. It's a worthwhile trip, and here are some enjoyable ways to take it.

Sawadee, 137 Newark Ave., Jersey City; (201) 433-0888. The city’s best Thai restaurant is a striking space, with muted lighting, fresh orchids at every table, Buddhas in backlit niches and local artwork on display (kind of Cubist-Surrealist one week, Monet-ish the next). You’d never guess it was a former shoe store. Favorite dishes: the jungle curry; the spicy lemongrass with onions, bamboo shoots, string beans, bell peppers and choice of meat or fish; tom yum hot pot or Crying Tiger, a spicy beef salad enlivened with sesame, onions, bamboo shoots, tomatoes and scallions.

The glass arrived at the table with a giant lipstick stain on the rim. We sent it back. No big deal. It was dark in there, they were busy and, hey, clean stemware is overrated.

Conceptualism is the primary lingua franca of art today — like it or not, and for good or ill. Sixty artists couldn't scratch the surface of its four-decade history. It operates the way Cubism did a century ago, its simultaneity of multiple viewpoints having given birth to Dada in the 'teens and Surrealism in the '20s and dominated the 20th century's first half. Now, Conceptual art even drives the materials of painting and sculpture that it once seemed poised to dissolve.

The latest cuts, to be aired at a hearing next Wednesday, are hardly subtle. They include elimination of the MAX free rail zone downtown -- a step that completes the dismantling of the once-remarkable Fareless Square, following last year's elimination of free bus rides in it.

Chmura makes a good -- and, in better times, decisive -- case for replacing the 35-year-old building with a better designed structure that he says would cost roughly $16 million.

Moreover, just as AQSL built its mythology on its anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan, so has AQAP based its own narrative, in part, on its members' experiences in the crucible of detention at Guantanamo Bay, a key rhetorical tool and recruiting avenue for AQAP. For example, the October 2010 edition of Inspire featured articles about two members' experiences at the detention facility. AQAP deputy emir Said al-Shihri and religious figure Ibrahim al-Rubaish are former Guantanamo detainees, as was Muhammad al-Awfi, who surrendered to Saudi authorities after becoming an AQAP military commander.

potentially devastating future of Steve Spagnuolo's defensive line. Remember, Spags rose to fame as defensive coordinator with the Giants, when the team's top-ranked Defensive Hogs sparked a shocking upset of the unbeaten Patriots in Super Bowl XLI. He's building a similar unit in St. Louis. We chronicled the incredible rise of the Rams' Defensive Hogs under Spagnuolo before the draft: They were dead last on our Defensive Hog Index in 2009; they were No. 7 in 2010. But the coach isn't satisfied: He grabbed talented pass rusher Robert Quinn with the No. 14 overall pick, telling the football world he intends to win again with a dominant D-line. What I didn't like: The offensive line is going to need some love sooner or later -- and they got none in the 2011 draft. The Rams averaged just 3.68 YPA on the ground last year -- only the Bengals ran less effectively. So St. Louis picked up a stud running back and road grader on the offensive line, right? Wrong. Not one player at either position. The Rams might be dominant on defense, but Sam Bradford might still struggle to find a groove behind a pretty poor OL."
