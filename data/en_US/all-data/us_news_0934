My patience with this issue ran out last month. I went to a local Verizon store and told the nice salesman, Jason, that I wasn't leaving until the mysterious, recurring $1.99 "data usage" charge was resolved.

Swagerty struck out Cox both of the times he faced him way back during the NCAA season at the Super Regional in Tempe, Ariz. The first time, though, it took a pitch Swagerty doesn't usually throw. I spoke with the righthander -- and Cardinals' 2010 draft pick -- on Tuesday, and he took me through the at-bat. He got ahead on Cox 0-2 with the fastball. Cox didn't bite on the slider and battled back to make the count, 3-2. Cox saw everything he had, Swagerty explained, so he uncorked a backdoor curveball to K him.

Quakes fans might be delirious over their team's best start (4-1-0) since 2003 but that's not all. They also are enjoying the transgressions down south where the free-spending Galaxy has discovered all that high-priced talent doesn't necessarily equal success. Rumors of locker room strife involving David Beckham only add to the delicious Hollywood intrigue.
"Within a 25-mile radius of here is a million people. When you take the band out to 75 miles or 80 miles, when you get to New York, it goes to 17.2 million people. So there's so many in that North Jersey/New York area that we are expecting about half the business to come from there."

''I'm 31 so that was like 26 years ago. I think that for the five year old watching MTV right now Lady Gaga is going to be an iconic person. In 20 years, the people who are here and talking to journalists will be like, 'Oh Lady Gaga changed my life, Nicki Minaj changed my life.' They'll be saying who influenced them and it will be Lady Gaga, Nicki Minaj, artists like that. I don't think it's as relevant when a 31-year-old is saying the same things.''

Damn, this is a good song. Does everybody realize what a good song this is, or has Swift's massive popularity occluded her talent for those who don't want to believe that a favorite of teenage girls could also be a stellar writer? Remember that it was the teenage girls who picked up on the Beatles first, and the Stones, too. It was only later that the obsessors and collectors crowded the teenage girls out. I'm in the mood to say that it's the teenage girls who recognize all the good stuff first, and tip off guys like me, who pontificate about it and drive all the girls out of the room. Sorry, girls.
Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly play grown men forced to move in together when their respective mother and father get married, and while the premise is amusingly self-critical, the jokes are snappish and crude in the most predictable ways. The double-disc DVD and Blu-ray editions are more inspired, adding more than an hour of alternate scenes and a commentary track sung by director Adam McKay, Ferrell and Reilly over live Jon Brion accompaniment.
What this means to me is students would be required to wear clothes that the school district decides are appropriate. This is a form of dictatorship and takes away our right to freedom of choice and expression.

What I'm not saying is that Christianity should be disengaged from politics. In fact, the early Christian movement was born in politics, in oppositional circles within Judaism fighting Roman oppression. There is great debate over how to understand the relationship between Jesus' spirituality and his approach to politics, but his preaching clearly challenged the powers-that-be. He was, after all, crucified.

6) The Wolfman: Curse of Talbot Hall -- The mazes in Universal's year-round House of Horrors attraction always seem like an afterthought at Horror Nights and this year is no different. The Wolfman maze based on the 2010 remake of the 1941 classic does little if anything to improve upon the same old, lame old House of Horrors routine. I let a group of screaming girls literally afraid of their own reflection in the mirrored hallway go ahead of me just for the entertainment value. The pathetic theming of the maze consisted of sticking half a dozen wolfmen in the mad-scientist laboratory. Save this one for last and skip it all together if you're running short on time.

Scottsdale is such a special place and often I think some people take that for granted. As someone who travels the Valley overseeing all 18 community Republics, I'm amazed at what Scottsdale perceives as problems.

Obama will not win another term stressing his accomplishments, which consist of an unpopular health-care law, a failed stimulus and an anemic recovery. So Obama’s campaign must be relentlessly negative, decrying the Republican nominee’s "extremism."

News reports. The New York Daily News actually uncovered the suit, in which Frances Lawrencina Anderson asks that Soderbergh be legally declared the father of her now 5-month-old daughter Pearl, and that he pay for Anderson's health insurance and child support as Anderson "is without sufficient resources to provide for the child."

LB Jacquian Williams. I think fumble recoveries are an overrated stat and the result of luck at times. But not when they’re one-handed catches while getting blocked. Big play by the rookie. My one qualm: he just missed a sack later on and looked like he could’ve had a shot at the ball.
His committee still must calculate whether the conservative O'Donnell, who is being hammered with questions about misstatements and inconsistencies in her background, can defeat county executive Chris Coons and win a Democratic-held seat in a state where the Democrats have the edge in voter registration.

The nationwide telephone survey of 814 nationwide voters by Public Policy Polling was taken May 5-8, before Trump announced that he won't seek the White House. The poll assumed that President Barack Obama wasn't running and Kucinich (who has also said he won't run for president) improbably snagged the Democratic nomination. Under that scenario, it found Kucinich would top Palin, 43-36, and Trump, 40-36.

It does seem odd that Random House -- which publishes Rushdie, a man made famous well beyond literary circles by the fatwa against him, and Nobel Laureate Orhan Pamuk, who regularly receives death threats in his native Turkey -- would balk at a novel that, from the excerpts, seemed an un-serious piece of literature about Islam. The obvious comparison is with the controversial Danish cartoons of Muhammad, but here critics and pundits were weighing in on a work that almost no one had seen. So what exactly is the book like?
"You saw him in practice a little bit rusty, and then he'd fix some errors," Shurmur said. "Then he got an opportunity to go in and be pretty efficient in the first preseason game.

I'm just calling to make a point about those firefighters they caught on the front of the paper collecting disability, and they're skiing and taking karate classes. If I was collecting disability insurance and I was on my roof shingling my roof, wouldn't I be caught for out-and-out fraud? Isn't that illegal? How come these guys get away with it if I wouldn't get away with it? I don't understand why they want to get paid for disability if they're out skiing and getting karate belts. Something's wrong.

I combined regular season and playoffs into one final grade, because how poorly the Wings fared in the playoffs defines this season more than the fact they were leading the NHL with 67 points at the All-Star break.

Top Picks Analysis: The offseason additions of Randy Moss and Mario Manningham didn't stop the 49ers from further tinkering with their receiving corps, as the 2011 NFC West champions used the No. 30 overall pick on the rapidly ascending Jenkins. Though he went higher than expected, the slightly built wideout is a cognizant player with very good speed and the quickness to be effective in the slot, and wouldn't have been available with the team's late second-round choice. That selection was spent on James, another smallish prospect who can really run and create big plays in the open field. The two- time All American doesn't have the bulk to handle a every-down role at the pro level, but gives a backfield that's more power-based a dangerous change-of- pace alternative. A series of position shuffling in the third and fourth rounds ultimately ended with the choice of Looney, a competitive and agile player whose strength is in pass protection. He'll get a chance to compete for a vacancy at right guard.
Then there was the draft. A general told me the military does not favor a draft because it would lower troop quality. A draft is not for the military, however: It is for the public, providing greater certainty that there better be a good reason for going to war.

Power plants are the nation's biggest single source of greenhouse gas emissions. These gases reflect heat back toward the Earth rather than letting it escape into space; as a result, global average temperatures have risen by about 1 degree since 1880, according to NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency, and carbon emissions are expected to drive increasingly rapid warming. The EPA aims to slow the rise by barring new power plants from emitting more than 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide per megawatt of electricity generated. That rules out the construction of new coal-fired plants (unless they use an untested technology called "carbon capture and storage," in which their emissions are pumped underground), because coal plants produce about 1,800 tons per megawatt. But all current plants, and any built within the next year, can continue to operate as usual and won't have to do a thing to reduce their emissions.

Sophia Sargent handled a well hit grounder and made the out at first base. Evann Smith put his fundamentals to work at the plate and went 5 for 5.

With a good combine and interviews, Sanu could test himself into a late first round pick but second round remains most likely. Nevertheless, whoever takes him will get a player that is not yet done learning the position. As an athlete, Sanu could have played anywhere for the Scarlet Knights and excelled: quarterback, running back, safety, returner, you name it. That athleticism unfortunately led him to fall into the role of part-time wildcat quarterback during his freshman year. When things went bad last season as a sophomore he was overused in that role. This led to him being banged up and primarily servings as a decoy receiver towards the end of last season. Practicing as a wildcat quarterback took time away from him running routes in practice his first two seasons. If there is one thing Rutgers fans may regret is that they still didn’t get to see Sanu at his best, as a mature, seasoned receiver. We may still get to see it, but on Sundays when he makes us proud like Ray Rice does each week.

How far would 4,300 miles take you? You could drive from Portland to New York City to Miami and you still would not have traveled the full distance that the Forest Service proposes to maintain in the Wallowa-Whitman.

Did Carson Daly really need to do a seconds-long stint as a chipper, American Bandstand-esque host, complete with Buddy Holly glasses? The answer to every question is “no.”

All this comedy in constant motion makes it possible for "Dark Shadows" to concentrate on the plot mechanics only to the extent that they're interesting: Barnabas finds himself in an ongoing battle with Angelique (Green), who, being a witch, is eternally youthful and running half the town. These scenes between the fabulously confident Angelique and the dignified but easily rattled Barnabas are as funny as anything in the film. But this is also where the filmmakers inject a touch, the slightest touch, of seriousness. Angelique really is in love with this guy. She should get her head examined.

There’s no doubt that on this duet Lady G. is a tramp for Tony.

Suu Kyi and her opposition colleagues will have a relatively muted voice in the 664-seat parliament, in which the military and its proxies hold more than 80% of the seats.

* However, before we go completely bananas and shred the Rams for not signing any wideouts, it's probably good to ponder a few things. For example, Morgan was born and raised in the D.C. area. Is it unusual that he wanted to go home? You see, in our snap-reaction anger and frustration, we all make the mistake of assuming that a free agent wants to play for the Rams. And if you want to be honest about this, what do the Rams really have to offer other than money and some fresh optimism after Fisher's hiring? This team has been the worst in the league for a long time, it plays in a sterile and dull stadium, and the ongoing lease debate threatens to further damage the team's popularity. Moreover if you are a wide receiver, you'd probably ask these questions: is Jeff Fisher going to throw the ball? Aren't the Rams going to be a running team? And who knows if Vincent Jackson would have even taken the Rams' phone call? Maybe Tampa Bay and sunny Florida weather looks pretty good for a receiver accustomed to playing in San Diego.

Consider that Friday's practices for Oregon and Wisconsin were open to the media. Mandatory and customary by Bowl Championship Series standards, of course. Those who attended were treated to 15 minutes of players mostly goofing off and warming up.

And then, when the 15 minutes expired, the journalists were shooed out.

People are “mad” about this fine game for many reasons. Most are angry that the ending isn’t a satisfying conclusion to the story (do not Google anything about this!) Some don’t like the fact that there was downloadable content made available the day the game was released, and players weren’t sure whether it was essential to their experience. There were also issues importing characters to carry over from “Mass Effect 2,” which obviously doesn’t concern you. An extra small group of people were angry at how pervasive and matter-of-fact same-sex relationships are depicted in the game. Are you boiling with rage yet? Didn’t think so.

It will be directed by Rob Ruggiero, a director who's turned into a favorite with Rep audiences ("Take Me Out," "Urinetown," "Ella," etc.) and a collector of Kevin Kline awards.

Unfortunately, like our hominid ancestors, we are wired for short-term rather than long-term decisionmaking. Co-directors Mathieu Roy and Harold Crooks have assembled a stellar cast of interviewees ranging from astrophysicist Stephen Hawking and genome researcher J. Craig Venter to behavioral scientists to economists to the former Brazilian minister of the environment. They raise warnings that laissez-faire capitalism and growing consumer demand in the developing world threaten to shred the social fabric and despoil the planet's natural resources. They shy away from proposing solutions, and the filmmakers capture humanizing clashes that illustrate the challenges of finding a balance that serves all parties.

The company sued and wants her to pay punitive damages for what it claims are comments that sullied its reputation.

I was at graduate school in Buffalo in 1968, hanging out in the student union, when a local asked if I knew where he could score. We were soon on the New York State Thruway, heading to meet Jim.

I can still see Jim that night, his big sneakers slapping the concrete as he raced down a dark street looking for his man.
