All of these men (and woman) are well known preachers/teachers who subvert, twist, pervert and misinterpret the word of God. Yet, each one of those quotes is not out of line with scripture… Except maybe White’s. It is because these teachers pepper their messages with actual truth that many true Christ followers today, including Pastors, are being misled or at least making justifications for them as to why one minute Steven Furtick says, “We serve a God that can turn our mistakes into a miracle,” and in the next breath, “embrace a new way to change the world.” Furtick, like all the other Ed Youngs out there, is known for speaking some truth occaisionally…

I'm not a big fan of the NFL. I can't be a big fan of a sport where there are so many long breaks for commercials ( the game is really terrible live. You really notice all the stoppages ) or where the gangsters who run the sport have turned a blind eye to the high rate of concussions / brain injuries / other injuries by its athlete for about 75 years. It's ugly beyond words.

"Benefits and Work has seen one recent medical report in which a DWP doctor explicitly stated that he had used the Biopsychosocial model. The claimant has Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and was seeking renewal of an award of the middle rate of the care component and the higher rate of the mobility component. His condition had deteriorated since his last award over two and a half years ago. The doctor who visited him recorded that: ‘There are few significant findings other than subjective tenderness and stiffness. But the customer is clearly living the life of a disabled person and I have applied the Biopsychosocial model’. The doctor then stated, without explaining how the conclusion had been reached, that the claimant’s condition was just 40% physical and ‘60% psychosocial’…. This allowed the decision maker to conclude that the claimant’s award of higher rate mobility was no longer appropriate as the primary reason for his virtual inability to walk was psychosocial rather than physical".
On the plus side I have a nice, long neck, decent hair, a good smile if I can keep from spazzing, delicate shoulders, and great cleavage. My husband says I have a great behind, too.

He sticks the spear in front of Gurnemanz and prostrate himself on the ground to embrace for the first time both sides of the crack (the same crack through which the Amfortas' blood continues streaming). A small flame of hope in Gurnemanz becomes a fire -- redemption is still possible. Parsifal is a savior. A beautiful scene in which Kundry tries to use water/blood from the stream, and Gurnemanz stops her with "Nicht so!" to offer her a bottle of Holy water that he saved for that day. Parsifal is bald. He baptizes Kundry, puts on a white shirt (like the community of Knights wore in the first act), while Gurnemanz makes a last call for the Good Friday ceremony.

“No doubt you’re going to see losses of share in the jet business in Hawker Beechcraft, and I think that share is dispersing itself with Cessna, Embraer and Learjet,” Donnelly said. “Understandably, it’s pretty hard to have a serious discussion with a customer about buying a $10, $15 or $20 million asset if there’s uncertainty about who’s going to be there to support that aircraft.”

So, if Sparkling Shiraz works with Indian curry, then Shiraz will too. Then what about other spicy red grapes? Grenache, Mourvèdre, Cinsault, Zinfandel might all work, but a certain generosity of fruit is also called for in my opinion, so Carmenère would seem an ideal candidate.

Life can never be the same, once we discover that in the deepest center of our soul, we can live that intimate relationship with God for which we were created. Yes, we will continue our daily routine, but it will become a life lived from our deepest center, filled to the brim, good measure and flowing over – and because God is infinite, we can always go deeper.
I’ve been working on a script for a school drama festival, despite my complete lack of experience in that area of writing. My English teacher of last year (not my mother), roped me in to this drama festival as playwright – even after I informed her that I was poorly equipped for such a task. Four script-writing workshops later, I have a workable piece of writing. But it wasn’t without blood, sweat and tears. Here are some valuable lessons I’ve learnt in my script-writing endeavours.

And now lets dive into the elements of ICFD 7 a bit more. That wonderful Pioneer Award.
I lost my father one year ago, and playing music has been my one safe escape from reality. I imagine Nate will, when he feels like it, use playing music as a relief from mental and physical pain, as a way to say things that need to be said that there aren't words for.
Last Thursday, I had to take the coach between Cambridge and Oxford. I bought a return ticket. That’s seven hours of coach travel, but as it turned out, it was a really enjoyable journey and the time flew by because I’d brought with me a truly gripping and page-turny book. It wasn’t a thriller. I read far too many of those and they are, it’s true, very good at making travelling time pass speedily. This was a book I’d seen mentioned favourably on a book blog (Cornflower, I think) and the little bit I knew about it made me eager to read it. The ingredients, as I was aware of them before I began, were: a remote Inner Hebridean island, a couple there for the summer with two small children, a skeleton found in the garden and a bundle of letters from a woman writing in Victorian times. There were connections with the real Clearances which took place in this part of the world in the late nineteenth century. Every one of these is intriguing as far as I’m concerned, so I bought the book with no hesitation.
Bloggers at goodmenproject.com complained that this was "NOT a way to 'celebrate fatherhood.' Most dads don't struggle with infant care today...Time Magazine, in an article last year titled 'Chore Wars,' found that dads are nearing equality to moms in time spent with their children. Clearly most dads know what a diaper is and how to use it."

After seeing that, though, I really wanted to watch “Castle in the Sky” – I’ve put it off until I get this review done, but it’s solidly on my Friday night to-do list now. The last battle of the first segment was much less moving, featuring two people I’m not so familiar with – Itoda-san (井戸田） the comedian and IZAM (who looked like he was a glam rock type – not my style). The song was “すみれ September Love”, and it wasn’t any great test of singing ability in the first place (though it’s definitely a good karaoke song). There are Johnny’s juniors who can sing better than Itoda or IZAM, but one of the two definitely embarrassed himself.

And so the first act of lovingkindness is to start from scratch—the scratch of pen to paper. The filling of blank pages with our specific likes and dislikes, our heartfelt and regretted losses and sacrifices—this is the beginning of being someone and somewhere again. When we ignore ourselves for too long, we become exhausted and weakened from trying to get our own attention. We become disheartened—without a heart. The gentle pulse that we are meant to attend to, the ear-cocked, mothering side of ourselves that listens to a newborn and springs into action on its behalf, must be mustered now to come to our own rescue. But the rescue begins with the act of writing. Writing is how we “right” our world.

“Cousin Hornmel! What a delightful surprise to see you! Come in, come in!” he said pulling his cousin into his room by the arm. Hornmel for his part was largely covered in mud and sweat and was wearing the usual village garb; leather boots, a torn brown shirt, ragged bottomed black pants, an old worn out headband that once may have been green but was now gray, and a leather vest spotted with holes and peppered with tears. At his side he carried on old knife in a rough leather scabbard, probably the only sturdy piece of equipment he owned, other than his own hard body. He looked around the room with great appreciation and relish.
And for most of us this is a non-issue, as we never have a need to question our gender identity. We are conditioned from infancy, as we lay in our blue or pink world, to assimilate and socialise in to our gender. We go from girl babies, to little girls, to young women to women, without giving our gender identity a thought.
I hadn't realised how dark and smoky it would be. And the smells. I hadn't imagined the smells.

After two years, most can admit that he is a poor fit for the system and efforts need to be made to move him out. On a Cap-ceiling team, you simply cannot have your most-expensive defenseman provide so little impact.

In order to “get back to it” I went into safe territory with this group of layouts to get things started. Every year (since Gwynie was in 2nd grade) I scrapbook the kids school photo along with their class photo. This is as simple as it gets because I try to keep it fairly consistent from year to year. Nothing fancy or spectacular. I also have them write their favorite things during that year. It is so fun to see some things stay the same, but to see changes and especially in their handwriting!
I have to laugh at myself for thinking I had it all figured out, all my big plans! What a nice little reminder that I am *so* not in charge!
“The Group supports the local philosophy of the Tindle Newspapers group and endorses the words of Brian Doel, the Group Managing Director who is quoted as ‘we’ve kept each title very local with local editors and subs and reporters as much as possible. They know most about the community they serve’. However we believe that the situation at the North London and Herts newspaper group is somewhat different to this philosophy. For example, we are led to believe that local management has taken a decision to dispense with all the freelance photographers who were relied upon to cover evening and weekend jobs; a regular sub-editor who assisted with the subbing of the newspapers and a journalist used for occasional holiday cover have all been dismissed.
It’s a great organisational tool and safety measure to keep a record of all the cleaners you use. If you ever have an accident with the cleaners, or one of the kids swallows some, you’ll need to tell the doctor what the ingredients are so I recommend you keep these cleaning recipes together in a Homemaker’s Journal. You can also keep food recipes in it as well seed catalogues, garden plans, patterns and other bits and pieces that are helpful in your home. I have made a Homemaker's Journal using an old a three-ringed binder. That way I can add and remove pages when necessary. There is a post here about making a journal.

Liberals tend to employ emotion-laden invective, while conservatives analyze a liberal idea and attempt to logically pick it apart. It’s a generality, with exceptions on both sides. Ezra Klein is one of the left’s best analysts and critic of conservative ideas.
Even though I know He doesn’t always intervene with miracles, resurrecting in the places we grieve, it’s somehow helpful to know He isn’t ignoring us either. Jesus isn’t cold-hearted, looking down stone-faced and unmoved by our sorrow.

I say – leave the parasites to overrun the cities, towns and streets they never established or developed! Give it names they feel comfortable with, because sooner or later, when there is no more host to feed on, the streets will become disaster zones anyway. If the names do not change, imagine how unpleasant it woud be to hear the media talking about “Hendrik Verwoerd Drive”, or “Hans Strijdom Drive” in their news reports pertaining to the trouble and disorder that is bound to occur sometime in the future. Spare these fine gentleman the ignominious disgrace!
Another such phenomenon, which I’ve seen more on the practical spirituality side of things rather than the academic or psychological and theoretical side, is what could be called totemicism. While “totemism” tends to be understood as the phenomenon within different cultures where particular individuals, families, or peoples are associated with an animal or plant and/or its spiritual counterpart, I’d like to suggest therefore that totemicism is the idea that, therefore, one can engage with totem animals, totem plants, and other totemic spirits on a level that is trans-cultural. Indeed, if one studies wolves, for example, there are a variety of things that come up in relation to them that are indifferent to particular cultural contexts and shared cultural matrices. Wolves are commonly associated with wind, with being able to travel very swiftly, and with being warriors, for example. Totemicism, therefore, often exists in a lot of neo-shamanism. The desire to interact with totemic spirits transculturally is, I think, a syncretistic process, and the practitioners of these paths that I know personally realize that such is its nature.

If I'd done this post a year ago, you'd be in for a lengthy read full of coral lipsticks and glosses. I wanted to own every coral lip colour in the universe, and I wore coral come rain or shine. I loved me a coral lip in Summer, I loved me a coral lip in Winter. By contrast, 2011 was definitely the year of the pink lip. I still loved a coral lip from time to time (as evidenced by the glosses featured below), but when it came to lipstick I was all about a pink pout. I don't know what it was, but I found myself wanting to own every pink lip product in the universe instead. I loved everything from the palest pink lip to the brightest retina-burning fuchsia. So when it came to picking out my favourite lipsticks, naturally I wasn't surprised to find myself with a handful of pinks.
The conversation-starting challenge can be more easily and productively met through the use of a simple question: if you needed long-term care today, where would the money come from to pay for it? If the client is able to identify an asset that is not needed for income and could be reallocated, then asset-based long term care products may be suitable.

The bands sound is probably best described as a mix of ‘post’ and ‘alternative’ rock imbued with some ambient and acoustic textures.
Afterwards I asked what kind of internment the client wanted. The options are for them to take it home and bury it themselves, general cremation with no ashes returned, or private cremation with ashes returned. The first, of course, costs nothing but the latter two do have a fee, with the ashes returned option being pretty steep. She couldn't afford either cremation option and lived in an apartment with no where to bury the kitten. The doctor told me to just double bag it and put it in the dumpster. I said okay, then put the kitten in a box and snuck out to my car to bring her home. I'll bury her in our orchard in the morning.

"Der Wind gibt mir Geleit" is your first hint that something's strange here. The melodic singing style almost sounds like a Christian band--and that style pops up in other places as well. There's a brief moment in "Ignis Fatuus" where you could swear they were going punk. Then they play a couple of morose, black metal ballads. "Die Bürde der Schande" has the band going thrash, using death growls, switching to acoustic guitar, and finally doing a black metal take on an Iced Earth-style ballad, complete with power metal drama in the vocals.
These earrings were beautiful, but last week I mentioned I forgot to say "No earrings!" in my questionnaire. Whoops! They were a great price, too.

Last week I spent five days in Nashville working on my first record with my producer, Marshall Altman. The first three days we were in pre-production. We recorded scratch tracks for 11 original songs (with the exception of Be My Vision which is a contemporary version of the Hymn with a brand new chorus). The process was detailed, trying and really fun. I had to fight for things I really believed in and learn where to let go. It’s probably a good exercise in life too, right? Good therapy.
I don't do well without structure and deadlines. I know this. I figure I'll do stuff later, and then when it is later, I think of something else that I need to do first. The only reason I finished my dissertation, I sometimes think, is because I managed to trick myself into writing it as a series of conference papers, which come with built-in deadlines. (Also, I had a summer tutoring job which involved sitting in the student lounge night after night, waiting for students to show up, and I did have a laptop but didn't have wireless access. This is a tricky and difficult-to-replicate set of circumstances.)
Generally speaking, well thought out digital/social campaigns support, amplify and enhance traditional media marketing. Creating and maintaining a regular presence works - frequency sells, after all. Though there are many who will say the age of “intrusive” marketing is over – they are dead wrong. People are not placidly lying in wait to “interact” with your messages. You need a bull horn and a sledge-hammer to get their attention.

The silk farm was fascinating. Cambodian silk, which feels slightly heavier and less slippery than what I'm used to, comes from worms that eat a completely different leaf than Chinese silk, for example. It keeps you just as cool even though it feels heavier, though. The techniques used today are still the ancient ones.
Overall, Rules of Attraction is a worthy read, twenty times over. There are bits and pieces I did not like, but it was very hard not to love this book in general. It encompasses many motifs, among which is brotherly love, trust and growth. Each of these are impeccably handled. For that alone, this book is worth anyone's time.
Complaint number two: When I was finally asked what the problem was I replied “I’m receiving an error message”. Without waiting to hear what it was, her response was, “let’s go ahead and reset the box”. Now if you’re unfamiliar with a satellite STB box reset it takes about 7 minutes of sitting through on-screen messages cheerfully informing you “almost there!”. I’d actually already tried that before calling, so there was no way in hell I was going to do it again. I’m not a particularly chatty person, so seven minutes of small-talk with a support rep to do something I’d already tried just wasn’t going to happen. Naturally I spent longer than that arguing that I wasn’t going to do it, than it would have taken to just meekly follow along with her troubleshooting script.

The story is written in the first person (Which I'm not always a fan of) with Gwen, Rhys and other characters giving their viewpoint alternating with each chapter. Gwen and Rhys's parts are written brilliantly and writer James Goss really captures the relationship that works so well on screen. The supporting characters are also well written from scientist Eloise to gay couple Tom and Josh. There is even a cameo from Jack Harkness or 'Uncle Jack' as he is referred to. There are plenty of adult moments that set it apart from the Doctor Who books like the scene with one of the 'children' and a hot bath and a rapist policeman. Providing lighter moments are baby Anwen and a plenty of humour from Rhys.

A few years back, when Mr. Harper nearly lost his minority parliament, we were told that anyone who was in favour of the perfectly legitimate procedure of forming a coalition (something he had once entertained himself) was giving aid and comfort to the separatists in Quebec.
If you write middle grade and you haven't seen this, make sure you check it out: Everything you ever wanted to know about middle grade, the finale over at Dystel and Goderich. In the wrap up to this informative series, editor Molly O'Neil and agent Michael Bourret talk about how to make your middle grade novel stand out. For example:
Eight years ago today, I knew next to nothing about epilepsy. That all began to change the next day, when Traci Pink arrived in my life. She was a feisty, sometimes potty-mouthed, opinionated and vivacious young woman from Coal Harbour, Nova Scotia, a suburb of Halifax, who’d come to Owen Sound to make a new life for herself. And that she did, and in time we became the centre of each other’s world.

So, when the four of us get together, there are moments when I'm left out of the conversation. I'm perfectly fine with that. I have nothing to contribute and basketball is something that all three of them enjoy. I get it.

My Indonesian’s also improved quite a bit. Actually, it’s more like it’s returned. I used to think that I’d lost most of it. Composing sentences took forever and I’d feel silly saying it. Each day here I get more confident with it. It’s also more than just relearning, it feels like my mind has switched over. I’m starting to think straight in Indonesian and reflex words like “Wadduh!” are coming out. I’m also starting to mix some Javanese like “Ngak” and “Ngono” into my speech too, which is annoying cousin Edo cause it’s probably like I’m putting his two native languages into a blender. Maybe by the end of my twenty days, waktu saya pulang ke Aussi harus mengadaptasi lagi mengunakan Bahasa Inggris. Bagian bagian dari pos ini sudah dipikirkan dalam Bahasa Indonesia. Rasanya memakai Bahasa Indonesia lebih enak, lebih menyenangkan.

Back together again…the friendship stronger than ever. We had reached an important crossroads in our relationship with each other what with all of Helena’s drama and subsequent episodes, but like the kindred spirits that we are, we rallied as one in support and love and we held it together. Now we’re back in full force stronger and closer than we were before, ready and set to go!

In my previous concurring opinion, I expressed the view that the emergency powers vested in Commonwealth Act No. 671 had ceased in June 1945, but I voted for a deferment of judgment in these two cases because of two circumstances then present, namely, (1) the need of sustaining the two executive orders on appropriations as the life-line of government and (2) the fact that a special session of Congress was to be held in a few days. I then asked, “Why not defer judgment and wait until the special session of Congress so that it may fulfill its duty as it clearly sees it?”

We have been having a little wake up call, in regards to how Cystic Fibrosis can make living in Hawaii very VERY VERY difficult! Ethan has been presenting with a regular/daily cough that is no where near normal. We believe we have determined that it is allergies and that it is now under control. BUT...if we ever have a serious health issue, there is no where in the state of Hawaii that anyone is even remotely knowledgeable about the care needed for Cystic Fibrosis! Thus we feel, it is time to return to the mainland.
Don’t let worry get in the way of that love.

A few weeks ago, I started a deliberate diet and exercise programme that I put together with the explicit purpose of building up my strength as quickly as possible to be ready for the next stage. Some time in February, I got back to work, more or less on the full pre-cancer schedule - albeit almost completely from home, with very little goings-out - and that has been going very well. I've been able to keep up well with what needs to be done, adding a little more every week. But now I need to move on, start getting more back into life in the outside world. The time has come for phase two.
I know none of you are too coarse to concern yourselves with pricing, but the bottle was between two and three dollars, after having been shipped all the way from Krakow.

Perhaps it’s a daily practice. Aligning day in and day out. Trusting, sort of sitting back and watching life happen. After all, we’re all conscious and aware. We’ve set intentions. We can trust in that. Making choices in the now, accepting and aligning with what is happening in front of us.

If you’ve seen the old news that Uganda has to offer and are disturbed, I encourage you to do some research and find out what is really going on in Uganda. I spent months before I went to Uganda researching the country. I talked to many people on the phone or with Skype, I emailed countless others, I read books, I monitored the news. If you want to find out what the situation is really like, find out. Don’t blindly fly yourself to a developing country like a Western idiot. I would also suggest finding out more about organizations that you support that work in foreign countries. Find out what their relationships are like with the local people and find out how they are grooming local people to take over their group. No aid organization should plan to be somewhere forever. If they do, they are not focused on solving the problem they are there to address.

Maricor and I are going to see how things go once the baby arrives. BUT MaricorMaricar is definitely going to get bigger and better this year! We have a few exciting projects under our belt that we can't wait to share and a couple of commissions pencilled in. We're also going to venture into customised short run textiles. Still only in very early planning and dreaming phase but this is the year we're going to make it happen. I'm so excited, this year is going to be crazay :)
We waited until today to fill in our census forms, mainly because it seemed somehow to be tempting fate to be counting the household before they’d hatched, as it were (it’s bad enough, frankly, doing it today but I think we’re likely to both survive until the evening and it’s even more unlikely we’ll get any overnight guests). So over our morning coffee we had a pleasant enough half-hour going through the questions. I’m afraid we didn’t obliterate the bar codes or fill ourselves in as Jedi knights or do anything else to annoy the powers that be – at heart I’m a fairly law abiding person and I think on the whole a census is a good thing, whoever’s actually running it. I missed out last time around because we were living in Swaziland, and the times before that I think I’ve managed to be missed more often than I’ve been counted. It’s lucky I’m not planning on having any ancestors as I’m not leaving much of a paper trail for them to follow…

One of the arguments that facilitated communication proponents offer is that autistic individuals have such poor fine motor control that facilitation is necessary; however, one can see that the autistic person may indeed exhibit fine motor skills past the normal individual's fine motor skills.
Nowadays my guilty secret and it's not really even that secret, is probably the fact that when I'm really thirsty, I don't go for a nice refreshing pint of lager, but rather a fruit beer, alcoholic ginger beer(sometimes for breakfast!

He belonged to a well known family in the village; he was barely a teenager when his mum passed away. His eldest brother assumed the role as head of the family as their father drank himself into the bottom of a bottle and had no desire to get out. The second brother moved away from the island; so he assumed the role of cook and bottle washer, taking care of the youngest brother and making sure his family always had food to eat. Unfortunately the only model of parenting he had was that of father who used alcohol to escape from the harshness of life. Is it any wonder then that he learned how to do that at an early age?

Sometimes a business model and philosophy can be easier to change and re-invent than a strident and steadfast attitude. There is a 'call to arms' in publishing at the moment, and change is often most directly coming from smaller, independent publishing houses who through sheer want of survival are exploring every publishing niche; maximising all they can from what e-publishing will yield; deep-mining regularly the estuaries and flowing waters of communication which have become the sea of social networking. The responsibility lies equally with author and publisher because the once viral highways of business must now share the opens roads with the new forward-thinking commuters as well and the inexperienced Sunday drivers out for a view of the scenery rather than the road ahead.

Okay.. Ladies, to continue my month on love and dating I want to approach the subject of attracting your Asian man or any man for that matter. I always get questions about how to attract and Asian man and what are they looking for in a women. I cannot speak for every Asian man out there, because as you know all men are different and there is always that special guy that isn’t the norm. But from my experiences and conversations here in China and in my life of dating different kinds of Asian men; I can tell you with most traditional Asian men are looking for or NOT looking for in a woman.

It’s been so long since I have been in a season like this that I forgot how the attacks of my enemy would be. He has sent out his minions to try to bring me down. Since Wednesday it’s been bad around here. I came to a point last night when I had to cry out for help from some ladies who have become like sisters to me. Once the key questions were asked and the answers given, I was able to pray and ask God to fill the house with His Spirit and tell the minions to get out. This morning when I opened my eyes I prayed over the house and it’s occupants. Thankfully today has been much more productive and less full of strife.

Good Afternoon and welcome to my blog! I hope everyone had a nice weekend, as always ours went by much too quickly. Today I was able to play for a bit in my card room thanks to a couple of sleepy boys and I created this fun shabby-chic Easter card. The chicks are a digital image from Pink Cat Studios. I colored them with Pro-Markers and cut them out with my Cutterbee paper snips. The beautiful patterned paper is the new "Kitch" collection by Girls Paperie. I bought the 6x6 sampler pack from Claudia and Company. I really love the sampler packs. I never make it thru an entire paper pad, so the samplers are perfect for me. Anyways, I cut the paper into 4 squares and matted them with GP white card stock. I then used my Janome to add the zig-zag stitching around all 4 pieces. I then attached them to a Kraft card base. The nice Nestabilities-like shape was cut out using my Cricut and SCAL software. I attached the chicks with foam dots and added the vintage lace and bow. I thought pearls would be a fun way to accent the border of the large shape, and then I added the pretty mini rosettes from Michael's Recollections collection. I added a pearl accent below the roses also. The Easter sentiment is from A Muse Studios.

Sociologists, anthropologists, educators, psychologists, and other academicians often study these groups as distinct entities. Today’s changing world brings up new questions. Are there common themes researchers are finding among children who have been raised cross-culturally for any reason? What remains distinctive to each type of experience? What about those growing up in multiple cross-cultural categories at the same time? How does this growing cultural complexity factor into today’s research and practice? What are the practical implications for those, such as educators, who work with this population? How can we help today’s children maximize the potential of a cross-cultural childhood while dealing constructively with the challenges?
This exhibit stands in contrast with Mannahatta/Manhattan, another excellent show from 2009 which aroused New York history lovers. Mannahatta was map-based, but pure speculation, an imagining of what the island was like before European habitation. 'The Greatest Grid' starts from many of the same sources -- the Mannahatta Project was built upon early 18th century topographical maps -- but elaborates forth upon the present landscape with stunningly detailed drawings of almost every inch of Manhattan.

I’d seen all of the old vintage typewriters on the site and asked for one for my birthday this year. My husband got this one for $40 with make-an-offer on eBay. It does need a little servicing, but I won’t actually be typing much on a manual typewriter. Then I received a $100 bill from my in-laws for my birthday, and with that I got the writing desk ($50 at an indoor antique mall) and the crystal candle holders that are on my desk ($37.50 for both tall ones at Marshall’s/Home Goods.) I do love a bargain!

I’m starting to feel old and, worse, see the traditional effects of old age start to work on me. I feel like a chalk cliff who knows that the waves pounding at its base aren’t going to go anywhere and are going to stay there for the long haul and keep grinding away until all that is left of me is a little tiny nub that not even my totally utilitarian Maths teacher would use to write out a quadratic equation.
in the midst of other changes and the chaos that is life these days, my annie is turning one on tuesday. say it ain't so. the joy of my life is almost 365 days old. despite the craziness that having a third child has brought to our family (a friend once referred to the third child as 'sinking the family battleship')... i wouldn't trade susanna kathleen for the world. not for a single moment of peace and quiet. not for an easier trip to the grocery store. not for a hip suv instead of a minivan. nope. not a chance. she is ours, all ours and i thank God for her every step of the way.
Yet, there are still reminders that we were in the midst of a really hard time. The aftermath of our childcare drama lingers; everything resurfaces any time someone is upset about something; the center feels divided and there’s still a bad taste in my mouth. My husband still has stories of kids who are not doing okay or tricky conversations between faculty. The crisis is over but the effects remain…and will for a while.

We're all big fans of granola here. I love making it myself since I can customize it to what we like and make a large amount for less money than buying it in the store. This batch made about a gallon sized bag of granola. We've been using it as cereal and as a topping for yogurt...as I did below for breakfast the other morning. This recipe isn't so great for snacking...it crumbles easily and doesn't clump together well like other recipes.

For example, RAND’s research conclusions on the Third World, limited war, and counterinsurgency during the Vietnam War were notably wrong-headed. It argued that the United States should support “military modernization” in underdeveloped countries, that military takeovers and military rule were good things, that we could work with military officers in other countries, where democracy was best honored in the breach. The result was that virtually every government in East Asia during the 1960s and 1970s was a U.S.-backed military dictatorship, including South Vietnam, South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Taiwan.

1) He brought up a good point that I missed: his very large head. Conceit is absolutely not a character trait of his – but his physical big-headedness is an important feature, worth mentioning. But how big is it, really? Here’s a small illustration. Many years ago, my family went horseback riding on St. Maarten. Jonathan must have been about 13, and was required by the riding facility to wear a helmet. However, when they brought out a selection of youth helmets for him to choose from, none of them would fit on his head. After exhausting their youth helmets, they brought all of the adult-sized helmets they owned for him to try; again, not a single one would cover his head, and with no other options available, they eventually allowed him to ride helmetless.

Almost (u-nan-ah-mous-ly) unanimously the U.S. Supreme Court Justices ruled that the Farmers Union claims were indeed VALID, therefore, all property foreclosed by the Farmers Credit System was illegal and all those who were foreclosed on would have to receive damages. In addition, they ruled that the U.S. federal government and banks had defrauded the farmers, and all U.S. citizens, out of vast sums of money and property.
Above all, I hope my boys follow the example of my Sweetheart, David. He is a righteous man, who loves the Lord above all else. He loves me, and he loves our boys.

I know that as my sons follow the example of their daddy, they will become the men the Lord intends them to be.

He closed his eyes and pictured what it would have been like. Coming from a tiny pimple of a town in the middle of war-ravaged eastern Europe, and next to penniless, they left their entire lives behind. He understood now how America, how Lady Liberty, had rekindled hope in the hearts of the poor and oppressed. They had fought against all odds, laboring day and night to scrape up enough money for the voyage. Doubtless, many of them had still come up short, and had to be left behind. Still, some must have managed, and some out of millions is still many thousands. In time, these would form the amalgam of American culture. And Lady Liberty, chaperon of the great unwashed, guided them all to her shores.

Now, she did not come from Holland, as I said, she came from Belgium, but I have no strong mental image for Belgium, other than perhaps chocolate, but that is so vague and common an item, the sight of chocolate does not always make me think of Belgium, rather Belgium makes me think of chocolate. So spirit took the nearest country I did have a reference for from my mind and tried to share it with me. Belgium and Holland of course share a major border and coastline and have cultural similarities. And then suddenly things started to click into place. I was taking the things I saw literally, when it’s not always possible to do that. Some clues are mixed in in an abstract way as symbols and require some decoding.

My man had a birthday recently, and he chose these chocolate malt cupcakes to help celebrate. The cupcakes had a moist and fluffy consistancy and the perfect amout of chocolate flavor. The frosting was delicious, but only after it had time for the flavors to marry overnight. I thought it was far too sweet right after making it, so i would frost these the night before so the sweetness has time to calm down a bit. I didn't get an overwhelming malt flavor in the cupcake or the frosting, so next time I may try adding more malt. I'll probably also crush up some malt balls and sprinkle them onto the frosting for an extra whammy.
Now, I’m not going to say that his belief is untrue. I’ve heard it over and over among many church leaders of our day. But what I will ask is simple: Where is such a belief outlined in the Bible? Especially for a pastor?
Types of guns and ammo are always debated and probably always will be. I have seen people shot with all common calibers.

Get your front sight on his shirt and stay on him as long as he is standing with whatever gun you have.

Before I delve into my argument allow me to add a disclaimer: I am the proud product of public and accessible Canadian education and I will defend it vigorously. I attended only public schools from K-12. Afterwards, the quality instruction I received at St. Thomas University in Fredericton, including the small classroom sizes and 1:1 attention, was instrumental in enabling me to be successful when I pursued graduate studies at Oxford. I graduated with about 15k debt after working two or three part-time jobs at a time and it took me roughly 8 years to pay it off. All of this is to say I heart Canadian public education.
P.S. In case you were wondering where I’ve been for the past month, I had to relinquish all laptop and bandwidth rights to my master, who demanded that he “must write his comps” and that he was “not joking.” We only went on two 4-wheeler rides during all of March. The weather was so beautiful, though, that I finally convinced him that he could just let me sit out on the porch by myself if he was going to sit inside and stare at the computer all day. So, I guess I found a new freedom in spite being snubbed for “comps.”

Last night Chris and I were talking about Harper and Pooh and I broke down. I told him that I feel like we are getting further and further away from her. He said something that struck me, "I know you feel like we are leaving Harper behind but we aren't. She knows that she could never be replaced. She would want us to be happy and she wants us to bring Pooh bear home. We aren't leaving her behind, she will always be with us....right here (putting his hand over his heart and mine)." I know what he said is true but my heart still aches for her. I know that moving forward isn't "moving on" and that moving forward is a necessary part of living a happy life but as we approach spring and as we are getting closer to Harper's birthday, it becomes more real. The first year without her is almost over and then we move onto the second year and with that, rest of our lives without her.
When my biological father left her 7 months pregnant with me and my 2 year old brother, took the only car they had and then said horrible things about her to all their friends, she didn't just lie down and give up.
I think I will leave off here, and see what others have to say, and come back and add something later if I feel it would be useful. (Ha! Maybe I don’t like being seen as someone who always thinks she has all the answers!)

And so it goes, and so it went, for Johnny and for so many other songwriters who score a hit or two, and try to make it into a career. You knock 'em out and you hope for the best, and yes, you also hope that the music industry (the RIAA, ASCAP, BMI, RCA, etc.) tell the accountants not to screw you so badly you can't pay for health insurance.

So where did that 4% number come from? I was curious, so I went right to the source. The survey questions and the key findings of the study done by the National Center for Education Statistics are published on their website. It turns out, there are many sections in the survey. The section called "Fighting, Bullying and Hate Behaviors" includes the questions that lead to the conclusions those around-30% numbers. There is a completely different section, apart from the bullying section, entitled "Fear," under which the questions about fear of "attack or harm" were asked. These are the questions that give us the 4% number. These questions are, by design of the study, not related to bullying. It seems those questions are referring to other kinds of violent acts.

From what we already know about the new leader based on media accounts as well as from his professors in Switzerland, is that he is not only a well rounded intellectual with the capability of speaking several languages but that he is not intrigued by the decadent lifestyles of the capitalist class. Unlike his brother Kim Jong Nam who succumbed to a capitalist lifestyle and began going to Japan and Macau, hanging out in Western resorts like Disneyland as well as gambling in casinos and staying overseas, Kim Jong Un has the ability to look beyond selfish pleasures and see the bigger picture just as his grandfather and founder of North Korea, Kim Il Sung was able to do. There is of course something to say about living in a world where the pursuit of human pleasures is the ultimate goal, that is the underlying goal and principle of the Humanitarian Socialist Party as it should be the case with any Communist Party that claims to subscribe to the beliefs of Karl Marx. Kim Jong Un as a 29 year old leader is not against the pursuit of pleasure, he is against the idea that only the capitalists should have this right and access in their private villas, casinos, and resorts.
The awkwardness is still every bit as present as the first day, if not more so. But hearing how well the child slept the first night, "Better than I've slept in a long time" because the child finally had a real bed to sleep on told my heart that we made the right decision to become parents.
However, where organised criminal networks are present, the recruitment practices involved are important to consider. Recruitment usually takes place by agents i.e. middlemen (or more often women) who will lure victims through force (drugging/ kidnapping); or coercion via promises of fake opportunities or boyfriends who trick young girls in to running away with them. Sometimes a fee is extorted from the family of the victim as they think it will result in higher rewards when they reach their destination. Women are often used to engage trust as agents need to be able to establish themselves quickly within communities.

What that suggests for a similar Fukushima fallout map for the United States, for the radioactive Iodine-131 (with a half-life of just 8 days) is that the plume of 10,000 to 100,000 Bq/m^2 (the bright turquoise blue in the above Japan map) would likely extent to close to the US, maybe even with some isolated spots in the US or Canada, and then erratic patterns of fallout dispersion with areas in dark blue with medium blue hotter cores here and there.

Martin Luther King, Jr. earned his spot in history through an unwavering commitment to social justice, even in the face of imminent physical danger. President Obama seems to have forgotten what his leadership embodies: that America’s “security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, and the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.”[2]Instead, he set aside his allegiance to ‘the rights of man.’ Instead, he signed into law Bush-era mistakes based on violence, ignorance and xenophobia.

The Bulls Fan's parents live in a very beautiful part of Pretoria in the Gauteng province. While this may seem a little paradoxical to anyone not living in Gauteng, myself included, I must admit that their immediate area is lovely. The houses and properties are enormous, and each boast a wide, neatly mowed green pavement, along with towering Jacaranda trees that burst into brilliant purple bloom in the Spring. What's more, they live just a short walk in the sun from the Austin Roberts Bird Sanctuary. We've often driven past the sanctuary, and I've craned (excuse the pun) my neck to spot the cute little resident buck that lives in the gardens, as well as the magnificent birds that call this part of Pretoria home. The park also offers its own restaurant, which overlooks one of the large lakes. On our recent trip to visit The Bulls Fan's parents, and to go to the Kruger National Park, I twisted his arm to take me for lunch at the Blue Crane Restaurant.
The plan was to fly to Los Angeles and visit my brother. I remember seeing tickets for around $650 while thinking that was outrageous for a round-trip flight within the continental US.
The single greatest night of my southwest road trip this summer took place in the least likely place imaginable: Colorado Springs, an epicenter of evangelism located an hour south of Denver. After reuniting with a friend of mine who moved out there two years ago, my companion and I were treated to the spectacle of the New Life Church, the famed congregation from which Ted Haggard was deposed in 2006 for being a meth-smoking hypocrite. I was familiar with the Rocky Mountain megachurch from the documentary-cum-horror flick Jesus Camp, but I still found myself in awe of the sheer magnitude of the place. After nosing through its various auditoriums and atria, we decided to scoot after witnessing the end of a Christian rock concert, and thus headed up to the mountains to find an overlook of the city.

It’s also interesting to observe in programmes like The Apprentice that it always seems to be the women’s team which implodes in a storm of backstabbing and bitchery, while the men ride out each task on steeds of over-inflated egos and self-belief. It could of course be down to some pretty naff editing. Either way, it’s either there because it actually happens or it’s there because TV producers think the audience expects or enjoys watching it happen.

He is found guilty and Jamie and Zoe are to be returned to their own times. They are allowed to see the Doctor just one last time to say goodbye. There is a real sense that the Doctor is totally resigned to his fate that makes this whole scene even sadder. The departing companions enter a TARDIS and depart forever, with only the memory of their first adventure with the Doctor intact and the rest wiped from their minds. Zoe is back aboard the Wheel and it is so bitter sweet as says "I thought I'd forgotten something important, but it's nothing." She looks back as thought she has forgotten something then heads off, back to work. Jamie is back at Culloden and charges a redcoat, shouting once more "Creag an tuirc!" I've really grown to love the dynamic in the TARDIS at this point, even if Jamie has become less independent in the last few stories. I am sad to be loosing not just my Doctor, but his two closest friends as well.

Work isn't the be-all-and-end-all, is it? I have a young family, and I do a ton of voluntary work at school and for the PTA, and I sell clothes on Ebay. So why do I still - after 6 years - find it so tricky to answer that loaded question, "What do you do?" I do a lot. I just don't get paid for it.
Recently certain events have brought us closer and farther apart. Closer because one of his cousins is now dating one of CJ's best friends we have a couple who calls us all the time to do things. Closer, (okay this may sound cheesy) because we have tons of new TV shows we wait to watch so we can see them together. Now the farther...it really didn't dawn on us that if he started car-pooling with someone who lives in his building he wouldn't be able to stay over my house during the week. Farther in that our lives are so busy we barely have times to ourselves to have our lil relationship because people are always dragging us here or there. Farther in that it had been a while for *Cough*. Pure and utter tiredness didn't help that. But it all seems like all we have been doing is watching TV together...that I think signals the word, "RUT".
Oh yeah and also there are some that have to be in there because of Marazno and his new evaluation system for our county. When I say "students will show their understanding" I mean that they will hold up their fingers 4, 3, 2,1 using a scale to show me that they understand. 4 meaning I understand and can teach a friend, 3 I understand but need more time to work on it, 2 I understand some but still need more information, 1 I am trying but I don't understand. Then I have to track their understanding on the board next to the scale and celebrate their success. I know it sounds crazy but I feel like that part is what I'm being evaluated most on.

The roots of the event are unclear. Some say it all began way back in 17th century London when impoverished Venetian immigrants would offer scenic tours in improvised canal boats made of macaroni and PVA glue. Others say the event has it’s routes all the way back into the 1980s as a right of passage for East End barrow boys determined to prove their worth to gain the much coveted honour of being Sir Allen Sugar’s human punch bag. Whatever the origins of this remarkable event, it has none the less made itself at home as a regular feature of the nautical calendar.
Even when the questions have been raised directly at hustings meetings Livingstone has been cautious and circumspect.

This is by no means a formal, full, neutral report – I don’t take shorthand, there were two or three hyperlocal questions where neither question nor answer was fully comprehensible to someone from outside the area, and in all honesty, I took more detailed notes where the candidates’ answers interested me and rested my hand when the speaker wasn’t holding my interest. Politically, tribally, I’m pro-Labour and Scottish Green, anti-Tory, and (at least prior to the UK coalition) was prepared to consider voting LibDem and equally prepared to consider SNP, certainly in a council election. But in general I found at this hustings that my interest was held by the speaker rather than the party.

Did I leave way more impressed with the opening band than the headliner? Yeah, yeah, maybe I did. But I couldn’t help it, the energy of Kithkin is way too infectious to be denied. As lead singer Gareth Campesinos! pointed out, the crowd was a little bit too into the opening band and he found it kind of rude. A joke? Perhaps, but not entirely untrue. People were so into Kithkin that I even wondered how many people were there just to see them and if they even cared about the headliners.

Therefore, the death of Bin Laden will undoubtedly rob militant groups in Africa of an ideological, spiritual, and rallying figure. Since declaring war on the United States, Bin Laden and his terror network has killed hundreds of Africans, while his Islamic fundamentalist ideology led many to take up arms in the name of a religion that preaches peace. His death will directly represent justice for the hundreds of people killed in Kenya and Tanzania, and indirectly for the tens of thousands that were killed in Sierra Leone and Liberia.

The space holds a maximum of 35 guests at a time and has a no-reservations policy. Going at opening (18h00) means you'll enjoy the place in relative peace. Later it gets livelier with larger groups - and more fun with sound. The acoustics of the bubble are those of a whispering gallery: every conversation is amplified and sounds moves about the space in strange ways. Friendly doormen carefully monitor entries and exits via the two door system to make sure one door remains closed at all times. Apparently if both doors are open at once, the dome deflates!
But as I’ve read and studied Jesus over my (relatively) short life so far, the more I read, the more I love the gospels. Sure, there were times when Jesus in their pages was opaque and mysterious, there were times when other books spoke to me more and I didn’t enjoy reading the bible as much. But as my understanding has matured, so have my tastes and appreciation, and as I mature and grow, the bible becomes more and more important to me—and the gospels in particular. Now I know that the problem when I was younger was not the gospels, but me, and today I turn to them again and again with relish. They contain the stuff of life, stories about Jesus, and my life would be a great deal flatter, more monochromatic, less deep, less textured, and far less beautiful if it weren’t for the quartet of voices from Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, singing into my very being.

I switch on the "news" and I expect to get events and developments reported, because that's what (I thought) normally functioning news does. I do not expect or want so-called reporting slanted in favor of one political camp against another. Fox News claims that it "reports" and we the audience can decide if that's true. And in the face of video and document-backed critiques and exposés, Fox has repeatedly claimed that its reporting is not biased. Hence the need for the slogan: "We report, you decide".

This is a real lose:lose for women. I’ve been told by some people who have larger, stronger bodies than mine, that I should just get over my concern about walking alone at night, and go ahead and do it, because it’s silly to worry all the time. Yet when women do just that, when they do avail themselves of the freedoms that citizens in our society are supposed to enjoy, then if they are assaulted, they are blamed for it. They shouldn’t have been out walking in the dark.
Learning that he’s stuck working the store all day, Dante convinces his friends to play hockey on the store roof. The game is short; 12 minutes in, an irate customer shoots their only ball off the roof and into a gutter. Reopening the store, Dante finds out one of his ex-girlfriends has died and her memorial service is today. Randal talks him into closing the store again and going to the wake. The visit is disastrous, although the audience doesn’t see what transpires during the memorial service. (The missing scene was animated for the 10th Anniversary Edition DVD; see below.) However, a later conversation between the two reveals that Randal knocked over the casket.

Some of this could be disciplinary, those trained in philosophy programs I find tend to speak more in terms of things like 'misreading' or 'misunderstanding', while those of us who pursued theory in comparative literature departments and the like are I think a bit more pluralist. You'll notice I rarely will say anyone got something wrong (most certainly in regard to 'what is', though sometimes its possible to be wrong in regard to a philosopher, ie: 'Heidegger just hates ontology!'). Rather, I generally try to say that we see things differently, or there seem to be contradictions in a chain of logic, etc. But I don't believe in this 'right' or 'wrong' thing, rather, in Nietzschian fashion, with 'better' and 'worse'. Or to be Deleuzian/Guatarrian, not 'what does it mean', but 'does it work'? An experimental pragmatics, if you will. But to quote Harold Bloom (a figure I'm rather ambivalent about), all reading is misreading, and misreading can be very, very productive.

What the hell is going on with the world? I understand that I am a resident of a nation that micro-manages the entire world, but where exactly do “people” fit into this equation? I thought the two bro’s fighting at a local bar over a blonde was a disgrace to humanity, but these advances put that to shame. These creations, created by humans, have eliminated the idea of “human interaction” and direct conflict. Now, instead of using troops to battle against one another, we invent weapons that are created so humans are taken out of the equation. We create weapons driven by computers and technology in which the purpose is to wipe out the entire human race.

Gold sequined minis, Mongolian lamb vests and perfectly tailored tuxedo jackets make their bridesmaid dresses cocktail appropriate.
It’s important to take time for yourself. Time to relax and collect your thoughts in a peaceful way. I know with responsibilities it is hard. With children it is hard but is possible (I’ve been a live in nanny a couple times) if you really make the effort. Even if you have to set up a whole thing for children so they can have fun while you are having you time. For example make a cool tent fort in the living room surrounding the tv so it is like a movie theater for them, or a craft or even have them go into their rooms and entertain themselves with reading or playing quietly because even children could use some down time each day and need to be taught how to take good care of themselves.

I was a bit disappointed in the World's Longest Yardsale this year. The Yardsale is an annual event that stretches along the 127 Corridor for 675 miles from Hudson, Mi to Gadsden, Ala. We always take off on Saturday morning early and go as far as we can during the day...maybe next year, I'll take some time off work and we can travel farther on the Corridor to see differant vendors.
But I am very excited to see what is next for me, and to get to spend more time with my awesome children. I'll be keeping Spencer at home with me and walking Cameron to and from school every day. I'll be able to spend time with friends during the day, take a class or two, build my photography business (maybe?), finish projects I've started, start new projects, and find what makes me happy.
My game was over after the first ten minutes of play. Rather embarrassingly, I had twisted my ankle in the pre-match warm up. There were neither any opponents, nor divots in the pitch, on which to blame the injury on. I had simply changed the direction in which I was running in, when my full weight fell upon my left ankle, which I then felt slowly inflate inside my boot like the cheeks of a tuba player. It was what Marc Judd had rather philosophically described as just one of those things. He too had aggravated an injury prior to the game, although Kristian Hewitt was adamant that his hamstring strain was being used to mask the hangover he believed him to be suffering from, having spent the previous evening at a wedding reception at Ford's social club. Despite being picked in the starting line-up he would play no part in the game.

The other Spice Girls hold no mystery for me. Baby Spice? Next! Oh yeah, Ginger Spice? Really? Scary Spice. Don’t I know you? You remind me of a teacher I had in high school. Anyway, the other “Girls” seem less interesting to me, less intriguing. They seem to lack any special powers.

Maybe the ubiquity of these companies in football culture only makes you feel wistful when you look at what football meant to the people who first filled the grounds and helped it grow into the biggest sport in the world. To the average fan it was a 90-minute respite from day-to-day drudgery and life-curtailing jobs, and as author J. B. Priestley put it, instant membership into a new, more care-free community as you walked through the turnstile.

HOLLY: Yes, there is a huge homeless teen population here in Seattle. When I first started writing, I wasn’t sure if my ideas would fit with the reality, so I did a lot of independent research, talked to people who worked with homeless teens, did some street-level recon, and took a class at New Horizons (the homeless teen org in the book). I asked Pam Longston, board president at NHMin.org, to read an earlier draft for street verisimilitude, and she provided a critical piece to Joy’s story: she told me at some point, homeless teens decide it’s safer to live on the streets than
If you are not interested in history I can only quote George Santayana: Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
In a blog on The Huffington Post, Rosen (who, in full disclosure, was once employed at this website), further clarified her comments. Ann Romney “seems like a nice lady who has raised nice boys and struggled with illness and handles their long-term effects with grace and dignity,” Rosen wrote. “What is more important to me and 57 percent of current women voters is her husband saying he supports women’s economic issues because they are the only issues that matter to us and then he fails on even those.”
“You've caught me without my make-up, Darling,” he groaned, painfully easing himself down on the bed and pulling a loose cover up and around him. “Oh I'm sick... Poor ol' Marge is sick... not even a fucking filter since last night. And that wig is useless! Just makes me sad.”
Other stories have placed identity loss in the foreground. How often we talk about the loss of identity as being an effect of disability! Yet, the absence of crucial information about identity may itself be a Disability. Take, for instance, persons who are of First Nations (Native American) descent, but are cut off from their ancestral roots. This is a surprisingly common experience created by some of the same forces that marginalize persons who are traditionally disabled, including marginalization, colonialism, and enclosure. The overall effect of separation from one’s tribal roots is frequently to instill a sense of lost identity, and a haunting sense of one’s Self as incomplete. Efforts to regain tribal identity may be rebuffed by the tribe of origin for any number of reasons, although most of those relate to the protection of limited resources, and, oddly enough, tribal identity. The effect, however, is to reinforce the seeker’s sense of loss and alienation.
When does it start exactly--your fearless child starts seeing spooks in the dark and eyes under the bed and creepy things in the closet? Like shyness or embarrassment, fear sneaks up on your when you're least expecting it. Things that were once fun and exciting suddenly strike terror into your little darkling child's heart. And there is often little rhyme or reason to what inspires the fear.

Obviously I understand Carbon, where i’m planning to play, could get closed down too. I’m not relying on this to happen, it would just be nice. Also hopefully poker will just become legal in next year or so which would make this better.
From the expanded multiplayer, and exciting new game modes, the single player campaign is being kept under tight wraps. As a fan and a writer, I hope that the anticipation of Halo 4 lives up to what it’s being hyped up to be. I have faith that 343 will take the Halo franchise to new levels and new depths. There is a lot of new interesting gameplay ideas that will be incorporated into the series which we have yet to see in videos. I don’t think gamers should worry about the future of Halo, looking back at how much passion and respect 343 has for the Halo franchise. This will put ease to many and keep worrying down to a minimum. 343 will take Halo to where it hasn’t been before, I am excited to see where they will take this new trilogy. There is no official date set for release although there is speculation that it will be released around November. Until then, thank you all for reading, and feel free to leave a comment and weigh in on the issue.
The court made reference to S.51(a)(ii) and tried to define the scope of “any place” as required under the Indian Copyright Act. It juxtaposed this phrase with “place of public entertainment” as used in the UK Copyright Act, 1956. The court inferred that this indicated that the India legislature intended to broaden the scope to not only include places of public entertainment, but any other place as well. It also referenced the later UK Copyright Act, 1988 which repealed the 1956 Act, which
I actually intentionally failed this sequence a few times so I could indulge my curiosity about the environmental storytelling in the surrounding area. Wheelchairs and debris litter the hallway. Other inmates in adjoining cells convulse in their straight jackets while the Necromorphs attack. (Mrs. JPG posited two good questions: "Can you save any of them?" and "Wait, why are they in straight jackets if they're already locked in cells?" The answers are, spoilers, "No," and "Beats the hell out of me.") Some inmates have scrawled cryptic messages on the walls (sigh); but instead of using blood, they've apparently used their own excrement (...yay?). Which, from what I understand from Lockup, is fairly realistic.
Then we sat down and relaxed while sipping our wine and listening to Diane and Llisa's conversation which was centered around Llisa's beautiful work as well as her involvement with the Eames Foundation and their many upcoming events.
The methodology of submission is an integral component in breaking our will to resist ever encroaching tyranny and the ultimate end game of the elite – a eugenics-based culling of the herd that is accepted by the dumbed-down masses as beneficial for the planet and the Gaia hypothesis pushed by the global elite.
Lee Teuk then agreed, “When they report that we earned tens of billions of won, people think we earn a lot of money. The truth is, if we earn 100 billion won, we have to take off Japanese agency fees and other costs, meaning that we don’t receive as much.” Eunhyuk then drew out a laugh from everyone when he complained, “And then we divide it among ourselves, more than 10 members, so that’s disheartening.”

While I was cleaning out my craft area and getting old items ready to donate and trash (GASP!), I came across some of these Sweet Pea felt flowers from SU! that I had somehow forgotten about. It's like new stuff! They became my "stars" for this card, hehe. I absolutely love how this little Pure Innocence girl turned out - I stamped her in Memento Tuxedo Black and paper pieced the dress and colored the rest with Copics. The patterned paper is Stella & Rose Hazel (naturally) and I just added a few twill tape tags under the panel. Super easy card!

Oh Topshop, why do you do this to me? Against my better judgement, I succumbed to the Topshop website the other day, and spotted a grand total of 5 dresses which I want in my wardrobe NOW. Unfortunately, my bank balance can barely stretch to one, let alone all five! I think my favourite would have to be the embellished black dress - click here to see it close-up, the detail is pretty stunning. The yellow dress would bring a gorgeous splash of colour to a winter night out; while the white crochet dress could be dressed up or down, slung over a white slip and opaque black tights. Well, I will be getting the first installment of my student loan soon... :P

Martin the cat went AWOL today. We last saw him yesterday morning. No sign in the morning. Much as you like to think he's on temporary walkabout, you can't help but worry. He was one of two kittens when we got him. His brother Murray got run over when young. I'll never forget the ten days or so that Martin kept vigil outside the back door, calling to his brother every night for an hour. It broke my heart.
But ultimately light takes over darkness. We are assured that all is not lost. We hear Jack’s yearning whisper, like a prayer: “Keep us, guide us, to the end of time.” In the eternal scheme of things, shown by the display of the magnificent cosmic visuals, we see all members of the O’Brien family reunite and bathed in a warm bright light. Jack once again embraces the ones he loves, his mother and his brothers. He also stands shoulder to shoulder with the one who has inflicted in him the mixed emotions of pain, anger, and love, his father, now reconciled under the brilliant light. The third part.

Quite apart from Homer’s ageless epic, however, Professor Fone has done a masterful job of fleshing out his characters in all their heroic proportions, as well as their human weaknesses. Agememnon, for example, has been lionized as a king among kings for centuries, and yet his character is far more believable as the self-promoting, glory-seeker by which Fone has depicted him.

You’ll notice that the police unit uses the term ‘unnamed predator’ or simply ‘UP’ to describe the vampires. In general conversation they prefer the more derogatory expression ‘leeches’. This is another way in which I felt The Radleys had something in common with Ultraviolet because they never used the term ‘vampire’ preferring the epithet ‘Code Five’ which is a bit like the fact that in Buffy the Initiative talked about ‘hostiles’ rather than demons. In The Radleys Peter and his wife refer to practicing vampires as “blood-addicts.”

Several of my critics say I'm behind the times. That people want a legal moonshine product and thus they shall have one. The problem remains, however, that there is no agreement about what moonshine is as a spirit type. Most real moonshine is made using 100% table sugar as the fermentable substrate. This has been true for as long as cane sugar has been plentiful and cheap.

The jail census represented one of these actions by the judicial state, and understanding the occurrences, or lack of occurrences of “racial” categories depends on understanding the administrative meaning of those terms in that context. The late-18th c. was a transitionary period on many fronts, including in the emergence of new forms of racial identification. It’s no accident that in Quito, as in New Spain at the same time, artists of a naturalist or taxonomic bent were making the now famous casta paintings. It’s also a transitionary period from the perspective of criminality, marking the initial emergence of more modernist forms of punishment in which crime, and criminal acts inhere in the individual. But, we weren’t there quit yet, and through the end of the colonial period (and even into the republican), individuals are not indictable as inherently criminal, regardless of the acts they committed. (Yes, individuals are indicted, but individuals are not seen as inherently criminal based on racial or ethnic categories.) Criminal acts represented a disruption in the flow of communal harmony that the judicial state existed to ensure, and flow was restored through punishment of acts.
The volunteers are often former tram-drivers, as the historic trams use the same lines as modern ones. All volunteers have to pass specific exams to ensure they know how to operate the historic trams on modern lines. Even as we drove through town, the guard occasionally had to clamber out to manually change the points of lines.
I've been immersing myself in reading running blogs, finding blogs of women runners I could relate to and who were inspiring to me. What I found is that runners are very similar to readers. Their New Year's posts were not so different from the readers whose blogs I read. Runners set goals (Run a Marathon in Every State, Run 1500 miles, Beat my Personal Best Time at a 70.3--whatever that is, and Plank for 100 minutes.) They reflect on their running year and set new goals. They announce the plans they have for 2012 and have wish lists for races to run. They seem as overwhelmed by not having enough time to participate in every event as I do when I don't have time to read every book. They are truly passionate about what they do.

On the dresser, in her bedroom, sat a black light, a lava lamp, and a slow light. Casey loved to sing, dance and fantasize. She studied the Solid Gold Dancers. Her imagination kept her company most of the time. She thought of herself as quite the little dancing queen, seeking no one‘s approval, but her own. Although Casey was always busy doing homework, she was having a difficult time keeping the hormones out of her thought process. She struggled in school due to her mind drifted constantly. It seemed like she spent more time waiting for her parents to come home from work, then anything else. She was a lonely girl and felt every bit an only child.

Strangely, young men coming out of the armed forces now have a higher unemployment rate than those who don't. This makes no sense to me and I'm counting on the fact that the economic stimulus that my dumb-ass platform will create will reverse this. When our young men come out of the army they will have been taught a skill; they will know how to get their ass out of bed in the morning and do something; they will have bypassed some of the most dangerous years of their lives; they will have hope for a productive life.

In late 2009, I was Facebooking one random evening when I happened across my friend Mary's page. Her child had been tagged in a picture with her brother and sister-in-law, and her sister-in-law had written a cute note at the bottom. Curious, I clicked the next picture, which also had a letter accompanying it. Emily had written letters to random things she'd come across during her day, food she'd eaten, places she'd been, and of course, to her husband, Mr. Loerke (who always gets two letters). I sent her a message telling her how much her letters inspired me, to which she warmly replied with a friend request and we've been friends since.
Any name, it may seem on the outset, is as good as any other. But the nature of alternatives that were being thrown up was an interesting socio-political indicator of sorts. A few names, of the Bangla, Bawngo or Bengal kind, made the rounds. Names of this kind found their votaries in people who argued – there is no East Bengal, why should we then call our province West Bengal? There is a certain problem with this unfortunate ‘there is no East Bengal’ view point. The roughly eastern segment of the land inhabited primarily by Bengali speaking people will always be East Bengal. East Bengal is as much a geographical entity as it was a political entity. The political entity has been conceived variously as East Bengal (1947-1955), East Pakistan (1955-1971) and Bangladesh ( 1971- present). The changing political construction of that geographical space does not change the psychogeographical space that East Bengal holds in the mind of large sections of the people of West Bengal, especially the refugees and their immediate descendants. People who were refugees from East Bengal did not locate their abode differently in the same psychogeographical space as East Bengal’s official political name changed with time. There also exists the East Bengal that does not simply reside in the memory of migrants. This is the living entity of East Bengal, in its political form of Bangladesh. It is not surprising that radical political groups, extremely staunch in their opposition to the Pakistani state, still chose to refer to themselves with their East Bengal epithet – various factions of the Purbo Banglar Shorbohara Party (Proletarian Party of East Bengal) and the Purbo Banglar Communist Party ( East Bengal Communist Party).

The novel ends with the escape of one of Ishmael’s comrades from the Imam’s jails, an escape that symbolizes the militancy and indomitable spirit of the Iranian people. The spirit of resistance is still in the air in Iran even under the most repressive conditions, as the frequent outbreak of youth and workers protests in recent years have shown. It is the specter of this rising up of the Iranian people, and not US and Israeli war of aggression against Iranian sovereignty that spells the hope for real liberation of the people of Iran.

But what I think Smeltertown shows us is that the experiences of El Paso’s mexicanos were incredibly diverse. Segundo Barrio had all of the hallmarks of urban barrio life and was so close to downtown – Smeltertown was essentially a company town on the far outskirts of town for many years. Their (Smeltertown residents) lives were shaped by the immediate proximity of industry. Add that to the different experiences of folks living in Stormsville or Ysleta or the upper valley . . . this only makes El Paso’s history more interesting. Mexican life in the borderlands was not just one thing.
Day 23
Not one of Amanda Howard’s children survived and Denver was suspicious and uncomfortable about the situation. Somehow with nothing more than suspension, he got a warrant from Judge Marion and proceeded to have all the babies dug up to have autopsies preformed. In a matter of days, Denver knocked on Leland and Amanda Howard’s home with a warrant for their arrest. They were charged with four counts of murder. All four of the children had been killed at the hands of their parents. All four had been smothered with a soft object, such as a pillow, and two of the babies had broken necks. Solving this case gave Denver a big boost in self-esteem, and he became the talk of the state. There was no doubt that Denver did his job well and was honored several times for his efforts. However, when he was off duty, his behavior was as if domestic violence owned the home.

Through such practice, one recognizes that the ego-centric concept of Zen-Ken-Ichi is wholly inadequate and incomplete. As set forth in my Sanchin DVD and Book, I submit that the traditional definition of the three battles of Sanchin (for example, breathing, posture and state-of-mind) to be found in the martial arts contributes to this inadequacy. By redefining the three battles of Sanchin as the physical battle, the spiritual battle and the metaphysical battle, the stage is set wherein ego-centric mind-body unification is no longer the end-all goal.

I now have four days left to work before I stop practising. I have been trying to stop practising for about two years now and have been putting off the fateful day for one reason or another. Now that the end is in sight I feel a bit sad. However, there is, now, no going back as I have taken myself off the register from 31 December. In any case I need to be realistic, standing up for eight hours a day is a young person's game. When I was younger I used to stand up all day at work then stand up all night in the pub. Nowadays I rarely get to the pub, even when I am not working. I shall miss the staff that I have worked with but I will not miss the patients. I can live without the hysterics, tantrums and theatricals that relatives and patients sometimes subject us to. Life will be quieter and a little less colourful, but that is how I prefer it.

The recipe here differs considerably to mine - these were cooked with onions, cardamom pods, coriander seeds, cumin and a pungent curry powder that had been brought back from India by a friend (it smelled considerably fresher and more flagrant than the types one can buy in Britain). The above 6 cheeks were cooked slowly on the stove top for about 3 hours.

Through migration “our societies are experiencing an unprecedented encounter and mixing of cultures….In such a situation, the new evangelization can provide the opportunity no longer to perceive the Church's mission as a north-south or west-east dynamic but one which transcends the geographic confines of past missionary activity. Today, all five continents are fields of missionary activity. We must also seek to understand the sectors and places in life where faith is absent, not simply as a result of drifting from the faith but from never having encountered it. Transcending the geographic confines of former missionary activity means having the capacity to raise the question of God at every moment in the encounters created by the mixing and rebuilding of the fabric of society….”
"If you raise taxes on these so-called rich, you're really raising taxes on the job creators," he said at the conference, which was sponsored by the Bush Institute, which he opened after leaving office. "And if the goal is to create private sector growth, you have to recognize that the best way is to leave capital in the treasuries of the job creators."

Most of my childhood memories center around our kitchen or the dinner table. My mom cooked a simple dinner every night, and until I was in high school, we always had dinner as a family. "Helping" my mom cook dinner every night was our chance to talk, just girl to girl. I got so much from that time.
Watson and Brown went their separate ways during the summer of 1963, and Jeff Bradford and Cliff Barton came in on guitar and bass, respectively, with Long John Baldry -- another Blues Incorporated alumnus -- occasionally sitting in on vocals. Their second single, "Preachin' the Blues," was released in September to modest but promising success, and for a time it looked like Davies and company were going to be a major force on the burgeoning R&B scene. But Davies collapsed late in 1963, and was diagnosed as suffering from acute leukemia; he died in January of 1964. All Music Guide
The other day I was sitting at work in my sea of cubicles banging my head on my desk thinking WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE!? So I texted Andrew and said, "Babe, You only live once. Let's sell our cars, let's sell our house, and all of our belongings and buy a plane ticket to anywhere in the world. Let's document it and inspire people to get out of their routines and just see the world!"

When you do something outside of the mainstream definition of normal, people think they have a right to demand an explanation. Or if they're interested in possibly doing it themselves, they simply really really hope you'll explain it to them. Yet even with the nicest, most well-meaning and interested people, it can sometimes feel like a pop quiz (or at least, I imagine it can... Having never faced a real pop quiz of which people speak, my metaphor could be off). Like I said, to me, it's fun. It's energizing. It's a new challenge each time, to decide how to present things, which quotes or anecdotes to bring up (at this point you may be starting to see why I enjoy public speaking so much...).

None of these are suitable for our purpose of coconut milking.

AF: There were many inspirations while writing The Hunt, but I feel particularly indebted to Edward Hopper, a painter who once stated that he had a “propensity for solitude.” His work Morning Sun was a painting I returned to time and again, especially during dry spells in my writing. Something about the stark loneliness of the woman on the bed despite (or because of) the sunlight captured the solitude and isolation with which I wanted to fill the pages of this book. I feel indebted to this painting for the way it spoke of loneliness in a manner that was both nuanced and powerful. Hopefully, this layered kind of loneliness came through in the protagonist Gene of The Hunt.

In the photo above, that pallet is what Dusty planted different types of lettuce, bell peppers, and sunflowers in. They're growing great! That black tub is actually a livestock water tank that Patrick and I snagged from the dumpster at Tractor Supply (with their permission) when we were getting pallets out of the dumpster years ago. The tank had a crack in the bottom, so it couldn't be used for watering animals, but I KNEW it could be useful to me! So I had Patrick take the saws-all cuttin' tool to it twice, and got 3 separate big planters out of it. Yay me!

Are cardiology stethoscopes better than typical types at wholesale medical supplies outlets?Yes, because most stethoscopes used in cardiology has the patented tunable chest piece that can conveniently be adjusted to emit low or high frequency sounds. In addition, the chest piece is fabricated using stainless steel to deliver outstanding acoustic performance. In terms of audio delivery performance, one cardiology stethoscope is better because even the brachial pulse is entirely audible. Stethoscopes are used together with a sphygmomanometer to monitor blood pressure levels accurately.

But things are going well. And on the brighter side, he has been rather good in his first two starts. Hasn't he? In ten innings, he walked five but struck out thirteen. That's promising. But he also has surrendered seven hits. And when combined with his walks, his WHIP remains "un-Johan" like. So like everyone, I am very much looking forward, to his third start of the season tonight.
Keep a notebook. Why? Because no matter how good your memory is, human’s get distracted, and next thing you know, you can’t even remember what you ate five minutes ago. It’s the same for writers and their ideas. One minute, you have the greatest idea for a fiction book. Five minutes later, you try to remember the idea and it’s gone. Trust me, I have a pretty good memory myself, and yet I forget my ideas.

The other day I was looking at the line up for The Great Escape and I couldn’t help but be amused and pleased by a lot of the band names. Forgive me for not being more ‘down with the music-o people’, but I hadn’t heard of a lot of them, so these band names were completely new to me. I wanted to share some of my favourites on Twitter, but the list was getting longer and longer, so I thought I’d bore anyone that’s going to accidentally stumble across my blog with it.

Upon my return to Atlanta after my first early-90s sojourn to New York, this statement rang in my head for years. I had always hoped to return to New York, but Atlanta had clawed me in its grips, as hometowns often do. Yeah, my life was there, but my heart was way up north. And now, here I was, with Steve driving a car speeding its way to the home of the man who made this statement that had stuck with me so. On the way up, I bought a copy of Levon's memoir (co-written by Stephen Davis) called This Wheel's On Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of The Band. Steve and I stopped at two hotel rooms (one in North Carolina and one in New Jersey), and I read as much of the book as I could. I had never really known about the rancor within The Band, but Levon's book clued me in on why Robbie Robertson was the sole songwriter credited for all their songs: it was a lawyerin' thing.

You are your own accuser, the priest, jury and judge, the understudy of God. The sentence conferred is deliverance from the guilt of sin. But, and here’s the question, if you can’t forgive yourself, can you really be forgiven? Is there any sin to great? A sin that damns us no matter what Acts of Contrition we perform?
Based on our own independent tests, the results of Rootmetrics speed test were by far the most accurate of the speed test apps we have used. Unfortunately for Rootmetrics, actual network speeds are generally much slower than users expect. Conditioned by the marketing departments of cellular providers, many cellphone users assume that the speeds they are seeing on their networks are near the capability of the standard or at least are a significant fraction of the capability. According the to published standards, 3G for either standard (GSM or CDMA) has the “capability” of speeds well above 10 Mbps. Of course, the capability depends a great deal on the modulation scheme being used, which in turn depends on the noise environment. What that means is that while 10 Mbps is certainly possible in a quiet lab environment, it’s much harder to achieve these speeds in the real world.

Here’s what The Blaze originally reported about the incident:
She started the scan and, for inexplicable reasons, opted to first focus on one of the uterine fibroids that, yes, I am aware that I have. Can someone please tell me why they do this? Are they trying to drive us crazy? I came here to make sure that the child growing inside of me is thriving and healthy. Would you mind leaving that benign mass on the other side of my uterus alone until we get that 411? I asked her if she could please first take a quick peek at the baby to be sure he or she was okay ("go with the flow" is, unfortunately for health care providers, not my motto in situations like this). She assured me that she'd already seen the baby move before focusing on the fibroid, wrapped up her scrutiny of other parts and then panned over to the baby, whose steady, beating heart we saw immediately.
The resemblance is pretty subtle, I guess, based on the leaves framing the eyes, but it is there nonetheless, and I doubt it was mere coincidence on the artist’s part. There are interesting questions on how this allusion might be read, and I think the flower over the feminine subject’s mouth is quite interesting and a nice comment on the novel, but I’m going to table those topics since there’s one more cover to get to.

At the face of it Lyari’s grievances seem very simple- the right of employment, basic amenities and safety. Achieving these goals is not hard if the rulers and leaders of all the involved parties agree to put the interests of the public before their own interests. For the time being however, the unabated killings and siege in Lyari has to stop. The army has been quite adept at handling the violence in Karachi in the 1990s and more recently in Swat. A strong hand is needed to halt this violence but an even stronger will on the part of all political and social leaders is needed for sustainable peace.

In taking Bradford West, Mr Galloway overturned a Labour majority of more than 5,000 at the 2010 general election. In fact it's only noticeable in the entire article that the M word is used only in a direct quote, though somehow or other Yvette Cooper seems like the BBC to equate Asian and Muslim as being the same thing, which is profoundly absurd and no doubt abhorrent to the vast majority of Asians who are not Muslims.

It will be three years in June when I first started with this blog, and in those three years, I've gotten to know so many talented and creative women (and men). I had been making jewelry for a couple of years before I started blogging, and was selling in the store where I had a space. When I started blogging so many friends were opening Etsy Shops, and so I jumped on board. Guess what...selling on Etsy isn't a piece of cake. There are so many sellers and shops and products; it's a given that you can get lost in the crowd.
To me, ATM could have been a decent horror flick, but there were just to many flaws with the masked man and his motives. Not everything has to be spelled out and clear cut to make a good story. But this is a case where they tried to do that, but it didn't work out. At least not for me. I thought the movie was stupid and dull and lacked any interesting qualities. Just the opinion of one man though....don't shoot me.

I admire the painstaking and sometimes touching effort generations of man have put forth in cataloging the gaps in our understanding of the universe, and it would be a shame if things like the midrashes and Ouija boards and the Elysian mysteries were all for naught simply because they weren’t scientific. Rigor is – wait for it, stadiums full of stupid people – O-ver-RA-ted. So in that sense I believe in things like charms, and their cousin the glamor.

3) Determine your ‘flinch point:’ Amy has a system that she uses when she’s thrift shopping to help her decide what she’s willing to buy. She says that her personal flinch point is $5, and if an item costs more than $5 then she thinks long and hard as to whether or not she will buy it. Only at thrift stores could the $5 flinch point makes sense. Compare that to regular, new market retail: “Imagine what it’s like to pick up a new jacket from Banana Republic with the $99.99 price tag still dangling next to the $5 Goodwill tag, only to stop at a major retailer on the way home and buy a tube of mascara for $9,” Amy says.

For me the word "mum" has two strands; two paths that have crossed for many years. That of my phenomenally complicated relationship with my mother and that of my pursuit to become a mummy. In some ways, for many years, the two were so intertwined that it was difficult to see where one started and the other stopped. I walked both paths simultaneously for many years. The word was the most evocative and emotional word that existed for me; within me. Becoming a mum has helped peel away the layers of these emotions and has led me to a peace that I didn't know I could have.

Those who dwell outside of the current western framework of imbalanced yang, defined by domination and control, still know feminine wisdom, despite modern man’s furious and violent attempts at denial and annihilation of this truth. Any reading of the planets and influences of the second house (and a chart in general) must begin to come from a much broader and more inclusive conceptual framework than the set-default one currently in use, which relies on the greek and roman patriarchal conventions of story telling. As Sobonfu Some’ and others with similar intelligent integrative faculties point out, this failure has left us all telling incomplete stories and with a deep longing for the true richness of narratives we have the power and potential to cultivate in our lives, with each other.

It's not so much that Russian girls dress more or less scantily than in other countries, but there is a lot of premature sophistication, in my opinion. I'm almost 30, and there are eight-yr-olds more sophisticated than I am. The heels, the pea-coats, the perfectly coiffed hair...Is it a problem or not to dress older than one's age? That's debatable.

When a composer seemingly wants acoustic instruments to imitate the sounds and textures of electronic ones, I suppose it is pointless to object to the fantasy-world recording balance which places the listener right inside the ensemble - so much so that, listening with my old and trusted AKG K-240 DF headphones, I felt as if I was hearing rosin on the bows of the Ensemble Intercontemporain string players. You'll never hear music this way in a concert hall, but that may be irrelevant because Fujikura's sound world is far closer to Jimmy Hendrix' guitar feedback effects than to the buttery textures of a Brahms symphony floating in the acoustic warmth of the Boston Symphony Hall. Boulez delivered Fujikura's Fifth Station with such adrenalin-drenched intensity, and with such reassuring control of the piece's frenetic energy, that not even for a moment did I listen to the music "from the outside", so to speak. I simply went along for the ride, which felt like the 3:00 a.m. drag race on Hollywood Boulevard.

Does this scare me? Yes. I am not sure that the kid inside me wants to have to deal with situations like that, but I know the man inside me will step up when asked. I know when a hug is needed, or just a quick hand squeeze. It’s not even a question to me; I know the reaction my body and soul will take. Therefore, last night, when I really wanted to be a kid on my final dead day eve , I stepped up. I do not believe it was a full declaration that I was ready to be done with childish things, but I know in my heart that it was as close as I am going to get for a while.

In other words, careers are as different as writers are. There's no doubt that without the JUMPER movie, I would not be a full time writer now, not because of the movie money, but because of the movie publicity that still brings people to my back list.

Alas, BART doesn't cover the entire town. Two breweries you'll need to ride MUNI out to, along the N-Judah line or various buses, are Social and Beach Chalet. Social Kitchen and Brewery is where brewmaster Rich Higgins whips up intriguing and approachable beers (try the Rapscallian, a Belgian Golden that pairs with just about everything on the menu). That this neighborhood spot is two blocks from many attractions in Golden Gate Park is a bonus.

Now, I think I have a bit of a strange view on the whole gay issue because I learned how to write (and continue to do so, mind you) by writing scads of slash fan fiction. The first time I became emotionally involved with a romance story it was two guys making googly eyes at each other. And, for a time, I would only read stories about said googly-eyed guys.
Well, if they’re not happy with the party, definitely they’re voting against Umno. If I’m dissatisfied, I’ll vote against Umno. So what? After all, Umno is just a party. But then, if you maintain quality in Umno, why would anybody want to vote for someone else?

In effect, this would turn every corporation into a mutual. We would still have a market economy (which has a number of beneficial features), but control of the surplus accumulation within that economy would no longer be concentrated in the hands of a few large corporations – or, for that matter, of “a board with a lord”, as happened under nationalisation. Rather:

2010 was supposed to be my year. And, after re-reading this, Ive reasoned that it…. WAS??? It never gave me what I wanted, but it DID show me that I never wanted those things in the first place. It never gave me the answers, but told me I was asking the wrong questions. 2010 was my stepping stone, the key to my 2011. 2010 was my mediator, reckoning with me to find a new solution. And here it is.
Ever since, Cassel has carefully built up a facade of normalcy, blending into the crowd. But his facade starts crumbling when he starts sleepwalking, propelled into the night by terrifying dreams about a white cat that wants to tell him something. He's noticing other disturbing things, too, including the strange behavior of his two brothers. They are keeping secrets from him, caught up in a mysterious plot. As Cassel begins to suspect he's part of a huge con game, he also wonders what really happened to Lila. Could she still be alive? To find that out, Cassel will have to out-con the conmen.

I didn't want to hide anything from Ellie and have his absence come as a shock so I told her the truth immediately. Brian and I wanted to let her make the decision as to where she wanted to say her final goodbyes. Ellie made the bravest, most grown up decision I've ever known her to make. She wanted to be there with him at the end.

Since May is “Better Speech and Hearing Month,” it is a good time to take a closer look at your own child’s speech and language process. I encourage you to be a partner in treatment (if your child is in therapy). Just like every other sensory-motor function in the body, speech needs to be practiced every day for improvement. Your child’s SLP can help you do this.
One of my absolute favorite writers is Carol Berg, who writes mostly high fantasy in first person male perspectives. I love her work to bits. But I also recognize that, until recently, the voices of the characters were pretty much identical from book to book, series to series (she’s slowly changing that). It’s a very recognizable voice, and it’s very effective, but as soon as she switches viewpoints to someone else, it becomes all too clear that it’s the book’s voice, not the character’s. Which can be all right, in some books, but in this case, it’s part of what killed her Bridge to D’Arnath series for me. Voice can be powerful, and it can be what drives and sells a book, but at the same time, it can’t remain the same for everything. It’s got to change, it’s got to fit the story told, and it’s got to be unique every time, otherwise, it’s going to sound less like a tool of the story, a vehicle to paint a moving picture in your mind, and more of a writer writing a book.

That victory coupled with Tottenham’s win over Bolton has seen both clubs leapfrog into the top five and they are breathing down Arsenal’s neck. In the run-in, Tottenham is has the easiest set of fixtures and Arsenal has to record two victories against Norwich and West Brom to assure themselves of a Champions League berth.

With that, one even begins to suspect that this whole debate is a put-up job – nothing having changed since Thatcher's euro-enthusiast days.
He makes a compelling argument as to why keeping people in poverty and ignorance hurts not just the person in question but the country as a whole and might lead to the rebellion and unrest. Often people in power argue that educating the poor can give them dangerous ideas. Here he shows how the poverty actually gives them these ideas. I found the points made in this book to be highly relevant for today too. It is always important to know where we have come from but I think the issues in this book are as valid today as they were when it was written. The importance of education, the importance of universal suffrage and being involved in the political process and the inherent problems when one group dominates another. None of these issues have gone away. None of these issues have been fully resolved.

Hi Readers! This little note just got me thinking. Read it and I’ll give you my thoughts. It’s from a guy named Barry Jacobs in Brooklyn and here’s his blog. — L.
There are many ways that we can enjoy our run-by-routine life. As for me, I still have to rediscover them. That’s one reason I’m having this blog.
Rather, the album's distinctive array of clapping, clacking, rustling noises suggests an entirely aural narrative, an impression that the lengthy song titles — "She Walked Into a Room, and Found Her Absence." — do little to dispel. There's something very cinematic about this music, which was recorded in an old theater and sounds like it consists mostly of objects being moved around, sometimes violently, in space. In other words, its sounds are intimately linked with the circumstances of the recording process, even if it's difficult, if not impossible, to actually figure out the origins of these sounds when listening. Unami and Kawaguchi employ a large array of sounds: footsteps on wood floors, voices whispering like they're waiting for a show to start, sampled recordings, the ticking and clicking of tiny motorized gadgets, and various shuffling and banging noises from cardboard boxes and large objects being moved around. The music stimulates the imagination, encouraging the listener to invent narratives to accompany these puzzling sounds, or simply to imagine the musicians holed up in an old theater, spilling aluminum cans across the stage, spooling out rolls of tape to assemble Rube Goldberg sound-making contraptions, jamming on guitars, making their movements and their process of construction an inextricable part of the final product. This is fascinating, challenging music with a real sense of humor as well, as evidenced by whimsical gestures like titling one track "Knocking By Anybody of Nowhere (Dub Mix)" because there are lots of dubby echo explosions scattered amidst all the ticking metronomes and hissing noise. This is music bursting with surprises and mystery, a sonic film that's utterly immersive and unforgettable. [buy]

In urban and suburban areas, trash disposal is optional. No one has to have a monthly bill for trash service. Perhaps, for many people, the convenience of weekly trash pick-up is worth the price one pays for it. But in a world of scarce resources and lacking incomes, it might be a luxury folks are willing to forego. In my experience, financially and otherwise, it is probably a luxury that is wise to give up.

Inspired, they say, by the largely Sunni uprising in Syria, the group has refused to leave the square, even after clashes with security forces last week ignited days of fighting between Sunnis and minority Alawites in Tripoli. Sectarian tension has worsened during 14 months of Syrian unrest as Syrian refugees and wounded fighters have flooded into the city.

Waterproofing is probably one of the most misunderstood issue in home improvement topic. Owners should understand that there are basically two types of waterproofing categories; construction waterproofing and remedial waterproofing. Both are equally important but we tend to deal more with the remedial side of waterproofing. There are numerous reasons why we are left to deal with the remedial works five to ten years down the road and sometimes even lot sooner than that.
These are areas that require further research. To be continued.

Children who are being bullied need to be able to tell teachers, parents, and other adults in charge what is happening in the moment clearly and calmly and persistently even if these adults are very distracted or rude - and even if asking for help has not worked before.

A dummy is a plain-paper mock-up of a book that shows the size, paper quality, possibly the real cover, and other physical aspects. In novelty books, it shows paper-engineering features such as flaps, gatefolds and pop-ups. You'll see these dummies at book fairs. They are made by the publisher (or paper engineer) and you don't need to worry about them as a writer - unless you are also a paper engineer, of course.
Environmental regulators authorized at least $12 million in state cleanup subsidies to support the Riverfront recovery and Buccini/Pollin Group projects, many sited on contaminated former industrial sites or properties too close to pollution to ignore.

The timing for this dive was to drop into the water as the sun was setting so that we still had some daylight while we geared up and listened to Divemaster Boed (Yes, we were with Boed again.) explain the dive plan. The diveboat arrived at Kokomo around 1800 and we joined a small group of intrepid souls for our adventure into the Stygian realm. A fast ride later, we tied to the dive buoy over the Rhone and geared up while Boed explained how things would go. We were the only boat there. We’d have the Rhone all to ourselves this evening.
The first part of the Shahâdah is called “Tawhîd,” the Unity of Allah, and that is found expressed in the first part of the Shma’ as well, in stating that God is One (Ehad). We see this expressed other places as well, for example in Exodus 20:3, “You shall have no other gods before me,” so I would say that Muslims and Jews at least share the first part of the Shahâdah. The second part though is more tricky. On two levels even. First off, Jews don’t recognize Muhammad as their prophet. Most Jews probably don’t even acknowledge him as a prophet, while some would say that he most likely could have been a prophet, though only sent to the Arabs, not to the Jews, acknowledging the praiseworthy mission of spreading the Tawhîd. But it isn’t only in regard to the “lack” of acceptance of Muhammad, there isn’t an equal for Moshe Rabenu, A”S, to be found in the Torah, at least not expressed in statements like with the unity of God. There are many incidents though where his prophethood is stated and emphasized, making it rather clear that his prophethood is to be accepted. Only later does it become part of a list of clear doctrines to be accepted as part of Jewish faith, namely in Maimonides thirteen principles of faith, all being introduced with the statement “I believe with perfect faith that…” It is the seventh declaration, after declaring that all the words of the prophets were true, stating that the prophecy of Moshe Rabenu, A”S, is true and that he is the “father” of the prophets, meaning the greatest of all the prophets, both those before and after.

The Bicycle is another very popular means of transportation in Key West. There are bicycle paths in many parts of the island and provide a great alternative to walking for those that live further out than simple walking distance from work or play. You can party in Old Town and still not have to worry about drinking and driving, you can either walk your bike home or call a taxi with a bike rack and get a ride home for you and your bike. Either way you are home safely and you are not a slave to the high price on gasoline and the very limited parking on the island. All you need is a pole of some kind to lock your bike to and you are off for the fun or work.
Before his career had even taken off, two huge stars gave him advice: Raizo Ichikawa (star of SHINOBI-NO MONO said, “It doesn’t matter what you do as long as you remember the script.” Shintaro Katsu (best known for ZATOICHI), on the other hand, told him, “The script never matters; it’s all about the acting.” This caused Hongo some considerable confusion early in his career, getting such contradictory suggestions from two of Japan’s biggest stars. But, eventually, Hongo got the hang of it.

But there is one thing that is undeniable: Steven Spielberg is someone who has been imitated as a director time and time again. Anyone who's seen such films as Duel, The Sugarland Express, Jaws, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial... yes, and even 1941... are unable to deny that the man has a way with the camera.
Yes, we are old and slow these days but rest assured, we have at least one good fight left in us. We have loved this country, fought for it, and died for it, and now we are going to save it. It is our country and nobody is going to take it away from us. We took oaths to defend America against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and that is an oath we plan to keep. There are those who want to destroy this land we love but, like our founders, there is no way we are going to remain silent.

I don’t have much to add to my mid season thoughts really – somewhere along the line Persona 4 found its groove, changed from a fairly average show with a bland main character to an awesome show with a very likable protagonist, and it never went back. Have to admit I guessed the true culprit long before their identity was revealed, but that didn’t diminish my enjoyment of the last few episodes at all. So in the end, I’m glad I gave Persona 4 a shot despite having never played the games, and I’d highly recommend it to anyone who skipped it for that reason.

A few days ago I met a blogger in person after we made contact about 5 years ago. My online friend was just as I expected he would be in real life. Immediately we began discussing South African politics in the pleasant ambiance of a coffee shop. There weren’t many people in my day-to-day life that viewed politics the way I did so after a while, I mentioned that I would have loved to stop time at that moment because I wanted to think of a way to preserve it so that I could remember it forever. I experienced real freedom because there was no need to make a conscious effort to filter my spoken words. We let our words flow freely. And I explained that my blogger friend need not worry about the ANC government’s treatment of non-black human rights activists that stood up to the apartheid government. Almost all of them were socialists and they never understood the nature of the apartheid government’s failure. Their sacrifices are bearing no fruit and life isn’t fair.
Lots of stamping is encouraged with this week's Waltingmouse Sketch Challenge, I opted to make a splash with a grouping of frames and cameos, even squeezing a mother & daughter combination into one of them. I really like topper elements too, this time I went with a passing of lush pleated ribbon, and a strip of stamped contrasting card to break the brown ribbon and the brown scallops, which were made from stamping a row of doily stamps and hand cutting to make the scallops. I particularly like this doily for this as it has little scalloped edges as well, or can have if you opt to cut them that way.

At some point this summer, once a few of the newer breweries have had a chance to get established, I'll do some polling to see what you think of the new breweries. For now, let me pose this question: if you had to drink beer from only Oregon breweries that were older than three years or younger than three years, which would you choose? Given the number of extraordinarily accomplished venerable breweries in this state (Hair of the Dog, Pelican, Caldera, Double Mountain, Widmer, Full Sail, Deschutes, etc.), this should be a no-brainer. My guess is it's not.

Anyhow, Beatrice approached me and was impressed with the videos. Funny, she hated my guts three months ago when we argued over Egypt and my mocking the so-called “democracy” taking place. I told her the Islamists would take over and put it back to the stone ages. It would also jeopardize the fragile peace between Israel and Egypt. She scoffed at the notion… until she read they’re now going to allow husbands to hump their dead wives up to six hours after death, women can do the same (stick a toothpick in it?), minimum age of marriage lowered to 14, and women lose their right to jobs and education [LINK]. That elicited a very rare mea culpa from her. I am not going to lie… that made my day!

In granting vouchers, it must be assumed that a select few bookstores are authorized to redeem such vouchers. And from the collection of these vouchers, the lucky bookstores are allowed to claim from the government the money due to them. How then should the selection of the bookstores be done or has the government identified the participating bookstores? Are the book vouchers a mere proxy scam to withdraw money out of public coffers to enrich a select few during a time when the economy is slumping?
The IMI is designed to track housing markets throughout the country that are showing signs of improving economic health. The index measures three sets of independent monthly data to get a mark on the top improving Metropolitan Statistical Areas. The three indicators that are analyzed are employment growth from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, house price appreciation from Freddie Mac, and single-family housing permit growth from the U.S. Census Bureau. NAHB uses the latest available data from these sources to generate a list of improving markets. A metro area must see improvement in all three areas for at least six months following their respective troughs before being included on the improving markets list.

Nilovic was born in Montenegro in 1941, and was formally trained as a musician at the age of five. He moved to France in 1960, where he was introduced to more contemporary musical styles, which would have a profound influence on his career and musical output. Eventually he started composing music for production music libraries in the 1960s, beginning with the Telemusic label. A few years later he would go on to compose the majority of work in his catalog for the Montparnasse 2000 label. Janko Nilovic signed a contract with Montparnasse 2000 which guaranteed him absolute freedom in his musical experiments.
In general discussions on literature with Gunay Sadhikova a friend from Ajerbaijan, she pointed out the importance of the unspoken. It was important for a writer not to tell his audience too much and leave something for the imagination. (Of course the problem can be the other way around where the meaning of a work of art is so obscure or hidden that it is intelligible to only a select few if at all.) In a play on AIDS however I had to tilt more towards reducing concealment and stating things clearly. I do not believe this has impacted negatively on the work.
A week ago I was browsing some shops in the city just to see if there was any new stuff in. I saw this new brand that was very very cheap (less than 1$ per bottle) and then it hit me. I should look for a blue-toned red since the price was right for me to experiment and there were a lot of red shades to choose from. I chose one that looked ok in the light of the shop (although you can never know with these). I was very pleased with the outcome!
I didn’t want to leave my edges naked so I pulled my Shabby shutter’s green pad (Distress Inks). I am trying to make more use of my distress inks…they were a little lonely in the corner of my room lol. My tiny pearls, including the tiny tiny pearl earrings on Lil’ Gilli Jeans. DPs are from recollection and Authentique papers.
“Donald Rumsfeld was on President Reagan’s transition team and the day after he took office he appointed an FDA Commissioner who would approve aspartame. The FDA set up a Board of Inquiry of the best scientists they had to offer who said aspartame is not safe and causes brain tumors, and the petition for approval is hereby revoked. The new FDA Commissioner, Arthur Hull Hayes, over-ruled that Board of Inquiry and then went to work for the PR Agency of the manufacturer, Burson-Marstellar, rumored at $1000.00 a day, and has refused to talk to the press ever since.”
On an aside…don’t tell me that being a stay at home mom or dad is easy unless you are one and don’t tell me that you’re going to make it easier to be a working mum unless you have your pen in your hand, ready to sign on the dotted line. I’d be rich if daycare were more reasonable…
All of this judgment did not get sin out of the world… Judgment does not destroy sin… Only the blood of Jesus takes sin out of people and nations. The sword… the earthquakes… the tornadoes… the floods cannot destroy sin out of a nation… only repentance takes away those judgments. Judgment is simply… “God executing justice upon mankind”… God is the Judge of the whole earth… When mankind sins… God holds both the nations and each individual man responsible. The Bible teaches both the blessing and the cursing of God (Deuteronomy 27-28)… Note two mountains… Gerizim and Ebal… Each mount took of the law with them… Balance… The church that “amen’s” the blessings only, and does not “amen” the curse that disobedience brings, is out of balance. Today in our nation… when preachers preach strongly against the sins of the nation, the crowds applaud and shout their “amen’s”… When that same preacher preaches against the sins of the Christians, there is a deep silence. When Amos told of God’s roaring against the heathen, Israel loved it… but it was a different story when he told of God’s roar against them.
After the holidays, both need attention. I need to cook up some freezer breakfasts and meals for the remaining basketball season. If I have healthier alternatives available to both my teenage son and me, we will eat better.
How differently would your life be if you were strong enough to be consistent? Have you made choices that you regret, but you were under pressure and felt like you had to react? Would your relationships be better if you weren’t so moved by people not living up to your expectations? Would you be living life at a higher level if you were more motivated?
As you can see I've at least had time to do my 2nd year anniversary makeover. That's right BW has hit its 2 year anniversary mark. I feel really happy where my blog is. However, I feel horrible that besides a new look BW has been dead for over a month now.
I'm so glad I tried this recipe, because it will be made over and over again. Thanks for sharing this with us Anita. If your a scallops lover, I hope you'll enjoy this recipe also. Enjoy!

Mintz: Not partners. That's your first lesson. Cuts your score in half right down the middle. Worse than that, you take a partner, you put an apple on your head and hand the other guy a shotgun. Grifters, huh? You're one all right. Grifters got an irresistible urge to beat a guy who's wise. There's nothing to whipping a fool. Hell, fools are made to be whipped. But, to take another pro, even your partner, who knows you, and has his eye on you, that's a score, no matter what happens."
I really want a meatball sub. I will be out at lunch time tomorrow because I have appointments, every time I have this appointment, I wait until I get home to eat lunch because I can’t eat lunch earlier. So I am absolutely starving, but wait until I get home and eat lunch at 3pm. Just because I cannot walk into a cafe, or restaurant, or safe takeout like subway. WHY?! Ugh.
When the drawings or photographs of the claimed design in the subsequent application in China are not completely consistent with those of the first foreign application, or the subsequent application in China contains a brief explanation while the first foreign application does not have the related brief explanation, but based on the application documents of the two, the claimed design in the subsequent application in China has been clearly shown in the first foreign application, it may be determined that the claimed design in the subsequent application in China has the same subject matter as that of the design in the first foreign application, and thus may enjoy the priority of the latter.”

As she worked me hard and fast with her hand and cranked me up to the height of arousal by sucking my nipple, I lost control. The quivering started deep inside of me. It was a deep urgent tickling sensation that told me that I was at the point of no return. The tickle grew and grew and soon it became a demand that would not be denied. I moaned that I was going to cum as my body stiffened. As she held my cock head and flicked my nipple back and forth in her mouth with her tongue, my cock swelled and hurled several heavy ropes of thick white cum.
One of the things I value from the best filmmakers is the kind of empathetic awareness of human foible that Rohmer seemed to always exude even when his characters could sometimes drive you up the wall with the intellectualizing of their innermost faiths and passions. But that, of course, was Rohmer's great universal subject, at least judging by the films of his I've seen: the distance between intellect and passion, between what one says and what one thinks. Despite films like My Night at Maud's (1969) and Love in the Afternoon (1972) being among the ones lumped under the "Moral Tales" moniker, they were never simplistic or facile in their morals; Rohmer's gaze was by turns ironic, affectionate, detached and exploratory, but above all, it was remarkably alert to the sometimes problematic ways we human beings try to reconcile the warring factions of heart and mind. Even his films themselves embody this dialectic to their very core: talky and intelligent, yes, but also aesthetically beautiful to behold (witness Nestor Almendros's lustrous color photography in Claire's Knee (1970) and Diane Baratier's in Astréa and Celadon for remarkable examples).
We have been here on Hilton Head Island since Sunday. I have several friends here that we intended to call, and visit or take to dinner, but we really have just “vegged out”. We haven’t been to the pool at all (Last time we were here we did and hour of water aerobics every day), We have shopped at the discount malls, wandered around, and parked in front of books and of the TVs in every room (except the bathrooms). We really couldn’t swim, because Janet just had surgery on her hand and the Dr.forbid her from getting her cast wet.
I now get divine wisdom on money matters from my creator.
How are things going with you guys. Hope everyone has been doing okay since I have been away. Maybe I will get back to a somewhat normal routine now.

The faux patina background starts out with an embossing folder - I tried several, and the ones that worked best were the cuttlebug harlequin pattern I used here and the SU vintage wallpaper, which both have smallish overall patterns that are fairly deeply embossed. The folder was inked with SU crumbcake ink before embossing, so you have an embossed white image on a pale background - I embossed twice to get a large enough piece of card. The card was then inked all over with distress inks, starting with tumbled glass and peeled paint, ending with vintage photo. After a few hours drying on a storage heater, I dabbed a versamark pad over the card, and embossed with detail gold EP - the random effect does mean that the background got a bit inked too, but it looked ok.
So I am asking myself, what I am doing, how I am praying, who I am being that would ensure that His kingdom come and that His will is done on earth as it is in heaven. AND I am crying out for mercy and grace because frankly I am really not doing much to advance the kingdom in my little neck of the woods.

Professor: I guess you’ll have to take them on faith, son.
I have never had a passion for grammar. In fact, I find it extremely boring. I felt the same way when I was in school and remember dreading the times we would study grammar exclusively. As a 5th grade teacher I never taught grammar on its own, but instead took problem areas my students were facing in their writing and focused on those issues instead in mini lessons. I now teach English to adult students from all over the world who are learning English. For the past ten years when I have taught grammar to adults, it has only been a portion of what I teach, so I haven't minded because I love teaching conversation, writing, and listening. However, in October I added a teaching position to my resume at a new school. At this school I am exclusively the grammar teacher. My students come to me for grammar and go to another teacher for projects like conversation, writing, etc.

I became interested in this anime after seeing the above picture of Hyouka, which portrays it as a refreshing, upbeat type of school anime, so I was surprised to find that the main character, Oreki Hotaro, is a quiet sort of guy who mainly keeps to himself. His dismal-sounding motto is, “I don’t do anything I don’t have to do. What I have to do, I do quickly.” It actually seems like a pretty good way to live until you realize that instead of just giving up unnecessary recreations to focus on more important things, Hotaro actually gives up bothering with academics, sports, and socializing – basically anything that a high school student could focus on.
…We must understand the meaning of relationships with Kṛṣṇa. In this material world we have many relationships as father, mother, wife or husband. Whatever relationship we find here is but a perverted reflection of the relationship we have with the Supreme Lord. Whatever we find in this material world is born of the Absolute Truth, but here it is pervertedly reflected in time. Whatever relationship we have with Kṛṣṇa goes on. If we have a relationship in friendship, that friendship is eternal and continues from life to life. In the material world, a friendship exists for a few years and then breaks; therefore it is called perverted, temporal, or unreal. If we make our friendship with Kṛṣṇa, it will never break. If we make our master Kṛṣṇa, we will never be cheated. If we love Kṛṣṇa as our son, He will never die. If we love Kṛṣṇa as our lover, He will be the best of all, and there will be no separation. Because Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord, He is unlimited and has an unlimited number of devotees. Some are trying to love Him as lover or husband, and therefore Kṛṣṇa accepts this role. In whatever way we approach Kṛṣṇa, He will accept us, as He states in Bhagavad-gītā.
Yesterday as I was pouring 50 pounds of rock salt on the road leading down the hill to my driveway-snowed in since Thursday- I had a bit of an epiphany. It’s funny how these things are right in front of us but we fail to pay the proper attention. I’ve been dancing around a couple of issues for a while, but it took snow to get the light bulb glowing.

One of my favorite characters that Michael Moorcock created was Elric the 428th sorcerer emperor of Melnibone. Being an albino, he's a sickly king who is kept alive through drugs and sorcery. He's charged with keeping many traditions, many so vile and cruel it makes Drow look civilized. He's also deeply in love with Cymoril who is his cousin. An unlikely character for swords & sorcery fiction. Through the course of the series, Elric finds himself at odds with the evil ways of his people, and his cousin Yrkoon who has been plotting to take the throne by force or treachery.
This time I'm actually asking for one of my 12 year old library patrons. She inspired this feature, so it seems fitting to me to kick off the first post by searching for a recommendation for her. She gave me an adorable thank you card for introducing her to the series, and after blinking back my tears of joy I vowed to help her find more books like this.
One Pakatan Rakyat State Assemblyman, Yew Tian Hoe, said Hee had sprayed him with pepper spray. It appears obvious she will need much more than pepper spray to defend her honour. Her name is destined to become a term of abuse, much as “Quisling” entered the English language to mean traitor, after the name of the despised Norwegian turncoat Vidkun Quisling. Hee’s name may yet find its way into common usage. Her name is likely to become synonymous with an expletive, because of the widespread tendency on the Internet, to combine her name with foul language.
I can’t decide which idea is more insane — letting the states take over Social Security, or allowing young people to make their own Social Security financial decisions. I mean, over the long haul, states have an absolutely abysmal track record when it comes to handling their own finances (see appendix E, “California, Illinois and New Jersey, 2011″), whereas jumping to the wild conclusion that 30-year-olds will suddenly become financially responsible simply staggers the mind.

This is fun for me because I included some of my favorite things. Suffocation, Donna Summer, Sun Ra and Ashra? Fuck, what more could you ask for. I mean other than Godflesh & Sepultura? It was kind of cool to play with songs as colors and textures as part of a larger picture rather than overanalyzing song structures or harmonic construction. So what I’m saying is that I’ve decided to become the coolest new DJ, so hit me up if your party needs more punkstep, garage bass, acid jungle, deep hypno, or gibber gabber.
As we gathered by the bus at 6:15am, a student turned to my husband and asked, incredulously, “You ski? I thought you would spend your weekends at home reading a book or something.” Zach replied with dignity: “Yes, I ski,” while I snickered behind a mitten at the boy’s uncannily accurate description of 95% of our weekends.

So tonight I got on Kate DiCamillo's website and clicked around. N is the kind of girl who knows I'll be on duty again tomorrow and will come wanting to know if I have anything new to share with her. The best thing I found, though, was a list of tips for writers that Kate has on her website. It made me think of N, and somehow, I have an easy time imagining her growing up to be the kind of writer whose books make young readers cry their eyes out and come back for more.
They realize that this arrest doesn’t come anywhere near stopping the problem.
About six or seven years ago, a friend asked if I had read them because they were very good. I had never even heard of them. Then I mentioned it to another friend who said he had also read them and they were very good. I checked out some reviews, they were very good. So if they were very good, I can probably assume they are worth reading. So I bought the trilogy and guess what? They are very good.
10. Pinnacle: 22-20 vs. Mountain Ridge
Hollow Pike started as a nugget of an idea back in early 2009. I had just concluded an on-going serial in a local magazine and needed something to sink my teeth into. At the time I was teaching Year 6 pupils and had already become a fan of the ever-growing YA genre. To me, some of the freshest writing seemed to be in this area – grown up books without the boring bits.

7) Wear your pride when you go out. Eating dinner out with friends on Friday evening? Wear your Star Wars t-shirt! If you don’t have one – then bring your toy light saber in your purse, or attach it to your belt! (Well, that may get you in trouble so I’m not responsible if people think you’re carrying a weapon…) I don’t have a Star Wars shirt (yet! I need to order one!) but I have a storm trooper button that I can put on my shirt, and that’s good enough for me!
I had the honor of creating bouquets for the bride as well as for her two bridesmaids, boutonnieres and the bride’s lovely bandeau-style veil. Each piece was created from vintage red bridesmaid gowns (something old and something new, of course!). Ashleigh’s beautiful bouquet also featured vintage pearls at the center of each rosette. Her frock was made of ivory silk chiffon and she donned different shoes for the wedding and reception (a girl after my own heart).
I got a kick out of showing my students this aspect of my life and relished the opportunity to play a skatepunk masterpiece for them. Each class seemed to appreciate my efforts, despite their general aversion to the sound of the song itself. And they seemed to work the rest of the class period, filling out the charts and thinking about what they would say about themselves.

I quickly plopped myself down with my laptop and started ganking photos off the web. I found a plethora of classics: Johnny Cash, David Bowie, George Carlin and about 20 others. I narrowed it down to 18 with one female – Jane Fonda in her classic “power to the people” pose. I shot the images, one by one, to my wireless printer…while comfortably plopped down on my bed. (I did have to make a quick trip to Ikea for frames on my lunch hour one day, but even that took me less than a half hour round trip).

They're beautiful and fascinating. They're totally opposite--one dark and the other one light. A Rebel and a Guardian--both were sent to watch Skye. Asher is cocky, flirty, always confident and always hot. And he's dangerous too. Devin, on the other hand is serious, always exuding calmness. He always look so peaceful and confident but in totally different way than Asher. They're opposite but both of them are intriguing and fascinating. Even I couldn't figure out well who to trust and love more. It's hard to choose between the two, and I don't blame Skye for being so confused. Eventually, Asher won my heart, but I still care for Devin. Sigh... You'll doubt and love them both at the same time...

Remember, where ever you’re living, every city is teeming with awesome people waiting for the eruption of positive energy and creativity, make that eruption happening, make sure it’s going to be loud, make sure it’s going to be fun, inspiring, and awesome or thought provoking for we shall not fall into a daily grind that entraps us in boredom and lack of originality. The IDEACUBE project is one major idea and so many more are floating around us inviting us to be part in the process that contributes to our cultures and societies. We don’t always need to reinvent the wheel but we can replicate ideas in our own context, to give them new shapes and to reconnect them together with like-minded people sharing the common goal of making the best out of life whilst amplifying the good in our societies.
We have to do it ourselves or it just wont get done, we have a sparky and a good plumber but everything else is up to us, the planning, the ordering, the demolishing, the tiling/waterproofing, re plastering etc etc.. my head is spinning.

She told me that being a blogger gives her the right to post whatever she wants about whomever she wants, and she has no idea why I would be remotely hurt since she has never actually 'said my name' in a blog post. She said I am only looking to be offended and draw attention to myself, and that I 'should have known' that the photo of me would end up on her blog. I have only said one thing to her via facebook when I asked her to remove my photo from her hurtful post about me, which I then quickly deleted, and yet she claims I keep attacking her. I have only briefly and respectfully responded to her blog post in her comments. She told me I am no longer 'welcome' to read her blog, while she freely blogs about me. I find it interesting that she is so hurt and upset over my few sentence response to her that I promptly deleted, yet she can't understand why I would be hurt by 3 whole negative blog posts about me... in which several of our mutual friends see what she writes. Logically, it just does not make any sense. Here is my ultimate point in even speaking up here:
We may experiment in the next few months with putting up shade cloth over parts of the garden to see if the plants fair better. Our strawberries did much better last summer after we put up the shade cloth. Otherwise we were losing plants every week, and not from lack of water. It was actual burn out.
Cretin!
Today she started it up as well. I pulled her out of her cell and placed her in a holding cell with a camera in it. A Sgt came in and I told him what I was doing. He said that we had to notify medical on all breathing problems and they will make the determination if she is faking or needs to be transported. I told him I know this and what the SOP is but if you watch her on the camera you will see what I’m talking about. He says no call medical. So I did and she requests to be transported to the hospital. I’m thinking hell no, one because she is faking, the other is that I’ll have to go with her. Her request is approved and the Lt advises that we will just file on her out of custody. This means that we are just going to let her go and file a warrant to make sure she comes back. I’m relieved that I don’t have to go with her but she is clearly faking just to get out. Sure enough she gets loaded up in the ambulance and a block down the street she is released. Damn that’s EMS guys are good. It sure does seem like the patient always has a miraculous recovery at about the same spot ever time.

Remember I don’t track very well when I’m scared. That is, after all, the reason I wrote the book in the first place. Dr. Gettleman gave me the information I asked for and explained it to me as I sat there dumbly. Then I barraged him with questions about what he’d said concerning liver exiting and kidney exiting drugs.
It seemed like only a matter of time before chain stores set their sights on the somewhat desolate strip of real estate at Brooklyn's Fulton Mall. Joining Aeropostale and H&M—both of which should be opening soon—Filene's Basement/Syms announced it will open its first Brooklyn store at the Fulton Mall in early 2012.
Last year I made a feijoa chutney, which I speculate was invented by someone who was very sick of feijoas. It was more like a Branston pickle, sharp, dark and malty, and I still have masses of it left. This year I decided to try a jam instead. And since feijoa isn't exactly my favourite fruit, I thought of zesting it up with some ginger for interest. This is my first attempt, based loosely on a recipe found on the net somewhere random. If I do this again next year, I'll add even more ginger.

As many of us know, October is all about the boobs and this year we celebrate National Breast Cancer Awareness Month’s 25 year anniversary. More than just a time to don your pretty pink ribbons, it’s a time to become better educated about risks, treatments, and preventative measures against breast cancer as well as a time to celebrate the strength, resilience and for some, the memory, of those who fight and have fought this disease.

Anyway, I did a little better with the 2003 Studio Dodgers. Here are three cards I needed. Funny, the same guy seems to be standing in the background of all three players! How did he stand there for so long? ... What? ... Oh ... It's a cheap studio backdrop, like at a photo studio? OK, I get it.

Heat oil in the same skillet you used for the veggies, also over med-heat. Add onions and saute about 2 minutes. Add black beans – mash them with a fork until they break up but retain some of their texture. Stir in spices and continue to saute for about 4 minutes. Add water and mix well (you should have something with the consistency of refried beans by the time you’re done). Remove from heat.

What was Nancy’s crime that got the Liberal blogosphere all incensed? She and her Christian husband had the audacity to adopt a 2 year old, 14 pound Ethiopian girl and rescue her from certain death. As far as the Leftosphere is concerned, it would have been better for Naomi, the black emaciated Ethiopian girl, to have died than to be raised by white Christian Conservative adoptive parents!

If you missed the PM crudely waving 2 cannisters of oil and announcing that God is a Trini, then surely you heard the non-stop radio ads announcing the Jubiliee Discovery by Petrotrin all day Friday and Saturday….or maybe you managed to miss Couva North MP Ramona Ramdial on CNC3 Friday evening announce that we have an oil boom. It’s not uncommon for oil to be found off our shores…it’s how we’ve been making a living in Trinidad and Tobago for about a century. But last Thursday our leader of Government revealed just how desperate she is to give Trinbagonians hope in their economic future as well as to distract them from the chaos that is her government.
I was happily surprised to see on that Isaac’s book is also being adapted to film. Unlike Brooks’ “fiction2film,” Marion’s appears to be more of a direct adaption than a variation on the story. Although director Jonathan Levine is writing the script, he consulted with Marion during the process.
The workers there remember Max... "the cranky, goofy dog with the squeaky ball in his mouth"... and Daisy is so totally opposite of him.... sweet, cooperative, lets them draw blood, hold her for an echo and chest x-ray and generally prod and poke at will. I hope she can rest better tonight, but I know she must wonder where her "people" are and if we are ever coming back... she's been through this trauma before... at the kill shelter in South Carolina.
So, with really no extra time to speak of to come up with my brilliant idea of how to put these seemingly worthless scraps to good use, they accumulate. We've had this machine for nearly 5 years. That's a lot of scrap! And I wonder if maybe my husband, in his attempt to straighten the studio up (my perpetual state of chaos) has either inadvertantly...or maybe not so inadvertantly....tossed bags of these without my knowing. If I ever find out he's done this...it's the dog house for him! (You've been warned, Chief!)
So I have discovered two things that seem to make me think a lot more critically:
The day started out with an unexpected surprise. I was chatting online with a good friend of mine (whom I’ll call “L”) when she said she had a surprise ready for me and wanted to bring it over that day. She was pretty adamant that she bring it that day, which piqued my interest. So, about an hour or so later, she presented me with this lovely spirit box:
speaking of scandinavian obsessions, I just got my second book by trina hahnemann - after "the scandinavian cookbook" I am now a happy owner of "the nordic diet". they're both amazing in many ways and I'm afraid words won't do them justice, so let me just say that if you're a fan of that simple, clean and fresh scandi vibe, you would love them.
