Nationally, data show the jobless are disproportionately black and young. Many college students fled to graduate school as a safe haven, only to find equally bad job prospects when they emerged, deeper in debt.

øInstead, she freelances between two or three big clients at a time. This allows her to spend time with her young ones and sharpen her skills along the way. And just last week, one of her clients offered her a great new gig, one that will use her skills in new ways, and she couldn't be happier. (And she gets to work after 8 p.m., when the kids go to bed.)

SACRAMENTO The new USC study pointing to a much-slower rate of population growth in California has been greeted by demographers and urban planners as good news, in that it supposedly gives our state's leaders a little breathing room to better plan for the future. The rate of growth has slowed to about 1 percent a year, the result of fewer immigrants coming here and many Californians heading to other states.
"I know people are pushing for me to make dramatic changes yesterday," Wheeler says. "If that means I have to take a few extra weeks to do it, so be it."

Though the beautiful new homes of Vintage are located in the heart of sweeping vineyards, they offer proximity to schools, the Livermore Valley's friendly tasting rooms of more than 40 world-class wineries, community parks, hiking and biking trails, Lake Del Valle, and easy access to Interstates 580 and 680, Highway 84, BART and ACE Transit. Additionally, Vintage is just around the corner from Livermore's charming downtown with inviting restaurants, shops and entertainment venues.

The story goes back before Prohibition, but is causing controversy today. According to federal law, for a wine to be called Zinfandel or any other varietal name, it must contain at least 75% wine from that grape. The law is designed to protect consumers, but one consequence is that it has created several generations of American wine drinkers who believe a varietal wine is always better than a blend.

Vas was convicted Oct. 8 in U.S. District Court in Newark of using his influence as mayor of Perth Amboy to make nearly $300,000 from a property sale by promising the buyer $350,000 in city redevelopment funds. He was also convicted of accepting illegal campaign contributions for his 2006 congressional campaign.
There were no blockbuster Internet IPOs and just one Web deal (Google's purchase of YouTube) valued at more than $1 billion in the past year. But the flood of money and flurry of activity prompts the question: Is Web 2.0 another bubble or are the startups getting funded today more sound than ones created in the run-up to the last bust?
It's been up and down, Petty said behind his trademark dark sunglasses and beneath his familiar feathered hat. It's not been steady like it should be, but we see hope.
"I'm a bit disappointed quite frankly," Congressman Danny K. Davis told me Monday after learning of Smith's comments. "I would have hoped that Rep.

"In this political environment, what I haven't always been successful at doing is breaking through the noise and speaking directly to the American people," Obama conceded to an interviewer last week. This is his chance — speeches like this one can draw 30 million to 50 million viewers, sometimes more.
A close friend sent me an intemperate e-mail several days ago about the move to revitalize what he called St. Louis's "burned out" neighborhoods. His message was inspired by the report that McEagle Properties was trying to purchase 1,233 parcels of city-owned land as part of an $8 billion, two-square-mile redevelopment project.
"Presently, the prevailing kind of view in the public is that the war on terror is so important that we're going to condone aggressive government conduct," said Geoffrey Mearns, a former assistant U.S. Attorney who helped prosecute one of the Oklahoma City bombers.

Rauh argues that pension liabilities should be valued using a risk-free interest rate, like the yield on U.S. Treasury bonds. The 10-year Treasury yielded 3.6 percent in mid-2009, and that has fallen to 1.99 percent today. State and local governments typically use a much higher discount rate, like 8 percent, making their official liability figures much smaller than Rauh's estimates.

Satellite cities that never ended up with populations aren't Spain's only problem. Around Madrid and across the country, there are vast subdivisions carved out of farmland complete with paved roads and streetlights but only weeds where houses were supposed to be built. Half-built apartment buildings stand idle in suburbs rich and poor.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 1.47, or 0.2 percent, to 879.56 and the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.00, or 0.1 percent, to 1,747.17. Both the Dow and S&P 500 hit levels not seen since May 1.
The Collinsville school board has narrowed its list of superintendent candidates to six. A hiring could come as soon as late next month, an official said.

Although the state is broadly in charge of assessments, it is Baltimore City and the counties who bear the brunt of such mistakes; the state portion of property taxes is much lower than the local share. And in Baltimore, where revenues chronically fall short and the tax rate is twice as high as anywhere else in Maryland, the consequences of those mistakes are so much the greater.

Musk, who Stringer has approached about using Plum Brook, "has made the decision he'd rather fly and learn from flying, and he's right," Stringer said, as long as the company has the time and money to rebound from any problems that result. After three launch failures, SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket reached orbit in September 2008, and its larger Falcon 9 had a successful first flight in June 2010.
But even if the machines take over, they'll still need some people to prune, fumigate and tell which fruit are ripe, Rajan believes.
"That's a decision that only the season is going to dictate what goes on after this," Smith said. "I think that's the way it is in the coaching profession. You better get used to that being in the coaching profession, because there's never going to be anything guaranteed down the road, as you know. You could goof it up and all the sudden you're out the door."
Gay rights are regularly sliced into multiple wedge issues at election time. How gay marriage is folded into the presidential campaign will be a good barometer for how far America's views have shifted -- perhaps far more than Obama's statement itself, though its appearance as the general election season begins is hard not to notice.
News International has had to fight off allegations that it tried to destroy emails and other evidence of widespread phone hacking and other illegal news-gathering methods, such as paying public officials for information.

Andy Pettitte’s “On My Way Back to the Bronx” Tour made its way through the state capital Wednesday night. But what was billed earlier in the day as just another laid-back set for the soon-to-be 40-year-old left-hander got amped up many decibels when news began to spread that the Yankees had lost Michael Pineda for the season.
He said tracking allows those disconnected from the Mini to become actively involved. And he's not afraid of malfunctions.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who is now the ultimate boss of CPD, should add his own voice to such a request. Surely, he cannot be happy with a cop shop that misplaces its own homicide files.
But the public won’t get to see the critical details until Democrats settle an internal squabble over whether the package should include a special tax on millionaires, a measure that Christie has vetoed twice and vowed to do again. Polls show that the tax is popular, but its inclusion would likely jeopardizes the party’s effort to deliver tax relief to middle-class families, said the sources who are not authorized to speak publicly about the proposal.
McInnis has raised the issue that the current governor, Democrat Bill Ritter, is from Denver as is the lieutenant governor and state treasurer, and a number of cabinet directors.

We've spent so much time this year talking about Flacco's flaws -- he's slow when he drops back, he doesn't throw anticipation routes very often, he's occasionally too laid back -- we probably don't talk enough about what he does well. He still has a big strong arm, he's tall enough that he can create his own throwing lanes, and he isn't afraid to get hit as he's releasing the ball. Those are all qualities that seem to come out when he's in the shotgun. Maybe he plays better in the shotgun because it's similar to the system he learned in college at Delaware, and maybe he's just more comfortable doing it because it takes him so long to set up when he drops back from under center. It doesn't really matter why it works, just that it does.

In waging this fight, they stand between the president and the success of a vast rewrite of financial regulations that Obama is determined to sign into law. A House version of the bill already excludes auto dealers from new consumer financial rules; by standing firm now, the administration hopes the Senate version prevails.
Typhoon's legal problems in recent years have all but eclipsed the mark the restaurant made on Portland's dining scene when it first opened in the mid-'90s. In its initial review of the restaurant in 1996, The Oregonian noted that many of the appetizers and main dishes were unlike anything you could get from other Thai restaurants in town, which at the time served standard dishes like pad Thai and drunken noodles. But Typhoon's menu has become more-Americanized as the chain expanded throughout the state and into Washington over the years. And Typhoon has been eclipsed by a number of newer Thai restaurants that serve street-style food that's less expensive and more rooted in what's happening in Thai cuisine today. Typhoon hasn't been prominently featured in Diner, The Oregonian's annual guide to Portland's best restaurants, since 2006.

Another part of the current housing puzzle is distressed properties. Or, in 2012, "Where's the rush of foreclosures that were purported to come swamp the market?"
There's even a sensible explanation. For years I've been recommending that readers drink low-alcohol German Rieslings during hot summer months. If adding a couple of cubes to a 14 percent-alcohol Chardonnay will chill it down and bring it to, say, 9 or 10 percent, then I say, "Winner, winner, chicken dinner!"

There are two basic counter-arguments to this, and they've already been raised by opponents. First, that the economy is so bad right now that any tax increase ought to be postponed until times are better. The other is that a transportation tax increase, particularly a gas tax increase, is undeserved because governors and lawmakers have so frequently "robbed" the Transportation Trust Fund to pay for general fund needs in past years.
Dixon's organization is an unsecured creditor that will get pennies, if anything, on the dollar. It's owed about $100,000 on $175,000 in loans it made to Peek'n Peak in 2007.
"I'm excited to get back in the film room," he said. "I'm going to get film sent to me, and I'll watch it on my computer when I get home.

Seth, No. Felton doesn't want to come back here, and Andre doesn't want to go back there, and the teams aren't going to revisit that deal. Andre, I think, has worn down, and George Karl should cut down his minutes. He had to play too much when Ty Lawson got hurt.

If it's a foreclosure, the bank is likely to welcome a decent offer, he said.
Those growing markets are, in particular, China and India. They're the reason why coal companies including Arch and Peabody are looking to expand coal export capacity in the U.S. Peabody, the largest U.S. coal producer, has also invested billions of dollars in Australia to more directly tap Asia's appetite for energy.

The commonality of the observance is obvious. It is also obvious that the environment is permeated with a sense of peace on earth and good will to each other. The vehicle for this is the light of the candles and the decorations. Perhaps this is the illumination referred to in Genesis 6:16. We hope that in the year to come we can keep the spirit of all these celebrations, and have their light penetrate our lives. Can we make this illumination overcome the differences in which text we read and how we understand and lead us to closer to the source of the light? I pray that the lights of each of our observations combine to enlighten our lives and our practices for all of 2012.

James’ list of accomplishments is long and impressive, and he will leave Oregon as one of the most decorated players in Pac-12 history. He owns numerous Oregon records and on Friday set one of his own, the type someone else will aim to break in the future: James became the first player in conference history with three 1,500 yard rushing seasons, an impressive feat in a league that has featured running backs like O.J. Simpson, Marcus Allen and Reggie Bush. And true to form, he went out with a typical LaMichael James performance, finishing with 219 yards and three touchdowns on 25 carries.

It is possible for husbands to nag, and wives to resent them for nagging. But women are more likely to nag, experts say, largely because they are conditioned to feel more responsible for managing home and family life.

The problem is that by asking repeatedly, they make things worse.

Almost nothing has been heard this long primary season from the Republican candidates for president about the last GOP occupant of the Oval Office, George W. Bush.

Through a massive tax hike that will hit every Californian, "MariaCare" hopes to reduce a so-called "hidden tax" caused by uninsured patients who apparently have nothing better to do than sit around emergency rooms consuming treatment for which the rest of us pay.

Whose questionable decisions have decreased our world power and economic strength? Dunn doesn’t say. He very shrewdly leaves the blank to be filled in by the reader.

Ireland's "Celtic Tiger" leaders wagered they could sustain economic growth via unregulated banking, construction and loose mortgages embracing crony capitalism. In 2008, this crashed as banks were found to be insolvent. After guaranteeing banks, Ireland faced a sovereign debt crisis that forced its turn to a European Union and International Monetary Fund bailout in December -- a bailout that might reach more than $100 billion, at an unsustainable interest rate. The government introduced severe budget cuts, and Ireland is now in a deflationary spiral combined with 14 percent unemployment and mass emigration.
But Muti hasn't conducted in Southern California since a visiting stint with the Philadelphians in the 1980s.

The sheet is then wrapped around the guest, who is lowered onto a heated waterbed. Hay baths are believed to relieve joint and muscle pain and stimulate the metabolism.

Turns out, Ross had little reason to worry. Bennett, then a scrawny 6-foot-3 athlete with a knack for making quick decisions, went in against Birmingham and “totally managed the game for us.” From there, it only got better: Bennett helped Crespi to huge win after huge win — including a victory over a Mater Dei team led by future USC quarterback Matt Barkley — and took the Celts to the divisional championship.

Stempleman's writing is a physical phenomenon, drawing from science as much as the literary tradition.
So what? Again, that's what a market is. Some companies fail. Some companies get overvalued. Some companies get undervalued. Some become profitable, some don't. The fact that unprofitable companies exist, and that some go public, doesn't mean we're in a bubble. It means that we live on Planet Earth.
Finding state schools inadequate, parents spend millions on tutoring. Children study in after-school academies, known as "hagwon," until 11 p.m. and beyond.

The Trader Vic's company contracted through the 1990s, but has rebounded over the past decade with new outposts in far-flung locales from Saudi Arabia to Kazakhstan. There are currently 26 restaurants worldwide. With the expansion has come criticism that some of the franchises have lacked Bergeron's original flair. A Bellevue, Wash., location that opened at the end of 2005 was advertised, like Portland's, as a nostalgic return to the old days. It folded within three years.

Hey, Tony: As a long-time fan, it's painful to watch this year's version of the Browns. So, tell me if this is the reality of the situation to ease my mind: The focus this year is NOT on winning but on evaluating the current roster to establish a draft and F/A wish list at the end of the season, and for the coaches to settle in to their roles. As much as the fans want to win now, the Holmgren/Heckert regime will need a couple of years to undo the debacle of the past decade in order to form a team of solid players to fit the new offensive and defensive schemes. If this is the case, I can accept the poor performances and won't feel like I'm wasting my Sunday afternoons in a sports bar. -- Ken Knapp, Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.
