We were sad. Those trees were hand-picked by the landscaper to highlight the edges of our garden. They were expensive, but we had made the decision to part with that money for the beauty it would bring to our yard. We mourned, but got over it and moved on…
Before 'uptown' St. Patrick's, there was downtown St. Patrick's, the original cathedral which was consecrated in 1815. By the 1850s, with the number of Catholics growing due to immigration, a larger, grander structure was required, one that reflect the congregants' growing influence. The image below is from St. Patrick's before the 1866 fire. The facade was rebuilt with less ornamentation.

What is a setting in a film? A background upon which unifying perspectives and functions and events and plots intertwine and unfold. Why does a character have to open a door and end up in the next room? Film has freed us from this need. Why not end up in the same room as one started in? Or in a forest? Just as we need to realize that plot and character are artificial unities when it comes to film, so it is with setting. Why does the same room need to always have the same furniture? Why not change it to fit the mood of the scene or the characters?

Prepared to fully enjoy every minute of the last weekend of summer, and the last long weekend before the holidays, to the fullest - I had been excited to see the inaugural Los Angeles Times Celebration of Food & Wine event set for Sunday, and really wanted to like it and hoped for it to be an event to look forward to every year.

I’m disappointed that the AGCO has decided to act this way, using the letter and not the spirit of the law to guide their decision-making, but ultimately I understand that they may not have had a choice once the complaint was lodged. I would have rathered more consultation from them or that they refused the delivery license application when they were informed how the service would work. If that had happened, at least Corey and Kyle, the two youths who had been hired to start this service, wouldn’t have had their hopes lifted and then let down in such a dramatic way.

Cream butter and peanut butter together with a mixer. Gradually add the confectioners sugar. Add a little more until the mixture is not too stick and you can shape. I mix some confectioners sugar and cornstarch together to keep on my hands when shaping. I found one of my measuring spoons shaped in an egg-shape and kept dipping that in the powdered mixer and made a perfect egg shape. I place in refrigerator for about 1 hour before dipping in chocolate.

You are truly no different from your neighbor or even from those you perceive to be too unawakened or too steeped in their beliefs which you perceive to be judgmental. Indeed, the beliefs that so many on your world follow can be seen as judgmental but at the same time, these souls truly and strongly believe in what they are bringing forth at any given moment which is why it is so difficult for one to reach a soul who is a bit too deeply ingrained in the beliefs of separation between humanity.

Intelligent Design is much easier to explain and it only takes one day out of the curriculum, which means all that time saved can be used to teach kids more important things like how to use a cash register for when they get a job at Wal-Mart. Anyone can explain Intelligent Design in one sentence: God (or someone just like him) created everything. It's a very simple explanation that is hard to argue against.

I REMEMBER on CAMRA trips many years ago a song being sung with the refrain “The brewery tap’s a supermarket now.” And in recent years that has proved all too prophetic, with a number of pubs in the local area closed and replaced with the likes of Tesco Express. This may be a cause for regret, but in reality it is a symptom of the decline of the pub trade, not a cause.
Housman also authored one of my favorite quotes:
I’m in the wrong line of work.
While each of us wants the approval of our family, the reality is that sometimes we have to set aside ‘what the family wants’ for what God wants. Those are hard words as it’s sometimes a fine line between following God and rejecting family. Jesus knew the importance of setting aside the desires of his earthly father for the desires of his Heavenly Father.

I can only compare my text in its matchless power to Ithuriel’s spear, with which according to Milton, he touched the toad and straightway Satan appeared in his true colors. If I can apply my text to certain things to-day they will come out in their true light; “At the last,” shall be the rod in my hand with which I shall touch tinsel, and it shall disappear and you will see it is not gold, and I will touch varnish and paint and graining, and you shall understand that they are really what they are, and not what they profess to be.

Take trains for example: These massive amazing machines, designed and built by the Whiteman, cost money to procure, run, and maintain. Trains transport millions of black people back and forth to work everyday, and the fees are comfortably affordable. But -- what does the Kaffir mentality do to these machines when they’re caught out for not paying the travel fees? They BURN them down!
Gilmartin continues: From the beginning, Atlantic Yards has been about much more than building a basketball arena. It has been about jobs and housing and an historic community-benefits agreement that ensures that the project's economic and social benefits help the folks who live here and need it most. Even during booming economic times, Brooklyn as a borough has seen unequal resources and opportunities; it is a place where good jobs and affordable housing could make a genuine difference. Now, as the economy stumbles out of the worst recession in decades, they are more necessary than ever.

BUT IF YOU PUT THIS TO THE TEST, PLEASE BE CAREFUL. VENUS RAPIDLY APPROACHES THE SUN THIS MONTH. So I suggest if you try to see it in daylight, you do so in the early part of the month. It is a crescent on May 1, though at 44″ a smaller one, it is still large enough to be detectable. JUST AVOID LOOKING AT THE NEARBY SUN WITH YOUR NAKED EYE AND/OR BINOCULARS OR A TELESCOPE. For more details on how to safely see Venus in Daylight go here. On May 1, 2012 Venus is still about 36 degrees from the Sun. By May 10, 2012 it’s about 3 degrees away and by the 20th it’s 20 degrees away. That is really getting too close for comfort as far as I’m concerned. In the second half of the month I would only look for Venus after sunset – even when taking the precaution of putting a building between me and the Sun. I value my eyes far too much to play games.
The new computers are first generation Intel iMacs. We almost didn’t get Macintosh computers. The district has a Windows/Dell only policy that the Principal and I had to fight to get what I knew would be best for the students of Room 1. After two summer meetings that included presentations from Adobe and Apple, the district decided to grant my request, and we have new Macs. It’s a logical choice: Macintosh computers are widely used in the multimedia and entertainment industry and Apple now offers a certification program that we’d like to start offering the students of RHS.

But I understand their need for one. What's not to understand? Dogs and kids, perfect together.

The process of design is very similar to the process of writing in many ways. It is mostly about the idea or concept, and then it is planned, then designed, then reworked, then sent out, then reworked, then sent out, then reworked, then approved, then printed, then done, then some people love it, some people hate it and most people feel nothing about it.

Really? We all thought so, but it's good to hear it from you.
There is a chink of light ahead already. There does seem to be a minor shift at the moment, both by smaller traditional publishers and their imprints and some subsidy publishers. It has to do with their ‘publishing models’. If you like, we are seeing publishers move a little both ways. Earlier this year HarperCollins appointed Bob Miller to head up a new imprint, HarperStudio. This eclectic imprint offers authors advances of no more than $100,000, but offsets 'the pain' by offering a much larger royalty. The imprint involves the author in the process of the book from production right through to hands-on marketing. Effectively, we are looking at a kind of partnership publishing. On the other side of the coin, we have subsidy publishers like Cold Tree Press who are now moving away from out and out subsidy publishing toward the traditional model of publishing. Troubador in England are another example. They operate a sister imprint called Matador, (run by Jeremy Thompson, one of the most successful self publishing authors in the last twenty years) who self/subsidy and partnership publish depending on their evaluation of a book. I believe long term success lies somewhere in between self/subsidy and partnership publishing, and several publishers are starting to see this, both in the UK and United States. I would be nice to believe that this change is driven by entrepreneurism and independence, but the reality is economics.
It took me a long time to be comfortable with my never-married single status. Seeing Robin and hearing about her family tugs at my heartstrings just a bit, reminding me of the road not taken in my life. At least.... not taken yet. That chapter's not yet written.... and I'm okay with that.

This administrative outrage, of course, is highly selective. Imagine the following counter-example. A couple of Duke professors pen a research paper noting (correctly) that opposition to marriage equality skews toward under-educated segments of the population. Duke’s Christian student organization, whose members oppose marriage equality but who see an association with poorly educated people as personally offensive to their religious beliefs, pen a letter wailing that “the implications and intentions of this research at the hands of our very own prestigious faculty, seemingly without a genuine concern for proactively furthering the well-being of the Christian community is hurtful and alienating.” The Christian students demand “a dialogue” with the paper’s authors “that addresses our concerns about research’s intent, methodology, analysis and conclusion, in addition to its validity.”
I am feeling good otherwise. I continue to lose weight and the clothes continue to get looser. I am excited about the prospect of going to my brothers cookout at the end of the month down another 5-8 pounds from where I am now. At his cookout last year I was around 300 pounds. So I have every possibility of going to the cookout 70 pounds lighter than I was last year. Many of the people only see me once a year so their reaction should give me a nice charge.

No one should be allowed to participate in, or accompany someone to an MRI, and then be allowed to drive afterward.

I'm used to running around like a crazee lady everywhere--so, when put into a dimly lit, tight space for almost an hour-- I nearly gave myself whiplash from all of the winks I was trying to catch-but not trying to catch--because there was a guy in another room--performing the MRI who could see the whole freak show through a window. Yeah, and this was the day I had "Cousin It" hair, so I'm pretty sure it was a sight to see....

Now, this does not mean that he doesn’t understand the Constitution, it’s pretty straightforward, after all. We used to teach it to 6th graders, and they managed to grasp things like “separation of powers,” “three co-equal branches,” and “checks and balances.” It’s not rocket science. It’s not even political science. Yet somehow BO feels that it is his place not only to undermine our very Constitution but to “call out”–in typical BO Chicago thug style–the Supreme Court of the United States, trying to bully and berate and guilt them into a ruling that is patently contrary to the spirit (and the letter) of the Constitution.

This is as good a place as any to get started. Weasel is short for "bushweasel." What's a bushweasel, you ask? Well how silly of you to not know! Or at least that's the reaction I recieved from my eldest (now a teen) when she was 3. One day, she came home form preschool and announced that she was a bushweasel, then proceeded to explain to her obviously intellectually deficient mother (ever been talked down to by a 3 year old?) what a bushweasel is:
Before Thomas Edison changed the world, though, light was a precious commodity. When night fell, darkness waltzed right indoors as if it owned the place. It reigned everywhere except in the small pools of luminance that radiated around a flame. One way to broaden those pools was to place a candle in front of a reflective surface—a metal wall sconce, perhaps, polished to a shine—that would intensify both the flame and the hazy glow around it.
My father doesn’t talk much about his childhood in Denmark, but I don’t think it was a happy one; a factor that I believe contributed not only to his decision to pull up stakes and immigrate to Canada at 20 years old, but also to his inability to bond all that well with his children as we got older. I do love my dad; he’s not been a bad father or anything like that, and he’s always provided very well for us; but we’re not often very comfortable around each other.

At a basic level, many of these fans now have to face the fact that this particular musical icon of theirs doesn't share their opinions on the conflict. To Waters, perhaps, the seperation barrier, and the Arab-Israeli conflict as a whole, is peripheral to, or just a part of the political problems facing the world. But to the fans living out religious ideals in the Holy Land, these issues are central to their worldview. Thus, any posturing on these topics is taken personally.

For some reason the cold is REALLY bothering me this year. The past few years it sort of bounced off me, but this year I just can't warm up. I'm cold ALL the time, even in bed. Usually I get really hot when I go to sleep, and end up tossing off the covers, but now I burrow under the covers and don't even stick out my arms. I'm just a little tuft of hair peeking out of the duvet. And, with the dark mornings, there is really NO incentive to come out. It's like the whole Earth is telling me to take a nap, all day every day. And I really, REALLY want to. Right now I kind of wish I was a bear and could just hibernate. Hibernate all fat and furry in a cave and come out skinny, hungry and ready to kick some ass in the spring. Sounds kind of good, doesn't it?

As late as June 8, 2006, the FBI page stated: “Usama Bin Laden is wanted in connection with the August 7, 1998, bombings of the United States Embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya. These attacks killed over 200 people. In addition, Bin Laden is a suspect in other terrorist attacks throughout the world.” When asked why there is no mention of 9/11 on the FBI’s web page, Rex Tomb, the FBI’s Chief of Investigative Publicity, is reported to have said, “The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Laden’s Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11.” Additionally Vice President Dick Cheney said, “We’ve never made the case, or argued the case, that somehow Osama Bin Laden was directly involved in 9/11.”[21]

The beam of light from the bathroom door stretches across the cold, sterile floor. Angling its way up a dangling blanket, it widens to a dim ray disruptively crossing the foot of my wife's hospital bed before hitting the wall across the room.

He takes this idea further, though, and says modern models of reality, those based on materialism and the scientific method, are limiting us, blinding us to human potentialities we once had and could have again, were we only open to thinking beyond those models of perception.
This song helped her so much when she was in grief counseling. She was keeping everything bottled up inside, until her counselor played this song for her. She cried like never before, which was difficult to watch, but it was so necessary. Once she got all those feelings out, she was ready to start healing, and I think that was a turning point for her. I also think it was how she discovered music as a form of therapy, which has been an integral part of her growth and healing process ever since.

To the far left the grass never existed. An ankle deep mud pit forms and people squish around in it. White people with brown feet don’t seem to mind as their shoes were taken off long ago. Sometimes you could say it feels good to be back closer to nature. Wearing natural elements as new shoes is certainly getting you in touch with nature.

These Courts are on 421 Loyola Avenue, not Tulane and Broad, so if you head there first, you better call the phone number on the notice, because very helpful folks answered, and connected the delayed party to the Court Clerk, who held their place in Court even though they arrived late.
H.P. L’Orange concentrates on the relationship between art (becoming cruder and cruder), and the development of the great Stalin-esqe world state of Diocletian’s reforms. The decline of the local economy, paired with the rise of the empire-wide economy driven by a state bureaucracy results in quantity, not quality (sounds very Soviet-like) in the realms of civic art, architecture, and even literature. Massive building projects are completed, but with (what we would say) incredibly poor workmanship. Why? Because the economy is now state-based. The sculpture is not done by talented, interested individuals, but by state employees in vast state factories, according to state plans. The empire has changed, and is now concerned with the millions, not the individual. A very bad thing, and the beginning of the Dark Ages per L’Orange. What happens when the state falls and there’s no local production of art/engineering/architecture/literature? It all disappears with the state – and this is exactly what happens in the West.
I am sorry my ancestors brought vaccines and medicines here, along with books, tools, engineering and cars.

The United States had three restaurants in the top 10, with Thomas Keller’s Per Se in New York leading at No. 6 (moving up from the No. 10 spot last year). Alinea, Grant Achatz’ ode to molecular gastronomy in Chicago, fell one spot to No. 7 in this year’s ranking. Daniel Humm’s Eleven Madison Park in New York shot up from No. 24 last year to tenth place this year.

Despite being much less punky than The Jam, the Style Council were still very powerful on stage. Paul Weller’s vocal style hadn’t changed, and that in itself guaranteed a powerful feel. The sheer number of contributing elements – the Hammond tonewheel organ and piano, the brass section, the harmonised backing vocals, etc – would make for a big sound pretty much regardless of the songs, but make no mistake, the songs were brilliant. Catchy, very well arranged, and performed with passion.
My 29th birthday was last week.....well almost a week and a half ago now......bad blogger!
Now it's decision time. I'm early, after that no-hassle run across the state, so I've got time before I meet Penn Sales Mahoff Eric Heinauer for dinner at the brewery. Hit the Church? Tempting. East End? I already know Scott's not there. Maybe Piper's...no, the traffic will kill that. Then I got a text from my man Sam Komlenic, copy editor for Whisky Advocate, essentially telling me that if I were in Pittsburgh and didn't get to Wigle Whiskey, I wasn't a man. Normally, this kind of pronouncement has zero effect on me, but in this case, Sam was right. I aimed the Jetta for The Strip, and started cursing rush hour traffic. Got there in time for a quick lookaround, and Eric Meyer was, luckily, sticking around to meet a guy who wanted to have a bachelor party there. We shook hands, and he gave me a quick tour.
God’s Word tells us clearly what we are to do, where the problem is, is that few recognize that it is one of their many responsibilities that comes with calling themselves a “Christian.”
Happy Easter! Since my husband confidently assures me that Easter lasts for fifty days by the Church’s reckoning, I can get away with saying it a week late. I hope you had a lovely one, and I look forward to catching up with comments and other blogs as soon as I can. We have had a memorable week away, but there is the inevitable mountain of catching up to do on the domestic and paperwork front before I can justify settling down to read.

CONNECTING with your customers by email can be an extremely effective way to create an ongoing relationship and instantly interact with your best supporters. One programme that I’ve used frequently is Mail Chimp (www.mailchimp.com). It’s free to use for those with contacts under 2000 and has great templates to design your emails; in addition to storing your contacts and sending your emails. It will never give you the same professional result as a graphic designer, for the price (FREE) it’s excellent. The analytics that it provides post campaign are better than some of the paid email programmes out there. If you’ve never used email marketing before then I would recommend reading up on the resources section of the site first, in particular this article. Mail Chimp will lock your account if your open figures are less than desirable so that is something to consider before you sign up.

Matthew 6:26-30: “Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?”
After a lot of work, Safa finally succeeded. With the support of the community, and in-kind donations, she and her peers were able to open a small resource center in a beautiful old building just minutes from the sea. “I thought about the name Aros el Bahr because it is the historical name of Jaffa,” Safa explains. “All the time they say that Jaffa is the bride of the Sea. I like that. It’s a very feminine name.”

Pitch: Tessa Rapporin is about to graduate high school with a dire need to become an animator, a crush on Jason Garvy, and a serious case of princess envy. When her crush crushes her heart, Tessa lights out of the graduation dance and runs into the strange new boy in town doing a light show in the park. Only it isn’t a light show: he’s making a magical portal and Tessa gets sucked into a world of princes, Kings, faeries, and wizards, but even in the magical world, Tessa isn’t a princess. She’s a Faerie godmother, and they never get happily ever after.*

Elizabeth Hand is generally hit or miss for me, but on this one it was pretty much all hit. I'll be honest, most of the action revolved around violent death and wrongful sex, but this still managed to be a beautiful story. Artsy fartsy for sure, but splashy enough to pull me through it at a run.
There has been a lot of preparation for this film with origin stories for four of the main characters or five if you include Loki’s introduction as the villain in Thor so now the film has finally been released it is a great relief that the preparation has really paid off in a film that the delivers the best translation of a comic book into a film so far.

At a televised press meet, in response to hecklers in the media Chopra asked how many in the media had read Chetan’s novel. None had; and a visibily irritated Chopra snapped at the gathered mediamen, telling them to ‘shut up’. Chopra’s snap remark stirred a storm in the studio, where empaneled talking heads , summoned by TV channels at short notice, held forth on the film-maker’s temerity to gag the media – how could he, how dare he, ask the media, holy cows of free expression, to shut up.

A rifle squad consists of four Colonial Marines. Each squad may divide into two-man fire teams: the rifle team and gun team. The rifle team consists of a pair of riflemen, each equipped with an M41A Pulse Rifle or a M240 Flame Unit. The gun team is made up of a rifleman with an M41 Pulse Rifle and a machine gunner carrying the automatic M56 Smart Gun. The squad leader may also carry a shotgun. Two or three squads, led by a platoon sergeant (who may be armed with an M41A Pulse Rifle and/or a M240 Flame Unit) riding in a M577 armoured personnel carrier, make up a section. Two sections make up a platoon.

Anyway I had a real urge to play about with the Lily Sugar & Cream cotton again. So I did these flower cloths. It is the Chrysanthemum Dishcloth & it works up quickly. But only once I researched that jolly last round which creates the petals. Stuffed if I could understand that round of the pattern! So I got hunting & as the internet does, there was a youtube clip on how to do it! It was easy but seeing it made more sense than the pattern! Very handy! So these work up very quickly & are great for using up scraps. The yellow/pink/orange was the left over from the cloth the other day. The blue one in front is left over from the Mission Falls yarn the other week. So this pattern is good for left overs. Oh that's why the blue one is smaller too as it is DK yarn instead of worsted weight. So there you go! Some pretty flowers. I am going to give the 2 back ones away to someone soon. I will do another one to go with those 2 as the gift though.

I didn't want to go back there, I was safe behind these walls. Being home I was protected by brick and mortar. The phone rang and I didn't answer it, the answering machine picked up. I tuned out the venomous words that were spoken for me. It didn't matter what they said about me on a machine, it could be easily erased from an answering machine tape with the click of a button. It was going to be a long Christmas Break, it was just the break I needed but never expected.
We now live reasonably close to a Dart station which is of no particular advantage to me, because any time my legs are ouchy, or it's raining, or there's even a vague hint of the possibility of rain, I climb aboard my comedy purple car and drive. But this reasonable closeness also means that any fucker who fancies it can use our quiet street as an unofficial Park and Ride facility. While sometimes irritating, this fact has never caused my anything resembling serious inconvenience. Until this morning when I found myself having to walk what must have been almost 50 metres from house to car. Not good. Not good at all. If I'm going to be a fat lazy cunt, I want to be a fat lazy cunt who doesn't have to do any superfluous strolling. Seething, I parked. Livid, I walked. And what was parked in front of my house only a big fat Beamer. And you know who was sitting in the driver's seat, casually reading a newspaper.

“Now, you little bitch. It’s time for you to do your fucking duty!” Lord Fuckington began to fiddle with his belt. Ever since he had gotten her onto the table the fight had gone out of her. She just lay there watching him without making a sound. Lord Fuckington found this to be very disappointing but he knew of ways and means to make her squirm and fight and beg. As he began to lower his trousers however she thrust out her hand, fingers tight together, palm flat, and jabbed him once in the neck. She moved so fast that he didn’t even see it until she was pulling her arm back.
But in truth, I am often underwhelmed. I see many works that do not move me. But every so often, an artist, an exhibit, or a single artwork knocks me over and reminds me of the true power of art.

Rent Party harnesses a sound and fidelity that is a not unlike his work with Johnny Thunders & The Heartbreakers, but one that is more fleshed out production-wise than LAMF. Listening to Rent Party one can’t help but wonder what the next album by The Heartbreakers would have sounded like if they did not break up in 1977, this is as close as you are going to get. The album features a depth that contrasts its party like atmosphere. Walter Lure proved to be a survivor of the scene he was a part of. Many of his band mate’s have fallen since the release of this album including Jerry Nolan (NY Dolls/Heartbreakers drummer), Johnny Thunders (NY Dolls/Heartbreakers), Waldos original drummer Charlie Sox, Waldos bassist Tony Cairo, and saxophonist Jamey Heath. Walter Lure has continued to play live in New York City with different incarnations of The Waldos since the release of Rent Party, in between his gigs Walter worked on Wall St. as a stock broker (he is now in the financial district). Around 2006/2007, The Waldos started playing more frequently, Walter Lure released a live CD followed in 2007 titled Live In Berlin, which was recorded as a result of a European tour. The album is a solo album and it featured Walter teaming up with Dee Jaywalker. In 2009 and 2011, Lure reunited with original Waldos guitarist Joey Pinter, for some live shows. Currently The Waldos continue to play live (Lure also plays shows as a solo artists) and there has been an interest in a new album, but it is not sure what will materialize. As Lure said in an interview for soundcheckmagazine.net “Whatever happens, happens…. People keep asking me to write more songs and do a new album which I might do if I can write enough new songs to fill it - Who knows?” Rent Party is now somewhat of a rarity, the original pressings go for quite an expensive sum online. In 2009, Rent Party was reissued on vinyl.

There is no excuse to have a random or seemingly unrelated unsymbolical unreflective pointless setting or plot to your short story.

I thought a Butterfly Bouquet would be fabulous!!! I stamped the larger flourish butterfly 5 times, each with a different color of ink, onto natural cardstock and cut each one out. I took a piece of matching colored wire for each one, wrapped it around a skewer, took it off the skewer, and pulled both ends to again lengthen the wire but now it has a wave. I attached the wires to the backs of the butterflies with a little blob of heavy gel medium.

Advice From Dave: Great talk last night, all about the spiritual aspects of the juice feast. Dave is on another spiritual path from me: I am Christian, whereas he talks about the chakras and the kundilindi and the Life Force. But what we have in common is this: we are both acutely aware that we are SPIRITUAL beings, having a HUMAN experience, not just human beings having a spiritual experience. Whatever your spiritual path, a juice feast will help you go deeper. When you clear away the excess, and all the mind-numbing compounds even in the healthiest of foods (think of the content lazy fog we get in after an excellent meal) you are left with the essence of you, your spirit. You can take advantage of this time to release what is no longer serving you. Let go of fears, resentments, old baggage. Change how you think about yourself and the possibilities for your life. Press the reset button on your LIFE, not just your digestion. Like a caterpillar, go into this cocoon of your juice feast, use this time for transformation, and come out a beautiful butterfly, ready to spread her wings and fly to a new possibility.

But recently, in a mode of nostalgia, I dug out my old sheet music and unearthed decades of treasures like Deep Purple, As Time Goes By, Moon River, Born Free, Lara’s Theme, and many more—a couple of which are pictured above. Joe copied the pages individually and taped them together. Now loads of lovely ballads are strung out on the piano. I no longer have to go through the frustration of pausing to turn a page, or continuing to play with one hand while frantically turning pages with the other. Paper clips keep the whole shebang from flying away and piling up on the floor between sessions. When I finish one piece I simply remove it and lay it across the back of the couch which is close behind my piano—and procede to the next number.

That is what real rape looks like. It's not the stranger behind the bushes that we're all told to carry our keys in our hands to prevent. It's not the person who grabs us from behind and stuffs us in the trunk that we take classes to learn to fend off. It's the guy we know. It's the neighbor or the date or the friend or the lover who is known to us. It is not screaming and kicking and scratching. It is fear and however that manifests itself. Maybe it does manifest itself by kicking and screaming. Maybe it manifests itself as submission. After all, that's what we're trained to do from childhood, isn't it? When we're "in trouble", parents invoke fear--(by yelling or what have you) of being spanked or punished in some other way--and the child's job is to be submissive otherwise it will get worse, won't it? Like Pavlov's dogs, we're conditioned through repetition to be submissive when we feel fear, especially women/girls. It's not surprising that most women behave this way. What is amazing are the women who, despite a lifetime of training to behave differently, do physically fight back especially when it's someone they know. To quote the quote:

As they say, people who work hard yet play harder become much more productive, committed, dedicated, and resilient. Some statistics even prove that people who work in a company that’s like their second house or home bring in more results and are much happier and greatly contented.

The only problem to this studying music theory (and learning more about FL Studio) is that I have been getting distracted working on musical composition. Nothing I’ve made so far has made me scream “THATS IT!” In fact I haven’t even whispered those words. The compositions I’ve made aren’t bad (simple but not bad) and I’m keeping many of them for various reasons (I want to make an instrumental beats album for driving) but I’m having a hard time understanding what it is that makes video game music so… perfect for video games.

J is a 13 year old boy much like our R but I just don't feel the connection. Q is an 11 year old girl who has such a beautiful face and a head of natural black hair. In her I see my daughter just like I see my son in R. Both are African American. Both R and Q would complete our family.

During the discussion one of the TAs mentioned the idea of "well, I wouldn't want to be that teacher, but..." which prompted me asking them that about all the teachers. After we had discussed a lot, I asked them to try and make a whole class concept map for instruction. Guided by the question, how can these radically different things we watched all fall under the category 'instruction' In particular, I asked them to think about criteria that we used to evaluate instruction, features that we use to describe instruction, beliefs and questions they have about it. This is what they assembled: (click for full size)
Wow! People can be so creative. After making my rock garden markers, I searched the internet to see what other garden markers people have created. Here is an overview of some of my favorites.
A third major feature of the river system is caused by virtue of the river’s situation in hot, arid areas whereevaporation losses are high. By far the most significant losses are in the Sudd in southern Sudan. Between entry and exit the river loses up to 50 percent of its original flow. This loss to the system for Egypt and Sudan has meant significant shortfalls in summer months, when flows from the Blue Nile reach their lowest point. Therefore, enabling greater White Nile flows during this period has important economic consequences, even though it is only a relatively small proportion of annual flows. Reducing this loss was at the heart of attempts to speed up the flow through the Sudd via the Jonglei Canal Scheme.

So back to the good stuff. We did a LOT of shopping. Gymboree Outlet was having a sale. *Sigh* This is the same Gymboree Outlet that I waited 2 hours to check out in the middle of the night on Black Friday. I got some great deals though! 17 items for $63! Plus I got $25 in Gymbucks. (Side note - When I got home to spend the gymbucks, there was a lady in the store who gave me her $25 in Gymbucks so I ended up with $50! SCORE!)
Another short-lived Starlog imitator was the awkwardly-titled Science Fantasy Film Classics, which had a four-issue run from late 1977 through 1978. The issue at the top of this post, the fourth and final issue, was the only one I ever bought, and unlike some of the other genre film mags of the era (Space Wars, I'm looking at you), it was in color and reasonably well-produced. (If I recall correctly, that Mattel "Code Name: Galactica" toy insert that I posted here a while back, originally appeared in this magazine.)

People often complain about the homogenisation of our towns and cities, which are progressively loosing their individuality, as identikit branches of SpecSavers, Car phone Warehouses and Starbucks blur each town into an indistinguishable uniformity. Yet why do they applaud the invidious campaign to homogenise humanity?

For, Lewis continued, he was not a man at home in the modern world. He once said that his ideal day would consist of getting up and writing letters before breakfasting from 8 to 9. From 9 until 12 he would read and write. Lunch would go from noon till one. From one to four or five he’d go on a long walk. At five he would eat dinner and after dinner he would return to his reading and writing until retiring between nine and ten. In another interview, he said the ideal condition in which to exist was a state of permanent mild convalescence in a hospital bed near a window overlooking the sea with a large stack of books within arm’s reach. “You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me,” he once said.

I knew he was going to be with his family for Thanksgiving. Facebook told me so. (I swear I wasn’t stalking.) They lived in Oregon…which is farther North than I was. Northern Friend suggested that I text him and see if he wanted to stop by on his way home for coffee. I swallowed hard. Uncharted territory…unfamiliar ground. It was Saturday. I was leaving the next day. He would in fact be driving right by my city on his way home. It could be a casual invitation…easy…simple….no pressure.
Yup, I'm gonna do it. It will be my first project using power tools and I'm looking forward to it. I really like this one in the photo. The unfinished wood and the two shelves.. it's perfect.

In the intervening years, the McMenamins have become innovators many times over. They invented the concept of the theater pub when they opened the Mission Theater in 1987--a model that has spread not only throughout the city, but across the country. In 1990, they opened Edgefield, the first of their destination hotels; a 1911 poor house, it was converted into a European-style hotel, fully restored in the emerging McMenamin style--lots of funky artwork painted directly on the walls, antique fittings, and strange light fixtures. A cross between Dr. Seuss and Alice in Wonderland.

2. The teams to compete in the Rose Bowl are traditionally the conference champions from the Pac 10 and the Big 10. Well, this year the Pac 10 conference champion was Oregon, who was already scheduled to play in the National Championship against Auburn. In the Big 10, there was a 3-way-tie for Conference Champion between Michigan State, Ohio State, and Wisconsin. Since Wisconsin was ranked the highest of the three, they automatically received a bid to play in the Rose Bowl. The question was... who will Wisconsin play? The wonderful people from the Rose Bowl turned to the rankings and decided to go with TCU since we were ranked #3, just under Oregon and Auburn, and just above #4 Wisconsin and #5 Stanford.

As a given, you’re going to need an advanced backline to make sure there’s as little space between the ranks as possible and ensure that players won’t have to cover too many yards closing the other team down. As we’ve seen with Chelsea this season, it’s a high wire act over a snake pit.

Paul and I went to and watched the latest Mission Impossible movie yesterday afternoon and then basically blobbed out in front of the TV all evening, but it was relaxing and way better than getting stuck in Spaghetti Land at midnight on the first day of the year. Tonight there was a New Year’s Day party for the Youth Group at church. You never really know who’s going to turn up to youth group these days–it seems like usually the kids who say they will come, don’t, and those who say they can’t, show up. Although that’s not true across the board either. It’s just basically a toss-up. Tonight we had three guys who are in a band show up who haven’t been to youth group in over a year, and it was great to see them; unfortunately, they came to play a set, too, and they had an audience of six, three of whom were adults.
No one likes rejection, especially when it comes to chicks. Some guys have the ability to write it off with a simple "bitch was probably a lesbo" comment to his buddies after he makes the shame-ridden walk back to his table. Others loath rejection to such a point that they do everything in their power to avoid it. Jessica Alba could be sprawled out naked on their bed, using empty beer bottles to pregame her pussy and they would still be apprehensive about making a move. I put myself somewhere in the middle. I hate being rejected, but at the same time know how to read a girl to an educated degree.

President Obama is probably one of the most discomforted by this whole business. The things he said during a press conference on March 23 were not the words of a disinterested politician. One phrase stood out to me, and pretty much everyone else: “You know, if I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon.”
Or if you're one of those well-adjusted types - I hear rumors of that strange breed walking amongst us, those with not a hint of chip on their shoulder or darkness in their heart - maybe you could impart some wisdom upon those of us who would like a glimpse into the mind of someone who doesn't go through the day with a grudge, a whimper or a sigh.

Way, way back in 1976, a few people in Bogotá thought it would be great to close off some streets to car traffic for a few hours so people could use the street for running, walking, cycling, etc. On that first Sunday, they closed off two blocks. Fast-forward 36 years, and Bogotá now closes off 75 miles of city streets every Sunday, attracting over one million people to come out and play. Every week.

This may seem a bit extreme, but every person’s energy affects every other person’s energy. What if you suddenly weren’t here? Your absence would create a hole in the energy field which would be felt by people who don’t even know you. Recall, in the paragraph above how your actions set off a chain reaction affecting a waitress you never even met. We all have worth and value beyond what we can see or feel. So when you start to have doubts about your worth, have faith. Faith is not belief without prove, its trust without reservation.

I’ve heard or read that 80 percent of the things we worry about don’t ever happen. Frankly, I don’t know how researchers could arrive at such a statistic or how they’d measure it. But if I take their word for it, that would mean four out of every five things I worry about would never happen.
However, this emergence of symptoms has really caused me to question what in the world is going on. Why now? What triggered it? And why did it seem so unmangeable? While I was doing some serious soul-searching I was reminded of what Jen, my therapist at Laureate, said. She constantly reminded me that when I was in a state of fear I was most vunerable to behaviors.

While this might be true, my experience is that the best of the best come from the reliable top-quality brewers in the state. In my book, Double Mountain lead the pack: this years killer green was amazing, a real hop bomb that was perfectly balanced (in the NW usage of balance) and yet the fresh hop characeter shone through but not in an aggressive way. I think it is the most accomplished fresh hop beer I have ever had (picture below from the Skamania Celebration of Beers event).

Joining the real estate industry in Singapore can prove to be challenging given the nature of the industry.

Everyone in my group – somewhat reluctantly – then made our way to our third room, where we found “Mrs. Fig”: a little old lady who sat in bed, talked about cats (specifically Smokey, the distillery cat), and collected keys on red ribbons, which had at some point been given to members of our group in previous rooms. I don’t recall exactly what the keys were all about, but the character of Mrs. Fig and Smokey the Cat definitely added to the surreal, Dickensian feel of the evening.

The most puzzling poster is the one of Sarkozy kissing Frau Merkel. The couple were bosom allies the last time I checked, so why show them kissing? Could Sarko have bribed the fashion house to do it because he wanted to make his wife jealous? A new mother is often so infatuated with her baby that she neglects her husband’s needs. Maybe the poster will prompt Carla to accelerate her programme of coochie exercises so she can wrap her luscious thighs around Sarko the next time he ventures into the marital bed. If he keeps on fantasizing about getting into Frau Merkel's pants it might damage the French national interest. She doesn’t look like the sort of woman who’ll give it away for nothing.
It’s to Zemeckis’ credit that A CHRISTMAS CAROL is the best performance capture I’ve seen; it looks good enough that I actually didn’t mind watching most of it. I’m not sure why most of the actors play multiple roles (Carrey is not only Scrooge, but all of the Ghosts of Christmas; Oldman is Bob Cratchit, Jacob Marley, and Tiny Tim) except maybe to save some cash for the studio, but it can be a bit disconcerting to see vaguely familiar faces popping up on multiple bodies.

The prospect of death as a consequence of disobedience to state law did not stop Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego refusing to bow down to the image (Dan 4:6-8), or Daniel persisting with public prayer (Dan 6:1-10). They were defiant and their obedience was rewarded when God intervened miraculously on both occasions to save them.

The dead and the living, dawn or dusk, on the domes and spires of all the west is ineffably beautiful.

“We’re having a picnic if it kills us!” That was our mindset as we loaded up the new hibachi grill his parents had given him. Sort of a mini-charcoal wonder in a lovely burnt orange, it fit easily into the trunk of the ’67 Camaro. A big pack of pork chops, homemade potato salad, a Tupperware container of cookies and we were ready for fun. David fired up the grill while I spread our fare on the table by Dania Beach. We heard a little rumble. C’mon charcoal, get hot! In order to hurry things along I dipped potato salad onto paper plates. Thankfully I’m frugal! Look at all the money we saved by buying the worthless mega-pack.

The traditional big comprehensive school is a Frankensteinian creation: there’s no sense of community, and it’s somehow less than the sum of its parts. Unnatural clusters form, some in the shape of the bullied underdog surrounded by his or her tormentors, others in the shape of cliques and hierarchies. Academically, those who are gifted but lacking in individual motivation are given a raw deal; furthermore, those most needing attention and those who are best at grabbing attention monopolise on resources. Too much time is spent bringing a semblance of order to the classroom, but outside in the playground the kind of orders that manifest themselves are rarely desirable. For academic reasons, it looks like setting and streaming might be the answer, while for social reasons, the argument for a small-school environment is compelling.

We get to the hairdressers, and although she winces every time she cuts the curls off, off they come. And then the sides of his head are shaved. He’s thrilled – huge smile all over his face. There are curls all over the floor. She spikes up the centre part of his hair and he can’t stop grinning. He’s a happy boy.
I have chronically the similarities between parent and child, and God and man, but the similarities are alarming at times. He loves us even though we screw up. He loves without ceasing, and showers us with gifts. Being the father figure to the whole world, he just has to do this a whole bunch more than we do as fathers of our own children. This is not to be taken lightly, however. To be a full-fledged instrument of the Lord, means to love Him above all else, as He loves us above all else. We must crave a loving relationship with the creator that loved us so much that He sent His only son to the cross in our stead. To truly love someone, you have to be able to do a few basic things: 1) Love them all the time, and not just when it suits you. 2) Forgive them when they wrong you, as Jesus forgave even His persecutors. 3) Repeat the above 2 steps always and unconditionally. You see, to love someone fully you must be able to live with their faults. You must be able to see past their exterior and know their heart. God can do all these things. He constructed me and my heart, and He knows the inner plan that my heart has going on at the present, and past. We are constantly told through scripture to love those around us, but how many of us really live this out? I know for a fact that I don’t. i hold wrath most of the time when wronged, when I could as easily just forgive and pray about the solution that I would have likely made instead. God calls us to a higher standard than anyone else as followers in His name. He can give His all to love us, why can we not give our all to love Him back? It is a fundamental disconnect with our maker that if we ever figure out will bless us richer than we could ever know.
The Woodlands, Texas, is not misnamed at all. It's a largely invisible city,you can drive from end to end of it pretty much unaware of any buildings. Everything is screened and blanketed by trees. Running, cycling and walking paths criss-cross it, residential neighbourhoods are small enclaves, yet not physically far from village malls. Yes, I know, village/mall= oxymoron to we brits, but over there, in a city that started a few heartbeats ago, it's not so strange.

As much as I hate the average lyrca cyclist, some of which have deliberately sat in the middle of the road to stop me getting round, at least they have a pre-determined reason for being a cunt, even if I don't agree with it.

But the Board noted that there is "little judicial precedent or guidance" as to the impact of Internet websites on trademark infringement suits or concurrent use proceedings. It declined to create an absolute rule barring geographically restricted registration when one or more of the parties does business via the Internet.

If these cherished ideals were forceful enough to grant her a place among his queens or Gopīs is unknown to me. But in her current shape as Kuntī it remains a heartfelt ideal, the deepest motive and most treasured emotion. We should realize that all self-realized souls cherish the intimate romantic love of Kṛṣṇa and his queens, Kṛṣṇa and the Gopīs, and Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa above all else – regardless of the capacity or level of intimacy to which their personal nature permits them to access Kṛṣṇa.
That man who is possessed of true purity of conduct and who is always devoted to the preservation of a proper attitude towards all, indeed, he who is possessed of (pure) attributes and merit, is regarded as truly pure.

I also learned that (as I said on my facebook page) I don't give my husband near enough credit.
The problem with arguing with someone with a big investment in their beliefs, and it is as true of atheists as followers of any religion, is their rejection of reason. In my current argument, with a Catholic, I have been compelled to cite papal bulls to illustrate my points. Fortunately in this debate my opponent is a lot less abusive than some I have encountered.

Timeless. Two dark rows of thick eyelashes catch my eye. Then that sweet swoop of a nose that I saw in my first ultrasound picture – it has grown a little, but it looks just like it did the first time I saw him. His mouth is slightly open, revealing a row of straight teeth that match him just right. Hair that is so many colors – brown, red, blonde – crowns his head, laying straight and tidy except where it is not.

The host staff can often be downright rude, acting as though they are doing you a tremendous favor by merely allowing you to eat there. For example, despite a posted sign indicating that the restaurant will open at 11:00 a.m. for lunch, the host staff will often open the door whenever they please – the long line of guests outside be damned. And the wait staff, though not affirmatively impolite, are frequently indifferent and inattentive.

The challenge comes as part of a motion to quash filed yesterday against the Justice and Treasury Departments at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by Riyadh-based Al Rajhi Bank. It asks Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle to quash an administrative subpoena issued by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Oregon, which is prosecuting a man accused of conspiring to smuggle $151,000 in travelers and cashier’s checks out of the United States. The checks were allegedly cashed at an Al Rajhi branch in Saudi Arabia.

There is always something interesting to be found in my car (I am not all that great about keeping my car clean…oops). I have found CDs I thought long lost, a single shoe, several mismatched socks, sweaters, and even a pair of pants (why am I disrobing in my car?). There is constantly dog hair and empty coffee cups. Old mail too but that usually gets removed after a day or two because I remember I need something out of the mail I tossed in the back seat. I currently have a pillow (this is starting to sound like I am homeless) and painting supplies in the back. Nothing in there surprises me anymore and it is always mine.

The word vulgar comes from Latin vulgus, meaning the ‘common people’ or the ‘crowd’. The Latin vulgaris, consequently, means ‘of or pertaining to the common people’. The Proto-Indo-European prefix *wel- refers to ‘crowd’, the Sanskrit vargah means ‘division’ or ‘group’ and some Celtic languages such as Middle Breton and Welsh use words like gwal’ch (‘abundance’) and gwala (‘sufficiency’) that apparently resemble vulgar etymologically, although there is little similarity left.

Then, when the GFC hit, and many of my friends were retrenched and lost their jobs, while I was purchasing my second property... it hit home that I was really fortunate to have been set up here. My mates in the UK had their savings demolished. The US... not that bad, my friends seem to be doing really well. But I really, really love the way things ended up, particularly how I'm here in Melbourne. I do think I've missed out in the peer learning because I didn't attend these fancy universities, but looking at the last decade... this really was a great place to have spent my twenties. Heck, it was bloody brilliant.

MSM and entertainment rag coverage of Baldwin’s Twitter meltdown and mob followers has downplayed and whitewashed just how crazy their “new tone” is. As Kurt Schlichter pointed out, Baldwin used the Troy Davis story to trash American military leaders and troops and outrageously taunted MacPhail’s family to call for the death penalty against the Bush administration. Baldwin jeered: “Wonder if the McPhail (sic) family will seek death penalty for US leaders who killed thousands of US soldiers and countless innocent Iraqis.””

Julia Donaldson is going to guest blog on this site next month, but I'm proud to say that two of us regular Picture Book Den bloggers also appear along with Julia in that top 400 list. Malachy Doyle and I both make it to positions in the three hundreds, rather pleasingly above such names as Philip Pullman, Jane Austen, Rev Awdry, Jamie Oliver and Katy Price (now there's an interesting party to be had!). High five, Malachy!

Our ward is pretty diverse and so we got the pleasure of being filmed yesterday. I'm not sure if this (diversity) is the reason our ward was picked, I'm just assuming. It could be that the stake public affairs director lives in our ward?!? :)
I had really high hopes of pulling together a decent post to document my little sister's wedding. A few weeks after the wedding came and went. No post. And now it's been about six weeks and...still no post. My older sister is a much more responsible blogger than I -- her pictures are much better, too. See her posts here and here.
The archbishop began his Easter article with a mention of Christ and the obligatory mention of migrants and asylum seekers, but his real purpose was to call for a new social contract "about a sense of mutual obligation". Mutual obligation has been a buzzword in politics for some time and usually means that just as the state looks after those down on their luck, those receiving assistance should put back into society.
So while recognising that we have an obligation to obey the governing authorities God has instituted, our obedience to God himself takes precedence if there is a conflict.

That SEASON FINALE is just epic. And those who’ve watched it can’t imagine it any better – heartfelt and deeply moving in many ways than one. It’s a pretty happy ending and everyone is where they are worthy to be. A few would have been happier to see Peyton Sawyer though, and maybe some of the other characters from back then. On a brighter note, it’s good to see a glimpse of Lucas (despite his haircut) before the entire thing ended, and I think it’s nice Dan received redemption after such long desperate attempts. I swear I felt so sorry for him for a couple of times already and I can’t count how many times I wished they all just get it over with and forgive him. But it seems, they saved it for a really awesome ending. It’s definitely one of the tear-jerker scenes, that one.

The first thing I’d like to say is that Cujo is probably pretty high up on the list of books people know about or think about when you mention the name Stephen King (the others I’m sure are high on the list would be Carrie and The Shining). It’s another one of those stories that people know even if they haven’t read it. Or at least, they know part of it, but I’ll get into that in a bit.
Foreclosed homes are often sold “as-is” and may be in various stages of disrepair. Fixing a foreclosed home to make it habitable could wipe out the money saved on its price tag. Your best real estate “deal”, therefore, may be a non-distressed home in sound, move-in ready condition.

That it may go well with you, and that you may live long on the land. God has given children a responsibility for carrying out part of Christ’s plan to bring unity between generations.

Back in China, I cut a major figure with my posh penthouse, Mercedes sedan, chauffeur, and money that I could spend as I chose. That ability to spend and transfer money was tied to my special red-and-gold foreign experts license, a document rarely accorded someone who wasn’t Chinese. Not only does that gold-embossed “passport” allow one to move money about without restrictions; it also protects the bearer from any kind of harassment at airports and the like. That document was always tucked into one of the pockets in my signature Tilley vest; that is still true here in Canada. I never leave home without it. One might be curious how I managed to get such a document. Think back to 2000, and that special student in my class at Shaw College in Canada. That special student is the one who invited me to come to China the first time, and who introduced me to the inner circles of connected, powerful people, including her uncle, Hu Jintao. No more needs to be said. (p.37)
Last night Kris and I settled down in front of the TV for an episode of our favorite comedy show, How I Met Your Mother. I'm a huge lover of Neil Patrick Harris and Jason Segel so I was always going to be a big fan, I may have forced it on Kris but hey, he makes me watch all sorts of rubbish so we'll call it even! During last nights episode the gang go in search of a burger joint which Marshall claims makes the best burgers in New York City. After thirty minutes of witnessing five people rush around New York eating dozens of burgers we were left for an intense craving for the meaty treat. At that point we made a decision to go on a little lunch date, a search for Newcastles best burger, if you will.

Perhaps it interests me to find lost internet pages. Perhaps it is like throwing rice in front of an East-European vampire: the vampire must stop and count all the grains, you know. It could be that if I am surfing along quietly to myself, and am brought up short by a 'connection reset while the server was trying to load,' or an 'about: blank' where google's cached page was supposed to be, or a straight up blank page where the internet archive promised me the original page -- well it could be that I feel a certain desire, an inordinate (to some) stubborn desire, to retrieve that page.

I know there is prejudice, because when my daughter was ten (before I started writing for children) I was less than impressed (why? I'm not sure) to see her reading books which looked 'girly' - until I discovered the excellent books by Cathy Cassidy, Karen McCombie and Hilary McKay hiding behind those covers. Recently, a friend of mine complained that her 10-year-old daughter was reading 'terrible' books - she was talking about Cathy Cassidy. Needless to say she had never read any of her books, and I was able to put her right.

The film is based on true events about two cops who are trying to change the course of history in Texas City. A slew of murders have taken place in this small town. Bodies have been dumped in the ever eerie marshland, which has been deemed “The Killing Fields”. It’s quite a high stakes journey with a little bit of everything. It’s certainly a dark thriller, but the action qualities of the film balance it out nicely.

I knew nothing about it but I love my own dear thoroughbred, so I signed up for the evening clinic/symposium/workshop on retraining thoroughbreds. I had no idea that the cast of speakers would be such an elite and knowledgable group, but with Bruce Davidson there, anything else was icing on the cake — and there was a lot of icing! The other experts are notable in the thoroughbred and eventing world and with good reason — experience, experience, experience. Their names are at the end of this article.

I'll be leading a trio featuring Gary Versace on organ and Tyshawn Sorey on drums. Gary and I have been playing together in drummer John Hollenbeck's "Future Quest" band performing the music of Meredith Monk. Meredith Monk is a musical icon who has inspired me deeply over the years. I'll have to make a post on her soon. Suffice it to say that Future Quest's participation in her Whitney Museum retrospective last year was a peak musical experience for me. Another peak musical experience of late involved another new project I put together last November that involved Tyshawn Sorey along with guitarist Mary Halvorson and bassist John Hébert at the Cornelia Street Cafe. We did two completely improvised sets of music that I really wish had recorded.

The pantry-our should I say pantries (we have 3). All serve a different purpose. First up, what I like to call the "staples pantry". This is where we store canned goods, dry goods such as rice and noodles, sauces, extra items (such as ketchup, mustard, steak sauce), cooking spices/rubs, and of course, Kylee has her place at the bottom for her food and other essentials. I try to keep this pantry well stocked with items that I can create easy meals with, even in a pinch. I hate preparing dinner only to find I am missing something and have to run to the store!

During her explosive rant she refers to Miss Mills as a pathological liar, a witch, a bitch and a gold-digger who married the former Beatle for his money.’
All we have to put in there is a sofa. A completely destroyed off white slipcovered sofa. Why oh why did I not listen to Big R when he said, "Why are you getting a white sofa? We have two boys.

Colorado summers may very well be the best reason to live in this state. Winter skiing is certainly an attractive counterargument, but the mountain resorts from November through March also attract thick crowds from around the world, most of which presumably drive just 35 mph on I-70 and hold up traffic.

References to Frankenstein these days generally have more to do with the adaptations than the original novel. It seemed like this sketch was actually going in the direction of familiarity with the novel, but it ended up being a conflation of the novel and the adaptations. Of course, we all know that “fire bad” comes from Phil Hartman’s portrayal of Frankenstein. Fred’s vocal tics were obviously perfect, and I loved how none of the guests were freaked out by such a grotesque landlord. B

Anyways, despite the cold and grey of NE, NZ has given me a fresh optimism for Uni, life and everything in between.

The morning seemed to spring to life with our female Rhino and her calf being found plus Umfana, Ntombi's youngster. Having had a good sighting of what we were after and with both Rhino and Leopard being on our way back North we decide to finish off in style. Our Rhino sighting was not a great opportunity for photography but it was an incredible sighting as the youngster came right up beside the vehicle. Maybe with the shelter of the scrub around gave her that little bit more confidence and she ventured right alongside us. Once

As with every other topic I’ve covered so far (and will cover), researching what you want out of a vehicle and what everyone else is paying will help you out tremendously. If you already know what car you want, do a search online and look at some forums to see what other people paid for it. Keep in mind, however, that prices will increase/decrease depending on the location, but you’ll at least get a general idea of your min/max prices. Also take a look at what other consumers think of the car. Read about some of the positives and negatives about each car. If you buy a car that’s fairly cheap because you want to save money, but might need to be taken in for repairs because of on-going issues, you’re just going to end up spending more. Don’t go to the dealership until you get these questions answered.

We watched Faith Like Potatoes last night. We’d had that DVD for a loooong time (I’m surprised I didn’t get an email reminding me to return it when we were done viewing it … but I guess that as long as they’re getting their monthly fee from us, they’re ok – ha!). It was a good movie, although it got off to a rather slow start. It’s based on a true story, which always appeals to me. I need to go check my queue to see what’s up next … I wonder how long we’ll have it before we get a chance to watch it – with Cardinals games almost every night and with the Blues still playing, we don’t have a lot of free evenings to watch movies.
I can envision the feminine energy of V being disclosed sometime soon the English as a sign and those that are on a etheric spiritual journey will heed this and embrace it…and who knows with its help come through the turmoil that must happen..to a carer safer place.

4) Starting from the bottom of your flower (what you call the bottom of your paper), tape the end of the ribbon so it does pull through while you lace or sew it in your flower. Lace from each "petal" towards the middle, so not skip any sections, but do not go from petal to petal, even in the back (you can see it from the front). Have fun with your ribbon, if it is two sided like mine, flip it around for fun to see the different colors. As you are sewing, do not pull to tight on the ribbon, it gives it a stretched look. Also be careful when sewing through the holes, it is paper and it can break. An option here is to use eyelets in the holes to give them more strength. I did break one of my holes when making one, and I just used clear tape to patch it up.

What do you think? Would an exquisitely written memoir about a so-called boring life be something you would read? Could you get into a serious version of a "Seinfeld Show" type of story?

But other plans are also being laid. Whether one does or doesn’t accept the gold manipulation thesis, there is some prima facie evidence in the EU of secret restrictions on retail access to the stuff. This makes sense, and is an attempt to stop a hypothetical run on all banks in favour of buying the shiny metal. I think it overestimates the focus and IQ of the average citizen, but you can see why some unelected dweeb has suggested they do it.

The interesting thing on this project for me, was how hard it was to make this a Halloween card. The owl is really stately, so pairing it with kitchy, silly stuff was not going to work. So, I went really dark and mysterious with it instead. I could make it a Halloween card, I suppose, but instead I am using it as a birthday card for one of my best male friends who has a Fall birthday. I think this is a nice, masculine card.

Strands of Jack’s dark hair peaked through the space between his fingers. He let his shiny, soft hair through the cracks at the length he wanted it trimmed. I stood behind him, making eye contact in the mirror. I held the buzzing electric clippers at my side. “Don’t worry, it’ll be fine. Just buzz the hair that’s between my fingers,” Jack reassured me. “But I like your hair long. I like running my fingers through it,” I pleaded. Jack smiled. “It’ll grow back soon. I promise. My hair grows pretty fast. And don’t worry about cutting my hands. You won’t. And even if you do, I’m sort of a masochist anyway.”

Here we get the sex appeal of the film. With a nearly all-male main cast, Scarlett Johansson is the lone female, but boy does she make quite the impression. While she is very nice to look at, Whedon (known for using kick-butt females, i.e. Buffy the Vampire Slayer) is certain to solidify her place among these superheroes by showing just how much butt she can kick. Miss Johansson proves that she is more than just sex appeal as she takes out multiple men all while being tied up. To top it all of we also get a little humor thrown in there with the phone call.

It’s a service that is LONG overdue.

2. Fat does not necessarily equal unhealthy. Just because someone is overweight does not necessarily mean that they live off junk food and live a sedentary lifestyle, either. I’ve ranted about this before, but it comes up so often that it bears repeating. There are a number of studies that show that diabetes, high cholesterol, and other such risk factors can lead to premature death–but those health problems show up in people of all sizes and weights. Being fat, in and of itself, has not been conclusively linked to premature death–but dieting has. Oh, and there are dozens of studies showing that most dieters regain the weight they lost.
Genius may be a thing of awe, but the better part of brilliance is common sense.
To make the flowers for the corner bouquets, I fussy cut (a gazillion) flowers from the Sweet Tooth collection and layered them with foam squares. To make the spiral tendrils, I wrapped narrow strips of paper around a wooden dowel, securing the ends with tape, and lightly spritzed them with water. After the paper strips were dry, I unwound the spirals and gently stretched them out.
The watering can cut is also from Freshly Picked. I must have been in a one-cartridge state of mind! :) I cut the watering can with 'metal sheets' by QuiKuts. I adore that stuff! (Even though the cashier at Hobby Lobby ruined the first three sheets of it for me!! Arg!!) It feels like a thin pop can..... if... a pop can had adhesive on one side! Haha. But it is so fun to use with Cricut cuts!! I didn't worry about being careful with the metal sheet because I wanted it to look like the watering can was old, and had been used...a lot! So that is why it looks kind of dented all over. That is actually the look I was going for! Then, the flowers are sticker fabric flowers from a dollar pack that JoAnn had a long time ago. And, the card base is one from those DCWV box of cards (& envelopes.) This one is from the box called "The Linen Closet." And that is it. Super simple. But it did let me craft for a bit, so I'm happy!

What role did race play in the response by so many people who were saying that black people were rushing to judgment? What role did race play in America’s history of racial intolerance?

I used to devour books, being very gluttonous in nature when it comes to obtaining knowledge, satisfying curiosity. I read too much but without acknowledgement that some books had less worth than others. For me they all contained insights, and although my preferred genres were fantasy and later an detective mysteries. It is not all the adventures, the fantastical elements, and the wit of adrenal that appealed to me. I liked reading about people. About peoples reactions, emotions to overwhelming, life changing events. And I still do.

Labour was re-elected in 1999 for 3 terms but did damn all to reverse its sell-out to monetarism of the '80s. It reformed the Employment Contracts Act to restore the 'balance of power' between employers and unions but the unions remained hollow shells and never recovered their mass membership. Labour had to live with the neo-liberal parameters it imposed in the 1980s. Its ‘rescued’ some privatised state assets like AirNZ and NZRail but for the sake of business not workers. State provision of basic infrastructure has always been the role of the state in NZ as a subsidy to a weak national capital. So basically Labour accepted the neo-liberal ‘settlement’ of the 1980s and imposed further limits on the sovereignty of parliament through fiscal and monetary policy constraints.

For now they have a Limousin bull over there and he looks like he could be a good cross for Betsy when she is ready. That's going to be a while off for now though. Maybe by then we will have a few more bovines around here to keep her company. Otherwise she is happy talking to their cows through the fence.

That’s what the film focusses on. I mean there’s obviously this crime going on, but that’s just there to shape the story and not to provide it, because Mr. Linklater focusses not on the macabre murder that happened, but instead on the love this whole entire town had for this man and how they just wouldn’t accept facts because of it. And I loved that approach, I really did, I loved it because this film really gets you into that small Texas town in the nineties, and you feel like you’re actually there eavesdropping on the neighborhood conversations, mostly because Mr. Linklater uses fake “documentary” style interviews with people who knew Bernie and Nugent to quench our curiosity for this strange situation.

Another coming to writing. My Maggie. My Maggie is me. My Maggie is me but she is also other Maggies. My other twin who killed herself two years after my mother died. Who signed her suicide note with a smiley face. Two experiences of death, of the dying of these other selves and how they were banished by the Catholic Church and muttering, muttering, muttering of words that are meant to protect but only put a wall up against any further inquiry or meditations. I wrote to get past this wall. I wanted to know WHY. WHY WHY WHY the words littered on a page. Why when we talk of death or dying we look up, like we're hoping to find the belly of a traveling hotel? I wrote my novel Green Girl as a way to ward off death. I wrote Book of Mutter as a way to resurrect. I wrote O Fallen Angel as a reminder of how people choose to forget the death and ugliness and cloak it in silence. And a question haunting me today, which is actually taken from an profile on the actress Anne Heche in the NYT Sunday magazine: How do people survive their lives? I am walking around feeling vile, violated. Not only because of the sickening of grief. I had felt clear about my grief, sad but clear and sure. Death that makes one realize one is still living. Death that makes one wake up and look at one's life. But then there's always something. There's always more tragedy. How can one bear it if one cannot write it? I do not know. Perhaps that is an impossible question. Although I know: If I did not have words I would be dead. And when I don't have words I am dead.
So I began organizing and decided that since I was organizing I might as well move the washer and dryer out to the curb since we will be getting new- working ones soon. After moving them off the back porch I realized how entirely dirty the carpeting was and since I have never liked carpeting- and never really understood why the previous owners would carpet outside I tore up the carpeting and spikes.
The student needs to understand that memorizing is not learning. Neither, for that matter, is abstract intellectualizing. Giving a quiz to make sure that everybody has at least read the assignment works on the reductive, essential level. The only way for a teacher to find out if students are learning is to ask them to apply principles or themes or ideas from a wide range of perspectives to creatively devised hypothetical situations, challenges and prompts.

As the sun would slip down behind the ridge of the mountains, we would slow our play and sit around talking and sharing our childish dreams with one another. Slowly, the air would cool and the sun would disappear into its nightly bed.

Dear Mr. Somesuch,
If the writers wanted me to feel for Tommy or understand him, instead of using others point of views, Tommy's POV would have been better. In three episodes I still do not know much about Tommy, at least nothing positive. I can't feel sorry or feel pity for a one dimensional character.
“Truly?” he asked in surprise.
Well that's an awful lot of changes for one person and I won't pretend it will be easy or that I will get all of it done but if I make an effort, that will be a start.

Phoebe drying off after a dip in my bath water (don't ask!):
My husband has today off, the first of his three day holiday weekend. The first thing he does is make plans to be out of the house with people other than me. Sure, I could tag a long, but he knows it can make me anxious to just tag along when I didn’t have a heads up so I could prepare mentally. I know that asking for time to prepare sounds like a lot to ask, but really it isn’t. I do not need hours of contemplation to prepare. Just an hour or so while I do my hair and make-up, as I only do my hair and make up when going to do something outside of the house.
Consider it one of nature’s cruel jokes, that death and despair can rise out of your hope.

See, there are slits in the corners of the tatting shuttles. Here is tatting Shuttle 1. It is wrapped with Lizbeth Thread Size 20. The color is Azalea Med. You can see both sides of the shuttle here and how one side is made to look like an Easter Egg and one side to look like an Easter Basket!
There is not much glory or reward as society would typically define it for a little league coach. No riches to speak of, except for maybe a gift card to The Cheesecake Factory at the end of the season. And the most recognition they get is the moment at the end-of-the-season party in which the coaches are inevitably pushed into the pool.

Lemme first of all start with an apology for not blogging often lately. Its been a busy and hard time where I work and I am yet to get the right rhythm.
it's not particularly new, but I'm a cook book junkie and have an urge to acquire as many as possible. and this one has been patiently awaiting its turn on the shelf :) although you might call it a cook book, there's so much more to it... in a nutshell, it's a tale of two englishmen leaving their busy lives in the city to open a guest-house in a tiny french village.
“How have you been, Rammy?”
So why do radical Islamist hate America? Why is it perceived by a large population of this country that their threat is real, their goals are real, and the United States puts itself in grave danger by not doing everything they can to combat the threat? I do admit that there is a threat and their goals are real but are we as a nation really in grave danger? I’m not convinced.

New York City is remarkably diverse, but on close examination, a walk through the many neighborhoods of this city will reveal segregation based on ethnicity and social class/income. Remove students and visitors from the equation and you will find some areas quite homogeneous as far as actual residents.

Still, forgiving our parents their limitations, it is important for their self esteem that they know how things work. Plus, they can, in turn, teach their peers who were never taught to sew by their children. Don't you agree?
Except you know what?
I've been the one who's gone through the last two years with this child, coaching and begging and cajoling and pleading and yelling at him to get assignments in and study hard. Sidekick just hasn't been there and mostly through choice rather than the circumstance of us being separated and eventually divorced. Apart from a 6 month stint where he left the town we had moved to and so was 3 hours away, we've lived only a few minutes away from each other. And he works shift, which means he has 4 - 5 days off at a time. I know many men seem to have different priorities when they separate - "I must find someone else and re partner so I'm not alone" kind of thing but I must admit that any shred of respect I had for him fled once I saw the way he completely dropped his kids off his priority list in favour of a new girlfriend.
They were stamped using Bashful Blue and then rock n rolled with Marina Mist. The papers as you can see are from the Everyday Enchantment collection....and you only have until tomorrow to place a qualify order of £45 or more to earn these or the stampsets from this years Sale-a-Bration Collection.

In contrast, the depiction of London in Jennifer E Smith's The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight kept on jolting me, because I knew more than the author. I kept on wanting to tell her things. For example, British weddings tend not to feature loads of adult bridesmaids all dressed the same, and they don't go down the aisle before the bride. Clinking a glass at a British wedding means a speech, not a kiss. Middle-class families with lots of children don't tend to live in Paddington - just three examples, but I could go on and on. 'Everything in this city seems old, but charmingly so, like something out of a movie.' is not a meaningful description to a Londoner.

I often just open my arms and say, "Yes, I'm still here." That seems to break the ice and put others at their ease.
With tears in his eyes, he was twelve at the time, he had done just that, and her being too young to understand what was going on just went on by her brothers side, no sandals, just feet in the earth. They walked for a while before night time came and her brother finally tried to explain to her young mind that they would never see their parents again. This did not sit well with this Irish lass, she started wailing for her parents and wanted to go back home, but her brother would not let her. She fought him, young fists pounding on his almost adolescent chest, made to grow up too fast, but by jolly he held on to her. He had to, he eyes were blood shot, his cheeks were tear stained but he held on to her. He knew that he was now in charge of this little angel, he called her that, his little angel. That night she fell asleep in his arms, mid sob. He could not sleep, he tried to picture the future, all he saw was darkness. The stars were not shining that night.
I thoroughly enjoy planning my little girls birthday parties. It's my favorite hobby to do and I usually spend the months preceding their birthdays collecting things related to the theme. I also keep a tote in the garage of times of parties past and recycle the things I can to use in party after party.

As far as the Melting Pot experience went, Noah and Kiel weren't exactly fans. I love it, and Rich tolerates it. The boys did great though, even if they weren't thrilled by the food. We were there for at least two hours and both of them handled it quite well. Mommy was proud!
If the apostle really felt that way he would not relate the physical things that happened to him, the earthly scenes he had witnessed, the exotic travels he experienced, for it was the Lord that was pre-eminent in his thoughts and work. So it is to be with us for we read in Colossians 1:18. “That in all things he might have the pre-eminence.”
I'm unclear what put me in such a sea of self doubt and confusion. And free floating worry. Some things in my life are not bad. I think it is the fear of being able to deserve of be prepared for the good things that freezes me in my tracks as I watch myself sabotage the gifts life lays at my feet. I can think of many reasons why I have to do that, but none of them really make sense.
So heres a look at the new covers:
Two nights during the week, I get the opportunity to hang out with a 16 month old. It's funny how life's lessons can be taught through these sessions. Tonight as I was going through the normal routine of bathing, getting jammies, brushing teeth, dosing ty-ty, and reading stories, I was yet again reminded of where my priorities need to be (although, here I am writing instead of reading :-/ ). As Griffin and I sat on the floor in his room, I asked him to pick out a few stories for me to read. The first story was 'Thank you God for the Animals', his second being 'Super Snowy Day', he quickly was sick of that story and grabbed for another book. As I went to grab the book, he opened it, and low and behold it was opened to the story of Easter in his 'Baby's 1st Bible'...the message was pretty clear at that point.

Yes, perhaps I didn't word that too well. We build on our past. However, we don't always make the right choice in improvements. Failures like communism are a perfect example. But, restricting our viewpoints to architecture, we've come a long way in building methods, if not style.
This is the finale of the Gypsy Queen vs. Vintage battle. This has been one of the least viewed things I've ever posted, but I think it was worth it in the end. You see, what amounts to the last vintage "pack" plus the bonus card, are firsts for my collection.
The Giants Defense will handle Michael Vick just as they contained him last time around. If he isn't careful about sliding feet first, he may turn into another Giant Defensive statistic. Last week, the Giants were denied the opportunity to get their hands on Brett Favre so they pounded Tarvaris Jackson into submission instead. I believe he was the 6th or so quarterback the Defense has knocked out of commission this season. Justin Tuck, Cofield, Osi and Jason Paul-Pierre I'm sure will be looking to add another QB to their collection.

As I began by saying, although Swale is relatively prosperous it comes high up in measures of poverty and inequality in Kent and the South East. At the same time business and commerce has decreased in importance and is very much seen as somebody else’s concern.
I should add here that it is incredibly interesting that when I do give into temptation, it doesn’t even really taste all that fantastic anymore, yet I still will finish it.

It was the accepted practice in Babylon 4,000 years ago, that for a month after the wedding, the bride's father would supply his son-in-law with all the mead he could drink. Mead is a honey beer and because their calendar was lunar based, this period was called the honey month, which we know today as the honeymoon. ( Betcha didn't know that)

Lucinda Williams and her band Buick 6 came out about twenty minutes later and went right to work playing selections from throughout her thirty year catalogue of music. She is one of our most gifted songwriters, as well as a powerful singer. The only complaint I have in her first forty minutes was that it was loaded with her more introspective material. Coming right after The Flatlanders spirited set, it made these songs seem even quieter than usual.
These young people were so excited about living in Nebraska! Some of them had spent time elsewhere before choosing to move back to Nebraska and eventually choosing to find a small town to raise their families or have the rural way of life. Another theme that emerged throughout the conference was the need to get young people involved in the local community such as youth representatives on city council, etc. even as early as when they’re in high school. Some people think small town communities in Nebraska are dead…but that’s not necessarily the case. It mostly depends on leadership-a strong leader will rally the town around an idea to grow it or create opportunities. That’s what’s happening in Ord, NE with Caleb Pollard. Another example comes from Fairfield Iowa. Sometimes it just takes the right person to ignite a spark and help the rest of the town see the possibilities. Nebraska has so much to offer!
The rest of Sunday was filled with more everyday chores around the house and ferrying K-boy to his youth group. Then waiting for him to be done. After that shopping and cooking dinner. Relaxing - not so much. I miss my lost hour of weekend!

My third resolution is to hit the gym more often. Well actually just hit the gym. I work nights and sleep during the day. I get up at 15:38 pm every afternoon whether I work or don't. On my days off I could head straight to the gym but I hate that 4 pm crowds. I know this is just an excuse and negative attitude (see first Resolution) but I feel that waiting for machines and weights can really throw a wrench into your work out. I have been working out for 14 years and have studied many aspects in weight lifting, nutrition, and cardiovascular exercises. May of last year I was probably in the best shape of my life. I was working out, eating right, running 5 days a week. I switched hours and wasn't able to stay on the same work out schedule.

Financial professionals understand that the ‘long-term care discussion’ must take place with their clients. Now, with life and annuity-based products, the context of that discussion can be one of reallocating existing assets instead of tapping into precious monthly income to pay for such protection.
This has been a crazy upside-down day for me. Instead of being in my office first thing to do my blog and take care of other writing-related tasks, I was headed to town to do some publicity for a show coming to the Winnsboro Center for the Arts at the end of this month. This is the first theatrical production that I have not directed or had a role in, although I might do tech. Since I am so technically challenged, I'm holding out for other volunteers.

Say, hypothetically, that Salmond tries to finesse his commitment to same-sex marriage, and induces Sturgeon to introduce a Bill initially similar to the proposals being advanced by David Cameron: same-sex civil marriage only, but no capacity for any "religious" bodies to do so, however they might be minded on the subject. By the by, it is worth recalling at this juncture that the bodies who would be banned from conducting such ceremonies include the Humanist Society (who conduct more "religious" weddings in Scotland than the Catholic church). Nevertheless, say moderating unreason takes hold and that is the official governmental proposal. We know that there are many in the parliament - folk in the SNP - who we might expect to argue that...

For a few years now you have been struggling with the fact that you want to be a girl. Everyday that you go to school you see your female classmates and you ache to be one of them. You'll remember the article in the newspaper about the boy who dressed as a girl and won the beauty contest, before been discovered and disqualified. You remember how you wanted them to want to spend their life as a girl and how you were prepared to protect them and wanted to be their partner. Well I know that you actually wanted to be that person, you wanted to be the girl so badly.
The majority opinion carefully avoided addressing software explicitly and directly (the word "software" only appears in the footnotes). Just as the CAFC needed to clarify in Bilski that State Street "addressed a claim drawn not to a process but to a machine," (see footnote 18), it is not unreasonable to conclude that Bilski was meant to address processes not tied to a specific machine. Indeed, the court was careful to point out the "issues specific to the machine implementation part of the test are not before us today" (p. 24). Since Bilski conceded that machine implementation was nonexistent, the court's invalidating decision was based only on the "transformation" leg of the Benson test (see p. 27: the operative question before this court is whether Applicant's claim 1 satisfies the transformation branch of the machine-or-transformation test").

If you enjoy an occasional drink with dinner, you can take comfort in knowing that consuming alcohol in moderation may be good for your heart.

Such people have no real home, political nationalism universally ruined until we must simply await that, that will of course never happen and die as others before wracked by bitterness, it gets easier of course, for I have begun to realise that there are many, many of my own racial kind who are as low as any non-white crook, whose only saving grace is unknown to me and whose sole purpose in life is to create little ripples of unpleasantness wherever they go. Perhaps it is for this reason that the concept of white nationalism is becoming more and more of a fallacy, although what else to call racial bond. Certainly the notion of a brotherhood of the white man is ridiculous to the extreme, amongst us we have the predator, the crook, the anti-group shark and I cannot support such. It has always amazed me that nationalism has for so long now attracted the thug, the ruffian, the hooligan, for indeed these are the self-same elements that should we ever rise to power we would clear from the streets, clear from our communities and chase relentlessly from the group. Of course such people have and indeed are attracted by the manipulations of the owned press ,the machinations of the dark-state, until the people themselves believe nationalists to be thugs, so why not the thugs themselves.

The thing is we suffer terribly alone, and a little less in company. It's why support groups kinda help. But no matter how many people we have around us when we die, when death comes every man must face it alone. In the hospital bed, or laying flapping on the kitchen floor: it's a dire lonely place. A man will never be as lonely or out on a limb as the moment he dies. I know, I've seen it, actually seen death enter the body and come out the other side. The fear and loneliness which that brings about. That's our fate. That's what it all leads to. No matter how much we run, or how many we drag along with us, when death comes it corners us, and every man will die alone. It's the only destiny we have.

What was the importance of Afghan jihad? A new history was written there. In the coming times, how much will the Pakistani nation be responsible for the mistakes that were committed?

If today we do not mend our ways regarding Afghanistan, our future generations will curse us for the tribulations they will inherit from us.

That's the graffiti I saw painted on an electric breaker box on my way to work a couple of weeks ago. "Life is a farce." What a perfect message, and I immediately took it to heart.

I was at my local grocery. And I saw Tilapia on sale. Whole Tilapias. Cleaned and ready to go. Each about a pound or more. Each at a dollar or slightly more. In spite of my apprehensions I picked up a couple. This was way too cheap to avoid. And plus, there is something about whole fishes that attracts me almost instinctively. Of course, once they were in my home and the initial wonderment was over, I had on my kitchen shelves two large 'unloved' fishes staring at me.
To help support her family after her father abandoned them, she dropped out of high school and worked various jobs, soda jerking and waitressing by day at The Triangle Diner[3] across the street from her school, John Handley High. At night, Cline could be found singing at local nightclubs, wearing her fringed Western stage outfits she designed herself and were made by her mother, Hilda.
It has been over a week since my last post. I know, I can't believe it eather. I have been so busy, that I just can't get to writing a blog post that is worth reading. However, I do have a few great stories to tell you. Such as my run in with the Corona girls at the local watering hole. As well as my student outdrinking me this weekend at The Yard House. Or this little riddle, Guess what I received in the mail today. I was shocked, happy, and disappointed at the same time.

I figure $2-3 dollars per article isn’t bad at all due to the networks that allows writers to make money for publishing articles on there network for pennies. Not only are you helping yourself out you are creating a little income for someone else who is looking to make a few bucks online also. For those who work at home and make money online with automated blogs is a dream come true for many that follows the steps from what I have been explaining to you so far, it can be done.
I'm well aware of our country's history of racism and violence, but I truly believe we are better than this filth. As we attempt to rise above our difficult past and look toward a better future, we don't need the New York Post to resurrect the images of Jim Crow to deride the new administration and put black folks in our place. Please feel free to criticize and honestly evaluate our new president, but do so without the incendiary images and rhetoric.
For instance, she uses corn syrup (not to be confused with high fructose corn syrup) because it is composed primarily of glucose, and glucose helps to prevent ice crystals and give a subtle elasticity to the ice cream. She uses cornstarch to bind up water molecules and, likewise, prevent ice crystals. And she uses a small amount of cream cheese because the proteins it contains help to bind the ingredients and give body. It sounds fiddly, and yes, it uses a lot of bowls, but it yields an ice cream that’s creamy, a little chewy, and dense but not heavy, with true, insistent flavor.
Between 2009 & 2010 drivers had the option to use the adjustable front wing flap mechanism. Allowed in the rules in 2009 as a pre-DRS overtaking aid. Although the idea did not really aid overtaking, teams did use it for the driver to alter balance during practice and in race stints.

Magnolia Trees. I love magnolia trees. Locally, the trees grow to majestic heights and the flowers grow quite large with a sweet, subtle, and enticing fragrance.
Among more ordinary mortals, workers in the vineyard, and hangers-on at RAND were Donald Rumsfeld, a trustee of the Rand Corporation from 1977 to 2001; Condoleezza Rice, a trustee from 1991 to 1997; Francis Fukuyama, a RAND researcher from 1979 to 1980 and again from 1983 to 1989, as well as the author of the thesis that history ended when the United States outlasted the Soviet Union; Zalmay Khalilzad, the second President Bush’s ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq, and the United Nations; and Samuel Cohen, inventor of the neutron bomb (although the French military perfected its tactical use).
This is certainly not the opinion of his young disciple Saul when we meet him in Acts 9 and according to Paul’s own self-description. He was a ruthless persecutor who sought to stop what he saw as an aberration within Judaism. The people who Paul persecuted were diaspora Jews who accepted Jesus as Messiah and claimed that he was raised from the dead. How can we account for this violent reaction in a man trained by Gamaliel?

Lots of paper piecing, patterned papers, and dry embossing were used in the making of this card. This is the retro one...do you agree? If not, what style would you call it because it was really hard to pin one down! Since I've used striped paper, I'm linking this to the Crafty Hazelnut's Christmas Challenge: Stripes. Since I used a few punches, I'd like to enter this card into this week's Christmas Card Challenges: Punches Challenge.

Individual liberty versus government authority was from the beginning clearly the conservative message to the great conservative communicator. And he had the same message in his farewell speech as President. He makes it clear there that there is just ONE thing he stood for above all: Individual liberty. Some excerpts:
I am at a turning point in my life. I know that soon decisions have to be made, and choosing the right over the left, or vice versa, will be paramount in discovering not only what job will challenge me, but what feats I will enjoy accomplishing.

“It is deeply satisfying to announce this settlement today. The exclusion of independents from past major settlements such as Kazaa was a key factor in the formation of Merlin, and I am proud to say that this time, via the actions of Merlin, our members’ rights have been properly protected. We will continue to do everything we can to ensure that the labels we represent are never again left out in the cold”.http://www.merlinnetwork.org/home/

Fortunately for all of us, Muramasa is also a lot of fun. While I do spend a lot of time taking in the backgrounds and animation, this is largely due to how responsive the controls are and how well they do what they need to; I never need to fight with the controls to do what I want them to, so I’m afforded the luxury of enjoying the details. As a seasoned veteran of 2D sidescrollers, I’ve played my fair share of excellent action games, and this is one of them. While the game can be difficult at times, I have never died because the game was being cheap or artificially inflating the difficulty. All of the tools to do well in the game are explained in a tutorial at the beginning of the game, and after a few hours of play it becomes clear that all of them are necessary to do well in Muramasa. Since I consider myself fairly talented at action games, particularly beat ‘em up action games, I went for the harder of the two difficulties right away. The higher difficulty level forced me to learn the combat system and not button mash my way through, which I’m fairly certain I would be able to do on the lower difficulty. However, if it had gotten too difficult at any time I could have changed the difficulty part way through the game, which is a nice feature.
12. Prohibition got a big boost from business -- John Rockefeller, Henry Ford, and other industrialists thought it would mean a clean and sober workforce that they could get to work more like the automatons they wanted -- and government -- because the feds now had the income tax and were rolling in revenue, and thought they didn't need booze tax any more. So did Repeal. When Rockefeller saw that his workers were still drunk, and now were sick from bootleg crap booze, and saw the taxes going to pay for an increasingly corrupt enforcement bureaucracy, he did an about-face. When the Depression hit in 1929, income tax revenues dropped, and the feds needed money to pay for jobs programs -- hey, start up the booze biz again, it's a two-fer!

The dough can be kept in a tightly covered bowl in the refrigerator for several days. Pull off as much as you want at a time. To use, let rise at room temperature free of drafts and shape the rolls and let them rise for 1 ½ hours. Bake as above.

If you get that attitude from a bunch of female lawyers what can you expect from the police? Its really not surprising to hear the Assistant Commissioner of Police in Abia State Mr. Micloth say the young woman we watched getting raped on the internet either ‘deserved’ it or ‘consented’. Outrageous yes, but not surprising.

Well, maybe, but you're going to have to get through a lot of rape jokes first. Forewarned.
This is what private charities and foundations set out to do as such. YOU chelas ARE the PRIVATE charities and foundations within yourselves, do you see. It is how you grow and extend out to another brother or sister that will repair the damage to the tapestry or it is you whom will continue the tear or rift in that tapestry.
The down side to going on strike is that one is almost honor bound to cough up a new post after the strike is over or the strike doesn't mean anything. Which is probably for the best because I've been meaning to write about why the list of mostly-shoujo manga hasn't grown much. There are two reasons. One is, I'm lazy. The other is that I got completely sidetracked and started reading a completely different manga unexpectedly. A kind I haven't written about here.
I decided to take him to Firkin and Kegler, with the plan that we’d have lunch there afterwards and make it into an outing that would take up a big chunk of the day. Seemed like a good plan at the time. Plus I’d never been and was rather curious to check it out.

I'm not changing what my shop offers. I'll still be doing cloth diapers, diaper covers, training pants, and more, but I don't want to be limited by a name including cloth diapers if I decide, one day, to change my product. I feel this name makes my shop open to a wider audience. :-D

Food is incredibly important to our family--I think this is true of most Chinese families--and I think part of that is the way it creates a kind of shared experience. It's a way, I think, to share some of the most core and personal parts of yourself--your senses--in a way that most things don't allow you to do. This is one of the most salient things about my mom: the way life, to her, is meant to be shared with the people she cares about. That's why even though she calls me a bazillion times a week, and why even though whenever she calls the odds are good I've already told her everything remotely new or interesting going on, she'll hang up and keep dialing my number again until I drop whatever I'm doing and answer.

Overall I think this movie is good, it’s just a shame that the script is too choppy to really focus in on the relationship of Jung and Freud. Honestly the story is almost too big to be contained in one movie and yet I don’t think it could ever sustain more than one. I think this is a case where the history is more interesting to go read than to watch. Still for lovers of Cronenberg, and people who want to delve into the world of Freud and Jung then this is a good beginning.

Let me give you an example: I buy Del Monte diced canned tomatoes all the time. They’re usually $1.89 at my local supermarket. (Not a typo. I double checked.) Two weeks ago, they went on sale for $1.00 each. That’s a good deal by itself.
