"I’d say that’s fair," Pettitte replied.
Berens was about a half-body length ahead of Phelps at the first turn and never gave up the advantage.

The insidious thing about these increases is that they're applied to just about everyone's pay-TV bill. The major sports networks are included in the same basic tier that offers the most popular advertiser-supported cable channels. Some consumer advocates have called for sports programming to be offered as a separate tier so the cost could be borne solely by sports fans, but the channels have fiercely resisted doing so because it would dramatically shrink their subscriber base. That, in turn, would yield less money to pay the likes of the new Dodgers owners and their star players.
There can be a certain sweet charm to stories of ugly ducklings finding each other; “Marty” certainly did all right with it. But once you met Marty’s mother, you knew why he was the way he was.

And put aside all anxious thoughts and imaginations.
We spent late Saturday night in Midtown Miami, the $2.3 billion-dollar mega-development that has turned into a dining and nightlife establishment that can hang with South Beach on most nights. At Sustain, we ate with a big group that sampled most of the farm-to-table restaurant’s smartly conceived menu. Highlights included the ridiculously rich and satisfying poutine with foie gras and duck confit and an equally ridiculously rich and satisfying s’mores donut. Really solid fried chicken, too. And big bonus points for the restaurant’s playlist, with songs from LCD Soundsystem, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Passion Pit, Miike Snow and the Pixies. Yes, Midtown is good for the hipster crowd, too. After dinner, we popped in for a drink and more dessert (including the excellent torrejas with maple caramel apples) two doors down at Sugarcane Raw Bar Grill. It was after 1 a.m. when we left Sugarcane, which was still packed. Our car rounded the corner and passed by Ricochet, Midtown’s new lounge/performance space. An attractive crowd, dressed to impress, lingered outside. Midtown wasn’t shutting down anytime soon.

Nowhere is the connection between Dartmouth's mural and Pollock's work clearer than in his "Untitled (Bald Woman with Skeleton)" (c. 1938-41), acquired by the Hood six years ago. With a lumpish, crouched female at its center, it quotes the image of a skeletal ribcage and extended limb from Orozco's fiercely satiric panel "Gods of the Modern World." That work had stirred an uproar at Dartmouth over its depiction of a ghoulish cadre of skeletal professors in caps and gowns, overseeing a female skeleton as she gives birth to a skeletal baby with a mortarboard on its head (representing "stillborn knowledge").

I guess Alan Wong, Peter Merriman, D.K. Kodama, Roy Yamaguchi and Bev Gannon, to name a few, will have to wait for the Michelin Guides to visit the islands to finally get their due as detour-worthy restaurateurs, since they didn't make the four- (or five-) diamond list.

In the U.S., protesters lined major financial institutions in the country's most high-profile Occupy Wall Street rallies since the encampments protesting the gap between the superrich and poor came down in the fall.

Galleries are not the only artistic claim to fame for Carmel. Among those artists who lived there was Edward Weston (1886-1958), who settled in Carmel in mid-career.

It's the policy that says we should make streets more pedestrian friendly by placing buildings closer to the sidewalk. That idea was incorporated into the Oshman Family Jewish Community Center on Charleston and San Antonio roads, where a high wall ascends from the sidewalk, and at the old Rickey's Hyatt House site where multi-family units now stand close to the sidewalk, allowing little visual breathing room.

The clash between tourists and congregants plays out every Sunday at Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, the oldest black church in New York state. It's one of many Harlem churches that have become tourist attractions for visitors from all over the world who want to listen to soulful gospel music at a black church service.

But the reality is that these visitors are often filling church pews that would otherwise remain empty - and filling the collection basket with precious dollar bills.
Should the former Massachusetts governor win the Republican presidential nomination, SB 5 is likely to remain a political rallying cry in Ohio. Romney is an established front-runner in the GOP field.

To Roth, "The natural skin and hair, little to no makeup and all the smiling are very refreshing -- especially in our time when everything and everybody seems Photoshopped. I'm trying to communicate a fresh, smart, happy look for an eclectic, pretty girl. She is not, however, overtly prim.

The warmer the climate, the lower the acid and higher the sugar. A wine varietal such as Sauvignon Blanc should be avoided by those who dislike wines with higher acidity.

Yes, I've taught now for more than 35 years. After I left McCluer, I taught at Ladue Chapel in the nursery school. The director, who became my mentor, was Mary Ross.

I listened to her and paid attention to the way people around me spoke and to this day, I think that was one of the most important things anyone ever told me.

As you might expect, there is a great skill in everything that pertains to the automobile, that extends much further than the roads it runs on. No, motor disease has been heard of that the local specialist can't cure, and at a reasonable price. Snagged top? A place that does 'nothing but fix tops. Crumpled fender?

Interestingly enough the writers talked about the crime being a minor one, and some of the people they interviewed didn't even consider what they did was a crime. However in all the cases the words used by the illegals were, "afraid of being caught." They were worried about being stopped and not being able to produce proper documentation because they were here illegally. They know that they are breaking the law but feel like it is not for them to follow this law. How convenient for them, maybe all of us should do the same. If we feel like the law is more of a nuisance then just ignore it. And if our legislators also believe this way, then why even enact these laws? Take them off the books.

Although the underdog story feels artificially pumped-up early on, as the movie tips toward make-or-break bouts for Dustin and Albert, Epperlein and Tucker's psychological acuity merits some cage-match suspense.

Joe Freeman, The Oregonian: Rip City seemed to fall in love with the energy, hustle and athleticism of J.J. Hickson over the final month of the season. His production in a featured role not only kept the Blazers afloat down the stretch, but also offered hope that the team may finally have found a dependable backup for Aldridge. But I don't think Hickson fits into the Blazers' plans for the future. Hickson has enjoyed success during his brief NBA career when he is The Man on a team; when shots come in bunches and playing time is plentiful. But there are questions about what kind of player he would be -- and how happy he would be -- in a limited role. If the price is right -- perhaps in the $3-5 million range per year -- the Blazers might jump at the chance to bring him back. But his performance over the final month of the season, coupled with his ability, likely will net Hickson a more lucrative offseason offer.

Reading is fun. No doubt you've been told that before, but chances are no one's made that argument with quite the vivid physicality that Portland actor Camille Cettina does in this paean to the power of reading. Cettina traces a path of literary discovery from Nancy Drew to Jane Austen and beyond, conveying the little pleasures and great transformations that come when a good book and a ready imagination meet and fall in love. This promising solo theater piece is the first production from Push Leg, a new company founded by Cettina and this show's director, Anne Sorce.
IN A very short time, Hulu has rocketed from nothing to being one of the top video destinations on the Internet.

Reality is a more complicated thing. The nimble, productive, high-profit dynamo that Daniel Gross describes as America’s new economic model is making plenty of people rich. Nevertheless, it is different from the old economy. It requires fewer workers. Those who are lucky enough to have jobs often do not have the benefits, job security and solid middle-class salaries that were more plentiful in the old economy. Older workers may never find a place in this new system. Young people with only a high school education can expect a life of underemployment. Those who have gone deep into debt borrowing to pay for a college education may spend years after graduation waiting tables or making lattes before they find a job that matches their skills.

An unexpected job loss soon puts the couple on the road to Atlanta where George's brother (Marino), a Porta Potty mogul with a perpetually soused spouse (Michaela Watkins), provides a job, a roof over their heads and an unending string of insults. All of which drives George and Linda back to the commune they first stumbled into when they headed down south. Idyllic from its name, Elysium, to the pristine pond, the wrap-around porch and the all-organic everything, this is where the movie really kicks into a new high, for at Elysium, mind-bending ideas and drugs abound.
"This is a fundraiser that was conceived by our patrons and our community, and we are very grateful for their support," Dobbs said in an email to The Star. "It will honor two hometown heroes (Van Arsdale and his twin brother Dick) and their mother, who had a great passion for the library."

The horse that more people seem to love than hate is Union Rags, who was considered the easy favorite before finishing third in the Florida Derby. It was a tough race where he was caught behind horses and ran out of room. But, a truly great horse, finds a way to win. Union Rags didn’t.

Johnson admitted there was a time during the lockout when he thought there might not be a 2011-12 season. "At one point, when they stopped talking, I was like, 'This might be over,'" he said. "Then I got a call at 4 o'clock in the morning, a teammate from college, told me we came to an agreement."
Seems pretty obvious, right? Hang on. The bathrobes in your room may have a price tag, but they're also there to be used during your stay. Off goes the tag. And from there, it's not much of a leap to your unpacked bag. Brenda Rivera, a finance systems specialist from Cedar Park, Texas, says she thinks twice before folding away a hotel bathrobe. "When you know you are going to get charged $125," she says, "you leave it." But she wonders about the amenities that don't have price tags, like towels. It's a gray area, since some hotels have given away towels as a promotion in the past.

"It's a great illustration of a program that did it the right way, and we were still able to win at the highest level," Stansbury said. "There is cynicism that says being a great student-athlete and being able to compete at the highest level are mutually exclusive. But I don't believe that at all.

Jennifer Adams, the named plaintiff, alleges in the suit that 70 percent of Western's 2007-08 graduates earn less than $22,500 a year.

She contends they could get such jobs without WCI's training.

If we're able to do that, we're going to compete in our division."

5. Draft Claiborne: Would the Browns really go defense with the No. 4 pick?

India imports around 70 percent of its oil, and about 9 percent of the imports are from Iran. The U.S. official said India had recently stepped up imports of oil from Saudi Arabia to make up for the reduction in Iranian oil and that the U.S. was eager to see the Indians explore other alternatives. Iran is India's second-largest crude oil supplier after Saudi Arabia and according to media reports imports 550,000 barrels a day.

So I just had a chance to listen to four of your classmates and hear a little bit about how they got here, where they’re headed. I talked to Duane, who was laid off at a packaging company, is now learning how to operate high-tech machinery. Andrea lost her job as an HR analyst, but she's now getting certified in the fast-growing field of electronic medical records. David, who in addition to being a truck driver for 23 years was also a Marine, so we know he can do the job -- he's here to retrain for a higher-paying job. And you just heard from Bronson, who was laid off two years ago, and you heard what he said. He was at a dead end in his life, and this program -- along with his wife -- (laughter) -- gave him an opportunity. So he's going to be learning hands-on machining over the next few weeks, after having already done some of the bookwork.
Using his quickness, Wade broke out on a steal for a two-handed dunk in the first minutes. James, with the angle on him, did not foul. Dwyane Wade with a head of steam up means you have to be smart, said James. If I contest, and he dunks anyway, I could be on the wrong side of SportsCenter.

My last two visits to the Maui outpost had been harried one-day drives to the eastern tip of the island and back. Unfortunately, that's the way most visitors see the region. We jump in rental cars and weave our way through jungles and mountains, stopping along the way to ogle views and play at the edge of waterfalls. The two-hour drive turns into four or six hours, and we're forced to hurry back without much chance to appreciate Hana.

In its monthly energy outlook, the EIA cited high global oil prices as the main reason for the dismal gasoline forecast but added that it expected refineries will seek higher profit margins this year.
All of the men at Seven Oaks are Violet's inferiors, and this also holds true for her sidekicks. Violet (Greta Gerwig) is one of those tall, blond, efficient style-setters who sweep down the hallways of school comedies, scattering instruction and snobbery. Alicia Silverstone used to play these roles. Or think of Cybill Shepherd. The difference is Violet's motives are charitable. She would like to instruct male undergraduates about the delights of underarm deodorants, enlist them in a new dance craze of her own invention, and be of use to them, if necessary, at the suicide-prevention center run by herself and her girlfriends. When you walk through the door looking suicidal, the first thing the center does is offer you a doughnut — but you should see with what alacrity Violet snatches a doughnut back from a pretender.

Late Sunday, four gunmen took over a tall building in the eastern province of Paktika and started shooting down into surrounding government compounds, wounding one civilian.
Randy Newman has frequently been snubbed by the Academy, but they keep bringing the wry songwriter to their big show. He pounded out "We Belong Together" from "Toy Story 3" on a long piano. Newman's sardonic wit is storied, but his songs from movies are relatively anodyne -- for a guy who has written convincingly about slave traders, racist politicians, and dirty old men, he does a fine job voicing the hopes and fears of wholesome cartoon characters. It's another example of his versatility, but it doesn't prevent his film songs from feeling like toned-down versions of what he does so effortlessly on his studio albums.
At its zenith, organizers say, more than 150,000 people would cram 9th Street from Capitolo Playground all the way north to Catharine Street on the designated Sunday. "The crowds that would show up for the festival, it was amazing," said Emilio Mignucci of DiBruno Bros., who grew up on a side street just off 9th. "The night before, I couldn't wait. The Italian Market Festival, for us, was as exciting as waiting for Christmas."

They'll be dancing a rumba (BOO!) to the Temptations' "My Girl." Gladys loves this song. Gladys gives Tristan a history lesson about the Temptations - apparently Gladys & the Pips used to beat the Temptations at softball. Hee. Then Gladys's brother, "The Original Pip," comes in and gives Tristan some Pip Tips. Y'all there is a lot of red fabric happening on these Temptations. Tristan is wearing an incredibly ridiculous purple suit and somehow the heels on his white dancing shoes look silly in a way they don't when he wears black shoes. This is a more interesting rumba than usual - Tristan's not just going for the "vertical expression of horizontal desire" that so many rumbas rely on. Len says that Gladys is top of the leaderboard of his heart. He says that while she's not the best dancer, she's the most charismatic. Bruno wanted a "steamier" rumba. Boo to Bruno. Carrie Ann says tonight should belong to Gladys, but the truth is there were a lot of forgetful movements.

Yet if the goal is to prevent a similar tragedy from happening here, lawmakers need to proceed cautiously on proposals to criminalize the failure to report child abuse. While toughening the state's reporting requirement might give people who witness or suspect child abuse an additional incentive to come forward, it could also have unintended consequences that make matters even worse.

Ramen comes with a choice of four broths -- soy, chicken, miso or vegan. The latter two are subtler, with the chicken making the boldest statement -- especially when amplified by a confit chicken leg, one of half a dozen potential toppings. Each is $1 or $2, which on top of $9 ramen produces something substantial at a less-than-overpowering price.
