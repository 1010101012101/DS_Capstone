Although there is a Number 7 on the label, this is a nonvintage wine. A winery spokeswoman said the pinot noir in the blend had been aged in oak for a year longer than the zinfandel and the syrah. The "7" is a way to identify the bottling. In this bottling, the wine is made of 50 percent syrah, 28 percent pinot noir and 22 percent zinfandel. The label also describes Meditrina as an "American" wine rather than an Oregon wine. The spokeswoman said that was because the zinfandel grapes had been grown in California.

Unlike the more common osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease - the body attacks the lining of a joint as if it were trying to protect it from injury or disease. The lining becomes inflamed and fluid builds up in the joints, resulting in pain, swelling and stiffness that may affect many different joints at the same time. Usually at least two or three different joints are involved on both sides of the body, often in a mirror-image pattern.

At the same time, he’s given away concession after concession to Russia. We can expect more such ‘flexibility’ if President Obama is re-elected.“

If you manage to keep alive a houseplant for, oh, more than a few months, there will surely come the day when it has outgrown its starter pot. The roots will be tangled. It will be gasping for air. It is especially wise to check in on your potted plants at winter's end (especially in certain climes), when the promise of vernal sun brings on hardy growth spurts, and your ready-to-burst houseplant begs for roomier real estate. (Some signs of a houseplant in need of roomier digs: It's top-heavy for the pot, or when roots start emerging from the existing pot's drainage holes.)
I walk my dogs most mornings at a particular greenbelt area. Along the way I meet Bonnie the pitbull and her "dad"; Harley the Australian shepherd and her mom; Anubis the Labrador and his dad; the "parents" of Newfie Buddha, Australian cattle dog Sally, shiba inu Shibi and many others. We always stop to talk with each other while our dogs meet and greet. There's nothing like a happy-go-lucky dog to help break the ice and get people talking. If your daughter is shy, this would be a great way for her to meet people and break out of her shell. Dogs are terrific therapists in this regard.

A: One is that I'm going to start advocating for teachers and their need for professional development as we move forward with the Common Core. That's really going to be a game-changer for our teachers. We need to look at our teachers as we do with our students. We're going to have some of our teachers ready to jump right on and others that are going to need intervention. We need to understand that this is a large change for them.... If we have the concept of "no child left behind," we need to take on the mentality of "no teacher left behind."

Providence bartender Vincenzo Marianella agrees about the ice and the bubbles. "When you're shaking it," he says, "you change the texture of the spirits. Shaking adds not only ice and dissolved water but bubbles.

As with the calamari, the gnocchi ($8) is plated in a pool, here of lemony butter that drips off every forkful. Soft and delicately flavored with milky ricotta and astringent chard, the gnocchi are topped with fork-tender squash and bright squash blossoms.

Colson's outspokenness on behalf of that last group, along with his forceful defense of man-woman marriage and rebukes of everything from moral relativism and aggressive secularism to the spread of euthanasia and Internet pornography, ranked as scandalous in many minds as his Nixon-era offenses.

Debates have turned facile superiority into an art form. The charade of engagement is so popular with the candidates because they can deflect any question that pushes their feet toward the fire.

We would not waste our time exploring the depths of Mr. Limbaugh's misogyny or the likelihood of any genuine "heartfelt" remorse on his part, but we would note that he remains the poster child of public incivility, and the likelihood of further such incidents is high. The fact that advertisers are dropping his show, and some stations have decided no longer to carry it, is no surprise. Mitt Romney and other Republican candidates for office who wish to promote conservative views without them being associated with such personal attacks would be wise to offer a more robust denunciation of the talk show host than they have so far produced.

Both observers also highlighted the division between the center (big downtown performing arts venues, gleaming commercial galleries) and the fringe (out-of-the-way theaters, funky alternative exhibit space). Hicks essentially praised the arts scene here for continuing to do more and more with a little, but wonders if the broader community will appreciate that enough to help out.

But the "Saturday Night Live" veteran's next project could be inspired silliness, especially because it will pit him against a new-generation "SNL" star. In "That's My Boy," current cast member Andy Samberg plays his son -- the product of a teen fling -- whom dad hasn't seen for years. But as Samberg's character approaches his wedding, Sandler's character arrives minus an invite and ready for reconciliation. Do you take this movie as your opportunity to see who'll be more immature?

Hey, Tony: I am a former Clevelander now living in North Carolina. For the past two years, I have been driving down to a nearby bar to watch the Browns play every week. It seem like every week, win or loss, I feel so disappointed about our performance and effort. The worst part about living in N.C. is seeing and hearing how excited fans are about the Panthers.

At 36-37, the Suns are 4.5 games behind eighth-place Memphis in the Western Conference and are closer to their first losing record since 2003-04 (the year before Nash arrived) than to making the playoffs.

With a movie like "21 Jump Street," you wonder why they bothered with the connection at all. It's really just a brand name, and not a wildly adored one. Although there are some brief shout-outs to the show and its cast (wink, wink), the film is just another excuse to inflict more four-letter crotch jokes on Multiplex America. And, in a high school setting, there are also the requisite drugs, geeks, jocks, hot girls and prom jokes.

This is the part where you would say, "Hilarity ensues," but it doesn't. Instead, the trio get involved in a ludicrous murder plot cooked up by a woman named Lydia (Sofia Vergara) that will somehow lead back to the main plot; astounding coincidence is a common device in the movie. Which can be fine if it's used to good comedic effect. Here, it just seems lazy. By the time Moe joins the cast of "Jersey Shore," you're likely to have long since given up caring.

A: You know, that is something that has been perpetuated that is in fact completely false. I thought you might say that, so here's a quote from a letter from the counsel general of Canada dated February 2011. He writes that "the government of Canada has no interest in disadvantaging the Ambassador Bridge's long-term sustainability."

As Sherman's work itself transformed over the decades, it has become something of a self-perpetuating spectacle, growing more and more impressive (the scale! the vivid color! the inexhaustible variety of disguises!) but less relevant, less resonant on a personal level.

Instead, four simple steps can nudge your body composition back into the safety zone -- and none involves the words diet, calories or weigh-in.
Perhaps one reason college baseball is growing is because of its fan friendliness. It hasn't yet fully prostituted itself to TV networks and still caters to the paying customers who attend games. Players are accessible to fans, and fans grow attached to the players.

Christie’s budget-cutting moves have been common conservative ideas for decades. ALEC encapsulates many of them in reports written for cash-strapped states: Use line-item vetoes to trim budgets. Roll back pensions and health benefits for public workers. Freeze cost-of-living adjustments. Cut funds for mental health care. Tighten Medicaid eligibility requirements. Transition from institutional care to home- and community-based care. Privatize off-track betting.

But as Louis-Dreyfus finished her "Seinfeld" story, walked back into the ornate make-believe offices of Vice President Meyer on that Columbia soundstage and started sounding decidedly duplicitous and scheming in the lines she spoke, I couldn't help wondering if this high-buzz HBO series wasn't in some small way, at least, Elaine goes to Washington — with some of the smartest guys in American and British pop culture driving the limousine.

Nagbe, the second overall pick of the 2011 MLS SuperDraft and the Timbers' first-ever MLS SuperDraft pick, played in a MLS game for the first time since having surgery March 4 to repair a sports hernia. Oddly, Nagbe said he felt a little fatigued after just a couple of minutes on the field.
Some of the songs seem instantly familiar. The central riff of “It’s a Shame,” for instance, got recycled in the “Darkness” track “Streets of Fire.” “Come On (Let’s Go Tonight)” has the same melody as “Factory” and a line that would later show up, in slightly modified form, in “Out in the Street” (“Put on your black dress, baby/And put your hair up right”).

A: I think certainly there's a window to profitability that you have to think about. And you need to be close to it. When we look out, it's one of these things where we're actually fairly close and we're in a good position. Should (an investor) be expected to look out four or five years? No, I think that's too far. With energy and cleantech, it might be more appropriate to look out two or three years.

A: Never going to do that again. I'm so not interested in producing, other than doing my own work, producing my own films. I only do it as favors, for other people to get their films made. But that's not the big-time suck. The big-time suck for me was that (frequent writing partner) Jim Taylor and I spent over two years, full-time, writing a script for a fairly large-scale science-fiction social satire that I'll get back to in a couple years.
