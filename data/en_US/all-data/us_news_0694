MOSCOW (AP) - A plane that crashed Monday into a snowy field in Siberia, killing 31 people, appears to have been improperly de-iced, but there was no indication that negligence caused the crash, Russia's civil aviation chief said.

But their Friulian roots still called. Recalling his work with Krankl, Bertoz found some Viognier in Russian River Valley and hauled it back to Napa in a decrepit 1972 El Camino. Then he discovered grapes familiar from their childhoods, Pinot Bianco and Malvasia, in Sonoma's fastidiously farmed Saralee's Vineyard. In 2007, he called owner Saralee Kunde and secured enough for a first vintage. Arbe Garbe - it means "bad weeds" in Friulian dialect - was born.

California has been called the great exception. From the mystic aura of the name itself to the conquest of outer space, California has inspired greatness among its many immigrant people. Gold, forests, rich agricultural fields, high technology, universities of excellence, the Pacific horizon, diverse ethnic groups  all these have converged to keep our state a dream for the hundreds of thousands who still cross our borders each year.

Over 14 million motor vehicles each month set new records in gallons of gasoline consumed and miles driven over our roads.

We both are pretty philosophical in that when you're hot, you're hot; when you're not, you're not. If you put any emphasis on what you did right and what you did wrong, it'll make you crazy. You'll never know why you get a job and why you don't. My job is to stay up and engaged and enjoying life, period. The rest of my career will handle itself.

The things that most need reversing are the downward spiral of our regional economy even before the onset of the recession; the extent of racial segregation; and alarming rates of poverty, teen pregnancy and violence and failure to graduate high school. It distresses me that Cleveland, unlike Chicago, for example, turned its backside to the lake. And downtown, despite wonderful attractions, often feels deserted. Perhaps worst of all, there is a profound absence of effective leadership, and a desperately needed civic conversation about our city's and region's future is lacking.

Most roofers use pneumatic nail guns to nail down shingles. When the pressure is set too high, the nails get driven in to the shingles too far, plain and simple. When the nails are overdriven, the heads of the nails punch right through the mat of the shingle. This voids the shingle manufacturers warranty and greatly increases the potential for shingles to come loose and blow off, possibly in sheets. The diagram below shows what proper and improperly driven nails look like.

Looking past them, at sails being raised on the three other masts and at the sun setting off our starboard, I thought about how rare (and how high) this view is - you can be 10 decks up on a mega-cruise ship, but still feel like you're in an office building. From this perch, there's vastness - a startling amount of empty space between me and the deck, plus an open panorama of stern, prow, port and starboard of the ship.

"Liam was just like all the other piglets, except for one thing. … Liam wanted to be the Easter Bunny." He practices hopping, eating salad and delivering eggs, with varying degrees of success. His family, at least his parents, work hard on the we-love-you-just-the-way-you-are speeches. The grandparents suggest Liam's problem is fixable, and grandma's response, when Liam asks if she knows "how to make an Easter Bunny suit," is worth the price of admission. (No spoilers here.)

A survey in March by site operator HomeAway Inc. found that the most popular markets among vacationers this year are those that can be reached in a drive of four hours or less from home. That makes those markets good investment opportunities for the 91% of vacation-home buyers who plan to rent their properties when they aren't using them.

All the principals do lively work, along with Susan Cella as Albert's overbearing mother and Leslie Denniston and Lewis J. Stadlen (channeling a hint of Paul Lynde, who created the role) as Kim's parents.

"Many of these growers are also clamoring for insecticide," said Joe Spencer, an entomologist with the Illinois Natural History Survey, at the University of Illinois.

Now that the federal government's bond rating has been lowered and the markets have gone all nutso, Illinois can ill afford more drama.
But I'm not sure this law would have helped. Our do-gooder Legislature is almost certain to pass AB 1450, but don't expect this "discrimination" to end or for unemployment to fall any faster. Instead, employers will find ways to skirt the law or simply make do with the workers they've got until the economy picks up again. Count on it.

Yet Hollande is just one of five leftists in Sunday's race - and he's the most moderate and pragmatic of the bunch.

But as an athlete, Yeung understands when sports metaphors get used incorrectly. She's heard the term "chip shot" to refer to someone trying to speak more for the sake of speaking, rather than to communicate a specific point.

Let's kick off this "Real Housewives of New Jersey" recap by stating for the record that I haven't seen acting this bad since Gia Giudice auditioned for that Christian Slater film. And I'm not even talking about Gia's acting -- I'm talking about Teresa Giudice denying she's a stage mom. It's just so obvious that every single scene here is a carefully (or not so carefully) orchestrated set piece, from Christine Staub's oh-so-offhand revelation that Teresa has been talking about Danielle Staub's search for her birth mother to Caroline Manzo's casual visit to the Brownstone, where son Chris tries to set her up on a lunch date with Kim Granatell, to Kim G.'s excrutiating blow-out with Danielle at an upscale Italian trattoria.

One thing the Yankees will have to monitor, should Pettitte earn his way onto the staff, is the 39-year old pitcher’s workload. Taking a year off is one thing, but Pettitte only threw 129 innings in 2010 (and 14 more in the postseason). Will he have the stamina?
Longevity like that is astonishing, given that a restaurant marking its 10th birthday is considered an odds-defying institution in this town.
"Running shoes, however, typically include heavily cushioned heels. This leads our brain to think 'land heel first, it's safest.' The opposite is true. The calcenous or heel bone is magnificently designed for walking, helping us balance over any kind of terrain, but while running, our bodies are designed to disengage the heel. When we don't, we lose the natural 'spring' created from toe running."

Those are both worthy goals, but the City Council and the new program manager authorized by the consent agreement should scrutinize the mayor's budget for its effect on other issues.

Every spot in the order produced at least a run.

A family video shows him spinning in circles and struggling to make the sound "bah" -- while his twin sister, Eleanor, talks in full sentences.

But distrust of the United States in the wake of deadly drone attacks and the deaths of 24 Pakistani soldiers in a cross-border battle in November is such that rather than calling for more U.S. aid to build needed power plants, schools and hospitals, a growing number of Pakistanis want nothing to do with the United States.

In the absence of suspense, the filmmakers' challenge was holding the audience, despite the atmosphere of inevitability. They set out to do this in two ways  first by following the various and fascinating trails of self-interest, as they miraculously converge.

And that would be mostly mozzarella and salumi, and I love both. I consider the time I was served an entire bowlful of fresh, milky bocconcini (bite-sized mozzarella) in Naples one of the supreme food experiences of my life. That experience can't be replicated in L.A. — we can't get cheese that fresh — but Obikà does a good job of serving up some of the freshest mozzarella around.

Hartnell has only two postseason goals after leading the Flyers with 37 in the regular season. James van Riemsdyk is still finding his legs after missing time with a broken foot. After Giroux and Briere, no other Flyer has more than three postseason goals.

As for the robbery claim, that's a common misconception. While it's true that much has been taken out of the trust fund to help balance the budget (and thus avoid other forms of tax increases), less often observed is that the legislature has also occasionally supplemented the trust fund with general fund revenue as a form of repayment or to enable certain projects to be built.
Everyone in the sector was inspired by Walt Disney’s purchase of New York-based mom blog site, Babble Media, last year for an estimated $40 million to $45 million.

“Any time I get on stage, I just give 200 per cent,” DeAngelus adds. “And Graham does the same. You have to show emotion. I think people can tell when you don’t. Sometimes when we play shows in Brooklyn or Manhattan, you can feel the vibe. We’ll be paired with these hipster noise bands, and when we play, people will stand there thinking ‘those guys are just playing rock.’ They don’t think it’s artsy or cool enough. We’ve definitely experienced that over the years. But I still think the best show you can see is a band that’s just rocking out and showing emotion and having fun on stage, and feeding off the energy from the audience."

It's called "decision fatigue," says Roy Baumeister, a social psychologist at Florida State University, and it depletes our willpower. Add to that a drop in glucose that often happens by late afternoon, making us crave cookies or some other quick-carb infusion.
Have a look around this year's IPL, however, and cricket's dad's army is out in force. Rajasthan Royals are, as ever, the leaders when it comes to a resolutely non-ageist recruitment policy; having swapped last year's 41-year-old captain Shane Warne for Rahul Dravid, a relative stripling at 39, they also regularly field both Brad Hogg (41) and Brad Hodge (37). Kings XI Punjab are skippered by Adam Gilchrist (40) and Pune Warriors by Sourav Ganguly (39), while Murali (40) plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore and Sachin Tendulkar (39), the newly appointed MP, still turns out for Mumbai Indians.

Hey, Hoynsie: If Lonnie Chisenhall continues to struggle at third (three errors in six games at Columbus), shouldn't the Indians have him play some left field, since we are lacking outfielders with pop? Martin Prado of the Braves has played left and third and it did not hurt him. In a couple of years, we may have Francisco Lindor at short and Asdrubal Cabrera at third, so why not have Chisenhall play some left in addition to third? -- Joe Eversole, Pelham, Ala.
A: Well, of course the first thing you worry about is the fans’ reaction, but it’s also the first thing you have to get out of your mind. Once you get on set, you just have to let go of all of that and follow your instincts and listen to your director and just get on with it.
Hey, Tony: Why was Harrison not immediately ejected from the game, and will he be able to walk out of Cleveland Browns Stadium on his own power after the game in Cleveland?

"Coming out of spring training you have a lot of people preaching like we are to be aggressive, get good leads," Matheny said. "To read a ball off the bat you have to have some instinct. Everything looks right. The swing, the timing looks right, and you've taken an extra half step to where you're momentum is carrying you too far. An average thrower isn't going to be able to get you because of that extra half step, but Yadi is different. That extra half step is going to cost you. There's a chance for him to come out right from spring and catch a couple guys not necessarily ‘napping' but being more aggressive."

As a kid, I always looked forward to my own family's card nights at our house, where we'd play games like hearts or Michigan rummy or something called fan tan, which I suspect most people today have never even heard of.

Still, the heat wave and dry spell that began this July make this a noteworthy summer.

Yes, the Browns' trick plays crippled the Saints. Some timely first downs, especially in the fourth quarter, helped. But the meat on the dawg bone was Ryan's amoeba defense, whose various forms confused the Saints' offensive line and rattled Brees -- regardless of what the quarterback said afterwards.

6. "Community" (NBC): It's past time that this series got full credit for being one of the best lunacy courses on television. Although never nominated for anything when award shows roll around, the community-college comedy is often goofily innovative and genially eccentric. It also boasts one of the most able ensembles in the prime-time ranks, including Joel McHale, Danny Pudi, Gillian Jacobs, Chevy Chase and East Cleveland native Yvette Nicole Brown. Even NBC's executives, who put the show on hiatus last month, don't seem to realize what they have.

Accidents all over the city and county do not exemplify preparation! Apparently, Kingshighway is not on the " To-Do" list. There was not a speck of salt or splash of brine anywhere in the vicinity! In fact, when I stepped out of my vehicle, I was met with a smooth layer of slick ice on which myself and everyone else carefully shuffled on. Notably, there was another accident just 40 feet away on the same stretch of road.

To the victor go the spoils. In college and NFL power rankings, one team beating another does not necessarily correlate to where they stand in relation to each other. For example, when the Ravens lost to the Titans in week two, no one outside of Tennessee was clamoring for the Titans to leapfrog the Ravens. But high school is different. There are only 12 teams, and the season is only ten weeks long. Reservoir beat Glenelg on the field, and there's no way I could rank Glenelg ahead of Reservoir a week later. Besides, the Gators have the third best point differential (+11.7 ppg) in the league.

Larger businesses in the heart of Silicon Valley suffer fewer direct impacts -- their buildings are newer and stronger, many of them retrofit with rubber isolators, their insurance better, their savings larger, their emergency plans more carefully laid. But they are not unscathed. Even if your building is standing, you can't run a business if you can't flush your toilets. You can't run a business if your employees can't get to work. Many types of manufacturing can't be done without water -- and industrial use comes well after emergency and drinking water in the rationing scheme. Business owners begin to consider alternatives.
