øBe careful, though, before you go on a wild goose chase for yield. Remember that when you own shares of an individual stock you are subjecting your principal to more market risk than if you buy a basket of investments. If Royal Dutch Shell, for instance, were to face litigation risk or a decline in earnings, then you would likely see the value of your investment fall relative to the broader stock market.

Obama is right that "no magic bullet" can kill high gas prices. It's true that day-to-day swings in gas costs are beyond the control of any president. But Americans find other Obama remarks hard to swallow. For example, his assertion that drilling for more U.S. oil won't lower prices. Americans understand a basic law of economics: more supply of a product usually means lower prices.
Well, maybe not, as the movie takes a couple of interesting turns and spotlights a few solid performances. As a director, Ben Affleck is no Michael Mann, that’s for sure (and he’d probably be the first to agree).

Going to Park 'N Eat was a rare and wonderful thing in 1962. Today, going to a fast-food restaurant is as much a part of our lifestyle as cell phones and computers. Truth is, the big problem these days is finding a fast-food place you haven't tried.
I have never seen a doughnut place where they make their dough and stuff from scratch in-house. I was wondering to myself, "How do they make their doughnuts so good?" And I realized it's because everything is done there and baked and proofed there right before you eat it. Most doughnut places are all front-of-house, with just a little bit going on in the back. Everything at Voodoo is done right there in front of you.

Instead, he sculpts realistic facsimiles from Aqua-Resin, a nontoxic, moldable resin that can be spread on metal mesh forms and painted with thinned-down acrylic paints. Holes cut in the mesh form create pockets for plants, and the finished piece of “driftwood” or “coral” provides some artful topography for the terrarium. If you have worked with papier-mâché, Druse says, you’ll find these materials easier to use. (Sold in craft stores, Aqua-Resin is available online from the Compleat Sculptor, sculpt.com.)

I thought it'd be fun to pick a freely available mobile game each week and challenge you to play along. This week, because we're all still a little sore over this, I thought we'd try our hands at PikPok's Flick Kick Field Goal, available in a free or premium ($.99) version on the App Store and Android Market. While it looks and feels like kicking in a pro football game, this game takes you back to a simpler time, when gaming was a tightly-folded sheet of notebook and a friend with index fingers and thumbs for goalposts. The "flick" part of the equation works exactly it should, with no unnecessary device-tilting required. With a little practice you'll be banging home 58-yarders in major crosswinds. My high score in "Sudden Death" mode was 117. Give it a go and let us know how you fared in the comments. Laces out!

Under U.S. regulations, only healthy cattle may be slaughtered for meat.

Of course, the bill is unconstitutional. The whole point of the new abortion bans is to force the Supreme Court to reverse Roe v. Wade. It's unconstitutional to place an "undue burden" on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy, although it's anyone's guess what, precisely, that means. One would be inclined to suspect, however, that unwanted penetration with a medical device violates either the undue burden test or the right to bodily autonomy. But that's the other catch in this bill. Proponents seem to be of the view that once a woman has allowed a man to penetrate her body once, her right to bodily autonomy has ended.Tim Griffin, writing for Red State, says he has some concerns about the Virginia law, but he supports it and argues that pro-choice advocates are going overboard with their objections:

If you're a spectator, by no means is this an impossible voyage, but it took me about 90 minutes to make a 20-minute trip. The security lines were a hassle.

We'll get more in-depth on this topic later in our Seton Hall Bubble Watch, but for right now — yes, the possibility is there. The question is will all of the pieces fall into place for it to happen? Seton Hall is going to be on the cut line, either in the last two in the field or the first two out of it. Probably no higher or now lower. What the Pirates will need is for chalk to reign supreme across the country. That means a Temple winning the A-10 instead of a Saint Joseph's or Dayton. That means Kentucky keeping pedal to the metal in the SEC and not Tennessee squeaking through to pull the upset. That means the Pac-12 going to a Washington or California and not say, UCLA. The fewer bubbles that burst for Seton Hall, the better its chances will be to stay on that borderline and keep the Selection Committee staring at its resume. And perhaps the longer they stare and examine, the more they like what they see. That's about the best Seton Hall has to hope for right now. Because they can't do anything else.

But a quick tip: Before embarking on a venture of this kind, it is crucial to don comfortable shoes, so as to be able to walk off what you do to yourself. This is not the time — believe me because I know — for the new sandals purchased at said thrift shop, no matter how cute they are.

So who does get hurt? Clearly, somebody is going to lose out in this process: Holders of American's common stock are likely to lose much or all of their value; retired employees are likely to see their pensions and retiree benefits severely curtailed; current employees will face significant pay cuts, loss of some benefits, and downgraded retirement programs; and big creditors may be asked to accept some form of future equity in exchange for American's outstanding debts.

This one's a no-brainer: Replace every lightbulb in your house with a compact fluorescent lightbulb (CFL). They cost more to buy than incandescent bulbs, but they use 75 percent less energy, so they pay for themselves and then some over their lifetime in the form of lower energy bills. In fact, you can save $30 a year by replacing just one incandescent with a CFL.

As for the location of Lodi wine country, the nice version goes like this: If you follow the marine breezes through the Golden Gate and up through the tranquil waters of the north bay, and then over miles of bird-filled wetlands, you'll come to a peaceful, Mediterranean flatland of old Zinfandel vineyards—Jessie's Grove being the very oldest. The not-so-nice version puts Lodi wine country smack in between I-99 and I-5 in the heart of the Central Valley, bordered on the north by the Sacramento suburbs and on the south by sprawling Stockton.

But a disruption of the vital Persian Gulf chokepoints — the Abqaiq processing plant in eastern Saudi Arabia, the Ras Tanura terminal on the Saudi Arabian coast, or the two-mile-wide sea lane of the Strait of Hormuz — would be devastating. If one, two or three of them is hit by terrorists flying hijacked jumbo jets or shut down by Iranian military action, as much as 40 percent of all seaborne oil will be stopped, as much as 18 percent of all global supply will be interrupted, and more than 10 percent of the U.S. supply will be cut off. Estimates on the U.S. shortfall suggest the percentage lost could be far higher. Repeat attacks, and the difficulty of anti-mine operations in a hostile environment, could prolong the crisis for many months — which is exactly what al-Qaeda and the Iranian regime have promised. Yet, apparently, there is no government plan.

Which, in a way, is good, but they seem to expect perfection all the time. I really enjoy going overseas more to play in front of the fans over there. They seem to really understand the difficulty and they show their respect for your shots based on the true difficulty of the shot, and I wish the fans over here would learn a little bit from that.

I suspect the Cavs will bring a much better effort. The Mike Brown-coached Lakers have a big game Saturday night against the Clippers. Could the Cavs catch them looking ahead? Probably not.

He's constantly trying too hard to impress both personally and professionally, and he's desperately hoping to keep his marriage alive with the increasingly distant Linda (Judy Greer). All of these comic actors find different sorts of laughs  sadder, truer ones  by toning down some of their usual tendencies. They're no less effective this way, but the shift does provide an unexpected tone.
His skill with cues brought him two Oscar nominations, first for "The Hustler" in 1961, then for "The Color of Money," for which he finally won, in 1986.

The worst thing that ever happened was my brother, sister-in-law and my husband went to race America's Cup boats while the rest of us went shopping in St. Bart's. I picked that because I get seasick. There were terrible seas that day, and the ferry (to take me shopping) was much smaller than expected. It was a 45-minute ferry boat ride from hell. They should have canceled it, but they chose not to. Waves were washing up over the second story. People threw up all over the place. We got there too late for the shopping tour, so we found a beach and had lunch on the beach. It was $230 for the four of us, and two of us just had a bowl of gazpacho. Then it started to rain. Turns out, the ones that went on the America's Cup trip said they had the best trip of their lives.

Q: Hey, Brian: What is the Cavs' front office and ownership philosophy about needing to have a superstar to win an NBA championship? Most basketball executives feel this way, and the Pistons and Trail Blazers are viewed as the only exceptions to teams that won the title without a superstar.

The more fundamental problem, however, lies in the book's overall analytical lens. For example, in describing the administration's halting efforts to deal with the problems of the housing market, Scheiber says officials were "worried about the dreadful politics" of bailing out homeowners who had gotten over their heads in debt while doing nothing for those who had been prudent. "Yet as terrible as a trillion-dollar housing bailout was politically, it wasn't as bad as 9% unemployment and a stagnant economy for the rest of the president's term."

I tweaked the recipe in a few places. After sampling the cookies with and without their chocolate coating, I preferred the latter. The former, while closer in spirit to the Thin Mints ideal, becomes the very definition of overkill, although the coating's semisweet chocolate is a nice foil to the cookie's sharper cocoa bite. The coating was also taking forever to set, so I transferred the coated cookies to the refrigerator, and that did the trick. It also reminded me: Aren't Thin Mints better when swiped from the freezer?

Finally, no one knows who the rebels are, and there are legitimate concerns their numbers include significant Islamist extremists of the al-Qaida variety. That's why the rebels are not, according to the Wall Street Journal, getting weapons and money from the very Gulf Arab states that have issued international calls for that kind of aid. So much for Graham's idea of military assistance through the Arab League.

Brunch was divine. We had our choice of … everything: breakfast desserts. Small shrimp were arranged in spoons and dotted with cocktail sauce; large shrimp were skewered, topped with herbs and grilled. Because we were in the South, I washed the meal down with iced tea.

It is an accomplished work of art, but it is a grueling story, one whose depictions of brutality and desire may be too challenging for some readers — in fact, the excerpts here omit some of the strong language used throughout the book. In its final section, Abdul is institutionalized, swimming into consciousness only intermittently. He's not sure where he is, or what's he's done. He's been framed or he's confused or he's guilty.

Franco mixes these high and low interests in all sincerity, mustering equal amounts of enthusiasm for his ongoing stint as a deranged performance artist on "General Hospital" as for the demanding movie role that many think will land him an Oscar nomination.

Hardest part was trying to keep many of these coaches in line. We told each one straight up that Kevin was 17 years old and all communication will come through us and not to be bothering him at school and random phone calls all hours of the day. The ones who followed the simple rule got to the next level. The one’s who didn't listen, had to deal first hand with Kevin's mom. One coach even got thrown out of our house. Funny part of it was that it was the first home visit that Kevin had gotten and he didn't know what to do as the coach was being thrown out.
