But critics of the state's decision say the federal money could have helped the state deal with the debt. The state could have obtained the money quickly but would not be obligated to start spending it for a year. In the meantime, while revenues are down, it could have used some of the money toward debt reduction or interest payments, Dixon said.

With Pelfrey out, attention turns to right-hander Chris Young, who is building arm strength at the club’s complex in Port St. Lucie, Fla. Young missed the majority of 2011 with anterior capsule surgery, but has progressed far enough in his rehab to face hitters. He pitched in a simulated game today – as did Jenrry Mejia, who is rehabbing from Tommy John. Young may appear in a Class-A Florida State League game this weekend, assistant general manager John Ricco said.
Police officials shuddered at the thought of employing that technique on the sloped, tree-filled lawns of City Hall that were covered with scores of tents. And while it might push protesters out of the park, it would not have given police control over how they dispersed, the officials said.
Norris makes a similar suggestion, voiced directly through the arrogant Cash, but I think reflective of the writer’s own view. Cash asserts that liberals like his brother and sister-in-law are guilt-ridden because they don’t really practice what they preach, and therefore are no better than the materialistic conservatives that they hate. He has a point, surely, in terms of inconsistency in behavior. But Cash’s prescription -- don’t change what you practice, just change what you preach -- makes a fundamental mistake: It denies any validity or value to ideals. It argues that if you fail to live up to your ideals it is the ideals that have failed. That’s no kind of basis for an ethical argument.
John Ellis is an adjunct professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. In an earlier version of this column, Dr. Ellis was misidentified as a University of Chicago professor.
International human-rights groups and some athletes' organizations have expressed concern over the ability of participants and spectators to speak freely during the Games.

"You can game plan for it, but until you get on the floor and defend it, it's a very difficult offense to defend," Dickerson said Wednesday. "Not a lot of teams use that offense.

Without question, the movie is the most reverent work the irreverent Farrelly brothers have done, with nary a trace of the filmmakers' edgier side slipping into this family fare. For all the physical antics and the general stupidity that is a Stooges trademark, it's a strangely gentle comedy, not quite the ridiculous laugh riot fans of the trio might expect, but a very amusing escape from anything that resembles the real world.

Come dessert, go with the cannoli. How often do you see the classic Sicilian dessert on a menu around here? These have a beautifully crisp shell and a very sweet ricotta filling. Chocolate crostata gives a bittersweet chocolate fix: It's sort of a fudge pie soft as pudding. Sheep's milk yogurt panna cotta, though, is excessively sweetened with honey, far too much of a good thing. The good thing is that you can follow up the sweets with a caffè corretto, an espresso "corrected" with grappa.

Last year, Durham agreed to plead guilty to aggravated murder and save the state from an expensive death-penalty trial if the judge agreed to let him feast on his favorite foods. The judge agreed, and Durham sat down to a smorgasbord of KFC chicken, Popeyes fried chicken, mashed potatoes, coleslaw, carrot cake and Haagen-Dazs ice cream. Two weeks later, at his sentencing, he dined on calzones, pizza and lasagna.

What we have today are two diametrically different world views. There is the liberal, pro-union, pro-regulation, capitalist/social welfare view that sees labor unions as positive forces for egalitarianism; regulators as necessary to level the playing field and ensure adherence to health, safety regulations and equal opportunity requirements; and government actively helping those who cannot make it on their own. And there is the conservative, anti-union, pro-free market, Darwinian/self-sufficiency view that sees labor unions as defenders of the status quo, regulators as thwarters of free enterprise and the government as fostering dependency and stifling individual initiative.

Fortunately, if we're about to enter a battle over classroom instruction on climate change, it won't go on for decades, because the impacts of global warming are already patently obvious. Seven of the 10 warmest years since global record-keeping began in 1880 have occurred in the 21st century. Despite an intense campaign to discredit his work, Pennsylvania State University professor Michael Mann's "hockey stick" graph, which shows that temperatures in the latter half of the 20th century soared to their highest level in 1,000 years, has been validated repeatedly. Last year set a record for the most climate-related disasters in the United States costing more than $1 billion in damage each — drought-fueled wildfires in Texas, Hurricane Irene, and Mississippi River flooding were among the 14 cases.
Across the digital landscape, the issue of online privacy is taking center stage. In recent months, large institutions and tiny app-makers alike have been accused of mishandling personal data.

"I hope people walk away knowing what art can do," he says, pointing out that the arts can teach young people important life skills, no matter what career they pursue. "If you're an artist, you're a hard worker, usually, because you have to think about something, you have to watch it develop, you have to revise, you get critiqued, and you have to put yourself out there--those are things that you need in the real world."
Another reason, he said, is "You don't know who might run if you don't."

But it's difficult to remember a more unlikely victory. This has been a historically bad season for Arizona and, arguably, one of the worst teams in school history. Coach Mike Stoops was fired. Arizona's only victories were over Northern Arizona and UCLA. Just last week it was blown out by a miserable Colorado team, 48-29.
Unlike during the two-month jury trial, when Estrada was clean-shaven and wore a suit and tie to court every day, on Tuesday he was brought to court in jail garb, his short sleeves revealing a tattoo-covered arm. He had grown a bushy goatee. He sat next to his public defender, Charlie Gillan, with his back to the widow as she expressed her sorrow and anger. Gillan had told his client not to make a statement.

“Anything can happen in an 18-hole tournament,” Vajda said. “If we were playing 36 holes, like they do at most states, I would feel pretty confident.

For a couple of batty old shut-ins, "Big Edie" and "Little Edie" Bouvier Beale have been an oddly enduring source of public fascination. The pair made headlines in the early 1970s when county health officials inspected the East Hampton, New York, mansion known as Grey Gardens and found the mother and daughter -- an aunt and cousin, respectively, of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis -- living amid trash, stray cats, raccoons, fleas and the decaying remnants of what once had been the glamourous trappings of American aristocracy.
While home prices are still 30 percent below the mid-2006 peak, their new direction should bring relief to both lenders and homeowners.

Maryland’s competition for Rowe was Gardner-Webb, which should sufficiently demonstrate just how off the radar he was when he committed to the Terps in June. The signal-caller proceeded to have an excellent senior season, throwing for 2,722 yards, 33 touchdowns and seven interceptions on 141-for-220 passing, while also rushing for three touchdowns. Rowe later earned MVP honors at the Offense-Defense Bowl. “Once he gets some strength, he’s certainly got a live arm,” Shurburtt said. “He’s tall and he can run the system. He’s a smart kid.”

Boston College coach Jerry York reminded his players of the "really impressive" record Air Force has in the NCAA Tournament. The Falcons are 1-4 all time, having never advanced to the Frozen Four. However, they stunned Michigan in 2009, and all of their defeats have been by one goal — against Yale in overtime in 2011, to Vermont in double overtime in 2009, to Miami in overtime in 2008 and to Minnesota in 2007.

"Tonight was the first night that I felt my confidence level was there. After I missed that one shot, I didn't dwell on it after I did against Rutgers. I continued attack from the other side.

Yet it would be a mistake to assume the city's financial problems will end with the passage of Proposition B. The San Diego Unified School District is facing deep financial problems, and the district's failure and subsequent takeover by the state would have a devastating effect on the city's economic recovery, city finances, our ability to recruit new businesses, home values and our children's futures. That's why I've offered the most comprehensive plan of any mayoral candidate to get city schools on the right track. The plan is available on my website at

Colorado's Ryan Deehan (6-4 , 255 pounds) showed some good things at the school's pro day. Scouts thought he handled himself well, and while his 4.87 showing in the 40 is a bit of a concern, it was still faster than several of the tight ends who were invited to the combine. Several teams believe in some offenses Deehan, who started 13 games last season, could improve enough to be a team's No. 3 at the position.

I cannot claim to be a die-hard birder or an expert trekker, but I am a sucker for superlatives. And so, in hopes of wandering a bit off the Gringo Trail — and to catch a glimpse of Peruvian countryside unspoiled by commerce or crowds — this spring my husband and I found ourselves disembarking at Rodríguez Ballón International Airport in Arequipa, sturdy shoes laced on our feet and binoculars stowed in our bags.
I've noticed a couple of things. First, a lot of stores are not discounting merchandise as aggressively as maybe you saw last year or the year before. That is a good thing from a profitability standpoint.

Even so, Crawford and coach Nate McMillan said before tipoff that Crawford would play. But at the last second, according to a source close to the situation, all parties -- the Blazers, Crawford and Miller -- decided it was best for Crawford to sit. Crawford, who was not available for comment after the game, has been playing with right knee tendinitis in recent games and the sides did not want to risk an injury with a near-certain trade in the works, the source said.
The roof was off. Now it's back on. The pricetag for taxpayers is still unknown. What's clear is that an 11th-hour GOP proposal for a less expensive Vikings stadium that would rely on borrowing instead of gambling is gaining steam.
The resort's pampering quotient has been doubled by expanding the spa with five curtained, thatch-roofed outdoor treatment rooms set in a tropical garden.

Adjacent is a newly equipped fitness center and a 25-meter Olympic-style outdoor pool, one of six.
Carrying guitars, mandolins, tambourines and an ungainly string bass, they led 35 of us away from the center of town, beyond the church of San Diego and the Jardín Unión, over stone bridges, up narrow, dark streets, centuries old, until somewhere near the Alley of the Kiss, in a plaza not much bigger than a family room, they stopped to play.
As for nibbles, instead of the usual samosa pastries and baji fritters, go for "chicken 65," superheated fried chicken nuggets dipped in ground chile batter. Or have egg bonda sitting beside its mint-coconut chutney and a tamarind date sauce. These deep-fried shaggy-crusted orbs look like a delicious Modernist Cuisine experiment.
But, sadly, this may be his last postseason with the Magic. Nelson has a player option for the 2012-13 season that gives him the right to sign a free agent contract elsewhere if he so chooses. He can either opt in with the Magic for one more season and earn about $7.8 million or opt out and test the free-agent market. He will need to make this decision and declare his intentions within a week of the Magic's final playoff game.
NCLC attorneys are co-counsel in a couple of the cases against the banks.
The Pacifica United Soccer Club U12 Silver Division Stingrays played with only 10 players against 11 AJAX and showed their tremendous heart when a cross from Antonia Maguire to Deirdre Heavey resulted in the first Pacifica goal. The Stingrays showed incredible passing skills when center Kyra Noble sent a through ball to forward Briana Sabins who subsequently crossed it to Maquire who then finished off the teamwork with a second blast to the back of the East Bay net. On the other side of the field, defenders Bella Calero and Megan Sicord played tough with sweeper Shelby Willis to keep AJAX at bay. Towards the end of the first half Heavey showed her fancy footwork and dribbled through defenders to make the final goal of the half. Early after halftime, Megan Norr assisted with the fourth goal with an accurate pass to Heavey who kept up the Stingray intensity. Through the relentless heat the Stingrays kept up their own fire with players Angelica Soto, Norr, Noble and Maquire pushing the ball forward while defenders Calero, Sicord and Willis battled in front of the goal. McKenzie Hernandez stepped up as the Stingray goalie and showed a fantastic display of fearlessness with some amazing saves.
Parra's experiences are not unique. Workplace complaints alleging disability discrimination have grown steadily since the economy nosedived. In fiscal 2010, the EEOC fielded a record 25,165 such complaints.

It's an odd week as all four games feature opponents with compelling ongoing story lines. First comes the biggest challenge, a home game against San Antonio, which has the NBA's best record.
The numbers weren’t exactly eye-popping but they came from effective execution that one would expect from a seasoned veteran, not someone who had only seen limited action in blowout victories over Nevada and Missouri State.
Ironically, there (BEG ITAL)was(END ITAL) such a progressive organization until a few years ago -- the Center for Policy Alternatives. Like ALEC, it solicited and distributed legislators' ideas for bills. Its network was mostly Democratic but included middle-of-the-road Republicans (back then less of an endangered species than today). A major effort was to bring the nonprofit and progressive community to meetings of the National Conference of State Legislatures, maintaining a healthy policy balance in debates and contacts there.

My favorite bargain whiskeys? I like both Old Overholt and Rittenhouse Rye (both $14) and even Wild Turkey Rye (about $18). They are great for a Manhattan, old fashioned, Vieux Carre or Sazerac. For bourbon, cheap, hard-to-beat options include Evan Williams ($11) and Ancient Age ($10). But even a good-quality bourbon like Maker's Mark is still only $22, and I know plenty of people who consider Maker's Mark to be pretty close to "top-shelf."

The evening's biggest challenge for the company was Clark Tippet's 1987 "Bruch Violin Concerto No. 1" for four principal couples leading a corps of sixteen men and women, set to Max Bruch's first violin concerto. Tippet's elegant ballet - one of only a handful of ballets he created before his untimely passing in 1992 - meshes a finely tuned sense of classical form with swooping, off-kilter partnering. Quick, precise steps lead organically into athletic lifts with legs angled in decidedly unclassical, yet still aesthetically pleasing shapes.

I thought of that illuminating midnight experience over the weekend, when I read an article about hunger in East Cleveland. It's easy to associate hunger with Haiti or other places devastated by natural disasters or war. But hunger is literally right up the street. Sometimes chronic hunger affects the people standing next to us.

"We have this problem every time new technologies come along. At the moment, we've got a bunch of competing systems," Bridle says. Each system has unique design features, flaws and tricks that take some getting used to — once a reader gets acclimated to Readmill, the features of Kobo Plus may seem baffling.

This is not a matter of government paying for free sex. Those who use contraception practice responsible sex. They take care not to produce children they cannot afford to have. Don't conservatives rail against "welfare queens" who have too many children and fall on the mercy of the state for subsidies and help? Abstinence is fine and dandy, but why preach that only to the poor? The middle class, in an era of declining jobs, difficult health care decisions and rising expenses cannot afford too many children either. Neither can pauperized governments nor can the environment, degraded and depleted, afford a tsunami of new births.
Clark bridged the rebellious new music scene and traditional show business.

Breitbart stumbled in the summer of 2010, when he posted a deceptively edited video purporting to show racist statements by an obscure African American government official named Shirley Sherrod. Sherrod, whose story actually illustrated how she overcame feelings of racism to help a white farmer save his land, was fired. Embarrassed, the Agriculture Department offered her a new job. She sued Breitbart for defamation. (Attorney Michael Rothbert, an expert on media law, said Sherrod could sue his estate.)

As the winners, Andy and Tommy are the first to get the clue to their next destination: Copenhagen, Denmark. Ernie and Cindy and Bill and Cathi are next, followed by Amani and Marcus, Laurence and Zac, and in last place, Jeremy and Sandi. At the airport, most teams opt for the flight to Amsterdam to catch an 8:20 a.m. connection to Copenhagen. Laurence, an experienced world traveler, has decided to instead head to London and hope they can catch an earlier flight and get a few hours lead. When the planes land, most of the teams scramble for a flight that will let them land earlier. Marcus and Amani, however, aren't worried, and are happy on the 8:20 a.m. flight, even taking some un-wind time eating in the airport.

"The thing that's most striking about (the Klasnas) is how they're really pushing for a sense of community," said Heidi Zacher, who runs a farm-to-school educational program for the Black Oak Mines School District.

I made my third visit to Vietnam this decade in August, taking a 19-day Inside Vietnam tour with Overseas Adventure Travel. Instead of making a repeat visit to the old Cu Chi military tunnels during a day in Ho Chi Minh City, I decided to hire an English-speaking guide and driver to take me to the amusement park. At $80, it was a little expensive but worth the adventure.

We have been reading a lot about our school system being so bad. Now, all of a sudden, the Post-Dispatch publishes a 12-page section of straight-A students. The names are so small you can hardly read them, so there must be thousands. I don't understand. When I was a youth, we were lucky to have three or four students on straight A's each semester. It seems to me that the grading system has gone to a feel-good system so that parents don't complain about children being held back or flunking classes. As a result, the children who go to college end up taking remedial courses before they are admitted. It's really troubling.
"American Muslim organizations, jolted by the spate of cases, are abandoning their hesitation to speak out," The Washington Post said. CAIR and the Muslim Public Affairs Council had vowed to launch new "counterradicalization programs aimed at young people."
Carolina selected Stewart in the first round. James, projected to be a second-round, or third-round pick, might have ran himself into being a firm third-round pick.

Madness aside, his cruel edge found traction in the avant-garde of the 20th century and beyond. Nelson sees it in the performance art of Chris Burden (who in 1971 had a friend shoot him in the arm), in the works of young video artist Ryan Trecartin and, again and again, in the paintings and approach of Francis Bacon. She sees it in other places as well, including the writing of Mary Gaitskill and Brian Evenson, the photographs of Abu Ghraib detainees and reality TV.

Just because that's what you're into doesn't mean you can make that sound come out your mouth. The genetics take over and determine whether you can really sound like that, so I probably have more of my mother's voice than my dad's, and it's a bit prettier.

It hardly mattered: in '71, the pair were at the height of their powers, setting trends for singer-songwriters that last to this day. Taylor and King pioneered a new style -- comfortable, stripped-down folk-soul, indebted to Motown but far more relaxed.

Here was the pop star not as distant hero, but as intimate friend and confidante, casual, identifiable, pleasant to hang with.

OK, we haven’t played “Slide” yet, because we can’t quite believe that this is really a thing. But we will be playing it this week. “Slide” seems like some sort of amped-up training regimen for unlocking your iPhone, but maybe there’s something we’re missing here. After all, “Slide” is wildly popular. Or, perhaps the review by Apple user Mneeley18 sums it up best: “don’t bother if you have an IQ higher than a mushroom.”

The current round of violence dates to 1997 with the death of the once-powerful Juárez cartel's leader, Amado Carrillo Fuentes. This created an opening for Joaquín Guzman "El Chapo" Loera, who escaped from prison in a laundry cart in 2001, to move in on the weakened cartel's turf. The following year, Ramon Arellano Felix, chief enforcer for the AFO, was killed and the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels both made a grab for Tijuana. When Gulf cartel leader Osiel Cardenas Guillen was captured in 2003, the Sinaloa cartel sent Los Negros in a bid to take over Gulf territory, setting off violent clashes in Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. These are essentially the battles ranging now in Ciudad Juárez, Tijuana, Reynosa and Nuevo Laredo, but the players are changing.
Unlike TripAdvisor, Expedia, Hotels.com and Priceline all limit their guest reviews to customers who booked hotels through their websites.

The online travel seller identifies reviews on its site as either verified or not, and says all but a few are verified.

I am forever telling my children to try to take the high road. "Think how miserable this person must be inside, to be such a jerk," I've said. Of course, I don't know that this actually true. Maybe some bullies are happy as larks, enjoying the pain they're causing others.

For fans of Tyler, who does not exactly flood the market with her work, this is a special spring: Along with "The Beginner's Goodbye," she also wrote the introduction to "Midstream" (Scribner) by the late Reynolds Price, a new memoir put together from the author's papers after his death in 2011. Price, an extravagantly talented novelist in his own right, was Tyler's teacher during her days as an undergraduate at Duke University.
That should be a lesson not only for presidential candidates but for those in Congress who are negotiating to reduce the nation's deficit. Continued gridlock won't play well with voters whose ire will likely be aimed at the side least willing to give ground. And at the moment, that would be the GOP, whose elected leaders recently offered to "raise" taxes but only under a plan that uses almost all of the resulting revenue to finance a tax cut for the rich.

Matching the locomotives' historicity are Cass' buildings, but with some compromises forced by fire. Though typical of the stations of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway, the main-line railroad that served Cass, the handsome depot from which Cass trains now depart is a replica built in 1975, after the 1923 building burned. The locomotive shops, built at the same time as the depot, burned in 1972 and have been replaced.

As it happens, I've been a teacher for nearly 20 years. A professional. I pay a higher percentage of my salary into the Teachers' Retirement System than any other educated professional (9.4 percent of my salary, mandated by law!). This same law prohibits me from receiving the Social Security benefits I earned in a former career. I likely won't ever be able to retire, and if I do, it won't be until I'm at least 75. I doubt I will ever see the money I contributed into TRS. These paid-out-of-my-own-pocket dollars will be absconded by our elected state Legislature. Yet, according to the Tribune, I'm the source of all Illinoisans' financial woes. Even though I, too, am an Illinois taxpayer, a homeowner, a working professional with a family to feed, stuck in the economic downturn like everyone else. Good luck with that.
I spent many days on that stream with friends. We were young then, and stupid, and 100 percent happy. After we left the Bend for the last time, I doubt any of us were ever as carefree again.

TR was so secure in what he had accomplished, in fact, that he eschewed the honorific "Mr. President" in retirement, preferring instead that everyone address him as "Colonel Roosevelt," the rank he had earned as commander of a volunteer cavalry regiment during the Spanish American War — and the title that Edmund Morris uses for the third and concluding volume of an exemplary biography begun more than three decades ago with "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt," winner in 1980 of a Pulitzer Prize; "Theodore Rex," the 2001 installment, focused on his tenure as 26th president of the United States.

But Newsom can "learn a great deal, establish lots of relationships and make a contribution to the people of California," he said. "The important thing is to enjoy being where you are."
South of Los Angeles and north of San Diego lies an intermittently magical 789-square-mile realm where freeways hum and Disneyland flourishes, where immigrants remake old communities as new ones ripple across the hills. Many outsiders treat this place as they would a prosperous but hopelessly dull relative — the way some Europeans treat Belgium. Let's remember, people, that Belgium has given us centuries of good waffles, beer and chocolate, not to mention the French fry and Jean-Claude Van Damme. So it is, sort of, with O.C.
All these events are covered by The Chronicle's B. G. & Z., also known as Catherine Bigelow, Leah Garchik and Carolyne Zinko.

If the Spurs’ Gregg Popovich wins this award, it’s not wrong. Both coaches, and several others, have done masterful jobs. But since Thibodeau won this award last year, what should change? The Bulls posted the league’s best record for the second straight season. They did so with massive injuries to key players like Derrick Rose, Richard Hamilton and Luol Deng. The Spurs had injuries as well. But this is what sways it in this voter’s eye: With Rose missing 26 games, no Bulls player will land on any of the three All-NBA teams. And yet they still posted the league’s best record.

“He’s definitely damaged his brand, particularly personally. He didn’t make the right strategic decisions in the campaign both in his fundraising strategy and his various impulsive ways of speaking,” Chandler said. “Also, the way he stayed in the race so long, he’s annoyed some of the more powerful establishment-type people in the party, and he’s also taken the steam out of his name.”

But an unusual application process and a small student body aren't what separate it from such established and more conventional advertising programs as the Miami Ad School and the Portfolio Center in Atlanta. Beginning each April and continuing for the next 13 months, the students, each of whom pays $15,000 in tuition, are transformed from neophytes to hardened industry creatives by the iconoclastic Helm, who taught at Virginia Commonwealth University's Adcenter and spent time writing about the waste and seduction of advertising before returning to the Wieden fold. The program's major distinction is its curriculum: There is none. There are no tests, grades or classes.

How unusual? He has a team that examines the defendant's record to determine whether too short a sentence is likely to pose a danger to society or otherwise work an injustice. Just how heinous, for example, were the crimes that made up the first two strikes?

It is a crisp, aromatic wine that tastes of peaches with a hint of grapefruit and mineral. The sémillon tames the herbaceousness of the sauvignon blanc, while the sauvignon blanc lends good acidity.
