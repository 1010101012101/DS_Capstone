My band needs some song suggestions, so pretty much any kind of rock besides screamo is what we're willing to play if you guys can think of anything. We don't have a singer yet though, so nothing too hard because I'd rather not waste 3-4 weeks learning a song that our singer can't sing when we get one.
That's not to say that we don't want to foster children, we do; however, we're ultimately looking for family completion. I've asked our licensing specialist what we should do, keep a bed open, take in kids and wait to see what happens even though that means the kids may have to be moved and he said that it's a decision J and I would have to make ourselves. It's a tough decision.
By nature, many conservatives are placid, compliant, and respectful towards others. For the most part, we are civil, patriotic Americans who simply want to be left alone to be with our families (and yes, Mr. President, our guns and religion). When those on the Left start hurling insults at us, we are typically speechless. We don’t know what to say, and more often than not, we just ignore it. Besides, we know what is right and what is wrong. We don’t feel the need for self-justification. The truth speaks for itself.
It looks just like bread inside! (Apologies for the rather soft focus).
Plot twists are another thing that send up bright green flares in the dead of night. Often, you’ll be able to see different things before they happen, which completely obliterates any hope of a shocking reveal on the author’s part. When the reader reaches that section, he or she just says, “Oh, I knew that,” and goes on, not caring for the main character’s devastated feelings.
What an incredibly sexy and entertaining book. I really, really enjoyed this one. For the last nine years, Miranda has been known as the Boobs of Bluebonnet. Right after graduation, she spent 7 minutes in a closet with Dane and that seven minutes ruined the rest of her life. Someone took photos and posted them on the internet, ruining her reputation and causing her mother’s nervous breakdown. Finally 9 years later, and Miranda‘s mom is finally stable enough again so that she can have her own life. She’s three weeks away from a new career and move to Houston when Dane rolls back into town. He’s starting an outdoor survival school with two of his best friends and she sees this as her opportunity for revenge before she starts her new life.
In the previous post, I wrote about my new math differentiation model.

Several of the men, including lieutenant John Gore and ship’s master Robert Molyneux, had visited Tahiti two years earlier when they sailed there aboard the Dolphin, captained by Samuel Wallis. This was the first time European’s had visited the island and at that time Purea was already estranged from her husband, a chief by the name of Amo.
The ambience of Woodstock is continued in Hanover. The Ivy League originated as an athletic community eight private institutions of higher education in north eastern USA. The eight institutions that make up the Ivy League are Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, Pennsylvania and Yale. The town of Hanover was like a smaller version of Oxford or Cambridge and a very pleasant weekend was had by all. It was made all the better when I was informed of the Arsenal result against Everton as we sat down to dinner in The Canoe Club, a very nice restaurant in town.
A year later, Death Grips are no longer the enigma they once were, but that hasn’t made them any less intriguing. The vocals/battle cries that I remember scaring the bejesus out of me belong to Stefan Burnett, while the production is the work of Zach Hill, the self-taught, human drum machine of math-rock band Hella, and Andy Morin on keys. Recently signed to Epic, the trio dropped their first album The Money Store to wide acclaim, and it’s packed to the brim with crack rock gems. “I’ve Seen Footage” instantly took me back to that moment of first hearing them, and it’s a prime example of how head bobbing and a flight or flight reaction can be melded into the perfect synthesis. The group displays a few influences proudly on this track, with synths reminiscent of Gary Numan, and a muddled sample of what sounds a whole hell of a lot like Salt-n-Pepa’s “Push It” buried beneath Burnett screaming about what he’s seen. And he does not sound happy. For further listening, check out their mixtape free Ex-Military, or pick up a copy of The Money Store.
We were exceptionally prepared, they were not. Their lawyer was a cocky, arrogant little guy, tried to get my goat by bringing up the fact my husband had died on board so therefore that would reduce the value of the boat and tried pretty much everything he had to get his clients, my buyers, their deposit back. All of this of course cost big bucks both for me with my lawyer and what was needed to bring this to discovery, plus their lawyer too. In the end, we didn’t back down and they realized they were not going to win so decided we’d all settle without paying further monies. I was out an additional $8K for legal fees, I’m sure they were out at least that amount or more, but was glad it finally was resolved and over with. Learned a lot going through that legal process too and learned not to be fearful or intimidated by anyone, but it was one helluva expensive lesson – story of my life lol!
Oh to be a Video Nasty, a film so reviled in England that they had the moral majority upchucking their tea. Grouped in with films like The Last House On The Left and Cannibal Holocaust, Nightmare (or Nightmare in a Damaged Brain as it's also known) fits the mold to a "T". The film has seedy sexual encounters, blood, guts and a deranged psycho killer. What more could you ask for?
In a class last night we discussed how if we spent 15 minutes a day reading the Bible that we could read it in a year. My wife can read a novel a day on vacation. Most people I know, including myself, can do it in a few days. We remember every name of every character in a series like Twilight or Harry Potter, but can’t name the disciples. We know every player on our favorite team and know their schedule and even have time for fantasy football, but don’t know how to lead someone to Jesus. We can learn every change on Facebook even though we complain about it and add friends about every day, but we don’t bring anyone to our church all year.
kiss the Summer in between. I performed in my first play. I had crushes on various girls I don’t even remember now. I had some good teachers, and good friends, a cat named Chip and 2 crazy-ass beagle dogs, and generally my life was pretty solid.
I seem to be busy all the time. Taking care of one thing or another, but never going where I think I want to go. Maybe its time to reassess what it is I really do want and where I really want to go. You would think that if I really wanted what I think I want I would be a bit better at getting the right things done, instead of all the wrong things.
OK - start at the beginning of the month so grab a coffee it is a long post!
So that's it....I've decided that, there is no way I'm running around after anyone again. They will be treated the same way as they've treated me from now on. The same goes with Eric...my Hubby....whom I gave my all for 6 months when he had the heart attack. Not one single day as he taken time out......except for a day off to fetch his new van! MEN!!!!
I’ve never dreamed about a wedding. Until now, I didn’t even think about getting married and having kids (because the thought of birthing scares me to hell). But just like every girl I dreamed about wearing something beautiful for my birthday, or my debut (which never happened). I’ve never worn a ball gown. I don’t want to die not having the chance to do just that. I want to be called pretty, not just beautiful (because every one of us is beautiful in different senses and ways). I want to feel special too, even though I always tell people that I don’t give a damn. I do. Just like everyone else.

The "joy" of the site, says Frank, is that when your stars accumulate for a while, "the important stuff is going to inevitably surface." By the "important stuff," he means the "why" that sits between you and your friend. Why are you friends? What do you like about each other? Frank says Facebook has done a good job establishing connections between users and the people, brands and artists they like, but that a friend request or "Like" button doesn't say anything about why that connection exists.Frank, who defines Star.me as "light playspace," says that underneath the fantastical HTML5 graphics is actually "large scale system about identity, relationships and the stuff we appreciate about each other." Naturally, he adds, it's going to be messy.

Other films for me are “Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter”. All I have to say is no. Just…no. Also, the marketing campaign has done a great job for “Snow White and the Huntsman” making it look very stylish. Let’s hope it doesn’t disappoint and fall flat on its face as an average action film. My final film on my list is “G.I. Joe: Retaliation”. Yes, I know the first one wasn’t that good. But, like Snow White, the marketing has been very good. And this looks like it could be a lot of popcorn action flick fun. Besides, The Rock helped save the “Fast and Furious” franchise.

My hubby gained a little weight too. He ate everything he wanted. Bread, potatoes, fried foods etc... but you know what? When he eats my home cooking... he doesn't gain any weight, in fact, when he eats my homemade bread, he LOSES weight, no matter how much of it he eats. There's got to be something to that.

Of all the bolognese sauces I have enjoyed, I suppose the one I make all the time is the one I love most. (And now that we have two children I do sort of feel like I make it all the time.) I’m not sure how authentic it is, but it’s very simple, and very comforting and delicious.

Ok, this one is kinda bad... So, one day in high school I was walking into the building and the girl who drove my carpool told me I had blood stains on the back of my pants. I didn't really know what else to do except untuck my shirt to cover it up. (We had a dress code that required us to tuck our shirts in) I got away with it for my first class, but while I was waiting in the hall to get into my second class, the assistant principal noticed and asked me why my shirt wasn't tucked in. So I'm in his office, explaining to him that the reason I'm not following dress code is because I got my period and it's leaking so I wanted to cover it up. Suuuuper awkward. All he could say was "ummmm.... ok, well don't do it again..." and send me on my way. I don't think I got in trouble after that. Even when I was late for school three times and walked around without a hall pass. I was such a rebel.

Reagan’s supporters were told America could spend its way to prosperity; that we could deregulate big business and it would never create adverse consequences, -ever, because it allowed us to finally say what we felt was a long overdue “fuck you” to the poor. We believed it because it made us feel good. We believed it because it was allowing us to eat all we wanted, without any ill effects… that was the promise and that was the lie.
In the same article, a picture of zucchini fritters caught my eye. The fritter recipe called for exactly twice the amount of zucchini I had in the fridge, twice the eggs, and twice the onion. Perfect! I made the fritters for myself, and began reheating leftovers for the sure-to-be naysayers. You know, of course, that I can't follow a recipe to save my soul, so here's what I did.

And make a recommendation. Would you suggest that the agent read the material herself because you found it that good or do you think it’s not as good as the books we already have on our shelves? Would you recommend that the agent is going to want to read the entire manuscript? Do you want to read the entire manuscript? One thing to consider when making this decision is whether or not you’d be able to sit in our office meeting and comfortably and excitedly recommend to all of us that we read more of this book.

After gas we went through a burned out area of the woods where a forest fire had recently hit. Everything was charred and black and there were cheater lines everywhere. There was a goofy endurocross section with some logs towards the end. Then for the next section came the fun part; the A/B split. My C rider buddies got to peel off while I went through approximately 11 miles of not-so-flowing singletrack. It started off nice and then the trees got tighter, and tighter, and tighter. I had a few good crashes trying to make up time when the trail opened up a bit. I’d get on the gas hard and then clip a tree or swap out and end up in a pile. I broke the knob that keeps my helmet visor from flopping around in one get off.
She shook her head and didn’t stop, not when the man took another step back and not even when he raised his left hand and drew the knife down the palm of his leather glove, cutting into his flesh beneath. Not a trace of pain showed on what she could see of his face. Was he trying to frighten her by showing how strong he was? She was already petrified. He stepped towards her and she redoubled her fight against the men, kicking with all of her might.

I woke up at 6.30am feeling exhausted, thirsty, and having no idea what to wear. This has been a theme recently for morning runs – they start out so cold but warm up quickly. I ended up with a pair of Lululemon crops that I got last summer and had forgotten how comfortable they are, and my Brooks long sleeve. I put on a hoodie, drank a glass of San Pellegrino (fancy!) and ate a Vanilla Honey Stinger Waffle, which is my usual pre-race routine. After wasting some time on Twitter, I headed out to Central Park.

This is not to say that people shouldn’t drink and enjoy these new-wave keg beers, or that the editor of “Opening Times” shouldn’t say that they are available alongside real ales and might be worth trying, but to argue that CAMRA should metamorphose into a “campaign for craft beer” is a misguided and dangerous idea. It plays into the hands of those who advocate a much more narrow, élitist and frankly snobbish approach to beer, and dismiss out of hand anything that has achieved mainstream success amongst non-enthusiasts. They sneer at the “boring brown beers” from brewers such as Shepherd Neame, Wadworth’s and Robinson’s who in the early days of CAMRA were at the heart of what the campaign was all about.

She's not a woman in terms of her physicality... but to me she is female. I'm not even suggesting she's a woman trapped in a man's body, but you know how it is when a person's general outlook belies there actual gender. Honey is like that. I guess I see most people as either male or female and it often has no bearing on their birth sex.

Waterproofs come next, and not word of a lie, my favourite cost me six euros from a Decathlon store in France. It's a brown pertex smock that packs the size of a large sandwich; it's featherlite, windproof and even supposedly breathable - and it's cut like a bin bag which means you can slip it over almost anything. They're available in the UK but any pac-a-mac equivalent will do. Of course, I wouldn't use this as my only waterproof on a full day in the hills with a threatening sky - but for most times, when the worst that happens is you get a bit damp before heading to the caff, I'd pack it in preference to coat that cost fifty times more.

The link between duration and lifetime quantity of drinking and the development of cognitive problems is unclear. Some investigators have proposed that cognitive performance worsens in direct proportion to the severity and duration of alcoholism (6,9). Studies suggest that social drinkers who consume more than 21 drinks per week also fit into this category (6). Other investigators have suggested that cognitive deficits may be detectable only in those alcoholics who have been drinking regularly for 10 years or more (8,10). Long-term, light-to-moderate social drinkers have been found to fall into this category as well, showing cognitive deficits equivalent to those found in detoxified alcoholics (8). Although further research is needed to determine how a person’s pattern of drinking is related to cognitive impairment, some deficits are possible even in people who are not heavy drinkers.

This morning my basket was nearly empty. It has been that way for most of this year as Brad and I have entered that “empty nester” phase when our 4th child left for college in August. It seemed strange at first to have that nearly empty basket, but Brad and I have really enjoyed many of the perks of getting used to just the two of us again. Well guess what, next week, our 2 children that are still in college are heading back home. As I stand in the laundry room I get a little flood of excitement about what the next few weeks will bring. We will have some activity in the house, noise after 10:00 pm, a few extra friends that drop by and raid my pantry, a little bigger grocery bill, a dinner table with a few more plates and a couple of kids that will actually want me to cook, some late night conversations about life, bathrooms with toothpaste on the mirror again, conversations about picking clothes up off the floor, a few more cars in the drive, and yes….all the “stuff” they bring home in bins, bags, and boxes. Do you know what else? My laundry basket will be full again, and I can hardly wait.

But guess what.....it did.
There was too much to look at. Knotted branches. The urgent but senseless angular pointing of the tree limbs. Grass the colour of wafers. Trees lifting soundless explosions of chrome and saffron. Mountains scribbled maroon... However, I felt that such language was inapt for the farming characters who are revealed by the framing handwritten postcards as semi-literate. At one point, just after the murder, Loyal's heightened perception of the landscape was psychologically acceptable - He saw and heard everything with brutal clarity - but the terms in which he sees it didn't seem so: Evening haze rose off the hardwood slopes and blurred a sky discoloured like a stained silk shirt. (As John said: would he ever have even seen a silk shirt, leave alone readily think of one?) I felt, as a result, the chief subjects of the novel were the landscape and the author's appreciation of it, rather than the characters, who simply floated towards their inconsequential fates amongst the fine descriptions.

‎DF: :-) I get a little cranky about it. Didn't we fight a long bitter war in order not to have kings? And now we want them back, because we're too lazy to do some arguing and organizing? Sheesh.
Baby's Got A Gun formed in 1985 in East Kilbride and were noted for the inclusion of Murray Dalglish formerly a drummer with The Jesus And Mary Chain. The following year they moved to Edinburgh where there were more gig opportunities. Jock McDonald of The Bollock Brothers became the band's manager after catching one of their gigs which led to the release of this 12" EP on his MBC label.

However, the writing was fun, and the description of Hell was very vivid. I liked that both Heaven and Hell had a modern element to them. Frannie was snarky and relatable, and even though she's seriously indecisive, and maybe a tad whiney, it was nice reading from her POV.

The other day, on a week day, it was pretty but cold by the evening, so we decided to have a fire, and of course, s’mores. Ah… the beauty of homeschooling. Who doesn’t need s’mores mid-week, right?

Because the most effective sites are inundated with people wanting to advertise on them, many of them are setting up policies where the book to be advertised must have 5 or 10 reviews on Amazon, with an average of 4 or 4.5 stars and/or one of the reviews must be from a recognized review blog, and/or some other criterion designed to throttle submissions. This puts a new work at a disadvantage since many of these sites are booked months in advance and getting legitimate reviews takes time.
You made me feel adored
Based on an original play by the queen of parlor mystery herself, Agatha Christie, the story was expertly adapted by early TV writer Larry Marcus, with the aid of Wilder and successful playwright/screenwriter Harry Kurnitz into a taut, brilliant script that alternates deftly between suspense and intrigue on the one hand, and whimsical comedy and wordplay on the other. It's quite an achievement, made even more impressive, as all movies are, when viewed in its proper setting.
Feel free to offer any alternative suggestions.
Palate: Quite hot. chilies? Yeast, soy sauce, peanut butter, thickened cream. A little water actually makes this hotter. More water again brings out vanilla and cherry blossom.
Once I get started with my scanning and bagging, I’m fairly good at it. I’ve practiced now for a few years. I get into a rhythm. I start passing canned goods and little tubs of yogurt from one hand to the other like a seasoned juggler. One hand scans, the other bags. I even have a couple of produce code numbers memorized. That’s right. I can’t remember my family’s phone numbers because they’re in my cell phone, but I can recall that the banana code is 4011 (Which, strangely enough, is also the number you call for information about produce).
He again incarnated as Sri Aurobindo on August 15,1872 to further his work to help create the New Race on the Planet. This time he left leaving his dynamically charged body for the benefit of the Planet and its inhabitants on December 5, 1950.
“Labels have nothing to do with what I remember.” I said softly “I have them so they remember their place.” The tour was over so I walked her to the front door and thanked her for visiting. She looked at me with wide eyes and her mouth hung open, but she picked up her bag and left without another word. My sister has curly hair that bounces when she walks. I don’t like my sister. She never calls.

There are, apparently, some real "greats" in the world of yaoi, mangakas who have dedicated followings for the very good reason that they have exceptional stories, characters, humor, or, yes, hotness. One of them is Naono Bohra who ups the bar on creativity and making sympathetic characters to a level I've never seen in any other mangaka's work, nor prose and poetry either.
“I Stand with Planned Parenthood because they have been there for me and now I want to be there for them, and for all the women whose lives were saved because of the very important work they do,” said political satirist and author Lizz Winstead.
My husband is cross with me. On this occasion, unusually, he could actually be right. It really was a stupid conversation to get into. I mean, if you were being driven across London, hot-bed of religious retribution, in a black Mercedes mini-cab, by a total stanger (as mini-cab drivers usually are) would you get into a conversation about religion?
We have some magnificent capabilities to see detail in deep shadows while focused on well-lit objects. It is in fact this ability that I find most fascinating, because I have tried to figure out whether I had looked into the shadows subconsciously noting the detail or if I am seeing that wide a spectrum of detail. In either case, the ability to see the wide range of detail in light or shade is a characteristic that I have not yet found innate within a camera, but I find it most common in creatively thinking people.
How can cosmic religious feeling be communicated from one person to another, if it can give rise to no definite notion of a God and no theology? In my view, it is the most important function of art and science to awaken this feeling and keep it alive in those who are receptive to it.
Today someone told me something I want to never forget - “It doesn’t bother me when I say I love you. You are a friend and very important to me. Who is more important to me, you or the people standing around me judging my feelings? I want you to know I love you every minute of the day. That’s it. Period.”
Way back when, I signed up with MySpace to keep in contact with people I didn’t see any more. Then I did the same with Facebook. I signed up with Google+ just because it was new and different. Since then, I’ve forgotten my password and email account for MySpace so I don’t think I’ll be going back there. Not any time soon. So I’ll just concentrate on Facebook and Google+ for now.

Proponents of the charter assured the audience that they were members of the community, some for as long as five years, and had a right to demand excellence and choice. One or two mentioned the high cost of private school as a reason for their support of charters. Some of their comments caused hoots of derision from the audience. A few times the Chair had to call for quiet and a quality audience. At one point an irate individual was removed from the building by the security for swearing at speakers.
However, another individual, the expert bomb-maker who came up with this tactic survived a similar missile attack last year. Counterterrorism agencies believe he is still engaged in active plotting against US and other Western targets.

No master chef has ever presented a dish that looked like it sat under a U-lock and a stack of books, so why should your lunch look that way? Stave off the embarrassing effects of sandwich squishing and cookie crushing using fabulous ziploc containers. Never again will your nectarine be prematurely tenderized, nor will your kumquat come squashed.
Then the pièce de résistance: the montanara. First of all, the pizza was smaller than I was expecting. Second, though, this did not mean it was any less satisfying. The dough was a study in contrasts: fried, but not greasy; crunchy, but not thin; thick, but not dense. The tomato sauce had a touch of sweetness, and I loved the smoked mozzarella — it really added another dimension to the pizza. I had exactly half of the pizza and half of the caprese, and saved the rest for the next day’s lunch. I’m happy to report it held up quite well and was very good even a day later.

So naturally, living in Ontario, Canada the first thing that came to my mind was a winter getaway because the best way to get out of the cold is well, to literally get out of the cold and travel to a hot tropical desination.

fly to Geneva, Switzerland, and travel around while on Christmas break. Her flight from Geneva to Paris to Pittsburgh was to take place yesterday. So, with snow in the forecast, she had to travel from her small village, Louhans, by train to Geneva. Well, she didn’t want the trains to not run and miss her flight, so she left 2 days early and stayed in a hostel for two nights.

I think part of me must already be going through that dratted S.A.D. or something because this week, I have just felt so rotten and grumpy. I thought, Maybe I need to work myself into a Christmassy fervor! So, my plan was to make a post about awesome Christmas wreathes I found on Etsy.com. I even found five I liked! However, after today, a real doozie of a day, I decided to see if there were any "Christmas Monster" things on Etsy. Sure enough, there were! So with my Zombie Christmas Cards and now Christmas Monsters, I seem to be inadvertently changing general feel and meaning of December to be The Month of the Monster. Really, this isn't intentional. It just seems to be working out that way...
For so long I bought into my own theory that I had screwed up my metabolism so badly with all the yo-yo dieting that my body refused to lose weight. And while I’m sure that age and rollercoaster weight loss hasn’t helped my already-slow metabolism, it was a cop out for me to think that I “couldn’t” lose weight. And when the nutritionist told me that the only one stopping me from losing weight was me, she was right. Which also means that I’m the one that has control over my own weight loss.
Saskia has leapt up off the floor and gone over to the sluice room where she jerks the light cord on and off. There are groans of protest from the curtained bed spaces just across the way. The nurse grimaces at me and then goes over to her.
Ok, start by making a fresh salad. Yesterday I used fresh spring greens, the Spring Mix, from Wal-Mart. Any lettuce mix will do. I added vine-ripe tomatoes, matchstick carrots, sliced yellow bell pepper, cucumber slices, and Vidalia onions (because when the Vidalias are in season I tend to use them in everything!) and grated cheddar cheese. As this is the main dish, I made a good-sized bowl for the two of us. (And true to form for me, I had leftovers.)

Mattias and the crew had congregated on the quarter deck to devise a plan. In all honesty the situation looked bleak, much worse than Stacey could have guessed. They were out manned, and had been caught by surprise. Mattias had been in tight spots before, but even he couldn't see a way out of this one, and the crew could see it on his face. The other ship's men were already boarding, which meant that he couldn't place his men in any strategic way, they were on the quarter deck, and that's where they would make their stand. He also couldn't have them try to run, because there weren't enough men to fight who had boarded AND get the ship going.

Measure out two equals scoops of the molding product. Amazing Mold Putty comes in Part A and Part B. Usually the two parts are different colors and you knead them together until a consistent color is reached. I work in small quantities since the molding material tends to set up rather quickly. If you mix too much it will set before you can work with it all. I have also discovered through trial and error that trying to push an object into a large blob of the molding material creates a blurred/multiplied image.
Tonight I needed a good run to beat me up and get rid of the stress of the day. I played hockey last night so I was a little stiff and sore. My back hurts the most after a night of hockey. So after running the trails in the local park on Tuesday and playing hockey last night my body wasn’t really ready to start running.
'Fracking' is the catch-cry!
Back in April after yet another sleepless Saturday night, courtesy of the neighbour's barking dog, we were seriously considering moving house. I know that you will be thinking they must be mad. They haven't finished the cottage that they are currently living in. But the brain plays tricks on you when you are wide awake at 3am in the morning. We had seen for sale, in the village, a house which interested us. At present we live on the outskirts of the village. Even though there is nothing more than a post box and a phone box in the centre of the village I have hankered after living in the village, ever since we moved here. The post office and a little shop went a long time ago. At the time that we moved here the cottage that we bought was the only suitable property available. It is not very often that a house in the village is for sale. Most of the houses are too big for us and in all the seven years that we have lived here, this is the first house that ticked the right boxes for us. It wasn't perfect. It needed work doing to it. Neither of us really wanted a return to living in a building site but what is the price of a good night's sleep?

Let's face it; we like the sweetness of the sauces because the corn syrup hits our blood stream and shoots right to our brains. And the MSG heightens all of the flavors in much the same manner so we just want to eat everything on the table in a crazy hurry because it just tastes so darn good. At least, that was the problem for me. I'm sure there are more issues with ingredients (not the least of which are quality and origin), but those two seem to be the triggers for me.

I can also see the extremes of decisions (as people see fit) when someone just decides to leave everything behind and take a walk, or travel the world. Maybe my saw needs that type of sharpening, a get away from reality and a fresh start. I feel as if sitting somewhere peaceful and quiet is too easy and I can simply flip the page and back to reality, or turn of a key. It needs to get to a point of anxiety as well, the feeling of being trapped and having no choice and forced to see what is in front of me.
So the question is – do I know the way?
If you believe you can, you can! Simple as that. It might take some time to work up your stamina to where you want to be, but you’ll get there. I am proud to say that I have now completed Week 6 Day 2 of the couch to 5K program. At the end of week 5 I ran for a total of 20 minutes…..which ended up being 2.27 miles. I am feeling good. I try not to think about the workout to much, just do what the program says.

But America is not the only multicultural or multiracial society. There are scores throughout the world, and the truth is that most of them handle race a lot better than America does. For example, Switzerland with four separate languages is clearly a multicultural country, but there the different cultural groups can deal with their differences and common interests without claiming that Romansch, German, French, or Italian are “social constructs” or resorting to stupid platitudes about the content of each man’s character.

I worked in my bedroom all day and left the dogs both free ranging it because we haven't had any problems, but when I went downstairs in preparation to pick up the kids I found a fairly good-sized pool of pee (THE BOXER), but I wasn't mad instead I felt bad because clearly it was my fault for not paying attention and letting her out...blah blah blah...I proceeded towards the papertowels only to glance into the dining room to see two small pools of pee (PUPPY PEE)...so I am thinking to myself or maybe even talking out loud to the voices in my head, "Dang, they both had to go out! BAD MOMMY!!" So, I headed towards the two smaller pools of pee, but when I got to them I found an entire minefield of pee puddles!!! Some of the pools were bigger (BOXER)some were just barely puddles (PUPPY). WTF??? Thankfully, we have hardwood floors. Needless to say both are in the doghouse today. Figuratively of course! Puppy is now confined to my bedroom with me while kitty is freerange for the first time in 3 weeks. I have switched to a babygate as my newest attempt to continue separating and acclimating the two...and the BOXER? What BOXER?? Just kidding...she's still here too.
This beer just keeps getting better. The malt and hops are well balanced with mid range mouth feel. Hints of sharp caramel malts, maybe the use of Cara-Vienna malt? Light Stone fruits come through.. Apricot? Juicy fruits with with lots of elegant herbal hop notes. A slight pepper prickle on the tongue follows the herbs from the hops. Some coriander spice and maybe some Belgian Candi sugar sweetness.

On 22 June 1990, the original defendant, Secretary Factoran, Jr., filed a Motion to Dismiss the complaint based on two (2) grounds, namely: (1) the plaintiffs have no cause of action against him and (2) the issue raised by the plaintiffs is a political question which properly pertains to the legislative or executive branches of Government. In their 12 July 1990 Opposition to the Motion, the petitioners maintain that (1) the complaint shows a clear and unmistakable cause of action, (2) the motion is dilatory and (3) the action presents a justiciable question as it involves the defendant’s abuse of discretion.

You can understand why its easy to feel like a millionare over here. We're constantly whipping out a few thousand euros and spending it on a drink of coke. Three cokes is the same as all the money a teacher would have to feed and cloth his family for an entire month. After the tour of the village, we returned to our hotel on the hill and felt all the more grateful for our comfortable beds and banana flavoured food.

What happens though with the people coming into our area for the first time, or have only been here a few times? I did a number of searches on the internet, and the information to help these people plan their vacations to our resort towns are scattered across dozens of web sites, and the information is as varied as the business in our are. Even the “visitor guides” that the chambers for the towns put out do not encompass all of the businesses, primarily because they are based upon chamber membership and paid spots.

My husband's family used to breed them and we read that they are great dogs. Protectors, hunters, great with children and other dogs. We thought this breed would be perfect. And we wanted a rescue. Well upon contacting the Rescues in Texas (there are 4) and Oklahoma, everyone refused to let us adopt because we were considering having children. They all claim that all the dogs returned to them have nipped at kids when they aren't left alone and can need their space. Um, hello, that's every dog I know. Plus we wouldn't let our children terrorize our dogs! We would be better parents then that. So we were unanimously denied. Our hearts broke. We had our hopes set on these little snowy angels and all 7 of the shelters wouldn't even give us a chance.
Miscellaneous light reading around the edges: Tobias Buckell's Arctic Rising; Garth Nix's Sir Hereward and Mister Fitz; and an exceptionally charming self-published novel by a talented newcomer whose book I came across because I fell for his wife's triathlon training blog last year when she and I were both training for Ironman Coeur d'Alene. (She successfully completed the race; alas, I didn't make it to the start due to a particularly bad bout of bronchitis.) So, strongly recommended: M. H. Van Keuren's Rhubarb. I think comparisons of a book in this sort of vein (aliens, paranormal radio, pie!) will inevitably be first of all to Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker books; there's a little bit of the feel of the appealing TV series Supernatural; but really it's a very fresh and appealing novel in a mode I especially enjoy.

I know it's been a while since I've been in touch. I've not had any access to the internet for the last week. I am currently staying at French Tony's house and he doesn't believe in the internet. It's not that he doesn't believe in using the internet, or that he's morally opposed to it. No, it turns out that Tony literally does not believe that the internet exists. I bought a laptop and tried to sneak it into the house but he found it and buried it somewhere in the garden.

The author of the song was a protestant minister and wanted to high light acts of charity rather than, say, Eucharistic Adoration, so he changed the story around.

This week, Roxy is put under even more stress to be a good officer’s wife when the FRG leader quits and storms out of a meeting and Denise makes the suggestion that Roxy should become the leader because it will make her more respected with the other wifes.
So on day one of this reset I poured over my recipe binder, cookbooks and my favourite food blogs for dishes I can enjoy and there are tons! I am actually really excited about the next few days – I plan to try out numerous recipes and a few old favourites and with all the cooking and eating I plan to do, I think this week will just whiz by (something very easy to say on day one)!
The Keep is owned by the City Council, who lease it to the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne, who manage it as a visitor attraction. The society is based in the Blackgate, and use it to house a library and as a meeting place.
We don’t want the overly nice sensitive schlub that goes out of his way to woo us (especially if we are not feeling him) and we also don’t want the jerk that is aloof and overly arrogant. Women want a man that is confident and knows the right boundaries when it comes to pursuing us and keeping us attracted. The minute a man loses himself trying to get one woman – it signals to us in some way desperation or low self-value.
Súsan Klara is moving to JT’s preschool, which is very exciting. Well, not that she realizes it yet, really- but she’s been very talkative with the teachers when picking up her big brother. I have been happy to get in the longer walks to her current preschool, but I´ll admit that it will be easier to walk them both to the same place.

If the word “epic” swept through teenage America last year like the plague, “legit” is this year’s H1N1, and mutant strands keep appearing. For example, “legitly” is now a common adverb used by most teens. Apparently legitimately is too long and offends their abbreviation-oriented brains. The term “Seems Legit” is now the sarcastic caption of a thousand satirical 9Gag photos, pointing out the obvious lack of credibility in everything from Justin Bieber to an autographed copy of the Bible. As a joke or form of satire, I find “legit” an acceptable term to use. It is after all a part of the current pop culture’s jargon. However, if I ever hear “Isaac Newton’s principles were so legit!” ever again I will go on strike against my generation.
A personal favourite (and round the corner from my flat) is the restaurant Tushita (translation: place of contentment). The coffee is good, the food mediocre; but its traditional Brahmastanam architectural structure is uplifting and spacious, with plenty of cool corners to hide in, and free wi-fi. The real heart of Tushita is "Dai," a senior Newar gentleman unfailingly atted in flawless topi-daura-surwal, who performs Buddhist pujas daily in the lower courtyard. Tushita also has an unadvertised, small guest house with a loyal following in the garden behind the restaurant.
I found this old tree while driving some backroads for the first time. I wanted to get closer because it was even cooler in person. Unfortunately, there was barbed wire and a fence protecting this private property. Being that this was in a more rural area, I didn’t want to risk hopping the fence. These are the kind of folks that shoot first and ask questions later.

When the keel of NORTH CAROLINA was laid in October of 1937, she was the first battleship to be constructed in sixteen years. She became the first of ten fast battleships to join American fleet in World War II. NORTH CAROLINA (BB 55) and her sister ship, WASHINGTON (BB 56), comprised the NORTH CAROLINA Class. Following them were the SOUTH DAKOTA Class – SOUTH DAKOTA (BB 57), INDIANA (BB 58), MASSACHUSETTS (BB 59), and ALABAMA (BB 60) – and the IOWA Class - IOWA (BB 61), NEW JERSEY (BB 62), MISSOURI (BB 63), and WISCONSIN (BB 64).

I am a zombie after the time change. You could light my hair on fire, and I would just take my good old time throwing water on myself to put the fire out. I am worthless. Don’t tell me it’s on in my head, either, because I will have to harm you. It’s real and it has been happening to me for years and years.
The music performed by Miles Davis today has undeniably evolved from that labeled “jazz,” which New Orleans pioneers played sixty years ago, but there are other elements contained in it, too, and if Miles’ music is jazz, then so is Stravinsky’s Ragtime for Twelve Instruments. He himself feels that jazz is “a white man’s word” whose application to his music is tantamount to calling a black person “nigger.” Accordingly, though he still must give performances in noisy, Smoke-filled night clubs, Miles approaches his work with the dignity it deserves.
It's not meant to be a nuisance
The ending though is a little (almost negligible) weird.

So my issue is that I’m easily discouraged. There’s no fix for that, is there? You can’t really advise someone on how not to be discouraged about their writing. Either you trust your skills or you don’t. Maybe I need to attend a conference on self-esteem boosts for writers. Would that help?

“Et,” the middle word, is the first and last letter of the Hebrew alphabet combined into a single word. For the Messianic, who usually finds the end of Revelation does well to modify the beginning of Genesis, it is interesting Yeshua (Jesus) declares He is, “… the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.”
To be honest, I was totally pulled by Minho that’s why I watched this show in the first place. But it taught me to open up and accept this JEON-PARK pairing and learned to accept another kdrama couple that made me feel that love is really best felt when shared. Yes, Personal Taste is one typical Kdrama romantic-comedy with few recycled scenes. This series had great moments and failed in some. The potential of the story hit the wrong note towards the end. Personal Taste could have been one of the best out there since the cast were so talented. Sad, the writers and directors somehow were not able to use Lee Min Ho and Son Ye Jin to the fullest. Despite that, I like that this series does not have too much angst like usual. Since sometimes it drags the story line towards a heavy note, too much to bear for my taste. I laughed in most scenes here. That’s why despite the plot, I still enjoyed Personal Taste. Who wouldn’t, Lee Min Ho appears on MY SCREEN!!

70 min: Lots of you are unhappy with the Mikel challenge that led to Tioté’s injury. Here’s a sample mail, from Chuck Schick. “It looks like Mikel will be facing a retrospective ban for that. Will it happen before the cup final? Perhaps, had the referee done his job and punished Tiote for the first incident, Mikel may not have been in the mood for revenge. The Newcastle player could well have got sent off for what looked a deliberate forearm smash to the Nigerian stroller.”

Feb 23 Pre-ASEAN Long Quiz (final quiz of the year)
Yes, yes, my pet. We were too happy before we began playin’ with the nigger. Lucky knew somethin’ would happen to him when he got home. I understood but listen he shouldn’t have been trusted with his paycheck, while you knew he’d spend it all when he got a chance. Honestly I tried to intercept, pull him back, but I couldn’t stop him, and I know, Lucky, he tried his best, but he just couldn’t. Listen, next year you should be forewarned. Gotta keep us away from dunkin’ the nigger. We was like all those out there, you included and some others who kaint always be expected to control our urges. Of course, dear, I’m ashamed of myself for him (let me clear my throat) for us spendin’ so much of our hard-earned dough, which we’re sorry for now. And we spent the biggest part of it on what? Corn dogs, Frito Pie, almost naked women, and dunkin’ a nigger. Well, it was just money. All the same, listen, Lucky, I don’t in no way blame you ‘cause I was as much to blame as you was. We was just talking about money. There are more important things in life than money, more important things like home and family and you know between us we all know it, that’s the beauty of it, see, we know what’s important in life. It’s perfectly priceless our families. And, listen, now that we’re on the subject, what upset our wives more…most was our Sunday love affair with the Green Bay Packers, and of course, we never made a big deal about it, only on Sundays, and please kindly remember, and never forget that we worked hard all week long.. Ahim. And that was the stupidest thing for ‘em to get upset about…us wantin’ to relax on Sundays with the Green Bay Packers. It was the one thing we shared with our sons. It was the one place where the color of a guy’s skin didn’t matter. Women just don’t understand (you know, dicey). So she thought she’d go crazy, speak of it, and we didn’t hear her. A new Westinghouse mixer would’ve gained us a few points. We could’ve used a few. Let us spend money on them. Harbor no more ill will, Molly. And cease your fummin’ Charlotte. Yes, em, life is too short. We was like most men. We liked our beer and our football. Besides you’ve got your house. Let us have our football.
Although I have never been called to somebody’s deathbed to listen to his or her last words, I am absolutely certain that nobody ever died thinking:
At such times, we can either let the Lord Jesus turn our painful experience into a pearl, or we can become embittered and blame others, including God. In the latter case, the wound never heals. As Hebrews says, bitterness will spring up within you and defile many (12:15).

SO COLD THE RIVER would be my favourite because it represented more of a leap for me. I’d obviously written in the traditional detective novel fashion for the first five books, and going into the supernatural thriller realm was not something I really anticipated doing. And maybe because of that, it was an immeasurably fun book to write, so I’d pick that at this point.

With the celebration of Thanksgiving this past week comes the realization that the Holiday Season is upon us. If it has not already taken place in your life, we will all soon be caught up in the frantic pace leading up to Christ’s birth and Christmas. I want very much this year for our lives to be marked by the generosity of Jesus Christ. I do not like the “Bah Humbug” attitude that restricts my spirit from generously blessing those around me; thoughts like, “Hang on to what you have because the times are tough.” Webster’s defines generosity as “marked by abundance or ample proportions.” What I have in my own life that releases my generous spirit is gratitude and being thankful for who Christ is and what He has done for me. In light of that, I am thankful and grateful; it is easy for me to become more generous.

Mobile payments are not limited to card readers though. Perhaps you’ve seen the app from Starbucks that lets you use your phone as a method of payment. The app is pretty simple, it puts an image of a barcode on your phone that is tied to your account. It’s fantastic! You might think I’m over-hyping things a bit, but it’s easier and faster than swiping a credit card. But I’ve been wondering just how much Starbucks is actually processing. According to this post the answer is $42 million in the last 15 months. A rather old stat I saw said that the average spend was over $6 per visit. That’s roughly 7 million transactions. Let that steep for a few minutes.
I’d been a little preoccupied for the last several hours, what with all the pain and breathing and all the thing's that go along with it.

If you compare another popular discount, the "Room Only Discount," to Free Dining then you'll see where Free Dining truly isn't as amazing as Disney (and uneducated WDW guests) think that it is. I'm not gonna break down the math for you because it's sort of boring for most of you who don't enjoy the nerdy mathematical stuff like me. What I can tell you though is that if you're staying at a value resort and participate in FD then you are probably getting a good deal. Even if you upgrade your Free Dining Plan to the "Basic Dining Plan" for a small additional fee. Moderate resorts are sort of hazy but most of the time it's still a good deal as long as you can maximize the Basic Dining Plan fully.
My goal was to evaluate the items in the collection, and present my supervisor with a list of titles that would weed the Teen Graphic Novels by 20%. The South Central Library System had just migrated all records to the Koha ILS a few months before; the transition was bumpy (to say the least!) and collecting circulation statistics was not easy: instead of simply requesting a stats document, I had to scan each item and collect the circ stats manually!

Not only that, but both athletes have a history of competing indoors. Liu won World Indoor gold in '04 & 08 and has an indoor best of 7.42 over the 60 meter barriers. To his credit, Robles won Indoor silver in '06 and is #2 all time indoors at 7.33. With both looking to regain form and potentially get a jump on the outdoor season, fans may not have long to wait to see these two super hurdlers in action.

While children often have to learn about the myths in school, Coats reminds us that the Greek myths were part of everyday life for Ancient Greeks which the children and adults would have learned from storytellers and during visits to their local temples. “They would also have learned the myths through theatre, which was very much a part of their lives.”

To support this claim, I would suggest that one of the symptoms of the rise of ‘fratriarchy’ is that a lot of the role of maintaining order is taken away from the family (and from religious institutions), and given to the state (and, later on, the media). For example, families in developed countries have, over the 20th century, progressively lost more and more of their right to use violence.
The great Traction City is hunting, hungry to dismember and recycle its doomed prey. In the attack, a boy is flung from the speeding superstructure, along with a murderous, scar-faced girl. Tom and Hester must run for their lives through the devastated wastes of the Out-Country as a terrifying new weapon threatens the future of their dangerous, dazzling world.
I think about life without faith and I can see why so many run to relationships, addictions, and unhealthy things. When we are hurting we naturally run to something to find peace, or numbness, or to escape the pain. I have not always run to God in those moments but I learned very young that running elsewhere would only jeopardize my fragile heart even more. When my eyes have gotton lost on other things, I have had to fix my eyes on Him and re-steer my direction. But my faith has never been shaken.
Well, I chose the "texture it" challenge. I LOVE texture. I added texture with my hand-dyed seam binding, the brad, and my sewing machine. I always seem to use my Making Memories distressing tool for texture so I stayed away from it this time. LOL! The ODBD stamp set I used is called Peace & Joy. And to get my brad the exact color I wanted, I used my Copic marker to color the "bling." Works perfectly! Papers: Basic Grey Jovial, Paper Trey Ink cs
I’m back in touch with my mum after not speaking with her for a year and nine months. Since my breakdown started. It’s weird, she’s weird. She just sent me an email like nothing ever happened between us, like we’ve been in touch regularly and everything is fine diddly dine. If I let her back in my life then I know I’ve got to be prepared for the fall of it all again. She comes and goes. But this was the longest time we didn’t speak for and the only reason we are now back in touch is because my sister emailed her to tell her that she’d given birth to a baby girl, then our mum wrote back some long-ass email about herself and the marriage with our dad and how it was and all that jazz. Then sent another email in which she stated she was ‘indulging’ in writing this email to us, and again, just talked about herself and didn’t talk about the relationship between us and her. She included my name in to the email and said it was for me too, so that’s when I decided to reply to her. Now I’m stuck in it with her again, but I really can’t be naive this time and think she’s going to stick around for long or before something bad happens between us. She always wants to get more involved all of a sudden which doesn’t work with me. Like she said in the email that she can be there for me financially and physically. I would now neither accept money from her, neither would I want her to fly here to visit me. So I don’t know where the relationship can go because I don’t think that I ever want to see her again in my life. These emails are just fake shit.
None-the-less, I hope my information is fun, helps make your life easier, gives you confidence or simply encourages.

SOPA explicitly states that companies will be liable for everything their users post.

The rapid development of the mine in 1847 led to a housing shortage for mining families. So the miners excavated dugouts in the steep banks of the creek. They stretched for 3 miles along the creek, housing 1800 people. One third of them children. Due to poor sanitation, disease and floods, they were forced to move into company supplied housing in 1870. There are only a few dugouts left today.
As the candidates are announced, I will definitely keep track of their platforms and offer commentary on their strengths and weaknesses as they role out. I will also be trying to find out as much as I can about their past political experiences; their individual track records; their political stance and where they stand on specific issues that matter to me, my family, community and Nation. It is my belief that we as First Nations people should all have a vote as to who will be the AFN NC. However, even though I am not permitted to vote, I will still try to have an impact on the results. I think we all have the power to make this election different.

What happens when there is NOT a new story like this for the media to feast upon? Instead of traveling to another state, or country, they’ll travel back in time.

From a Western perspective, the environment in Afghanistan in 2018 will probably be much more of a messy and unpleasant compromise than is contemplated now. Much of this will be as a result of downsizing and withdrawal of international troops around 2010–2014. The overall situation is likely to be a similar, but less intensive, version of mid-1990s Afghanistan–‘civil war-lite’? The UN and the international community will be attempting to provide support for a central government that remains divided by personal, local and factional politics. The scale of international commitment, both financially and militarily, will be significantly lower than that of 2008.

Less than a week ago, I went to Michigan to visit him. It was the most fun that I had experienced in an exceptionally long, long time. I needed that…my soul needed that and he nurtured my being. We took turns cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner during my visit and whoever cooked, the other washed the dishes. And as I dutifully took note of this each time, I was thankful and genuinely moved. This is how a partnership, relationship, or marriage should work—a team.
Tyler's mom wanted Greenleigh and Skyler to spend the night Friday, so Tyler and I got to have a date night on Friday. It consisted of calling in a pizza and spending the night on the couch watching The Rum Diary. I usually cook dinner, so the pizza was a nice switch-up. The Rum Diary was weird- good, but weird. I think I would've liked it better if I hadn't seen Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas before I watched it, because the entire movie just reminded me of how much I don't understand that type of humor. Tyler, on the other hand, loved it. Go figure.

“Not one of the angels could have become surety for the human race: their life is God’s; they could not surrender it. The angels all wear the yoke of obedience. They are the appointed messengers of Him who is the Commander of all heaven. But Christ is equal with God, infinite and omnipotent. He could pay the ransom for man’s freedom. He is the eternal self-existing Son, on whom no yoke had come; and when God asked, ‘Whom shall I send?’ He could reply, ‘Here am I; send Me.’ He could pledge Himself to become man’s surety; for He could say that which the highest angel could not say—I have power over My own life, ‘power to lay it down, and… power to take it again.’” Youth Instructor, June 21, 1900. 5BC 1136
No. 55 RK Motors Toyota driver Brian Vickers started sixth and finished 18th in Sunday’s 515-lap NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race at Martinsville Speedway. Vickers started on the outside of row three, but dropped to 28th before he could move from the outside to the inside lane. Unfortunately, track position is key at Martinsville Speedway and the Thomasville, N.C., native spent the rest of the race fighting to stay on the lead lap. He lost a lap on lap 202 then regained it when he took the wave around on lap 360. A pit stop for gas with about 50 laps remaining cost him two laps he never made up. The No. 55 team returns to action Saturday, April 14th at Texas Motor Speedway with Mark Martin behind the wheel. Vickers next appearance in the No. 55 is June 24 at Infineon Raceway.

On December 8, 2010, Loughner auditioned for the part of Uncle Fester in the upcoming Addams Family Vacation musical, which is scheduled to open on Broadway in May of this year. "I was totally right for the part," said Loughner from his cell in Pima County, Arizona. "Shaved head, crazy eyes, the whole thing. I even have the voice down." Loughner then did several impressions of Uncle Fester's voice. "See, I'm really good!"
It is impressive.
It's a bit different this time as I did not color my image! I just stamped it onto yellow cardstock using Versamark ink and then embossed it with super fine detailed black embossing powder. A little dry embossing for a border, some punched out small butterflies a few pearls and some Stickles 'Stardust' to finish it up. I did not add a sentiment so I can use it for different occasions. This card was quickly made and can also be easily mass produced for invitations, thank you cards, etc.
But from what I understand and am experiencing, NaNoWriMo has nothing to do with critics, publishing, profits, shareholders, mergers or best sellers lists or anything that gives or takes credibility from any of these things listed above. For me it's purely about a community of people, writers mostly, who get a chance to participate in something they love to do most with others who feel the same. Writing! So maybe I'm missing the boat on this one, or I'm just over simplifying it. But for me, the only objective I have in doing NaNo is simply to do something I love to do. Write.

The music, composed by Koji Endo, works in concert with what happens on screen. Throughout the film simple playful melodies are used, the audition scene featuring lively score. When the film becomes darker the music ceases to be playful and quaint and as Yoshikawa’s world falls apart the familiar melodies become increasingly discordant.
When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him. And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily so that the ropes that were on his arms were as flax that is burned with fire, and his bonds dropped from his hands.
I admit that I am not a scientist, but I do not believe that this works in the real world. You might be able to build a hypothetical computer model in which a fish develops into a lizard through mutations and inbreeding, but in real life inbreeding easily does so much damage to the species that it outweighs the possible advantage that could be attained by the “good” mutation. A lot of “bad” mutations will come to light as a result of the inbreeding as well, and this will make the inbred offspring less likely to survive natural selection than the rest of their species.
Calcium and vitamin D aren't the only nutrients your bones need. Magnesium contributes to bone strength; vitamin K may help protect against hip fractures; and zinc, copper, and manganese all are needed for proper bone formation.
It’s Friday night here. It’s very quite now. I kind of like spending Friday night at home relaxing. Am I getting old or what? I no longer have an urge to go out at night on Friday night. It’s a luxury to have a quiet night when I can do anything. I can read a book (ah, I haven’t done it in a while) or magazines, watch a movie or TV, read blogs, edit photos or blog. This is true bliss.
There are more bokeh shots that I uploaded, but most of them didn’t really have any meaning at all. However, playing with light (or painting it) will really help you figure out what a photo means.
Dramatically, I am so different personality wise now to how I was prior to diagnosis. I resented my body for causing this chronic illness, for making me need life saving surgery to remove bowel. I have, and some may be a little shocked here, become a lot more reserved. I am not as outgoing as I used to be. I have found, due to steroids making me put on 3-4stone, I have lost my confidence too. I do not consider myself as attractive any more, I used to like what I saw in the mirror you know? I have also, thanks to oral Morphine (oramorph – a syrup containing strong opiate painkillers), lost a couple of teeth. I am a shadow of my former self, personality wise. Privately I worry I will never find someone to love me and not be frightened of my illnesses various. I mean, who would want a 12 stone scarred and toothless woman? Not many am sure.

I fell in love with many men as a young woman. Most were musicians and each has his special place in my heart. The wall posters and my subscriptions to 16 and Tiger Beat, along with various other music fan mags of the 70s are long gone, but I poured through them in my bedroom back then, reading every article, savoring every gem I could unearth.

Due to the killer combination of excellent ingredients, authentic but exciting recipes, a charming host, an intimate setting with a scarcity of seats and a more-than-reasonable price tag, understandably it's rather difficult to snag a table at La Tête dans les Olives (you'll need to book three months in advance). You can, however, pop into the shop whenever you like for a quick olive-oil-and-Sicilian-charm fix...

“Owain was only a young man, and it was totally unnecessary for anyone to use weapons in this case, let alone a butcher’s knife. He was a very popular lad, and he was thought of very highly.

I cannot tell you how happy this makes me. After all the effing moving we have done in the past decade, it will be nice to be settled and really make this our home, instead of wondering if we can paint, do they allow dogs, will the neighbors be too loud for our in-bed-by-7pm kids? NO ONE WILL LIVE UPSTAIRS! No one will be doing their laundry beneath our apartment at 3am. No one will get drunk and be loud on a Friday night (seriously, no one. We haven't been out in forever.)

Is there some new exercise fad I haven't heard of? You know, a special exercise move? A move, if you incorporate it in your run, will eliminate another 10 calories? (10 calories is the same amount of calories you receive from smelling a donut at 20 feet.) If so, I don't think I like it. It really looks strange, and I know I'd be really embarassed to speak with someone if they should happen to stop in the middle of their run to have a conversation. What would I say? It would be a little personal to ask if there was a problem, or offer advice.
Your prayers would be so appreciated in this journey against increased liver enzymes, choking, and chronic pain. Some days I feel like being a patient is my full time job when all I dream of is going back to school and wrapping things up.
At any rate, I was pleased to see that a copy of the book is located with the National Library of Australia and that numerous citations regarding the book exist including one at wired.com. The British gaming magazine “Edge” also reviewed the book quite favorably stating that it represented: “crucial reading for anyone attempting to understand the dynamics of building an online gaming community.”

The first day of Spring --our Easter/Ostara-- we ate chocolate bunnies after breakfast (Lindt has small ones wrapped in gold foil w/red ribbon bows. They were gone before I got out the camera). We colored eggs --fresh, local eggs from our friends at Bluebird Farms. The brown and green eggs took on dye with more subdued, earthier hues.

For the most part, I sincerely appreciate Amazon's customer reviews. For example, I remember seeing Marie right after she finished Pure by Rebbecca Ray (which, for some reason, has now been retitled as A Certain Age, can anyone explain this?), and she was shaking with anger. She had just spent a couple of days reading this book in public, (on the subway, held in clear view (she was pretty much advertising the book, as we all do when we read on public transportation)), and had this to say - Marie on Pure. Her review is short and to the point. The point is, don't waste your money or your time on this book.

In Old Uncle Milton’s opinion, it is going to take a commitment by a whole new group of private sector individuals, operating as public servants, to bring our country back to its former status. And freedom must be the foremost solution to every problem that can ever be resolved by our governments. Should our public servants ever err, let it be on the side of freedom, because it is better to be too free than to be not free enough.
I absolutely LOVE it.
The end goal of designing software is to produce something which provides a benefit that is large enough for one or more customers to at least cover the cost of its production. Of course, the higher the value of that benefit, the more that folks will pay for it. On the other side of the equation you want to provide that benefit at the lowest cost. There is a point of diminishing returns both in looking for the highest possible value and in looking for the lowest possible cost.

It is difficult to fault the Governor’s logic. While some people may find it distasteful, it invites a political discussion of key issues facing our society: war and peace. It invites a discussion that, while respectful of the sacrifices of those who have fought in war, is highly critical of those who send us to war and orchestrate wars in our name.

I've moved many times since I first drank that glorious bottle of Golden Anniversary and always displayed it with pride through college and then in my 20's as a conversation piece.

I recently sent out emails and letters to pastors, theological scholars, and respected leaders in the Christian community asking them to review The Absolute Basics of Christianity prior to the publishing of the 2nd edition later this year. Not all of the reviews are in yet but I have been honored and humbled by the comments so far. If you have not taken the time to do this study I would encourage you to order a copy and go through it with some people in your church. You can read what some others had to say about the book below.
The South Granville area (map here) has the best collection of them in the city today. Like the West End a half century ago, the area has been a bastion of reasonably priced rental housing—just the sort of thing young people with low- to moderate-paying downtown jobs need. It’s a very urban little pocket, slowly being eaten away by more luxurious condos, some of which are 10-storey-or-higher concrete buildings more aloof from the street.

I’m pretty sure I can. It’s not that hard to follow the output of a younger generation, even if you’re a bit older. To think otherwise is arrogance. I mean, this is not a big city, and there are not that many outlets for bands to get heard in. So, it’s not that much of a hassle to keep an eye out. Plus, we have reviewers and journalists here that are younger than I am. And I’ve always been a digger; it’s in my nature to seek interesting stuff to listen to. And music doesn’t really have an age meter anymore. I might joke that I’m an old indie fart, that’s just because I’ve been releasing albums for 13 years. But the truth is that I’m still considered young in the music industry, I’m only 31 for Christ’s sake! I started really young. It’s not like I’m a 70 year old man, trying to be cool for the youngsters!

Hannah Mendelsohn has no desire to become a full time candy artist. She is sticking to her dream of becoming a nurse. However, there is a lesson to be learned from this woman’s desire to create. No matter whom you are or what you do for a living, you can still be artistic. You can still create.
So I called my oncologist's office and had a chat with one of my fave nurses in the world, Brenda. And she told me Dr. Lower thought we oughta go ahead and do an MRI because of those "Damn Spots", not to mention, the "Vespa Incident". I thought that sounded reasonable and that I hadn't had any really serious photo shoots of my brain since Rome, so why not?
This is Isaac with "Papa Joe." Papa Joe is actually named Hussan (sp?) He is a Kenyan who serves Indian food at a restaurant called Papa Joe's Pizza. Confused yet? Anyway, Ryan and I ate at his restaurant on the day that we prayer-walked our 7x7 and we have a bit of a heart for him. So, after we finished collecting candy, Isaac and Ryan went to thank him for giving us the pizza box that Isaac used for his costume. They asked if they could take his picture with Isaac and Papa Joe even had Isaac put on his company jacket for the photo. The boys plan to have one printed and then go have lunch and take it to Papa Joe next week. Please pray that they have an opportunity to share the Good News with him!

In short they were somewhat strange, but friendly people who quickly became annoying because I could never go to the kitchen in peace. Things got uncomfortable because he started getting really flirty with the both of us (I lived with a girl roomie at the time.) This quickly nixed us from his wife’s list of favorite kitchen neighbors. This was all very disconcerting when really I just wanted to heat up my kettle for a cup of Earl Grey. I devised ways to avoid the kitchen window and the discomfort that had arisen due to our little kitchen window love square. I would duck when I passed the window, open cabinet doors that sort of blocked the view, pretend to be on the phone. My roomie and I compared notes on the best times to go in and our most successful evasion tactics! (Good God, Forest! Grow up and buy some damn curtains! Yeah…I know)
Of course, none of the above compares to the trials facing the state of Israel, it government, its citizens, or its soldiers.

Instead of answering legitimate questions about the role for which the taxpayer paid him a vast salary, Mr Jasper and his supporters would only chant the mantra that he was “the victim of a racist campaign by racially motivated racists”, their expressions becoming progressively more alarmed at the realisation that, for the first time the magic shield wasn't working.
I would be remiss if I did not share the name and business of a lovely young woman who sat next to me at lunch. Cecilia Crossley recently had a baby and while watching a UK TV ad for orphanages, was so moved that she decided to do something about it. She is founder of From Babies With Love, a company that will donate 100% of its profit to charities supporting orphaned and abandoned children around the world. She has set up an on-line retail store to sell beautiful organic baby clothes. It’s supposed to go live in 10 days, so stay tuned. Her website is: http://www.frombabieswithlove.org/. They are truly a start-up operation, their inventory will be kept in their home, and I understand her husband will be master picker and packer. I wish them the best.

There’s no question that fan mail is fantastic. I’ve been touched and humbled by letters and emails from readers, amazed at their generous response to my novel, and moved by the details they’ve shared about their lives. These letters remind me how intimate the act of reading is. I’m not just talking about those readers who’ve taken my book into bed with them, or read it in the bath (two of my favorite places); the intimacy I’m referring to is closer than that. The act of reading allows the writer’s imagination to infiltrate her reader’s mind, where the story is reconstituted and absorbed according to that reader’s experience and understanding. A good story gets under the reader’s skin.
It’s been months since I’ve picked up a really juicy WWI RPPC photo for my collection. Last week I was able to win a small group of shots that looked promising. I knew there was one shot of doughboys wearing helmets bending down on the ground. When the photo arrived I was surprised to find that the card identified five litter bearers of Co. F of the 127th Infantry Regiment, 32nd Division. I quickly found that two of the identified doughboys received the Distinguished Service Cross in October of 1918 for saving wounded soldiers from the trenches during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Another (second from right) is William Methier – he received the Silver Star. I also identified two other men in the photo as being Edward Krawezyk and Albert Guernsey who both received Division Citations for their heroics.

For me, the story began on the evening of March 7, when my wife Denene brought my attention to a story on Reuters. The headline read “Family of Florida Boy Killed by Neighborhood Watch Seeks Arrest.” It was about a family in Florida who had held a press conference seeking justice for their 17-year-old son, Trayvon Martin, who had been murdered ten days earlier by a man named George Zimmerman, the captain of the neighborhood watch patrol in a Sanford subdivision called the Retreat at Twin Lakes.

When we left to go to India last August, we did our best in getting our house and yard ready for the fall and early winter, to be by itself. But we had lots of plants growing, that we had started because we love gardening, but mostly, because we wanted to share them with our friends who would come and watch our house while we were gone. We wanted them to have tomatoes and basil to take home. Enjoy the corn, cucumbers, lettuce, carrots and anything else that was growing and would survive without much weeding.

Mr. Ahmed Faiyaz’s “Across The Seas” leaves you dewy eyed. It’s very important to acknowledge the sacrifices of our dear ones and near ones made with a view to providing us a good future. He has done so in style. “Good Morning Nikhil” captures the pride of a father of a new born son who tends to invoke childhood memories. “It’s All Good” and “Ready, Jet Set Go!” are a commentary on contemporary India. How everybody wants to chase success sans inner peace. The style is simple and the lucidity of his prose leaves you spellbound.

Entering a thoroughly jammed waiting room, I waited in line and signed in. Breathing a sigh of relief I sat down and pulled out my book. Having read one exactly one word, I heard my name called. Yeah. However, it was the receptionist and not the nurse summoning me. Giving her my name she inquired as to why I was there. Telling her what my health issue was, she restated asking why I was there at all as I had no appointment on the books for this morning. Really? Searching the database we determined it was tomorrow morning and I was a bit too early to just sit and read until the doctor showed up.

Most often blocks exist because the characters do not have internal conflicts. Give an antagonist a personal conflict and that will stop her from many actions, even force her to do things that at first glance seem out of character. Fears, insecurities and past events can create great internal conflicts for any character.
In the end, Taylor fails to “sort out just who is, and who isn’t, a Londoner” or fully comprehend his home. This is central to the book’s success, because this limitation acknowledges the fundamental elusiveness and complexity of the world’s most interesting cities. This isn’t to say nothing is learned. Londoners is overflowing with life and detail. It’s one of those books whose pleasures derive from dipping randomly into the pages, slowly savoring what you find over months’ time. Aside from the wild anecdotes and charged language, what Londoners offers above all is an antidote to all the common, negative characterizations of the city as cold, difficult, dirty and mean. As a Transport for London Lost Property clerk says in the second chapter, despite the “bleak view of London,” “there’s a hell of a lot of good people here. It’s a testament to the honesty of Londoners and people in general who hand things in.” It’s something I think about during my regular bouts of Anglophilia, where I rewatch Fawlty Towers and eat crisps in the desperate ways armchair travelers do when they can’t afford a plane ticket.

“But then my folks, like yours, had other ideas and I decided to play by their rules. Now, I don’t regret it . . . maybe I do a little. Thing is, Evie, you can sing like a nightingale and you can play the guitar like nobody’s business. You need to get the hell out of this town before you wind up like every other girl here—knocked up, changing dirty diapers, and cleaning up after some idiot male who spends his nights with a beer in one hand and a TV remote in the other.”
Setting out on drive on the most perfect autumns morning, cool, clear and not a breath of wind. I received a message from our neighbour informing me that he had seen the three Sohobele Male lions the previous evening sitting on our Southern Access road. Now were Chad has his Leopards I have my Lions and although the Timbavati Pride are very near and dear to my heart the Sohobele Males have to be my firm favourite. Their story is one of pure courage, determination and the ultimate will to survive. They have overcome all adversities thrown their way from being orphaned way before their time, split from one another for extended periods of time, to walking day and night in search of a meal and recovering from the many mauling they received at the tooth and claw of other Lions. So to hear that all three of them were here on our doorstep, all my plans for the morning went out the window and become solely focused on finding these long lost friends. I knew exactly who to call to come help as he must be the one other person that could possibly love them more than me, Johannes. On calling him he had already got wind of the message and was already on his way to the area. Both he and I checked to the North East of the camp, while Marka checked further to the East to make sure they had not turned back to Kruger. It was not long before I found where they had been chasing a large male Buffalo. Johannes also had found where they had trailed behind that same Buffalo further to my North West. This was good news as they were heading deeper into our traversing area. Johannes and I went onto foot to determine exactly the direction they were heading. We found were they had relocated on the Buffalo and split into hunting formation. The Buffalo had continued to the West so Johannes and I returned to the vehicles and while he checked to the North, I proceeded to check further to the West. With the ground being very hard after the recent rain and somewhat rocky we painstakingly patrolled the area looking for any tell-tale sign of their presence. On reaching our Western boundary I turned to the South and started to check towards the airstrip. Johannes meanwhile had found a track further to the North heading in a North Westerly direction, this was not good as it was heading directly towards our boundary. Johannes proceeded to check the boundary road but did not come up with anything and was on his way back to the last tracks that he had seen to start following up from there when he heard Impala alarm calling further to the North than where he had just checked. Ever aware of his surroundings and the tell tale signs he contacted me to let me know that he was heading to check on the alarm call and that I must not go far. Sure enough two minutes later he contacted me to let me know that he had found them and we were in luck as they were now making their way South back into our traversing area. Not leaving anything to chance I rushed in his direction to find one male walking majestically down the road towards us. The other two had just left the road as they had seen a herd of Kudu and were once again on the hunt. Not wanting to disturb them we sat as they set up their ambush unfortunately one of the females got wind of them and let off the loud alarm bark. With their cover blown the three of them once again set off South through a nice open area that afforded us a good view of them. Although they looking a little on the lean side, story of their lives, one can see the gene's of their father, the great Sohobele Male, starting to blossom and given time these youngsters while develop into majestic males like their dad. With a lot of interest being shown in the sighting we would soon have to make space so others could also enjoy them. Shortly before we left though they went into hunt mode again and set up an ambush on two Warthog. This time they came very close to pulling it off and had the one brother been in position in time I'm sure they would have pulled it off. I was glad to see nothing has changed with them and they are still ever the opportunists, so not that different to your Leopards there Chad. It has been the major factor in their survival. I tried to figure out the last time I saw them and came up with it nearly being six months, lets hope they hang

All this being the case, authors have to do some additional analysis to make a sensible decision. Reasonable questions to ask would include, How much is the advance? How much do I need the advance? Do I think that with higher self-publishing royalties, I can beat the contract (to see what I mean with that concept, follow the last paragraph in this Daily Beast interview)? If so, how long do I expect beating the contract will take? How important is paper distribution to me, and how important is digital? How important to me is control over things like pricing and packaging? How important is time-to-market? How much do I like, and how good am I at, running my own business vs. outsourcing business management to someone else? How much do I trust my potential business partner to manage things well? How much do I hate what legacy publishers are doing today vs how much do I fear what Amazon might do tomorrow? Which system gives me more personal power to influence my odds of success, and how important is that power to me? Etc. If you make a decision without asking such questions, you're making a mistake, at least in your process (though you can still get lucky in your result). If you are asking these questions, then regardless of the path you choose, you're making an informed decision, and for you, the right one.
Much of the information that we communicate happens non-verbally via subtle signals we put out with our posture, gestures and attitude. It’s no surprise, then, that your success in a job interview depends quite a bit on almost everything except what you actually say. Recently, WiseBread explained the most common body language mistakes people make in interviews and how to avoid them. Here are the highlights:
My initial plan was to replace any lines with 1/2 and I do have the copper fittings to do so. However, my plumber thought the smaller lines would be fine. If I were ambitious I would all the lines. But, I'm not. Instead I will just be vaguely unhappy when I use the sink.
And so, as our obsession with sex has swelled, so also have those “industries” that cater to it: some sculpted toward men, some toward women, and some that hope to appeal to both. The overall effect is an amplified pressure to forgo all thought of the future in preference for the impulses and sensations of the present.”
You're probably familiar with the kiddie song "My toes, my knees, my shoulder, my head" or maybe the other one that goes, "Head, shoulders, knees and toes" and I'm sure you've got a body part of your baby that you simply adore. My little girl has these chubby cheeks that I can't get enough of. I love to kiss her and sometimes I pinch her cheeks because they are so cute and soft.
It took only a month for Melissa to realise that she had damaged her eye. 'It got more and more sore and bloodshot,' she says. 'It was as if I had conjunctivitis all the time. It was sore and weepy, very sensitive. I was really frightened.'
It’s been talked about for years, but it bears repeating: Agencies need to commit to hiring a diverse workforce at all levels. If they don’t, they risk creating work that doesn’t appeal to the changing demography of the nation. Speaking openly, Ogilvy North American Chairman-CEO John Seifert said the agency received its latest cultural survey last week, and called it “depressing” because “we hadn’t achieved what we set out to do.”

Lets say infidelity has invaded your marriage. Your partner is horribly remorseful and you are so heartbroken you are lost. You NEVER thought your partner was capable of such an act. The affair(s) all over. You are being begged for a second chance. You realized that the partner is NOT the person you once thought, he/she DOES NOT have a problem lying to you, this is obvious from the lies to cover the affair(s), he/she obviously has no problem being sexual with another person either. You have faced the facts and you really know the risks now. You see that your partner really does feel your pain. They REALLY seem to feel your pain and they say they figured out that no one else will ever do… What do you do?
Entities: this is a very important word. An entity is a “coagulation” of atoms of matter that exist in a specific form or body. Form becomes the deciding factor in qualifying a particular type of being – be it animal, plant, human, mineral, or part of one of the “invisible” kingdoms. We want you to get accustomed to thinking of the four seasons as entities.

Emmett and his brother abandon the Planet and go to a distant colony called the White Sands, located on the moon of Dust. White Sands is under constant attacks from the outcasts. Here, Emmett faces dual challenge of warding off the Outcasts and win trust of the inhabitants. Rift energy of Frontier had to be mined for use and the miners were referred as Rifters. As with most technology advancements, even rift energy got mismanaged and infected a group of miners, mutating them into crazy and violent monsters called the Outcasts in the Starhawk Game. Now, the planet of Frontier is in state of perpetual war between Rifters and Outcasts. This feature will make Starhawk different from the previous stationary-path based traditional action-shooter games. It can give a tough competition to Gears of War 3, which is also a third-person shooter game as well. I found the trailer of the game to be surreal, projecting a sort of parallel universe tangled in wars. Starhawk could challenge serious gamers to outsmart multiple opponents by making strategies in real time. Come May 8, the wait for Starhawk tips and tricks will be over! There is a buzz among gamers on online forums and discussion groups about few features of the game. What makes this game better from its successors is its feature of structural placement that allows the gamers to arrange the structure of entire team, from the walls to bunkers. Besides, the gamers can launch an aerial combat with a set of jets, mechs, and jeeps.
Oook...let's talk about the Documentary screening. I got to know about it through different groups i had joined on f.book. I'll post all their links at the bottom of the post.

For people outside Saudia who don't know what Aramco might be, its an American company that has been helping Saudi Arabia with it Petroleum production since 1933.

This transformation will not be fun, but it is necessary. Our standard of living must decline to reflect years of reckless consumption and the disintegration of our industrial base. Only by swallowing this tough medicine now will our sick economy ever recover. By accepting a lower standard of living today, we will eventually be rewarded with a higher one tomorrow.

Hello Woodware USA fans!! We have a fun sketch for you today from our very own -- Kerry Urbatch!! I love Kerry's sketches because they are always so indicative of her awesome style! We hope you love this week's sketch. I believe you can even adapt it into a square card if you would like...let your imagination be your guide!! However, I love shaking it up a bit and having a shaped card along the way!
I love books! So much that I follow some of the most intriguing children’s authors on Twitter and, once in a while, pester them with my bizarre and insightful comments or questions. Earlier this week, my four-year-old wanted to play with a gently used solar system kit we purchased at a second hand store. He loves it because each planet has two pieces you snap together, so he likes to put things inside the planets and pretend that gives them special “powers”. For this activity, I wanted to play in the dining room, which is usually reserved for puzzles and holiday dinner set up. So, it’s been a while since we’ve spent time in this room.
NT: Horrible vending machine coffee. Mr Plod is always very civil to me and I am always very civil to him too. He has a job to do and it’s quite an important one. I haven’t met a single person who would disagree with your view on the last arrest though.
We’ll start at the end. Why? Because that’s where the raw emotion is coming from right now. The END. The end of everything I thought was real and good and “meant to be”. The end of this person I have become. The end of caring and being open and being SOMEBODY. In his eyes, I’m worthless. I hold no value. I am not IMPORTANT. Fortunately I am grounded enough to know I am IMPORTANT to many others, but it doesn’t stop the hurt from finding out I never mattered to a person who led me to believe I did. Not once. Not ever. In 20 years, I never made an impact. I was just a piece of trash. Maybe a paper plate. Good for a few times, but eventually just needs to be thrown away. Maybe an old tire. Too many miles put on, time to trade her in for a new set.

Dr Meier continued: “We have to be careful and have to study more MS brains but this is potentially very exciting research. Now we understand how EBV gets smuggled into the brain by cells of the immune system and that it is found at the crime scene, right where the attack on our nervous system occurs. Now we know this, we may have a number of new ways of treating or even preventing the disease.”
Our Lord gives us these things to celebrate His presence in our lives. He gives us these things to appreciate with joy. For us, change is inevitable. We can fight it and miss out on the gifts God gives us, or we can embrace change and make the most of every moment.
Nothing more than a forgotten shadow
I don't tend to read an awful lot of non-fiction but I'm lucky that when I do it tends to be first rate. This memoir was literally forced into my hand by an excited publicist and her enthusiasm wasn't misplaced. The prose is beautiful as you might expect from a poet and its evocations of childhood innocence are heart-warming and comforting. When it follows Garfitt's misadventures at university and beyond it becomes a fascinating portrait of a mind unravelling and the writing shows the tissue-thin barriers between lunatic, lover and poet. A book that took many years to write and hone, and the passion of one publisher in particular to finally bring to print, this is a labour of love and madness that rewards the effort.
You can customise the shortcuts in the settings menu and the ring can be loaded up at any time. It’s not exactly a stand-out feature, but we did find it became useful as we began to use the tablet.

It's a nice little between the two of them in the Stackhouse kitchen when Alcide informs Sookie that Russell Edgington has been dug up from his grave. I had forgotten that Sookie wasn't actually aware of what really happened to the former vampire king so her reaction is fairly interesting here.

Lee's stewed duck was a popular dish at our table, perhaps because it was one of the few dishes without chilli. The duck is stewed whole and then served as fine slices doused with a sweet soy sauce. The meat was exceptionally tender, although I personally found the duck flavour disappointingly mild and the sauce a little too sweet.
What advice would you give to anyone interested in pursuing a media?
As I took some time to browse the internet on Stumbleupon I came across a website that linked to Youtube and this couple called Nikki and John. This couple keep their relationship alive with the pranks they constantly play on one another, some of them are hilarious and of course some are very toilet humour; and surely it is a true sign of trust and love, in order for them to accept one another completely and go back to their loving relationship as normal just after one has ‘glued the other’s bum to the toilet seat’. This got me thinking that what people tend to forget is this; you can put someone on a pedestal for so long, but there comes a time in the relationship where the ice has to be broken and the toilet seat well and truly ‘cling filmed’. I am not suggesting that we all play pranks on one another, what I am saying is that there comes a time where we have to accept that our partner is human and that they have bodily functions just like we do, that they have habits just like we do and if we’re going to have a long term relationship with that person it is a part of them that we have to learn to accept and show a sense of humour about.
July was a busy month for me, but somehow I found a sliver of time to participate in the Summer 2011 Dining on a Dollar Contest on Food.com. It's always a surprise to me when I enter more than one recipe in a contest to see which one gets the most attention. There is always one that I put the most time and effort into, convinced that it's the best creation, and there is always one (or maybe two) that I feel are good, but not great. It amazes me that the less I over-think a recipe the more attention it gets. Someday I might learn that it's always going to be that way and I'll quit over-thinking... well, maybe.
Yup, that'll do it.
I'm taking part in this challenge. Reason: 1) I want to be more disciplined in posting entries. 2) It's fun. I look forward to reading other participating bloggers post during this challenge. 3) I hope I can expand my blogger circle of friends through this challenge.

Um, well, no. It's not as dramatic as all that.
Terminator is an intresting take on artifical intelligence. The idea that man could construct a computer that would eventually become intelligent enough to think for itself and take over the world. Although perhaps more futuristic than the 20th/21st time period in which it is set, it cannot be considered altogether as far fetched as it may at first seem. What perhaps is far fetched in Terminated Salvation is half man, half terminator. It is unclear whether Skynet had intended to control him through artifical intellegience or convince him to join their side. However, it does create interesting question of where the Terminator franchise will turn to in the future and how they will run with the idea of A.I. The Terminator itself remains as terrifying as it was in the first film, but the development of drones, bike mounted terminators and large machines builds a picture of a world where A.I. knows no limits. It is impossible to see how the human race will survive.
But I think what's really holding me together is the fact that this is only for 5 days. And I'm on hump day. For 5 days I can make changes. I can tell myself "It's not forever. Surely you can manage this for just 5 measly days you soft-centred lily-livered sooky bubba" (I tend to get a little Sergeant-Majorish with myself at times.)

Incidentally, alignments are done away with for player characters (PCs), although non-player characters (NPCs) can be inimical, neutral or allied. This strikes me as very true to the spirit of EPT, with player and group trusted to use their judgements, make the game world their own and fly by the seat of their pants.
Kylie is 2 months old! I love that little girl to death, but I'll be honest: I'm ready for her to grow up a little faster. I have loved every second of the toddler stage with Cameron, and I can't wait until I can hold cute little conversations with her. I can't stop kissing those cheeks.

Oh and I haven´t told you about Tatiane yet! I think that she was the first person that I met in Santa Cruz do Sul. The sisters had met her on the bus a few weeks ago and gotten her address, but had never been able to find her at home after that. So we went by and found her at home with her 3 little girls...Andressa, Nadiesca and Michelle. We talked for a while and I told her that I had served in Rio Pardo for six months and she said "Oh! My good friend moved to Rio Pardo from Vera Cruz 6 months ago!" Yup...her "good friend" is Elizângela! Crazy, huh? Rio Pardo is small...but not That small!! It is so amazing how Heavenly Father works! Tatiane said that she remembers when Elizângela was baptized in Vera Cruz 2 years ago and the huge difference that she had seen the church make in her life. Tatiane said that she really needs that peace and light in her life right now....she seems very sad and depressed and told us that she is going through a very difficult situation with her husband right now. I´m excited that she already has seen the how the gospel has changed Elizângela. She seems like she has a sincere desire to feel the same peace in her own life...Heavenly Father really does literally lead us to those whose hearts are prepared to receive us! We called the sisters in Rio Pardo (Sister Grant and....Sister Oliveira!!! :D) to see if they can ask Elizângela to write her testimony in a Book of Mormon for us to give Tatiane next week.

Where does bullying really live? What is this bullying all about, on the inside, for me? Well, we know that bullying lives within us, because it seems fairly obvious that most of us are in constant battle with ourselves. And if I ask the question, “where does it come from” and I go inward a bit, I come up with the pretty obvious answer: on every level, bullying comes from me.

I often get the feeling that he really doesn’t work as hard as he could. I mean, when he works, he does work hard. It’s just that there are so many times when he isn’t working. And in all the years since he started this business (five), I’ve told him that he needs to have a back-up plan, another way to earn money. The income from this job is not consistent, though usually it has been o.k. And it is a physical job, so he could be hurt. He also may not be able to continue doing it as long as he could do a less physical job.
The middle word of the first sentence is, “את.” This word is pronounced, “et.” It is a word without a single meaning, but rather, a word which modifies the subject. In Prayerbook Hebrew the Easy Way, there is an entire chapter dedicated to understanding this word. Truth be told, it is a hard one to interpret, if it may always be interpreted.
That being said, what I can do is describe the nature of these different works in order to help you make a more informed decision about where to begin your reading of these great authors or, perhaps, how to continue your reading of them.

At the moment I'm still a butchery dilettante — long on meat enthusiasm, short on knife skills. I've always wanted do something about that, so I recently took Fleisher's Butchery 101 course (you can see some photos I took here), and I'll be going back up to Kingston to learn more. If all goes well — in other words, if I don't lop off a finger — the progression of my "personal butchery journey" may become an occasional feature here on the blog.
Here's how it started:

If a woman was being physically abused, we would tell her, don’t let yourself get hit. Get out of there. Get away from him.
On my second day in Iceland, I went horseback riding. The Icelandic horse is a fascinating animal. My horse was Long Nose (I know how to say it in Icelandic, but have no idea how to write it). He was beautiful, a great horse, but a wee bit stubborn. He liked riding a little too close to the edge of sloped roads. At least too close for my tastes. It didn’t bother me at first, but then some of the horses would get too close to each other and once one started to trot, the others would follow and that led to overcrowding and pushing. It wasn’t anything super dangerous, but I wasn’t comfortable with it. So I’d steer Long Nose away from the edge or just slow him down. He wasn’t having it the first few times I tried to steer him. But I wasn’t having it either. So I persisted in steering him away from the edge and then he started to listen. After a while, it dawned on me that I’d grown. Two years ago, I would have given up and let that horse do whatever it wanted. But instead, I made my comfort level a priority and gave consideration to my instincts. I don’t know when it happened, but somewhere in the last few months, I’d gotten confident and now riding through the Icelandic countryside, I could clearly see that confidence. I literally sat up straighter in my saddle and smiled. During the course of the ride, there were a few more stubborn moments with Long Nose and there were a handful of times that he did get his way (I’m copping it up to the fact that he is a Viking Horse). But he was a still a great horse and I really wouldn’t have wanted any other horse but him.
We do a disservice to the people who seek Christ when all we do is gather together and enjoy a well-thought out service. We can easily misguide people into thinking that it’s all about enjoyment and entertainment. We end up selling a bag of chips that seems completely full and yet half is air. We need to make sure that we give people Jesus – All of Him! May we not get caught up in our wonderful worlds of technology and ignore the fact that God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit must draw people to Himself.
If you can get in first with an advertisement campaign, you have an advantage. Google AdWords rewards advertisers who write copy that attracts clicks by lowering the cost per click that these advertisers have to pay to get their ads listed near the top of the list. This way, ads can build up history. One way of getting into this market is by striking while the iron is hot. If you can find a vendor that has just started an affiliate programme, you may be able to get in with a good ad before anyone else does.

Really? And if somebody in a position of power thinks it's a 'good thing', then it will be forced on us, in each and every commercial, on all channels. How is that for 'diversity'? Where are the alternatives for those who don't see things through the distorting lenses of political correctness?
If you thought Madison's life was hectic in Top 8, well you haven't seen anything yet, because in What's Your Status everything seems to be going wrong. For one, because of some unintended innuendo and an unfortunate hand gesture, Maddie's boyfriend thinks that she wants to go all the way, which is far from reality. Add in the facts that she just lost her school's most coveted treasure, her best friend is dealing with something major problems, and her other one is mad at her, well, let's just say that Maddie's prom season will be anything but forgettable.

The effort led by the United States to move the debate outside WIPO has raised alarm for some developing nations who fear the meetings are intended to pressure them and WIPO to trim development objectives from the negotiations. In fact, many developing countries view efforts to negotiate a substantive patent law treaty as an attempt by developed countries to â€œexport their patent systems to other parts of the world,â€� one developing country official said. They also fear it would undermine the flexibility countries have under the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights to pursue their own policy goals, the official said, adding that that flexibility is reaffirmed by the Doha Declaration on TRIPs and public health.
BLITZER: All right. We’re in the last few minutes of the last question to these four presidential candidates before the Florida primary on Tuesday in this debate format. Here is the question, and it involves the president of the United States. I want you to tell voters who are watching or are here on this campus right now why you are the one person on this stage that is most likely to beat Barack Obama.
I think the discussion of chibchombianos stemmed from a comparison of Bogotá and Medellín. My students pointed out that maybe part of the reason people living in Bogotá are not as proud and respectful of their city may be that being the capital there are far more inhabitants from the rest of Colombia. Whereas Medellín, with it’s fame for regionalist pride, is made-up primarily of paisas born n’raised. I think there could be some truth to that, though if we look at cities like New York or San Francisco the argument doesn’t hold. I guess the difference being, that people migrate to San Francisco or New York out of desire while people land in Bogotá more often than not out of necessity.

The government spends 2.5 billion dollars on reservations each year. This 2.5 billion breaks down into 50 million for tribal colleges, 14.4 million for completed settlements, 5.1 million for a Loan program, 14.2 million for central oversight, and 27 million for estate services. Also an additional 354.7 million is being spent this year to add public safety and justice to Indian reservations all through America. This change will bring a reduction in crime throughout the reservations.

It is therefore slanderous to the Holy Spirit to choose an interpretation of a particular passage that unnecessarily brings that passage into conflict with that which He has revealed elsewhere. So the governing principle of Reformed hermeneutics or interpretation is the analogy of faith.

Short periods of boredom are to be expected, but extended boredom is a good definition of depression. When the mind is deprived it turns in on itself and literally punishes an individual for starving it of activity. People do a lot of foolish things to escape boredom and that applies to entire nations as well.
Kölsch is an interesting and rare style, as it is like a hybrid of a lager and an ale, reining from Cologne, Germany. Lawnmower is fermented using an ale yeast and is lagered, which means that it is cold-conditioned at lower temperatures (around 35° F) which in this case will lend a bit of sweet complexity with the ale yeast, yet will be quite crisp and mild with a lighter color.

Can physical traumas affect the mind? Can mental states affect the body? Absolutely yes in both cases. To draw a hard line between the 2 is simplistic and naïve. However, if we think about them as different aspects of the same thing, different members of the same team, different faces of the same whole, then we open ourselves up to other approaches.

Speaking of Valerie Trueblood, I'm pleased that an essay I wrote about her and her writing has made the shortlist of the Thresholds Feature Writing Competition. There's a shortlist of ten.

I love when people curious about these phrases and I explained to them that these are cleansing phrases. These five phrases are commonly use in daily life but many do not aware that these phrases has cleansing power. It cleanses ourselves from the unnecessary thoughts that we restore inside our mind especially our subconscious minds. In another article, it says that:
“I can’t begin to express how grateful our whole family is to the wonderful staff at Blessings! for Seniors for the way they dealt with the needs of my 96-year-old dad on very short notice. His wife had become very ill and, unbeknownst to our family in the Midwest, had neglected him severely as her illness progressed. He had lost weight, was unable to drive to get groceries, was missing medical appointments, and living in unsanitary conditions. Within a day of the heavenly arrival of Zonda and Linda from Blessings, he was enjoying home-cooked meals, a clean house, grocery shopping and rides to doctor appointments, and unfailingly kind, comforting and cheerful care. The Blessings women took extraordinary care of all his needs until we were able to bring him home to the Midwest to residential memory care. Thank you, thank you, thank you–you were indeed a blessing to our beloved senior.”

This is the question that springs to mind in the post GFC world. Now it’s important to note that I don’t mean that the GFC is over but rather that the economic outlook for the globe is structurally very different now after the events of 2007/08/09 it’s just that I don’t know what to call it. New Normal doesn’t seem to fit, post GFC seems to assume it’s over and clearly it’s not. I quite like The Prince’s name for it: The Great Volatility.
If admission of errors in doctrine and action is made openly, a stronger case for the merits of Christianity can be made as well. Moreover, such errors and resulting offenses are evident in the history of all the Abrahamic religions, and though mostly ended for the Jews when their theocratic nationhood ended shortly after Jesus’ ministry, it continues in Islam, stronger every day. Similarly, though the litany of whitey’s crimes is now recited by 8-year-olds in every school between Berlin and Auckland, Whites under African or Muslim rule, whether as slaves or just minority prey, have suffered more than Africans or Muslims have suffered under White rule. Had Africa invaded Europe in the 18th-19th centuries rather than Europe Africa, neither this computer nor this writer could have existed.

On the other side of the highway from this very lonely-looking hotel stands everything you might expect to find in a small Canadian town. Actually, now that I’m thinking about it, it’s really got everything that is quintessentially Canadian, crammed and squished together in a very small area. It’s quite remarkable. Of course, one of the many shops in this area is Tim Hortons, and it is this particular location that we’ve been frequenting recently. As far as I know, we had never discussed what each individual store was with the children, and we certainly hadn’t mentioned what the hotel across the highway was, which is what makes the following interaction all the more ridiculous:

Other guided tours from Cuzco take a more circuitous route and include activities such as downhill biking, rafting and/or hiking and then culminate with a visit to Machu Picchu. Again this is probably fun, but it is not for us. Our goal is to see Machu Picchu, nothing more nothing less. Everything else for us is an unnecessary distraction.

Gulen, in his application for permanent residency in the United States, maintained that he was “an educator of extraordinary ability and renown.” But Gulen does not possess an elementary school education, let alone a high school diploma. He is semi-literate and speaks no English. To substantiate his ability and renown, Gulen, on his application, provides a long list of his scholarly works. But all of his works have been published by The Light Publishing Company and Tughra Press, two firms that are owned by the Gulen movement.

Despite my overall love for the film, and past arguments I’ve made about how it is criminally disregarded and outright dismissed in the post-apocalyptic genre, the set-up here is reductive and cliched in that the endured apocalypse (“pox-eclipse” for the children in the crack in the earth) was initiated by, and identical to, a dispute between the “two men,” which is patently untrue even given the limited background. This cold war era film clearly references competing ideologies and, dare I say, STATES fighting and warring and destroying everything. The lesson from this in this scene is that the source of wide scale violence, genocide, ecocide, apocalypse, etc. is human nature (especially male human nature, underwritten here by the quasi-masculinized, female figure of power that I might discuss later), which is inherently acquisitive and willing to risk annihilation for the sake of control, property (Max is unhappy about his truck and camels being taken), or . . . something.

I think that there is now a very grave crisis of religious life, and that one should not speak of renewal, but rather of decadence. I think that this crisis is hitting the Atlantic area above all. Eastern Europe and the countries of Africa and Asia present in this regard a better state of spiritual health. This crisis is manifesting itself in all areas. The evangelical counsels are no longer considered as consecrations to God, but are seen in a sociological and psychological perspective. We are concerned about not presenting a bourgeois facade, but on the individual level poverty is not practiced. The group dynamic replaces religious obedience; with the pretext of reacting against formalism, all regularity of the life of prayer is abandoned and the first consequence of this state of confusion is the disappearance of vocations, because young people require a serious formation. And moreover there are the numerous and scandalous desertions of religious who renege on the pact that bound them to the Christian people.
What astounds me is that people don't think I've got a plan. That I'm just traveling all willy nilly and not thinking of the future.

But most egregiously, even if we accept Brooks at his word that things are starting to look bright all over, he fails to examine both sides of the ledger and factor in the cost in terms of our blood (over 4000 Americans killed and multiples of that wounded) and treasure (probably over $2 trillion dollars), not to mention the pain and suffering of millions of Iraqis (and a minimum of 100,000 civilian deaths). With that accounting in mind, I’d want a lot more bang for the buck than we are seeing in Iraq even if I were a simple utilitarian (and I’m willing to concede that some gains for the living in Iraq have been made).

Why? Personally I think it comes down to two things – training and organization. We certainly have athletes in this country of 350 Million people, with the physical attributes necessary to put up the same type of marks all the athletes I’ve listed once did. But somehow we’re not identifying, nurturing and developing those athletes – in large part because, in my opinion, we lack the organization to do so. The old Eastern Bloc programs of East Germany and the Soviet Union were the epitome of identification and development of athletes. Today, Jamaica has focused in on sprinting identifying athletes early and funneling them to their best programs. We in contrast have not changed from the days of the Eastern Bloc to now – we are still relying on individuals to rise to the top on their own. That’s why the Eastern Bloc made it so hard on us in the 70’s and 80’s; why the African nations have virtually run us off the podium in the middle and long distances; and why Jamaica has “caught up” to us in sprinting.

If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee: And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers. And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.

I hesitate only because art does not support me. And how does one present oneself publicly when there is a smoke screen that everything is alright in cyberspace. Facebook is the epitome of creating a persona that is endlessly upbeat and proactive. In the photography Facebook world or network, it's important to keep up this spotless facade of daily success whether it be creatively, emotionally, or most of all financial. One must always be on top of things and informed and super Type A productive. This is by the way, not only my impression.

While Annabelle’s problem in the first book was dealing with a trend that became too popular (a rather nice problem to have), here she had to deal with a birthday party that became less popular every time the reader turns the page. Yet regardless of the different arcs, the themes of the two books are still similar. If our initial creative vision creates problems, we need to be resilient and come up with new ideas. In the end, it is our creative vision that allows us to express our individuality.

In August of 2011, Allen Crawford (aka Lord Whimsy) left his house to embark on a three-day, forty-mile solo kayak trek from Mount Holly, NJ to Bartram's Garden, in West Philadelphia. This May 18th, Crawford will present a video using footage shot from his kayak during this trek. He will also give a slideshow presentation, highlighting the strange history along these rivers he traversed: fugitive slave enclaves, floating churches, Civil-War era submarines, and derelict aircraft carriers all await you. This expedition was a re-exploration of Philadelphia's landscape, and an investigation of how its built and grown environments have affected each other over time. This landscape is not pristine, but it is wild--and perhaps most important, it's new. The "local frontier" exists!
Then a few years ago, another threat quietly crept into the children's book world and threatened catastrophe, especially for libraries and fans of vintage books. In 2008, in the wake of recalls of popular toys (made in China) for high lead levels, Congress nearly unanimously passed a law intended to protect children: the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA). This law, among other things, required that ALL children's products aimed at kids 12 and under be tested and certified to be (basically) lead-free. Lead is a known neurotoxin and children are especially vulnerable.

Prepare the cream sauce. Melt the butter in a heavy bottom enamel pot, taking care not to let it burn. Dust with the rice flour, and stir until it's all damp and sizzling. Stir in the milk a bit at a time with a wire whisk over a low heat until all the milk is used. Keep stirring as the sauce thickens and stir in the parmesan until it's melted and smooth. Set aside to cool.
Since I am Molly and Toby’s “mom”, my husband is going to take me out to lunch and to see The Avengers in celebration of Mother’s Day. But on this day I reflect on all of the real mothers out there raising actual children, not two incredibly cute cats. I think of all of my friends who have kids and all of the choices and decisions (most of them difficult) that they have had to make on behalf of their children. All of my friends are amazing moms– whether they’re the moms of tweeners, twins (or in one case a three year old and 8 month old twins), toddlers, and those they have adopted. They have juggled their schedules, changed their jobs, altered the course of their lives for their children. Many of my friends teach and have kids, which just boggles my brain. Even my four-legged, purring “child” has been a mother– she gave birth and nursed her litter before she was put up for adoption at the SPCA. Her foster mom and staff all reported what an excellent mother she was.

Similar to the Direct Headline, this one not only cuts to the chase, it informs. This could include a new book release announcement, improved cover art, a lower price or some special offer for a limited time only. Many of you use this style headline, from what I can tell reading my own twitterstream full of book promo tweets. Ask yourself, is this really the best representation of your brand? If it is, go forth and announce the news. I suspect, however, you're using this style tweet because it's the easiest to figure out how to write. Don't be lazy. Brand your tweets authentically.

We discussed the weather last night when she dropped me off after our salsa class, and made the decision to postpone our lake swim until next Saturday. It will make for a busy day, because that night we will be dancing our little hearts out at Salsa Heat's Saturday Night Salsa Social in the Slightly Bigger Town Next to Our Small Town. We are nothing if not up for the task of enjoying two great events in one day. Especially when that day happens to be the day before my birthday!

I think that means I’m going on the job market this summer. Or, at least, I think I’m preparing myself to go on the market, but it will take the right job for me to leave.

Anyway, we all need a handsome man in our lives, someone who reminds us everyday how beautiful we are even when we forget. Someone who listens, makes us laugh and feel good about ourselves, a handsome man.
I've banged on often about the importance of saving our libraries here and elsewhere, along with many others on this blog. If all these children do not own a book, for a variety of reasons, many of which are to do with socio-economic factors, where are they most likely to be helped to appreciate that books and reading are important? School? Of course. But many school librarians have now felt the sharp sting of the axe edge. So, the local library - if there is one left. This is why I beg all of you to put a date in your diaries, Saturday 4th February, 2012, which has been designated National Libraries Day. Much will be happening, and your support will be vital. You can keep an eye on what's going on by joining the Campaign for the Book's Official Facebook page, where you will find regular updates on this and other library news from Alan Gibbons. We must all make our voices heard, and loudly, to preserve what we already have for those millions of children and adults who need access to libraries and books so badly. Damn those who say libraries are not important, and an extravagance in this time of recession and cuts. Our libraries are an essential cornerstone of literacy. They are essential, full stop.
In dependence upon this request, if I believe that Dorje Shugden is indeed accomplishing his function for myself and for all the beings of my dream, that will become my living reality. For all practical purposes, by believing this to be the case it becomes true (all of the attainments I desire arise from merely remembering you…). From an experiential perspective, it will feel as if I am already abiding within Dorje Shugden’s pure land.
At Vespers yesterday afternoon the antiphons O magnum pietatis opus etc were sung with psalms 109, 110, 111, 112 and 116. The Office hymn was the magnificent Vexilla regis, last heard towards the end of the Mass of the Pre-Sanctified on Good Friday morning, but the verse O Crux ave differed by one line, Paschale quae fers gaudium. After the collect of the feast a commemoration was sung of the preceding feast of the Octave Day of the Solemnity of St. Joseph and of St. Athanasius. At Compline the Dominical psalms were, Te lucis was sung with the Paschal Doxology and the Dominical preces were omitted.

But there are less obvious markets as well. In all countries including the United States, in most corporations, there are entire swaths of employees, from directors to vice presidents and higher, who are without formal skills in everything from financial management to project management to leadership. This “winging-it” middle management – who often resemble MBA’s in everything but skills - represent tremendous penalties to shareholder value. The lowering of MBA’s costs will greatly increase their adoption by these employees who desperately need the skills.

Formerly the old Toy building, 50,000 square feet of repurposed space devoted to food, conquers any craving you could conjure. They will even wash and chop your vegetables for you. If you've seen most New York kitchens, it makes perfect sense. To feed our souls, we hit the Metropolitan Museum of Art. If I lived in New York I would go every week and be a brilliant (and thin) connoisseur. There is no such thing as having "done" the Met. There are always more, new ways of seeing art. On the way over, I can never resist a stop at Bardith.
That jury failed to reach agreement on how much he should be awarded, and another jury later ordered Ford to pay Kearns $6.3 million, trimmed by a judge to $5.2 million. To settle the case, the car giant later agreed to pay $10.2 million and to drop all appeals.

I watched it, and he was right. It was the story about how the Tucson school board banned high schools from teaching a Mexican-American studies class. You can watch the video if you want. I didn’t get too bent out of shape before work, because it’s John Stewart, so the interview with the school board member was funny, in addition to horrifying, and also because it didn’t surprise me at all.
They deny you. I offer.

A friend recently got had a new tattoo done, and in the resulting conversation my own ink was mentioned. She had seen it before, a long time ago, but had forgotten what it was, so I showed her. It’s just a small icon on my hip, and if I wear full briefs or trunks, is entirely covered, but on the day in question I was wearing one of the tangas pictured above. I undid my belt and trousers and pulled them down at the side (FYI this is not going to get at all sexual), at which point my underwear obviously caught her eye. As the wasteband is nothing more than a broad elastic strip, and as the back panel (which is much like that of a full brief) wasn’t visible at all, she laughingly queried “You’re not wearing a G-string are you?” Thankfully, in the circumstance, I was not, I was unflustered by the accusation, and hopefully my answer was sufficiently prompt and negative to leave no doubt. Had my underwear been different, or had there been any hint of guilt in my denial, I can only guess at the consequences.

Short background story: I’ve been with my sons dad, my dude for a little over a year. It’s been rocky to say the least (i’m sure you gathered that from my posts right?) but nonetheless I fell in love with him in a way I never knew I could … never expected to, never wanted to, never thought would happen. I’ve gone from never wanting to be in love with another guy, to not knowing how I lived without this one … perfect right? Yep, EXCEPT almost over night he went from sleeping beside me every night to living like 4000 odd miles away, or maybe just under.
Lord of Chaos (WoT 6) by Robert Jordan -- 200 out of 986 (I finished my rereading portion and now there's no more rereading for me. This is a great series, I've just had to learn to appreciate the journey and not worry too much about the endgame.)

These diy reusable bowl covers from The Farm Chicks are just brilliant. Sometimes I get tired of wrestling with plastic wrap. And the sewing instructions are simple enough that even I can make these. I think.
So I staggered back to the town of “GOD” and after a lovely walk along the river Wey chasing a swan invigorated by the thought to take a photo of it and a disheartening experience of feeling too pushed about by busy locals to be able to take in Godalming’s cosy town centre I decided to take the train back a couple of hours earlier than planned and to stop for lunch in Brighton instead.
Boaz Yakim handles the action really well but he script seems lost in the confusion created by the bloody mayhem, fast escapes and even faster car chases. Yakim lets the “Gun-do-the-talking” and frequent gunshots, partially replace the conversation. One might accuse Statham, of being an actor with limited emotions, but when it comes to action, the man is the best we have. Chan, in her first film puts up an endearing act.

With block constructed, you need to make a deck with only cards from a specific block. All cards from that block are legal, including special and promotional cards.

I first moved to the bay area in 1997. I was burned out at college, so I took a semester off and moved in with some friends in a house in Oakland. Before I went back east to spend my last year in college, I swore I would move back here when I was done. One year, one month, and one day later, I was back.
On the heels of the very disappointing April jobs report released by the BLS I thought it would be interesting to look at some jobs that are slightly out of the mainstream.

“Over the past few weeks I’ve written about subprime lenders and how their demise will hurt the U.S. housing market, the economy and the stock market. There’s no escaping the carnage headed our way because the housing market and subprime business are falling apart. The worst of our problems, because of the easy money made available to borrowers, which fueled the housing boom that peaked in 2005, have yet to arrive.”

I would say the best books out there for age 10 and up featuring trolls are by Katherine Langrish, an expert in folklore and medieval studies who also has an excellent blog. Her trilogy—Troll Fell, Troll Mill, and Troll Blood—begins when Peter Ulfsson is orphaned and sent to live with his horrible uncles, Baldur and Grim, who would be more than a match for James' aunts Spiker and Sponge in Dahl's well-known book. Turns out Peter's uncles are planning to sell human children to the trolls who live under the mountain in exchange for gold. Three troll books worth looking for!

When we were at Anthro (see number 2), he found this book called "Books Make a Home"! He joked that he authored it under a different name. How funny is that? We had a good laugh in Anthro about that. I'm sure people wondered what was so funny about a book about books!
I was definitely a little leery of the passion fruit things, but I gave them a try, and they were pretty okay. I’m not sure I loved them enough to seek them out (like those pumpkin seeds…Leah, where did you get those anyway?!?) but I certainly didn’t spit them out.

Let’s connect the dots with talent analytics. The moment that one of our senior managers reads one of our well-researched, completely revolutionary, information-packed decks on human capital, it’s possible that we are setting that executive up to fail. While they are reading and absorbing the new numbers, they are making decisions . But which part of them is making that decision? The rational side or the emotional side? Particularly with talent decisions, where a manager may be more emotionally tied to a decision, it may be difficult – physically difficult – for a leader to make a decision based on loads of data. While they are absorbing data in the frontal lobe, the decision is being made… by the emotional centers of the brain.

Growing up, El Paso was an absolute hotbed for XC talent. The amount of team and individual state medals won is staggering. We ran hard with the aim to win, but we also wanted our neighbors to experience the same success. Teams who had been to the big show (State Meet) mentored younger teams, pulled them along. My team, Eastwood, got a lot of good advice from defending Regional and State champs El Paso High before we went on to win our own Regional title. I'd like to think we did the same thing for Hanks when they succeeded us as Regional Champs.

The original Parasol’s Roast Beef Po’Boy, which Tracey’s apparently serves, was actually more of a boiled beef sandwich. The new Parasol’s one is absolutely made from fresh roasted beef, seasoned with garlic and other spices, with real gravy drippings. It’s actually better than the original, in my opinion.
Good MORNING everyone! Just a casual life update. Last night was Relay for Life at Virginia Tech. For those of you who do not know what that means, it is an all-night marathon of donating for the American Cancer Society. The goal -- to create more birthdays and honor those who are fighting the battle, lost the battle, or have beat cancer. Raising awareness and donations are the biggest drivers in eliminating cancer.

Now there's a blog title you probably don't run across everyday! For those of you who are fairly new to my blog, my husband and I spent two weeks in Europe last summer. We were in Paris, Prague, the French Alps and back to Paris before returning home. We went for a few big "bucket list" items--seeing the final stage of the Tour de France was one. I've already shared those pages with you, as well as our first few days in Paris. Today I'm going to share some pages of being in Prague, Czech Republic. Now you're probably wondering...why Prague? Well...let me tell you! I have a good friend that I met here in my city that I call home. She's Czech and though she lives in my city most of the year, she stays in the CR much of the summer. I always wanted to see where she was from, so when we decided to go to France, well...we figured we were almost there so we might as well see Prague, too. A quick and very cheap plane flight later and we were visiting our friends! I have to tell you...it was very surreal seeing them--there.

I don't know where this information will go but sometimes I find myself typing things I"d rather not have to type. I recall having to look up a word not too long a go that was scratched on something and it was a very embarrassing definition.
Weakness: Notre Dame’s short bench will be an issue. They’ve been able to get away with for most of the season, but it’s guaranteed to rear its ugly head in the tournament. There will be a team that presses the Irish or one of the Irish’s key players will get into foul trouble. When this happens, how will the Irish react?
In my own regiment, the Royal Irish, this feeling of clan identity is important: men would rather die than be thought of as shirkers. When one of my soldiers expressed doubt about crossing the border into Iraq in March 2003, I agreed it might be better for him to remain behind. I had already said that I wanted no man by my side who did not want to be there. With Sir Colin Campbell’s threat at Sevastopol to “post the name of any man that ran on the door of his kirk” in mind, I warned the men that it would be on their mothers queuing at the Co-op that the real shame would fall. It was the soldier’s brother and his friends in the battalion who insisted that he go, to protect the regiment and the family’s honour; one and the same. And so he went.

In the dictionary, worldview is defined as “A particular philosophy of life or conception of the world”. Our goal, then, is to help our kids develop a worldview that is Christ-centered, or a Christian worldview. We want them to journey forth with a Scriptural mindset, so that they will not only not be surprised by the state of the world, they will be prepared to address it with Scriptural solutions. How is this accomplished?
In any case, today, May 1, 2012, offers people everywhere the opportunity to become educated, or to protest income inequality; to observe the Celtic ushering in of summer, or to honor the goddesses of fertility—to name just a few of today’s holidays. So go out and DO IT!
The theme is "favourite holiday", and I have chosen Easter. I love Easter - we always spend it at my Mum an Dad's and there are usually lots of lambs to feed and play with, as well as the Easter Egg Hunt, a bus rally for the hubby and a bit of a rest for me LOL!!

I was the only customer in the newly refurbished international bank in my home town last week. Yes I still have an account, they told me after tapping in my numbers, but it's no longer valid. The balance left there in January 2009 of trillions, or was it quadrillions, is gone - apparently eaten up by devaluation and ledger fees, not converted to 'real' US dollar money. A new account number has been allocated to me, the bank said but it's dormant and requires a deposit of 20 US dollars to bring it to life. No, the bank say, the money left in my account doesn't qualify to activate the new account, you must deposit REAL money they insist. Once this has been done I enquire about a cheque book - oh no we haven't got any yet I'm told. And an ATM card - oh please, what planet am I on to be asking such an insane question!

It's understood that at 31, and soon to turn 32, the days Brad Eldred is considered a major league prospect have come and gone. He was signed strictly to help at Triple-A Toledo. The Tigers would have to add him to their 40-man roster to bring him the major leagues. If he got to the major leagues, it's highly unlikely he'd do much. He has hit only .204, with some power, but a loads of strikeouts, in three previous brief major league stints, the last in 2010. Listed at 6-foot-6 and 270 pounds, Eldred is the 4-A version of Adam Dunn.

Each rosette is created by scoring a strip of paper or card stock at equal distances then simply accordion fold, connect the ends, press down in the center and secure. The height of the rosette is controlled by the distance of the scores. 1/4" scores will make a rosette 1/4" tall, 1/2" scores will create a rosette that is 1/2" tall etc. The diameter of the rosette is controlled by the width of the paper strip. The wider the paper the larger the rosette.

2. CHANEL Coco Mademoiselle- CHANEL No. 5 eau de parfum is the first great abstract perfume, N°5 conjures up no precise floral scent and survives the passing of mere trends because it is beyond them. Coco CHANEL wanted “a woman’s fragrance that smells like Woman.” When perfume designer Ernest Beaux presented her with his 5th composition, the choice seemed simple and obvious.
(Sony Classics) Greta Gerwig, Adam Brody, Analeigh Tipton, Aubrey Plaza. A group of fashionistas at a college take a new girl under their wings in order to teach her their somewhat unorthodox ways of helping people who they deem are in need of it. When the new girl is pursued by a young man, it sets off a chain of events that will change the dynamic of the girls and maybe – just maybe – give them an entirely new viewpoint on life.
To Ferguson’s hand-motion to indicate that Mancini was talking too much at the officials the City manager mocked him by mimicking the gesture, and the Scot’s cheeks flushed purple at the liberty. If this was a snapshot of power shifting across town, Mancini’s response when told that Ferguson accused him of “haranguing” the officials throughout City’s 1-0 win was as telling. “Him? Me? Him? Who said this? Him, no? H e doesn’t talk with the referee or the fourth official? No, never,” he joked. Refusing to take an opponent seriously is a message about where potency lies.
Hillary Clinton has been more circumspect about her Alinsky experience. When her husband became President, she had her thesis sealed and, even now, it can only be read on the Wellesley campus.

By bringing visitors into our business in order to raise awareness of our work, it helps our trainees develop their communication skills and to break down barrier they may have had when dealing with social situations. We regularly sit with the trainees and dissect the week and the thing that strikes me most are the heart-warming comments that come from the trainees. One of our ladies is overcoming so much and the leaps and bounds she’s making has even spilled into her home life – Her mother commented that she “could see a change in her” and that she was “so proud” of her and that, of course, meant the world to our trainee.
It is well-documented — and grudgingly admitted by the press themselves — that journalists in Norway as well as in neighboring Sweden and Denmark are considerably more left-leaning in their ideological views and political sympathies than is true of the general population. In fact, judged by the data I have seen, this strong left-wing media bias exists throughout most of the Western world, not just in the Scandinavian or Nordic countries. If this allegation is correct, this represents a major systemic problem for Western societies.
Being apart of the Mighty Fine Blog Tour was great! After the movie we had a Q & A time with the director. She told us they filmed in 17 days, struggled with New Orleans black mold and hurricane season! Chazz Palminteri and Jodelle Ferland also chatted with us. I didn't even think of taking a screen shot but I did take 2 pictures with my cell phone! Here are the pictures and a few points from the movie from the actors.
Anyway, I would like to greet this new month with a brief rundown of what has turned out to be a very exciting month of August. There was, of course, the Willamette Writers conference and all its good energy, followed by the heady days of WriteOnCon. Which spilled over into Queryland, where I now have four agents reading my complete manuscript.

Not much of a social magnet I was mostly living life by myself and had only a few friends. My interests were movies and music and books and I often did feel as if life was going on around me but I wasn’t a part of it. Often I didn’t even understand it, and thought of myself as stranded in an alien world I couldn’t make sense of. Much like Howard in the movie.
That said, my trip round the Senat was now several weeks ago, and I've lost the handy thingy they gave out at the end with information. So, this may be a slightly more skant version of the blog post I had been intending to write. I know this disappoints you. I'm sorry. (Or, I would be sorry, but I've just come back from holiday, so I don't actually care. But I can pretend, just for you. Yes, I will share the photos and write that up too - maybe even this very evening, if you're lucky. You probably won't be.)

My step dad reached over lifting the line and grabbed the eel. Walking over to the other side of the pier, he laid it down and knelt as he pulled out his knife.

“You know, I can’t find it,” said Hermel. “Why don’t some of you guys try,” he said. Everyone took their turn but no one could find it. And so Hermel decided there was no way except to find Bernie, who had opened the secret door for them the first time. Back up the ladder they all went. Back to the Rat’s Den went Hermel with Hornmel. Everyone else warmed up by the fireplace at the Guild Hall and waited.

In the scheme of things, Afghan politics are not played out within the actual borders that none of the players actually recognise, but on a far wider tableau, which takes in the ambitions and aspirations of all the neighbouring states, the former state of Baluchistan (now absorbed into Pakistan and Iran), and of course, the great regional elephant in the room, India.
