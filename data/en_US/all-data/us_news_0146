Its hard drive was the keeper of all of your information, from photos to music to financial records.

Physicians who care for such women have learned that those given the opportunity to learn about fertility preservation feel a renewed sense of hope at a time when their world has been turned upside down. Fertility preservation provides young women a chance to look forward to their future and to plan for something beyond cancer treatment.

Looking at a wine can tell you how young or old it is, what temperature the climate was, how rich the flavor will be, and much more. Whites are actually yellow or silver. Young whites from cooler climates with high tartness factors and citrus aromas appear silver, and at the extreme have a green hue. Any variation on this tells you that the wine has aged more, that it's from a warmer climate or that it's a touch more complex. More robust whites, such as those made from Chardonnay grapes, are white-gold to yellow-gold when young. If a white is a deep yellow-gold with no green, it was most likely produced in a sunny area and aged more in oak. Young whites (1-5 years old) have less color. As they age, they become deeper golds that eventually head into amber.

Talk about a bad slice. Metro's plan to build a $10.6 million golf course and "learning center" at Blue Lake Regional Park went flying off into the financial rough this winter when it became apparent the project wouldn't succeed because of the recession.

But I didn't realize what was going on until I had two outs in the ninth."

Steven Lenhart’s reputation. Olave and referee Elias Bazakos should have known better. Lenhart had just one plan when he raced for the ball in the 69th minute of San Jose’s game vs. RSL on Saturday and everybody but the hulking defender and the official knew it. Lenhart grabbed Olave’s shorts, leaned to his left and flopped to the turf. Bazakos, who must have skipped the scouting report on the opportunistic Earthquakes forward, presented Olave with a red card for denying a goal scoring opportunity. The defender would’ve been better off easing up and letting Lenhart take his chances against RSL goalkeeper Nick Rimando.

— Toward the end of the Cindy Sherman retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, a flat-screen monitor plays "Doll Clothes," one of the artist's earliest works. The two-minute, black-and-white stop-motion animation was made in 1975, when Sherman was an undergraduate at Buffalo State College.

After putting it on, she begins to explore the more fully dimensional realm of objects atop a dresser until an anonymous hand reaching in from off-screen plucks her out of her newfound reverie and puts her back in her appointed slot — captive, dependent and inert once again.

The rest of the meal is from the small, two-page menu. The best item is the Kushi oysters and cream onion soup ($12) appetizer. The oysters are lighter and more delicate, both in texture and taste, than heartier, more commonplace oysters. But, good as the oysters are, especially when paired on your spoon with the clean-tasting sea beans, what steals the show is the soup. Poured into your bowl table-side, the aroma is as warm and sweet as a summer day. But the brilliance of this silky soup is how it enhances the briny taste of the oysters, which, in turn, highlight the gentle sweetness of the soup. It's a marriage made in heaven.
Here's what I found myself dwelling on when things weren't humming after two dinner visits and one at lunch. The dining room and its attached bar, appreciated as a whole, are gorgeous and uplifting, but up close, the wooden tables are unattractive and the table settings feel bare and under-considered. And in what could be the one of the city's most elegant gathering spots, the music selection is a steady diet of dusty hits from the late 1990s.

This logic didn't work in 1789, and it won't work in 2011.

Polian on Richardson: "He's got incredible skills, skills that are comparable to Emmitt Smith. But he's incredibly fast. In addition to that, he has a fire and drive that not only gain yards but ignites your football team. People like to play with him.

Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister): His favorite scene is at the end of Season No. 1 with Ned Stark's widow, Catelyn (where he sort of propositions her in a nasty way and she whacks him on the head with a rock).

It's part of our five-year plan and includes filmmakers as well. It's part of expanding the global connection to international artists. Our exhibitions also focus and shape where we're going. We have support of a Mellon Foundation grant to understand what it means to have textiles to document, store and archive. That's a challenge.

The poached octopus ($8.75) is a signature dish among the 31 small plates. While tapas -- and everything associated with small-plate dining -- has become the rage during the past few years, the folks at Zarzuela continue to work the stove with the best of them, and the prices are among the most reasonable.

Unlike a previous version of the DISCLOSE Act that included restrictions on political activity by government contractors and corporations with foreign ownership, Van Hollen's is all about timely disclosure. It would require unions, corporations, super PACs and other organizations that spend $10,000 or more on a "campaign-related disbursement" to disclose their donors to the Federal Election Commission within 24 hours.

Sherpa says: I'm not sure what "perfect" barbecue looks like, but I'm sure Pappy's ribs are as close as it gets. Of course, they have that smoky pink ring of succulent pork on the inside, but it is the crisp, rich bark on the outside that is even more special.

Bonuses: friendly service and the perfect barbecue-joint ambience - clean and neat, but relaxed and informal.

Like many Korean markets in the United States, Kukje produces some of the jarred kimchi on its store shelves. In a spacious room in the back of the store, two Korean women with plastic-gloved hands prepare about 120 gallons a week of whole-cabbage kimchi, so called because the cabbage heads are not chopped. Instead, they are halved lengthwise, brined overnight, then rinsed, squeezed dry and stuffed with a spicy seasoning mixture.

These three actors have great chemistry, and that plus the energy generated by all the movement makes the dance of their interactions magic to watch. When characters from the little town come into the motel room (Kurt Conroyd as Steve, Lorraine Bahr as Mrs. Wood, Kirsten Martz as Angie, Ed Edmo as Abenaki), they help create the climactic moments that arrive in scenes of sex and brutality, and the energy level reaches a roiling pitch.

This approach could be applied to violent individuals as well. Instead of trying to arrest all dealers indiscriminately, law enforcement could identify the most violent dealers, warn them that if they don't stop right away they are headed to prison, and focus on putting away as many as possible of those who don't quit. That wouldn't shrink the supply of drugs, but it might reduce street violence.
A number of Ravens have charitable foundations and make appearances, but Webb is one of the youngest players to take on such an active role. This summer, he held a free football camp for 300 kids. In October, the Lardarius Webb Foundation hosted a charity bowling event to raise money for underprivileged families. At Thanksgiving, he helped teammate Ben Grubbs provide Thanksgiving dinner for those who couldn't afford it. He's hosting an American Idol-themed karaoke party this month to raise money for cancer research, and he and his teammates will take turns behind the microphone.

But along with these hard-working folks come criminals who take advantage of them and bring violence to our state. It is the job of law enforcement to investigate and prosecute these criminals.

"In its philosophy and practice, the military justice system is masking a major consequence of its sentencing procedures, which civilian courts have learned over the last two decades: Incarceration without adequate mental treatment leads to repeat offenses at a rate so alarming and harmful to society that it has created a `national public health crisis' of `epidemic' proportion," Seamone writes.

SPRING HILL, Tenn. (AP) - An atheist group has awarded a $1,000 scholarship to a Spring Hill high school student who dressed up as Jesus Christ for Fictional Character Day.
The movie "21" has turned out to one of the hits of this not-too-impressive springtime movie season. It's been promoted as based on the true story of Massachusetts Institute of Technology students who took their math braniac skills to the Vegas blackjack tables. The movie's pretty entertaining, with Vegas high-life atmosphere, insiderish info about counting cards, and a starmaking performance by swoonworthy young star Jim Sturgess. But how true is it? Er, um, well, according to a recent Boston Globe story, the movie's source, "Bringing Down the House," added more than a few embellishments to its supposedly nonfiction account. Author Ben Mezrich changed names, created composite characters and included incidents that, according to the Globe story, don't match up with accounts by the real MIT students involved. Mezrich says his books include disclaimers about the liberties he takes with certain details. Gay Talese, the influential nonfiction author, is quoted in the Globe story saying, "There's an art to nonfiction, but the art isn't the creative license one might take as a fiction writer."

After seeing unexpected spikes in claims, the Ohio Insurance Institute compared hail storm damage estimates after a 2007 Akron hailstorm to the insurance claims filed. The industry estimated it would see $105 million in claims, but instead insurance claims topped $288 million.

Oregon State losing 2 in a row and to WSU – are they done?... This swoon isn't due to a lack of talent, or the loss of James Rodgers. There's something wrong with the soul of this team. Their will was broken in the losses to Washington and UCLA, and they mailed it in against Washington State. I feel for Jacquizz Rodgers, who continues to play hard, but he doesn't have enough around him right now. They look headed to a 0-5 finish to the season. The only question is, whether they'll roll over in the Civil War or decide to try to play spoiler.
The defense budget grew from $316 billion in 2001 to $708 billion in 2011. Federal spending on homeland security, which includes everything from airport security to border control, also rose dramatically. Last year dozens of federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, spent $70 billion on such programs, according to the Office of Management and Budget. That's up from $37 billion in 2003, the first year after DHS was formed.
The debate revealed what the public cannot have failed to notice in a long election campaign: The two men have polar opposite views of how to deal with just about everything. They butt heads over how to counter the effects of the global economic crisis — Hollande supports higher taxes and encouraging growth, Sarkozy austerity cuts and savings — how to lower an unemployment rate that hovers just under 10%, an 11-year high, and how to reduce public debt that has seen France lose its triple-A credit rating.
A JetBlue spokeswoman attributed the incident, which began more than three hours into the flight, to "a medical situation involving the captain."

Koschman also was "occasionally moving spontaneously," so doctors restrained him to keep him from dislodging the lines and tubes helping keep him alive, hooking him to the ventilator, brain monitor and IV.
The Beastie Boys and the Red Hot Chili Peppers are, in many ways, parallel acts. Both emerged from underground punk scenes in the early eighties -- the Beasties in New York City, and the Chili Peppers in Southern California. Both groups of musicians are laddish, mischievous, and ultimately endearing. Both bands made their best-selling albums with Rick Rubin, a producer who brings a metal edge to funky recording acts. The Chili Peppers draw heavily from hip-hop; the Beasties put the first hip-hop album on the top of the Billboard 200. When Adam Yauch needed some extra muscle for his first Tibetan Freedom Concert, it was the Red Hot Chili Peppers he called in.

Colson, 80, is a giant of our time. He is a reminder of the true meaning of redemption, a concept that has been debased in our Tilt-a-Whirl media culture that can't distinguish between notoriety and fame. In contemporary America, redemption begins sometime between the first check-in into rehab and the first cable-TV interview, and reaches completion when everyone gets distracted by someone else's attention-grabbing disgrace.

I’m surprised by my sudden change of heart as anyone; I hadn’t been a real Jermaine fan till this performance. I blame the song choice.

The complaint about "Boardwalk Empire" having too many characters and too many narrative lines in the water is accurate and unfair. It's accurate because this show makes "The Sopranos" looks like "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" There are more characters than "The Great Race" or "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" or one of those movies with so many featured performances their head shots were lined up at the bottom of the poster. It's unfair because most of the characters on "Boardwalk Empire" are fascinating people, historical and fictional, who more than justify their time onscreen. The only problem is finding time for all of them. Chalky White (played by the great Michael K. Williams)? Richard Harrow (Jack Huston)? Arnold Rothstein (Michael Stuhlbarg)? Esther Randolph (Julianne Nicholson)? Bring them on!
