If you look at Pura Vida's entrance straight on from Public Square, you would hardly know it's there, occupying an old May Co. storefront. Approach it from either direction on Euclid Avenue to see the restaurant's sign, sort of. I mention this because Chef Brandt Evans' new place should have its name up in lights -- big, twinkling, playful lights, to match the food on the plate. Evans has joined Michael Symon, Jonathon Sawyer and Zack Bruell in adding to the important critical mass of culinary talent in the East Fourth Street neighborhood. The chef has embraced the small-plates concept for both lunch and dinner, but also has a wide selection of entrees. Lunch and dinner deliver their own enchantments. A creamy, Old Bay spiced shrimp and corn chowder at lunch had the distinct flavors of both ingredients plus a velvety texture. Peanut stew with big chunks of sweet potatoes in a sweet-sharp creamy base was a decadent delight. The warm spinach salad at lunch was a meal in itself, with a fried local egg atop fresh leaves, and a party of flavors over that: candied pecans, crispy bacon and shallot chunks and pickled onion. And the Laughing Bird shrimp "fried rice" dinner entree with pineapple, napa cabbage, Carribbean jerk bamboo rice and grilled scallion was a perfect cross-cultural mix of savory and sweet. -- with Laura Demarco, Plain Dealer Reporter

They made a lot of nice pictures that way. Sure, they dressed weird and could be awfully temperamental, but who are we to talk? Newspaper photographers were magicians. They'd disappear into mysterious red-lit darkrooms, places full of 'soup" and "fixer" and bad words, but when they came out, one or more of the images on all that Kodak film would be pure genius.

Meanwhile, purely by chance, I ran into former Raiders coach Jon Gruden while waiting for an elevator here at the Orange Bowl headquarters hotel. He'll be part of the Orange Bowl television crew on ESPN. We exchanged "It's been a while" pleasantries and then I asked the natural question: Have the 49ers contacted him about their head coaching opening? Gruden indicated that had not happened and said, "I don't even know what's really going on" with many of the coaching vacancies for which his name has been floated.

This is an album where I'm expressing a lot of my feelings toward the culture of hip-hop, how it's gone so far left. There was a point in time, to be in the music industry you had to have true skills as an artist. You had to say something. There had to be a meaning behind your message. In the era of hip-hop today, that doesn't exist anymore. It's like you can say whatever you want and it doesn't have to make any sense."

That shadow is Gainsbourg's Jewish identity personified. We meet Lucien "Serge" Gainsbourg (played as an adult by Eric Elmosnino) during World War II, when French collaborators help the Nazis round up and deport Jews. But the boy embraces his Jewishness, as represented by a pair of big-nosed costumed characters that follow him from art school (where he shamelessly flirts with an older nude model) to the swingin' '60s nightclub scene (where he writes lascivious songs for young pop starlets).

A foodscape has erupted from the urban landscape as San Franciscans seek to connect with locally grown food, seasonal rhythms and something else that San Francisco wants to nurture - a sense of community, shared purpose, common goals and neighborhood pride.

Plan B: Farther south, the Grenadines unfurl from the southern tip of St. Vincent like tassels ornamenting the tail of a kite, an archipelago of secret landings, many reached only by sea.

The Tobago Cays are a quintet of uninhabited outcrops fringed with pearlescent sand and snorkel-ready reefs. With 5,000 residents, Bequia is the most populated Grenadine, with sweet bays overlooked by inexpensive inns.

MARK SPENCER: In this case, the woman's complaint would not be valid under the requirements of the statute. If the department involved has a policy in place that interfered, restricted or prohibited an officer from having discretionary contact with federal immigration authorities when there is reasonable suspicion that a person lawfully contacted is in the country illegally, the department could be held liable. The statute protects individual officers against lawsuits for exercising discretion in their interaction with ICE.

With the stunning end to Maryland's General Assembly, many have opined of the need to raise the gas tax in the anticipated special session ("Baltimore gets stranded," April 17). Supporters state that the "business community" overwhelmingly favors such an increase. Notably, many in the "business community" that favor the gas tax represent businesses that do not actually own vehicles. As a representative of the trucking industry which delivers the food, clothing, medicine and other goods Marylanders use, I can tell you that such support among businesses is hardly universal.
Bergelson also admits that she's just getting to know Gilbert. That's also true for many New Yorkers, as well as others around the classical music world who are barely acquainted with this quiet-mannered 42-year-old conductor who is the first native New Yorker to lead the Philharmonic. He isn't the subject of the kind of volcanic media eruption that the 28-year-old Dudamel's rags-to-raves story has created since the Los Angeles Philharmonic named him its next music director, but Gilbert's welcoming, boyish face smiles from bright red promotional ads on New York buses.

King George VI's tortured path to becoming an inspirational speaker, which is the dramatic heart of the movie, did not come from a desire to fortify his political status (he was, after all, king) or to launch a lucrative side career on the lecture circuit.

The commission said that in one case, an electrical fault caused by plant workers made the reactor and half of the control room indicators shut down and triggered safety systems that actual plant conditions did not justify. In another instance, a water pump that cools safety equipment failed, the result of a crack in one of the couplings that hold together rods in the cooling system. The same failure happened in 2009, and the commission said an inspection showed the plant had not done enough to prevent a recurrence.

If he is doing those things, we want to keep Greg around. I don’t feel like I’m ready to give up on Greg Oden. I don’t think anybody in our organization is ready.

They don't want to touch anything paper. They want everything through their iPhone and Android. They want their credit card on their phone. They don't want to touch anything that's not fast and easy. And that's a good thing - don't get me wrong.

Campaigns are built on risk, and the governor's political team might deem it too risky for Jerry Brown to return to his old no-nonsense self. But considering that Brown was a Jesuit seminarian before following his father's path to Sacramento, one wonders what this governor's inner Ignatian is telling him: Better to seek a dishonest advantage, or preach a more honest gospel?

The business model developed in St. Louis was replaced by a model shipped in from Sao Paulo, Brazil, home to AmBev, the InBev subsidiary that owns the Brazilian market.

AmBev also was the training ground for many of the company's current leaders, including Brito and North American zone president Luiz Edmond, the seldom-heard-from top A-B InBev executive in St. Louis.

As for natural Christmas trees, Connolly recommends watering the pines twice a day. Personally, he wouldn't have them in his own house, however. The fire danger is too great, he said.

In that time, the Secret Service came in the restaurant, did the necessary security sweeps and strung yellow caution tape outside the restaurant. The patrons who were in the restaurant were allowed to stay.
Later, legislative leaders sued Chiang, challenging his authority, and Judge Brown declared, in essence, that the Legislature is the sole judge as to whether its budget was balanced, thus confirming that the salary penalty was just a political ploy to persuade voters to pass a ballot measure eliminating the two-thirds vote requirement on budgets.
Train, who had one of the year's top songs with "Soul Sister" but found themselves shut out of contention for song or album of the year, got a major consolation prize Sunday as they took home a trophy for best pop performance by a duo or group with vocals for the live version of their ubiquitous song.

Meanwhile, Emanuela's grandmother says the little girl has finished chemo and is doing well. Emanuela's uncle didn't want to talk about the made-for-TV drama at the benefit: "I'd rather leave it alone and let it die out. It's too much drama. It's a sad situation." And Emanuela's parents on their website thanked the Brownstone and the Manzo family "for putting Emanulea's benefit over the differences that they have with Danielle. As she make her appearance we hope the Babies best interest is at heart!"

Signed to write original music and lyrics, Wright and Forrest remained at the studio seven years.
While Luisa looks to God for help, namely in the form of a young priest, Antonio (Daniel Bruehl), John turns to the police and surveillance technologies. These mirrored solutions appear equally dubious and bring with them another nice doubling in the form of an old priest, who labels Luisa crazy, and a therapist (Kerry Fox), who says the same of John. Although Fresnadillo's toggling between the two families initially feels overly brusque and narratively unearned, the connective tissue between their stories (like the priest and therapist) thickens until it all feels of a piece, which of course it is. And while the sympathetic Owen and Purnell encourage you to worry more about one family, Fresnadillo and his love of the dark keep you jumping no matter where you are.

But attitudes are shifting, and there is a growing acceptance of same-sex unions. In the past year, almost every major poll has shown that a slim majority now supports them as a right. That overall support, however, masked a deep partisan divide. Democrats overwhelmingly supported gay marriage, by 64 to 32 percent, and independents by a narrower 54 to 42 percent. Republicans opposed it, by 57 to 39 percent.

Barbara Geisman fought that hollowing out for years. She was, until retiring this month, the deputy mayor for development in the city of St. Louis, which in the past decade has given out $585 million in TIF and issued property tax abatements on thousands of properties.

Jimenez threw 105 pitches in 4 2/3 innings in a 7-2 loss to the White Sox.

The Department of Transportation's new rule, which goes into effect April 29, orders airlines to let passengers off planes delayed for three hours or face hefty fines.

WASHINGTON  Two months ago, it looked as though Rick Santorum might somehow pull off an upset.

They mostly do. Actually, although Bale has been drawing the most attention, his work as Micky’s brother Dickie — a clowning crack addict — seems the most obvious, a flashy collection of faces. Exaggerated and eccentric, it’s the kind of job only an Oscar voter could love.
This has been a difficult year for the Klines - or, more properly, for the Professional Theatre Council, the organization that presents the awards.

When Marian Gaborik scored with 5 minutes, 19 seconds left in the third overtime, giving the Rangers a 2-1 victory in the longest game of this NHL postseason and a two-games-to-one lead in the series, it was surprising that he and his teammates had any energy left to celebrate. The game was New York's longest in any postseason since April 29, 1971—when Pete Stemkowski scored after 41:29 of extra time to beat the Chicago Blackhawks, 3-2—and it ended a seven-game losing streak for the Rangers in playoff overtime games.

Now comes Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., with a comparable contribution to another debate, the one concerning government regulation of political speech. Joined by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, 26 other Democrats and one Republican, he proposes a constitutional amendment to radically contract First Amendment protections. His purpose is to vastly expand government's power -- i.e., the power of incumbent legislators -- to write laws regulating, rationing or even proscribing speech in elections that determine the composition of the legislature and the rest of the government. McGovern's proposal vindicates those who say most campaign-finance "reforms" are incompatible with the First Amendment.

Both of the return jobs are filled right now for the Giants, but Blackmon could have an impact there.

Girl, 13, faces gang charge
Starting pitching and closer. The Royals' young pitching has not caught up to their hitting talent yet. They don't have a true ace and they will be relying on inconsistent and unproven starters. Bruce Chen is the veteran leader, but the other four projected starters (Luke Hochevar, Jonathan Sanchez, Felipe Paulino, Danny Duffy) had a combined record of 23-36 last year. Closer Joakim Soria had season-ending Tommy John surgery, so ninth-inning duties will fall to a trio of former Dodgers closer Jonathan Broxton, former first-round pick Aaron Crow or last season's dominant setup man, Greg Holland.

The thinking of many personnel executives around the league is Manning simply lifts any team that signs him significantly if his health allows him to play anywhere close to full strength.
