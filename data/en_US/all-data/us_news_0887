I know that having to defend against them, they were a real challenge to defend.

Annie Clark goes surprisingly punk on this track she recorded for Record Store Day, spewing f-words and giving you danger on a distorted electric guitar. Even if you factor in the grittier approach she took to one of last year's best albums, "Strange Mercy," or that No Wave reinvention of a Pop Group song she uncorked at the Crescent last October, the reckless abandon she brings to this track is sure to leave most listeners in a state of shock.

Compare that to 2008, when ripe and gorgeous wines were in abundance in the mid-13s, more typical for Oregon's northern climes.

This place would drive ol' King Ludwig crazy. And not just because it has a sprawling mural of Neuschwanstein Castle, the Bavarian Disneyland where the monarch lost his mind while listening to Wagner. Der Braumeister, you see, serves 120 brews, including a ton of Bavarian wheat beers. But it's the Old World vibe of the place that reminds me of a recent beer-hall hop in Deutschland. Check out the army of nutcrackers, large and small, guarding the place like determined little soldiers. Or the hearty German menu. Or the countless vintage beer signs, pastoral paintings, steins and bric-a-brac all over die joint. Or the summery Biergarten out front. Now listen to that oompah-band CD playing in the bar. Tell me you aren't hypnotized.

Larry Schade, owner of Kaufmann Poultry, wants the city to re-illuminate the market's clock tower and repair the clock, which rises over West 25th and Lorain. Those repairs, he says, are the least the city can do to reward vendors who bring diversity and recognition of Cleveland.

The repayments will be deducted from future pension benefits - up to a maximum of 25 percent of a pension payment. For those who have been overpaid, that will result in a "huge double-whammy," said Rebecca Davis, legislative counsel for the Washington, D.C.-based Pension Rights Center.
It's hard to say which is the movie within the movie, since the action skips back and forth between the contemporary production unit and the period piece being produced. And it's tempting to say that the period piece is just as silly in its way as the one in "Singin' In the Rain." But it isn't. The unexpected -- though surely not unintended -- consequence of Michael Winterbottom's scheme is our involvement in both levels of this split-level film. We know it's only a movie -- about a movie. Yet we're caught up by the harrowing drama of Tristram's birth and whatever flows from it, including the question of whether the producers can afford Gillian Anderson, whose salary would exceed the cost of staging the 1695 siege at Namur, where Tristram's Uncle Toby was inconveniently if not grievously injured. Only a movie indeed.

To rein in expenses, Essex reduced overtime at the jail, knocking $800,000 off 2008’s $4.2 million tab by reducing overtime by 5,082 hours. The $3.4 million in overtime, though, was still higher than 2007’s $2.1 million but lower than every other county of similar size other than Camden’s.

After Shane Hollett's 16-year first marriage ended, he thought carefully about what he had done wrong in the relationship and realized he had married too young—at age 23, before he understood what commitment really means. And he had married someone with whom he had little in common. She was meek and liked to stay home with the kids; he has a forceful personality and likes to go out. "Her personality wasn't equal to mine in strength," says Mr. Hollett, 63, a fundraiser for the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland. "I knew I controlled the situation, and I manipulated her."

-- Sept. 30-Nov. 13 -- The 16th Epcot International Food & Wine Festival starts on Sept. 30 and continues through Nov. 13 at Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista. The festival serves up more than 25 international marketplaces featuring tapas-sized culinary creations ($3-$8 each) paired with beers, wines and other beverages.

Many shot blockers are vain, easily tempted by a pump-fake into making a premature jump. Not the 6-10 Davis. He keeps his hands straight up and, with the wingspan of a 7-4 player, is effective even when restrained. He's quick, basketball-smart, and sort of a human warp zone who can casually distort the opponent's offense.
"They put the ball in play and found holes," he said. "He gave up the bomb to Choo and then the home run to Hannahan. Other than that, everything else they hit the ball where we weren't."
Some of the biographical information is funny -- Choyguha is particularly good as she establishes Sharmayne's need for order and discipline, although that, too, is a joke that Hamilton indulges for too long. One of many, actually. The film isn't overly long, just a little more than an hour and a half, but Hamilton spends way too much time on the actual competition. Some of it is interesting enough, but the judges' fanatical attention to detail is played too broadly, and a sameness creeps in.
"You have freak injuries, and this is one of them," Girardi said. "We had a guy carrying a box down the stairs that broke his foot. You can fall off a curb.

The visitors put together a dazzling first period, outshooting the Blackhawks 14-4 and holding them without a shot for a 14-minute stretch. But the offense couldn't convert the chances into a goal, banging three posts and misfiring on a short-handed breakaway by Andy McDonald with 11½ minutes left in the first period.

Abandoning the mangrove, I entered open water, where mullet were jumping so high and so close to my boat that I could feasibly have landed one with some clever maneuvering. I hadn't gotten far into my laissez-faire fishing when I spotted a bald eagle sitting stoically in a tree. Having reached my goal, I turned back, a much easier trip now that I was wise to the tangle of mangroves.
"My first response was, 'Tammie, no. Not now,'" Hurd said. "For the last five years since I moved here, the ladies I know are always trying to set me up. They never see me with a girl. I was thinking this was just another one of those fun times for them, having fun with Lamar."

This was the Toronto pop-rap prince’s second high-profile trip to the Jersey swamps in less than a month: Drake also co-headlined the Bamboozle, the annual punk-rock festival held in the parking lot. He was an anomaly at Bamboozle, but the power-pop crowd loved him anyway; playing in front of a rap crowd, he dispensed with the live band and instead rhymed over a deejay‘s accompaniment. His was a tricky balancing act: he needed to be smooth enough to represent the gorgeous, silken feel of his new album “Thank Me Later,” but rough enough to reach a Hot 97 audience expecting to hear his roughneck Young Money posse cuts. He had help -- first from Young Money CEO Brian “Birdman“ Williams, “the label owner who raps” (if not particularly well), and then from Young Money queen-pin Nicki Minaj, one of the few Summer Jam stars brave enough to rhyme a capella. Minaj is a superb actress and a joy to watch: she’s able to rap and maintain her goofy character without tripping over her words or missing a step.

Ohio State's 98-66 win over the Patriots this evening in front of the home crowd wasn't just a demolition derby on the hardwood, it was a Mr. Universe contest where the Buckeyes flexed the biggest muscle. It wasn't a convincing win, it was a pulverization of the weak.

Remember, he's already living within these limits in ways he isn't contesting, affecting everything from what he eats and drinks, to when he drives, to where he leaves dirty socks. If he wants to go on a spontaneous road trip, crack a noon beer, hang socks on the chandelier and have sex in his own bed, then he's welcome to become fully autonomous. Or at least go to sleep-away college.
The Times released a value-added analysis of about 6,000 L.A. Unified elementary school teachers in August that was based on district data. Before school ends, L.A. Unified plans to release its own analysis, confidentially providing teachers with their individual value-added scores. For at least the first year, the teachers' scores will not be used in formal evaluations; whether they are ultimately used is subject to negotiation with the union.

Woerther, who fought for the last two years to reclassify a piece of land known as the "Slavik property" so that it can't be developed for a big-box retail store, handily beat challenger Ed Marshall on Tuesday.
I expect this new wrinkle to articulate itself in lots of different ways in the coming year. For one, the Retina display very nicely clicks in to an ongoing revolution in typography. Type designers are creating new faces that can take full advantage of super-high-definition displays. Before, "optimizing for the screen" meant dumbing down a type design so that it respects the limitations of display technology. Now, modern typefaces are designed so that they can move from low-resolution phones to Retina-grade tablets to print without any additional tweaking.

More interesting is the oddball romance between Deena and a disturbingly mustachioed Justin Kirk. And most interesting of all are the bonds between Kim, Deena and Laura. If Krysten Ritter didn't already have a TV show, "Life Happens" would offer good material for an adaptation.
Mayor R.T. Rybak's latest proposal to fund a Vikings stadium in downtown Minneapolis would pay for the city's share of the facility by redirecting a group of sales taxes that currently pay for the convention center. That money becomes available when the convention center debt is paid in 2020. Stadium backers argue the sales taxes are state-authorized and therefore not city resources, an argument reflected in the stadium bill introduced Friday.

The Spa at Bernardus, Bernardus Lodge, Carmel Valley: Terra-cotta-hued walls and bucolic vineyards serve as the backdrop for this hideaway where you'll find a Vichy Hamam treatment, in the Turkish tradition, for dehydrated skin and achy muscles (50 minutes; $155). The ritual includes full body exfoliation with a kessa mitt, an olive oil soap scrub, a rejuvenating bucket deluge, and an application of rosewood, mint and patchouli oil - capped off with baklava and a cup of sweet mint tea. For the ultimate moisturizing treatment, try the bourbon vanilla voyage, using sea salt and organic shea butter (50 minutes; $140).
Guessing correctly that the Wellmont would have a large spillover crowd on show nights, he began organizing concerts at the DLV in 2009. There will be another one this Saturday — a Halloween party starring the Porchistas, Essex County Latin-pop standout Deivito and Brooklyn-based Japanese gypsy-rockers Kagero. Shows like these have become traffic-changers: Instead of listeners from New Jersey heading to Manhattan and Brooklyn for entertainment, Gothamites board buses and trains to hear music in the Garden State.

It is used not only for making music (acts as varied as gospel’s Dixie Hummingbirds and ukulele sensation Jake Shimabukuro have recorded there). And there is a minor specialty in recording background music for yoga classes. There’s also voiceover work: Actors Ben Stiller and Jack Black have both recorded parts of movies there.

Chartier's 20-something daughter, Samantha Van Vickle, said her generation perhaps hasn't had enough time to form the kind of hardcore bond with players her father's generation built up from the team's inception in 1960. After all, the south stands were never considered all that loud and rowdy until the Broncos started winning games with regularity in the mid-1970s. Perhaps the fact the Broncos haven't been a Super Bowl team for more than a decade now, with heavy turnover in player personnel the last few years, hasn't helped the younger generation identify with the players.
"People postponed purchases, but the need didn't go away," said Langmack, whose washers clean everything from industrial gaskets to wine bottles. "Now, the need is stronger and people with a little bit of money are buying."
The Washington Street Billy Goat is one of 10 locations listed on the company's website, including the "Original Billy Goat" at 430 N.

An African-American bishop in Philadelphia said Obama's position will make him think twice about supporting the president's re-election. A bed-and-breakfast owner marveled at what he described as the country's progress on gay rights in the past generation. A Florida business owner in a same-sex relationship worried more about the economy and wondered whether Obama's stance was a gimmick. A Kentucky businessman said the president was injecting himself into an issue that should be left to churches.

The typical bladder infection gives rise to pain when passing urine. The bladder calls for frequent emptying, and there's an urgency to empty it when the call of nature sounds. In younger years, intercourse often is a prelude to a bladder infection. At older ages, a laxity in bladder support and a change in the bacteria that surround the urethral opening are the more common causes for infection. The bacterial change occurs when estrogen production falls off.

Some of these schools are about to lose funds formerly used to improve the academic performance of students from low-income families. The school system, however, has changed the way that money is distributed and is instead giving it to schools that serve a higher percentage of low-income students. This shift puts L.A. Unified more in step with federal guidelines on how such Title 1 money is to be used.

Sarah, 20, Santa Clara: If the guy asks you to prom (versus arranging to go as friends) he usually pays. If you feel uncomfortable with that, offer to pay for dinner. Whether he treats or not, unless it's a "friend date," spend most of your time with him. Don't fast dance with the same other guy more than twice, and only slow dance once with someone else. To exceed this is being totally rude.

There is a firmness, almost a stiffness, in the ride, and passengers felt road bumps, big and minor. For example, the test car, with upgraded 18-inch tires, sent through to the passenger compartment vibrations and sounds of manhole covers in the roads.

While all of the savings would draw from the same chunk of the state budget funds allotted for tax relief, Sweeney claims the Democratic proposal puts the focus on middle class families.

No matter which end of the trend you fall on when it comes to choosing to eat more local and seasonal foods, I think more of all of all good - in fact, I think more talk and action around all of it is great. Local foods are fresher, having traveled fewer distances to arrive on our tables, have higher nutrient values having spent less time in transit, they come from local growers who live and work in our economic region and contribute to the health of our communities, and most of all - they taste better. Taking a step toward choosing more foods from local sources couldn't be easier or more delicious than right now.

The moral dimension is missing from the hero, a 17-year-old peasant boy, but not from Louis Malle's profound study of guilt and innocence in occupied France. Lucien, played by Pierre Blaise, is an emotional and cultural infant. Unknown to himself and opaque to those around him, he becomes a Nazi collaborator after being turned down by the French Resistance. A more accessible film on the same subject, "Au Revoir Les Enfants" grew out of Malle's experience as a young student at a private school, on the grounds of a Carmelite monastery, that sheltered Jewish students from Nazi deportation.

Dear Dr. Donohue - My co-worker, 52, has felt bad for about a year. Today he fell from his chair with a loud "boom." He had a seizure and was foaming from the mouth. By the time the ambulance arrived, he was coherent but didn't remember what happened. The emergency-room doctor had several tests done. Nothing was found. What should he do? Whom should he see? - Anon.

What's being twisted, in this case, is the shape of the yield curve. By replacing short-term bonds in its portfolio with longer-term ones, the Fed would be attempting to bring down the long-term interest rates that matter most to homeowners and corporate borrowers.
"We had a horrible defensive inning and it cost us," East coach Natalie Peters said. "This was one of the best games that Alison Mitts has pitched, but we just didn't play any defense behind her. That's the story of our season, giving up a bunch of unearned runs, and it's hard to play when you're in a hole all the time."

One expert on NCAA infractions said the committee should treat Ohio State more favorably because Tressel has departed, but a finding of a lack of institutional control by the athletic department as a whole could still lead to crippling sanctions if, as could be the case, more violations come to light. The Columbus Dispatch reported Monday that Ohio State and the NCAA have launched a separate investigation into quarterback Terrelle Pryor.

“No, I don’t see that,” Cusack says of any possible fallout. “But, you know, I’m sorry, I think democracy requires participation. I mean, I don’t want to proselytize but I do feel some sort of duty to participate in the process in some way other than just blindly getting behind a political party. That just enables them. Both of them, Republicans, Democrats — you get past the right-left paradigm and in the end they’re just two massively funded armies of lobbyists.”
India reached an agreement with Iran in February to pay for almost half of its oil imports from Tehran in Indian rupees because U.S. sanctions made using dollars for transactions nearly impossible.

He was one my favorite teammates that I've ever been around. I've been around a lot of different kind of guys with a lot of different teams. He just commanded respect from Day One as a rookie coming in with a lot of veterans in the locker room. He had a nice presence about himself. He had a more mature presence than a rookie should have. He wasn't the type of guy who would talk a lot or be that 'rah-rah' guy. He was more a guy who led by his actions and his demeanor. A lot of guys respected that, because the way he carried himself.

Chelsea has dominated the FA Cup in recent years, winning it three times in the past five seasons, but its main priority is to win the Champions League — especially after Wednesday's 2-0 home defeat against Newcastle effectively ended its challenge for a top-four place.
The supporting roles are sharp, too: Jack McBrayer (Kenneth on "30 Rock") is hilarious as a newlywed confused and repulsed by sex. And Brand has a way of dryly throwing away his lines that makes his sleazy "other man" character impossible to hate. In fact, at times I found myself rooting for the British hedonist over Peter.

The Republicans argue the law, which also would strip most public workers of nearly all their collective bargaining rights, took effect last weekend because a state office posted it online. Typically, a law takes effect in Wisconsin the day after it's published in the state's official newspaper upon the order of the secretary of state. But Dane County Circuit Judge Maryann Sumi ordered the secretary of state not to have it published until she could hear arguments in one of several lawsuits challenging the law.

The results also don't mean that exercise was responsible. Women who took longer to conceive could also have modified their exercise patterns, researchers noted in the journal Fertility and Sterility, making the relationship the opposite of what it appeared.

Some scientists believe that red wine, in moderate amounts, may improve vascular function and have a less harmful effect on blood pressure than other forms of alcohol -- maybe even a positive effect.

Jerry Lee Lewis was a guy who didn't just embrace the rock 'n' roll lifestyle – he wrote the how-to guide. In his prime, the piano-pounding singer, aka “The Killer,” was the very picture of wild-eyed abandon, a hellion with great hair, a voice to match and two blurs for hands.

As I can attest from personal experience. Fishing from a jetty not many miles from where Eilperin descended in her shark cage, I caught one of those baby great whites. Although it was still in very early infancy — it was no bigger than a large bullfrog — its teeth were its most remarkable feature, needle thin at their points but sharp beyond belief.

Israeli officials watched with deep unease last week as a popular uprising overthrew Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, depriving Israel of its only reliable ally in the Middle East.

Hey, Chris: No doubt your scenario is among the options being considered by the Browns. It's not an easy call.
A. Everyone was so willing to help. The Small Business Administration and Kathy Cook were a huge help. They came in and checked everything out and expedited a loan to me for the work to be done. You would think dealing with government would be a bunch of red tape. But they seemed to cut right through it.
I thought I'd seen it all with displays of disrespect and abject narcissism among politicians, but John Edwards topped it all. For Edwards to allow his daughter to stand by his side day in and day out while the gruesome details of her father's betrayal of her mother are aired in a public courtroom is beyond despicable. Clearly the only person John Edwards is, or ever has been, interested in protecting is himself.
Today, Gencarelli plans to move his cart concept into a brick-and-mortar space -- the former Johnny B's at Southeast Hawthorne Boulevard and 12th Avenue -- adding beer, wine and outdoor seating to his pork-focused sandwich menu.
"It appears we're off to a rocky start," he said.
With Osha Thai's growing success, the sisters split the management of the restaurants - Souksamlane runs the three locations downtown, while Korkhieola looks after the neighborhood outposts in the Tenderloin, Mission, Cow Hollow and Glen Park.

For the first time in his six starts on tour, Reed is in position to make some noise after a 6-under 66 in the first round of the Wells Fargo Championship. That put him ahead of some of Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson.
As a whole, the city's top taxpayers aren't eager to chat about their distinction. Many, Clancy included, did not respond to messages.
I ended up renting a room from a former Sun photographer in Hampden, which the site describes as having a small town atmosphere with “elegant to funky stores, eclectic restaurants and special events like the Hon Fest.” It sounds great and it is.
As in previous years, the survey does not rate smaller local grocers such as Acme, Buehler's, Dave's, Heinen's or Marc's, because they don't show up in enough surveys to be ranked.
Wall Street had expected that Merck would have to pay even more. "He managed the Vioxx litigation extraordinarily well, and there were a lot of doubting Thomases, especially on Wall Street," said Barbara Ryan, an analyst who follows drug companies for Deutsche Bank.

Meteorologists painted a rosy picture for the rest of the holiday weekend. Saturday is expected to be sunny with temperatures around 80 degrees, and winds of up to 20 mph. Sunday and Monday should be just as sunny, but with less wind, said National Weather Service meteorologist Jim Poirier.
While the attempted-murder charge was never directly mentioned at Hunter's sentencing hearing, a number of people referred to McCracken's "legal troubles," and several officers testified that he had not been the same since the injury.
“The public was never in danger from the explosive devices, which were controlled by an undercover FBI employee,” the FBI said in a written statement this morning. “The explosives that the defendants allegedly purchased and attempted to use were inoperable and posed no threat to the public.”
Also order: As green as a springtime meadow, the green tea balls ($2.95/4) are similar to sesame balls in their glutinous texture but with an addictive sweet-and-salty black sesame paste in the middle instead of red bean paste. Thin rice noodles with soy sauce ($4.95) are simple but good with garlic chives and bean sprouts.

Alba said he woke up the morning after the verdict, still thinking about his role in convicting Elwell.
Add a heaping helping of curtido and it's doubtful you'll have room for the canoa, a sort of Latin banana split filled with a fluffy cinnamon leche that has the consistency of marshmallow fluff, or the flan, a rich, eggy rendition with plenty of caramel punch.
I think there are a mix of Tea Party folks out there — some genuine, some scheming and some nuttier than jumbo jar of Jif.
A Bend, Ore., veterinarian has performed life-saving CPR on an injured bald eagle that was under anesthesia during physical therapy.
Dear Anonymous 1: Good visual, thanks to Jennifer Grey, who got the most publicly regretted nose job in history.
Snee fell onto an official that day and told him, "Get me off the field." Two weeks ago, umpire Undrey Walsh saw Ware fall over as he tried getting up and then lean to the left while walking.

The group's ascent onto the international stage is part of the everlasting appeal of Irish music, Crosby notes.
Meanwhile, roughly 20 minutes before its daily noon newscast, state broadcaster China Central Television broke in with a special report on Mr. Kim's death. It was a three-minute bare-bones account that echoed the facts from North Korea's official media, plus a chronology of the major events of his life, intercut with stock footage. Several minutes later, it aired the program again.
“The times were very similar,” Oregon Project coach Alberto Salazar said.
One word of caution: Even at these prices, you aren't guaranteed an escape from the occasional rude comments and rude behavior by some fans. Twice when my son and I got up for relief and refreshments, we returned to find our seats occupied by others. That upset my son, but at least the interlopers were willing to move after being asked just once.
The case centers around a new flight management system (FMS) the airline installed in some of its fleet. The technology allows the planes to fly more efficiently while maintaining safety standards required by the government.
McDonald, 48, is the wolf program's biggest booster. He says he has been an alcoholic since he was 18. He spent 10 years in the Navy and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. "I wasn't a mean or angry drunk," he said. "I would just take everything we had to buy alcohol."
Kaine Horman and Desiree Young invited a group of Portland news organizations to Brooks Hill Historic Church across from Skyline School. The family spoke to the crowd of more than a dozen journalists from behind a table with two teddy bears and three stuffed frogs.
Still, there was plenty of money thrown around Washington last year as battles emerged on other issues.
Just because it looks like a walnut-burl table, a marble column or a panoramic view of the Golden Gate Bridge doesn't mean it is - especially if you spy one of San Francisco's most sought-after decorative painters nearby, rifling through his or her toolbox.
Stephen Tisch, 27, of the Waretown section of Ocean Township, Ocean County has been suspended from his job at Walnut Street Elementary School. He is being held on $75,000 bail with no 10 percent option.

The new iPad starts at $499, the same as the previous model, the iPad 2, when it debuted a year ago. Apple sold 15.4 million tablets between October and December of last year alone - when the tablet was just six months old. But people in line who only owned the iPad2 for a short time weren't angry. Instead they bragged about being able to sell their so-called "old" model for 80 percent of what they paid.
With Aldi stores on the Paseo, Independence Avenue and at the intersection of Troost and Meyer, the site makes strategic sense for the chain. Also, because the discount chain's stores are smaller than the typical supermarket, Aldi is a better fit for the smaller lots that dot the urban landscape.

Over the course of the night, meetings are held and decisions are made. It helps that the bigger bosses don't know a lot about the nuts and bolts of the business, so they need explanation. ("Speak as you might to a young child. Or a golden retriever," Tuld tells the brilliant Sullivan, a bona fide rocket scientist from MIT who joined Wall Street for the big bucks.)
Other witnesses told police they saw the helicopter making one circle over the area and that it suddenly came straight down as it headed toward the back of the school.
"We do not regulate for that," said spokeswoman LeAnn McCarthy.
Mounds of coal still thrust toward the steely sky along Ashtabula Harbor and a freighter or two still inch toward Lake Erie, but there is little else to cheer for in this town about an hour east of Cleveland. Meyer is the area's most famous son -- OSU offensive coordinator Jim Bollman also hails from Ashtabula -- and everyone is rooting for him.
Women also tend to be "new shooters," so they don't arrive with bad habits that Houser has to help them unlearn. And they don't argue or obsess over tactics. "You pick the gun up, you do exactly what I ask you to do," he said.
"I'm not done yet," she said. "I hope I'm not going to be done for quite some time."
It seems like a contradiction to go to a live event and put on headphones, but the experience neither makes nor breaks the evening. There are moments when the wall of sound effects makes for a dazzling head trip, others when it disconnects you from the actors on stage. But why not experiment with a classic that thumbed its nose at the rules?
Although Dae Jin behaves like a typical, chauvinist Korean husband, says Kwon, deep down he adores his wife and relies on her strength. "Korean men," she says, holding her arms open wide, "they love their wives like this, but they can only express like this," bringing her hands close together.
Representatives of Key and Fifth Third said Tuesday they don't talk about merger-and-acquisition issues.
Shultz, 55, did not expound during the meeting on her reason for leaving, but said later that it was an "accumulation of ordinary personal things" that would keep her from devoting the hours needed to the volunteer position. Shultz is a single mother with a daughter in high school.
By staying small, Sill aims for what he calls the sweet spot: the earliest-stage companies. If you invest early, when a company's valuation is lower, you can sometimes own a larger portion of the company for less money. And if it does well, you enjoy a higher investment return. ``You only need one or two winners to have a phenomenal return,'' he says.

In light of the tragic incident in Farmington Hills, the Department of Corrections wants to review all parolees, probationers and the agents supervising them. I hope they do an honest review and admit that the workload per agent is very high. Also, the governor and Legislature have closed at least two prisons in the last three years and will be closing at least one more next year.
The adapter's low profile, impact-resistant faceplate design eliminates catch points to reduce potential damage due to incidental contact – a common concern in modular furniture connectivity solutions.

United announced earlier this week that it would reduce the number of seats available on its U.S. routes by as much as 2.5 percent this year and also trim international expansion plans, topping growth at 3.5 percent at most, compared with an earlier projection of up to 5.5 percent.
He wants a lot. He'll get it because a recovered Manning is one of the best in the game, and a team won't have to give up draft choices or veteran players to sign the free agent. The teams he will narrow the choice to are the Dolphins (no dome, but warm weather), Arizona (dome), Houston (dome), Washington (no dome, but the franchise wants him bad, and Shanahan did get to the Super Bowl with two other quarterbacks -- Elway and Steve Young), the New York Jets (Condon, I believe, represents Ryan) and the 49ers.
FRANKFURT—BMW AG on Wednesday reported a sharp jump in third-quarter net profit and lifted its profit-margin target for its auto segment amid booming demand for its large vehicles, particularly in China.
Block says other reasons may be driving increased fraud, which he prefers to call résumé padding. "We don't have a human-resources attitude in this country, and some job seekers are fighting to survive," says Block. When job seekers are desperate for their résumés and qualifications to stand out, they may resort to padding their experience or education. Technology also may contribute to the reason job seekers must fight so hard to stand out. Many workers come home and look for work through their computers, plus geography is less of an issue in job searches. "As a result, you've got more and more strangers looking at strangers' biographies," says Block.
Smith, a sophomore, scattered seven hits in 3 2/3 innings. She got help from a big 4-6-3 double play in the fourth before Woolridge, a freshman, came on to end the inning with a strikeout. Woolridge was perfect in 3 1/3 innings.

Saints running back Reggie Bush tweeted the other day that he's going to make good use of the time off due to the lockout, vacationing and relaxing. No beef here. But I like what Vick is doing with his time off far better. Also, like what Steelers defensive back Troy Polamalu did in going back to USC to finish his degree.
Boemer also was named to the all-Missouri Valley Conference first team, his third straight year as part of the all-league team. Boemer posted a 93 percent blocking percentage and did not allow a sack for a Salukis team that finished 4-7 overall and 2-6 in the MVC.

A couple of Dutch entrepreneurs, (deserving of sainthood) perfected a method to "burn" the wine, heating it to distill out the alcohol and collect the concentrated liquid for travel. The burnt-wine product, "brandwijn" in Dutch, became known in English as brandy.
In March, the Lions hosted O.J. Atogwe on a free-agent visit and re-signed Erik Coleman to back up Louis Delmas and Amari Spievey. Atogwe still hasn't signed with a team.
Here is Beck’s take on the same subject, direct from the office of redundancy.
The search to replace him comes at a time of great turnover in Maryland's education leadership. Nearly half of the superintendencies in the state have recently turned over or will soon. Searches are being conducted for school superintendents for the state and for Howard County.
Legally speaking, prosecuting cyber rape can be quite difficult. As Chicago attorney Corri D. Fetman says, "Targeting these websites can be very problematic. Site owners are often difficult to track down, especially if operating on an illegal foreign site. Additionally, the site may also invoke protection from the Communications Decency Act (which protects the website from liability for content that users post)."
However, what we'll never know, Frank Kelley says, is what was lost because of the takeover attempt by Goldsmith and the chilling effect it may have had on many others.
Hurwitz and Schlossberg inevitably revive memorable moments from the first movie, including Kumar's bedroom fantasy with a giant bag of pot and another road trip with former "Doogie Howser, M.D." star Neil Patrick Harris, who returns as an endlessly randy, doped-up version of himself. (Stick around through the end-credits for a quick Doogie bonus.)
It's disturbing to turn on Nightline and see the anchor whose face is normally associated with Times Square standing on a local street. Or to pour the a.m. coffee as a Good Morning America host queries a frightened mother about her missing baby with Kansas City police crime scene footage rolling.
Mac An Iomaire acknowledges his pitch was calculated, in part, to appeal to Ireland's hurt pride as a nation. He included the Gaelic hurling stick because it's an obvious symbol of nationalism for any Irishman; he personally hasn't played hurling since he was around 12.
At the former Arco Arena, plans are being made to begin selling season tickets for next season in a big campaign that would kick off next month. Corporate sponsors are already being approached.

Under Dawson's proposal, Baltimore Racing Development would partner with his company, Wilkes Lane Capital and Dillon Racing, a firm that offered to run operations on race day.
"Before we started launching people into space as private citizens, people thought that was a pie-in-the-sky idea," Anderson said. "We're in this for decades. But it's not a charity. And we'll make money from the beginning."
In addition, the vandals spray-painted a storage trailer behind the bleachers, and spray painted and threw a wooden bleacher off the top of the announcer's box.
The recently formed Jefferson County Council passed a resolution last week requiring that all county-owned vehicles be parked in the county seat of Hillsboro when not in official use, to save money on gas. Boyer refuses to follow the "politically motivated" move and doesn't believe the council has the authority to dictate his policy.
The Pirates rewarded star center fielder Andrew McCutchen with a six-year deal for $51.5 million. They signed a quality defensive shortstop, Clint Barmes. They're finally spending some money.

There's something a little bit different about Chagrin Falls' Mark Iammarino, Aurora's Bob Mihalik and Kirtland's Tiger LaVerde. It begins with their somewhat unusual day jobs -- for football coaches. Iammarino is a guidance counselor, Mihalik a ninth-grade English teacher and LaVerde teaches advance-placement calculus and advanced-placement statistics. All three schools are rated among the state's best academically.
In the first of two studies released Wednesday by the journal Science, a team led by MIT geophysicist Maria Zuber scanned the surface of Mercury's northern hemisphere and found the planet's surface to be unusually flat when compared with the terrain of the moon or Mars.
But Frima and Chaim never returned. And Poyla died later that day.
Convicted Washington sniper Lee Boyd Malvo this year attempted to change his name while in prison, saying he wanted to protect himself from harm by other prisoners. A judge turned him down, saying he hadn't been assaulted yet and that other prisoners would know his background anyway.

"It's kind of rare," Peppers said of being on such a star-studded yet selfless defense. "Most of the time you have guys playing for contracts. It's part of the game. That's what some guys do.

Romney stuck to his theme that he is the only businessman in the Republican presidential race and the only one who can undo the economic damage he believes President Obama has inflicted. “I have the experience of leading and guiding enterprises,” said Romney, who made millions of dollars as the head of a private equity firm.
The struggling operator of Albertsons, Jewel-Osco and other grocery chains says it lost $424 million, or $2 per share, in for the three months ended Feb. 25. That's compared with a profit of $95 million, or 44 cents per share, in the year-ago period.

Cutting half-a-million dollars from spending would reduce the proposed increase in the tax rate by about a penny, to 2 cents per $100 in assessed property value instead of 3 cents, raising the average tax bill by about $32 instead of $49, officials said. Among the cuts the council proposed Monday was one to eliminate a custodial position, which would save $55,000 a year.
"She taught me and my brothers and sisters to be grateful for anything we got," Nagbe said. "She made us understand that whatever we got or whatever we had, it could be taken away from us."
Even while Jobs was alive, Cook handled appearances in front of Wall Street analysts. He spoke precisely and calmly, and his language wasn't very quotable. At a Goldman Sachs investors meeting in February, for instance, he said "our high order bit is we want to please customers." A "high order bit" is a computer science term for the most important piece of data in a set.
West Virginia’s air has generally improved compared to last year’s State of the Air report, and in fact was at its cleanest since the first annual report 12 years ago. However, West Virginia also claimed seven of the 27 metro areas listed as the most polluted cities for year-round particle pollution in the country.
An evidence hearing was set for June 15.
The obsession with candidates' gender is absolutely a media-driven phenomenon. The main group of voters as concerned about gender as the mainstream media might be right-wing men who become very anxious at the idea of female authority, even if it's far away in Washington and only felt through the faceless economy and the mechanisms of the state. After them are feminists, who put a lot of money and effort toward getting more women in power, but only pro-choice, liberal women. So already, Palin has fallen off the map for them.
"It has been so scary with the earthquake and everything," said 22-year-old Miaki Tomiyama. "The team has given us happiness."
On the House side, Speaker Frank McNulty has been inscrutable. I like a good smart-aleck retort as much as anyone, but his regular quips from the podium directed at the Senate are beneath the dignity of his office. Worse, they aren't funny.

There will be entertainment, costumed characters, Summit Soundz DJ and other surprises in store for the youngsters.
When you returned home and re-entered your family system, you threw it off balance. People are acting out and blaming you because it's easiest. And your own expectations of how wonderful things would be might be disproportional.
Dogging it? Surely, these critics jest. They want us to believe LBJ suddenly decided in Game 5 of a tied series to lose interest...on his home floor, no less? And we have proof of this where, again?
"Everything I worked so hard for is gone," said Glover, a clerk at a medical billing company, who lives with her two daughters, both students at Passaic Community College.
The hot sound in the U.K. right now (and one that should come to these shores in a big way in 2012) is dubstep, an aggressive, bass-heavy variant of electronic dance music. Most pop singers who have tried to harness the force of dubstep have instead been flattened by the synthesizer wobble. Katy B is the great exception. She doesn't have Skinner's command of detail or eye for irony, but she's a remarkably frank and forceful narrator, and tough enough to go toe-to-toe with anybody's beat. "On a Mission" spun off seven state-of-the-art hit singles in Britain, including "Witches' Brew," the young singer's declaration of purpose.
Now 18, Maurice speaks confidently and quotably as he explains how Vaughn's presence helped him navigate through college applications, kept him on track when he struggled with fatherlessness and taught him to value academics over athletics.

An All-SEC cornerback, Jenkins has been praised for his man-coverage skills and is likely the second best at his position in the draft behind LSU's Morris Claiborne. But character concerns with his past drug use, four children by three different mothers and switching agents after the combine might have dropped him out of the first round.
Statehouse staff carried out desks and chairs for senators, and the hearing -- complete with testimony and parliamentary procedure -- was held in front of hundreds of demonstrators.
Trans fats, known as hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils, are called the deadly fats. By far the greatest proportion of trans fats we eat are in products made by the processed-foods industry, using partially hydrogenated unsaturated fats. Trans fats are nonessential fats, and they have no nutritional value.
In defense of their decision to OK money for the new jail, supervisors pointed to the impact of realignment, the poor condition of the Women's Jail and the need to have better facilities to ease prisoners back into the community.

Sporting Kansas City secured the best start in club history Sunday with a 1-0 win against Chivas USA at the Home Depot Center in Carson, Calif.
Born and reared in San Francisco, the avid outdoorsman has taught photography to high school students and worked for other, more traditional tour outfits – the kind that herd large groups on and off buses to snap quick photos of Muir Woods or a winery and then hustle them to the next destination.

It was great fun to play with the children and hear them laugh. But watching them eat a nutritious, good hot dinner, be serious about their schoolwork and learn how to exist in an increasingly difficult world moved me beyond words.
Guanajuato also may be the narrow-street capital of America. The town was originally built in a canyon of the Guanajuato River. As it expanded, twisting paths up the canyon's sides became cobblestone streets or callejones -- alleyways -- lined with multiple-story buildings.

Julie & Julia & Ruth & Marc ...
Registering for something like a fundraising ride, a race or a fitness competition can be a powerful tool for motivating a person to get off the couch and push his or her fitness to a higher level. Just consider the loafer who signs up to run a marathon six months from now. In those few minutes it took to register, she made a powerful statement about what she intends to do over the next half year.
Both officials are sincere -- but I still prefer the fun mirrors for laughs.
Land-use experts, environmentalists, elected officials and others will take part in a forum on the rehabilitation of "brownfield" sites and other vacant lots throughout Sacramento from 12:30 to 4 p.m. Wednesday at the Sacramento Food Bank & Community Services, 3333 Third Ave. The event is sponsored by Ubuntu Green and the Coalition on Regional Equity/Sacramento Housing Alliance.
“We wanted them to play baseball, but a little bit better level then the recreation leagues,” Chatham said. “It was a lot of fun. The kids got a kick out of the opening ceremony.
“His home runs are going to come, there is no question about that,” said Orioles starter Jake Arrieta who is scheduled to face Pujols for the first time Saturday. “But if we can limit him to the singles and doubles and not really allow him to drive in two, three, four runs a game, chances are we are going to have some success.
