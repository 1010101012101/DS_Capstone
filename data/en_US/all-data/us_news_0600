The performance went over so well that Romney aimed to replicate it Friday evening while rallying at Cleveland State University. He charmed the crowd of about 350 with a story about how he met his wife, Ann, in elementary school -- when he was in fourth grade, she in second. He joked that he wasn't interested in a younger woman until he was a senior, she a sophomore. And he talked about persuading Ann's date to a high school party to let him drive her home.

"Where's Number 4?''
The film is directed by Chris Weitz, who once did the very fine “About a Boy” (and whose grandmother was the silent-era Mexican star, Lupita Tovar). He clearly has a feel for this sort of family material, and a connection to this culture.
It's deja vu all over again in The Hangover Part II, only dirtier and more dangerous, if you can imagine that. If director Todd Phillips used the first movie to see how far he could push the envelope, this one licks and seals it.
"I feel that strength is more important, even in the 15, for me," she said. "I need to work on my finishing speed, but I feel I can run a good race just off strength."
"She's a real pit bull when it comes to things she deeply believes in," said Finkbeiner, the former Toledo mayor.
Peter Hammer, director of the Damon J. Keith Center for Civil Rights at Wayne State University in Detroit, said he considered Obama's statement "a clear example of the president taking a leadership position and standing for justice."
There was steady elegance in the circling, interweaving lines played by violinists Nadya Tichman and Melissa Kleinbart in the opening Allegro. And one sensed that the whole group was enjoying its chance to play this perfect music. But out in the ninth row, the harpsichord -- pointing in a different direction than during "Water Music -- was inaudible, and the low strings sounded thin. Was it Zellerbach's dicey acoustics? Hard to say, but the final movement's non-stop motion was muddy.
Some even showed up at her Florissant home on the weekends. She got to the point where she didn't open her door.

"It's a wonderful idea, and the idea behind it is absolutely splendiferous," says the venerable Val Camilletti, owner and operator of Val's Halla Records, which this year is celebrating 40 years in Oak Park. "The idea is to pay homage to your local record store, say hello, have some coffee and doughnuts, hear some live music, enjoy some sales and all that good stuff - to stop in and say, ‘Hey, I'm glad you're still alive.'
“I remember a conversation I had when I was 14 with the track coach at Plainfield High,” Campbell says, referring to the great Harold Bruguiere. “And he asked me what I wanted to be. I told him, ‘The best athlete in Plainfield.’ Then it became ‘The best in New Jersey,’ and ‘The best in America’ and ‘The best in the world.’
But Bennett said he probably wouldn't make a report just because, for example, a litigant compared judges to Nazis.
The family's case also was stronger because Hill was a longtime user of chewing tobacco who did not drink or smoke cigarettes, factors tobacco companies point to as causing the cancer, Ponvert said.
The French newspaper Le Monde reported that Merah was arrested in southern Afghanistan in November 2010 and quoted an unnamed high-ranking U.S. official there as saying that the young man's passport showed he had traveled to Israel, Iraq and Jordan.
Something will be worth celebrating. It's just a matter of when, as the 6-foot-2, 213-pounder toes the most comfortable borderline possible: He could hear his name in the first round Thursday, or it's just a short wait to a no-worse-than second-round selection.
Imagine how Pat Day, Mike Smith and Jerry Bailey felt when Thunder Gulch won the 1995 Derby with Gary Stevens aboard for the first time. Day and Smith both rode Thunder Gulch in prep races, but opted for Timber Country (third) and Talkin Man (12th) in the Derby. Bailey was offered the mount, but turned it down to ride Tejano Run (second).
2009 Bergstrom Cumberland Reserve Willamette Valley Pinot Noir ($38, 14.1%): If some of Josh Bergstrom's 2009 single-vineyard efforts were tough to parse, this perennially deft blend shows off a racy, foresty side: dried roses and cranberry, with sandalwood and bramble fruit. A delicious high-wire act.
He began practicing with a few friends. In 1998 things turned serious. Two firefighters died within weeks apart and Stone played their funerals, his first public performances.
The friend introduced the girl to Cantry and an adult woman, Holmes said.

Split firebricks worked better. They are the same length and height, but thinner and half the weight. But the sides were precariously balanced, and I was afraid the thinner bricks might slip through the oven rack.
Jackson is Elizabeth's 10th homicide victim of 2011. The city has seen a spike in homicides this year and appears to be on track to exceed the 14 that occurred there in 2010.
And when bartenders aren't positive, but only suspect, a patron is drunk, the instructions from the OLCC are clear, too. "If you're not sure," the OLCC training materials say, "don't serve."
That's Oregon all over. The federal government says nearly 1.3 million Oregonians -- 34 percent of the state's population -- lived in high unemployment counties last year. Things haven't improved much this year. Oregon's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for February was 10.5 percent statewide, and seven counties still had unemployment rates exceeding 12 percent.
I refuse to refer to this trip as a vacation - six countries in 15 days is an adventure.

Q Isn't $12.50 a tad steep for a sharpened pencil?
9. The Twins entered this year with six AL Central titles in the last nine years, but you have to wonder how they'll rebound from this injury-filled year. Justin Morneau continues to have concussion problems. Joe Mauer's future as an everyday catcher is questionable. Michael Cuddyer and Jason Kubel are free agents and injuries have decimated the pitching staff.
"It feels great that Florida State and Miami are both relevant in the ACC," Florida State guard Luke Loucks said. "This league isn't just about Duke and North Carolina anymore."
The computer theft charge, a second-degree crime, carries a minimum sentence of five years in prison with a one-year, eight-month period of parole ineligibility. But Hreha's lawyer Kevin Main, citing Hreha's clean criminal record, asked Billmeier to sentence Hreha to a lesser third-degree crime, which carries a minimum sentence of three years in prison with a one-year period of parole ineligibility.

The Bay Area is blessed with stellar "first couples" of old-time, bluegrass, country and jazz music, including Jody Stecher and Kate Brislin, Laurie Lewis and Tom Rozum and Wesla Whitfield and Mike Greensill. Berkeley's Eric and Suzy Thompson edge the others as MVPs this year on the basis of "Dream Shadows"(www.ericandsuzy.com), their latest love letter to Southern music — black, white, rural, urban, string band, ragtime, folk ballads, bluegrass, Cajun, blues — of the1920s, '30s and '40s. With just a few assists from friends, these guardians of authenticity entwine guitar, mandolin, banjo, cuatro, fiddle, Cajun accordion, triangle and sincere and soulful vocals in an eclectic but harmonious manifestation of deep roots that bind us all.
My stubbornness gradually dissolved into loneliness, and eventually the loss of spiritual camaraderie picked at my well-being, making me feel exposed and vulnerable. I searched for an oasis but saw only sand.

"As a coach, you want to be involved at the highest level. In this country, that is MLS," Hamlett said. "That's something I wanted to get back into. But I wanted to make sure I wasn't getting back into it just to get back. I wanted to get into a good situation and I felt like this was the right opportunity."

øThird-seeded Marin Cilic cruised past Matthias Bachinger 6-3, 6-2 to reach the last eight.
Hey, Kenn: I still believe Colt McCoy can be a winning quarterback in this league with a good supporting cast. But if the Browns draft RG3, he'll be their starting quarterback from day one.
Page 193: He describes the "continuum of force" concept. "Knowing somebody has an edged weapon we have the right to pull our gun and point it at them because we're behind, because of action-reaction we already talked about."
The Enders, meanwhile, treat their rented teen bodies as if they were Hertz loaners. Prime Destinations strictly forbids car racing, sky diving or sex in rented bodies, but that doesn't prevent many Ender renters from behaving recklessly. The rentals have no idea what's happening to their bodies, which are being controlled via neurochip by the Enders, whose bodies are on life support at Prime Destinations and whose brains control the action.
It also helps that Masala Bhangra is relatively stiff. At no point are you asked to wiggle your hips, as in Zumba. Even the arm motions are fairly rigid. Also it's highly repetitive and strongly rhythmic, meaning you have several chances to get it right, and losing your place is tough.
Consequently, payroll taxes apply to only about 84 percent of earned income. Change the cap on the payroll tax so it covers 90 percent of income again and you will have solved most of the "threat" to the Social Security system. Incidentally, responsible Congressional leaders, including Maryland's own Elijah Cummings and Donna Edwards, proposed that last April, but they have been almost ignored by the mass media and buried by the lobbyists protecting the interests of those who have gained the most from our economic system but don't want to contribute commensurate amounts to maintain it.
How much does the HPV vaccine cost?
When I turned 40, I lost her and grew up. That was 16 years ago. I miss her more each day. And when all is said and done, I am grateful for a woman who loved with great abandon and in so doing passed on the best of what she had to offer through me. I hope with all my heart that she knows how I feel. Happy Mother's Day, Mom.
With armloads of designer duds for pennies-on-the-dollar prices donated by a slew of Best Dressed Hall of Fame types - mint Missoni for $100! Chanel suits! - the Salvation Army "Reflections on Style" Luncheon always is a sellout. Chair Carol Sharpe chose a leopard flair theme for this year's event at River Oaks Country Club, which honored Jeanie Kilroy.
The club rumbles beneath half the hotel rooms, as do the nearby trains throughout the evening. It all makes for a cacophony of sounds -- there is little opportunity to nod off to sleep early -- but peace and quiet are not really what they're selling at the Hotel Congress. (Some quiet rooms are available upon request.) It's more of a complete entertainment -- and even culinary -- experience.
We don't know for sure. In this study we were investigating red meat as it is consumed in the United States, which is mostly lot-fed, grain-fed beef. I'm quite sure we would not have enough people consuming mostly grass-fed beef to be able to look at that on its own.
"That homeowner that couldn’t get one dollar and they’re getting a check for $1,500, they’re not going to tell us we settled too cheap," said Miller, who led the negotiations for the state attorneys general.
Parise joked that he wouldn’t have Kovalchuk to protect him. After Zac Rinaldo slew-footed Parise on Feb. 4, Kovalchuk went after the Flyers’ rookie before Brayden Schenn unwisely stepped in and lost a one-punch fight.

Both Herbalife and Youngevity use multilevel marketing, a business strategy that turns customers into a sales force. The products are sold through a network of distributors, such as moms and chiropractors, who earn additional income by recruiting other distributors. Some liken this system to a pyramid scheme, but it is a $125 billion industry dominated by reputable companies such as Mary Kay, Amway and Avon. (One of the board members of Youngevity is the former chairman of Mary Kay.)

Sarnoff graduated from Minnesota's Moorhead State University (now Minnesota State) in 1970, then moved to Portland to study theater at the University of Portland. He earned a master's degree in 1974 but couldn't make a living on the stage, so when he heard about a new radio station that was looking for disc jockeys he applied. Experience was not necessary.
On my regular Friday morning chat on Oregon Public Broadcasting with political scientist Bill Lunch and OPB host Geoff Norcross, we talked about the upcoming Oregon legislative session as well as Washington Sen.

And the two charged through the mob, like two Little Leaguers rushing for the bubble gum box. They let you take the ride with them. A ride that the Bay Area won't ever forget.
The research analyzed 43 studies involving 28,004 fathers observed during the period between the first trimester of pregnancy until one year after the birth. Researchers concluded that the overall estimate of paternal depression was 10.4 percent, more than double the 4.8 percent prevalence among men in the general population. About a quarter of women experience depression during pregnancy and about one-tenth have postpartum depression.
"Teachers had been working harder, not smarter," Shackelford said. "We talked about working smarter, not harder."
I admit I am susceptible to the euphoric effects of a heated steering wheel, and I don't even live in the Snow Belt. I further concede that all this low-cost, high-tech gear has the power to redeem a harvest-gold 1972 Mercury Montego (pause for wistful nostalgia here). My point is, if you're ponying up for a new car of this size/performance/price, the full-kit Optima is dispositive. It will make you happy. It will make you comfortable. Your butt will thank you.
Next comes the body hacked into big pieces and pan-fried in butter with scallions. Can there be anything more decadent? The meat, which comes out of the shell easily, is rich and messy and tastes of pure sweet crab. Washed down with a dry Austrian Riesling from F.X. Pichler (we brought it with us) that cuts through the butter like a knife, it is one of the best food-and-wine combinations I've had in my life.

When my brother died in Vietnam in 1967, my father reached out to Joe Paterno in his grief. He wrote to Joe and asked what Joe would do if he lost a player from injury. Mr. Paterno wrote back and expressed his sympathy and how he would handle the situation. That letter from Joe meant the world to my father. I was a freshman at Penn State at the time and was both touched and surprised that a coach so busy would answer my father. The letter was framed and put on the wall next to the flag from my brother’s funeral.

The Constitution makes no mention of states having a "sovereign immunity" if they violate federal laws, but the Rehnquist court said it was an implicit principle dating to the 18th century.

* Peggy is working late at the office (having very effectively shaken Roger down for some cash to do the last-minute work on the Mohawk Airlines campaign) and hears a sound. She's nervous, because she thinks she's alone. Looking around, she finds Dawn, the African American secretary, sleeping in an office. They both scream in surprise. Peggy offers to let Dawn come back to her place where their moment of sisterly bonding is broken as Peggy hesitates a fateful moment too long before leaving Dawn in proximity of Peggy's purse, loaded with Roger's money. Dawn sees the hesitation, and knows exactly what it's about -- the supposedly progressive Peggy can't suppress her instinct to be suspicious about leaving her money with an African American woman. Also lingering in the atmosphere are the race riots that occurred in the summer of 1966 in Chicago and other cities.

"Since the court's ruling prior to the grand jury's indictment was not appealable by the state, we feel it is necessary to file this charge in order to preserve the state's ability to have a full hearing with the right to appeal, if necessary,'' the district attorney's office wrote in a statement released tonight.

The resolution required 50 votes to pass in the 99-seat House, a Batchelder spokesman said. That means a 52-42 roll-call tally was razor thin. In fact, it passed only with the help of 10 House Democrats, including Minority Leader Armond Budish of Beachwood. (Among the other nine Democrats voting "yes" were Reps. John Barnes and Mike Foley, both of Cleveland, and Zack Milkovich of Akron.)

Recreational crabbers are limited to using five traps, which must be marked with a buoy with the letter "R" painted on them. Commercial crabbers must mark their traps with the letter "V" for blue crabs and the letter "X" for stone crabs. Also, the name and address of the crabber must be permanently attached to the trap. And, each trap must have three escape rings so smaller crabs can escape, as well as a biodegradable panel or device that will deteriorate so crabs will not be forever trapped if the trap line is cut or the trap is abandoned.
"When Maya first came home with information about ballroom dancing, she wasn't happy and I thought it was a horrible idea," Alison Seitz said. "But the recital was great and the kids all liked it more and more as the week went on. My favorite part was the end when kids danced with their parents."
These plants do best with little to no pruning. If you must prune, try to do so in a way that will retain their natural shape, rather than trimming them into a lollipop shape. Any pruning should be done in the spring before the summer's heat brings on new growth.

Cohl’s in the editing room now, and the movie is “starting to take serious shape,” a source says. And I’m told he isn’t pulling any punches.

You cannot get lost on Gozo.

Before you hire the company, consider the price they’re offering for the job. Sure, we all want to pay the lowest price possible, but if someone is offering to the job for substantially less than the competition, ask yourself why. It’s possible they’re using cheaper, sub-standard materials or they plan to cut corners. In the long-term, this kind of shoddy work will cost you more in re-dos.

One of the main reasons for the growing number of preterm births is a high number of births of twins and "higher-order multiples," all of which are more likely to come into the world too soon.

Those who are used to drinks that cost $12 or more at trendier spots will welcome the savings if they stick to the low end of the drinks list here.

Sometimes stereotypes ring true -- such as in Chicago, summer of 1919, when for a dozen violent and confusing days it indeed resembled the raw-knuckled, back-room-dealing, racially polarized humidor of a city we know today. Over 12 fateful days, Chicago witnessed the first major aviation disaster in the nation (a blimp!), the kidnapping and murder of a 6-year-old girl, a transit strike and a vicious race riot in which dozens of victims were brutally murdered and hundreds more injured. The weather? Scorching, muggy and miserable, of course.

He was going to shoot her again. She was able to shoot him first. Thank God, she lived. Those are the stories that no one reads about. God bless the St. Louis police.

The Jayhawks are dominant. They have two of the best players in the country in Sherron Collins and Cole Aldrich and a championship coach in Bill Self. What they don't have is the rotation that the Panthers have. UNI brings in subs like they're hockey line changes, three and four guys at a time. It keeps coach Ben Jacobson's squad fresh and can be a mental back-breaker to a tired team. As a result, we have our first huge upset. Northern Iowa 80-76.
"We want the link between heartburn and cancer to become as well-known and understood as the need to wear sunscreen when outdoors," says Mordechai, who lost her husband, Monte, to esophageal cancer in 2008.

Some of that excitement translates to the menu at Lua, which boasts some creative interpretations as well as familiar favorites. The food here is not as dazzling and/or authentic as the food made by either Presilla or Garces, but then again, it’s not meant to be.

In 2008, at the urging of Schlau, Larry Trent, then-director of the Illinois State Police, made dramatic policy changes in his department.

Make the dressing: Whisk together the lemon juice, zest, egg yolk, mustard, and salt and pepper. Slowly whisk in the neutral oil to emulsify, then slowly whisk in the extra-virgin olive oil. Fold in the Parmesan. If the dressing is too thick (it should be the consistency of heavy cream) whisk in a little cold water. Refrigerate covered until ready to use.
Vail called in Ute Indians for a snow dance. In Steamboat, 425 residents — most of them jobless — spent the week before Christmas shoveling snow from the trees onto slopes.

Back in August, I authored an essay for these pages asking why Jerry Brown seemed a less vivid, less ambitious version of his colorful past. "Vanilla" was the word I chose  a gubernatorial style too bland even for ulcer-ridden California's tastes.
Investors are still cautious about the economy, especially as the government winds down some of the programs it implemented in 2008 and 2009 to help the economy.

I fought the urge to join facebook for the longest time. I eventually caved. The fun part has been getting back in touch with people I haven't seen or heard from in nearly twenty years. It almost feels like a reunion. Facebook has also shown me why I didn't stay in touch with some of these people in the first place but that's for another time. Facebook has put us in touch with our viewers in ways like never before. People are comfortable on facebook. They are more inclined to send you a message on facebook about a possible story than to actually e-mail you. Dear I say, e-mail is becoming blase? People also seem to be enthralled with every little detail about our personal life. If you can't tell, I live a pretty boring life. That is just me.
Also cool: playing, "Which pool is the best?" We bounced around from the warmest middle pool, up to the top pool beside a gurgling brook, down to the largest pool, with a 3-foot waterfall. My crew took over part of the big pool by playing catch with a foam mini-football we brought and messing around on a couple of innertubes we found there — channeling that "swimming pool" experience that my kids know and love.

Beverly K. Goulet, AMR's chief restructuring officer, said Friday's agreement to work with the bankruptcy creditors committee on potential merger scenarios represented no change in AMR's belief that its fate will be decided by company management, directors and creditors.

“Jack was a big part of this program and a big personality,” Bates said. “He had that decision to make, and we respected it. It was unique. He couldn’t graduate and come back to Princeton. In terms of how we deal with it, it’s a little bit of a subplot because it should be. He was somebody who was an important part of this program, but at the end of the day, it’s Princeton vs. North Carolina and both teams are looking for a win. So that will take a backseat to what goes on ultimately at 11 a.m. on Saturday.”
Smith has stopped 154 of 164 shots (.939 save percentage) in the series. And as good as that is, it should be a major concern for the Hawks that he has yet to steal a game for the Coyotes.

NFM does not handle the disbursement, but the company does provide a monthly service, creating an automatic debit for the monthly payment that then goes directly into the lender's bank account. The cost is $15 per month, and includes a year-end 1099 interest report for the lender, and a 1098 form for the borrower, documenting interest paid on the mortgage loan. Or the parties can agree to pay each other directly, using the loan amortization schedule that is part of the package to determine at year-end how much interest was paid or received.
It used to be comic-book publishers would hand out reprinted issues for Free Comic Book Day.
That change in offensive philosophy has led to more opportunities for wide receivers to get on the field. More receivers on the field, as opposed to one or two running backs, means more chances for more players to make plays in space, including with bubble screens and reverses.
But how about the fine actresses who probably won’t hear their names called on Tuesday? Like Thandie Newton, Phylicia Rashad and Kimberly Elise, all amazing in the otherwise underwhelming “For Colored Girls”? (Not only are they unlikely to be called, but this year’s nominations are likely to be the least diverse in a long time.)

The Jesuits (Society of Jesus) have a name for it — discernment. Discernment is basically a process of individual decision-making that attempts to get a glimpse of God's will apart from one's own ego. The raging debate on same-sex marriage brings this to mind ("A vote of conscience," Jan. 31).

Cons: Jamie wouldn't know this, but the show has been downsized quite a bit since its 2009 opening, with the live band replaced with recorded tracks and the promise of two "name" stars reduced to just Madison who, while delightful, is not a Broadway-caliber actor and admittedly can't sing. Also, as Jamie noted, the comedic parts of the show turn out to be derived from audience plants.
We actually have my family's original manger set. We had to replace the figures that got lost and broken over the years. When I was little, my sister Fran and I would play with the figures like it was a doll house. A doll house with sheep and cows. And Wise Men. A pretty weird doll house when you think of it.

The multiple-head growth is likely due to some form of damage to the meristem -- externally or internally. This may be due to damage or just a strange form to produce more flowers.

Before allowing Dimora to use a taxpayer-funded lawyer, U.S. District Judge Kate O'Malley will almost surely make a close examination of Dimora's finances, Katz said. That doesn't mean he'll have to turn his pockets inside out to demonstrate that he's penniless.
Lenhart missed most of last season on an extended leave following the death of his father. His return and the addition of the other players aren't the only reasons for the team's remarkable turnaround, the players say.
Both moves are part of an initiative to further reduce reliance on the Metropolitan Water District of Los Angeles, which once delivered nearly all of the county's water but today provides less than half.

Amazon had been offering top-selling e-books for $9.99, a cost publishers, agents and writers believed was so low it could drive competitors out of business.

The growth of the Bamboozle is a further example of a trend reshaping concert schedules across America. Big destination festivals like Coachella, Bonnaroo in rural Tennessee and Sasquatch in central Washington are increasingly taking the place of high-profile tours. (Consider: Dave Matthews, who is legendary for his touring stamina, isn’t taking the show on the road this summer; rather, he’s inviting his audience to catch him in performance at a destination festival of his own in Atlantic City.) According to Pollstar, revenue from mainstream touring acts fell 13 percent between 2009 and 2010. Festivals nationwide are selling out.
