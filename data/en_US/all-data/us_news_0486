Perhaps some of these readers have had some kind of experience of God, but it was not strong enough for them to call themselves believers. If you fit in this category, you might want to vote this week for Option 3: “I am inclined to believe in God, but I have too many doubts.” Don’t be embarrassed if you do. Some surveys find that many church members put themselves in this category.

After World War II, educational access was broadened dramatically through a generous GI Bill for returning veterans. The payoff from that program is well documented. The Basic Educational Opportunity Grant (now called the Pell Grant) was initiated in the early 1970s with a goal of making college attainable for many students like me, who could not have afforded to go to college without such assistance. Discussions are now underway in Washington to drastically cut this program, thereby closing the door to higher education for scores of students. Funding reductions in the Pell Grant program will result in many deserving lower-income students not being able to achieve middle class status and will have huge implications for the standard of living of the entire nation.

The projected payout for the winning combination to be drawn at 11 p.m. will eclipse $500 million, Ohio Lottery officials said. A sole winner, selecting the cash option, would get around $359 million before taxes. Not bad for a one dollar investment.
This is not some Rorschach test of the glass being half full or the glass being half empty. Tigers fans are smart enough to enjoy the success while still worrying about the pitfalls that may await. And if baseball has taught us anything, its that a lot can happen over 162 games so dont get too down and dont get too cocky. Yankees apologists have reminded us many times in the last 24 hours that the last time the Yankees started 0-3 was in 1998. That year, they won 114 games and easily took their second world title in three years. (Although after watching the Yankees this weekend, that seems like sunny optimism.)

Black and Blue had chunks of sirloin-quality beef, which were complemented very well by the blue cheese.

Preston Truman Boyd, as Gaudio - the adolescent genius (not from the neighborhood) whose songs made the group's fortune - brings just the right mix of cockiness and determination to counter Valli's sweetness. John Gardiner is spot-on as the innately thuggish Tommy DeVito, the guy who started the group, recognized Valli's talent, dealt with "business" and plunged the group into deep debt with the mob. And Michael Lomenda is just quirky and unpredicatable enough as Nick Massi, Valli's early coach, who at one point just has enough.
Youngblood set an Oregon school record by flying 21 feet, 9 inches on her second attempt to win her second consecutive Pacific-10 Conference long jump title Saturday at Edwards Stadium.
Touraine is a large wine-producing province surrounding the city of Tours in the middle of the Loire valley. Sauvignon Blancs from the Loire are sometimes described as tasting like tart green gooseberries. They are also known to have the aroma of cat pee. That's right, cat pee. This is an acceptable descriptive term in the wine world, and it can be a good thing. When used to describe a Sauvignon Blanc, it refers to a kind of wild, tangy smell.

A dozen radio stations will broadcast live on Friday morning from Lola's Lakehouse, a popular restaurant.
Schwartz maintains that an abundance of alternatives can lead to perpetual stress. Additionally, expectations are high once a decision has been made, so consumers tend to inevitably be disappointed and feel remorse for having not chosen differently. What can help? Lowering expectations and agonizing less about less meaningful decisions.
"These bags have been hard on Oregon's environment and even harder on Oregon's economy," said Hass at a hearing held by the Senate Environment and Natural Resources Committee. He said that the last time Oregon faced a similar litter problem -- in 1971 -- it became the first state in the nation to pass a bottle-deposit law. He also said the plastic bags have largely eclipsed the use of paper bags, which are produced in Oregon and create jobs here.

The Hawks (46-16-3-1) pulled Carruth for an extra attacker in the final 50 seconds, but failed to generate any quality chances as they lost at home in regulation time for only the fourth time in 35 games.
Consider visiting other stadiums: It's hard to persuade a Giants or A's fan who has traveled 654 miles to go see the Milwaukee Brewers. But I would suggest at least one day at another stadium. Better yet if you can catch the Giants on the road. My three favorites are Maryvale (Brewers), Surprise (Rangers, Royals) and Peoria (Padres, Mariners).
The 5-foot-11, 160-pound Kitchen scored six goals in 25 games with the Zips. Scouts like his confidence and leadership ability along with his willingness to carry the ball forward.

"What I think bothered him the most, was the fact that he ran for Tucson and represented Arizona, but when he went other places, he couldn't eat or socialize with his peers," she said. "He couldn't understand that he fought a war, came back home, and things were the same."
Senior hurler CJ Spink locked down the Lions for seven innings to earn a 3-0 win and the Stars won their third straight game.
Chavezâs homer was New Yorkâs 37th of the season and the Yankees have failed to hit a long ball only three times through 22 games. Derek Jeter finished April with a career-high 37 hits and is one of three Yankees who have fared extremely well against Tuesday starter Brian Matusz. Jeter is batting .500 in 22 career at-bats against Matusz, while Mark Teixeira is batting .412 and Robinson Cano is hitting .409. Matusz was the losing pitcher when the Yankees won 6-2 on April 9. He allowed four runs, six hits and four walks in four innings. Orioles manager Buck Showalterâs next victory will be No. 1,000 of his career.

Lost in the buzz is the original feedback venue: the 100-year-old Better Business Bureau, which vets and investigates consumer complaints against companies—and charges fees for memberships, providing businesses that meet its standards with the right to use its seal of approval. Behind the scenes, the BBB's 116 independent branches are debating how to adapt to a world where consumers turn to the Web for business reviews by strangers.
Whatever Manning does for the Broncos before he retires, good or bad, it will no way change or taint everything he accomplished in the same division with the Colts. His past has cemented him as one of football’s all-time great passers. His future isn’t just the next, closing chapter to his career; it’s an entire sequel that’s yet to be written.
Two of the PSAL’s top offensive weapons – Folkes, The Post’s Player of the Year, from Lincoln and Hubbard, one of the city’s most dynamic wide receivers, out of John Adams – held offers from Division II C.W. Post on the one hand, but also were clinging to that Division I dream on the other. A weekend in Brookville, L.I., spent together coincidentally, changed all that.

"All of this mess is getting to me," Wornum said. "What people have been doing is making me feel guilty." He believed in himself and his son's ability to lose weight and be judged on their own merits, Wornum indicated. Just because he was "an old man," as he said, didn't mean his teammates could throw him out.
-- The trip: Sea lions, pelicans and shorebirds - and if all fails, the Monterey Bay Aquarium - is a sure thing for fish and wildlife. Sea lion numbers are often high in the summer, commonly hitting 100 to 200 and up, and shorebirds hang around the marina and docks.

A Baltimore woman I just met was almost giddy with joy when she learned I live in Manhattan; she immediately took my number. And called. Did I remember her? I did not. No matter. She needed to stay over since she'd be in New York that weekend. "I have only one room, and you would lack privacy," I suggested delicately. Does she know anyone in Queens? "I prefer Manhattan," she told me forthrightly, with that grasping air found in certain Anita Brookner characters. How could I question such a preference? Don't I prefer Manhattan?

So, over the past few years, Oldman — perhaps the only actor to play both Lee Harvey Oswald and Pontius Pilate — has tried to find a few less hissable, more mainstream parts.
The veteran rocker didn’t preach at the 90-minute Jon Bon Jovi and Friends concert. He simply told the audience what the Parker Family Medical Center means to him and to his family, praised a few doctors by name, and let the songs do the talking. Most of these were covers. Bon Jovi led a 17-piece band through enthusiastic renditions of rock standards ("Start Me Up," "So You Want to Be a Rock ’n’ Roll Star") and blues classics ("See See Rider," "634-5789"). Southside Johnny joined him for four numbers, including a convincing duet rendition of Sam and Dave’s "Hold on, I’m Comin.’ " A few of these interpretations were awkward — Bon Jovi’s industrial-strength pipes do not easily wrap around a song as sultry as "Oh, Pretty Woman." Others, like a boisterous version of "Glad All Over" by the Dave Clark Five, flashed a rare glimpse of Bon Jovi the pop geek. Only deep into the set did he turned his attention to his own material, performing hits such as "Prayer," "Wanted Dead or Alive" and "You Give Love a Bad Name."
Groundbreaking is planned for Tuesday on 8.4 acres at Broadway and Pershing Avenue, the former home of St. Michael Hospital. The bicycle track is scheduled to open June 16.

About the Blazers: Portland has won four in a row after ending a four-game road losing streak Friday in Phoenix. The Blazers had lost seven of eight on the road before the 101-94 victory against the Suns ...

It happens every year. The day of your Kentucky Derby party, you realize you only have cubed ice instead of the crushed ice needed for your mint juleps -- and so does every convenience store, since other people planned better. So once again you end up kneeling on the kitchen floor with a hammer and a bag of ice trying to do it yourself, and risking grievous harm. Give yourself a manual ice crusher this season, and don't forget to send a thank-you note next May.

If you grew up mashing potatoes by hand, grinding your own coffee with a hand grinder, storing your cheese in a wooden box or serving salt from a cellar instead of a shaker, you'll appreciate the latest exhibit at the Frenchtown Heritage Museum at 1121 N. Second St. in St. Charles.
No problems were noted that day, but the area became drier in the days after.

Ralph A. Williams, 56, told Multnomah County Circuit Judge Ed Jones that was the last straw. He picked up a butcher knife and repeatedly stabbed Sean Liam Kelly, 40, in April 2009 and finished him off with a cement block, leaving Kelly dead on a neighbor's lawn.

Regence says the price hike is necessary to cover the rising costs of medical services and prescription drugs.
Particularly at a time when public and corporate funding has shrunk, and museums increasingly depend on ticket and shop sales. "The big thing that happened in American museums in my lifetime is the adoption of a customer-service mentality,'' Parker said. "Once you start charging admission, which really didn't happen until the '60s, you are almost forced to come to grips with the fact that you're trying to build a consumer base. Museums have become so conscious of revenue, they have had to become consumer-driven. Which is both a blessing and a curse.'' To please the customers, you keep the bathrooms cleaner, put stuff they like on the cafe menu, provide benches. "But do you also then show people only the art that they're used to and know they like, or do you challenge them with things they haven't seen before and try to educate them?'' Parker asked. "You want museums to lead taste and stretch people's minds, but believe me, there are a lot of people out there telling you the things they like.''

When the Indian-run Foxwoods casino opened in Connecticut in 1992, it was the closest casino to Atlantic City — and a sure sign that more were to come. Mohegan Sun, another tribal casino, opened in Connecticut four years later. The resort responded by allowing its casinos to stay open 24 hours a day; they formerly had to close for a few hours in the wee hours of the morning. It also introduced new games like poker, keno and racing simulcasts.

You are loyal to a fault. I wish you had a little George Steinbrenner in you so you could dump Kenny Williams before he screws up your entire franchise. If Kenny is unhappy with the current team and wants to blame someone, he can look no farther than the face staring back at him in the mirror. He has no patience and trades any prospect with value for an expensive veteran, and then complains every year that the payroll is too high. If he would stick to the under-the-radar moves, he actually has a decent track record -- Jenks, Quentin and Humber to name a few.

50.1 percent: Yes, I know this is an obvious number: Lugar needs to win one vote more than 50 percent to win the GOP primary. But many other big-name GOP candidates have faced lower thresholds when facing tough challenges in recent years. For instance, with four challengers splitting the vote of tea party supporters and other disaffected conservatives in 2010, Coats was able to sneak out of the primary with only 39 percent of the vote. And embattled U.S. Rep. Dan Burton won his final primary victory in 2010 with about 30 percent of the vote, thanks to a crowded field that divvied up the other 70 percent. Lugar doesn't have a crowded field to lower the 50.1 percent bar.

Price died of a heart attack in November. Since then, there has been an outpouring of support from the musicians he inspired, and this Saturday night (March 3), they'll be doing a tribute to him at Local 269 in Manhattan. (269 East Houston St.) Jay Braun, a singer-guitarist and producer who has worked with the Mooney Suzuki, the Fiery Furnaces, and Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, and whose own band the Negatones was directly inspired by Ff, will be one of the musicians playing Price's songs. Braun wrote such a beautiful tribute to Tom Price that I'm reprinting it in full below. It explains how much Price meant to his fans and fellow rockers, and why he should never be forgotten:

Questionable Calls: The Cowboys entered the draft without a reliable No. 3 wide receiver behind Miles Austin and Dez Bryant, but waited until the fifth round to add to the position with the heady but athletically limited Coale.

While the use of Facebook for reporting may be common, it was clear to me that we had hit a nerve with the public. Once the kidnapping was over, the AJC held a newsroom training session to discuss what readers and sources might expect when we use Facebook for reporting. We talked about the necessity of making sure Facebook material is authentic. We learned that even our reporters don’t understand all the privacy settings on their own Facebook accounts, so it’s a lot to expect that a private citizen in a family crisis would.

The Packers grabbed a 14-0 lead in the second quarter. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers fumbled early in the third period and the Eagles recovered, setting up Michael Vick's 24-yard pass to Jason Avant to pull Philly to within 14-10.

In Hari Kunzru's dazzling new novel, a desert is the setting, hero and villain. It isn't the first time this landform has played such a starring role. Throughout history, deserts have had a powerful grip on the human imagination: Jesus walked one for 40 nights. Moses for 40 years. Muhammad spent his boyhood in the sand, among Bedouins. Even Coyote, the trickster god of Native American lore, darted nimbly from cactus to cactus. A desert is where bombs go up and UFOs come down, where mirages, misadventures and miracles unfold. It is siren and slayer, everything and nothing. "The desert," wrote Balzac, "is God without men."
Suddenly, as Obama is close to being inaugurated along with his emphatic pledge to close Guantanamo, the administration rushes in a mad frenzy to commence the military commission of the most notorious detainee, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged 9/11 mastermind. Doing this generated the most compelling media story line imaginable against closing Guantanamo: Finally, the 9/11 attackers get their due. But the far more significant impediment these actions created is that it is now certain that, once Obama is inaugurated, these military commissions will be in mid-stream: commenced but not yet completed.

Water art also is prominent within the complex. WET, a California company that created the dancing fountains in front of Bellagio, was commissioned to install five water features. They range from the action of Lumia, a fountain of colored arcs of streaming water crashing together at the entrance to Aria, to the serenity of Glacia, pillars of carved ice that rise up to 15 feet tall in the Crystals retail district. The eerie sounds of a "tonal poem" by the Grateful Dead's Mickey Hart plays softly in the background, adding to the ethereal experience.

SIUC nose tackle Kayon Swanson was named defensive player of the week by the College Football Performance Awards and Beyond Sports Network after recording two sacks, eight tackles and three tackles for loss in the Salukis' 42-24 loss to Ole Miss. The Salukis (1-1) have a bye this week and face Missouri State on Sept. 24. … The Lindenwood Lions (2-0) allowed just 101 yards of total offense, the second lowest total in program history, and just 1 yard in the first half, in their 67-10 victory over Graceland. Lindenwood has won nine consecutive home openers and 22 straight home regular-season games. The Lions will host St. Joseph's on Saturday at 6 p.m. … The McKendree Bearcats lost their home opener in the most heartbreaking of ways, on a field goal of the final play of the game, falling 30-27 to Malone. The Malone kicker missed on his first attempt from 40 yards but earned a second because McKendree was flagged for running into the kicker. He made the second from

"This is the least that we can do for the sacrifices they make being away from their homes and families," said Sapoff, who does not have any family members in the military. "This is just a way of giving back and supporting the troops."
At the height of the Iraq war, and after the economy rebounded after Sept. 11, 2001, the Army made its goals by repeatedly lowering its standards. That meant more troops who lacked high school diplomas, with minor criminal records or who couldn’t meet the usual weight and fitness standards.
Anybody can rent Carnegie Hall, and many orchestras -- including the big boys: Boston, Berlin, Vienna and Chicago -- regularly play there. But for regional orchestras, there's more on the line. Start with the cost. On top of day-to-day fundraising, the Oregon Symphony must raise "in the low six figures" for the trip.

Much of American business is sitting on a cash hoard. The biggest companies, those listed on the Standard & Poor's 500 index, have amassed a pile close to $1 trillion. To some, this idle pile is cause for outrage  further evidence that corporate America is evil incarnate. In this view, companies are passing up opportunities to grow, profit and hire out of sheer spite.
North Carolina wins, despite guard problems due to injury. The Tar Heels have too much punch up front although they don't seem to guard very well. Ohio, no chance. N.C. State, a puncher's chance. Kansas, a good chance but the beakers will have to play better than they have been. Purdue gave the last game away.

I really liked the look of Ochre's Arctic Pear Chandelier, but by reading the discussion surrounding it, I found out that it cost around $5,300. (This information wasn't readily available because Ochre doesn't sell directly to consumers.) Another Houzz user suggested a $400 alternative from Pottery Barn that looked similar.
At the Liberdade artisanal fair in São Paulo's Little Tokyo, visitors gorge on delicacies; giant gyozas, shrimp-stuffed tempura discs and freshly made imagawayaki cakes with purplish-red gooey azuki bean paste interiors that cost about $1.40 each. Liberdade also features a diversity of services and goods, including Japanese fortunetelling and origami mobiles.
For a sole-source contract over $100,000, council approval is required.

Top Picks Analysis: After taking giant steps towards solving their pass- rushing problem from a season ago in free agency, the Bills turned their attention to the back end of the defense at the outset of the draft. In Gilmore, the team gets a highly athletic cover man who's fast, fluid and dedicated to the game, and the high-rising former Gamecock should have no problem cracking the starting lineup as a rookie. General manager Buddy Nix stayed in the SEC to attempt to rectify Buffalo's most pressing pre-draft void, a blind-side protector for quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, with the second-round selection of Glenn. The massive lineman did play left tackle at Georgia, but there are questions as to whether he's quick enough to handle NFL speed rushers in space on that side. Nix later made a curious move to trade up two spots for Graham, a blazer and outstanding return man with suspect hands and limited strength who was generally viewed as a late-round pick.
None of that bodes well for Sacramento (10-35), which has lost five straight and is 2-11 in 2009. The Kings remained winless versus East opponents this season with a 113-97 defeat to Toronto on Sunday.

A huge, expensive, two-lane bridge for old-time transit buses mirrors transportation plans to build 19th century solutions (trains) to a 20th century problem (sprawl) in the 21st century. The modern solution would be the Street Elevator: automated electric cars summoned by smart phone from the closest drop-off. Self-driving cars being tested promise safe, clean, smooth, dense traffic so that existing roads will be adequate. As a first step, these could replace existing para-transit, as expensive as Metro and Light Rail combined, but serving 5 percent of the riders.

With a Senate committee hearing tomorrow, the General Assembly begins its debate over same-sex marriage, an issue that has closely divided the state. Polls suggest that Maryland residents support and oppose legalizing gay unions in about equal numbers. Advocates, including Gov.Martin O'Malley, met in Baltimore over the weekend in preparation for an effort to win over the crucial few votes in the House of Delegates that eluded them last year. And tonight, opponents of the measure are scheduled to rally in front of the State House in hopes of once again derailing the bill. But despite all the passion on both sides of the debate, it boils down to this: Gay marriage is a matter of fairness, of individual liberty and of strengthening Maryland families.

Gene O'Donnell, a professor of law and criminal justice at John Jay College of Law and Criminal Justice, said police, prosecutors, jurors, judges and the public are likely to give an officer the benefit of the doubt in use-of-force cases.

And, of course, honey is infinitely suitable to add to dessert. But this year you may want to forgo, or at least postpone, a rich dessert or honey cake for a refreshing "carpaccio" of paper-thin fresh fruit, drizzled with a sauce made in minutes with honey, lime, ginger and fresh mint. This is a good time to take out that kitchen mandoline from the back of the drawer, or use your sharpest knife to slice the fruit as thinly as possible.
Bassoons don't come cheap, either, and Austin wasn't able to buy his own instrument until 1971, after he'd graduated from college and won a job in the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, a position he held for nine years before his successful audition with former Cleveland Orchestra music director Lorin Maazel in 1981.

From a company perspective it's proven its value. And it's covered a wide range of territory. So it's done community events where there was no quote event, we just showed up and used Facebook and Twitter to bring people together. Our intent is to expand Nomad. You're not going to see us go from one unit to 20 units. We'll just add a unit at a time as it makes sense. But I would expect to add one perhaps two this year.

Ms. Grossman said MasterCard's goal was to create an "inferred link" to an Internet user by comparing MasterCard's information with that of other providers and "triangulating different attributes."

Although the government doubled the number of soldiers deployed in the aid effort to 100,000, it seemed overwhelmed by what's turning out to be a triple disaster. Friday's quake and tsunami damaged two nuclear reactors at a power plant on the coast, and at least one of them appeared to be going through a partial meltdown, raising fears of a radiation leak.
The Old-Time Christmas celebration at Silver Dollar City, near Branson, is one of the most festive ways to celebrate the season, and it just got tastier with the re-introduction of the park's classic fruitcakes. Long a tradition at the 1880s theme park, the fruitcakes were absent for a few years before being re-launched last year. Production is expected to be around 1,000 cakes this holiday season.

Their production in the United States was stopped in 1977 because of health and environmental concerns, but they remain in the environment for years and are still considered a health hazard.
Part of the problem may lie in the DNA of California's e-waste recycling program, in particular its reliance on tedious after-the-fact verification, and its focus on documenting minute volumes of waste.
And if the answer is "depends on what's ideal for kids," then may I submit that we need to think about a requirement that all foster parents be in a permanent, loving marriage, be under age 40, have a vibrant religious faith, college degrees, and an excellent employment history? No? Then let's rethink unleashing the cigarette police on foster parents.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Children ages 8-18 whose parents are in the military are invited to attend a free summer camp in Mendocino through the Boys and Girls Clubs of San Francisco.
It was an industrial city and a port city, a dirty city and a beautiful city.
We’ve seen Carmelo Anthony, Greg Oden, Kevin Durant and John Wall light up college basketball for one season as freshmen then go. But this year might be the best group of freshmen to hit college basketball in quite some time. Harrison Barnes — UNC’s talented wing — was the first frosh to be named to the AP’s preseason All-America team. St. Patrick product Kyrie Irving (Duke) is an ACC Player of the Year candidate and Jared Sullinger reportedly put up 40 for the Ohio State Buckeyes in a scrimmage.
Is it worth paying $7 or $8 for a fixed rate?
What happens is that the palate gets too small and the lower jaw continues to develop normally, so you end up with what's called a cross-bite in the back of your mouth. If you have a cross-bite, in most cases you have to shift your lower jaw to one side or the other in order to get your back teeth to bite.

There are millions of people trying to get noticed on the Web. And success in the new-media world depends on a lot of the same things as in the old-media universe. Just as in Hollywood, becoming a hit on the Web takes talent, effort, timing and some luck. Sex appeal is valuable, getting noticed by the "mainstream" press helps, but most important is the way Internet stars exploit the power of the Web.

That's why people refer to this part of the NFL calendar as the "silly season." Sometimes it's difficult to distinguish fact from fiction as rumors are floated on a daily basis. It's the time of year when private meetings and pro day workouts qualify as big news. At least for a day or two.
While you're there, try a scoop of pumpkin pie ice cream.
Chester said that Juniak’s shoes will not be easy for his successor to fill.
With Pierce retired and the Giants having taken on the personality of their not-so-pompous leaders — Tuck and Eli Manning — there were no brash statements Monday, either verbal or symbolic. They’re only 3-point underdogs right now, as opposed to the 12-point abyss between them and the Pats four years ago. And while they’ve been quick to play the disrespect card even when it would seem to be well tucked into the deck, this time they chose a more measured approach.
"We used to go to restaurants for our holiday parties," she says. "That meant lots of rich food. This time, we had the party here and the food was fresh, and way healthier -- we had a chef prepare it that way. And people loved it."

Few artists have a better feel for American pop culture than Joel. He is pop music's Everyman, a storyteller with a knack for writing good (sometimes great) songs that connect with the masses. From "Piano Man" to "No Man's Land," his best work provides a vivid - sometimes serious, sometimes humorous - snapshot of life in middle America.
"I don't take many cases because they're so time-intensive," says Gaff. Legal aid lawyers look for cases where homeowners can afford to make payments - if given a break - or where the bank seeks foreclosure illegally.
A measure of new orders jumped to its highest level in a year. That could point to faster production in the coming months. New export orders also rose, which could offset worries that Europe and China could drag on exports.

61. San Francisco 49ers: Amini Silatolu, Midwestern State, G: Silatolu could become an immediate starter for the 49ers if Trent Baalke makes the move at this point. Silatolu is still raw and unrefined in several aspects of his game but would be a nice value pick for the 49ers in the second round.
It’s been known for centuries that the Sun’s level of activity is a changeable thing. From 2005 to 2010, we saw nothing much happening on the solar surface. Days would go by without a single sunspot or flare.
The Foundation came in with an offer of $4 million; its representatives, including Regional Arts Commission chairman Donna Wilkinson, have said they expected to negotiate. Instead, Brashear responded by trying to sell them Gateway's two outstate rimshot stations, with signals which do not penetrate to St. Louis County, and an HD channel on KFUO's license, for $5 million in what he termed a "win-win-win."

Some might think that image is corny. Touchy-feely. Or that it has nothing to do with executing an offense or winning basketball games.
I suspect those findings are pretty typical of the current marketplace: Your best deals are on connecting itineraries. Discount retail agencies get their tickets on the big lines through wholesale consolidators, and although the lines that supply these consolidators do not want to "dilute" their own nonstop markets, they're perfectly willing to undercut competitors' nonstops fares on itineraries that require connections. Thus, for example, you'll find flights to Paris via London cheaper than London nonstops and flights to London via Paris cheaper than nonstops to Paris. Quite a few of the lower-priced quotes for my test trip used US Airways flights connecting over Charlotte or Philadelphia and Air Canada trips connecting over Toronto.
California Rep. Darrell Issa, the top Republican on the committee, asked Towns to subpoena the New York Fed after the Fed blocked a separate request for documents.
Ben Connable, a former Camp Pendleton Marine who works as an analyst for RAND Corp., cautioned that the metrics in the Pentagon report do not necessarily include enough context to indicate whether the coalition is winning or losing. A drop in violence, for instance, may stem from the temporary withdrawal of insurgents or coalition forces from an area and not a sustainable peace.

"It was an overwhelming, 'Go forward,'" Stanley says.
Scott registered 11/2 of NU's six "sacks" — two hands on the quarterback is all it took. Still, the six (two by Deonte Gibson) in 45 pass plays is a great sign for a team that downed the quarterback just 17 times last season.
Both are Giants fans, and Mark Kelly said he brought an Eli Manning football jersey on his last space shuttle mission, where the astronauts took photos with Earth in the background.
“The Children’s Hour,” an award-winning play written by Lillian Hellman in 1934, is definitely a play worth talking about, said Flaster, the show’s director.
Space is limited in a small entryway, therefore it is important to choose furniture that can provide multiple solutions. The entryway organization system shown here utilizes coat hooks, entryway shoe storage, cubbies and drawers to make the most of a small space. Where no defined entry to a room exists, create a sense of a foyer with a freestanding unit like our Brady Entryway System.

Miller said Adams did attend the traffic session. Asked whether Adams attended the luncheon, Miller initially said: "Yeah, present." But when asked if he was certain, he said: "This is my recollection. I reserve the right to be wrong. Obviously, when I say it's my recollection, I mean it's my recollection."

About a third of undergraduate students have subsidized Stafford loans, which are awarded based on economic need. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 gradually reduced the rates for subsidized loans for undergraduate students from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent through 2012-13.
Voters were less divided on other key issues. Fifty-three percent said Obama was best poised to handle international affairs, compared to 36% who said Romney. Conversely, when asked which man would do a better job of reducing the federal deficit, 51% said Romney and 38% said Obama.
"The popular books they print in the hundreds of thousands, we're very selective with those," said owner and book buyer Ray Hinst Jr. "If you've got relatively unique things, then we can look at that by appointment. A first edition of Huckleberry Finn, there are a few places you should take it before getting rid of it at a garage sale." (Someone recently brought in such a volume, the holy grail in used books, to Haslam's. Hinst marveled at it but didn't offer the tens of thousands it's worth.)
You won't hear studios trashing Cinea's efforts out loud because being against any effort to combat piracy in Hollywood these days is like saying people shouldn't be allowed to drive a Prius alone in the carpool lane. But some studios are quietly exploring other alternatives.
As the bride, it's important to send a thank-you card to each guest and to provide a thoughtful gift to the hostess.
Facing up or stepping back, with his height and reach, with his habit of jumping into fadeaways off one leg, with his other knee crooked to create more space, with his body canted far backward, with his high-arching, soft shot -- Nowitzki was simply unstoppable.
After a scramble in front of the Tigers net, the loose puck popped out to Burton in the left slot, and he sent a beautiful wrist shot through traffic and past Sawyer for his team-leading 23rd goal of the season and a 2-0 lead.
"I'm just waiting for them to lock me up," he says. "I don't see no other way of me repaying that debt."

These projections are mostly speculation, forged by reading between the lines of press conference transcripts, following trends of how they operate in the draft, and conversations I have had my fiancée, a New England native who thinks Randy Moss still plays for the Patriots and goes on tandem bicycle rides with Tom Brady through the streets of Boston. In other words, don’t take these as gospel. These are just semi-educated guesses.
Overnight, the area was hit by up to 1.5 inches of rain in spots and more is coming today, thanks to a cold front that’s working its way through the area.
"That was a nightmare," Brett Wyatt says. "Nobody really understood what we were doing."
That strategy continued this year. There were, in Anne Hathaway and James Franco, the two youngest hosts in Academy history (who made several self-conscious jokes about appealing to that “younger demographic” with the “young and hip Oscars”). There were pointless CGI “scenic transitions” to movie moments of the past.
Stewart jokes that it was a sign when three different people called her attention to the manager's job at the Hillsboro Community Senior Center after longtime manager Shelah Jett-Lompa announced her retirement last year.
Reid then walked the rest of the Eagles' decision-makers through his thought process. He always considered Castillo one of his best - if not the best - position coach. He had come to the conclusion, after 12 years of working together, that Castillo had a keen defensive mind. And he thought the 51-year-old would bring the necessary energy and aggressiveness to the position.
THE ISSUE: All states test students at least once a year in reading and math in grades 3 through 8 and grade 11. California, in addition, tests students in grades 2, 9 and 10. It also tests students in science, history and physical fitness above grade 4. It requires an "exit exam" for high school graduation. Gov. Jerry Brown wants to reduce the number of tests.
Poplar Bluff was the last team to win back-to-back titles. The Mules won in 2004 and '05.
The book and film not only bring her back into the squall that toppled her boat, but will also roil anew the controversy surrounding Sunderland, her family and her trip. Her parents came under fire for supporting the admittedly dangerous undertaking (their daughter had only a 24-hour solo stint before setting sail) and then trying to cash in on their ordeal with reality TV tie-ins.
"Nothing stays the same. Wildlife tends to move to where conditions are right for the time," Stewart said. "But the people who are complaining forget that we had four very bad springs in a row for nesting, and while we had that good weather in March, this year it got cold and rainy again in April.
The two newest Disney Cruise Line ships were manufactured by the Meyer Werft shipyard in Papenburg, Germany. Both are 1,115 feet long with room for 4,000 passengers.

Low mortgage rates haven't translated into higher home sales. Mortgage applications have dropped over the past few weeks, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
Niky Roberts, who works in public relations in St. Louis, was one of the lucky ducks to nab some Missoni. She was in Springfield, Mo., on business, so she went straight to a Target there after she was done with work. The store had been mostly cleaned out by then, but upon the suggestion of a fellow shopper, she checked out the children's section, where she found an extra-large sweater.
Access to college is also an issue. The state's community colleges have the most students in the post-secondary program, according to Ohio Department of Education statistics.

The district will take a more aggressive approach to keep kids from leaving, Adams said. A team will go to Bunche, Stevens and Big Picture and begin recruiting them for other city schools.
Asked what he got from the brief meeting, Pill said, "Just that we're a good team and it's just a matter of time, that we've had some bad luck, we've gotten guys on and we just haven't scored them. Just keep working hard, stay with it, have fun and don't get down.
Mass protests against Assad erupted in March 2011, but gradually turned into an insurgency in response to a violent regime crackdown. Assad's regime denies it faces a popular uprising, claiming it is being targeted by a foreign-led terrorist conspiracy.

Sparkling wine is generally considered a beverage for celebrations, special occasions or as an aperitif. It shouldn't be. With a little planning, sparkling wines, especially those in the widely available, food-friendly brut style, can enhance your holiday meal from start to finish. There's no need to uncork more than one style of bubbly.
But how would the researchers compare two justices -- say Hugo Black and William Rehnquist -- who never served together? One answer was Justice Potter Stewart, who served with both and thus becomes a good reference point. By placing Justice Stewart on an ideological spectrum, they could compare him to both Justice Black, who was more liberal, and Justice Rehnquist, who was more conservative.

"The HIV treatment community sees the act as a critical step in our fight against the AIDS epidemic," said Scott Schoettes of Lambda Legal, a national gay-rights advocacy group.

1. Decide where you're going to exercise. This will dictate the exercises for your strengthening program. You don't need to join a health club; simply having an adjustable bench and dumbbells at home will enable you to perform more than 160 exercises. A perk of health clubs is the social aspect, which some people enjoy. If you're going to join a health club, insist on a month-to-month contract so you're not locked into something long-term that you could eventually not use.

Schiller talks about new iPad's better battery life, saying it will last for ten hours, which brings more applause from the crowd. The new iPad will last nine hours running on a 4G network, Schiller says, "yet it remains amazingly thin and amazingly light at 1.4 pounds."
In general, though, "The Columnist" doesn't manage to make Alsop's particular case, and, granted, he was a particular case, quite enough of a metaphor for the American moment. We're not allowed to feel and think beyond the biography. That issue is exacerbated by classy but very careful and gentle production from director Dan Sullivan that uses dignified, measured transitions to capture the affluence of Alsop's upper-class, Georgetown milieu, but never allows Lithgow or his foes to fully let loose. For sure, these were wound-tight personalities dedicated to propriety, and this articulate cast surely captures that element of the national discourse. Still, one finds oneself wanting a couple more of these very civilized scenes - especially those between Lithgow and Margaret Colin, who plays Susan Mary Alsop, an in-name-only wife - to descend into staccato rage.
A few days later, he went to urgent care for testing.

I marvel at the uniformity of style on the series. Set in the early 1960s, every man sports a hat and a beige raincoat, and every woman has a cinched waist and bright red lips. No matter the economic status or background of the characters, he or she generally conforms to the look of the day. There are a few faint cracks in the fa ade -- the hippies are coming! -- but it's remarkable to witness how much the national fashion psyche has changed in just a few short decades.
