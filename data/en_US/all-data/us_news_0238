Nearly a decade ago I was on a national trends panel in New York where experts were predicting Indian food would be the Next Big Thing. It was a logical leap and made perfect sense. After all, Asian Indians are a significant immigrant group in the United States, particularly in Silicon Valley, and our polyglot culture has developed a palate for the type of spicy, full-flavored foods characteristic of Indian cooking.

Manage any pain with anti-inflammatory medications. Rest the arm by using a sling during the daytime. Begin rehabilitating the joint with shoulder exercises and physical therapy. This will restore your normal motion and strengthen healthy portions of the rotator cuff tendon which will result in pain relief.
Hari Sevugan, a spokesman for the 500,000-member StudentsFirst — which was formed in December and hopes to raise $1 billion — said it "can bring to the table a national platform," while complementing what he called the local group’s "strong foothold in New Jersey."

My wife and I ordered a specialty pizza, Smoked Chicken Pesto ($14.99). The medium-thick dough was nice and light with a crispy crust and no greasiness. Excellent, moist chicken breast pieces, filled with smoky flavor, were generously piled on top. If anything, the kitchen was a little too generous with a crumbly goat-cheese topping. The cheese gave the dish even more explosive flavor, but made it a little dry. Next time I'll join the crowd and try the traditional red-sauce pizza.

Everyone there followed JoPa's lead. "If the old man isn't concerned, why should anyone else be, right?", they thought. Well, they thought WRONG! It's just a sad situation.

Like Defoe's books, the film is stuffed with absurd anachronisms, broad comedy and sly asides aimed at older audiences. Quite a lot of plot rejiggering was required as the film jettisoned much of Defoe's book. The original subtitle was "An Adventure With Scientists," and the antagonist was Darwin's archenemy, the "evil," "nefarious," "black-hearted" Bishop of Oxford. Anticlerical satire is sheer heresy for the American multiplex, and like Philip Pullman's dark fantasy "The Golden Compass" before it, this film has been gutted and jerry-built to avoid a culture-war tizzy. If I had a plank handy, I'd make the yellow-belly behind that decision walk it.

However he'd be just as overqualified for that one as he is for All-Joe after churning out a team record 1,536 receiving yards. Jordy Nelson, Packers - How a guy scores 15 TDs in the season after he was a Super Bowl hero and gets shut out of postseason honors is beyond us … but we'll gladly take him. Marques Colston, Saints - Yes, we're sure, he's never been a Pro Bowler despite five 1,000-yard seasons in his six-year career. Call him a byproduct of the New Orleans' passing offense at your own risk. Just make sure you call him tough after a broken collarbone suffered in Week 1 kept him out all of two weeks. Laurent Robinson, Cowboys - Basically walked off the street to sub for injured Miles Austin and scored 11 TDs for Dallas after reaching the end zone four times in his first four seasons. Doug Baldwin, Seahawks - How many undrafted rookies have led their team in receptions and receiving yards since the merger? It's a club of one, and Baldwin is the charter member. Darrius Heyward-Bey, Raiders - Blew up for 975 receiving yards, better than any season ever produced by Michael Crabtree, the man Oakland was blasted for bypassing to draft DHB in 2009.

He said Terrell could swim but suffered a seizure.
I've been preparing to be a grandma ever since the first of our two children got married. Actually, before that.

øNadal's dominant victory continued one streak - he's won that tournament eight consecutive years! - and ended the other. Mercifully. We say that not because we root for one (Nadal or Djokovic) against the other.

No doubt, the "for-cause" negotiation waltz is common for abruptly departing public officials, who often threaten legal action if they get what they perceive to be a raw deal.

Clearly, the incident falls well short of the "constitutional crisis" that the more breathless right-wing commentators have suggested in recent days.

The last time the Giants and 49ers faced each other in the playoffs - well, OK, I think all Big Blue fans know what happened there. Before this season, that gut-wrenching 24-point collapse on Jan. 5, 2003 was the last time San Francisco had won a playoff game. 49ers 39, Giants 38.
"For a guy like me, there is absolutely no reward for going to work out because I don't know where I'm going to be," said backup running back Garrett Wolfe, who also attended the charity event. "If I knew I was going to be back with the Bears, it would be a great reward because I'm working with my teammates and we're becoming better as an offense. But I don't have the slightest idea whether I'm going to be back with Chicago or whether I'm going to be with some other team. If you're not under contract, it's all risk."

Cut the orange segments in half, and divide evenly between the four servings of fish. Top with dollops of the aioli and serve any extra at the table.
Some think the Iran issue is already seeping into the prospective election campaign. The highly personal nature of the criticism from former security chief Diskin, in particular, had led some to view it as more of a political attack than a policy dispute, perhaps the first salvo in an electoral battle in which Iran could become a heated issue. Diskin said he had "no faith" in Netanyahu and would not want him "at the wheel" during an Iranian operation.

"The game was similar to the last time," Timberland coach Abe Raziq said. "Both teams played extremely hard. We got a goal and they tied it. This time we were able to finish on that big second goal. I thought we did a better job defensively this time around. You'vegot to give Holt credit. Their offense was pressuring like crazy at the end but our defense was just better, in my opinion."
Alike is so persuasively played by newcomer Adepero Oduye that for long passages of Dee Rees' Pariah, an exhilarating coming-of-age-and-coming-out feature debut, it feels like cinema verite.

She had always prided herself on making strong, deliberate choices. And long ago, she had chosen to create a life of meaning through her art, her writing, her thoughtful examination of the world around her. Now she was feeling uncertain about all that had once seemed so certain. What if children were the ultimate act of creation? Weren't they the very reason for our existence in the first place -- our biological imperative, if you got down to it? If you didn't have a child, were you missing out on your fundamental purpose in this life? Was everything else simply pointless and indulgent?

In taking on one of Shakespeare's more opaque plays for his directorial debut, Ralph Fiennes emulates the hero he portrays, a refractory Roman general, Caius Martius "Coriolanus," for whom compromise equals surrender. But Martius comes to a bad end, while Mr. Fiennes achieves a great beginning. As a director, his grasp exceeds his daring reach, and his performance stands as a chilling exemplar of psychomartial ferocity.

Consumer advocates have been lobbying against the deal since late last year, arguing that the damage wrought by lenders was far larger than the amount the banks had offered to settle the claims against them.

What is needed is to pay attention to the common theme of the testimony of proponents of same-sex marriage. Then: Educate the general public and, specifically, health care providers; require software upgrades, if necessary (at hospitals, for example), so a “couple in a civil union” can be entered and recognized in a computer system; and finally, enforce the existing civil union law.
