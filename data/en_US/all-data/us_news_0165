This week, Republicans have been criticizing President Obama for his surprise trip to Afghanistan marking the one-year anniversary of the killing of Osama bin Laden. By accusing the president of hyping the commemoration, they apparently hope to undercut the political potency of his biggest foreign policy coup. Instead, the GOP critics may merely make themselves look a bit silly.

Understand a little about how the dish you want will be prepared. Granted, now is not the time for a cooking lesson. Still, asking a simple question or two can provide a lot of useful information -- information you can play off of. Say, "Am I able to substitute steamed vegetables for the pasta?" or "Would the kitchen be willing to use a broiled chicken breast instead of a fried cutlet for the parmigiana?"

The nexus of this was in 1955 when Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman wrote a paper titled "The Role of Government in Education."

WASHINGTON -- A closely divided Supreme Court on Thursday swept away long-standing limits on campaign spending by unions and corporations.
Rocq's French training and previous stints at Tradition by Pascal, Aubergine and Pinot Provence are easy to spot in the European menu. Most notable of the entrees is chicken cordon bleu ($10.95). The plump, breaded chicken breast comes covered in a peppery gravy. With the touch of a knife, molten cheese oozes out. Each bite is salty and savory, and I try to mop up every bit of gravy with the already moist chicken. Greens in a simple vinaigrette round out the plate.
Seattle could use another strong effort from the two-time All-Star in order to beat the Indians for the fifth time in six tries. A victory would also give the Mariners their first series win against them at home since sweeping a three-game set from April 22-24, 2003.

Their influence on American history and culture is intense, and the authors have collected hundreds of art, artifacts and other ephemera relating to their activities and practices, most of which really weren't that secret.

I've said this before and I'll say it again: The only reason college basketball remains relevant is because of the spectacle, not the sport.

First, amending the Constitution is not necessary to balance the budget — and won't actually move us any distance toward that goal in the short run. Second, there is a real risk that this feel-good action will undermine market confidence in Congress' ability to do its job, while justifying public cynicism about Washington — thus making it harder for future legislators to work us out of the fiscal corner we're in.

In Missouri, regional public universities compete for funding. Local state lawmakers fight for "their" school rather than treating the university system as a unified state asset.

In discussing "Namibia" by phone, Burnett admits the scale of this project was larger than the intimate tales of African American life he's previously filmed, but that ultimately the process was similar.

Lowdown: Alonso is a wild card who could pay off huge or continue to disappoint. Alonso missed last season with a knee injury and twice has landed in coach Chip Kelly's doghouse for alcohol-related incidents and subsequently has been suspended indefinitely. Kelly said at Pacific-12 Conference media day that academic and behavioral issues needed to be addressed before Alonso's status could be updated.

Alonso, who will compete with senior Dewitt Stuckey, would give the Ducks a middle linebacker with the prototypical physical attributes of a potential first-round pick. Providing he can keep his nose clean and his head in the game.

Bisard is on suspension and awaiting trial on charges of reckless homicide and criminal recklessness. Police and prosecutors allege he was drunk when he hit the bikers.
In truth, being an angel is probably the best part of any church Christmas pageant, though it sometimes doesn't seem that way. Much acclaim is lauded on the shepherds and the late arriving magi, and of course every youngster yearns to land the parts of either Mary or Joseph. But Mary and Joseph don't usually say much, and the shepherds often appear a bit befuddled by the hoopla. Angels, however, enter the stage boldly and confidently, bearing announcements of great joy. Angels are the train conductors of the Christmas story, keeping the story orderly and moving along, appearing at regular intervals throughout both Matthew and Luke's birth narratives. They assure Mary that God has chosen her, sing joyous choruses in the heavens at the baby's birth, and warn Joseph to flee Herod's wrath.

On a table in front of his mirror sits his mustache. It's actually a small disk of Ben Nye brand makeup - CL-29 Black, if you must know - that Borle slathers over his upper lip at least three times during the show because his sweaty antics make it drip off. Of perhaps growing his own mustache for the part he says: "It was never in the cards, which is fortunate because I don't grow a lustrous beard."

The fact that Cohanzick will be closing its doors is something the schools have been expecting, they just weren’t expecting to hear about it right before the season started.
It was a quick trip, with just enough time to see the new museum's current exhibition of Russian Orthodox Church art that lasts until mid-September, to be followed by a couple of blockbusters: Flemish painters from the Hermitage, with masterpieces by Van Dyck, Jordaens and Rubens (including his stunning "Descent From the Cross"), opening Sept. 17; and in the fall of next year, Impressionist and Post-Impressionist artworks from the vast St. Petersburg collection, together with 75 works by Vincent Van Gogh, temporarily homeless while the city's Van Gogh Museum closes for renovation from September 2012 to March 2013.
These were the teams of our formative years, and perhaps of yours. These were the years that the drafts were comically poor, the weekends that Ron Johnson’s brilliance was tragically undermined by the stumbling antics of his supporting cast, and the autumns that our dads and older brothers spent cursing at a black-and-white Zenith.
is a price for going all in with one player for such an extended time, and the Colts are about to pay it. That is not written to undervalue the rewards reaped from No. 18. Whatever the toll for his neck injury, back pain, potentially lengthy stay on the sideline and Indy's unpreparedness for his absence - and I think the penalties could be steep - you can argue Manning was well worth it. Manning's value to and impact on Indianapolis exceeds Michael Jordan's to Chicago, Brett Favre's to Green Bay, Muhammad Ali's to Louisville, and Larry Bird's to Boston."

I am sure the next two beaches will get even heavier promotion. Most of Dr. Beach's picks over the years have been state parks or remote sand strands. But Coronado is in front of the Hotel del Coronado and adjacent to the eighth largest city in the U.S. Kahanamoku is the beach in front of the Hilton Hawaiian Village. That's the kind of publicity that makes a marketing department salivate – the "only hotel on the best beach in America."

"Two, it's one of the most beloved and most famous," he added. "Three, it's more about interaction between the various characters.

"The Scream" that is up for sale is the third and most vibrantly colored of four versions the Norwegian artist made between 1893 and 1910. It's the only one not already in either the National Gallery in Oslo or that city's Munch Museum. Although conceived when Munch was living in Berlin, Oslo is where the image's icy fjord, undulating landscape, bleeding sky and visually raked bridge -- a favorite local spot for suicide, like the span over San Francisco's Golden Gate -- are located. All four versions are on board, not canvas. Besides the pastel, two of the other paintings were made with tempera and the remaining one was made with crayon.

It was a magical summer as we attended an Aerosmith concert, went to the lake, etc. As I said, she was very cute but she wore a baseball cap pulled down on her wavy, brunette hair obscuring her face.

The photos were published in Wednesday's Los Angeles Times. One shows members of the 82nd Airborne Division posing in 2010 with Afghan police and the severed legs of a suicide bomber. The same platoon a few months later was sent to investigate the remains of three insurgents reported to have accidentally blown themselves up - and soldiers again posed and mugged for photographs with the remains, the newspaper said. A photo from that incident appears to show the hand of a dead insurgent resting on a U.S. soldier's shoulder as the soldier smiles. Top U.S. military and civilian officials rushed to condemn the soldiers' actions Wednesday, calling them repugnant and a dishonor to others who have served in the conflict. The Army said an investigation is under way.

It's 850-488-7146. Speaking of which, the last time I spoke to the governor by phone, it didn't go so well. I had left a message for him a couple of weeks ago. And the next morning, my cell phone rang — at 6:25 a.m. Usually I'm up by 6. But this day, I was in the midst of deep sleep. So I hear the ring, fly out of bed like my sheets were on fire and answer the phone in a voice that sounded like a bullfrog with a mouthful of gravel. "This is … um … Scott." On the other end is a voice peppier than a high-school cheerleader: "Hi Scott!! It's Charlie Crist! I know it's early! But I was up and running! So I thought I'd call now! I didn't wake you, did I?" I'm not sure what it is about that question that makes us all lie. But we do. And I did, saying something about how I'd been up for hours and had already run a few errands. Then we did the interview. Whatever that man drinks in the morning should be illegal.

Perhaps it's true, as the narrator of "Winged Migration" posits, that the essential bird narrative is "a story of a promise -- a promise to return." And then again, maybe that says more about documentary narrators and their audiences than it does about the white storks, Eurasian cranes and Arctic terns that go soaring across the farmlands, forests and cityscapes in "Migration." The fact is we don't really know what animals are thinking or feeling (if that's what they do), and that's also what makes them so alluring.

5. When observers talk about Yadier Molina's improved power production, they invariably mention his increased home-run total in 2011, when he hit a career-high 14 homers. Take a look at the doubles. To me, Molina's rising double count is more indicative of his power stroke. Sure, he hits more homers than he did as a young player. But Molina's gap power has grown, and he just hits the ball harder and farther than he used to. The doubles prove that. Molina hit 32 doubles last season and already has 10 a month into 2012. Since the start of last season Molina's 42 doubles are the most among MLB catchers, and his slugging percentage of .484 is second among catchers to Detroit's Alex Avila (.493.) What a bonus this is for the Cardinals, to have baseball's best defensive catcher evolve into a productive and important hitter.

Analysts believe that May results will offer more clarity on the consumers' mindset.

The practical effect is to make it nearly impossible for the state prosecutor to be able to prove that a legislator took money for his or her vote. All that is left is for the federal courts to try a state legislator who is accused of breaking a federal law, because the U.S. Supreme Court has held that a state legislative privilege has no force in a federal prosecution. (This is happening now with the case against state Sen. Ulysses Currie. But we are having to rely on the federal government to prosecute him. Shouldn't Maryland be able to keep its own house in order?)

And it is sickening that Americans for Prosperity would have the nerve to pull this kind of tactic in Delray, part of the Southwest Detroit community that Moroun has treated as an industrial wasteland. The raggedy properties he owns and refuses to maintain in that neighborhood are the foundation for much of the blight that has made Delray such a mess for years and robbed residents of a decent quality of life.

At issue is the publishers' decision to stop selling ebooks wholesale to the likes of Amazon and Barnes & Noble and to shift to the "agency" approach proposed by Apple. Under the original system, publishers sold ebooks to retailers at about half the cover price and let the retailers determine what to charge consumers for them. Amazon had been selling popular new e-books at a loss — and, to the publishers' chagrin, at a far lower price than hardback editions — to promote sales of its Kindle reader. The agency model, by contrast, requires retailers to charge the price set by the publisher, while allowing them to keep 30% of the sales revenue.
