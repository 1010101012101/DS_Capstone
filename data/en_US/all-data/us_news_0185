If originality were the sole criterion, "Once" would have the best musical Tony in the bag. The family-friendly "Newsies" is infinitely more derivative. (Imagine the score for "Annie" revised by Oscar glutton Alan Menken, who's up for an award with "Newsies" lyricist Jack Feldman in the chronically anemic best score category.)

First I went back to the story of Romeo and Juliet and found a part that inspired me. When I hit the scene where Juliet finds Romeo dead, lyrics immediately started to come to me. It's a powerful scene and the emotions that Juliet was feeling at that time were perfect to fuel a song. It's almost a stream of consciousness from Juliet's perspective.

The film academy's decision to stay in Hollywood follows months of discussions with other entertainment complexes, including AEG's L.A. Live, which was trying to lure the lucrative broadcast to its site downtown. With its 7,100-seat Nokia Theatre that hosts both the Emmy Awards and the American Music Awards, plus its large outdoor area and three ballroom options, L.A. Live was seen by some as an appealing alternative to the more congested Hollywood locale.

Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. wireless carrier, began offering the iPhone in February. AT&T prepared for the loss of its exclusivity by cutting the price of the older 3GS model in January by half for contract customers and adding devices such as the Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.

Nashville: The Predators suspended forwards Alexander Radulov and Andrei Kostitsyn for Game 3 tonight of their Western Conference semifinal with the Phoenix Coyotes. General manager David Poile and coach Barry Trotz said the decision to punish the forwards for violating unspecified team rules was easy. The general manager is leaving the decision on whether the men return for Game 4 on Friday night up to Trotz. Poile refused to specify what Radulov and Kostitsyn did, saying any hint would give away what they did. He called their behavior unfortunate and selfish. Nashville trails Phoenix, 0-2, in a series.

The City Council last year considered letting private firms take over its liquor business, but a consultant's study reinforced how profitable the business is and the idea was dropped. The business has contributed $4.5 million to city projects from 2006 through last year and has provided a loan of nearly $400,000 so remodeling could begin this spring on the city's new Heritage Center for seniors, veterans and history buffs. The money is to be repaid when the old senior center is sold and fundraising for the new center is completed.

“Recognizing that the state is going to have an unexpected revenue increase and the Governor's call for ‘shared sacrifice,’ the Legislature needs to ensure that the sacrifice will truly be shared, including the consideration of a millionaire's tax.

Safety an issue at Kentucky, too: One significant problem seemed to get overlooked in the whole bru ha ha over parking at Kentucky Speedway: There were a number of spots that didn't have protective soft wall barriers. That's a disconcerting sign for drivers, and it should be an obvious immediate fix for track officials. Having a driver seriously hurt or killed at their next even would be a tragedy _ far more painful than a bunch of fans disappointed with the traffic snarl.

"It's also something that's based on wants, not something that's based on needs," Achenbach said. "We still have one school in Collinsville that has students in portable classrooms.

More than a century old, this 4-plus-acre find tucked away in a working-class section of the West Side feels like a locals-only secret; a 2011 hailstorm caused tremendous damage, but they're up and running while repairs continue. A must on any winter Windy City itinerary.
Aldridge is the centerpiece in almost all of them. If his defender is guarding him from the side or in front when he's positioned in the low post, Aldridge has the option to spin away toward the basket, elevate in the open space and gather the lob. Hence the name "spin lob." The point guard, typically Miller, reads the play as it's happening, always carrying the knowledge that an alley-oop can surface at any point.

Part of the success comes from the fact that 1972 is alien not just to him, but to us. So mixed in there is an early-'70s spoof, of the drugs and the counterculture, and of Wishnick dolls, lava lamps and board games. In one scene, in the midst of a self-pitying rant, Barnabas rests his head on what appears to be a piano. But no, it's an organ, of a type that was popular in that era, and his head triggers one of the device's recorded backbeats.

6. Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (1973) Billy the Kid: Kris is the young gunslinger being chased by an aging sheriff, well-played by James Coburn.

Madison is an adorable 2-month-old black Labrador retriever-mix who was found as a tiny stray puppy. Fortunately, she was rescued by an animal-loving family, who nurtured her until an AWA foster home became available. Madison is now a very happy, high-energy puppy, who tries to run in all directions at once, as she explores her new surroundings. Her first real adventure involved testing the water in the pond for swimming. In the past eight weeks, Madison has been working on her house manners and crate training. Madison is healthy, current on all age appropriate shots, and is spayed and microchipped. For more information, call the AWA at 636-297-0486, or email Madison's foster mom Pat at startingover@centurytel.net.

The initiative is clearly modeled on Proposition 71, which eight years ago moved the state into the medical research business in a big way by creating a stem-cell agency with $3 billion in bond funding. This page endorsed that initiative. But at the time, underPresidentGeorge W. Bush, the federal government was shirking its responsibility to properly fund embryonic stem-cell research and was tying the hands of researchers by limiting them to existing, less useful stem-cell lines. In addition, Proposition 71 provided a defined amount of money for research — Proposition 29 would spend far more over the years — and created a structure under which the state and its taxpayers could share in royalties and licenses from new discoveries. It remains to be seen whether the state will reap that supposed bounty, but at least it made sense to hope that California might become a national center for embryonic stem-cell research.
Not only will Friday’s concert by Detroit groovers Electric Six be the latest First Ave gig recorded for a live album, but it will also be the first to feature the club’s new sound system. Burnsville’s own Electro-Voice audio company installed the gear earlier in the week, about a decade after the previous system was put in. The new equipment is reportedly more energy efficient and way more “intelligent” in its sonic delivery. First Ave g.m. Nate Kranz couldn’t name the price tag, but he admitted, “It was very expensive.”
Suddenly, CNN began broadcasting reports of the school shooting in Chardon, Ohio. My prayer focus turned from my own concerns to that emerging tragedy.

I prayed for teenagers who are transformed into murderers, and students who instantly changed into statistics.

But Bynum's breakthrough season still got him enough votes to tie with Detroit's second-year center Greg Monroe for fourth behind Ryan Anderson, Ersan Ilyasova and Nikola Pekovic. Bynum probably should have been ahead of Monroe, as one first-place vote went to the similar-sounding Andrew Bogut, who hardly played this season.

Capri's rural areas are the main allure for some visitors to the island, who come to hike and commune with nature instead of hitting the shops. Miles of ancient trails crisscross the countryside, stone pathways that are marked by the wear of 2,000 years of foot traffic. Smart travelers hike these charming, lonely trails from 11 a.m. to 4 or 5 p.m. each day while day-trippers swarm the island and clog the streets of Capri Town and Anacapri.

Tiny storefront, just off Broad Street near Military Park, with big value on the menu; the $5.99 lunch special includes an ample-sized entrée, plus rice and veggies. Can’t beat that anywhere. Recommended: the Cubano sandwich and the pan con lechon (marinated roast pork and toasted bread).
"The Raven" has John Cusack, and it has Edgar Allan Poe. It has other things not quite as good. The story has its moments, and yet there is something about this tale of a serial killer's patterning his crimes on Poe's most gruesome works that doesn't completely satisfy.

The consumer economics of this venture are also a big risk for Sony. The Vita is retailing on launch day for $249 with WiFi, and $300 with WiFi and 3G capability. While Vita is backwards compatible with PSP games, new Vita-specific titles will cost you anywhere from $30-$50. Given how many free and cheap games are available on the App Store and Android markets, the proposition of a Vita and half a dozen games versus a smartphone could be considered a virtual wash.
Shelley Duncan said his father, who played for the Indians in 1973-74, hadn't seen him play "since college." Baseball season has always meant being in different camps and on different teams for the Duncans. Dave has been the Cardinals' pitching coach since 1995.

Photos reveal images of a slender girl showing off her ink near a Crush soda machine. Another female student reveals the word "Truth" tattooed on her inner lower lip. Another, standing near green reference books in the Wimberly Library, rolled up his right shirt sleeve to show a crucifix on his shoulder.

Some people have already been complaining that the champion-versus-champion match became a backdrop to the Laurinaitis-Long issues. I admit, I found the camera's focus on the commentary table during the early stages of the match to be annoying, but as my friend Greg DeMarco tweeted, "Sometimes chaos works." This was one of those times. That was one of the strongest openings to Raw yet this year.
Within a mile of these three schools, there are about 3,200 buildings that the city has marked for demolition, but there isn't enough funding. There are 1,010 targeted for demolition by 2013, and 515 have been demolished since January 2010 -- when Mayor Dave Bing's current term began -- and February 2012 , a Free Press analysis shows. The city's priority is demolishing dangerous buildings within 400 yards of a school, but it has expanded that to 1,760 yards -- 1 mile -- in the three pilot areas, even though money remains scarce.

There is one Biblical verse that most Christians agree upon during this time of year.
The Browns have often had good punters (Chris Gardocki, Dave Zastudil, Hodges), possibly because they have gotten so much practice at it with their offense. After Hodges' injury, McGee is the only punter in camp. He is also the holder on Dawson's field-goal tries. It is the first time he has been a regular holder.

California Occupational Safety and Health Administration spokesman Peter Melton told the newspaper that the man had been handling a bacteria linked to bloodstream infections at the VA Hospital's Northern California Institute for Research and Education.
Although Mason has never been personally implicated in the county corruption scandal, some of his closest political allies have been -- and even fair-minded observers wonder how a prosecutor so politically wired could have been unaware of the dirty dealing all around him. On his watch, the prosecutor's office has been overstocked with part-time politicians and others tied to Mason's political network and, in some cases, with his own relatives. It has developed a reputation among judges and defense attorneys for overcharging defendants and refusing to strike deals that would allow the justice system to focus on the most serious offenders.

Jimenez fired a fastball off Tulowitzki's elbow on the first pitch of his first at-bat Sunday. Jimenez said it was unintentional, though Major League Baseball is investigating the incident, leaving a suspension possible for the Cleveland right-hander.
The movie takes five minutes to establish that Marley (Hudson) is a happy idiot, then introduces the fact that she is losing weight and has rectal bleeding. When she goes to the doctor, he touches her abdomen, and she doubles over. Yet she's still cracking jokes, even during the colonoscopy. And when the procedure is over and the doctor says, "We're going to be doing some biopsies," she doesn't say, "Biopsies? Of what? How big was it? What do you think?" She just nods and goes on her merry way.

Top June draft pick Larry Greene went through the FIL without an at-bat. He tweaked a groin muscle early and was kept out of running situations. Which raises the yearly problem of late-signing draftees going through a summer without the organized conditioning work a kid needs to play at the pro level. They quickly find out this isn't Legion ball anymore . . . Charles O. Finley had a practical idea for keeping down free-agent salaries. The A's maverick owner suggested signing players for a year only, then making them all free agents. "The Yankees can only sign the best 25," he would say. "Then the rest of us can split the rest." With the epidemic of D-I football conference-jumping and reorganizing, how about just making all the D-I teams yearly independents? Everybody just schedule who they want each year. Sure beats putting the University of Hawaii in the Big East.

Johnson isn't sure how the outfield will look in Werth's absence. Roger Bernadina started in left field on Tuesday, though it's possible Xavier Nady will also see more time.
There's still time for the NFL to admit that taking the kickoff return out of the game is a terrible idea. Knowing how league decisions go these days, I'm sure Roger Goodell will bring that motion to the attention of Roger Goodell before announcing the unanimous decision to forge ahead with an unnecessary rule change...

So I'm going to take my time and think about it and my parents and I will make a decision and we're going to go up there and have a look at everything. I haven't visited Michigan State yet and there are only certain things that I know about Michigan State until I go up there but, to be honest, if I go up there and it's an absolutely awesome place then I don't see anything changing," he said.
"There's a lot of season left," Roy said. "So I don't want to just say cut out of the whole year. Because there are a lot of games to be played. I'm hopeful that I'll feel much better after this week and seeing some improvement will be encouraging to me."
Councilwoman Kathleen Anderson said enforcement would be a burden on the recycling coordinator, who is a volunteer.
This is one of those times when we're hit with the jarring truth of our similarities. We aren't nearly as different from one another as we sometimes like to think.

Pastry chef Matt Danko's Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Steam Bun ($3.50) reminded me of the "sandwich" you make by spreading Wonder Bread with peanut butter, folding it over and jamming it into your mouth. He serves it with an ounce of milk. I preferred a tooth-numbing pot de cr me that came with homemade caramel topping so thick and delicious I can't recall the pudding below ($3.50).

A: You think about it, when I started, in the early '80s, the dining room in the old ballpark was divided into two. A room on one side, the kitchen in the middle, then the other room. The side with the bar didn't allow women. So we've come light years. ...

Everyone accepts that. It's a fair observation. These are all tough games. But nobody looking at the top of the polls wants to hear about labor pains -- college football is a show-me-the-baby business.

The novel, as a storytelling device, begins with that white parchment of possibility, turns many tricks, reveals many truths and, in the best of hands, can exploit the very worst in humankind. Novels are fairly seditious undertakings. And that's why the very idea of a Zen novel sounds like either a comedy sketch or simply an improbable stretch.
Under Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, a firm defender of the austerity policies championed by Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, Spain is implementing cuts across all levels of government and has reversed course on a 30-year process of power devolution to regions.

Pointing to the Bulls' 45.2 percent shooting and 92 points, Thibodeau insisted offense isn't the main issue anyway.
The pipe, known as Line 300B, failed because of a tear in a longitudinal seam - the same type of failure that caused the Sept. 9, 2010, explosion of a transmission pipeline in San Bruno that killed eight people, destroyed 38 homes and damaged 70 more.

“The whole purpose of the franchise fees increase was to provide support for the schools for one year,” said Tierney. “But if we can find that support through another measure that is more within our control in the operation budget and gets to the same end goal, I think it’s viable and that we should reconsider.”
At a court hearing a month later, Rachna appeared in a black burka, surrounded by about 100 of Talani's supporters, many of them armed, said the girl's uncle, Rakesh Kumar.

Chrysler’s sales rose 20 percent from a year earlier as sales of its midsize Chrysler 200 and Dodge Avenger soared, along with the full-size Chrysler 300. Toyota’s rebound from last year’s earthquake and tsunami continued to gain traction. By contrast, Ford and General Motors both lost market share from a year earlier, partly because they are selling fewer cars to rental companies and corporate fleets.
Jason Arnott scored a power-play goal with 9:54 to to in the second period to give the Blues a 3-1 lead in Game 3 of their series with San Jose.
* It's great to see reliever Mitchell Boggs thriving in a late-inning role. He's obviously a talented guy. His confidence is a plus now, which wasn't the case under the previous regime. Early stats can be misleading, but Boggs has a good formula going: nine strikeouts and no walks; a rate of four baserunners per nine innings, two double-play grounders so far; an opponents' batting average of .138. Boggs' slider has been a killer. He's thrown 27 sliders so far, without allowing a hit. He's also getting a swing-miss rate of 50 percent on the slider.

Advocates for this project argue that it will generate much-needed clean energy and that to oppose it on environmental grounds is hypocritical. That is shortsighted. The need to develop domestic sources of clean energy is clear. It is also clear that there are numerous other places throughout Oregon and the United States that are more appropriate for such development. Not all renewable-energy projects are created equal: Responsible development focuses on building near existing infrastructure and avoiding sensitive areas.
In 1905 Isom drafted a bill authorizing the a State Library Commission, patterned after a similar body in Wisconsin.

That's very unlikely."
The smarter ones arrived around noon to snag a prime seat on the lawn or to be front and center in the pit for the next eleven hours. The first band of the day, alterna-rock group Fun., kicked it off energetically, even if those in attendance were divided between devoted fans and those who knew only “We Are Young.” Their act was certainly more lively than A$AP Rocky’s; at least they were onstage for more than three back-tracked songs, which is more than I can say for the New York rapper.

By most accounts, Louisville's renaissance started in 2004 with Fourth Street Live!, a collection of neon and chain restaurants aimed at convention traffic that is as subtle as the exclamation mark might make you suspect. The next major landmark was the 2010 opening of a downtown arena for the University of Louisville basketball team (runner-up to Catholicism for the city's most popular religion). It also gave performers such as Lady Gaga a reason to add Louisville to their tours.
Sam's grandfather died of cancer, and in 2009 Sam and several family members walked San Clemente's American Cancer Society Relay for Life. He noticed that no one was collecting water bottles at the event for recycling, so he and his family did, donating $55 in proceeds to the Relay for Life fund.

At least one person was killed during sporadic clashes over the past few days.
The Orange Crush teams of the late 1970s established the Broncos as the biggest sports story in town, a perch the franchise has held ever since, despite the arrival of major- league hockey and baseball. Good season or bad, the Broncos sell out, and develop new fan favorites, such as the Three Amigos in the 1980s.
The road rocketeer lived to talk about it (complete with the above YouTube video) and to market his creation as the Super Twin. Now, he's selling the bicycles, with their engines and polished-metal casing reminiscent of a 1950's sci-fi movie, on eBay for $8,500 a pop.

Thomas interpreted the state's 2005 human smuggling law to charge the people smuggled as conspirators; no other Arizona county attorneys have done so.

The big difference this time is because of the processors' smaller size, the capability of the graphics is significantly better."
Some of the offerings were brilliant; others fell into the "Really?" category. Like the arm warmers made of chunks of sweater sleeves that had been cut up and reassembled in interesting patterns, with a hole for the thumbs.

If there is an answer, Bogdanovic suggests it could be something as simple as class size. There are only about 100 seniors. “If we had 400 people,” she said, “maybe there would be more cliques. But since we are such a small school, we sort of have to get along.”

Roster surprises - Outfielders Erik Komatsu and Robinson made the club after injuries took down Schumaker and Craig. The club selected Komatsu from the Nationals in the major league draft in December. Komatsu, 24, hasn't played above Double-A but impressed the major league staff with a line-drive bat and strong fundamental game, including base-stealing ability. Robinson, 27, appeared in St. Louis in 2009 and 2011. His ability to play center field is critical given Schumaker's absence.

Then when I read in USA Today that Corbo’s had been named one of the best bakeries in the country, I thought ‘I should just call these guys up.’”
It speaks to what Mourinho does best, possibly better than any other manager in the game: Getting his players to buy into what he's trying to do. Poll players who have played for him—on and off the record—and, with two or three exceptions, you won't find any who criticize him, even among those who didn't get much playing time or whom he shipped out. For any boss to have such a high popularity rating among former employees after a decade is simply extraordinary and probably unmatched.
One of Hohaus' favorite dishes is a classic: oysters Rockefeller. Invented by Jules Alciatore, the second-generation proprietor of Antoine's in New Orleans in the early 1800s, the original dish was created with green herbs and lots of butter. It was rich, like John D. Rockefeller himself.

The earliest tunnels are thought to date to the fourth century, but they left their mark on history in 1831, when silk weavers, known as canuts, revolted over declining salaries. During a guided tour of the Maison des Canuts, which included a weaving demonstration on a 19th-century Jacquard loom, I learned that the canuts used the traboules to get around the city during the revolt. Thanks to these passageways, the silk workers managed to take control of the city and the official rates for textile production, until Paris got wind of the revolution (and the 600 deaths) and squelched the canuts.
This, after all, being Hollywood, if SBE's Sam Nazarian is going to name a restaurant for the queen of Egypt, it's obligatory to vamp it up a little. Set in the crimson Redbury Hotel, a stone's throw from Hollywood and Vine, Cleo references the alluring Egyptian with a giant, black-and-white photo of the silent film actress Theda Bara as a fierce, dark-eyed Cleopatra from 1917. More queens of the cinema grace the walls of the high-ceilinged room, but their Cleos look decidedly tame compared with Bara.

But seriously. Most of us celebrate Easter for a day and then we're over it. We go back to whatever our normal is, as if the unbelievable event hadn't taken place. And the event is not the holiday, which will naturally come and go. I'm talking about the actual Resurrection. I truly believe that it took place, you know. For reals, as the young folks say these days. And that Resurrection was for all time. When Jesus came out of the tomb something was done that would never be undone, something was rewired in the universe and we live on the other side of that event. On the Christian calendar the 50 days that begin at Easter are called Eastertide. But really, don't those who follow Christ live all of

Ohio presently gets its steelhead trout eggs from Michigan, trading channel catfish for a pure strain of Little Manistee River trout that have proven their worth in Ohio. The trout are much wilder than the home-grown rainbow trout Ohio once raised at its London Fish Hatchery and converted into steelhead trout. As a result, the Little Manistee River trout are far more likely to race to Lake Erie after being released, grow big and strong, and return to the waters where they were released.

Hey, Gary: The gap between what the Browns think Hillis is worth and what Hillis thinks he is worth is as wide as ever. Remember that it takes two sides to make a deal. I believe he will leave in free agency. I don't think the Browns will draft Richardson unless he is still on the board at No. 22. Griffin at No. 4? I think there's a 50-50 chance he could be there for the Browns. I don't think anyone knows at this point if they would take him.

Frank Sinatra: I was 10 years younger than Frank Sinatra and was one of the original bobby-soxers when he was hitting it so big at the Paramount Theater. He was very much like a mentor and then a brother to me in later years. I remember early in my career I had a dilemma as I was getting my first TV special — it was a summer replacement show for "The Perry Como Show" — and they had no budget so I just had a bare stage and nothing else. I was so worried about how it would turn out.... [Sinatra] gave me the best advice that to this day I have never forgotten: He said it was good that I was nervous because it showed that I cared, and that the audience would sense this and as a result they would root for me, as they would know that I was concerned that they would be entertained and enjoy themselves. To this day, I still get butterflies before I go out onstage, and I remember Frank's words and know that it's when the butterflies don't happen anymore that you really have to be worried.

Green Bay won the 1997 Super Bowl against New England because Villa Angela St. Joseph's Desmond Howard, the game's Most Valuable Player, was a wraith all night on kick returns.

Smith is a Brooklyn native who played at St. Michael Academy and McKenith a Newark native who played at University (N.J.). Also in that class was former North Babylon star Eugeneia McPherson, another starter on this year’s Sweet 16 team.
I couldn't help but notice that Gary Coe, a candidate for Senate District 14, neglected to include his ownership of Retriever Towing as part of his biography on his campaign website (http://www.coe4senate.com/). An accidental oversight on his part? Maybe. However, I find it more likely that it's because Retriever Towing is known for its predatory towing practices throughout the Portland Metro area.
Frank Woodruff Buckles was born Feb. 1, 1901, on a farm near Bethany, Mo. He was living in Oakwood, Okla., when the United States entered World War I, and he tried to enlist in the Marine Corps at age 16, having been inspired by recruiting posters.

A New York steakhouse gets a world-class drubbing: While we're on the subject of food criticism, restaurant reviews don't get any more acidic that Bloomberg writer Ryan Sutton's dandy take-down of Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse in New York. This steakhouse, where two people can easily spend $400 on dinner, has almost nothing to recommend about it, unless you're fond of greasy $65 ribeyes with the mouthfeel of a sponge, or $100 lobster tails that taste like carpet. Choice quote: "Portions are Texas-size, perhaps bigger than at any other city meatery. But I may as well be at Outback."
Q: Hey, Tony: It's no secret that the Browns are lacking a little depth in some key positions. Do you see them filling their needs with cuts from other ballclubs, or are there any free agents they may try to low-ball once they start to panic for work? What do you think of Tiki Barber filling Brandon Jackson's role? -- Bryan Van Dine, Belpre, Ohio
All we got to say on this proposition is this: first, me and you is as good as anybody else, and maybe a damn sight better; second, nobody ain't got no right to take away none of our rights; third, every man has got a right to live, to come and go as he pleases, and to have a good time whichever way he likes, so long as he don't interfere with nobody else. That any government that don't give a man them rights ain't worth a damn; also, people ought to choose the kind of government they want themselves, and nobody else ought to have no say in the matter. That whenever any government don't do this, then the people have got a right to give it the bum's rush and put in one that will take care of their interests. Of course, that don't mean having a revolution every day like them South American yellowbellies, or every time some jobholder goes to work and does something he ain't got no business to do. It is better to stand a little graft, etc., than to have revolutions all the time, ..., and any man that wasn't a anarchist or one of them I.W.W.'s would say the same. But when things get so bad that a man ain't hardly got no rights at all no more, but you might almost call him a slave, then everybody ought to get together and throw the grafters out, and put in new ones who won't carry on so high and steal so much, and then watch them. This is the proposition the people of these Colonies is up against, and they have got tired of it, and won't stand it no more. The administration of the present King, George III, has been rotten from the start, and when anybody kicked about it he always tried to get away with it by strong-arm work. Here is some of the rough stuff he has pulled:

Last year’s homicide total in Newark — the most statewide — was down from five years ago, when 86 people were killed in Brick City. It also belied the city’s drop in overall crime for 2009, with nearly 5,000 fewer incidents reported than in 2004. There have been 72 killings in the city so far this year.

But the Bears hopes are built around one player - quarterback Jay Cutler - and Cutler was sacked 105 times in the last two seasons, and that is not healthy. That is not good at all.

The power of chocolate is undeniable. When we leave the Hotel Sacher, our bags are slightly heavier because I've grabbed all the chocolate toiletries that remain in our room and the leftover candy from our first day. Not that they were necessary. Our parting gift? Two tiny Sacher tortes, reminders that chocolate — and caffeine — make the world go round.

He shouted in pain. As the caber fell back again he looked down to find his fingers running parallel with the back of his hand. The impact had nearly ripped his fingers off; they dangled like loose pipe wire.
Sure, but none of that detracts from the essence of "Titanic," which is to plunge viewers into a bygone world, the better for them to witness its destruction first-hand. And when that end comes, the audience doesn't just see it but feel it, whether in the sight of an elderly couple embracing as frigid water eddies around their bed or that valiant orchestra playing "Nearer My God to Thee," or in the horror reflected in the eyes of Kathy Bates' unsinkable Molly Brown as she beholds the slow, fatal descent from one of the "Titanic's" too-few lifeboats.
When was the last time you gave your kids a small bowl of sugar for breakfast? Or yourself? Probably today, if you had a cup of Honey Smacks, Golden Crisps, Cap'n Crunch or even healthy-sounding Quaker Oats Oh's. All have 3 to 5 teaspoons of sugar per cup.

A stroke, often referred to as a "brain attack," is a serious medical condition that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is either interrupted due to blockage of a blood vessel and part of the brain dies, or a blood vessel ruptures causing bleeding into or around the brain. Patients experiencing a brain attack can be affected in a number of ways, including paralysis, loss of speech, loss of vision, loss of memory, and even death. About 80 percent of all strokes are caused by blockage of blood flow to the brain by a combination of plaque (fatty deposits and calcium) and blood clots.
A new seafood jambalaya dish as part of a different promotion also did not live up to expectations. It was "not a compelling enough feature to generate the special visit interest we expected and may have been further hampered by concerns related to the Gulf oil spill," Madsen said.
"It's too soon to tell. We're definitely going to revisit this in late April," said CDOT spokeswoman Nancy Shanks.
So two people from different worlds descend upon a wounded, confused London with the same goal: to find their children. Their paths cross, not just once but several times: at a class where Arabic is taught, at a morgue where survivors identify bodies, at a market. Elisabeth, to whom worrying seems to come more naturally, at first wants nothing to do with the gentle, dreadlocked Ousmane, even though he may have some clues about the recent past of both children.
Win Mra, who heads a government-appointed National Human Rights Commission appointed last year, said he has made some attempt to get remaining prisoners on the agenda, but acknowledged it's not a government priority.

Corzine's $29.8 billion budget proposal allocates another $150 million to the fund, about $120 million less than he said he would put into the fund in February.

But the board had exonerated Brigham in 1996 on similar charges involving his clinics in New Jersey and New York. It decided the surgical removal of the fetus constitutes an abortion, not Brigham’s use of a cervix-dilating device in his New Jersey offices in the hours or days before the surgery.
Most of the tall buildings are on Hong Kong Island side, so as the ferry pulled away from the pier, I looked back for my first view of the skyline. It was dark by then, and the illuminated skyscrapers danced magically above the water.
Just as with the impoundment proposal, critics will argue that granting driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants condones their presence in this country and makes it easier for them to stay. That makes sense in theory but not in practice. The reality is that undocumented immigrants are already here, and they are already driving to jobs taking care of children, mowing lawns and working in factories, among other things. Doesn't it make sense to ensure that every driver, regardless of immigration status, is trained, capable and insured?
Pinkett asked whether blacks have achieved "full inclusion or is it an illusion?" He offered that inclusion is closer to reality for only some.
Sheep, geese and dead game, rendered in Westergren's skillful hand, evoke Old Master still lifes, photorealism, and, with their flat backgrounds, Pop art. The lambs in particular give the lie to idealized notions of fertility and rebirth, with umbilical cords dangling and hindquarters splattered with excrement. Yet these powerfully ambivalent images are interrupted by a celebratory image of a goose in flight over a background inexplicably coated with shiny car paint, and a painted detail from the medieval “Unicorn Tapestries” depicting a unicorn goring a dog.
I can do without all the adoring crowd shots. But wow, what a masterful bit of singing this is.

Aside from the noodles, which may also come with chicken, squid or shrimp, the next-best things at Du Kuh Bee ("lucky" in Korean) are the barbecued dishes. The beef ribs are nothing like what we Americans are used to. Instead of long, curved bones, these are thin, flat pieces of meat, smoked over a charcoal grill without sauce and then smothered in grilled onions. Eel receives the same treatment; satin-smooth morsels, they fall apart in your mouth and fill it with a charred sweetness.
The deaths of Jasso and Gonzales make two dozen people who have drowned on Missouri's waterways this year.
"The main thing is that for every $1 that the state spends on the tax credit, $1.20 is returned to the state," said Candi Clouse, who prepared the study for the Center for Economic Development at Cleveland State University's Levin College of Urban Affairs. "That's 20 cents above the investment that's being returned into the economy in jobs in the film industry and ancillary jobs that support the film industry."
"It was a big game for the whole team," Cutler said.

The long series of debates among the Republican candidates has been one of the most unexpectedly influential factors in the current campaign. If not for the debates, Gingrich -- who is so good at them – would be back to spouting his big thoughts on Fox. Rick Perry -- who is embarrassingly bad at them -- would be one of the final four candidates instead of the latest to drop out.
It hasn't been so much fun for his opponents. The senior became only the fifth wrestler ever to win four Maryland Public Secondary School Athletic Association state titles over a career.
