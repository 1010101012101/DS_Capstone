Anyone seeking deeper understanding of the Arab Spring needs to read Wright's formidably well-informed book. A former correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, Wright has covered much of the Muslim worldthatfor four decades. She sees the political revolts in the Middle East and North Africa as part of a broader trend: "the counter-jihad, which is unfolding in the wider Islamic bloc of fifty-seven countries as well as among Muslim minorities worldwide." Muslim citizens are not only overthrowing autocratic regimes, she believes; they are also rejecting the violent extremism of Al Qaeda and the Taliban and the fundamentalist Islamic ideology that fuels terrorism and guides theocracies such as Iran.

"But when I think of old, antiquated -- some would say outdated, some would say charming -- Fenway, two images immediately come to mind, the smell in the tunnel going from the visiting clubhouse to the third-base dugout and the adrenaline rush I get when the windows to the press box are all flung open just before the first pitch on a warm New England evening.
The end came more quickly for Mr. Santorum's campaign than had been expected. The next set of primaries include his home state, and his success or failure there was likely to determine whether he would have the support, financial and otherwise, to continue. Mindful of that, Mr. Romney and the super PAC supporting him have poured millions into the state. Meanwhile, Mr. Santorum was caring for his youngest daughter, Bella, who was born with a chromosomal disorder and had recently been hospitalized with pneumonia. It is unclear whether that played into his decision to suspend his campaign — it would certainly be understandable if it did — but the truth is that his lead in Pennsylvania had all but evaporated, and a defeat or even a close finish there would have intensified the pressure for him to drop out.

There's a quick trip to Goldeneye, the Duckhorn Wine Co.'s tasting room in Philo, which some locals view with an upraised brow as "more Napa-like." It's elegant, with glossy wood floors, cushy leather club chairs and a long dining table that looks out onto a fairy-tale garden. Nat "King" Cole tunes infuse the backspace as we taste two exclusive Pinots—the 2004 Goldeneye and the 2005 Migration—just weeks before their release to the public.

Yes, it does. Mr. Romney constantly talks about job losses under Mr. Obama. Yet all of the net job loss took place in the first few months of 2009, that is, before any of the new administration’s policies had time to take effect. So the Ohio speech was a perfect illustration of the way the Romney campaign is banking on amnesia, on the hope that voters don’t remember that Mr. Obama inherited an economy that was already in free fall.

Before anyone jumps on me as an anti-fast food elitist – wrong.

He's also funny at rest, hanging upside-down bat-style here and there around the house. Luckily, this is enough to keep us amused.

A few facts in The Watchdog story need to be clarified ("Let board members in, attorney says," Oct. 18). First, CEO Larry Anderson did not seek to increase his salary as implied in this story. Under Anderson's employment contract, the district is obligated to review his salary annually.

The board's previous compensation consultant no longer works for the board. Such consultants report directly to the board and not to Anderson.

You didn't mention if your mom and brother owed past rent, because the landlord might be charging them for rent owed. If the $23,000 bill doesn't cover past rent and instead reimburses the owner for a new kitchen floor and remodeling, your mom and brother are most likely not responsible. After 11 years of living in the same unit, there will be a reasonable amount of wear and tear on a floor. Tenants are not held responsible for replacing the flooring unless they damaged or destroyed it.
But by the end of the play, talking hardly matters. What matters is having someone to embrace, to lean against, to catch you if you fall. They're the most natural group you could find: just people, turning to each other because they're there to turn to. It's a blessing.

Walgreen Co. broke off talks Express Scripts on June 21, saying Express Scripts, based in north St. Louis County, had offered a 3-year contract that would have cut reimbursement rates to below the industry's average cost to fill prescriptions. Express Scripts - which manages prescription benefits for large employers, insurers and the Defense Department - says Walgreens has proposed dispensing rates that would eventually put the drug chain at about 20 percent above the rate paid to other contracted pharmacies.
The new contract allows the more than 200,000 Oregonians who use ReliaCards each month to have free and unlimited withdrawals from U.S. Bank ATMs and bank branch teller windows.

Lance Berkman provided $22.4 million in production to the Cardinals, based on the site's view of what the market should/would pay for his contributions.

Kudos to Judge Benson E. Legg for overturning Maryland's draconian and unconstitutional gun-carry laws. Statistics are very clear — granting carry permits to law-abiding, well-trained citizens does not increase gun violence. In fact, when the good are armed, the bad are hesitant. When I lived in Pennsylvania, I had a weapons permit, carried the gun often and never once fired it anywhere except the shooting range. But I was prepared to protect myself and my family, if necessary.

The reams of data the new-age statisticians are now compiling ad nauseam for NBA teams - the Cavaliers being one of the dozen or so dedicated enough to employ analysts - can be much the same.

We weren't fooled. We weren't lied to. None of us. Not a one. Just all left wondering what happened, who played the parts, and how it is that Kelly went from gone to back again.

A: Yes, yes, New India. Because of my husband, and the world we live in, I knew better than most people how ridiculous my project sounded to anyone else. What a cliché I am!

As a Cardinal described to me the other day in the clubhouse, this stat does have some application problems with the local nine. They move around a lot. They shift. They slide. Furcal's catch in shallow center on Wednesday night is worth a plus, but that plus does not take into account that he was also shifted over to the bag. Similarly, Skip Schumaker will probably never be a plus fielder to his left at second base because Albert Pujols cuts off a lot of those grounders in his attempt to, as Chris Duncan likes to kid on WXOS/101.1 FM radio, win Gold Gloves at two positions.
of the San Jose Sharks down the middle has been the envy of the NHL. The big bodies of Joe Thornton (6-foot-4, 230 pounds) and Patrick Marleau (6-2, 220) presented most opponents with mismatches, which became a key to the Sharks' success.

Debbie Burks, Yorba Linda: "Regarding the topic of Rush Limbaugh, John & Ken, and KFI you wrote: 'Stimulating is not the word I believe it would use to describe recent 'angry or controversial' episodes.' Au contraire. The comments and controversy "stimulated" you to write a column on the subject. My concern is the First Amendment and the move to restrict free speech on the airwaves. Every radio comes equipped with an off switch. Long ago, I turned off John & Ken. They often made outrageous claims and most times without facts. But I never lobbied to silence them.

This romantic drama is the edgiest-ever film adaptation of the writings of Nicholas Sparks -- which isn't saying much. Beth (Taylor Schilling) is a willowy and gorgeous single mom running a kennel with her speaks-her-mind grandma (Blythe Danner). Logan (Zac Efron) is a brooding but chivalrous ex-soldier who tracks her down after finding a photo of her on a battlefield in Iraq. He charms her, but she's slow to warm to him even as she's ogling the backside of his work jeans. Director Scott Hicks lifts this material above previous Sparks-inspired movies ("Dear John," "The Last Song") by holding his revelations in reserve and producing a scene or two of real sexual heat. But Sparks telegraphs his story's every move and underlines every emotion. Rated PG-13; sexuality, violence. 1 hour, 41 minutes. By Roger Moore.

The Plain Dealer surveyed a handful of cities and school districts to determine how much they spent last year on personnel costs that could be cut under SB 5.

* I like the hire of Gregg Williams as Rams defensive coordinator. The one-time coach of the Class 5 Belton (Mo.) High School football Pirates, Williams is one of the more acclaimed DCs of his era. His New Orleans Saints defense collapsed at the end of Saturday's NFC divisional game, twice failing to stop the San Francisco 49ers to preserve the lead. But it would be extremely stupid to assess the hiring based on five bad minutes in a playoff game.

Second, the U.S. credit crisis has made it harder for the Big Three to arrange car loans for their customers and to obtain credit to fund their own operations.

The Rigginses call the rolls a “party in your mouth.” Dough is filled with special seasonings, sausages, greens and corn, then coated with Ed’s special coating and deep-fried until golden.

"Certain times of year are tougher than others," Levis said. "I have a great team of guys back at the store. This is good for the store, and I'm young yet, so I'm going to play as long as I can.

It's something I'm very passionate about and something my family has sacrificed for my entire life, and I'm very appreciative."
In a world in which Thai menus are everywhere but nearly identical in their color-coded curries and formulaic stir-fries, Pok Pok shows the heart and depth of a cuisine in which no two dishes are alike. Every offering has its own mission statement, down to the spicy fruit salad best dispatched with a shot of whiskey. One dish will be all about its heady herbal potion; another is detonated by massive heat bombs; others are rooted in the power of aromas or even the magic of sweet, sour, fire and crunch.

øQuickie: R-Spec seems too firm to be lux, too soft to be sporting. Specifically, the steering is heavy, the ride nearly harsh. And the suspension has a sloppy feel in quick maneuvers. It's confused, and not a good representation of either the silk-stocking or lead-foot intentions of the brand.
