Mychal Tetteh said people often jump to develop solutions before they have clearly understood the problems. North Williams Avenue’s problems, he said, all stem from interactions between people. "You can’t engineer solutions to them with stripes on the road. We need to move to a place where people can interact with each other in a way that’s predictable and safe.”

"Being a Texas kid ... I've seen the Redskins over the years, I've seen the many quarterbacks that they've gone through. I'm glad that the organization and the coaching staff bought into drafting a younger quarterback, trying to make him their franchise quarterback and growing with him," said Griffin, who threw 78 touchdown passes and just 17 interceptions in his 41 college games while finishing as Baylor's fifth-leading career rusher and with the second-most efficient season as a senior of any quarterback in NCAA history.
Tanking becomes a hot topic at this time of the season, especially around teams that are clearly out of the playoff picture. Fans of the Warriors, for example, have become focused on getting a good pick, and the team seems to be going along, losing five in a row and 10 of its last 12. Point guard Stephen Curry hasn't played since March 11, and many fans don't seem to mind.

Pat Shurmur, on what Weeden brings to the team: "We think he is going to project into being an outstanding NFL quarterback. We were able to see that in the way that he competed in college. As the coach sitting here, if every move we make we can say we are getting better, that is what you have to do. We felt like having him on our team, he was going to make us better and he was going to make the position better. That is why we picked him."
"It really (ticks) me off," Trevor said. "He tries to throw it slow and he still throws it harder than I threw a fastball."

In some public records, he gave a Berea address. He was arrested in Berea in 2010 for underage drinking. In Cleveland, he was ordered to perform community service last year for disorderly conduct. He failed to complete the service and a warrant was issued for his arrest.
The gamble paid off, and the Fishers are now full-time innkeepers. The bed and breakfast has since been recognized as one of the best in the Midwest. Fisher said it is often booked up months in advance.
Actually, the most difficult part of planning this event has been limiting the number of roasters. It isn't every day that a media type gives those he or she covers carte blanche to say cruelly funny things about him in front of an audience. So, they're coming out of the woodwork to be a part of this thing, and I guess I'm not surprised.
The Rockies are tired of talking about getting old. They see their gray as a sign of maturity, and experience. But with age comes compromise.

Jay was riding a six-game hitting streak when he slammed into the wall in pursuit of Cincinnati Reds' outfielder Drew Stubbs' home run Thursday. Jay compared the sensation to a 'stinger," which causes temporary numbness. By Friday, he said full sensation had returned to his arm and shoulder.
We know the defense could be good. They also appear to be nasty. It may not have been a coincidence that a lot of bumps and bruises were on the offensive side of the ball in camp. One incident highlighted the intensity this summer. In the second scrimmage last weekend Joe Lefeged scooped up a fumble and went on to score. During the runback safety Khaseem Greene laid a hit on an unsuspecting Tom Savage, who was in the neighborhood but not actively trying to make the tackle (it is preseason after all). The hit prompted Savage’s primary protectors - tackles Wynn and Stapleton to go after Greene and a mini-brawl ensued. No coach likes to see his players fight (unless you are Rex Ryan of course), but you sure have to like both the nastiness of the defense and the spunkiness of the offense to defend their leader. We will see how this transforms to the field.

After the victory over Michigan this year and Georgetown two years ago, perhaps the prospect of facing a legendary program has become less intimidating.

"You still have to score because the Europeans can score on people," he said. "I use this analogy with my team all the time. When the men played in Beijing [in 2008] and played Spain in the gold-medal game, you've got a team with LeBron [James], Kobe [Bryant], Dwyane Wade and Chris Paul. Spain scored 107 points in 40 minutes in that game. That just scares you because the Europeans know how to score. There just come times you have to outscore the other team.

Washington took a 2-0 lead in the second period on goals by Alexander Semin at 11:16 and Jay Beagle at 14:27. About 15 seconds before Semin's goal, Bruins defenseman Joe Corvo blocked a shot and fell to the ice. He struggled to his skates and didn't regain his normal stride before Semin scored. Julien said play should have been stopped. He also was upset when Zdeno Chara was dazed after taking an elbow to the head without a penalty being called.
No. 4 Wisconsin (25-9) vs. No. 5 Vanderbilt (25-10), 3 p.m., TNT: Wisconsin plays excellent perimeter defense, and shutting down Vandy on the perimeter is the key to beating the Commodores. Vanderbilt guard John Jenkins might be the best pure shooter in the nation, and guard Brad Tinsley and forward Jeffrey Taylor also can get hot from beyond the arc. Vandy's toughness has been questioned at times, and that could be an issue against the tough-minded Badgers. Wisconsin isn't overly athletic; the higher the point total, the better for the Commodores.

Caro is properly enthralled by Johnson putting the power of the presidency behind a discharge petition that, by advancing, compelled a Southern committee chairman to allow what became the 1964 Civil Rights Act to get to the Senate, where Johnson's meticulous cultivation of another Southern chairman prevented tax cut legislation from becoming hostage to the civil rights filibuster. By taking such arcana seriously, and celebrating Johnson's virtuosity regarding them, Caro honors the seriousness of his readers, who should reciprocate the compliment.

And the kids are making good progress. Evans, now playing almost exclusively at the 3 spot, has been among the league leaders in rebounding, and Jett has developed into one of SLU's top defenders. McCall has seen his role change from point guard to off guard and is handling the transition. Loe was among the A-10 leaders in 3-point shooting at the start of the season, though the New Zealander's numbers have come down with the start of league play as he seems to be taking a little longer to make the adjustment to American basketball. "We've seen growth (with Loe), but it's incremental," Majerus said. "It's slight, but at least it's growth. Rob needed someone to give him shots. Unfortunately, our smalls are more score-oriented. Rob is still adjusting to the pace of the game." Today's game against Duquesne, which plays four or five guards at once, is an especially tough matchup for Loe and will probably limit his minutes.

By a 25-7 vote, Senate Republicans joined by a pair of Democrats approved the congressional lines that whittle Ohio's 18 districts into 16 newly configured seats. An amendment added in committee by GOP forces fixes the spring 2012 primary on the first Tuesday in March and serves up $2.75 million for county boards of elections to implement the new lines.

The statewide exam system works well but still has some challenges, said Jordan, also general counsel for the advocacy group Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault, or MCASA. For example, not all hospitals offer the exams. Nurses typically only visit another hospital when a victim is too injured to move, and some hospitals resist exams for victims who haven't involved police, she said. More victims' advocates are needed as well, Jordan said, to ensure that someone beyond the nurse, with medical duties, is available to answer questions, direct to services and even hand-hold.

After some trouble between cranky Peruvian trainer Turo Escalante and heart-of-gold veterinarian Jo Carter and a sweet scene between Ace Bernstein (Hoffman) and his parole officer, an improbable, slickly edited earthquake hits. Everyone reacts according to their nature -- Lonnie (Hart) stands between tables at the diner and screams “earthquake!” -- and the tremor knock the trajectory off the bullet that Joey was about to put into his brain. The bullet pings around and grazes his cheek, and next thing we know he’s in the ER, assuring a skeptical doctor that “what matters is the event in it's entirety. I sensed the event as a positive thing, Doc, I can tell you that for a fact.” When the doctor leaves, Joey starts repeating his name and reads the label on his shirt, assuring himself that whatever he had is still there.

Fringe Democrats have had their share of conspiracy theories – including one, for example, that fingered Dick Cheney as being behind the World Trade Center attack. But a concurrence of circumstances has recently fanned allegations from the other end of the political spectrum. The Tea Party's role as a clearinghouse for anti-government sentiment has attracted conspiracy theorists, for instance, while the country's ongoing economic struggle has fueled the public's desire for scapegoats. The growth of minorities in government and governmental assistance for minorities may also play a role.
Still battling. It was a pleasure to see an old friend, Eduardo Najera, in Denver's game Friday at Charlotte. Najera attacked the basket and drew charges the way he did at the Pepsi Center for the Nuggets. The 36-year-old Bobcats forward has battled injuries this season, and Charlotte coaches have gone with younger players. But Najera grabbed eight rebounds Wednesday against Minnesota and he had six points and three steals Friday against Denver. That prompted coach Paul Silas to say, "If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't be in any games right now."

We rely on the fact that the large majority of our passengers (about two-thirds) purchase some sort of travel coverage to protect their vacation in the event of the unexpected."
Still, isolated crimes targeting students off campus have made headlines and unnerved some students. In 2008, a 19-year-old star sprinter was shot and wounded while walking at night near campus. The same year, a film student was fatally stabbed in a fight after he slammed an apartment complex gate near the university. Last year, two USC students were shot and wounded when several students confronted a stranger who appeared to be stealing items during a party at a nearby apartment complex.

Past experience with federal loan guarantees suggests that any rescue package for the Big Three should require them to take major cost-cutting measures and devise a business plan that promises to make them profitable within a specified period; say, the next four years. Moreover, in exchange for the guarantees, the firms should be required to give stock warrants to the U.S. Treasury so taxpayers can benefit from future stock appreciation if the companies eventually become profitable.

Taken together, the fallout from the financial crisis has changed the banking landscape. In short, the sins of the past will haunt big banks longer than in the past.

Fey has a great sense of pace and timing — longer, weightier chapters dealing with her profession and her career are balanced with short pieces on being fat and being thin and some responses to evil email — and a love of language that echoes early Nora Ephron and, before that, the marvelous Jean Kerr. In her own way, Fey has been doing this all her life. She is a physical personal essayist in that her writing and performing all stem from what she thinks about the experiences she has had. The seams that hold "Bossypants" together are her experiences specifically as a woman; although she is far from heavy-handed, Fey is matter-of-fact about the double standard to which women are still held. That some found her impersonation of Palin "ungracious" is, to her mind, the perfect example: Palin, she argues, is not fragile and she, Fey, is not mean.

This may seem obvious, right? But not all bookcase displays need to include books. And not all displays need to treat books the same way. One approach is to make your books the main attraction.

The story starts in Bombay, where Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen), the Danish director of an impoverished orphanage, learns of a providential donation from an industrialist in Denmark. The only catch is that Jacob must fly home to meet the benefactor, Jorgen, face to face. (Jorgen is played brilliantly by Rolf Lassgard.) Once the two men have met, the host invites his guest to his daughter's wedding, and Jacob's past suddenly becomes his shocking present.
Huge Tree Pastry: Having Taiwanese breakfast at this Monterey Park newcomer is like looking at an American diner breakfast, just slightly refracted. The Taiwanese classic glutinous rice roll, called "salted rice ball" on the menu, is soft, sticky rice wrapped around a long, crispy fried doughnut with a layer of slightly sweet Chinese cotton-candy pork fluff in between. The green onion pastry, a sesame-studded morsel of golden flaky pastry, is halfway between an onion scallion pancake and a croissant. Try the savory soy milk and the sweet bean curd. You'll notice most of the regulars order the long Chinese doughnut called a "twisty curler" to dip into their bowls of soy.

As The Plain Dealer recently reported, the state of Ohio has sold well over 1 billion records of our personal information to private entities for less than a few fractions of a cent each ("State sells off your records at a bargain," July 11).

The "Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights" offers a sensible set of principles for online privacy, calling on Web companies to minimize their collection of personal data, help users make informed choices about the information they reveal, and not use personal data for new purposes without the user's consent.

This tropical beauty was discovered by the German physician and botanist Eduard Frederich Poepping (1798-1865) during a plant-hunting expedition in Chile. The original find bore scarlet blossoms, and red is still a favorite color. But today’s hybridizers have concocted flowers of rose, pink and white, as well as two-tone types with stripes or contrasting petal edges. Double-flowered varieties, dwarf kinds, even lightly scented amaryllis like “Blossom Peacock” and “Jewel” are new creations from clever breeders.

This page has argued that Iraq's civil war is beyond the United States' ability to suppress by military means and that the presence of U.S. troops can only delay the bloody but inevitable political reckoning.

Clementi, an 18-year-old freshman at Rutgers, was barely a month into his college career when his life was seemingly derailed by a secret webcam. Because it was so early in the semester, few on campus knew him well, but the slender redhead had already made an impression on Kynan Johns, associate professor and director of orchestras at Rutgers’ Mason Gross School of the Arts. Although Clementi was not a music major, he was an accomplished violinist and early in September auditioned for the Rutgers Symphony Orchestra.

What happens to property tax rebate checks? The checks are gone for the 2010 calendar year, but Christie's new budget includes some funding for a credit that would be provided in 2011 for property owners.

It wants auto makers to boost their fleets' average fuel economy by 3% to 6% a year from the 35.5 miles per gallon target already set for 2016.

The 2012 incarnation offers us Chris Diamantopoulos as Moe, Sean Hayes (Jack from "Will & Grace") as Larry, and Will Sasso as Curly. Channeling the Stooges is a tall order and Diamantopoulos, Hayes and Sasso do as well as they can under the circumstances. Hayes is the most deft at crafting an actual character, and the Farrellys smartly break the film into smaller bits to try to emulate shorts. They also insert appropriate nods to the Stooges' classic sounds and skits, including funny law firm names in tribute to Dewey, Cheatum & Howe.
Director Daniel Espinosa would have done well to remember that in his film "Safe House." Certainly, Tobin Frost, the rogue CIA agent Washington plays, has a murderous reputation, and he snaps a few necks along the way.

The survey by the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University suggests, however, that many Angelenos are relatively pessimistic about the city's overall direction.

With each push of the right leg, I felt more and more confidence. Music piped blaring from the speakers above was Top 40 main stream. I wanted to bounce up and down but feared I'd overload my balance. Right leg, left leg, right leg, left leg. It was like the 15 years of no rollerblading hadn't existed. I was no professional, by any means, but I was moving more than I would be had I opted to stay home and watch Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.

It was Kelly's final attempt to sway Armstead into the cradle of the Ducks football program.

It was an idyllic Tuesday evening at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel: temperate and clear, with a cool breeze blowing through the trees along the Garden State Parkway. This was a perfect night to get lost in a reverie, or caught up in an endless guitar groove. Conditions encouraged taking the hands from the clock. The sold-out house wanted nothing more than for Anastasio, McConnell, Fishman and Gordon, in town for the first of two shows, to plug in and play like the curfew was nothing but an ugly rumor spread by party poopers (Phish did, in fact, shatter the 11 p.m. limit on PNC shows, and the musicians surely would have kept right on soloing if the venue had let them.)
The first news was bittersweet. From Tampa Bay came word that the NFL Buccaneers had offered a ceremonial free agent contract to the former Rutgers defensive tackle Eric LeGrand, who had been paralyzed in a game in 2010.

Much of it, particularly the funniest bits, would appear to be aimed at adults. Those are delivered by Bill Nighy as now-retired Grandsanta, an unhinged loon whose bizarre asides are laugh-out-loud funny -- to grown-ups. Will a child crack up at, "They also said women couldn't learn to read?" I don't know, and in the moment, I didn't much care. Too busy laughing.

Stockton Street, San Francisco During a sun-drenched afternoon on Stockton Street in San Francisco's Chinatown, locals getting their shopping done brush past one another on sidewalks teeming with people.

Those pensions were made possible by a little-known provision slipped into a much larger pension bill that passed in 1991.

Schmidt explained all the countries we compete with have a curriculum set by the national government. These curriculums all require algebra, geometry, chemistry and physics to be taught in the seventh and eighth grades. Our students have no such demand.
