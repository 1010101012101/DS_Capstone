"It's already too late. The White House has already seen the report with conclusions," wrote Gary Strong, an engineer with the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, following a presentation by EPA deputy assistant regional administrator Martin Hestmark.

I had been spoiled by Coquina Beach, the last strand on Anna Maria before you enter Longboat Key. From the road, you could see the Gulf without obstruction and reach it easily. Once on Longboat, the buildings and bushes grew higher, the water views became scarcer, and I turned into a persona non grata.
Republicans countered with a $1.5 trillion plan that included a potential breakthrough — $250 billion in higher taxes gleaned as Congress passes a future tax reform measure. The plan was trashed by Democrats, however, who said it would have lowered tax rates for the wealthy too far while eliminating tax breaks that chiefly benefit the middle class.

One result of this is an increase in sex hormones in our streams, rivers, and drinking water. That in turn is resulting in some pretty weird biological changes in frogs. Male frogs turn into females. Other pollutants are causing them to grow multiple legs. The frogs are trying to tell us that our streams and rivers are not healthy, even if they aren't catching on fire any more.
SuperValu spokesman Mike Siemienas said Thursday he didn't know of Van Helden's future plans. In a statement, CEO Craig Herkert said: "Pete ran stores, drove integration after corporate mergers and acquisitions, and set strategy for the retail divisions. We will miss his active voice in our company and wish him all the best as he takes on new challenges outside of SuperValu."
"Stewart was our leading scorer at the time, but he was an older player," Bowman said. "He was a great skater, and the Rangers actually made the trade to get somebody who could play against Bobby Hull. But I would say that trade, besides what Glenn Hall did, really triggered us.
The Indiana Court of Appeals in February ordered a judge to set bond for Shuai, saying her defense attorneys presented sufficient evidence to rebut the murder and feticide charges. But the three-judge panel declined to dismiss the case, saying Shuai had not proven that common-law immunity exists for pregnant women who harm their own fetuses.
Small banks and credit unions had mixed reactions. They had argued that the exemption for banks under $10 billion wouldn't help if the cap was as low as originally proposed. That's because it would have invited merchants to discriminate against higher cost cards. Mary Dunn, deputy general counsel of the Credit Union National Association said the Fed "gave our concerns some consideration."
"If a German approaches," she was told, "plunge the blade into his belly, then turn it and run like hell."
Hurling — camogie for women — also had its share of social and political influence. According to Prendeville, hurling doesn't go back thousands of years like Gaelic football, but when the country was split for political and religious reasons, the Irish kept their sticks for playing hurling "in the air" while the English continued with two similar sports closer to the ground: ice hockey and field hockey.
Romney's rather flippant response to all this -- "even Jimmy Carter would have given that order" to capture or kill Bin Laden, he told reporters at a campaign event Monday -- was pretty lame, but give his speechwriters time to catch up and he'll doubtless have something better. Meanwhile, the Obama campaign is smart to play up Obama's superior experience and his proven correctness is pursuing Bin Laden. But implying that Romney might have ignored the architect of 9/11 is taking things a big step too far.

KB: There are always expectations, always pressure. But I feel as a college athlete, being at the University of Oregon, with a program that has been as dominant as we have been, there's always going to be pressure and expectations. We've all been associated with that so it's not really a big deal.

On Thursday night, the Chiefs drafted another big defensive lineman, Dontari Poe, with the 11th pick in the first round. He’ll face temptations and sales pitches, offers and opportunities.

The pipe is used in distribution systems that deliver gas to homes. DuPont warned customers about troubles with the pipe in 1982, and the National Transportation Safety Board urged pipeline companies more than a decade ago to assess their Aldyl-A pipe and remove lines with problems.

For maintaining the school's academic and conduct standards, the players receive transportation to games and help with the cost of equipment.

Hawks coach Larry Drew said he was not surprised by Pierce’s effort, especially after being held to just 12 points in the Game 1 loss. He warned his team that even without Rondo the Celtics had plenty of weapons.
For now, however, most of the disinformation involves claims about costs. Each new report from the Congressional Budget Office is touted as proof that the true cost of Obamacare is exploding, even when - as was the case with the latest report - the document says on its very first page that projected costs have actually fallen slightly. Nor are we talking about random pundits making these false claims. We are, instead, talking about people like the chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, who issued a completely fraudulent press release after the latest budget office report.

The win was Seattles 14th, the same amount as the .500 Tigers. (The Mariners have played three more games than the Tigers and are 14-17). The Tigers are 0-4 now this season against Seattle.

There also is a move afoot to make it easier for private companies to raise more money and stay private. Currently, a company can avoid registering publicly with the SEC if it has fewer than 500 shareholders. A recent report in the Wall Street Journal cited an SEC letter that suggested boosting that number, which would let private companies collect from more investors without having to register and report their financial information publicly.

While the famed Polynesian Voyaging Society canoe Hokule'a is undergoing restoration in advance of a 2012 trip around the globe, and the Bishop Museum closed its little-visited Hawai'i Maritime Center at the Aloha Tower in 2009, the Bishop Museum's ﻿planetarium helps fill the informational void with its daily "Explorers of Polynesia" and "Tropical Skies" shows. If you really want to get your feet or other extremities wet, a former Hokule'a crew member with SeaBreeze Watersports regularly takes passengers out on an outrigger sailing canoe for "speed sailing," with round-trip transport from Waikiki to the marina in Hawaii Kai for those who need it.

About the Mavericks: Dallas lost 99-92 at Golden State on Saturday night. This is the final game of a six-game trip, all of them back-to-backs ... The Mavericks are 27-12 on the road ... With six games remaining, the Mavericks own the third seed in the Western Conference and would play Portland if the season ended today ... Dallas has recorded its 11th consecutive season of 50 or more wins, becoming just the third team to accomplish that feat since the NBA went to an 82-game schedule in 1967 ...

The sienna theater, with its graceful white columns and carved stonework, reigns over Plazuela Machado, the commercial and social center of the original Spanish settlement.

It now hosts a steady schedule of events ranging from the state symphony to a local children's chorus to visiting jazz bands. The restoration also gave rise to the annual Mazatlán Cultural Festival, stretching from early November into mid-December.

In the months that followed, a compromise emerged: The volcano-bike tour buses would be allowed to carry their customers to the top of Haleakala for sunrise, but they would ferry their customers back down to 6,500 feet — just outside the park entrance — before beginning their rides. Below the park, the road isn't as steep, the turns aren't as sharp, and the roadside isn't as rocky.
There are alternatives. In an emergency, you could replace your usual margarita with a caipirinha, using a basic, low-cost cachaca such as Pitu ($13). Or switch to a pisco sour, because most piscos retail for $16 to $18. Or just stick with rum: You can pick up a bottle of 4-year-old Flor de Cana Gold rum for about $13. If Stolichnaya vodka is too pricey at $18, you could survive with Svedka at $12.

A phone number in 2011? Seriously? In an age of email and social networking, the idea of DOT operators answering phone calls from distraught passengers seems kind of old school. What's more, it seems likely that the agency would have to hire more workers to staff the call center, and since the law doesn't include any new money for it, it's unclear how the center would be funded.

I'm crazy for oysters, always have been. At Hog Island Oysters near Bodega Bay, I've been known to down three or four dozen at a time, all shucked, slowly, by me. Wherever I'm headed, you can be sure I've got the oyster bars mapped out ahead of time. So when news came that a new oyster bar was about to open across from LA Mill in Silver Lake, I was thrilled. Even sweeter, the partners in the new spot are Dustin Lancaster and Matthew Kaner, the duo that brought Los Feliz the quality wine bar Covell. That meant not only oysters, but also, in all likelihood, some seriously interesting wines to go with them.

The Simi Valley City Council approved an ordinance on Monday night that requires porn producers to insure that male performers wear condoms during sex acts.
The next day I asked the guys what I ought to do. Their solution was always the same. I had to beat the kid up or risk losing tough-guy status. The caller was in my homeroom. I walked down the desk aisle to confront him. His friend stood up first. I gave him a push and he socked me. I threw a one-two counter punch, one accidentally thumbing him in the eye, the other bloodying his nose with a loud pop.
Dimora's defense is expected to be simple: He received gifts from contractors as a token of friendship -- with no expectation that he would reciprocate by doling out public contracts or other services, according to court documents.

Paterno is expected to answer questions about the scandal for the first time Tuesday, but really, it boils down to one: Why didn’t you call the cops, Joe? Telling his superiors might have legally cleared Paterno, as the Pennsylvania state authorities said at a press conference Tuesday.
That separation is starting to occur. Temple is alone in first, a half-game ahead of SLU, and SLU is alone in second, a game ahead of Xavier and UMass. UMass has some tough games ahead, La Salle, Xavier, Datyon and Temple. If SLU can beat Xavier on Feb. 28, that would provide more valuable separation. That game isn't a must-win, but it's a win that, if other results hold, would likely settle the deal for SLU.
Off the track, he has a growing reputation as an irreverent cut-up that he enhances with off-the-wall observations at @AndrewWheating on Twitter, and in the "Behind The Stands" video series.

The coach won't apologize for the way he recruits or how he runs his program. Just playing by the rules as they're set up, he says, even if he doesn't totally agree with them. Because he refuses to promise minutes or shots to any recruit and demands teamwork out of all of them, he says he comes by these players honestly.
Property values and home prices have skyrocketed as the newcomers have moved in, energizing the town by opening shops and restaurants. They've also had some conflicts with longtime orchardists, whose intensive management includes spraying chemicals and lots of equipment noise.
Other clients face similar challenges. A man who has worked all his life but now receives Social Security disability benefits has been denied access to Indiana's Medicaid program. Another struggles with severe mental health problems certified by his psychiatrist, but has also been denied Medicaid help due to a highly questionable ruling that he does not meet Indiana's disability standard. State officials admit that more than 20,000 Hoosiers like this man have been found to be both disabled and poor by the Social Security Administration, yet are not being assisted by the Indiana-managed Medicaid program. Likely, their applications have been wrongly denied, or they have never been informed they are eligible for the help they need.
There were rumors that Marcelin had stayed out late before the game against Real Salt Lake and suffered a strained left hamstring during the game. The hamstring injury forced Marcelin to miss the games against Los Angeles and Kansas City.
After moving the shrubs outdoors, Merritt prepared the plants for a long growing season. She weeded the pots, refreshed the soil, applied Carl Pool hibiscus fertilizer and Epsom salt. She root-pruned and re-potted as needed.

And as a loving father and family law attorney, he chose the route of defense he knows best, a lawsuit. Berghouse probably can make a case that the district's policy against cheating isn't perfect. Few schools have unassailable rules.
Separate correspondence between Lupe and Bowker says the BIA offered to mediate the conflict. That proposal was accepted by five council members, who said the tribe is in crisis, but rejected by the chairman as an invasion of tribal sovereignty. However, Lupe subsequently asked for a federal review of the Tribal Court led by Armstrong, and the bureau agreed to conduct that inquiry.

Good ol' lefty, no-delay pitcher Mark Buehrle is gone, and that might have been inevitable. But will John Danks become the soul of the pitching staff? He's the Opening Day starter, and if the Sox can get off to a hot start - rather than stagger out of the gate, as they did the last two seasons - they might be able to keep folks interested for a while.
Emmonnie Henderson, who at times dominated area basketball courts all over Madison County this winter, is ready to take aim again.

Doors open at 9 a.m. on Sundays at this minimally decorated restaurant, which often lacks lines despite its delicious brunch -- think flawless Bloody Mary cocktails, Kentucky Hot Brown sandwiches and open-faced steak sandwiches with chimichurri sauce. Roost doesn't take reservations for its weekend brunch. If you've forgotten to plan ahead, that might be a good thing.
The notion that words actually mean something has been presented once more on a silver platter under Guillen's wide-open mouth.

If we were in Russia we would be having a huge parade on Red Square. Instead we are in Fairfield Township, where tonight is the monthly meeting of the Planning-Zoning Board. Once again they will be reviewing the Master Plan, hopefully in a more civil atmosphere.

As a casual but purposeful foray into the dim sum scene demonstrates, the items on a typical menu vary -- often dramatically. Most places offer staples such as the plump little crown-shaped, pork-and-shrimp stuffed dumplings known as shu mai (or siu my), an array of half-moon-shaped steamed morsels (haw go or har gow) and specialties such as lotus leaves filled with sticky rice stuffed with Chinese sausages. Not to mention delicious though acquired-taste categories such as tripe or steamed and fried chicken feet. But scores of other dishes make an appearance -- some the chef's specialties from his home region, others obviously Americanized takes on more familiar ingredients. Here are several we enjoyed during our recent tour.

And at the county Museum of History, Science and Art in Exposition Park, curators mounted temporary loan exhibitions among the mastodon skeletons. The Huntington Library displayed a superb collection of 18th century portraits and landscapes. Chouinard Art Institute, the Art Center School and Otis Art Institute offered day and evening lessons to veterans on the GI Bill. (Some would get jobs cartooning for Disney or Warner Bros.) Serious collectors could find Matisse and Picasso, Klee and Kandinsky at Earl Stendahl's gallery on Wilshire Boulevard and Frank Perls' gallery nearby, but Stendahl and Perls were practically alone.

Q: Hey, Tony: 1. Lawrence Vickers was excited the whole week to play against his old teammates. From what I saw, he dominated them, most obviously seen through the Ben Tate score early in the game. With the Browns allowing two backs to each rush for more than 100 yards, how much credit goes to Vickers as part of the devastating ground attack?
"I have used this trap with good results; it is easy, cheap, and effective," Pierce said. It will not eliminate all of the codling moths, but you will get more wormfree fruit than wormy fruit.
A longtime Essex County pol who still leads the state Senate, Codey has called Adubato both friend and foe for three decades.

The question for policymakers isn't the nature of war but how to end it. And here, the gut reactions of this week are likely to be misleading -- in the sense that they could prompt hasty decisions that bring more loss of civilian life. A retreat under fire is dangerous in any case, but especially a pell-mell retreat that abandons previous strategies for withdrawal. ... President Obama has already said that he intends to "responsibly wind down this war," as he put it Tuesday. He has agreed with NATO allies to transfer the lead combat role to the Afghans by the middle of next year and withdraw most foreign troops by the end of 2014. It's a plan framed by both the United States and its most important partners. It's not something for Americans to discard under duress because they're angry, aggrieved or even ashamed by recent events.Ahmad Majidyar of U.S. News & World Report says an early exit from Afghanistan is a "recipe for disaster":

But considering how Palin wants the government to control what you do in your bedroom by punishing you with mandatory childbirth, it's fair to examine how her own teenage daughter's pregnancy factors into this. The far right is singing hosannas for Bristol Palin, who is doing what they want to be mandatory for all women -- having a shotgun marriage and her first child just because she got pregnant. It's a bit of an understatement to suggest that average American voters do not want teenage pregnancy and marriage for their daughters. It would be a huge disservice to the public not to seize on this opportunity to educate them about the extremist fundamental right wing that apparently wholly owns the GOP, as evidenced by the fact that Palin had to be nominated as a gimme to the hard right. Apparently, John McCain -- with his 0% NARAL Pro-Choice America rating, his unwillingness to support even rape victims seeking justice and his many years of displays of submission to George W. Bush -- was still not enough to satisfy the hard right.

It's Kilauea Military Camp, a Joint Services Recreation Center where active-duty service members and veterans can reserve a cabin. It's 50 acres amid 300,000-plus-acre Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, but it makes a big impression. It's been around since 1916 and has been military-only since 1921.

Opponents say it will be struck down in court. Some provisions push the legal envelope, and if they are invalidated, it will mean going back to bargaining that has failed in the past. That's not a great prospect. But if Measure B does not pass, city unions and the council members they support will assume voters can live with the status quo. There would be every incentive to just push the growing debt down the line, like living on credit cards. After all, most or maybe even all current council members will be out of office by the time it all falls apart.

“If you look at a guy like (Walpole’s) Ryan Izzo, who could potentially have played football at many schools, who comes here and plays lacrosse and he plays with a chip on his shoulder,” Cannella continued. “He plays hard-nosed lacrosse and, in my opinion, that’s kind of what we need. Even a guy like Grant Whiteway (Billerica) and Andrew Sokol (Newburyport). Grant got a lot of recognition but Andrew got none and he’s a fantastic player. They bring some attitude and toughness to the field, and obviously we love that here.”

If your daughter does decide to get a pet, offer to walk with her every day. If there is a local park that's suitable for daily strolls, suggest that location. The great thing about walking in a park or a local greenbelt is that usually lots of other dog owners are doing the same thing. Dog people are a chatty, friendly bunch. They talk about their dogs more than they talk about their kids (if they have kids). When one passes the same people with the same dogs every day, it's hard not to develop something of a bond, and before you know it, you're smiling at strangers, and not long after that, conversations ensue. It's great.

So, despite having zero background in the food business, Chouinard decided to launch his own salmon fishery. Patagonia Provisions, which debuted at the beginning of April, sells packets of salmon jerky ($12.50 for two ounces) next to rain jackets, hiking pants and organic cotton shirts. The salmon is caught in British Columbia's Skeena River, using traditional equipment that the company describes as "First Nations fish wheels and dip nets." Chouinard has so far poured $1.3 million into this curious experiment. He isn't sure when he'll make it back. "I can't help myself," he says. "I just want to show the fishing industry how it can be done."
Mr. Romney's own passions, in contrast, often are revealed in generalized accounts of saving this or that corporation, or building it from scratch in the impersonal world of high finance.

Syrian state media on Friday proclaimed army units were "working to restore security, stability and normal life to Hama," which it said had been taken over by "terrorists."

The bill does not affect the tens of millions of dollars in state tax subsidies for companies such as SolarWorld and SoloPower that manufacture alternative energy components.

For one thing, Socha (Robert Wieckiewicz) is no saint. He's also not a wealthy industrialist, like Schindler.

Reliable options: One of our servers practically forced the milk-braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes ($10) on us, and we were glad she did. Fork-tender and sufficiently marbled (read: fatty), this hunk of hog satisfied on a cool spring day. Like grandma's Sunday roast, but refined. The pork-fried almonds with rosemary and garlic ($5) were a nice starter, if a bit greasy. But since that grease was pork fat, we had few complaints.

A: He is a guy who is playing to his strengths, mainly converting timely shots, keeping mistakes down, and understanding most of his work comes off the ball. Even Thursday, while filling the scoring column, he went without an assist. But the prime reason he has thrived this series is there has been very little in the way of a defensive challenge. That will change soon enough, when Chalmers will have to work on both ends.

JLWOP is inconsistent with the principles of fairness and proportionality. The Eighth Amendment to the Constitution requires that criminal sentences be proportionate to the underlying offenses and reflect "evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society."

There are many measures that tell us this, but none more important that our eyes and what we see. With Jon Jay taking over in center, Carlos Beltran in right, and Rafael Furcal now at shortstop for a full season, the Cardinals have a better defensive club entering this season that (arguably) they had at any point in time last season. That's not a surprise. The Cardinals gave a little glove to get more bat last season before switching gears in time to chew up that 10 1/2-game deficit. This year's club is a more pitching/defense-oriented roster (league-leading runs aside), and the gloves are supposed to be better.
