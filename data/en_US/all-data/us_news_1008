If McIlroy were to win, say, seven majors over his career, he would join an elite fraternity. Only 10 golfers have won as many: Nicklaus, Woods, Bobby Jones (13, including six U.S. and British Amateurs in an era when they were considered majors), Walter Hagen (11), Ben Hogan (9), Gary Player (9), Tom Watson (8), Palmer (7), Sam Snead (7) and Gene Sarazen (7). The youngest of that group to win a major was Sarazen, who proudly recalled that distinction at the 1996 Masters when somebody mentioned how skilled Woods was for a 20-year-old amateur.
"There is something to memory complaints," said Miriam Weber, the neuropsychologist whose findings were published in March in the online version of the journal Menopause.
"I remember a few days ago everyone was talking about the bullpen and what was going to happen," Samardzija said. "That's what we all expect out of them. That's what they're going to give us all year. It's nice as a pitcher when your offense gives you nine (runs) and your bullpen gives you four (innings). I was just in the right place at the right time."

Bales has not yet been charged in the killings in Afghanistan. He was flown Friday from Kuwait to the military’s only maximum-security prison, at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. When the Air Force cargo jet with the soldier aboard arrived at Kansas City International Airport, about an hour from the military prison, security was very tight, with the terminal completely blocked off. It marked the tragic end of Bales’ fourth tour of duty in a war zone, one his lawyer said he had hoped to avoid.

Indeed, the European bailout was much larger than analysts expected, and represented an audacious step by European leaders who had been criticized for acting tentatively, and without unity, in the face of a mounting crisis. The plan includes guarantees for loans issued by European countries as well as a promise by the European Central Bank to buy large amounts of government bonds. "This is huge," said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities in New York. "It's a big program; it's substantive; it's unexpected."

Maybe it's the offense not the defense. You can't play possession soccer and keep passing the ball back to your defenders. We quit pressing forward. Ten shots in the first half, three in the second. For Chivas, just the reverse, four in the first, ten or eleven in the second. You can't give away the mid-field to the opposing team.

The harmonica was invented in Europe a century or so before it became one of the most definitive colors of American music. The earliest recordings were made in the blues idiom, aimed solidly at the African-American "race" market. Yet it seems typical of the U.S. attitude toward its own culture that the harmonica was dismissed here until Adler proved it could handle Debussy and Brahms.

“No one is being ordered,” said Boston Police Department spokesman James Kenneally. “A limited number of on-duty officers have been asked to attend the speech. The more that can attend, the better. Staffing levels will be sufficient to allow some, but not everyone, to attend the commissioner’s speech. The commissioner wants to take the opportunity to thank the men and women of the Boston Police Department for their hard work and dedication to duty.”

As for a generation ago, the OECD considered the United States the world leader because most of the world's college graduates were from the United States. In terms of percentage of population, though, the U.S. numbers were slightly behind the much smaller nation of Israel. That's a point of clarification.

I don't know about all of that. I need to be convinced that if the tournament expands to 96 teams why the first weekend of the tournament will still be as fascinating as it is now. My greatest fear is that if the NCAA isn't carefully monitored the added weekend of games will be nothing more than a glorified elimination tournament of the mid-majors or an excuse to continue to dump even more power-conference teams into the field no matter how lousy their regular-season records might be.
Even so, the sight of Rose going down late in Saturday’s 103-91 victory sent a major chill through Chicago and stirred a debate over whether he should have been in the game at that point. Players and general manager Gar Forman publicly defended Thibodeau’s decision, but losing Rose to many wiped out whatever chance the Bulls have at advancing to the NBA finals, much less winning it all.

If you're traveling in a country with questionable water, keep in mind that you have to avoid exposure to local water in all of its forms. That means no ice cubes (other than in high-end hotels that promise use of bottled water in their ice-making), brushing your teeth with bottled water, and avoiding taking in any water when you shower. Yes, it's often a fuss, but a bad bout of diarrhea is much more of a fuss.
The 2010 movie isn't as good as the book, and some people didn't think much of the book in the first place. But it's hard to fault the beautiful scenes of Rome and its eye for food from the "Eat" ("no carb left behind") portion of the movie about a woman's search for identity and true love.

In Castor & Pollux's case, Connolly said it kept its investment under wraps for competitive reasons.
Oskar's world starts off as a very narrow one. There is his working mom, with Bullock effectively dimming her normal bright light to play Oskar's not always likable mom, and John Goodman's insult-trading doorman offering some comic relief. The boy's main confidant, at least initially, is his grandmother. Played by veteran stage actress Zoe Caldwell ("The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"), she lives in the facing apartment building, ideal for walkie-talkie conversations late at night when Oskar's worries escalate. Her apartment also houses the mysterious Renter (Max von Sydow), who will figure into Oskar's life in significant ways.

For a taste of that past, check out Earnestine and Hazel's (531 S. Main St.; 901-523-9754). This Memphis mainstay was once a brothel and a shady after-show hangout for musicians.

With the way Hamels has pitched and the Braves have hit lately, that 2-0 lead in the fourth did not look easily surmountable. But Brian McCann answered in the bottom of the fourth with a leadoff homer against the left-hander.

According to some Web noodling: Even sold as a single fryer, the chicken is probably worth $2 a pound. Figure you get half its weight in sellable meat and the butcher would charge for $5,000. Recycled steel fetches 13 cents a pound on a good day, so $650 for that route.
May 1 is International Workers Day, a holiday embraced in Europe, but not so much here.

"None of the money was given to the Levoy," Ayres said. "They submit Drawdowns (a record that determines an investment's financial risk) monthly or every two months, whenever it occurs in the construction. And if they're all in line, then the check comes down to be disbursed to the vendors and contractors. Again, the theater was not given any money."

But the cheers Obama heard Tuesday as he opened a two-day, three-college swing masked a more daunting reality as he seeks to mobilize young voters to his side once again. Obama is no longer the avatar of promise and possibility; he is the incumbent presiding over an anemic job market awaiting future graduates. He is a figure of compromised ideals asking for forbearance as he seeks to live up to the sky-high expectations he inspired the first time around.
"The last time (Went the Day Well) worked at Keeneland, he just didn't seem to want to go on from his workmate. That was the icing on the cake."
Pixar, ultimately the more successful venture, seemed at first a bottomless money pit. Then in 1995 came "Toy Story," the first computer-animated full-length feature. Jobs used its success to negotiate a sweeter deal with Disney for Pixar's next two films, "A Bug's Life" and "Toy Story 2." Jobs sold Pixar to The Walt Disney Co. for $7.4 billion in stock in a deal that got him a seat on Disney's board and 138 million shares of stock that accounted for most of his fortune. Forbes magazine estimated Jobs was worth $7 billion in a survey last month.

* Steelers pass rusher James Harrison used Media Day to mock NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. Harrison was fined repeatedly by Goodell this season for helmet-first hits on quarterbacks and receivers. "I don't want to hurt nobody," Harrison said. "I don't want to step on nobody's foot or hurt their toe.

Last year, he suffered a season-ending knee injury in November.

The Hornets are used to being the class of PSAL boys lacrosse and are the league’s defending Class A city champions. With 16 seniors graduated, though, this year has gotten off to a much slower start. Building early momentum was hurt by the fact that renovations are being done on the Hornets home field, thus limiting practice times and routines.

They tried to hire new surgeons. They crafted a marketing campaign to attract new patients. They begged regulators for more time. They sidelined people who complained and looked past doctors' egos and what Hoefs described as their "peculiar behaviors." They hung on by persuading two doctors from UC San Diego to work part-time.
The right plan can artfully incorporate more furnishings than you might expect. Smaller scaled bedroom sets and efficient storage are key to keeping the space feeling uncluttered and welcoming. Anything that serves more than one purpose – such as an end-of-bed storage bench or a bedside table that has several drawers – is especially welcome. A small room tends to draw more attention to displays of collectibles, so create small groupings of your favorite things and use them to draw the eye to certain areas of the room. Keep in mind that you can increase the sense of spaciousness by choosing closed, streamlined storage. Tables, beds and chairs that sit high off the floor make rooms appear airier and less cluttered.
Tokyo's market found some support after the improved U.S. manufacturing numbers helped to lift the greenback back above the ¥80 mark overnight.

Matthew Davis tells us he doesn’t care what you think about the records he likes. But don’t judge him on that — judge him by what he’s willing to spin at parties. On the ambitious “Last Glittering Thrill,” he hands us a playlist, singing about the old Three O’Clock and Plasticland records on his turntable. Those bands made sharply written psychedelic guitar-pop — immersive, urgent, occasionally murky and pleasantly skewed. He’s chased — and captured — those virtues himself on “Believe in Sound,” the debut album by his latest outfit, the Thousand Pities. A longtime Garden State resident who now lives in Montclair, Davis has made some talented friends in Jersey pop: Stanley Demeski of the Feelies plays percussion on the brief “From the Air,” Deena Shoshkes of the Cucumbers sings harmony on the engrossing “Point Pleasant.” Davis’ regular band is awfully impressive, too, especially powerhouse drummer Ken Meyer and synth player Billy Donohue, who adds twinkle and purr to the occasionally downcast material. As for Davis himself, he possesses an emotionally resonant, weather-beaten voice that he puts to good use on ballads “Super-High Moon” and “Gone to Stay.” One of the best local releases of 2011 so far? Heck, forget about “local.”
Securing credit from a commercial lender can be a challenge for any farmer. It's especially challenging for new producers, who lack a long business history, and for farmers and ranchers with less conventional business models. That includes those selling to local stores, restaurants, and institutions or directly to consumers – Oregon's local food producers.
Dicecapades: Outnumbered (Haywire, $26; 3-6 players; age 12+; 30 min.) A promising idea for a light, fast-moving trivia game that founders on the reefs of poor follow-through. Each player rolls 10 dice, then competes with others to answer questions whose answers are all numbers; the trick is that you're eligible to answer only if all the digits in your answer are represented among your dice. Unfortunately, nearly all the questions are either too easy (quarts in a gallon) or too hard (languages spoken worldwide) to be any fun. And some are pure dada, like "Q: Paul Revere's ride? A: 12."

Beyond that, however, no additional Harford highway improvements have been funded past the conceptual stage, and the state has actually pushed back consideration of adding additional travel lanes on I-95 north of Route 24 in Abingdon. Harford County elected officials believe the interstate highway needs to be widened to a uniform width through the county, with a new interchange built at I-95 and Route 22, the latter being the main route into APG for people who work on post. Also long unresolved is the widening of Route 22 from Aberdeen to Route 543 east of Bel Air, the main route from the interior of the county to Aberdeen.
It apparently is unhip to have a staircase with risers. Risers are the boards the toe hits when a foot goes too far on the step. Minimalist steps seemingly float in air (and handrails are optional). I climb such stairs with great care, mindful of a friend whose leg slipped through. He snapped a quadriceps and spent two months in rehab. He was not a hipster, it is true.

"The first time she got the region player of the year award as a freshman, she asked, 'What's this for?'" Barris said. "When I told her, she asked, 'Well, what did everybody else on the team get?' She's so modest and puts the team before anything. She's a different kid."
"All the major candidates were excluded because of not fulfilling one or two of the legal conditions," said Amr Hashim Rabee, an analyst at Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo.

When a ballplayer starts the season 0-for-12, his first hit is not just a breakthrough, but an unburdening.
To anyone with a functioning memory, however, this whining is implausible. So are the dire predictions that the president will somehow offend voters by claiming credit for whacking bin Laden (or by smacking Romney). During the Bush presidency, Republicans used precisely the same approach and worse, over and over, without fretting whether their words and ads were "divisive."
Take memory. Thirty-year-olds forget lots of things, but they don't blame dementia. Older people jump to the conclusion that memory failures are part of their inevitable decline, when in fact it could be that their values change about what's meaningful enough to remember, Langer said.

But meeting fans' expectations could prove challenging, Dolich said. Not all venues are well suited for Wi-Fi or for offering decent cellphone connection, he said. And fans aren't going to be happy if, even with the new technology, the team can't handle what Dolich calls "the basics," like keeping waiting lines short at the concession stand or in the parking lot.

So why not bring up Mike Trout, just as they did Peter Bourjos, give him the Bobby Abreu at-bats so he can experience more big league pitching sooner and at the same time provide more speed in the outfield and on the bases? Wouldn't that impact the club? Or is waiting three weeks for each Abreu RBI a better idea?

A lot of people, if asked to pick their favorite Van Morrison album, would go with 1968's "Astral Weeks."

“What this change means practically: Senior campaign officials as well as some White House and Cabinet officials will attend and speak at Priorities USA fundraising events,” Messina wrote. “While campaign officials may be appearing at events to amplify our message, these folks won't be soliciting contributions for Priorities USA. I should also note that the president, vice president, and first lady will not be a part of this effort; their political activity will remain focused on the president's campaign.”

A: You are probably on the right track in examining the car's anti-theft system. A number of General Motors vehicles from the early 2000s had similar trouble. Try seeking mechanics who have experience correcting it. My understanding is that a sure way to fix the problem is to disable the anti-theft system.
I knew who Franchon Crews was. She the only one who I was worried about. I wasn't looking at No. 2 or No. 3. I was worried about her. And when I looked her up and I seen her fight, I said, 'If that's what No. 1 is, it's over.'
Baker was reserved until you got to know her, Parry said. They enjoyed doing craft projects, seeing movies or walking to Dairy Queen. Baker also bowled in a league in Apple Valley.
It's no wonder that Teague spent a good portion of his introductory news conference explaining why folks shouldn't be concerned about that little gap. He spent his first 13 years in athletic administration closely aligned with marketing BCS football programs at Virginia, Arizona State and North Carolina, and part of the attraction of coming to Minnesota, he said, was the chance to get back to a BCS football program.

Illinois is an object lesson in why firms are starting to pay more attention to the long-term fiscal prospects of communities. Early last year, the state imposed $7 billion in new taxes on residents and business, pledging to use the money to eliminate its deficit and pay down a backlog of unpaid bills (to Medicaid providers, state vendors and delayed tax refunds to businesses). But more than a year later, the state is in worse fiscal shape, with its total deficit expected to increase to $5 billion from $4.6 billion, according to an estimate by the Civic Federation of Chicago.

Now, my family is spread out around the country -- and the chocolates don't travel well. So I created a cookie version of the confection to capture similar flavors. The cookie base has a slightly chewy, brownie-like texture, with a crackling chocolate top. Since cherries are not in season, dried cherries are coarsely chopped and studded throughout the batter. The recipe calls for extra chocolate chunks that ooze from the baked cookies; they add a level of intensity that can easily be omitted.

TRENTON — Gov. Chris Christie's proposed 10-percent income tax cut for all New Jersey residents, revealed this afternoon in his State-of-the-State address, would give more of a break to wealthy New Jerseyans than for middle- and low-income families, leaving them vulnerable to further cuts in education, health care and other services they need to weather the recession, Democrats said.

Who knows what Urlacher is like outside of football? But Urlacher's public persona today is what a star professional athlete should be. He still won't give you deep thoughts if he doesn't have any.

It's not easy hiking the 1.2-mile Summit Trail to the top of the Phoenix mountain. But it's a great exercise program not only because of the aerobic activity and muscle building the climb provides but also because other climbers can be so entertaining. Plus it's so crowded you'll never walk alone.

"This is a very difficult, rewarding way to play," Hitchcock said. "That's why anyone who plays this way has to play four lines. ... To ask a player to skate full-out for 40 seconds without resting and then, at the end of it, sprint off the ice is not an easy thing. It takes a lot to play that way, but all the top teams play that way. The whole game is about back pressure, tempo and 200 feet.

Industry experts say there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the port of Norfolk. They say it has excellent facilities, as well as railroad connections that Baltimore and other ports can only envy.

Credit for the boulevard's promising start goes to the design concept, which is a collaboration between Jacobs Macdonald: Cityworks and city staff led by the Department of Public Works. If anything, you wish the planners had won a few more battles. The "local" lanes should have bumpy paving to give drivers a tactile cue to slow down, for instance. But the convenience of having asphalt over the boulevard's buried service lines won out with engineers.
On April 3, the Reserve Bank of Australia said it might cut rates if inflation doesn't become a problem.

SCOUTING REPORT: Kentucky's size, speed and scoring ability from anywhere on the court present nightmarish problems for most opponents. The Wildcats are the best transition team in the country and also hold opponents to nation-best 37.5% shooting. Terrence Jones is a streaky player but when he's playing well Kentucky is all but unbeatable. Anthony Davis, of course, is a shot-blocking fiend with his 7-5 wingspan but has improved offensively during the course of the season. Louisville has trouble generating points but has won of late with a stingy 2-3 zone defense that likes to funnel traffic inside toward center Gorgui Dieng, who averages more than three blocks a game.
The power of the purse, in fact, is where the GOP House majority can exercise its real power. Boehner and his colleagues want to push spending back to 2008 levels.

Best smackdown: This one was delivered by Seminole County Supervisor of Elections Mike Ertel, who was there as a neutral party to talk about the effect on local ballots. Houck had just trotted out another development-lobby talking point, about how Hometown Democracy would confuse all the poor, uninformed voters. To which Ertel responded that Americans cast ballots for the most important office on Earth — the presidency — based upon simply the first and last name of the candidates.

And therein lies an important Thanksgiving turkey lesson. It's always good to have at least one common element between the turkey, stuffing and gravy.

Taylor took over as quarterback after Mertens sustained a rib injury in the fourth quarter.
The Bears seem to believe they will upgrade their offensive line with the return of injured right tackle Gabe Carimi and injured left guard Chris Williams (with the unspoken upgrade of Mike Tice coordinating the offense instead of Mike Martz).

The effort was supposed to be financed by a $15 per acre charge to those companies that hold gas interest to the land. The Maryland Department of the Environment was counting on collecting as much as $2.3 million from the study fee to pay for research.

If you can read only one book, however, it should be "Titanic: First Accounts" (Penguin), in which editor Tim Maltin gathers classic inquiries and early testimonies from survivors. It is a stunning record of firsthand stories and early reports. "The ship was gradually turning on her nose — just like a duck does that goes down for a dive," recalls radio operator Harold S. Bride. "I had only one thing on my mind — to get away from the suction." The book is full of such accounts, as chilling to read today as the North Atlantic waters were on that fateful night.

Controlling your PC or Mac remotely becomes a completely different thing on the new iPad. The Retina display has greater resolution than many laptops, even. When you run an iPad VNC client (like Screens or iTeleport), the experience is very close to that of having a fully-functional -- albeit slightly slow -- desktop computer in front of you. Even when you're connecting back to your desktop computer via an LTE connection, it's quite a credible experience. There's no need to scrunch the screen down to give yourself enough working room, and you don't need to zoom in to make things legible and useful.
"A dance teacher who was laid off would not come back because a mathematics teacher retired," said John Crowe, superintendent of the Woodbridge school district, where about 25 percent of certified staff was eligible to retire.
Duckworth was a starter on two NBA Finals teams with the Blazers, reaching that pinnacle through hard work and self-motivation. Duckworth attended Thornridge High School, a basketball power outside of Chicago, and did not make the basketball team his freshman year because he missed school the day of tryouts.

The Charlotte Observer, the state's largest newspaper, voiced opposition to the amendment: "North Carolina already bans same-sex marriage by state law so this constitutional change is unnecessary.

I'm beginning to suspect that the Oval Office teleprompter may be malfunctioning, or that perhaps that NBC News producer who "accidentally" edited George Zimmerman into sounding like a racist has now edited the smartest president of all time into sounding like an idiot.

So far, I thought, looking up at the startlingly bright desert stars, so good.
Christie, a Republican, campaigned for GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill Brady, who lost the election to Democrat Pat Quinn.

"True Blood" (9 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 29, HBO): With only two more episodes left in the cable drama's don't-blink third season, a seriously disturbed Russell (Denis O'Hare) seems poised for one royal showdown with Eric (Alexander Skarsgard) and, well, just about everybody. Is that why Eric took Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) prisoner at the end of last week's episode -- as bait to lure Russell into a confrontation? Sookie, after all, just learned that she's part fairy and that her blood is particularly intoxicating and desirable to vampires. Any way you play this high-stakes game, Sookie is going to have some major trust issues with the vampires in her life.

This band from Stillwater, Okla., follows the map drawn by its honky-tonk forebears: driving fiddle, and touring the well-worn Red Dirt route through Arkansas, Texas and New Mexico. But lead songwriter Evan Felker also calls up contemporary images, such as the soldier writing a letter "beneath a big Afghan moon" in "Southeastern Son," and a vivid car crash in "Before the Devil Knows We're Dead."

Agatha Christie was not cozy. She earned the title the Queen of Crime the old-fashioned way — by killing off a lot of people. Although never graphic or gratuitous, she was breathtakingly ruthless. Children, old folks, newlyweds, starlets, ballerinas — no one is safe in a Christie tale. In "Hallowe'en Party," she drowns a young girl in a tub set up for bobbing apples and, many chapters later, sends Poirot in at the very last minute to prevent a grisly infanticide. In "The ABC Murders," she sets up one of the first detective-taunting serial killers.
