At the report Mata Hari fell. She did not die as actors and moving picture stars would have us believe that people die when they are shot. She did not throw up her hands nor did she plunge straight forward or straight back.
Still in the midst of it, I remembered 2 Thessalonians 5:17, "give thanks in all circumstances." I thanked God for the chance to provide this nutrition to my child. For a full year of nursing. For an awesome husband to care for me. And for this happening on a weekend when we had family in town to help with Lil in the morning. (thanks, Grammy!)
Zimbabwe is limping from a position of a semi-colony under economic siege in a degenerating capitalist system that is forced to resort to brutal wars in order to guarantee some stability in a perspective of impending collapse for a system that has ruined livelihoods and survives thanks to the betrayals of the so-called workers leaders. With the working class demoralized and betrayed by these so-called leaders the national end game is now firmly in the hands of the two poles of imperialism as witnessed by the so-called 'u turn' by SADC on Zimbabwe which is nothing but a logical outcome of a managed transition that excludes or manipulates the masses of any nation. China has decided to sacrifice its interests in Zimbabwe for those of South Africa which can be threatened by a shift of political ground in that country and it is also probable that the US promised not to threaten the interests of China.
Dr Starkey called for better teaching of English history to create a “common identity” and overcome the challenges of multiculturalism.
I looked at the skies,
I would like to hear what your opinion is in these matters. Please comment.
That decision I made in September 1981 was the best of my life. I've never regretted it for a single second. I was told by some people that I was missing out on things - going out with different people, parties, holidays abroad. I should be buying clothes, make-up etc rather than things for my ' bottom drawer' - in their words I shouldn't be 'tying myself down'.
This is without doubt the biggest presidential scandal in my lifetime . Watergate , Iran-Contra , Monica Lewinski were embarrassing but no one died as a result . The dinosaur media bootlickers have shown to all where their loyalties lie . Not with truth telling but with advancing the chosen narrative .

Ah yes, the train. I preferred to change the subject. This delay dwindled my chances of making the twice weekly run across the plains. “What do you think about the judicial process here, is it effective?” I asked already knowing the response. “It’s difficult, I’m up against a very corrupt system,” he began, staring out at the ocean of cars. “Those with money can buy themselves out trouble, those without any influence get taken advantage of.” He adjusted the briefcase on his lap; now he looked directly at me. “That’s the only good thing about this government, they’re fighting corruption. But they ignore the bigger problems just to pat themselves on the back over a few big fish.”

It is already Christmas eve here in China. We are missing all the preparations leading up to the big day. Christmas decorations are up here, but it focuses on the commercial aspect of Christmas. We found out that we will be able to go to church on Christmas morning, and we are looking forward to that.
Every morning about a foot from where the water rose, broken beer bottles and glass shards scattered across the ground. We had to be careful where we stepped and always keep our shoes on. Especially when we played in the water, so that we could scare away the sting rays that loved to burrow into the sand at the bottom, by dragging our feet as we entered.

Muckaty Station, another remote Aboriginal community, risks being the site for Australia’s nuclear waste dump despite opposition from most of the traditional owners in the community. Again with rare bi-partisan support the Federal Parliament recently passed the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010. The decision is being challenged in the Federal Court. Jagath Dheerasekara’s photographic series Manuwangku: Under the Nuclear Cloud has been part of FotoFreo in West Australia and will be seen in Sydney as part of the Head On Photo Festival from 1 May.
Like all the German foods I ate growing up, I learned to make these in the American Midwest where German, Swiss, and Austrian bakeries, Konditoreien, sausage shops, and butchers were commonplace and the Germanic (or, as we called it, “Dutchy”) influence on home cooking was pervasive. The older I get, the less I eat the German foods of my youth. But as I work through our bacon inventory, I’ve been building a craving for a bowl of Speckklöße.
After William the Conqueror comes The Bucket and the Rope by T.F Powys, which is one of the most original stories I have ever read - it's narrators are, in fact, a bucket and a rope. E.M Forster follows Powys, with a story called The Road from Colonus. I am mildly allergic to E.M. Forster, so probably cannot provide a fair assessment of the story. It deals with an Englishman abroad who has an epiphany, a theme that I have the impression was regularly on Forster's mind. Its tone is mildly flippant, I think - or perhaps I just took it the wrong way. It irritated me.
Glad to see I have two followers besides myself. Furthermore, the few comments I've recevied already make me feel better about this wedding stuff, there's a whole world out there of virtual support that I've jsut begun to tap into!

The game was odd from the beginning. In a cross promotion with McDonald's for their Egg McMuffin sandwich, the game started at 10:30 in the morning. Jim went 3 for 3 with two home runs, including a grand slam. He tied the franchise record for RBI in a single game, set originally by Carl Reynolds on July 2, 1930. The mark has had such diverse company as Tommy McCraw and Robin Ventura. What makes Spencer's feat so remarkable is that he matched it on July 2, 1977 against the Minnesota Twins.

It was amazing to Stolik how easy it was to lose men in the steppe. He didn’t mean casualties – he’d barely had any of those – but rather the literal meaning of “lose”. The broad, flat, open plains could somehow swallow you and, if you wandered too far and didn’t keep a keen eye on your compass, you’d be as lost as any sailor at sea. Stolik had sent Dantrich off on patrol with three men to try and round up any of the villagers who had tried to slip off. They hadn’t come back.

Of course, I had NOT just spent the past several hours breaking out of prison, so I was in fine form to run back to the house and do the only natural thing: Post the news to all my networks.

He told me that he worked the doors at a casino on Auinger St. His mate was across the road talking to a big Russian guy and it looked like the situation would boil over, so he went across and dragged his mate back across the road again.The Russian guy who was out of his mind was insulting both of them so he dragged his mate back to the casino. The Russian followed them taunting and whistling at them. "So I told him to go back home to Russia where there was plenty of idiots there like himself he could fight with"

Unable to convince by force of argument and unwilling to consider alternatives to the fanatically asserted insistence that this was a racially-motivated murder, and clearly frustrated by DS Davidson’s sticking to his guns, Macpherson accuses those who do not accept his assumptions as being guilty of “unwitting collective racism”. Indeed, at times, Macpherson is like a believer whose faith, threatened by the very existence of non-believers, begins to doubt his belief in God and so resorts to endless repetitions of “God exists!” in an attempt to bolster his weakening faith. Macpherson’s response to DS Davidson’s reasonable interpretation typifies the hysteria that has accompanied the inquiry. According to Macpherson, DS Davidson’s refusal to accept that this crime was racist ‘may well have affected his approach to the case.’ (para, 19.44). To which one must add that Macpherson’s handling of the inquiry, especially his treatment of the police, has been markedly skewed by his uncritical acceptance that this was a racially-motivated murder.

Couldn’t help myself. I’m not a very political person but have been reading a lot about this in the newspapers and couldn’t ignore it no matter how hard I tried, so here goes.
I think I’m making it sound more boring than it is, but I want to really fix this in my memory, and in the blog’s memory. This is the first Pulitzer novel that’s not only been sympathetic to a minority, but has actually succeeded in treating minority characters with the dignity and respect of being real human beings. In order to do that, La Farge has to jettison a lot of other things. But the result is this quiet little novel that begins in childish joy and ends with very mature grief, a novel that, 80 years later, is still moving (to me, at least) because it makes its characters too real for me to avoid feeling their emotions alongside them. He finds a way of writing that simultaneously makes the foreignness of their phrases clear (they speak a different language than I do) and yet does not destroy their intelligence by dumbing down the dialogue. I don’t know if high schoolers today would sit still for Laughing Boy. But if they did, I think more of them would connect with the story than wouldn’t, and in the end it would spark the right kind of conversations about America. That is can still do that now makes it a worthy Pulitzer winner, in my book, even if it isn’t Wharton (and it’s not).

“The response to our cans has been tremendous! We announced that we would be doing so about six months before it actually happened, and so we spent a lot of time engaged in conversations about the virtues of cans with the people who love our beer. That, coupled with a lot of positive press for cans nationwide, has really paved the way. Plus, cans are the first time Sun King has been available in a small package. Our fans are really excited about our new, highly portable container.”
Well, it has more taste than smell, and is low in the plastic taste, but high in adjunct grains as well. Feels dead. Tastes flat. I hope it's just out of date. If this is how they make their beers on purpose, they'll be out of business soon.

But October the 26th is the anniversary of a rare event in England – a bomb attack on an mp’s home in 1965. This is a lesson that de-humanising a politician could have fatal consequences as happened to Pym Fortuyn and Theo Van Gogh. Mr.Griffiths had been Member of Parliament for Smethwick (now Warley) for just a year. He had been leader of the Conservative group on the council and won the election of 15th October 1964 against a national swing to Labour, which was led by Harold Wilson. The defeated MP Patrick Gordon Walker was Foreign Secretary designate and a personal friend of Wilson. Mr.Griffith’s turned Walker’s 3,544 majority into 1,774 for the Conservatives.
In this blog, we will discuss differences between wood and plastic cutting boards. Carolina Wood Designs’ boards are obviously, well, wood! But perhaps this will dispel questions about why you might choose a wood board over a plastic one. .
Many in this country have a decidedly sexist view of a strong woman. When a woman speaks her mind she is labelled a “bitch.” A man doing the same would be called “strong” or “admirable.” When a woman rises to the top in business or politics and raises a ruckus for the rights of other women she is labelled a “feminist.” When a man rises to the top in business or politics he is labelled a “success.”
As for Islam not being spread by the sword, the Mufti and Muslims who think like him have willfully blinded themselves to the sack of Byzantium, the jihad against India and the Islamic invasion of Southern Europe, among many other events of Islam's bloody history. And that's not to mention the body count of the modern Islamist war against the west, which is still ongoing.

Cut back to the lake and just before she dies Dana is saved by Marty. He leads her back to the zombie grave and they climb into an underground area. Dana can see a brightly lit room beneath them and Steve explains it’s an elevator of some kind. In they go to see who’s behind everything. Instead of the elevator moving straight down, it’s actually a prison cube and soon the two survivors are seeing all manner of monsters trapped in these cages. They realize that these monsters correspond with the artifacts in the cellar. After the monster zoo, they’re dumped into the main facility, where they have to fight security guards who are trying to kill them. They hide in a security room and Dana releases all the monsters. Appearing with the now ominous ding of an elevator arriving at your floor, monsters come pouring out of their cages in waves.

First, when I go to the place (eg: Haiti). I will try to first ask what can be done to help people. If there is a job, I like;. I will ask for the particular job. Suppose I get a job to help people clean land and help new houses. I will see where people need help, I will ask them how I can help them, where I can help them etc., I will try to gather materials to help them to build a house. I will also bring buckets to make water out. I will also try to help and build new school plant trees, make shops & things like that.

In doing her research, Kolker speaks of asking immigrants this question: “What habit do you think people from your country should hang on to when they move here?”. One little girl’s response to this question, “Little shops you can walk to”, resonates with me deeply. Having lived in communities that have semi-public spaces, porches, parks, sidewalks, and shops one can walk to, my affection for these neighborhoods stems less from a laziness to drive, than from a sort of near desperate longing for the kind of living that is associated with a walker-friendly community. Kolker associates such neighborhoods with protection from asthma, but she doesn’t have to convince me.
The hot beats should help with that one.

Well, I spent some time in a well-known London children’s hospital, getting a sense of what it felt like and how things worked. I can’t tell you how much I came to admire the staff there, and I can honestly say that they are heroes to me. I have a close friend who is a paediatrician herself, and I also made contact with a cardiac nurse at Alder Hey hospital; both of them shared their expertise with great generosity. Satish is a fractured human being, deeply fallible, but for the most part he is an excellent doctor. It was important to me that we get to see him being brilliant at least some of the time.
The heartbreak theme came to me when I was contemplating the ones that got away, and the fact that I both allowed and condoned such a turn of events. Being me is an odd proposition.

A small part of me has always felt guilty for not pursuing a career in a science-based field. While my father has always insisted he wanted my brothers and I to do whatever we felt called to, I think he secretly would have been thrilled had I expressed a desire to become an anaesthesiologist or, better yet, an orthodontist.

As a child growing up I would see this scenario every once-in-a-while. Bobby, pulls girls hair, made fun of weaker kids, and picked on those scared to retaliate. Bobby deserves an attitude adjustment (ass whippin’). I called Bobby out to meet me after school so that some adjusting could occur (I was a teacher’s son, and didn’t want to fight on school property). Another incident involved my brother changing the channel of the tv after the majority voted on the show we were all watching. Words were not getting through to him and after he threw a drinking glass at me (made of heavy glass) I decked him.
Do any of y'all know how I can fix this or prevent it from happening and causing my blog to disappear?
My son was scared of the waves at the Pacific Ocean beaches when we visited those when he was 1 and 2 years old. And he's been wary of the water ever since. At my family's cottage, he's always loved riding in the speedboat, but was never big on playing in the water until this summer. He still was nowhere close to swimming.

No one's going to put a microchip in your ass that makes you worship the devil, okay? I had a whole bunch of absolutely batshit hallucinations living in that cave, but black helicopters and butt microchips weren't in any of them.

In Britain the non-white population is growing at a rate never seen before, and in the same way that the Kikuyu were stirred up to become the Mau Mau, and the ANC driven to fire necklacing fury, our schools, our politicians and our media are at work encouraging, within the new arrivals and their British born offspring, a sense of grievance and a resentment for an imaginary past and non-existent crimes which we are supposed to have committed against them. At the same time, while our children are taught guilt, theirs are taught entitlement, a dream of Uhuru before which we are the only obstacle.

To be fair - to myself, and to everyone else out there trying to conceive - we have only been trying for 7 weeks, or two cycles ( the first of which, having come off the pill, i dont think i ovulated anyway ). So its not like we've been trying forever, or are even anywhere near thinking about fertility tests in the like.... its just that i so badly want a baby like RIGHT THIS VERY MINUTE and had my fingers crossed that it would all happen in an instant . ( You know, like it did last time, when i missed two days worth of the Pill and miraculously fell pregnant.) But it hasnt and i know, in my head, that it very rarely does happen like that.
Long story short: it was. And it’s worth sharing, but due to the way the days were structured, I think it probably makes more sense to describe it categorically rather than linearly. Also I only took like 4 photos, because I felt sort of weird pulling out my big camera during times of silent meditation and whatnot.

It is a high standard that we look to, then, in recognizing Bernard Weisberg as very much the thoughtful patriot, a citizen who is both willing to serve, and able to serve with distinction, in whatever post he is assigned. Indeed, such men, serving conscientiously wherever they chance to find themselves, assure us of the soundness of the dedication of this country to equality—since we can observe through them that the same talents may be needed, and are cheerfully made available, to do whatever has to be done in all proper efforts on behalf of the community, whether public or private, whether high or low. It is this willingness—the modest willingness of the best to serve wherever they are needed—which helps make things work here as well as they do.

What was I going to do with it all??? We gave it our best effort, but only managed to eat half the cake. Ironically, we ended up taking it over to Melissa's house, when we were in the neighborhood anyway, taking the dog to my mom's house so she could dogsit for us.

The freeing message of the gospel from legalism is that in Christ we are free from the law and its desire to enslave us to the double edged sword of legalism. We need to bask in the reality that Christ has freed us from the demands of the law for he has met them because we cannot. Our self-imposed legalism cannot help us fulfill the law. We were never intended to and God does not expect us to. Our attempts are displeasing to him and they diminish the law fulfilling work of Christ that has already been accomplished on the cross.

Is this our future? Britain’s security services will not be able to hold back Islamic terrorist attacks forever, and when the next one gets through I fully expect to see indigenous British hotheads take revenge by murdering a Muslim somewhere in Britain or by torching a Mosque. And so will start the long slide into civil war, tit for tat atrocities becoming progressively more vicious, before the entire country goes the way of Lebanon, or more recently Yugoslavia, which of course fractured along racial, tribal and religious lines.

Heading for coffee one might be tempted to seek out the actual first shop of Coffee Prince, as seen in the drama with the same name. I would strongly advice against it, having had an experience not to far from the one described here. Instead, look down the street to the other side of the road for Coffee Lab. Doesn't have the same connection to either drama or lovely indie music, but coffee is much better and your experience guaranteed to be better.

The forum started promptly at 7pm and the the speakers gave brief introductions then discussed their approach to Belgian beers and how they select them for brewing, retail and wholesale distribution. They explained how many of the monasteries care less about profits and more about how it much it is enjoyed by the general public, something I found to be very interesting. They also talked about how brave you have to be to open a brewery in Belgium. With over 1,000 different beers available already and in a country the size of Maryland, you have to be a bit nuts. There was a brief history lesson after that and then we got to drinking.
The second reason Waters made the demand for full disclosure is more troubling. There is no smoking gun proof that she did anything wrong. This writer received a copy of the eighty page report.

There are eighteen exhibits of memos, affidavits, testimony and interviews with Waters and the other principals involved.

It follows on directly from my work as a children’s book illustrator. I was already immersed in the children’s publishing industry and knew that I wanted to write picture book stories. But things just evolved in such a way that I began writing longer, complex stories for slightly older children than I had been illustrating for.
I’m sorry… but it is. Three hours and fourteen minutes. We’re not talking about The English Patient, a love story that spans years. We’re talking about a movie that lasts longer than the actual sinking of the ship. If the writing was good, or if the characters were super charismatic, I’d give it more leeway, but it isn’t. Don’t get me wrong… I don’t shy away from an epic. I love all three Lord of the Rings movies, and they’re all longer. Again, though… the justification for that is that the story spans months of time. It takes place in a hundred locations. The books are hundreds and hundreds of pages. What it always struck me is that Cameron was TRYING to make something big and long and epic. It was a show-off thing. It was also a lazy thing, because maybe a couple fewer loving shots of the boat (that look like matte paintings anyway) and maybe one or two fewer annoying scenes between Rose and Billy Zane… You may have yourself the start of a picture. Oh… and the framework scenes with Bill Paxton, at his absolute worst, talking to the old lying lady… terrible. I don’t care.

Consider Luke 12:19-20. “And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee; then whose shall those things be, which thou has provided?”

I had suspected for a while, that our modern way of life (go to school, find a job, work from 9 to 5, go home, watch sports, sleep for however many hours you can each night, and do it all again the next day) goes against human nature. But if you're in the middle of it all, with a husband (or wife) who works long hours, and children who go to school, you don't think about it. Quite frankly, you don't have time to think about it.

The Internet has proved to be such a great tool for impromptu, casual forums, in particular for religion and politics. Formerly taboo subjects for polite conversation, these twins have latched on to the fact that the Innertubes are often less than polite if not just plain insufferable - the speed of technology makes it harder and harder to hold on to good ideas and remain intellectually honest with out going all troll. In the midst of trying to be a better person, which at times seems like a nowhere-to-go-but-up proposition, like a raven I still look for the shiny objects to plunder and horde. Thankfully the times for needing to deliver the smackdown, meet my match, or duel to a draw are waning, and I'm relieved to see calm, measured, respectful and knowledgeable discussion increasing.
I really wanted to make a happy song, because the two we wrote before this one were kind of surly and grumpy. I decided that the song was to be called Happy Monday, inspired by the band Happy Mondays. It was the last song we wrote for the album, and it was actually written while we were mixing the other songs. The pace of the song is considerably slower than the rest on the album, and we’ve already talked about going in that direction regarding the next record.
When I started blogging, I didn’t really know what I was doing. I still don’t. But, along the way, I met other bloggers who I now consider friends. Sure, we don’t know each other, not really, but I know that I really enjoy reading their blogs. I’m quite a procrastinator, so chances are that I probably will never get around to following the rules of the award like I am supposed to, but know that I cherish the thought that these women, who both could outwrite me in a blogging duel HANDS DOWN, thought of me to nominate for this award. I am soo glad that I have met you guys. Thank you.

The journey is the best part of any story. This has been my philosophy forever. My best friend wants to kill me sometimes when I cheat and find out how a story ends, but the ending doesn’t matter to me. If someone told you Kelly, for example, got married you’d have some questions right? Like, who’s Kelly? Who did she marry? Why should I care? Now imagine this: someone tells you Kelly is a smart, sensitive, beautiful, overworked and underpaid employee of some big company and, after years of yearning for a boy she thought she lost years ago, she meets said boy and they rekindled their relationship and are now engaged. You’d be more likely to feel happy for Kelly after you knew her story than if you just found out she was married and knew nothing about her. The journey lets you know someone’s character. The journey is the biggest adventure life has to offer. There’s no point in rushing to the end when you know what’s going to happen.
Visiting The Hague, or living there as an expat? There are many (nearly) free so-called “lunch concerten” you can attend. The Stichting Kunstcentrum Kloosterkerk organises 30-minute concerts they call “pauzeconcert” starting at 12:45, twice monthly. The music performed tends to be chamber music, for which the small church is well suited. On leaving the church after each concert, the public is kindly asked to donate about 4 euros to ensure the concerts, which run from September to September each year, continue to be organised.

I was fortunate to win a lovely prize in a recent Creative Craft Challenge. The prize was a goody bag from Just Tracys Crafts. I don't think I've ever had a prize arrive so quickly, so thank you Tracy! A lovely goody bag it was too, introducing me to a couple of ranges that are new to me. My prize consisted of a Wild Rose Studio paper pack (Wintry Christmas), a Wild Rose Studio clear stamp and a pack of Kanban self adhesive snowflake stickers. The snowflakes are white in real life by the way - I have no idea why they have a pinky tone in the photo, especially as the other colours are true! I've used some of everything I received on this card. I chose three of the lovely co-ordinating papers to create the woven corner and added stickles to the dots. The lovely stamped image was coloured with promarkers and I used the same star dust stickles on her hat and frosted lace stickles created the snow. I then cut the image out with a nesties die. The sentiment is from a See D's set and was stamped with Brilliance pearlescent lavender ink. I thoroughly enjoyed making this and learned something along the way - colouring the image while trying to watch Australia v The All Blacks in a rugby world cup semi-final leads to the necessity to stamp another image and start again!!!! lol!

While it’s true that the bit that Pollan quotes focuses on the individual pigs, Pollan would like us to believe that the individual pigs are the sole concern of the Humane Society, but that seems doubtful if the Humane Society offered to help with a contraception plan. If the animal protectionists were concerned with the individual suffering, perhaps it was because they believed that the project’s ecological goals could be accomplished with less suffering.

Right after she was born, she was doing great. Her vitals were strong, her temperature was good and she was eating well. But throughout the day on Tuesday she was having a hard time maintaining a normal temperature, which is quite common for smaller babies. They put her under the lamps a few times and we tried doing skin to skin for most of the day, but her temp was dropping into unsafe regions, so the docs deemed it best that she be put into an incubator in the NICU until she was able to maintain it on her own. When they came in to get her and take her down there, let me tell you, I was not a pretty site. I was extremely emotional as they rolled her away into the cold, dark unknown. OK, that may be a bit dramatic (especially because they were actually rolling her away to be put into the warm, cozy incubator), but when the nurses came to get her, that's exactly how it felt to this hormonal, postpartum mama . I was still under pretty tedious observation for my blood pressure because it was still very high, so I had to wait for them to take my vitals and give me the green light to be able to get up and go be with her. It felt very strange to be in one area of the hospital knowing that your baby was in another area, but once I was able to go and see her and be with her, then I think we adjusted to the change as best as we could.
I used to teach English, and I read all the time, so I have a big vocabulary. I don't dumb down what I say to my preschool-aged son, and neither does his father.

But just what IS the American Vaudeville Theatre, you may well ask? When I started the enterprise I was very good with the branding, but in the years since I started my book No Applause, I got lazy about branding everything “AVT” and No Applause became the essential brand even in performance. I look at it this way: essentially, the American Vaudeville Theatre is like the Plastic Ono Band– it’s a name for whoever’s in the room with me at the time.

Some women are 'natural' mothers. They are fulfilled by time with their children and all aspects of their role. They can do copious amounts of floor-time, and usually experience empty-nest syndrome. They don't concern themselves much with their own needs. They tend to form friendships almost exclusively with other mothers and enjoy talking about their children.

Let's start with "engagement." Engagement -- like "branding" and "conversation" -- is one of those dreadful cliches that means whatever some hustler decides it means. Social media jargonistas throw it around like awards at an advertising conference. They start from the position that social media participation is de facto evidence of brand engagement.
I made the mistake of starting with the 8:00 pace group since it was impossible to push against the crowd at that point, but I kept my own pace and just let them pass me.

Then last week, he wandered into the school room and found a crayon. He bent down to do his scribble on the floor thing that he does and I caught him before he got there. Then I thought, why not give him some paper and see what he does. He sat on the floor and made lines on the paper for over 20 minutes. That might not sound crazy to you, but he's a 17 month old boy. He doesn't do anything for 20 minutes solid. This morning, he was wandering around the house--read looking for something to dump out or destroy ;)--and I thought, "let's give it a try again." So, I got him a piece of paper and some crayons and he went to town. He was SO happy. He sat contentedly for 25 minutes and only stopped because it was naptime. Here's a sampling of the artist at work:
The zoo sports all the usual smaller suspects: kangaroos, reptiles, birds, primates, rodents, meercats etc but it is the indoor heated environment (from which the Zoo derives its name) that is truly unique. It is a self-contained tropical environment housing extremely exotic fauna and flora, the most dazzling of which is the dozens of species of butterfly, which are free to fly, eat and procreate as they would in their natural environment.

We know from Church History that St. James was the Bishop of Jerusalem and as Acts 21:15-25 describes, he was concerned for Jewish Christians in Jerusalem who felt their ancient customs threatened by the great number of Gentile converts. This background explains why St. James made the later remarks at the council and asked Gentiles to respect certain Jewish practices.

Isn’t that nice. I know this hasn’t been about older books but you know – sometimes you just have to swank a bit, as we used to say derisively when I was at school. “Stop swanking!” – well, as the Bible might have said: There is a time to swank and a time to refrain from swanking – this is definitely one of the former.

A feature in the conduct of Messrs. Allsopp & Sons' business is the consideration shown to the employees, who, without counting clerks and the office staff, number 1,600. For their benefit the firm maintains a cricket ground, bowling green, a sick and funeral club, and a library managed by a scripture reader, who also visits the men and their families. Here and there about the breweries and maltings may be seen tottering old men, who seem out of place among so much life and bustle. These are the pensioners, who work as much or as little as they like. We believe that Messrs. AIlsopp and Sons rank third among the brewing firms of the United Kingdom, and the extent of their business may be inferred from the simple fact that they have an annual expenditure of £1,400 to £1,500 in postage stamps alone. In the busy periods of the year upwards of 20,000 casks pass weekly through their racking rooms. It would be presumption to attempt to criticise the malt liquor produced by this firm or, indeed, that of any of our leading brewers."

I believe I have a writing successor, or at least a sidekick. My daughter has always had an affinity for not only drawing, but elaborate storytelling as well. Like most nine year olds she has a ridiculously active imagination and vision for what she wants to tell. However, she's not always entirely sure how best to convey it, and so she asks me how best to begin or end it. Being a staunch creative independent shy away from answering. I prefer to have her say what she wants, and then later refine it with grammatical polishing and such. She's quite an artist as well, drawing much inspiration from the same catalysts as me. Often, she'll be sparked by a drawing and be compelled to write something, or vice versa. She possesses such a creative knack, virtually world building much in the same way that I do. She even shares similar tastes in reading: scary stories, science-fiction, comedy, and mystery. I am proudly impressed with her.

Being fly translates into any language. It doesn't matter if you rock an edgy salwar kameez in Mumbai or a hot samba skirt in Sao Paulo, fly is fly. And right now I'm fly in Korean because my current fave t-shirt showcases a cool chick with a Korean phrase, above. Besides the vivid cornflower blue hue and the beautifully hand drawn illustration, what really sold me on this tee was the meaning of that phrase. It says, "everyone's entitled to my opinion"! I had to have it. But Chicago designer Anna Hovet creates a tempting slew of culturally clever, signature tees that had me dizzy with the possibilities. I seriously considered snatching up all of these $30 t-shirts.

I disagree with her ideas about men, women, the workplace, France, French men and the French in general. And this one was no different. I read the article wih mild irritation. Figured there'd be a few nasty comments. I can see her point, although she exaggerated it beyond belief - some women are jealous of more attractive women. It was ever thus. Some. Not all.
The Braves’ running mates in the division are where we run into the slightly irrational excitement that I described way back at the beginning of this essay. Sure the Nationals are exciting and young. A full season of Strasburg could prove to be something special, and after years of futility, this franchise is finally starting to emerge from the post-Expos hangover. But that youth movement also carries with it a load of questions. Can Gio Gonzalez sake the control problems that dogged him in Oakland? How will Michael Morse’s season-opening DL stint affect his continued growth? If mega-prospect Bryce Harper spends significant time with the big club, will he blossom or just annoy people with a mouth that seems to match his prodigious talents? And will veteran Jayson Worth regain any of his former stroke, or will his signing go down as one of the last bum moves for this star-crossed franchise (assuming that the seemingly prescient locking up of Ryan Zimmerman pays off as expected)? Yep, a load of questions translates into continued improvement, but this club is still a year away from making a run at

The second technique described by Foucault is normalizing judgment (p. 177). Expectations of behaviour were broken down into the minutest details such as being late, talking when not appropriate, incorrect posture, lack of cleanliness, and many others. When students, workers or soldiers didn’t conform to the norm, they were punished but not through corporal punishment, rather through psychological manipulations such as humiliation, ignoring, demoting, or withdrawal of privileges (p. 178). Interestingly, the hierarchical system of rank served to both punish and reward. By demonstrating the skills of the established norm, one could be promoted to a higher rank; however, punishment could be descending rank when behaviours are not those expected and demanded (p. 181).
I'll tell you what I told Patti Page in person. What makes Patti Page the greatest, is what makes Muhammad Ali the greatest: versatility.

This site was created as a campaign to bring this serious issue and threat to everyone’s attention. They have done a great job spreading awareness of how serious this issue is.

Dr. Tyson likes education. Just ask him. He’ll tell you just how important curiosity is, and that it’s missing in today’s education system. He’ll tell you that teachers should be igniting a fire within us. Even though I don’t know him, I think that Dr. Tyson would say that finding something you love, something you’re willing to work for, is so important.
The last session of the LGfL conference was an update about the LGfL 2.0 migration. Basically, it’s a big job and it’s taking longer than we expected but will result in a faster, more secure and more resilient broadband connection for schools. Yay! One guy even tried enlivening his presentation by including Disney quotes. Fair dos.

From what we can see, it cannot becontrolled by the driver, so the duct may not be trying to do the same thing as the McLaren. Either the team rely on a a puely aerodynamic way to control the rear wing stalling, such as the duct choking at high speed and cutting off the flow the slot. Or the duct merely adds mass flow to the exisiting blown slot (raced in Bahrain) to allow the wing to be run even steeper and create yet more downforce. We will need mor eimages to be sure what Sauber are trying here.
18. Music: I would love it if I could afford to send each of my kids for Suzuki violin lessons from the time they are four years old, but I can't. Many of us can't. When money is an issue, you really have to think whether those violin lessons outweigh the comfort of remaining debt free, or of having extra for a family trip once a year, or for mom to get help in the house once a week. That doesn't mean that music is not important. It just means that we have to find alternative ways to acquire the knowelge and also that we trust in God to provide when there is a REAL talent that needs to be developed. I don't know for sure, but I doubt David's dad paid for him to have harp lessons as a kid. He probably gleaned knowlege from watching others play, or from hours sitting with his flocks just picking out tunes. I am sure there was someone there to help when the time was right, because the Lord does provide when He has something He wants you to do.
Anyway, enjoy a smoke if that’s what floats your boat, or a quiet ale or a noisy lager or whatever it is that you need to do to live, thrive and survive and remember the words of the twentieth century’s greatest thinkers – Bill & Ted; "Be Excellent to Each other!"
In order to escape the last plague in Egypt, God’s people were to apply the blood of a sacrificial lamb on their doorposts and lintel, so that when the angel saw the blood, he would ‘pass over’ their house (Ex. 12:13). This final plague was God’s decisive stroke against the false gods that held God’s people in bondage, and resulted in their deliverance from slavery and release into freedom.

Brian grins up at me and yells, “Ok!” Then he throws me down and away from him as hard as he can. I slam into the floor, my head striking a seat leg, and lie there stunned. Before I can get up the bus pulls up at Brian’s house. He laughs as he steps over me on his way out the door. The bus driver shakes her head, but doesn’t comment.

Another enormous installation in Grant Park are the "Agora" sculptures by Polish artist Magdelena Abakanowicz. Agora references outdoor, or urban, meeting places. The 9' tall headless and armless pieces appear to mill about and the viewer is encouraged to walk in and around the installation. They were impressive enough from the bus, but my traveling companion Rob had walked through them earlier in the week and said they were really amazing up close and personal.

South America has loads of churches. Some of them are awe-inspiring like the one in Cusco, which has a great painting of the last supper with a roast guinea pig in the centre of the table. Others are bare brick buildings that have probably been pillaged of all their valuable objects over time. Most are relics of the colonial days when the Spanish and Portuguese came and forced their religion on the indigenous people, so there is usually some kind of torrid history.
Every time I go back to my home town I make a "pit stop" at a particular bakery where I can find the most amazing French Macarons (macaroons) and stunning desserts. I have photographed their window on many occasions as they always offer different choices and was just waiting for the opportunity to scrap those pics. When I first saw the Sweet Nothings collection from Kaisercraft I knew that opportunity had arrived! I love this collection!
At another recent bachelorette party that took place in Palm Springs, the hosting ladies ordered totes for all of the guests! It was perfect for the day spent relaxing by the pool and included the names of all those celebrating with the bride-to-be. The photo used was a picture of the bride catching the bouquet at a wedding last year...the same wedding where her fiance caught the garter...I guess it was meant to be!
As I listened to the shofar blowing, I thought of my dad in Gan Eden (I have absolutely no doubt in the world that he's way up there!) and thought of past services. I realized that it isn't so much about the praying that I was remembering, but rather what went on after shul.

Its purpose will be to purchase foreclosed homes from the institutional owners (see banks) and…
When I got up this morning, all set to write this, I had a moment when I realized how appropriate this subject is for today. I picked it in February, but it's pertinent because I didn't think I need to write 500 words, or I need to get some more going in my WIP because it didn't have the immediate, predetermined, people are going to know if I don't deadline.

I spent the first couple of weeks of her miraculous life giving more thought to baby number two than I should have. It took me several months longer than I'd care to admit to move out of the mindset of infertility, to stop feeling like I'd been robbed of normal things like everyone else who could freely plan and produce children at their desire. I wasted many precious moments looking ahead at what the future held-still giving infertility and the fear it brought full control-instead of looking down into arms now full, that used to be so empty.

Another thing with clicker training is the more you reward in the beginning, the stronger and faster the behavior gets ingrained. I decided we would do lots of little leg yields so he would know what I wanted next time. Now, I have learned that getting that first step or two in anything with Cole is the most important. Once you get those, the rest comes easy. There was no reason to push beyond his initial attempt. I just kept rewarding his little attempts.

I think I'd like to revise this. How about a corporate business tax on salaries and bonuses (including stock or stock options) in excess of say, $500,000 a year. - Say a 1000% tax, be kind of hard to sell that $10,000,000 bonus to the shareholders wouldn't it :). If you own the company, or it's a limited partnership, no extra tax - because it's YOUR company, not the shareholders. (yeah that's my anti corporate economy thing showing itself - but I really do think the thing that ruins the free market is government intervention and creating a legal fiction like the corporation is definitely interference.)
You can buy beer from their website, and I see they may even be bottling some of their whisky aged stout; Far Out Stout. I really hope they can start to bottle the whole range of beers, they would be an awesome addition to the Beer Ritz shelves. I'd recommend this brewery to anyone. If you see it at the pumps, grab it fast because it's simply delicious. I just hope it will come around more often than not at Arcadia. I just get the feeling that this brewery's going places fast.

To me, that sounds a bit crazy. I know there are couples in this world who can work their romantic partnership as well as their business partnership, but it doesn’t sound like fun to me to be spending so much time together that is focused on work. I believe that I would appreciate dating someone who provides a respite from work. I would enjoy hearing about my significant other’s day at work and telling him about mine. And I could have a legitimate reason to not care about the details of his day. I’m guessing he would appreciate the same about my day.

Many of us could acknowledge, that this principle of giving place to the less honorable (in the church) has been strangely absent from decision-making within church bodies and congregations. It is apparent to me, that if our religious communities are going to express a radical hospitality, harmony and peace, energy and authenticity in the fullest measure possible, this Pauline mindset as expressed in I Corinthians 12 and 13 needs our careful attention. What do you think?
ADR asked if this is what he is getting, the fans booing him. That’s fine, he can take it, but what he can’t take is being disrespected. Last week, John Cena gave him an AA, and we all laughed at him. This is the same man who hurt Rey Mysterio, put him out of action, he is the man who forced Edge to retire, and he is the man who will teach John Cena a lesson or two at Night of Champions. His name is Alberto Del Rio, and he is the undisputed WWE Champion, and he is the greatest of the great.

5. Spend Time to Soak in the Wonder: David Rolloff, a professor or recreation, parks, and tourism said, “Yosemite is a very emotional place. It’s a high church of nature, in a lot of ways, and I think some people are so enthralled they don’t absorb what’s around them.” So make sure to really look around you. Take photographs and take a moment to breath the fresh air and listen to the sounds nature has to offer.

For the men out there, I hope you follow along as I continue to write about what it means to be a better man. For women, this will be informative and helpful to you, too, because there are so many misconceptions in our society about men. Men are thought of as anything from expendable, faceless cogs in the machine, to vile and perverted creatures, the source of society’s problems, to knights in shining armor that can save us from anything.

The Center for Disaster Research and Education at Millersville University sponsors a virtual seminar series for the University and larger community. The Center houses a minor program in Environmental Hazards and Emergency Management and a master’s program in Emergency Management. The seminars are mainly for the students and faculty in these programs in addition to the larger University community. The sessions are live sessions online which then are later made available as podcasts.

Perhaps you’re overwhelmed with sadness today. It may be the weight of a difficult ministry; the worry of a hard marriage; the sorrow of a struggling child; the care of an aging parent; other troubles that come with life. “Surely,” you say, “God would not have me walk this way. There must be another, easier path for me to travel.”

I leave the skins on my apples because I like skins, but if you want to peal, that is fine too. Basically, fine chop your apples into small pieces, then in a medium bowl mix the apple pieces with your lemon juice, water, sweetener and flour and cinnamon. You make a nice coating of spice and flour over all of your apples. Mix well to make sure it is evenly coated. Let sit while you pull the crust from the oven and let cool just a bit. Then, when the crust is par-baked and slightly cooled, pour the apple filling over the crust in the 9x13 pan.

Scream was by far one of the most interesting and talented bands to come out of the Dischord scene. Which is saying a lot due to their revolutionary acts. The Stahl brothers have continued to write and put out continous work through various other projects as well as Wool, who followed the break up of Scream. Scream reunited and have been back for a bit now. Be sure to catch them when they hit your town and see how true masters of the old school show you young bastards how it's meant to be done.

I am speaking from the heart here. I am not being critical or judgmental. I am saying this because I love this person. I want to see them happy, to be able to face a new day with a sense of anticipation instead of an "Ugh. Another day to get thru" attitude. I want to have it settled in my heart that when I'm gone this person is at a place in life where they're happy. That would ease a tremendous amount of my fretfulness.
I like to be organised (well in a fashion), so my hubby, John has made a storage unit for my aquamarkers, promarkers and spectrum noirs. I am sooooo pleased with it, and finding the colours I need is so easy. I even have a few spare holes for if any more colours come out.

Even after all that, they have not been able to suppress this movement. They have arrested 11 of us including 5 women under unethical and false pretexts. And still they could not kill our movement. We continue our movement in demand of proper rehabilitation of all dwellers of Nonadanga, in demand of unconditional release of all agitators. Today this struggle is not only for the Majdoor Palli and Shramik Colony of Nonadanga; today this struggle is for all slum dwellers, for the right to shelter. We plead to you, as a slum dweller, as a resident of this area, join us in this struggle. Be on our side as a defendant of the basic rights. We need all your love, help and support. Let Nonadanga be the new name for our struggle. Let there be hope for the defendants.

John Buscema has been called one of the finest comic artists who ever put pen to paper. His work for Marvel Comics on The Avengers, Thor, The Fantastic Four, and Silver Surfer are all classics, highly regarded by fans from around the world. The same is true for his definitive rendition of Conan the Barbarian – Buscema breathed life into Robert E. Howard’s legendary creation in a manner that has rarely been rivaled. IDW is proud to announce the first American publication of John Buscema: Comics & Drawings, a special edition of the fine art catalog created for the most extensive exhibition of Buscema’s art ever staged. Weighing in at nearly 300-pages, this gorgeous hardcover book is a dream come true for fans of the visual mastery of John Buscema, an artist who’s ilk we are unlikely to see again.
On a much lower note, a dear friend of ours has been in the hospital all this week with complications from Myasthenia gravis and has been very sick.

Thoughts and prayers and good juju are most certainly appreciated as we hope for a speed recovery.
Let me explain a trickle around effect that conservatives are either mind-numbingly blind to or just blissfully ignorant of. If people no work, they no make money. If people no make money, they no can spend money. Do I really need to explain to you what drives the “free” market? Sure, get rid of that guy making your disks. Now Mr. and Mrs. Corner Store where that guy lives are making less money and consequently little Johnny Corner Store, along with little Freddy Diskmaker, have less money to spend on their favorite hobby, gaming. I won’t even go into how much more expensive a hard drive for a gaming console is over one for a computer. And when these companies save themselves money in this way do they pass those savings on to you? Do they go and spend money at the corner store? F– no. They give themselves exuberant raises and buy a Lamborghini.

We know just by observing the direction daily drastic events are heading, things are going to get worse. Again, adjusting your program in support of your loved ones is priority. Some of us do it naturally as we've always done and some of us will need to force the effort. If you should find yourself feeling like rusty brillo, short and abrasive, swallow your pride.

I would only add that revolution first begins with self-awareness.
I know I haven't updated my teaching blog in a while, but things got so busy this semester and it was all I could do to get a few hours of sleep each night, plus keep two other blogs updated! I interned in a kindergarten class this semester at a school in my mountain town. If you have been reading my blog for a while you would remember my fear of being in a kindergarten class. I have never thought I was would want to teach kindergarten and can safely say that I would still rather teach upper elementary.

There is one particular friend of Eldest, Youngest and their mates though, who seems to want to stir things up every time he posts something. Apart from the fact that he is constantly disparaging about the place he left, he gives the impression of sneering at everything and anything that others do or say. Occasionally some of the more outspoken contributors will have a go back at him and he invariably replies with apologies that his remarks were taken out of context and heartfelt regrets. A couple of days later he's back again with a comment here, a veiled put down there. I have a feeling if he still lived in these parts he would no longer be part of the gang.
As soon as I knew Anna was coming into the world I was excited to meet her. I still think I got a good deal with being able to be a stay home dad. Just because I enjoyed my single life does not mean I would not be a good parent. Just like I don’t have to like all children to love my own.

As I have written before, seafood is often a very healthy choice. Fish contains Omega-3s, polyunsaturated fats, which have been proven to significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular death. In fact, this is the only dietary factor where there is clear proof that it can reduce cardio-related deaths. The health benefits of seafood are highlighted by a number of exhibitors, providing additional reasons why you should be partaking of more seafood and eating less red meat.

Blue colors your world with emotion. You seldom jump right in, preferring to stand back and watch people and situations closely. Blue people are calm, but can also spiral into sadness. With so much emotion, tears of happiness, sadness, anger, or frustration are quite common.

For a country with such a strong track record in both kinds of music (punk and hard rock), Australian collisions of the genres were surprisingly rare. Yes, we have our proto-punkers; our pub, glam, and hard rockers who jumped ship; and our teen grillfat so amateurish as to achieve a punky edge. That's not what we mean. We're talking about wilful, artful combinations of punk and hard rock conventions, hybrids that have equal footing in both camps. Songs that can hold their own when viewed through the lens of either tradition. Though the opening quote was penned for Cleveland's Strychnine, it applies equally to anomalous Sydney Westies Invader, and their standing among the early Australian punkers. (It's just a happy accident that both play the Blame game).

I think that’s all there is to report. I hadn’t actually expected to be making this post until tomorrow, but somehow I thought I had more ending to write than it turned out. Maybe that’s part of why I’m not happy with the ending, the feeling that it’s missing something. Oh well, that’s something I can mull while I’m NOT editing that beast, and then work out when it’s time to tackle the task. In the meantime, I’m off to give my brain a much needed, deserved break. I will say, though, the thrill of writing The End still hasn’t gotten old, even though I’ve done it 3 times now in fairly rapid succession. I doubt it ever will, though.

Well one thing that's for certain is that I was getting less bendy! And this new-found lack of bendiness has caused me to struggle a bit when it came to tying my shoes. Fortunately my husband was around most of the time to help me out with this little task, that I never in my life thought would be a task...other than when I first learned as a child. One day they came untied three times in that one day, because my sideways bendy tying method never made for a really good tight knot. O'well! That is why it's always nice to have a pair of slip-ons nearby.
Sadly, several members of the guild were unable to attend the dinner meeting. I’m hoping they’ll email their choices so I can include them, if not in the upcoming post, at least on an addendum.
13. met relatives here and consumed delicious Vietnamese food (*drools*) I love being Asian and having a big family. I feel bad for my future kids. It was also interesting to see how they lived here/acculturated as to compared to Asians in the U.S. The kids are basically Danish, just how I’m basically American. It’s interesting to observe what parts of the Vietnamese culture remains and what doesn’t. For example, I didn’t blatantly realized that Vietnamese people are friendly and welcoming until my relative told me because Danes keep to themselves, so they don’t give off that impression. That must be a harder adjustment. She also said there weren’t any Asian grocery stores until a few years after she had moved there. I think she’s been there since 1988.

David Matthews was born on March 4, 1942, in Sonora, Kentucky, but grew up in several different places in Kentucky, mostly in and around Louisville. As a child, he started playing trumpet and developed an interest in jazz during his teens. He attended The College Conservatory of Music, which is now part of the University of Cincinnati, and received a Bachelor's degree in composition.

It has been one crazy month. After two weeks in the hospital on bed rest, my body decided that it could no longer be pregnant. Katherine Grace made her appearance on July 9th at 1:49 pm via emergency C-section, weighing in at 5 lbs 10 oz and 18.5 inches long. She was perfectly healthy and was able to stay with me in my room after the first harrowing night that I had. I was not perfectly healthy but, I am now.

“I’m on my way to see a friend.”
Who is better than a doctor to cure this problem? Who? Think, damn you, think! Of course! My little brother, Mike, aka "Beach Justice." No, he is not a doctor, but he did graduate from SUNY Fredonia in 2002 or so and I remembered he had had a similar condition at one time. So I called him on my cellular wireless telephone. It was about 9AM and Mike is accustomed to waking up at ohhh about noon, so I wasn't expecting him to answer. The phone rang 4 or 5 times before I heard the glorious click and timbre of my brother's surprisingly alert voice answering his phone. I asked him to help me. "Please, brother, please!" He replied, "Calm down, my friend, let me walk you through it." In his most scholarly and medicinal voice, Mike gave me the clinical explanation. I've had a bad allergic reaction to some beer. Something about the wheat or the way they process it. Have I had this beer before? No. Did you drink at all last night? Yes, yes! Well there's your answer. Take some allergy medication and give it till day's end. Oh, thank you brother, thank you! TT, the absoulute peach that she is, drove to the store and got me some Benadryl. Though they didn't exactly perform open-heart surgery on me, Mike and TT saved my life.
I'm not addicted, but it's a habit which is starting to make me unhappy, and therefore one that needs breaking. Besides anything else, I take a lot of medication already for my Behcets disease – Methotrexate (an anti-cancer drug,) Sulphasalazine, (an anti-rheumatic,) Celecoxib, painkillers (sometimes morphine based.) I won’t bore you with them all, but you can see the amount of toxins my system has to cope with. I really shouldn’t punish my body by adding more.

If you don’t put the hours in, you won’t be able to do the routines. Gymnastics is a tough sport. One wrong move and you can get an injury that can take you out for months, if not years. In order to work up to the more complicated moves you need to spend time in the gym, nailing down each move before you try the next. In this particular case, (as in most other cases) practice does make perfect. If you don’t spend the time doing the work, you won’t ever improve.

There is, however, another aspect to this. Many people do not actually want to know the unvarnished truth: they don’t want to “look a gift horse in the mouth” in case the spell is broken. They don’t want to know that something hideous is lurking behind the walls or that the structure is entirely devoid of foundations. They fall in love with their idea of it, and in their mind’s eye they already see it beautified and envisage their future life within. Few who commit to buying seem prepared to give up the dream of owning outright a property in the sun.

The aim of the game is to spend Good points to put Bad points on your opponent. You agree a starting amount, the book suggests 20 to start with and an average game of around 40 but you could go all the way up to 150 but that is silly. Especially as you need to cause that amount of Bad to your opponent to win.

So, how does the CIO prioritize? Where does he/she start? My contention is that the CIO knows best! Starting with the initiative that is most critical in his/her judgement, the CIO must commence the virtuous cycle of positive business impact. Like any business initiative, it is of course critical that the SmartIT initiatives receive management commitment, specialist expertise and the operational support required to deliver on the objectives.

If you are like me, you sometimes wake up in the middle of the night feeling like you have to pee. You have two options when this happens. You can get up and go to the bathroom or you can try to ignore the urge and fall back to sleep. But one thing is for sure, even if you somehow manage the second option, the need doesn't go away. In fact, when you wake up again, your need will probably be even stronger.

It is just the way my shirt is laying do to the angle of my arm. This gun does not print(the outline of the gun or weapon seen through clothing) with this loose shirt. I love this shirt because even as I move throughout my day lifting and bending, it does not come up over the gun and it completely covers the clips of the holster.

An entire dissertation could be written about the music industry during the late sixties, but to summarise it briefly, it’s hard to understate just how chaotic and confused a lot of the major labels were at this time. A great many of the bands of the era freely admit they were often signed because the executives had little concept of which way the wind was blowing from one hour to the next. Having only just acclimatized themselves to the idea that “groups with guitars” were most definitely not “on their way out” in 1962, by late 1966 they suddenly had to get used to the fact that pop and rock music could include both music hall humour and pretentions towards high art as well. When you threw mind-expanding drugs into the mix, it was no wonder that the silver haired managers at Decca freely admitted to one artist that “if you throw enough mud at the wall, some of it will stick”. An interesting A&R policy which reveals more confusion than any sort of marketing-lead savvy.
We need to discuss these facts at every opportunity. We need to explode the misconception that Israel is an outpost of western colonialism and tell the truth of how Jews are indigenous to the region and have suffered since the rise of Arab nationalism and Islamism.

Getting Rid of Fatigue
Paul begins and ends his list with the most obvious expressions of the sinful nature. The list is weighted, however, in the direction of the major problem of divisions caused by ambitious, angry people. Their preoccupation with keeping the law may have blinded them to their own sinful nature. Intent on establishing a secure place for themselves in the kingdom of God, they were actually destroying the people of God. Paul gives them a very severe warning: I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God (v. 21). Those who are so concerned to secure their own place that they deny any place for others will lose their own place in the end.

Your scriptures, your journal, and some clothes to keep you warm.

On to my project... I am having a blast distressing left and right. Pretty soon my whole house will be distressed! More on distressing tomorrow. For now, let me just tell you about my project. After distressing the tag with my distress inks, I decided on using a stamp I haven't inked up before. I got this stamp last year but never used it till now. It's a wood stamp I got from Poppy Stamps- which I think is affiliated with Memory Box. On the wood, it says "friendship", so I assumed it would also say that on the rubber. After I stamped it, I wondered what happened to the "friendship"... I guess it was just the kanji cause "friendship" never showed up! It's ok, I like it still, but thought that now I needed to explain it to you! I like that you can see the distress inks underneath the kanji letters too. Embossed it with black Zing embossing powder so that it stood out.
In all types of literature, secular and sacred, ancillary features of a narrative are often used to make a point loosely related to the main thrust(s) of the story. The presence of secondary or tertiary themes need not detain the exegete to the same degree as the story’s plotline, character development, and recurring motifs. As an example from English literature, no one familiar with James Joyce’s Ulysses would assume that bar patrons in the town of Dublin constitute a major area of interest for the story. The bar patrons, along with the other residents of Dublin, help to create a realistic picture of the physical setting in which the story takes place. To spend too much time focusing on these ancillary elements of the story would be to badly misread Joyce’s intent. Joyce is concerned to a much greater degree with issues like sexual desire, anti-semitism, and death. The authenticity of the Dublin scenery merely serves as a backdrop to the story.
How do we draw this line? I believe a lot of it has to do with motivation. Are we mad because somebody hurt us or disrespected us? Chances are, that’s vengeance. On the other hand, are we striving for justice for others, or devoting ourselves to a just cause? Chances are, that’s seeking justice.
Some analysts even assume, that a part of the political leadership did not even believe in witches, but merely exploited the superstitions of the population. (Minnaar 1998:185) The mass killings of elderly, mostly impoverished men and women would therefore be nothing but a cynically chosen instrument to achieve completely different political goals.

Before I get into the rest of the hospital drama, I should probably tell you that I am not normal. Okay yeah, that's a given. What I mean is that I don't react normally to man-made chemical pharmaceuticals. And my reaction is not consistent. Some things way over react, some just have other than normal reactions, and some things considered quite potent do not react on me at all. I don't seem to have that problem with natural drugs, and my preference is to self medicate with weeds, teas, and sometimes alcohol for the most part.

There's good music on Monday night at Salon Canning. Sylvia often finds great versions of songs you know well, by orquestas you can't place. You think: ah! I know Troilo's version of this – but who is this playing it? She always plays a great tanda of Carabelli too, and tops it all off with an extraordinary range of cortinas. Inevitably Lady Day, but Amy Winehouse too, and the widest possible range of rock, and even flamenco, all wonderful and usually unknown stuff, unknown to me and probably to a great many other people too I'm sure, and carefully fitted into the flow of tango. Makes a change from the run-of-the-mill cortinas most DJs play. Interesting what can happen when someone gives the cortinas some attention, rather than treating them as a fill-in between tandas.
The banking system isn’t corrupt, there are corrupt INDIVIDUALS in the banking system; just like there are corrupt individuals in countless other systems including government, religious organizations, educational institutions, charities, etc. You can’t blame a crisis caused by unethical behavior on an entire system, because just as there were predatory lenders who knew customers were potentially high risk for loan defaults, there are some ‘victims’ of this economic downfall who knew they bought more house than they could afford, who knew that they didn’t have true job ‘security’ but gambled with the odds anyway, who claimed to earn more than they actually had (and eventually they had more month than money). So unethical decisions from individuals caused our country to suffer these past few years.
The book is all about different moods and the message of the book is to be happy hippo--not an angry duck! It's funny because even though it's a kids book, I actually took something away from it. This situation I'm in seems impossible sometimes, but it's really important that I act like a hippo and not a duck. I can't change what's happened and honestly I'd rather do this than have my girls in the NIQU, so I really have to try to maintain a positive outlook--even when I'm homesick and missing my husband more than anything.

Besides the crispy skin, the meat is tender and juicy, even the chicken breast tastes good, soft and moist. This is mainly due to the ingredients used. The salt and corn starch will lock in the moisture as the chicken roasts. It is certainly a no-frills, no-fail and yet delicious meal that I would go back again and again. I am not so concerned about the fat, as most of the fat from the chicken melts and drips away during roasting. I am always amazed by the amount of oil that is collected in the roasting pan. It makes me think that a roast chicken is a much healthier choice than deep fried ones. Of course, the pan juice is best used to make a flavourful sauce out of it, but I have given up on it as I was too zealous trying to spoon off every single drop of fat that I was left with not much of juice to work with, lolz.
Nellu and I hadn’t done much exploring on our first time through, spending most of the day finding food and catching up on some much needed internet time to set up our accommodations in Nairobi.

We have no room to carry anything else in our bags and no money to spend on things that we don’t absolutely need. There’s nothing like spending months on the road to drive a wedge between you and your inner consumer. So we browse.

But Margaret and I don't like jigsaw puzzles, and most of our games are too hard or too sad to play with 3 players.

Although the whole Islamic world is target of Indo-Israeli plot, yet the same has intensified in case of Pakistan and Iran. It is due to the fact that Pakistan is a declared atomic country, while Iran is determined to continue its nuclear programme. In this regard, US-led some countries, especially India have been sabotaging Pak-Iranian ties covertly, while sectarian unrest is also part of their game. Notably, Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and a Sunni militant group Jundollah (God’s soldiers) which get arms from RAW and CIA are responsible for many sectarian assaults on Sunnis and Shias. In the past few years, their militants with the cooperation of foreign agents also kidnapped and killed Iranian nationals in Pakistan. In this respect, on October 18, 2009, a suicide attack had killed several officers in the Iranian Sistan-Baluchistan. On December 15, 2010, two suicide bombers blew themselves up near a mosque in Iran, killing 39 people. Jundullah claimed responsibility for these incidents. Regarding all these attacks, Tehran had directly accused CIA for funding of that type of terrorist attacks, while diverting the attention of Iran towards Islamabad through secret propaganda.

This resonated with me because it emphasizes how you must stay true to your values over time. For many of you who are just starting your career, I hope you can use this as a guideline. For the rest who are mid-career, it’s never too late to make a change.
Could that be why I haven’t achieved what I feel I’d like to in life? I mean, I know that the ADHD doesn’t help matters much, but if I thought a little more positively, maybe some things would start coming true? Hard work helps, but can I believe enough to help the hard work bring my dreams to fruition?
The rains fall endlessly and the streets are flooded. I see these women trudge through the mud to make it to the Gurudwara to fulfill their obligation of selfless service. They will prepare the meal for close to 100 people. Some are young but most are old, grandmothers. Their bodies are hardened with the burden of their many children and the tough work of each woman in this village. They carry the hardships of their families gracefully, bearing the pains their children suffer and the maladies their husbands bring home. They are responsible for holding the family together in an environment that is slowly eroding their sense of identity.

Unlike the Blue Men, I’m captivated. They will without doubt be making an appearance in a future book - thank you, Lucy - because I’m sure they’re well known both to my kelpies and to my Selkyr.

The terms of 'post-authenticity' or 'inauthenticity' are misleading labels for the change in sensibility and attitudes implying a more reflexive attitude to authenticity. They lead the focus from important elements of this change, not least the weakened fundament of the American-English hegemony in popular music. For decades the insistence on rock authenticity was coupled with an understanding of culture as national in constructing centre-periphery relations in the rock world. Urban American could fake rural accents and Mick Jagger could fake cockney, but foreign accents could not be accepted as authentic. Singing in English called for mockery in the home countries and a low place in the international hierarchy.
I’d argue that this applies to your motivation to blogging as well. To be sure, you can start a blog with the intention of making it a revenue stream, but then it’s a job. That’s OK, but it’s different from just blogging for the sheer love of communication and shared ideas.
Ware became “obsessed” with the footage of the incident, playing it repeatedly, said John Martinkus, a journalism teacher at the University of Tasmania and a friend of Ware’s.

This was the sole issue of a proposed pulp magazine series built around the exploits of an extremely evil arch-villain (and, with a few name changes and such, it was also issued as a pulp called The Scorpion). It's a short, rushed-feeling, amazingly gory and gruesome work with writing that's sometimes almost too sloppy to keep the story on track, but which also gets so purple-prosey that it becomes almost poetic. People all over the city are developing strange skin cancers and deformations that turn them into crazed monsters who crave human blood. A kindly doctor who leads triple life (rich layabout Jeffery Fairchild/ compassionate charity-case-tending Dr. Skull/ crime-fighting vigilante The Skull Killer) has to take on the forces of The Octopus before his ultraviolet beams make monsters of everyone in the city. The narrative is very unfocused and full of scattered viewpoints, but it doesn't let up and has a strange morbid urgency to it, like the babbled tale of some madman who's clutching your arm. So, for that, the gore, the historical value, and the brevity (it's more novella than novel) it's well worth checking out.

On the south side of East Broadway, between Canal and Montgomery, stands some of New York's most important Jewish landmarks, from the towering gleam of the Forward Building to a cluster of surviving 1830s rowhouses and tenement synagogues that held the first critical waves of Jewish immigrants in the mid-19th century.
Luck - or the goddess Fortuna - used to be portrayed in art as a woman turning a ever-moving wheel, the Wheel of Fortune, on which people rode from success to failure and from failure to success. Chance, fortune: the fall of the dice, the pattern of the cards, the flip of a coin - down the ages, people have used them in attempts to steer themselves through the multiple possibilities and uncharted waters of the future. Now here's a brilliant YA novel by Nicola Morgan that explores all this. The hero is Jack, a teenager with a double tragedy in his past. His life was changed for ever by a set of freak circumstances, and now he's obsessed by the 'what-if's' and 'if only's' of past and future. If even tiny events may have unpredictably catastrophic results, how can you choose your way? Jack has, he thinks, found the answer. He tosses his lucky coin and allows chance to guide him. But can chance ever be a sure guide?

By now you've heard the tragic headlines. A middle-aged woman accidentally drove her van off the side of the Bronx River Parkway yesterday, killing herself and everyone aboard - her parents, her sister, her daughter and two nieces. You may have also read statements by Robert Sinclair, president of the Automobile Club of New York, that the Parkway "lacks modern transportation engineering features" because it was conceived in 1907 and opened in 1925 as "the first limited access multilane highway in the U.S." He went on to complain about the guardrail: "It is very strange that there is a curb there," Sinclair said. "You don't put curbs on high-speed roadways because they can serve as launching pads, which appears to be what happened here. A big Honda Pilot flew over a 4-foot guardrail." The Wall Street Journal found that the State's "Five Percent Report" on the most dangerous roads claimed that the "section needs a 'deceleration lane' and other measures to improve the East 177th Street exit."

According to SteelDrivers bassist and vocalist Mike Fleming, “Cry No Mississippi” will be included on the group’s next album, which they plan to start work on in March. The song is one of several that Nichols brought to the group. He wrote it with John Paul White (best known today as half of the alt-country duo The Civil Wars) and it got a bit of exposure a decade ago when it was recorded by country crooner Andy Griggs. Based on The SteelDrivers’ Grey Fox performance, I’d say it’s a keeper. I particularly like the way Tammy Roger’s harmonies and fiddling match Nichols’ scorching delivery, note for note.

After we spent some time outside, it became clear that the kids (and adults) were getting warm. We moved everyone inside for our version of Pin the Tail on the Donkey...only this time it was Pin the Birthday Number on the Minifig. I found a basic black and white outline of a classic minifigure online and had my local print shop enlarge it for me. Using the same Avery round label stickers we used for the water bottles, we made #5 stickers for each child. We wrote their name on the front of the sticker and had them try to get as close the number 5 on the minifig's chest as possible. We had a couple of peekers...but it was all great fun.

That means I get to stay off the insulin.

Romans 1:26-28 For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.

As both Puri and Tara are thrust out into the world – Puri when he leaves Lahore in search of a job; Tara when she is abducted by a Muslim man after escaping from Sahni’s house on the night of her wedding – they are forced to bear the violence and derangement of Partition upon their bodies and then, finding themselves still alive, decide what to make of their battered selves. Although it appears for the longest time that Puri, with his idealism, his love of language, his political vision and his diligence, is the book’s hero, we see him gradually sinking, over a thousand pages, under the weight of his own worldly power in the new Indian republic and somewhat insecure masculinity – an unforgettable narrative arc. Revealingly, it is his involvement with the Indian National Congress that gradually leaches the idealism from Puri.

So the mornings are spent violating many of the child's fundamental choices, such as sleep, food, appearance, and input into their own lives - choices that we as adults take for granted for ourselves - so they can get to a place on time which they may not want to go to in the first place. That's sad. But the evenings are worse.

The nature of news itself helps sustain a climate of fear: stories of child abductions or murders in distant countries are flashed instantly round the globe, heightening the appearance of a dangerous, threatening world, even though the statistical likelihood of a child becoming a crime victim is extremely small. Products and services are sold through campaigns that heighten fear. In some suburbs gated communities have been built, which in their very design imply that the normal state of mind outside the gate is fear, which can only be absent when the ordinary world is shut out.

My one problem with Wesleyan was that they didn’t have and engineering program for the undergraduate students. They was a program for architecture which was great seeing how I may want to pursue that for a career path. But the lack of an engineering program was a little discouraging. It was discouraging because I am really interested in the subject and in all other cases the school is perfect. Now I have to choose between going to Wesleyan and Lehigh (Lehigh has a very good engineering program and is well known).

A true “stimulus” to the economy would be to relax much of these regulations and allow entrepreneurs and business owners to spend their capital on expansion and product innovation, rather than conforming to the obligations of some bureaucratic scheme. That’s not to say scrap all federal oversight, but the way things operate now, agencies are encouraged to brainstorm new policies without taking into account how they would negatively impact the economy.

I do believe that the Bible has some good stories and some good lessons to teach, just as I believe about many religions. I believe that it shows a unique look at a society (or a religious history, for the Jewish people, if you are looking at the Old Testament) and it must be read in the context of its time, as a form of history. (Something even my mother who, unlike my father, can be a bit of a Biblical literalist, freely admitted in a conversation with me last night).

If domain values exist for which there is not a unique range value, then Marker movement is unpredictable.

We were rummaging through the book shelves earlier in search of a particular recipe when we came across Farmhouse Fare – Recipes from Country Housewives Collected by The Farmers Weekly. Like the found photo albums I blogged about a couple of days ago old recipe books open a door to other lives and past concerns. The Prawn Cocktail Years (1997) by Simon Hopkinson explores old recipes as social history in a self conscious but enjoyable way and creates a framework of particular food settings that were the height of fashion at points in post-war British history. The Fifties Hotel Dining Room, The Sixties Bistro, The Continental Restaurant, each location has accompanying recipes and amusing social history. We love recipe books that function both as a good read and a blueprint for making food (friendly wave to Elizabeth David and Jane Grigson) and The Prawn Cocktail Years is such a book, excellent as a bedside book and a good companion in the kitchen.

S. Chrysostom again (Hom. 17 in Ep. ad Rom.) says: “Just as boys in play put on each other’s heads crowns of hay, and often laugh behind his back at the boy they have crowned, so too do those who speak you fair to your face jeer at you quietly among themselves. What else is this but placing crowns of hay on each other’s heads? Would or were nothing else but hay! But as it is, this crown of ours is full of warning to us, for it destroys all that we have rightly done. Consider, then, its value; flee from the loss it entails. For if there are a hundred, or a thousand, or a host without number to applaud you, yet all of them are nothing more than chattering jackdaws. Nay, if you but think of the cloud of angel-witnesses they will seem viler than worms, and their words more flimsy than cobwebs, more fleeting than smoke, or than a dream of the night.

Here’s a naive question. The article seemed to imply that you might be able to construct an interaction Lagrangian between fermions and bosons in Riemannian 4-dimensional space by treating both as quaternions, and just multiplying them in the quaternionic way. But don’t you need a scalar for the Lagrangian?"

Tonight we had a carjacking of epic proportions. How smart do you have to be to steal a taxi in a town that has exactly 2 taxi cabs total for the whole area? Someone was dumb enough to carjack a taxi and drive out on a dirt road toward the mountains (big party spot). The officers were not able to find the vehicle but im sure in the next couple days the vehicle will be found trashed somewhere in the desert. I hope the person who stole it is stranded 5-6 hours out in the desert.

Remember when everyone used to send thank you notes whenever a gift was given? When I was growing up, my mom made me write thank you notes to my grandparents, aunts and uncles for birthday and Christmas presents. Why have those days seemingly disappeared? Nowadays, people send impersonal emails if at all. I have even experienced this lack of etiquette when it comes to weddings and showers. What has the world come to if we disregard simple manors.

I have long thought there is a finite amount of baby clothes in the universe.

8) Skip hotel breakfasts. Since hotel rates are already exorbitant given the constant demand in Paris, save the additional costs of having breakfast in the hotel. Go to one of the bistros and buy yourself a croissant (a flaky puff pastry) or pain au chocolate (puff pastry with bits of chocolate in the centre) with un café. This should set you back by a few euros opposed to the €10-20 breakfast you would have to pay for in hotels. If weather permits, consider sitting in one of the parks or along the river Seine and have a morning picnic.

Wow! It's finally sinking in that the big push to get the first round of packing, the major cleaning, and all that other fun stuff is over! I can breathe a little easier, spend a little more time focusing on non-move related items. Don't get me wrong, my stress level is still waaaaay up there, I think it will be until we sell and move. I'm continually reminding myself of all the reasons why we're putting ourselves through this. But, with the stuff inside my control being done, I am turning my attention to revamping some of the systems I have in place right now. If anything good came from that frantic rush to do everything, aside from making our home ready for sale, it was that I found many things that just weren't working. And, being the dork that I am, I took notes! I kid you not, I would actually stop what I was doing to note a problem area or an idea. A little on the compulsive side, but I didn't want to forget anything, and if I hadn't I probably would have.
On September 6, 2011, Mark Yarm published the book Everybody Loves Our Town: An Oral History of Grunge. I read it and loved it, and it left me thinking about my ’90s youth, the music that spilled out of old Seattle, and also, about Vasquez. I spun a bunch of his records and thought about how his music seemed to have so much potential for wider appreciation, if not on the scale of his Seattle contemporaries, then at least an appeal wide enough to have elevated him beyond the status of “tragically overlooked local legend.” But there are those musicians who just want to write music and be left alone. They enjoy the creative process for its own intrinsic rewards and don’t want to perform publically, or make money from their art, or even involve themselves in the commercial aspects of being in a band. You have to respect that. Touring, booking, dealing with club owners, record labels and royalties – from all reports, it sounds grating. Maybe Vasquez is that type of musician. Or maybe he was self-sabotaging. Maybe he just needed a little outside push to get him going, or maybe he pushed too many people away. It’s all speculation, yet the record is indisputable: during the early ’90s, while fellow Northwesterners such as Nirvana, Mudhoney and Soundgarden appeared on innumerable magazine covers, released albums on major labels and graduated to the large concert stages and world tours that defined their mid-90s careers, Vasquez remained in Seattle, playing the occasional local venue, pressing small runs of seven-inches, and working odd jobs. Which is where he remains today: as talented as ever, and just as invisible.
Remind your child that, if the adult still does not listen, it is not his or her fault, but to keep asking until someone does something to fix the problem. Tell your child to please always tell you whenever she or he has a problem with anyone anywhere anytime.

In Nechtan’s second decade as king, centres for carving the sophisticated new imagery sprang up everywhere: in Angus there is a cluster of class II stones (Meigle, Aberlemno, Brechin); the new religion took hold at centres around the Moray Firth: at Rosemarkie – a former Peterkirk – and at Kineddar-Spynie near the great Elgin stronghold of Duffus which also had its own Peterkirk. There at least 26 fragmentary slabs have been found. An equal number were found at Tarbat-on-Beauly within monastic walls.

Every year Buffalo Trace releases their Experimental Collection: 375 ml bottles of some wacky experiment (or in one case some old barrels they found). When they first came out, these things were impossible to get and, though priced around $45 in Kentucky, often went for $200 in California. Lately, it seems they have been a bit more reasonable and a bit more available (though they are by no means plentiful). A friend shared with me some of the latest release which was announced in December and hit shelves earlier this year.

A lower court has sided with the commission, generating an appeals process. I hope, as a gay marriage supporter, that this commission’s infringement on the conscience of a photographer is quickly overturned.

One cannot promise any of the latter without first having taken care of the priority responsibilities.

What this means is that there are two registers of existence: the worldly one in which rewards and punishment are meted out on the basis of what people visibly do; and another one, inaccessible to mortal vision, in which damnation and/or salvation are distributed, as far as we can see, randomly and even capriciously. It is, says Mattie in a reflection that does not make it into either movie, a `hard doctrine running contrary to the earthly ideals of fair play' (that’s putting it mildly), and she glosses that hard doctrine — heavenly favor does not depend on anything we do — with a reference to II Timothy 1:9, which celebrates the power of the God 'Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.'"

Nonetheless, experimental manipulations in studies 2 to 4 elicited analytic thinking by having participants perform one task or another (looking at pictures or unscrambling sentences) before rating their religious beliefs. Although unlikely, it is conceivable that the act of performing any task—not just tasks known to elicit analytic cognitive tendencies—may decrease religious belief.

Although set in Paris, the film is blessedly free of the usual tourist fantasia -- shots of the Eiffel Tower out every window -- and indeed many of the most memorable moments are on studio sets. The sequence where Hepburn arrives back to her marital home, early on, to find it stripped bare of every possession is both dramatically powerful and visually striking, with Hepburn becoming increasingly frantic as she runs from room to room. The scenes in Hepburn's hotel are equally clever: Donen makes much play with the ways in which the characters move from one room to another within the establishment (it occasionally reminded me of the precise mapping of space in another Hepburn film, Breakfast at Tiffany's).

I recall a very windy, blustery day at St. James’ C of E and most of us children were wearing snorkel Parker jackets. Mine was blue with an orange lining and grey fur on the snorkel.

It was so miserable and wet. We used to huddle under the only shelter available to us there. I remember Karen Williamson rejecting me for Jason in Mrs Corrie’s class. How odd.

It's been almost two years since I was elected president of my chapter. This time in my life was incredibly special and the entirety of my experience truly shaped the woman I am today. However, when I think back to the day I was elected there is very little I remember - I was scared and nervous, and excited - and yet one piece of that day remains very clear and distinct in my mind. In waiting to hear the results of the election, what must have been only a few minutes felt completely infinite, as if I was waiting for hours. I had made myself vulnerable to my chapter sisters, for what truly was the first time. In waiting to hear the news I was on the verge of tears - in my 20 years I had never had much success with stuff like this. Then without thought or hesitation, one of my sisters reached out and took my hand. Whether she voted for me or not - I didn't know, and I didn't really care - because I knew something much more important. She was there for me, and no matter what decision had been made by the chapter, that wouldn't change. Without saying a word the touch of her hand told me that I didn't have to be afraid or nervous alone.

1960s: John Christopher’s The White Mountains: The genre is more thick with possible titles once we hit this decade, and I have a soft spot for Anthony Burgess’ A Clockwork Orange, but I think that it is wise to introduce the YA dystopia that is now the thing in YA lit. with one of the standout, best-sellers from the past. Having reread this recently, I can’t say I love it as much as I recall loving it as a boy, but the adventure-driven plot, with its medieval furniture and vaguely defined/understood bad guys (tripods? what?) would work make for an interesting teaching text. The relative lack of political insight or how things work day-to-day in this world is a stark contrast to the more full explained (realized?) texts that preceded it on this list.

So why so interesting? They're the most common eukaryotic genetic lab subject and were important for scientists to figure out how chromosomes worked. With a generation of 10 days, they are ideal for studying how genes are passed. That paired along with the fact that they're easy to maintain makes them ideal candidates. They've helped people discover all sorts of cool things like how genes on the same chromosome interact, how dominant and recessive genes interact, etc. A lot of the first tests looked at differences wing shapes, eye colors and that sort of thing. If you've ever taken biology, you know them. If you were a biology major, you know them really well.

At the risk of sounding like an old fart, in the “old days” before internet, I could not look up the 1947 Act, so I skipped over those part of the notes. I wonder how many of my peers, who may by now be in senior ranks in the RAF, did the same?

However, I’ve had some health issues that needed to be addressed (I won’t regale you with all of the gory details). I broke down and went when I was 23.
It took 13 years after the Star Wars bits for SNL to revisit the classic movie screen test concept, but now it’s only taken a year since the Back to the Future screen tests for it to be brought back for Top Gun. If this becomes an annual (or more than annual) thing, I won’t complain. Even in the details, this rendition closely followed the format used with BTTF: Alan Alda, Al Pacino, and Prince all returned (though this time Baldwin played Pacino instead of Bill); Bill again appeared twice; and Taran again appeared twice. And Andy as Crispin Glover served as a further callback to BTTF. The Tom Hanks, Bobcat Goldthwait, and Sinbad impressions all served as great quick gags, but it was only Harvey Fierstein who really had anything of substance to say about Top Gun. B+
"No, it's pretty close, Clay," I answered.
The story departments in other companies are given the short shrift. Let’s not pretend otherwise. The finance department gets lots of power – and why not? It gets the company money. The design department obviously needs funding and power too, because a game won’t be a game otherwise. But the misinformed “new” philosophy when it comes to story departments is that they are unnecessary or less necessary than these other departments when it comes to getting profits.
Cinerama Holiday was charming and dazzling. Like all the ’50s Cinerama movies, it was a travelogue. Here, an American couple from St. Louis, Betty and John Marsh, visit Europe, while a Swiss couple, Beatrice and Fred Troller, come to America. That might not sound like much, but for me it was the closest thing I’ve experienced to stepping into a time machine. We experienced not just Cinerama’s trademark audience participation effects (skiing, sledding, dizzying aerial shots), but also stepped back in time to 1950s Las Vegas and New Orleans.

My wife and I have adopted two children from Ethiopia. These two children were awarded to us on December 16, 2011. We are their parents now. They bear my name. However, I cannot bring them home to Kentucky. The U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, will not allow them travel authorization into our country. They are demanding another interview with the birth mother and will not see her until March 14, which means that it will be at least a full 3-month delay from the time we were awarded our children to the time the Embassy will hear our case.

Just this week, Jim reseeded nine acres of alfalfa. The original seed was in the ground for almost a month with no rain, and was not sprouting, so he went over the fields with a no till drill and new seed. His hope is, that with this rain, the newly seeded alfalfa will sprout, along with some of the old seed, making a thick stand.

Bestival, Camp Bestival, Download and V festival are among those that are soldiering on and it seems that the former two are some of the very few that are not suffering losses. The independent festivals orchestrated by DJ Rob Da Bank seem to be selling tickets as normal and the independent entrepreneur assures the public that they will not be disappointed and that “we’ll sell out again on both our shows.”

I intend to get a little more motivated once we start selling the house, but for now I am enjoying this parcel of time I have left in this house to smell the roses. Actually I don't have any roses, but I do have hundreds of plants coming up in my garden that I thought had died. Yes, they chose this year to come up! They must be bidding me farewell. Or just sticking their tongues out at me for not taking care of them when I was here. I will have to do a little pruning because it has got out of hand with all their rage.
It helps to be reminded when things seem to be spinning out of control that the maker of the universe is in control. Whew! That really changes things.

I can't explain it with reasonable answers. I can only say that the first time I saw the sea, when I was twelve, I marveled at its beauty, immense horizon, infinite mystery. That sense of wonder and calm never left me. Whenever I needed to feel restored, I made my way to the waterfront, walked on the beach, got myself cold and wet and totally immersed in a life force bigger than anything else.

Do those things, god damnit, because nothing sucks worse than a girl who reads. Do it, I say, because a life in purgatory is better than a life in hell. Do it, because a girl who reads possesses a vocabulary that can describe that amorphous discontent as a life unfulfilled—a vocabulary that parses the innate beauty of the world and makes it an accessible necessity instead of an alien wonder. A girl who reads lays claim to a vocabulary that distinguishes between the specious and soulless rhetoric of someone who cannot love her, and the inarticulate desperation of someone who loves her too much. A vocabulary, god damnit, that makes my vacuous sophistry a cheap trick.
At the age of 32, Rivaldo agreed what I can only imagine was a substantial financial package to take him to the Greek Super League to play for Olympiakos. His new side had experienced something of a blip – failing to win the league in 2003/04 for the first time in seven seasons – but teaming Rivaldo with his former Barcelona strike-partner Giovanni, Olympiakos regained their grip on the domestic scene.

Take the men’s 100 for example. Yohan Blake (JAM) became the youngest ever World champion, yet it rang a bit hollow as Usain Bolt (JAM) false started out, Tyson Gay (USA) was at home recuperating, and Asafa Powell (JAM) pulled out of the meet with a groin problem. In Zurich Blake and fellow medalists Walter Dix (USA) and Kim Collins (SKN) got to face ’09 bronze medalist Powell. At the gun it looked like Powell was going to run away with the race as he got his typical blitzkrieg start blowing the field away in the first 50 meters. The second 50 meters was also typical, except instead of Bolt and Gay shifting gears it was Blake as he ran past Powell to victory in a new PR of 9.82. Blake is clearly one of the elite sprinters and with this race may have become Jamaica’s #2 man. It looks like Bolt and Gay may have a new threat to deal with next year.
Once you have picked the right goal for yourself, it is helpful to have some type of measurable benchmark or target that helps you determine how you are doing. It is also helpful if you have support either through family or friends to achieve it. To benchmark and celebrate each hiking success, I started a diary of my successes that listed the stats of each hike, along with pictures to remind myself of the accomplishment. Encouragement came from my hiking friends. We all were accountable to each other – we all were reaching for the same goal to get to the top successfully.
Come then, let us again illustrate this by the inspired Scripture, dwelling somewhat at length upon it to advantage. It has then been written in a book of Moses that Abraham believed in God, but his faith was accounted unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God. And what was the manner of his faith, or how then was he called the friend of God? He heard the words, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, unto a land that I will show thee. Moreoyer, when he was enjoined to sacrifice his only son as a type of Christ he learnt the purpose hidden in God. And for this reason the Saviour spoke concerning him to the impious Jews, saying: Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day; and he saw it and was glad. Therefore the inspired Abraham, owing to obedience and sacrifice, was called the friend of God and put on himself the boast of righteousness.

Psychomainia is charming in its ridiculousness and so idiosyncratically British it makes you want die, actually die, or have a cup of tea. I really do still have a huge affection for it, it’s a strange and bizarre piece of British cinema that has achieved cult status precisely because of its absurdity and I would encourage you to give it a go even if only for the sake of a few giggles and some nice English countryside. It really is difficult not to warm to it as it’s clearly trying so hard to appeal to the young generation and be down with kids yet getting it so badly wrong that you just have let your heart go out to it and praise the effort, it’s kind of like The Fonz of the movie world, actually come to think of it, it’s kind of like me, if I was a film I’d probably be Pyschomania: not a bad idea though a bit cheap and dated, but still trying hard and loveable in its short comings and foibles, and I’d have Beryl bloody Reid and George blummin’ Sanders in me keeping it together (possibly the most disturbing sentence I’ve ever written, let’s never speak of this again). Sorry about that, what I mean to say is that Psychomania is a terrific blast, it’s a little cult window into 70s Britain that should be peeked through to see all the peculiarities and hilarities that lie within. It also stars the sister of Yvette (Vicki ‘Oooh Rrrrenéééé’ Michelle) from ‘Allo ‘Allo. But the real point is, it does exist and I’m not mad, and I think I’ve proved this quite satisfactorily here today. I thank you.

As the prospect company had grown over the years their insurance premium had skyrocketed and the incumbent agent was just sitting back and enjoying the large commissions. Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with enjoying large commissions but the problem with large commissions is that someone out there always wants a piece of yours. The incumbent agent had failed to maintain his relationship with the business owner and lost his sincerity in acting in the clients best interest. Nothing I did in this situation was different than what the other agent could have done; he just forgot the value in doing it.
I have to hand it to JW's coach, though. Last night, when our pitcher was about to fall apart because the other coach kept yelling balk, our coach told him that he didn't care how many times they called balk or how many runs scored, his only desire was for the kid to have fun. Despite the fact that we were losing, and that we have other pitchers who might have been able to do better, he just let the boy finish out the game and then congratulated him on how he played. That little boy's feelings were more important to him than the outcome of the game. Then, after the game, they were able to talk to the umpire and get a lesson on how to pick off a runner on third without getting called for a balk.
(W.W. Norton & Company) - Interview
Roy and Theodore are a curious double act, cousins who preach on the road where Roy speaks to the congregation and Theodore, confined to a wheelchair after drinking strychnine to prove his faith, accompanies him on guitar. The book's cover is adorned with the spiders Roy routinely pours over his head, to show how God cured him of his phobia, and which repay him occasionally with a nasty bite or two and accompanying infection. Theodore's paedophilia and Roy's increasingly extreme behaviour hustle them from one bad place to another. One moment of violence is so shocking because of the slow, inexorable build up to it and the innocence of the victim. As I said at the beginning, this is a brutal book which will not be for those of a sensitive disposition. I have my own qualm about it which I'll come to later.

Of 82 possible days (minus days we had no power, or I was out of the building) I used the iPads exactly half of those days: 41. This is a larger number than I anticipated, and each of those days meant I used them in some capacity for 2 of my 5 teaching periods. Many instances they were used in 4 or even all 5 of the periods I have students. One number I didn’t keep track of is how many times they were used after school as well.

Why on earth does any village need three floodlit football pitches? Are there not any other sports or activities worthy of consideration? Can anybody explain why so many floodlit football pitches are being planned in the middle of major residential areas? Has anybody even told the residents near to Old Monks Rec. what a treat is being planned for them? You can bet your life that nobody will ask their opinion. Like the residents of Mash Barn, the first thing they will l know about it is when the bulldozers turn up outside their houses. It seems that all the time things are being planned that will impact on the local residents and community without any thought of asking whether people want or need them. The whole attitude seems to be one of ‘we don’t need to consult with you as we know best’.

The first person point of view is told by “I”. This gets the reader immediately into the character’s head, but it limits you in perspective because you can only tell what’s going on from his or her perspective. Do you have some vital information that only the bad guy or the best friend knows? It doesn’t matter. Unless the hero finds it out for himself, you can’t use it. Nothing can happen that “I” doesn’t know. It limits who the reader gets to know, but it does allow the reader to get to know the main character really well. Note: the main character must be a strong individual in order to carry the entire story.

Trusteau is a handsome, capable aviator, who has honed his reputation as a “whoremaster” because that was (and is) the gold standard among predominantly male societies. It was very often a sham, or cover-up, but it was better than being considered the “odd-man-out.”

William had been married six times in twelve years, and had more children than he could shake a stick at. He had an overwhelming love affair with onions. They called him the onionater. He would eat onions like everyone else eats an apple. In the mornings, he would stop by Dairy Queen to pick up some of their famous breakfast gravy and biscuits. When he arrived at the P.D. it was an event. The other officers were always anticipating the unusual breakfast of the day. William would prepare for his meal by pulling an onion out of his pocket and cutting it up into the gravy. He kept a jar of pickles in the fridge in his office. He would pour himself a small cup of pickle juice and add one pickle into his gravy. He was a great diet tool for the dispatchers and the other officers. The man has a sick sack of taste buds. Everyone in the station wondered if he even had any taste buds. William would then proceed to put anything on the table on top of his gravy and biscuits. Packets of condiments were always added to the mixture. It didn’t matter what it was, ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard. Those watching would gag as William smacked his lips around his delicious breakfast.
Travel: Getting out of my own culture and learning how people live in other places has been one of the best things I've ever done. Being immersed in another way of life has forced me to rethink my preconceived notions about other people groups and situations in the world. I know it sounds cliché, but the truth is, all the times I've gone to another country to serve, I'm the one who is blessed and returns a better person.

One of my dear coworkers lamented that she can't make gravy to save her life. I wonder why? Gravy is one of the easiest things to make. You just have to follow a few basic rules. For one, it's that "brown stuff" that sticks to the bottom of the roasting pan that has gives gravy such great flavor. In culinary terms, it's called fond. To me, it's gold. Next, you want a rich and flavorful stock, and fond is what makes it happen. Water doesn't cut it. Last, but just as important, you need to know how to thicken the gravy. This is where the lumpy gravy fear factor comes in. Oh, I've made plenty of lumpy gravy over the thirty plus Thanksgiving Dinner's I've made. 'Nuff said. Let's make turkey gravy:

Planners have a tendency to give a great deal of attention to participation: they worry about getting minorities to collaborate in policy-making, or about recognising physical manifestations of difference through spaces such as the ‘Curry Mile’ or ‘Chinatown’? Along with many great planning ideas, this approach is well intentioned but flawed. The problem is that it sees minorities through a prism that sets cultural diversity as the most important difference affecting them. While race and ethnicity are hugely important, they cannot be divorced from wider political claims about representation, power, and equality. In other words, cultural difference is important, but cannot be separated from pressing issues of social, economic and political exclusion.

The main reason why most women who fall for the bad boys do so, is because they feel excited in some way by that guy. He may be a jerk to her from all angles, except for the fact that he brings in excitement to her life and to be honest, that is a big plus for many women, especially those that live pretty boring lives.
I am not going to bore you with all the details, or let out all of Shelby's secrets, but Havi and the Grad Students learned a lot! Havi reinforced her sit and down, she learned look, touch, she taught us how to properly feed and treat Havi, and then we went on a walk to work on Havi's aggression! We were left with handouts, homework, and a tired pup! We even passed some pups on our late night walk and Havi concentrated on her looks and touches instead of being aggressive towards the pooches. Havi loved every second, and Dental Student and I found ourselves working on our own tricks all night.

Why do we prefer to say he attempted to kill us? We could say we were in "fear for our lives" and may say that instead, but it's just not what most folks say in these parts. Folks around here don't say, "a car crossed the center-line and I was in fear for my life." Here 'bouts they say, "a car crossed the center-line and nearly killed me." If you don't sound sincere or if you sound like you're giving a memorized or made-up line... the police will sense that. By the way... don't ever lie of fudge the facts, they can usually figure that out pretty quickly from the evidence.
