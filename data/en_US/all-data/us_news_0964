One spot in the rankings may not have been the jump that Lightning fans had hoped for, but I couldn't really justify putting them anywhere else. They did beat No. 3 Reservoir in mid-September, but the two teams might finish with identical 7-3 records, and right now, Reservoir has outscored its opponents by 125 points (15.6) per game, while Long Reach has a scoring differential of 70 (8.75). Their monster offense (259 points, second in the league) has bailed them out of some spots, and it would be fun to see what they can do in the playoffs. The Hammond win was the first time this season they've won two games in a row, so they would be as pleased as punch to end the season on a four-game win streak.

Today's contest for leadership of the post-carbon economy -- an economic future certain to be dominated by nations that manage their own energy consumption most effectively and devise the most efficient ways to meet the world's growing appetite for energy -- is no less momentous than those earlier struggles.

When the film moves forward four years to 2003, Camille appears considerably changed. Her long hair is cut gamin short, and she is seriously involved in the study of architecture, though signs of her loneliness are not hard to come by. In one deft scene, one of her professors chides her for the way she has designed a potential family housing development by gently telling her "what you've imagined is a monastery."

McGuane is thoroughly saturated in Berl's voice and Berl is a storyteller. "This wouldn't be a bad time to talk about how I came to be rescued from Christianity in time to become a doctor," is typical of the way he tells his story. Dry as a bone, continually surprised (and delighted) by humanity. This is what makes Berl so memorable and "Driving on the Rim" such a pleasure to read. McGuane has invested his tale with a buoyancy reminiscent of John Irving ("The Hotel New Hampshire" comes to mind) — his way of veering off plot into the magical, even the surreal. "I knew that the spiritual component of my self," thinks Berl, "while small, was inextinguishable."

The researchers found that each type of favoritism -- home, trailing in a game and trailing in a series -- resulted in a 5 to 10 percent advantage in "discretionary" turnovers, or ones over which referees have the most influence.

Instead, Obama plans to order experiments, or "demonstration projects," that utilize alternative dispute-resolution methods -- such as panels of medical professionals to review whether doctors made mistakes on patients.

Four million more people have left California for other states in the past two decades than have come here from other states, according to demographer Joel Kotkin. The population growth has been coming mainly from immigrants and in-state births, but now the USC study shows that immigrants are going elsewhere.

I have no problem with any of this. In fact, in my circles I'm considered something of an expert on the latest in skin care. And what, exactly, is a glycolic acid vs. a retinoid, and when to use what anyway?

“It’s important that people know that these young men and women chose to do this, their belief in this country is way up there,” said Hammond. “I’ve heard today that it is not what the SEALs would’ve wanted to come home now, and it wasn’t what Sandrino wanted to do either. He believed in the mission and that they had to nip it in the bud before it came to our shores. A lot of people don’t even fly their flags anymore, which is a shame.

On the third subject, a growing chorus of wise and Washington-weary prognosticators has diagnosed the debt ceiling debacle as the ultimate example of the nation's political dysfunction. Ronald Reagan was right that "government is the problem," but in a much more radical sense than he intended: It is not just leaders and programs that are flawed but our sacrosanct system of democratic self-government that is kaput — or so these commentators say.

At issue is the second round of funding available through President Obama’s competitive grant program, designed to reward states for aggressive and new approaches to improving schools. New Jersey filed a first-round application in January, but failed, while Delaware received $100 million and Tennessee got $500 million. Up to 15 states are likely to win funding out 36 that applied.
"While the new procedures are being developed, the risk of flooding remains in many communities across the country, including areas around Metro East St. Louis," Racusen said.

With the exception of online registration and update, which could be expanded to all eligible voters, the other provisions described above present obstacles to successful voting, especially for low-income citizens. Attempts in the Ohio legislature to amend and develop reasonable alternatives to these provisions have been summarily voted down.

Heading into the spring "fighting season," some Taliban field operatives boast that large-scale attacks might not be needed to erode Western forces' sway, especially in rural districts where American troops were disliked and distrusted even before the Kandahar killings.
øHe might have more success in Anaheim because the Ducks don't seem to have the core issues that Washington appears to have. The Capitals seem like the NHL's most dysfunctional family. There is no Alexander Semin in Anaheim, and certainly no megastar like Alex Ovechkin. No matter how much Boudreau evolved as a coach, he couldn't change the dynamic in Washington.

The end result? The current 9,856-square-foot library will become a 14,252-square-foot library (including bookstore) with what city and Orange County officials describe as nicer facilities, more-efficient use of space and a nicer experience for patrons. The county says there will be more public-access computers, a webinar/computer training center, energy efficiencies and access improvements. Visitors who bring their own laptops to use the library's free Wi-Fi will have electrical hookups.

It's generally composed of wings or drumsticks tossed in either a garlic- and soy-based sauce or a sweet, spicy and sticky red sauce based on gochujang, a fermented hot red pepper paste.
There's no negative side to giving Cheechoo a chance. Will Cheechoo make the Blues out of camp, or be called up and give them some serious offensive production? Doubtful. But it's worth a chance. If he were coming to the Blues from Sharks, maybe you could say he just needed a change of scenery. But he's always had a stop in Ottawa and that didn't work out either. At the very least, Cheechoo helps Peoria and, if called to the Blues, gives them some NHL

Another common reason for mystery to surround a monument is that people simply forget the folks to whom they’re dedicated. That’s the case with the Lord Memorial Fountain in front of the Somerset County Courthouse in Somerville. The marble fountain, which consists of a shallow semicircular basin before a marble plinth, with a stream of water emerging from a lion’s mouth above a garlanded niche, was designed by the young John Russell Pope (1874-1937), who went on to plan the National Archives, the Jefferson Memorial and the National Gallery, not to mention major additions to the Frick Collection in New York City.

That's right — per the vision of British artist Luke Jerram, who conceived of "Play Me, I'm Yours" back in 2008 in his native England: The pianos become the works of art. Tricked out, jazzed up, prettified and bejeweled, they're transformed completely by the end of the process.

It's a valid point, but in the end, it makes for yet another irony, as such a bifurcation is the essential condition on which this book depends.

Ferry and Gilbert will agree on one thing: They did not like how the Cavs executed at the end of the season. Much of that could be attributed to injuries.

The only thing I found amiss when I stopped for a visit Thursday was the empty and collapsing house of Bettye Hamilton, the chain-smoking, wise-cracking lady who lived directly across the street from Sowell.

Hey, Brian: Jackson is an exciting playmaker, to be sure. With him comes the issue of character. He has made it clear he is unhappy with his contract and he has put himself above his team. On Thursday night, he looked like he quit on his teammates. I wouldn't want to bring aboard the reincarnation of Andre Rison. Heckert knows him better than anyone in Cleveland. My gut feeling is Heckert would stay away from him.

The power of coconut oil is backed by science. Scientist tested the oil amongst other oils, and it was only oil that actually penetrated the hair shaft and reduced protein loss in hair.

There are certain words you don't think of seeing in the same sentence. "Neiman Marcus" and "yurt" are among them. This holiday season, however, the store invites you to shell out $75,000 for its deluxe version, which comes with a crystal chandelier. The whole thing seems to violate the yurt ethos. (Though it does give us another two words you don't expect to see in the same sentence: "yurt" and "ethos.")

It was late January of his freshman year. Michigan State beat Ohio State, and Tom Izzo left Green on the bench. Green had been playing only a few minutes per game anyway. Green still wasn't sure Michigan State really wanted him. Michigan had recruited him harder, and MSU coaches figured he probably would redshirt. Now he had been benched for the entire game, and it was more than his tear ducts could handle.

Zellers, and I could see it in the front window for an hour and the rear-view window for another. ... by the time we got there, you'd think Zellers had built the thing by hand, he was so proud. So the remark on the floor was meant for him." You see, Kurt Zellers, speaker of the House, is a native of North Dakota, as am I.
But the cost of democracy isn't exactly being borne equally by all Americans. Despite, or perhaps because of, the social and political gains by minorities, nonwhites seem to be facing a barrage of invective these days that, if left unchecked, could damage our democracy in the long run. Even conservative cultural critics like Charles Murray are acknowledging the emergence of a disenchanted white lower class, and the Republican Party in particular is leveraging this group's disillusionment to its advantage. Some of this resentment is expressed in racial terms and goes well beyond politics.
Board member Jan Michelsen said the Walker's struggles may be comparable to those endured by other nonprofit organizations but adds that improvement is urgently needed.

Davis started despite the back issue, but was limited to just six minutes in the first half in favor of veteran Mike Bibby. Davis logged 21 minutes in the second half, but the offense never had any flow to it. Sure, the Knicks made 38 of 77 field goals. The problem was that the Heat's offense was slightly better and that's primarily the result of a 28-15 assist advantage on offense.
Some may ask: why can't the Rams bring Tebow in as a specialist? Not make him the starter but use him in change-of-pace packages? The answer brings us back to what we've already discussed. No. 1, any Tebow sightings would generate a QB controversy. No. 2, a team that needs a bunch of players won't spend $2 million cap on someone that will participate in a few plays. (Unless Tebow is a kicker.)

Each time I study what someone else believes and hear how they see the world, even though their ideas are different from my strongly held religious beliefs, I am pleasantly surprised. I may still think that their views are incorrect, but what I see, with fresh eyes, is their good intentions and their integrity.

Jewish people and groups whom I thought were damaging the Jewish religion, I found were actually engaging in what they saw as correct religious life and values, caring much more about the Jewish people than I could have imagined.

Not many Broadway prognosticators give much of a chance to "Nice Work If You Can Get," the "new" musical comedy by those upstart Gershwin brothers starring a super-blasé Matthew Broderick, or "Leap of Faith," a retooled version of the show that had its premiere at the Ahmanson Theatre in 2010 with Brooke Shields.

The Blazers didn't overpay for Wesley Matthews. He's the perfect fit for this team. He'll be worth the price for his leadership, ability to make those around him better, and what he brings to the chemistry of the team, alone. By the way, if Cunningham was the steal of the draft last year, what do you call a guy who slipped through every team's scouting radar and wasn't selected at all? What a story. • Bethlehem Shoals of NBAFanhouse takes a look at whether the Blazers or Jazz can contend, including what needs to happen for Portland to win and the worst case scenario: If Oden either stays hurt, gets hurt again, or doesn't progress, Aldridge stands pat, and Roy wants the ball more and more out of frustration, Rip City could suddenly have a new, if more mild, era of dysfunction on its hands. Portland has a good chance of treading water, but at the same time, bad chemistry and bad luck would have us looking at them like a team that may need to rethink its master plan.

It’s time for local laws to reflect common sense and reality. Peachtree City and its cart paths are no longer a closed system. Between 1995 and 2010, 24 subdivisions that border Peachtree City have authorized golf carts on their residential streets, connecting where possible to the city paths. This allows more residents to get to schools, golf courses, shopping centers and other places of common necessity without using expensive gas or adding to traffic congestion. It’s smart, practical and (let’s admit it) just plain fun. Golf carts are safe and more environmentally friendly than cars, and their use should be encouraged.

The cashier looks at me with total ambivalence, not giving a damn about all that great stuff I bought. She keys the prices into the computer and then casually flops her hand to one side as a signal for me to give her my card. I dutifully comply. And then . . . the unthinkable happens! The computer begins making strange noises, and the clerk changes her expression from ambivalent to malevolent. She turns to me uttering the one phrase guaranteed to put fear into the heart of even the most seasoned shopper: "This card is maxed out."

And I have to make a point here. When I speak about higher education, we’re not just talking about a four-year degree. We’re talking about somebody going to a community college and getting trained for that manufacturing job that now is requiring somebody walking through the door, handling a million-dollar piece of equipment. And they can’t go in there unless they’ve got some basic training beyond what they received in high school. We all want Americans getting those jobs of the future. So we’re going to have to make sure that they’re getting the education that they need."

But all proposed coal projects would bring in new jobs, much needed in the stressed Northwest economy. And there is little question that if the Northwest declined to be Asia's supply hub for coal, the fossil fuel would be sourced elsewhere -- leaving Oregon and Washington without the jobs but with potentially more air pollution from coal burning, particularly from China. Besides coal's well-known CO2 -emitting capacities, coal-burning kicks out mercury, and more than 80 percent of mercury contamination in the Columbia River Basin is blown in from global sources.

We surfaced a lot of the issues and frustrations that were holding both companies back. We made sure the employees were aware that we knew what the problems were, because at the time in 2004, both of these companies were struggling.
But unlike the Washington Street original, there's no two-block-long line, no banners along the street hailing Valastro as a local hero -- just a sticker on the door and a decal on the lobby floor. Otherwise, no one would know the basement of 226 W. 44th St. is an undergound mall of "Cake Boss" tchotchkes, T-shirts and mugs; DVDs playing on flatscreen televisions around the room and for sale in the gift shop; and Buddy bobbleheads sharing the cafe display case with a fresh batch of cakes for which there's no wait at all to buy.
People need to understand that part of developing new technology is pushing it to the limits, said Brett Smith of the Ann Arbor-based Center for Automotive Research. Stuff is going to go wrong. Thats not to say its acceptable. Youre going to take your lumps.

The study's findings suggest "that combining methyphenidate and fluoxetine early in life may lead to lifelong behavioral and chemical abnormalities," wrote the authors, from Florida State University and Cal State San Bernardino. Specifically, the combination of the stimulant drug methyphenidate and the serotonin-boosting antidepressant fluoxetine appears to act on the brain in much the same way as does cocaine.

The U.S. doesn't buy much oil from Libya, but European nations do. Libya is the 12th-biggest oil producing nation, and its light, sweet crude is some of the world's most desirable.
That ban dovetails with the most controversial element of the act and the key issue facing the Supreme Court - the mandate requiring most people to have health insurance starting in 2014. The law anticipates insurers could handle the higher costs of chronically ill policyholders without rate hikes because they would be subsidized by the vastly expanded pool of healthy policyholders.

All but a handful of Ohio counties contract out commercial appraisal work for both update years and annual maintenance, according to the state.
Like states from Iowa to Florida, Minnesota's literacy push is centered on ensuring reading well by third grade -- a critical year when children shift from "learning to read" to "reading to learn." In 2011, about one in five Minnesota third-graders failed to read at basic levels, or nearly 13,000 students. Emerging research on brain development, a stronger reliance on student test scores and the state's latest goal to narrow the achievement gap to half by 2018 are further driving efforts.
The slender 30-year-old security guard with a long, black metal flashlight poking out of his backpack wasn't worried about nodding off. Line 305, which zigzags diagonally for about 20 miles across Los Angeles, carries him home, and he doesn't have to change a seat.

"Bad bosses aren’t necessarily bad people, but they certainly can make work challenging for those who report to them," said Robert Hosking, executive director of OfficeTeam. "Often, individuals are promoted because they excel in a given job, but that doesn’t mean they have the skills to be effective leaders."
Baldwin completed the program, but its impact didn't stick. He would avoid cocaine for months, until one night when he wouldn't. Then he'd be right where he left off. And while he says he made a point of keeping it away from the "Homicide" set, and particularly from his home and children, his addiction got worse.
"They showed that against St. Mary's," Senter said. "That's something we need."

And of course, everyone is excited about the 2011 class of wide receivers that included three four-star players. Transfer Rahsaan Vaughn caught 14 passes in 2011 and is in line to start in 2012. That’s if he can stave off the greatly hyped four-star duo of Devon Blackmon and Tacoi Sumler, both of whom redshirted last season. B.J. Kelley, a three-star recruit, also redshirted.

Many hotels -- and this is particularly true in Europe -- only allow two people per room. Maximum occupancy is often set by fire codes, not the property. It's unlikely the Brussels Marriott was trying to pull a fast one. Rather, it wanted to ensure you and your family were in a room that met government requirements.
Change: No increase in taxes, according to the district, since it replaces an existing levy
I am a Catholic who has gone to mass every Sunday for 60 years. The view of the church has never changed during that time. Marriage is between a man and a woman — not a man and a man or a woman and a woman. CardinalEdwin F. O'Brien's letter merely restated that position.
Still, the Obama campaign is keen to see a sizable showing, and hopes the opportunity to hear from the president is enough of a draw.
Bonamici, a former state legislator from Beaverton, continues to run a by-the-numbers campaign aimed at mobilizing an electorate that gave President Barack Obama 61 percent of the vote in 2008 and has a nearly 12 percentage-point Democratic registration edge.

EWING -- All activity at a nightclub known for brawling and other violence has been terminated in anticipation of a sale to new owners who want to create a liquor store on the Ewingville Road spot.
Another concern might be the difficulty of the work itself, which has very little dialogue (and it's in Russian) and minimal staging, except for translations that are projected on the actors and backdrop, along with postcards from the period and video. A chorus comments on and adds to the bleak narrative and atmosphere. An exhibition in the foyer leading to the theater acquaints the audience with what life was like for the White Russian military before the revolution, when they were pushed out by the Reds. As the story demonstrates, they were left with nothing but their grand manners and grand memories.
Irsay told USA Today at the league's owners meetings that the team just as easily could take Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III, who is expected to go no lower than second to the Washington Redskins.

Think about what made you consider this offer. Have you been actively searching for a new position or did a recruiter call you out of the blue? If you were looking, you likely are dissatisfied in some way. These problems may not change if you stay. Take a good look at the new job and company and its culture. Employees at larger companies often don't have as much influence as those at smaller firms, says Ms. D'Amore. Some people who are happy at small employers don't fit in at larger ones.

Even if you're not a birder, you're probably a lot more into birds than you know. Who hasn't been amazed by that slow-motion video of a bald eagle grabbing a salmon out of a lake? And if you remember one image from last year's BP disaster, it was probably a brown pelican covered with oil.
Parents might even be to blame, in part, for the low test scores for which the school system gets ridiculed: After all, if teachers are giving kids grades they didn't earn so that educators can avoid parent confrontations, it's highly possible the statewide tests some despise are revealing a lack of skills not shown earlier.
I gotta admit, this is some riveting reality TV. When I see the young moms trying to grapple with school, a job and a screaming baby - while conflicts and disappointments surround them - I recognize what a challenge these teens face by becoming parents before their time.

Any skier or snowboarder who feels ready to make the most of spring will discover a lot of very attractive deals."

We've heard some of the candidates now running for executive speak to the need for greater transparency, accountability and protections for corruption whistleblowers.

2. The Arabia Steamboat Museum is a superb museum displaying thousands of artifacts retrieved from the steamboat that sank in the Missouri River in 1856 and was unearthed in the late 1980s from a farmer's cornfield. The cargo, bound for the frontier, included nearly everything you can imagine: more than a million glass trade beads, gold jewelry, farming tools, clothing, jars of cherries, jars of pickles and even bottles of champagne, which when opened after being underground more than 130 years were still good. The only life lost was a mule tied up on deck, whose owner refused to get back on the slowly sinking boat to untie him; his skeleton is in a glass case. The museum is at 400 Grand
