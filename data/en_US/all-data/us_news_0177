The report of the documented EPA case is not recent - it was published in 1987, and the contamination was discovered in 1984. Drilling technology and safeguards in well design have improved significantly since then. Nevertheless, the report does contradict what has emerged as a kind of mantra in the industry and in the government.
The siblings aren't stopping with Original Joe's. A seafood restaurant, a pizzeria concept and a string of steakhouses are all in the works. In June, the Duggans and Klein plan to open a restaurant tentatively called Fish 'n' farm in the Hotel Mark Twain (345 Taylor, near O'Farrell). Klein says they're keeping the menu simple -- eight rotating appetizers and entrees ($13-$20). The 20-seat bar and lounge will serve charcuterie and cheese, and sell wine for less than $40 a bottle.
Freshman guard Myles Mack chalked it up to complacency, saying afterward: “We came out in the beginning like we already won the game.” Instead, Rutgers was blitzed. Villanova jumped out to a 28-9 lead, was shooting 90.9 percent from the floor at one point, and made its first nine shots. The complete 180 that Rice’s team pulled after halftime only served to make the lethargy in the first half feel worse.

April is typically the worst in a season that stretches from March to June, said National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Bishop.

Perhaps the pitch was a bit low. Perhaps bringing an already struggling Davis off the bench in another crucial situation is a move worthy of a second-guess. Perhaps two losses in one day shouldn’t fall solely on the shoulders of the team’s 25-year old slugger.
She doesn't dress like a doctor on her rounds: no white lab coat like the one she wears in the office, no nametag.

Mark Kriegel, FoxSports.com: "Say what you want about Calipari: his two vacated Final Fours (one at UMass, another at Memphis), his quest for an NBA paycheck, and his aptitude for exploiting the rules (other coaches only wish they could do it that well). But if you value the highest level of basketball, if you value teamwork and selfless play, then recognize this team for what it is. Or was. Six players are soon expected to declare for the NBA. Three of them are freshmen, two sophomores. They're not mature, certainly not by age and experience. But Calipari got them to play wise beyond their years. Stakes are high. Egos are fragile. And college-age kids shouldn't be expected not to be knuckleheads. Still, none of these student-athletes (a phrase the NCAA uses without shame or irony) ever played as if he were auditioning for the NBA. That's an accomplishment. That's coaching. You may not like Calipari. But the coaching he's done this season is worthy of great respect."

Current situation: Once the crisis broke, the Fed acted aggressively and in various ways to contain it. The central bank cut interest rates to perk up the economy and provided easier credit to banks, Wall Street firms and even mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prevent a cascade of failures. The Fed now is moving more slowly, trying not to stoke inflationary pressure.

The western U.S. has experienced an abnormally dry winter, although the dry La Niña conditions appear to be ending. It's still too early to tell if we'll see a shift to a wetter El Niño pattern this summer.

The owners of the mailbox, Steve and Glenda Medlin, moved in 1973 to a cattle ranch in Tikaboo Valley, about 80 miles north of Las Vegas. There was no talk of aliens, and no home mail delivery.
What's happening at Brandeis is shameful. Not just because it shows a lack of appreciation for art and the role cultural expression has in the life of a liberal arts college, but because it reveals how low the university has sunk during the Reinharz regime and how vulgar its values are now. At the national level, this is a time for renewed hope; it looks as if Brandeis University is also in need of a deep cleansing and a rebirth. With the Rose Art Museum still there as one of its prime assets.
Chicago State officials caution that without looking at individual students' records, it is impossible to analyze why students had low GPAs, and reasons could include that they took only non-credit or pass/fail classes, or dropped in and out of school and completed little course work. CSU officials declined to try to find the answers for this group, citing student privacy concerns.
If there's any criticism, it's that the southern part of Italy, especially Sicily, could have been better represented since the food focuses on that region. Also, the California selections appear to work on the buddy system - just about every Peter Michael wine is listed, and many John Schwartz wines, including Pharaoh Moans, Carpe Diem and Vin Perdu, have also found their way on the list. However, they're all good selections, so you can't quibble with the quality.

But the crowds -- so far -- have disappointed. The venue, in which throwing events are held outside the main stadium, is not ideal. If Patterson had thrown the U.S. record at Hayward Field, it would have been on the infield. My guess is that the stadium would gave gone gaga.

NOAA officials say the cuts aren't sacrificing public safety. For one, they say the buoy system will still operate despite chances it will take longer for NOAA crews to repair broken buoys at sea.

The Beecher's editorial board agrees. Creative writing graduate students at KU founded the annual journal last year to gain publishing experience, naming the magazine for Henry Ward Beecher, the 19th-century Kansas abolitionist who shipped rifles to members of the anti-slavery movement in crates marked Bibles or books. The students' efforts reflect a collective impulse to create an object that would stand out in a saturated market.

This poll is based on what a receiver did at OSU, not what he did in the pros. And just based on their college career, the Buckeyes have had plenty of fine wide receivers like David Boston who established the school record for career receptions with 191.

* The truth: when I heard that the Rams had drafted a kicker in the sixth round, I thought that maybe GM Les Snead and coach Jeff Fisher were having some sort of toxic-shock reaction to drinking too much coffee, or whatever. But I must say, the kicker, Greg Zuerlein, had remarkable success at Missouri Western. And there zero questions over his leg strength. He missed one field goal last season and made nine FGs of 50+ yards. Accuracy and distance? That's appealing. However: lots of college kickers have powerful legs. The mental challenge of handling NFL pressure is what usually makes or cracks them. It is no different with Zuerlein.

It normally takes eight to nine hours to individually harvest, by hand, the 1,000 follicle clusters needed to build a full mane of hair, according to Dr. James Harris, director of the Hair Sciences Center of Colorado in Denver. Since the surgery is tricky and time-consuming, fewer than 10% of hair-restoration surgeons do it. Most simply remove a whole strip of scalp and separate out the follicles under a microscope. Strip surgery is painful and takes weeks or months to heal versus just a couple of days' healing time and less scarring with individual follicular-unit extraction, Harris says.

5 TAKE A CRUISE If you’re at the point where you’re thinking it’s just all too much, and even the deals don’t sound like deals anymore, you might be ready for a cruise out of New York or New Jersey. All you have to do is get to your nearest pier with cruise service, get on the boat and go. Many boats have enough distractions for all ages that expensive land tours are all but unnecessary. Don’t like the Caribbean? Fine. It’s not for everyone. Go to Bermuda. Or up to New England and on to Canada. Or even over to old England, with Cunard, departing from Brooklyn. (Well, maybe not this summer, what with those pesky Olympics bunging things up in London.) Sample deal: Eight days, seven nights departing Aug. 12 to classy Bermuda on the classy Celebrity Summit for $849 per person based on double occupancy (cruisesonly.com).

Wallace, who died Saturday in the New Canaan, Conn., care facility at age 93, didn't just interview people. He interrogated them. He cross-examined them. Sometimes he eviscerated them pitilessly.

The composer was Doug Quin, who's done a lot of recording and composing in the Far North: sounds of seals, fascinating sounds. And the idea was to have Kronos play "seal voice" music or the sound that's made by ice crackling -- to create these fascinating environmental soundscapes that David Harrington, in particular, heard and was inspired by. If a member of Kronos were to make a very fast movement across a string, that might send a signal to a computer to play a particular seal sound!
OK -- but then, don't all the owners have a dog in the fight?. Of course, Barkley and Jordan are buddies. It was left to Miller to offer a fair criticism, first recalling the famous incident in which Jordan told Wizards owner Abe Pollin that if he could not make his team profitable, he should sell it.

Hey, Tony: As I write this, Ladarius Webb is dancing in the end zone after returning a Brad Maynard punt for a score. Even after 12 years I still can't help but think that the Ravens should be my team. Ozzie Newsome should be my GM. Ray Rice should be my running back. Ray Lewis should be my future Hall of Fame linebacker, etc. That's the toughest part about supporting the Browns these days. I have no idea the point of my writing this. Just venting, I guess. -- Roy Lexnard, Cleveland

Here's what keeps this particular brand of conceptual cooking from veering into silliness or irrelevance: It tastes good. Great, even. Witness the successful iterations of deconstructed (and beautifully re-constructed) dishes. One, labeled "chicken pot pie," pulled apart the classic formula's primary elements, glossed them over like Angelina Jolie walking the red carpet and then meticulously reassembled them into glamorous fall comfort food.
øIn both cases, the warnings were harbingers of touchdowns. But three out of every four times the National Weather Service issues a formal tornado warning, there isn't one. The result is a "cry wolf" phenomenon that's dulled the effectiveness of tornado warnings, and one the weather service hopes to solve with what amounts to a scare tactic.
Paul Levinson, a communications and media studies professor at Fordham University, says the inclination to do "stupid things that could hurt yourself and other people" existed long before social media. The author of "New New Media," Levinson says online sharing, however, has added the element of providing video and photo proof. "It could give the police something to go on," he says, adding that trespassing alone can come with repercussions.

“Morgan State totally outclassed us one year — we were down 30, and they were getting very fancy, and Bodner got very angry,” recalled George Weinick, a player from ’54-57. “So the next year they came up to play us at the Newark Y, Bodner hired two homers. It seemed like these refs called Morgan State for travelling every time they put the ball on the floor. It’s funny now, but I personally didn’t feel good about it, even though we won.”
In part, the size reflects Parr's own history, starting with his work with Larry Stone, dean of West Coast sommeliers, at Rubicon in the 1990s.

Strip mining in the Powder River Basin began on the far eastern edge, where the coal seam outcropped from the ground. For every ton of coal extracted, early miners here had to move a cubic yard of dirt. As mining advanced westward, the coal layer dipped. Today, the average 'stripping ratio" requires moving 3.5 yards of dirt for every ton of coal. In a few years it will be 4-to-1, or greater, raising costs.

Once upon a time I took a degree in philosophy at the University of Cambridge. One of my tutors was Don Cupitt, a philosopher and radical theologian who challenged the doctrine that Jesus was God incarnate; Cupitt, though a priest himself, questioned the entire theistic notion of God. If God isn't God, one might think, then what's the point of him? But Cupitt was a brilliant andcompassionate man. I remember telling him that I was having trouble with ethics, and he exploded with an anxious gale of laughter. "In the intellectual rather than the practical sense, I trust," he said. I was 19 at the time, and I now realize that my struggles with G.E. Moore's "Principia Ethica" indeed had everything to do with my total lack of a moral compass. I was never much of an intellectual, but Cupitt gave me a lasting taste for Bertrand Russell, Wittgenstein, dotty arguments about elephants in rooms, and imbued in mean awareness that the intricacies of abstraction, which can seem like so many angels dancing upon the heads of so many pins, might indeed bear importantly upon life's cruder and crueler edges.
