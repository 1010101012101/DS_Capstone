Meanwhile, the Blazers' starting center had a different sort of cloudy night. Camby played just 3:18 in the second half, never leaving his perch on the Blazers' bench in the fourth quarter.

The cooking is largely well executed, though we spotted a few inconsistencies with the shrimp, or camarones. If it's cooked too long, shrimp can be chewy, even rubbery. When it's perfect, the bite is clean and tender. The camarones à la diabla  shrimp cooked in a fiery sauce, was a disappointment because the sauce was actually sweeter than it was hot, and the ample pieces of shrimp were all on the tough side. For $11.95, which is the highest price on the entire menu, that's a significant misstep.

Q: Since Spoelstra looks like he's been playing fantasy-basketball manager with his lineups lately, I thought I'd propose my own: Mario Chalmers, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Udonis Haslem, Ronny Turiaf. You play Haslem for the defense and rebounds at the start, when you don't really need offense, with James and Wade on the floor. Then, you bring in Chris Bosh for Haslem, hopefully improve the poor point production we're getting from the second team. Any chance we see something like this as Erik tinkers? -- Bill.

Despite the gains, there continue to be cuts as well. The latest Challenger report shows U.S. employers announced 51,728 job cuts in February, down slightly from 53,486 in January.

Sometimes, I wonder if some of us really understand what that means. With the L.A. riots now 20 years behind us and the Martin case before us, it is a good time to consider those words afresh, consider them in light of our noble ideals and too-frequent failings, consider them as if it were you, looking for recourse after justice failed you  again.

It also produces clouds of radioactive ash that includes cesium-137, iodine-131, radioactive strontium and a host of other long-lived byproducts of the explosion — known collectively as fallout.

Some art lovers surely will gripe about the composition of the collection. Photography is almost entirely ignored; so is America's tradition of great folk art. The contemporary gallery includes the requisite Jackson Pollock and Roy Lichtenstein, but the most exciting and surprising works are new pieces by African-American artists. Kara Walker's tapestry, "A Warm Summer Evening in 1863" (2008), features a large silhouette of a lynched woman superimposed upon a mob scene of angry New Yorkers burning down a black orphanage. Kerry James Marshall's painting "Our Town" (1995) depicts two black children playing on a suburban street that appears both idyllic and menacing.

Bahr skillfully portrays the tough, unsentimental facade that is Anita's response to a life of hardships, but she also lets us see the vulnerable, caring heart that lies beneath this brittle surface. She often loses patience with Davey, occasionally rolling her eyes or snapping at him in frustration especially early on, and even as she cares for the black eye with which he first appears, she distances herself from him with a kind of dry humor. Nonetheless, Bahr's Anita is not lacking in sympathy for this haunted visitor.

Gordon's doctor advised cold-turkey withdrawal, which led to psychosis. Today, Cohen says, "it is now the rule that a patient will need to be hospitalized to withdraw from a benzo," if they have been taking it for a long time or have developed a dependence or addiction to it.

Well then, I say if we're going down the path to the dark side, we might as well go all in. Let's start with Predator drone strikes against the militia movement, skinheads, and any other group that has even so much as mentioned overthrowing the U.S. government or assassinating the president. No trials, no accountability, just remote controlled death from the sky that no one sees coming. If the right wingers have no problem with murdering traitors, with no judge or jury to ask questions, then they certainly shouldn't have a problem when we apply the same standards to them.

Then it's up to you whether you want to ask a manager if you can get the deal right then or come back, says Oza, who has published two academic papers on negotiation and bargaining. Asking a manager for a deal is "always worth your while," she says. Delivery or assembly charges for big-ticket items might be negotiable when prices aren't.

Aesthetically speaking, the @ is rotund and cozy, a Santa-belly of a symbol, sleek enough to have been inducted into MoMA's architecture and design collection — True! In 2010, the museum called the acquisition "momentous" and "elating," but cheerful enough to have acquired friendly nicknames around the world. In Israel it's a "strudel," in Croatia it's a "monkey," and in Mandarin Chinese it goes by "little mouse."

Almost 175 years after publication of "Papers," Kent, just 50 miles south of London, is still known as the garden of England and the larder of London. Its formal flower gardens make it a destination, but it also has become a destination for foodies interested in locally produced artisanal foods and locally raised livestock. With its oast houses for drying hops, its farmhouses, rounded tiles and clear, leaded windows, Kent remains stubbornly rural in character.

This volunteer is an extra set of eyes and ears on this one child."

Even before the first votes of this nomination fight, the Republican presidential rivals to Mr. Romney were pointing to South Carolina. Iowa would be a scrum, they explained, and New Hampshire a foregone Romney conclusion. But South Carolina, well . . . watch that space.

The Mediterranean experience at Villa Toscana starts at the ornate iron gates in the parking lot and winds along the stone walkway into an expansive courtyard. I don't know where to look first: the decorative hotel colonnade or the splashing fountain or the giant oak.

Matheny cited Lance Berkman, Carlos Beltran and David Freese as possibilities to land in a revolving cleanup role this season. With their experience and ability to switch-hit, Berkman and Beltran project as the most likely candidates. Beltran has taken most of his career plate appearances hitting third; Berkman has received almost the same exposure hitting cleanup (2,827 plate appearances) as hitting third (2,931). Beltran is the more potent hitter against lefthanded pitching while Berkman enjoys a career 1.009 on-base plus slugging percentage against righthanders compared to .778 against lefties.

Clearly, the easiest thing for GOP members would be to hold the line on taxes and stick to their fantasy that the nation's financial house would be put in order if the country just spent less and reduced taxes for high-earners.

More than 50 defendants were also arrested in Miami in unrelated scams totaling $136 million involving community mental health centers and home health care agencies. A handful of those arrested also had criminal backgrounds, according to federal agents.
They expected it then, too, when John Elway came in. I thought Elways was an exceptional quarterback by the middle of his second season, and the Broncos finished 12-2, and 11-5 the next year. He had problems, honestly, for years throwing interceptions. Touchdown to interception ratio was 7-14, 18-15, 22-23, then he ratcheted it up and calmed it down by 1993 as he got older -- 25-10, 16-10, 26-14 (in straight seasons), 27-11 and 22-10.
The issue has nothing to do with war, or the mess in the Middle East, or how to comfort the downtrodden. But it does reflect the arrogance and hypocrisy of senators from both parties. It involves campaign finance disclosure, though not disclosure of million-dollar donors to the secretive super PACs that have dominated the presidential campaign.
du jour (so writes Troy Renck, in The Denver Post). Jimenez did the impossible by outpacing Roy Halladay in April for the NL Pitcher of the Month award, and the same day he is introduced as the winner he improves to 6-0. He already has a no-hitter this season and he's elbowed his way into what's shaping up to be to be a doozy of a derby for the NL Cy Young. It's way, way early, but consider the pace Jimenez and others have set for last year's three finalists as San Francisco ace Tim Lincecum, last year's winner, and Adam Wainwright, last year's leading first-place vote-getter, are scheduled to start:

Ohio wanted one of those shuttles as an attraction for residents and visitors. And the report Thursday by NASA Inspector General Paul K. Martin gave the state fresh fuel for disappointment.

Timing is everything in comedy, but it's a sore spot on "SNL." The whole thing feels a bit lumbering as it moves from gag to gag and scene to scene. The deliberate pacing appears as early as the cold open ("Newt Gingrich: Moon President"), and it sets the tone. That's a dreadful way to start a show. And here’s what happens: The opening credits start to feel like they go on forever, and I like the theme music. It’s to the point where even Don Pardo’s iconic introduction of each cast member starts to sounds rote.
In Chicago, people like Robert Perry are subjected to exhaustive security checks. He was patted down, his wheel chair was examined and his hands were swabbed, all in public view in a see-through room at the security checkpoint. Perry, 71, is not alone

In the last few years, major technology companies have become integral to interpersonal communication and information management. At the same time, many of these firms have tweaked user agreements in exactly the way Google has, helping the industry legally position itself for a mass intellectual property grab. That means whether you are using a photo-sharing site or a web-based e-mail account, you may have signed off on letting one of these corporations do whatever it wants with your data. As evidence of that reality, Facebook in 2009 let advertisers employ users' uploaded photos to market products without users' explicit approval.

It is batsmen who often face the hardest decision where retirement is concerned. For fast bowlers, the decision to stop is made for you by your body. Spinners can usually go on longer than anyone else; the physical demands of spin bowling are more to do with the fingers, wrist and arm than with general physical fitness. There have been quite a few spinners over the years who have played into their forties. Indeed, Hogg has frequently been Rajasthan's best bowler this year, while Murali is still dangerous. For batsmen, often the body feels fine but the results don't necessarily follow.

Brian De Palma made his Iraqi docu-thingamajig "Redacted," which, in its shape-shifty experimentalism, recalled his earliest, French New Wave-influenced movies such as "The Wedding Party" and "Hi, Mom."

Prior to the enactment of N.J.S.A. 3B-3:14, a divorce did not revoke bequests to the spouse of the testator in a will that was executed before a divorce. Now, current law will deem all dispositions (to include life insurance) made to a former spouse as having been disclaimed by that individual as a result of a Final Judgment of Divorce. This means that in cases after the divorce, where an ex- spouse is still named in the other's Will when the other former spouse dies, the assets would now skip the ex-spouse and pass directly to the remainder beneficiaries which quite often are the couple’s children.

Because I believe it's going to be more intimate, it's going to be louder.

"The most important decision was to not have any children," Schmerling said. He made that decision when he was 16, a sophomore in high school. "It was not so much economics at the time.

But a remarkable coalition has risen up against Proposition 90 out of a concern with provisions that require governments to compensate property owners when a law or regulatory action results in "any substantial economic loss." The opponents make a compelling case that the measure could effectively throttle -- or at least drive up the cost exponentially -- of any government action that does not fall within the measure's decidedly narrow exception for "public health and safety."

But for a young team with numerous holes to fill after a 4-9 season in 2007, Locker's play most likely will determine whether the team's schedule extends into December's bowl season.

The Red Wings still have championship caliber personnel in many key spots. Do they have that at goaltender with Jimmy Howard? Probably not. But Howard is good enough to win in the playoffs with a stronger core of players in front of him. That should come this summer and the results should be better next year. Holland and Mike Babcock certainly deserve the right to retool this team with the cap space that will be available in free agency.

But if the personnel changes and the Wings are still an early out next spring  then the rebuild has arrived.

Avoid bad form. This can be caused by lifting excessive weight (see above), using a strength machine incorrectly, stressing joints because you're not moving the weights in the proper path or not standing correctly. It adds up to a big risk of injury and a really inefficient use of your time in the weight room. With each machine, read the fine print and look at the little diagram. Adjust the seat and other parts for a proper fit (machines are often too big for small women and kids, no matter how much adjusting you do) and select a proper weight — not just leaving it where the last person had it. With free weights (dumbbells and barbells), make sure your body's in the correct position for each exercise. Use a good strength-training book with photos or diagrams and your gym's mirror to make sure form is correct, or work with a trainer until you have mastered each exercise.

Instead, Obama insists that we can only act with support of the "international community," meaning the U.N. Security Council -- where Russia and China have a permanent veto. By what logic does the moral legitimacy of U.S. action require the blessing of a thug like Vladimir Putin and the butchers of Tiananmen Square?

A routine flyball turned into a costly error by Rockies center fielder Dexter Fowler on Thursday. Starter Jamie Moyer got the Giants' Ryan Theriot to pop up to open the sixth inning. Fowler camped under the ball but dropped it, and Theriot ended up on second. The error opened the door for two unearned runs in Colorado's 4-2 loss. "I just missed it," Fowler said. "It should have been caught, bottom line." Fowler reached base safely in three of his four plate appearances and drove in a run with an RBI single in the sixth, but he knew that didn't erase the error. "Stuff like this happens, but you have to wipe the slate clean. There is nothing you can do to get it back," he said.

A: This is something that I've been extremely vociferous about and have annoyed everybody involved with the marketing on -- this is not just the girl with the dragon tattoo. That title was written for this book after the author was deceased. It's a very clever sort of marketing shorthand, but the only way into her is through him. And she does jump off the page when you read the book. But she is as compelling as she is because of her fondness and affection for him, and vice versa.
"Yum," she said, embedding thyme and rosemary into dark earth. "It smells so good that it makes you want to go home and just eat veggies."
A critical component of self-funding employee benefits is the purchase of stop-loss insurance. This coverage protects employers against catastrophic claims, such as chronic illness or a car accident. Stop-loss acts as a back-stop to a company’s self-funded plan: it kicks in once an employee or the company itself incurs medical bills beyond a certain threshold, reimbursing the company for claims that might otherwise devastate its bottom line.

Kunzru may be in his early 40s, but he is wise beyond his years. He has four cunningly clever, deeply humane books to prove it. In them, he has dealt with the subtle issues of race and identity; he has taken on the hegemony of computers; he has shown how a wayward past, however buried by history, can haunt a fragile spirit. He doesn't just pull characters from a fertile imagination. He has walked in his characters' shoes, made tracks in every territory about which he has written.

Muppets onboard -- The Muppets will make their debut on Disney Cruise Line in an adventure game aboard the Disney Fantasy, the new Disney ship slated to enter service in March. Guests will be able to play "The Case of the Stolen Show," an interactive adventure quest around the ship, uncovering clues via more than a dozen pieces of Enchanted Art and physical "evidence." Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Animal and a cast of more than 20 Muppets find there's a problem when preparing to stage a big performance: Kermit's banjo is missing and other props have vanished (likely stolen by a cunning thief, or more likely, another muppet). Kermit turns to the guests for help in finding the missing props. Guests go on the quest guided by a map and holding a game card in front of select pieces of Enchanted Art to unveil clues and find the missing props. Elsewhere on the ship, guests may check a Muppets message board and find a Muppet-sized stateroom door to discover clues. "The Case of the Stolen Show" is a self-paced adventure game for guests ages nine and older. It features several possible endings and multiple randomized events, so each time a guest plays they have a different experience. Visit www.disneycruise.com.

The 737-800 is Southwest's first new model since it added the 737-700 in 1997. The bigger plane means Southwest flights will require an additional flight attendant, but executives said that will be offset by more revenue and lower fuel and maintenance costs than with older jets.
MARK SPENCER: State law requires valid driving privileges and a license in possession while operating a motor vehicle. The gym ID and the verbal contact would suffice to verify her ID and MVD driving privileges on the police computer. The scenario (forgetting one's driver's license) occurs frequently and is quickly resolved by utilizing the car computer or dispatcher. Remember, even without ID physically in one's possession, a person is assumed to be a citizen. There is nothing in this scenario that would lead a reasonable person to believe the woman is in the country illegally.

Any political public-relations consultant worth his or her salt knows that the subject of Social Security is "the third rail" of politics -- not to be touched, at the risk of public revulsion and defeat. So it is, as well, to criticize a candidate's spouse or other family member, in the quest for political gain or for the detriment of one's opponent. Mr. Obama's chief political strategist, David Axelrod, showed considerable restraint as well as professional discipline in calling Ms. Rosen's meddling misstep "inappropriate."
In a span of a couple of hours last night, the Ravens signed a wide receiver/return specialist, reached a contract extension with a veteran safety, agreed to terms with three of their draft picks and learned that their star pass rusher had successful surgery to repair a torn Achilles’ tendon.

“Blue Valentine” is the story of one couple tearing each other apart over one long, drunken weekend. Nothing new there. One of the greatest dramas of the past 50 years — “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” — had a similar setup.
But about 10 years ago, the vessel ran aground. Networks lost interest in sitcoms, as reality TV stormed onto the prime-time schedule. After all, who needed the expense of a writers' room and marathon taping sessions before a studio audience when you could get just as many laughs putting 10 unpaid bachelorettes in a room with a man they barely knew?
She uses whatever free moments are available to spend time with her three children, ages 10, 8 and 6. It not only brings them closer together, but provides loads of new material. Blizzard’s talents lie in finding humor in not-so-funny situations (such as arguing over who’s paying for the baby sitter) and in voicing the things we all think but are too restrained to say. For instance, the time Blizzard showed up for her child’s first day of kindergarten and caught a sight that far outweighed Katy Perry’s recent “Sesame Street” cleavage: “One of the moms comes in wearing hot pants and an aerobic tube top,” she says. “It was so inappropriate on so many levels. I mean, we’re all at least 25-plus, we all have muffin tops. I was like, ‘Why? Why?’"

Some restaurants object to the system, arguing that if they are safe enough to remain in business, that should suffice. "We feel a restaurant is either sanitary enough to serve the public, or it is not, and if it is not, action should be taken," says Andrew Rigie, director of operations for the New York City chapter of the New York State Restaurant Association, an industry group.

Yes, I'm being sarcastic. You'd have to be some sort of replicant to read the specs of the D800 and not start leaking bodily fluids from your head at a prodigious rate, wouldn't you? There's a widespread argument that phone cameras are so good that the standalone camera will inevitably become extinct. What nonsense! Camera sales are indeed declining but I think that's simply the result of consumers offloading a popular form of picture-taking - the casual, careless snapshot - to a different device. Despite steady and significant improvements, phone cameras still only thrive under those kinds of shooting situations in which expectations are low and the photos aren't really that important.
The pieces will then be spread throughout the surrounding forest, Kight told the Los Angeles Times.

Around 6:20 that evening, the phone rang at the Hull home in the Park Boulevard area of Oakland. Dave Hull answered. A bridge worker asked, "Did you lose your cell phone on the Golden Gate Bridge?" The phone was found on the chord outside the railing and the officer had simply pressed the home number on the cell. He told Hull that Kathy's purse had also been found on the bridge. Hull and Kathy's mother, Jean, sat at their kitchen table waiting for the phone to ring again, waiting while authorities scoured the parking lots for Kathy's Accord.
