“In a nutshell, its been co-opted by the industry, so on one hand they have some mission of only supporting ‘independent’ stores, but then the bulk of releases are overpriced crap from major labels - the same ones that tried to destroy indie stores back when they had any power in the 1990s,” Steinhardt says. “On top of that, I think the collector culture of vinyl is really dangerous for the longevity of the format.

This coming year will be different in Beaverton. Our 2012-13 budget proposal is focused on supporting a more strategic, consistent, equitable and sustainable K-12 educational system.

We must consider new paradigms, foster healthy and innovative schools, and focus on transformative solutions. I am calling on our community to co-labor our challenges and to recommit to our schools and children.

We got to Weeki Wachee just in time to see "The Little Mermaid" show. Have you ever seen the seal exhibit at a zoo? It's like that. You sit on bleachers in front of a big tank, and the mermaids put on a play underwater. It's impressive. They lip-sync songs, swim and smile like underwear models, all while pretending they aren't drowning. Back in the '50s and '60s, being a Weeki Wachee mermaid was the glamour job to have if you were airline-stewardess pretty and weren't afraid of the bends. These days the mermaids all look like Tampa Bay Bucs cheerleaders.

If the real question is how often schools suspend students — which obviously affects black students more than other groups — the answer is simple: far too often. Ordinarily, the public thinks of zero tolerance as invoking consequences for drugs or weapons. But in recent years, it has been applied in alarming numbers to much less serious violations — especially disruptive behavior. The idea is that by removing the troublemaker for a day or more, the school becomes a calmer place where others can achieve.

Oh, but they try. Critical Web postings are frequently deleted, and the government is believed to pay people to put up comments supporting the official line -- whatever it might be that day. Just last week, Internet access was restored to western Xinjiang province 10 months after it was shut off in the wake of ethnic violence last summer.

The plan also faces resistance from the Show-Me Institute, a free-market think tank that says the bill gives too much power to local politicians who would designate the so-called "gateway zones."
Jim White has just released his fourth album, the best of his career and sure to remain, nine months from now, one of the best of 2008. A musically complex collection of 12 distinct songs, "Transnormal Skiperoo" belies its whimsical title by probing big questions about human behavior — Why do we put our faith in superstition? Why do we let our damn minds imprison us? Why do we "let some space case say false is true"? Why do spend much of our lives "turning diamonds to coal" and "counting numbers in the air"? Why are we haunted by a parent in the grave "saying what a useless thing I am"?

There are obvious reasons to criticize the Dolans and the Indians: drafting, talent evaluation, drafting, player development in some cases and -- most of all -- drafting.

What a Pena Nieto presidency would look like, however, remains unclear. The fresh-faced, 45-year-old former governor is promising national rejuvenation after six years of a grueling drug war and sluggish economic growth, but his dozens of campaign pledges center on more mundane matters — small-scale infrastructure projects such as highway overpasses and better flood control.

Experts claim Johnson, a Conservative Party lawmaker from 2001 to 2008, has a political ace in the hole: an ability to shrug off controversies that would wreck another's career.

Every chance she had, she went to hear live music, from all of the concerts at St. David’s Church in Roland Park to weekday concerts on the music pier at the beach and those wherever else we travelled. She took us to most of them. My grandmother took her on season tickets to Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra when they performed regularly in Baltimore. I sometimes went reluctantly as a teenager, when Motown was my music of choice.
By "Fables of the Reconstruction," (1985) the band's third album, the haze was lifting. R.E.M. became defenders and poets of the American south, incorporating elements of colloquial speech into its songs ("Good Advices," "Can't Get There From Here") . Stipe also became an ardent critic of the Reagan Administration. "Document," the band's most overtly political album, was also its commercial breakthrough. Released in the wake of the Iran-Contra scandal, "Welcome to the Occupation" assailed American intervention in Central America; "Exhuming McCarthy" drew a connection between the Red Scare and then-contemporary foreign policy; "Disturbance at the Heron House" poked fun at the arrogance of the establishment. "It's the End of the World As We Know It" was not an explicitly political song, but it shook the skeleton of Bob Dylan's "Subterranean Homesick Blues."

Gel and paste food colorings are more intense than liquid versions.
In the first moments of the Fox News Channel debate, as the candidates each made the case for why he or she should be the Republican nominee, Perry quickly invoked Tebow. But the Texas governor, still foundering in the polls, wasn’t simply trying to hook his wagon to a football star. He was also giving a coded shout-out to the religious conservatives so crucial to his candidacy in Iowa and elsewhere.

While it might become readily apparent to staff and others that an elected official is having difficulty, it might not in the case of a judge, since the average judge has fewer direct contacts.

The midwinter sun ricocheted off Italian fermenters sitting outside the open doors. Several glasses into our tasting of "buttery" Chardonnays and "ashy" Pinots, Alfaro fired up his Kawasaki mule, an all-terrain vehicle, to give us a closer look at his vines. But first he adjusted his headband to keep his long, cool-dad hair from whipping him in the face. "This is our Pinot," he shouted over his shoulder as we charged over the crest of a hill and into a valley with rows of dormant vines. Alfaro cut the engine and dismounted next to a pile of vine shoots. It was the remnants of pruning season. "This whole area is perfect for Pinot because there are lots of warm days and cold nights," he said.

The Hawks trail Boston 3-1 going into tonight's Game 5 in Atlanta, and the big theme since Game 4 has been Johnson's touches -- or rather, lack of them. The All-Star guard took just eight shots in Game 4 and is not happy about it, the Boston Globe's Amalie Benjamin reports.
