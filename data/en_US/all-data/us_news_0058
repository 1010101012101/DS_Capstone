Upset special: … then there’s the N.C. State-Kansas matchup. Let’s just put it this way—the seed differential (KU is the region’s No. 2 seed, N.C. State is the 11) is much greater than the talent differential. The Wolfpack played a tough schedule—a huge reason they got an at-large bid—and played most of those teams very well, but just couldn’t pull out many of those close games. In the Tournament, they’ve figured out how to win, with victories over sixth-seeded San Diego State and third-seeded Georgetown. Nobody doubted former coach Sidney Lowe’s ability to recruit upper-tier talent, and those players are producing results—finally, Wolfpack fans might add—for first-year coach Mark Gottfried. Future NBA lottery pick C.J. Leslie has been playing the best basketball of his career down the stretch, and he’s just one of five players averaging double figures in scoring. This is a tough, tough matchup for the Jayhawks.

I've tried this several times, and it sure makes me wonder, if people are truly concerned about the high cost of gasoline, why do they continue to drive at speeds that burn it up so fast? I'm not advocating driving at 45 mph, which would probably provoke incidents of "road rage" or at least honking horns, but if we really want to save on our gasoline expense, I think we should ask ourselves which is most important — the few minutes we save by zooming down the highway or the money we are saving to help buy the next tank of gasoline?

Namely, that being a Muslim is incompatible with being an American.

Fidelity and devotion are fool’s gold, and those who let their heart win are doomed to despondency and derision.

There are only four mechanical buttons on the device, all Lumia and they're all lined up on the edge of the Lumia to the right of the screen. The bad news: they're unlabeled, and they're identical. It's easy to suss that the two that are buttressed together are the volume buttons. But every time I wanted to wake the phone I'd guess incorrectly and press the camera shutter instead. This problem went away when I asked myself "Which of these four buttons happens to fall under my dominant finger when I hold it?"

As befits the restaurant’s name, there are dynamite desserts at Cinnamon, but don’t forget the rest of the menu. The emphasis here is on northern Indian (Goa, Rajasthan and Punjab) cuisine. The owner is Mahendra Singh, who has run restaurants in Toronto, New York City and Philadelphia. The decor — hardwood floors, orange walls — is stylish without being stuffy. The traditional Indian bread known as naan is often predictable — it seems to be baked in the same central oven — but Cinnamon’s version is thick, chewy and distinctive. The dal makhani is a seductive, buttery blend of lentils, tomatoes, ginger and garlic. One of the better tandoori chickens in New Jersey can be found at Cinnamon.

In the accompanying box, I've used each network's average prime-time rating for Sunday through Thursday  when viewing levels are highest  as a baseline.

Once you answer that question, you will become more audience-centered in your communication. If you can’t answer the "so what" questions, much of what you have to say will fall on deaf ears because in your audience, so many of them are thinking to themselves "so what?"

This won't be a cheap date. The entire menu at Red, salads and all, is a la carte. That's often the case at top-shelf steakhouses. That means your indulgence in, say, a starch and a side -- such as the luxuriously rich potatoes au gratin and a crunchy bowlful of green beans combined with tiny pine nuts and chunks of pancetta -- together add $15 to your tab. Fortunately, those sides are designed for sharing, though one can imagine a spirited quarrel over that last spoonful of extra-creamy spuds.

Chestnut, however, said that in the course of his investigation -- part of a wrongful death civil suit -- his office collected numerous statements from students who said they were "coached" by alumni about what to say to investigators.

Actually, both theories are correct -- and neither is. It's true that Wall Street took too many risks while government regulators watched passively; it's also true that the government's aggressive promotion of homeownership contributed to real estate speculation.

“Wearing your hair natural is a huge trend. Whether you select an unstructured twist, updo, pinned long waves or a messy bun depends on your preference and personality. Braids are as big as ever right now, too. You can have different types of textures in one hairstyle and still keep it simple. Last summer was about feathers; this year it will be colored hair extensions. A lot of celebrities use them, and they are great fun and inexpensive. You can maintain them yourself because of a temporary adhesive strip, and they come in a variety of colors. The dress should reflect your personality, and the hairstyle should ALWAYS accent what you are wearing. Take a picture of your dress and any hairstyles you like to your stylist on prom day. Don't bring a crowd with you; it may influence your decision and you could regret it. Have a great time!"

We probably have a couple thousand species over these three acres, and I oversee the entire collection. If I hear about a new plant - one that's newly discovered or brought into cultivation for the first time - that I think has potential for us, I'll try and track it down. There's a lot of experimentation involved when bringing new plants to the garden, and the key question is whether or not they'll succeed in our climate. There's a lot of trial and error in finding what works. I'm also in charge of hybridizing plants. I look for two plants that have complementary characteristics and combine them to make something new and possibly better in some way than the original two plants.

In Marion County, where police ranks are too thin and bean counters have spent years desperately trying to close budget gaps, the latest mistake means local government since the start of 2011 received about $34 million less in local income tax disbursements from the state than it deserved. In other words, as decisions that affect everything from parks to public safety were made, Indianapolis officials were forced to work with numbers as accurate as Uncle Ernest's tale about the size of a catfish he caught 20 years ago. Counties across the state suffered under similar inaccuracies.

The changes in individual oxytocin levels at Linda's ceremony could be mapped out like the solar system, with the bride as the sun. Between the first and second draws of blood, which were only an hour apart, Linda's own level shot up by 28%. For the other people tested, the increase in oxytocin was in direct proportion to the likely intensity of their emotional engagement in the event. The mother of the bride? Up 24%. The father of the groom? Up 19%. The groom himself? Up 13%…and on down the line.

Why are bus drivers not required to wear visible ID badges with their names displayed on them? I mean, visible from the vantage point of the passengers.

As a young woman, Robin Azevedo never thought about taking over her family's business, the McRoskey Mattress Co. When her son entered preschool, she looked for a job that would fill two afternoons a week and was hired by her father.

Americans don't have much to show for their system's enormous cost, even if the gaps in life expectancy partly reflect differences in lifestyle and diet.
Partnering with Teach for America will strengthen the hiring pool for many of our highest-need schools and subjects. Moreover, the organization will help us keep homegrown leaders who decide to join Teach for America here in our great city of Cleveland. Like in the other 43 communities where the organization works, Teach for America teachers will interview alongside other candidates for open positions and, if hired, become school district employees. In my experience, school districts want to partner with Teach for America because it creates a pipeline of talented teachers and leaders eager to work in the most challenging settings.
