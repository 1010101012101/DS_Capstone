The Cook County Redistricting Committee has an opportunity to make sure that the county process is open and transparent and truly reflects the interests of the citizens, rather than the interests of the incumbents. The state legislature and City of Chicago redistricting processes provided minimal opportunity for public input. The League encourages this paper to cover this redistricting process to help keep the public informed. The League also encourages people to attend the public hearings and let their commissioners know that they are interested in the process. Make your voice heard.

Ultimately, there's truth in both assessments. But also a separate explanation.
"I don't like that because it takes away some of my non-conference opponents," Tritz said. "I like playing St. Joseph's Academy and Incarnate. I like to go across the river (into St. Louis County). I'd like to see everybody once and then be able to get other teams on there. I would like to get a Columbia Rock Bridge on my schedule, and I don't know if that (will be possible) now."
"You might call it the Andrew Cuomotization of legislators in New Jersey," Goldstein said. "Andrew Cuomo has set the stage for the legislature in New Jersey and in other states, by championing the cause or marriage equality not begrudgingly but with gusto. And that’s happening in New Jersey now."
RICHMOND HEIGHTS, Ohio -- Entrepreneurs and wealthy leisure travelers are returning to the skies and driving up demand for private jets.
I had an airplane epiphany recently. I realized the breadth of work we've done that no one has seen, no one really knows about. That work is about furniture design, landscape design, graphic design. Any other business with this creative output -- they'd be recognized in different ways.
Phoenix remained isolated. But all that would change in just a few years as WWII erupted.
ANSWER: We did it in 2005 and 2007, so, first of all, these are 100% different kids. We try not to bring a show back until the young people have had a chance to cycle through. Since it has been our most popular show by far and we get constant requests to perform it, we thought our 20th anniversary would be the perfect time to bring it back.
Census experts pegged the child poverty rate in Oregon's largest school district, Portland Public Schools, at 18 percent in 2010. That was the highest estimate for the district since 2005, when the rate was pegged at 20 percent, and much higher than the 2008 estimate of 14 percent.

It's OK, Sparky, just the werewolf doing his moonwalk. -- Kathy McEllen, Bainbridge Township
He added that about half the patients he sees say theyve timed their procedures to college basketball.
This is treacherous territory because we're treading on sacred land. But there's no disputing that he's the Spartans' most "complete" player since Magic Johnson. Yes, I know. Magic might be one of the three greatest basketball players anywhere who ever breathed, and he's certainly deserving of his own secluded spot in a separate stratosphere. But the Spartans' reliance on Green doing pretty much everything -- and doing everything reasonably well -- deserves some special historical recognition. Nobody can ever be in the same sentence with Magic. But Green's ability to control a game from various positions shows he's somewhere in the paragraph as it pertains to Michigan State.
Young adults with bachelor's degrees are increasingly scraping by in lower-wage jobs - waiter or waitress, bartender, retail clerk or receptionist, for example - and that's confounding their hopes a degree would pay off despite higher tuition and mounting student loans.

Roles, the Manhattan mother of three girls, has decided to opt out entirely. She does not offer goody bags, has sneaked out of parties to avoid taking them and has thrown bags out rather than risk bringing home anything with lead. For her oldest daughter's third birthday, she made a donation to the nonprofit Heifer International (which gives livestock to needy families) on guests' behalf; post-party, she found her gift cards littered all over. Now she has "beautiful" cookies made by a local mother.
It's astonishing just how long Springsteen has been making important albums -- not quite 40 years, with relatively few dips in quality. Compare that to the Beatles (eight years), Elvis Presley (22 years) or any other comparable classic-rock icon and that accomplishment becomes even more impressive.

"This was a hot corner when that liquor store was there," Marqueece Harris-Dawson said Saturday as he toured South Los Angeles. In the 1990s, the intersection of Van Ness and Manchester featured a liquor store that sold drug paraphernalia. Outside, dealers were waiting to help customers put their new purchases to use.
I don't care for the Masters. The major golf tournament is obnoxious. Its deep history and rich tradition are rooted in racism and sexism. Maybe I'd feel differently if I were racist and sexist, but we deal with the hand we're dealt, I suppose.

Our goal was to be the best conditioned and most disciplined team out there and hope things would fall into place.”

The U-T San Diego's story about port commissioner and staff travel expenses is off base ("Port execs eat well and fly first class," March 25). You have to be out there pounding the pavement in these hard times if you expect to develop business. Establishing new relationships and showing commitment to existing customers is not only good business practice, but essential now as the port and public continue to be distracted by delusions that their port facilities could or should be converted to sports facilities or beaches. Hats off to the port for taking on trade missions to China, India, Central America and Europe to support the 40,000 jobs in the region that depend on San Diego's maritime industry.

* Of course, the increasingly idiotic mob that dogs Sam Bradford was frighteningly aroused by Clemens' performance. After reading some of the comments, I'm not sure whether we should just stop at inducting Clemens into the Rams' Ring of Honor; I'll call Joe Horrigan at The Pro Football Hall of Fame to see if there's a chance of waiving the five-year waiting rule to get Clemens into Canton, ASAP.
"I was never really much of a church singer," says Spector, 67. "Growing up, Christmas music was what my parents liked. They played Frank Sinatra and Burl Ives, records like that. And you know you never want to listen to what your parents listened to. You want a sound of your own."

Height: People born in spring tend to be taller, according to Gerhard Weber, an anthropologist at the University of Vienna. Analyzing Austrian Federal Army measurements of more than half a million men, he found that the tallest recruits were born in April, the shortest in October. Although the average difference was small (0.2 inch), the finding, reported in 1998 in the journal Nature, was statistically significant. Weber speculated in his study that the effect could be due to concentrations of the light-dependent hormone melatonin in the mother's body, which might stimulate secretion of growth hormones. Since human fetuses and babies grow in spurts, the amount of daylight during periods of fast development would be crucial.
After drafting Memphis nose tackle Dontari Poe in the first round on Thursday night, the Chiefs added three players who weigh more than 300 pounds. That would seem to signal the Chiefs are ready to draft smaller players today, but Pioli wasn't willing to concede they would be going there.

The Orioles will need to make a move to add Eveland to the 40-man roster. They could place a currently injured player on the 60-day disabled list: second baseman Brian Roberts, who has been on the 15-day DL since March 26, or catcher Taylor Teagarden, placed on it April 4, are possibilities.

So Pope had to do some extra work to find “that guy,” scrounging through college game film in search of a tight end that fit the Giants’ thinking. Knowing that college football has fueled the metamorphosis as schools across the country have implemented spread offenses and filtered receiver-first tight ends into the NFL, he went straight to the Big Ten, where the style of play tends to lend itself to the type of player they were looking for.
The blanket rule, he said, would prevent jailers from making mistakes and accidentally not searching someone who actually is concealing contraband like weapons or drugs.

I become faint; the light around me dims and changes to an unearthly red glow. I begin frantically searching through my wallet for another card, the clerk watching me with a demonic gape.

With a contemptuous flick of her finger, she sends the worthless piece of plastic scuttling back toward me. Got to keep looking.
Then a strange thing happened. I watched the first episode, because, you know, it's my job, and I liked it. Maybe "liked" isn't exactly the right word.

In a basketball world where too many dreams are fueled by straight cash, sometimes we measure a player more by his ability to earn NBA checks than his potential to develop. The obvious hole in Roberson's game is his jump shot. Standing 6-7, he needs a serviceable one to thrive at small forward in the pros. But we sometimes forget that Roberson has yet to celebrate his 21st birthday, and he's far from fully grown as a player.

The attraction would need to fit in with the bridge's maintenance, satisfy safety and security concerns and be unobtrusive to motorists, Currie said. It will need to be educational, tie in with a new interpretive area being built with a National Science Foundation grant, and include a visitor center.

Logos and large signs would be prohibited, Currie said, acknowledging the response to an unsuccessful 2007 proposal to seek corporate sponsors that would have been able to display corporate logos near, but not on, the bridge.

That could become more common, unless of course the proposed competitive balance referendum is passed in May and takes some of the edge off, which is its intent, but remains unproven.

Answer - Fibromyalgia, like chronic fatigue syndrome, has no outward signs of illness. And also like chronic fatigue syndrome, its cause remains a mystery, making treatment difficult. People with this condition hurt all over and are engulfed by energy-sapping fatigue. It is like chronic fatigue in many aspects. One feature unique to fibromyalgia is tender points, points on the body where the examining finger of the doctor elicits pain far out of proportion to the pressure the doctor applies. Each side of the body has nine such sites, for a total of 18 tender points. Identifying 11 of these areas helps secure the diagnosis.

Voorhees of the U.S. district court in Seattle ruled that the government had withheld from the U.S. Supreme Court in 1943 critical information that might have led the high court to strike down the legal foundations of the internment.

Exposure times can last anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes, sometimes even longer.

He can hardly improve on his strikeout ability. His career mark of 12.2 whiffs per nine innings is the best among active pitchers. And, much like Rivera with his cutter, Robertson mainly thrives with one pitch. Yes, he will mix in a breaking ball. But he lives with his fastball.

"The fee-for-service payment system ... encourages ever more testing and treatments. We're not sure which ones make a difference, but we keep on getting them, and costs keep rising. Millions of people cannot afford insurance as a result. Millions more have had their incomes pinched by rising insurance premiums. Medicare is on a long-term path to insolvency.

The Soriano stuff was fair because I had already taken a public position, and it was radically different than what ultimately came. So I think being in this environment, the speculation regarding the Soriano signing, and what it really meant, and does it all mean anything? That was all fair. I answered every question honestly and it will go whatever way you want to go with it after that. Believe it or not believe it. But in terms of the speculation of what does this ultimately mean, that’s all fair. I can’t criticize that aspect of it. There’s other things I can certainly criticize.
About half the states and the federal government authorize law enforcement to collect DNA samples after an arrest, and courts across the nation have ruled for or against the constitutionality of the practice.

Mike Acker: Patty is obviously Portland’s other third point guard. As unpopular with the fan-base as I think it might be, Portland probably has to move on from Patty. I like his energy, and he was able to have a couple of big nights when actually got into the game, but I think there are probably better things the Blazers can do with that roster spot next season. I feel like we’ve seen what Patty can do, and it might be time to look at somebody else for the back-up point guard position.

Here's a different take: If the Nuggets don't finish among the top six teams in the Western Conference, making the playoffs is fool's errand.

Josh McCown didn't set the world on fire in a loss Sunday to the Green Bay Packers, but it was obvious after one quarter that he was better than Hanie, who had been the starting quarterback for four consecutive losses.

Edward Lee, reporter: According to ESPN's John Clayton, the Ravens' 2012 schedule is tied for the fourth-toughest in the league as the opponents boasted a .523 winning percentage in 2011 compared to the .477 percentage their 2011 opponents had compiled in 2010.

A CRITICAL TIME
The main thing here is that someone has come up with a new and powerful way to film a thriller: "Silent House" contains no quick editing in the active moments, and there is never an instance when the movie cuts unexpectedly to something scary as the soundtrack thunders. All the tried and true methods of getting an audience to scream  including all the cheap stuff and the clichés  are swept away.
Gorman said the changes aim to bridge the branches -- aimed at individuals and small businesses -- with the products and services offered to big businesses.
Keenon said the school board will monitor the library closely, perusing quarterly fiscal updates, its fundraising campaigns and business partnerships to make sure the library is sustainable. Opponents of inclusion need to be given a chance to keep the library independent, she said.
A. This is a tough question for me because I have struggled with focusing on one professional goal since my high school years. This is the primary reason that I attended a community college first. I was not ready to make a career choice. Even today I am drawn into many different areas of interest. If I could, I would fly helicopters, or travel the world in search of the most impactful photograph, or run a custom car refurbishing business.

Lindquist starts each appointment with an assessment to determine if the client's lifestyle matches what they have in their closet. Then she talks about the best colors and styles for each client. By the time she's done, she cuts the contents of most clients' closets in half. The general rule is that most people wear just 20 percent of their clothing. "I want to flip that percentage so they're wearing 80 percent of it," said Lindquist.

"It's great that women will have the opportunity to do this now, for the Olympics," said Ali, who's president of the Women's Sports Foundation. "They do it because they love it. They don't do it to make money. A lot of times, they're working a job, going to school, dealing with their families -- and then they're boxing. It takes a tremendous amount of focus and energy and dedication, and now to be able to do it on a world level, that's just a dream come true. To be the first -- that'll go down in history."

Forget that the Commodores have a ton of momentum from knocking off top-ranked Kentucky in the SEC Tournament championship game Sunday. They average almost nine 3-pointers per game on 39 percent shooting, the exact formula needed to beat Syracuse's zone if they meet in the Sweet 16. However, Vanderbilt lost to Richmond and Murray State in the first round of the last two NCAA Tournaments.
Polistina disputed Whelan’s claim that he was to blame for the nasty tone. "They said because I voted against the budget that I’m against blind kids and kids with disabilities and sexually abused kids," he said. "The facts remain he is getting $150,000 without a full-time job, he has gotten a pension based on being a politician and this job he created for himself."

Stasists see Borders succumb to e-books (and Amazon) and lament the passing of familiar things. Dynamists say: Relax, reading is thriving. In 2001, the iPod appeared and soon stores such as Tower Records disappeared. Who misses them?
The sitting room, fondly referred to as the cigar box—the walls are lined in 1920s plywood—has deep puce velvet sofas with a mixture of poison yellow silk and linen cushions. There is a woven tartan carpet on the floor, family photographs on tables and broad white antlers over the mantel, a shopping find of Isabella's rather than a hunting trophy of Colin's, who says they are the antlers of a "whoopety"—meaning he has no idea. In the dining room, original charcoal sketches depicting scenes from the hill are drawn onto the walls. These, and the window shutters stamped with the names of the family, former guests and their game bags, date back to Cawdor's forebears. Isabella has used a mixture of Robert Kime and Raoul textiles as well as vintage fabrics for the upholstery. With the help of furniture designer Marianna Kennedy, she has reproduced one of the original floor lamps in resin. She dredged the local junk and antique shops for linens, small tables and pieces of china that are found throughout the bedrooms. Drynachan also comes with a young chef, Lawrence Swan, who cooks with as much local produce as possible: lamb and blue hare off the hill, salmon from the river, mushrooms picked in the woods. There are also delicious things from the sea: haddock, scallops, clams, lobsters (from the west coast and nearby Moray Firth).
We all know the dangers of chocolate, but did you know that grapes and raisins can cause kidney failure? So no oatmeal cookies, please.
Native to Europe, North Africa and Asia, fig buttercup functions as a perennial spring ephemeral. It makes a showy cameo appearance for a brief period in late winter and early spring, then gradually disappears underground as the heat of summer arrives, leaving behind no trace until it reappears the following spring. Despite having been introduced as an ornamental groundcover and its disappearance every summer, it can become very weedy over time and is considered an exotic invasive weed in some parts of the country.
The more time you spend in these occasionally gritty, mostly gentrified neighborhoods around the park -- Silver Lake, Los Feliz and Echo Park -- the more you realize they're incubators of American pop culture. Thousands who live here work onstage and off in movies and TV, make music, art, theater and all manner of Web fodder, savoring all things vintage and ironic. Yes, Hollywood is glitzier, and Beverly Hills is richer. But who's cooler?
The difficult economic times from which we are just now beginning to emerge were tough on the furniture business, whose fortunes are closely tied to those of a housing industry that has been hit really hard.
The thing is, Bonterra adds sulfites to all of its wines, according to winemaker Bob Blue. "Wine wants to turn into vinegar, and it wants to oxidize," Blue said. "We're drinking it midcourse. We don't go out and drink 3-year-old apple juice."

Harwell lived his job in ways that most of us can't imagine. That was how he wanted it. Carey and Ernie's daughter Carolyn say that when he was infamously fired after the 1991 season, he was not depressed. But when he came back, he came all the way back: every game, every year.

Bassist Steve Lester, one of 48 current CSO musicians who made the 1990 trip (102 musicians are traveling to Russia this time), remembers the overnight train from Leningrad to Moscow creeping along with many unexplained stops, allowing him to gaze out onto bleak wintry scenes.

The pitching has been just as inconsistent, including Yovani Gallardo. Though better than in his previous start in St. Louis when he was pounded for eight runs in two innings, Gallardo nevertheless struggled to limit the light-hitting Padres to three runs over six frames.
I disagree, although I do believe that Rolen never seems to get his full due as an elite player. When healthy he excels at every part of the game (hitting, fielding, baserunning), and he is also a leader and a mentally strong individual. During his tenure in St. Louis, the Cards reached the World Series in the only two years that Rolen was in the lineup for the playoffs; they never reached it without him. In my opinion, that's not a coincidence.

Spurs guard Manu Ginobili found a wide-open three-pointer. The shot bricked off the rim, but Splitter fought for the long rebound over Pau Gasol and Matt Barnes and passed to Ginobili. He then fired a pass inside to Matt Bonner for an easy layup.
