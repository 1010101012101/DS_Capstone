My roots in Track and XC lie in El Paso,TX. The most notable Track athlete to come out of the city would be Alan Culpepper ,however, there have been many others over the years that put up some great performances. El Paso was not unlike any other city in the sense that High School Track and XC got very little media coverage. I have kept a list that goes back to 1956 for performances by El Paso Track athletes who cracked the National Lists. Some years the lists were 10 deep, some 25 and some years 50 deep. Some great times/marks may have been left out because of this. I only have the mens lists as well. I have been searching for the women's rankings as I would love to put those up as well.

The interoperability and compatibility issue is key, and a major obstacle is the lack of a common language and agreed operational standards for expressing, identifying and communicating rights information both across industry sectors and across national borders.
A note on how to run it: Download the .exe, save it to somewhere, and run it. It will extract all the necessary files to a directory of your choice. When that is all said and done, navigate to the directory and click the icon that looks like a horse/rook/knight. That should run the game.
There are so many good people in the world who want to do their jobs well. There are so many people who are willing to help wherever they can. Sometimes it's easy to forget that, but it's genuinely wonderful to be reminded of goodness.

For how else can you explain Umno and PAS disagreeing on Ketuanan Melayu, yet pally pally for enacting firmer syaria laws? Or DAP, PAS and MCA sharing the same opinion on the Allah issue, or Umno in Perak forgetting its past history with the institution of royalty.
I miss you, Baby. More than I ever thought possible...
I feel like last week wasn't too exciting baby-wise. I do love the stronger kicks though. We're still remodeling our room, and we're onto the paint now, so there's a lot of Mommy has to stay out while Daddy paints going on, which is fine. I like having the excuse. Hopefully you'll be better than me and get your daddy's hark working ethic.
Salman Khan and Kareena Kapoor have acted together in several films, including last year’s blockbuster Bodyguard. They share a great rapport and have always come forward if one requires any help professionally. So when Arbaaz Khan approached Bebo to groove to an item number in Dabangg 2, not only did she agree, but also said that she wouldn’t charge a penny for her stint in the film. Salman, as a token of appreciation and gratitude, has decided to gift Kareena a BMW 7 series car.

They will no doubt be keen to ensure that if they can install their preferred regime, from within the ranks of the anti-Gaddafi forces, some of whom the Imperialists were negotiating with long before the rebellion in Benghazi began, then that regime will provide them with the most advantageous terms. What is for certain is that the real costs of that will be imposed by Imperialism and its Libyan allies upon the Libyan workers.
The important functions of your digestive system are managed mostly by bacteria and not by your own body. The bacteria in your gut comprise what is called your normal flora. Foods and supplements that replenish them are called probiotics. Probiotics have formed a vital part of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern diets for thousands of years, in the form of fermented milk and vegetable products such as yogurt and pickles. They are credited, in part, for the remarkably low rates of chronic, age-related diseases that prevail in those regions. I love yogurt and try to eat it as often as I can but sometimes my best intentions get waylaid by a busy lifestyle. Research is catching up with this traditional wisdom in the form of a new science called pharmabiotics — the use of broad spectrum probiotic products to improve intestinal and immune health. The science of pharmabiotics is based on an explosion of research highlighting the amazing health benefits of the trillions of bacteria living in our bodies. These bacteria are so intimately involved with our lives and health that they are considered an actual part of the human organism.

Anyhow, I thought I would start my top-10 experiment with an easy one -- my choices for the top ten science fiction movies of all time. You will notice that there are few old ones here, as my taste is rather limited in regards to older films. There are also some I won't list that I see on other top lists, because I don't consider them to be sci-fi.

After about 20 minuets of skin to skin they cleaned and wrapped him than brought him straight back to me. We attempted to nurse, but he wasn't very interested. We just stared at him and thanked God for him. We quickly texted photos to family. I was totally over whelmed with joy and endorphins. I felt amazing.

When we got there, there was a huge crowd of people surrounding the Melt Mobile truck. Bobby Flay’s production crew for his new series Three Days to Open coming out in July held up a sign that said if you’re standing here, you are agreeing to be shown on camera. I used write these for my clients, so it’s funny being on the other side of it! We didn’t see anyone leave, you’d be crazy to leave…especially if you realized what was in store. After a few minutes of waiting, the hungry mob was given permission to move forward and form some kind of blob-like line. This is where Darwin’s theory comes in, though it was more survival of the hungriest. We keed, we keed…it was a high-spirited group of foodicionados that chatted about their favorite restaurants, foods, and what they’d want to order here as we waited. In fact, we got to meet lots of our Facebook and Twitter foodie friends in person which was half the fun!
Right now onto my project for today!!!!!!!! A few weeks ago I went to an awesome retreat known as Camp Mojo and had a ball!!! So what better to scrap than a weekend away with good friends :) I always grumble a bit about mini albums as I don't like the getting it all together ready to scrap bit - but print out a bunch of photo's - cover each page with different paper and start at the beginning!!!!!! I ALWAYS fall in love with it as I go and by the end of it - discover it is so worth the effort and love how mini albums turn out :)
When we all got to come home together he learned to coo, drool, smile, army crawl, scoot, put things in his mouth that he shouldn't and laugh out loud so big I thought he might stop breathing. This all happened in what seemed like a matter of minutes. He is wicked smart, you know.

Suddenly I had an epiphany about why I keep rushing things why I want get things ended already when I haven’t started it yet. Then this realization occurs that by making things happen I have to live my life to the fullest. Thus I won’t have any regrets. What will I really accomplish if I get the remote and clicked fast-forward button? Yes, I will immediately see the conclusion instead but I haven’t really enjoyed the movie and it is not really worth it.

Have you read most of what's written in the gospels? It's boring as shit. Jesus' ghostwriters are TERRIBLE. Imagine having someone describe in about 150 pages why wearing socks with tennis shoes is a good thing. It's like the history of Canada – nothing happened for the longest time, there were a couple French settlements, they politely asked England for independence at some point, and then they gave the shittiest land they have to some walrus-humping people. See? Nothing fucking happened. You'll never see a movie based on the history of Canada because it would last 20 minutes and it would still bore

I just love boys I get along so well with them. Like all my friends are guys." Cass says, "me too!!" and I laugh. Not me. I'm exactly the opposite. But it turns out we all grew up around nature and rivers in England, Oregon, Michigan and Australia. Maybe that's why we are all so relaxed around each other? Whatever it is, the shoot is great.

"Jacob is travelling with the flocks and other gifts he is taking to his brother Esau in the hope of appeasing his anger. A stranger appears, blocking his path, and engages him in a fierce struggle which ends when Jacob is struck on the nerve of his thigh by his adversary, rendering him powerless. The holy book see this struggle as a symbol of the trials God sometimes sends His chosen ones."

Species records for the site may also be available, surveys may have been carried out on site over the years and been sent to the local records office.

Today’s “Dream Home” comes from fellow Texan, Katie of Modern Eve. Her Dallas-based blog explores all of my favorite topics: fashion, décor, travel, and entertaining. I couldn’t help but get a kick out of seeing that she recently featured the gorgeous Beverly Hills living room designed by Melissa Warner of Massucco Warner Miller that was featured in the last issue of High Gloss. It was the last photoshoot I worked on for our dearly departed magazine. Anyhow, Katie has great style which is definitely reflected in the gorgeous “Dream Home” she put together for us today.
Just as it’s unwise to walk around with a hard three-hundred cash, it’s plain stupid to keep all your money in one debit account. ATM fraud and online hackers are real threats. I’ve met two Americans in Brazil who lost over US $30,000 because they were careless with their ATM accounts (this is not the norm but apparently happens).
How to celebrate such an incredible event from our future history? How best to commemorate this monumental meeting between humanity and intelligent beings from a world beyond our own? How to take a few minutes out of our bustling, chaotic lives so that we might pay tribute to this watershed moment, which will usher in a new era of peace, optimism, prosperity and collaborative spirit as the people of Earth take their first tentative steps into a larger universe? You’re right; we couldn’t just let that pass by unrecognized.

She found herself standing backstage, along with the usual groupies. Someone asked her something, and she stuttered, “I’m with the band”. They smiled knowingly, and walked on by. The band was winding down, having a few drinks. Billy, his buddy and guitarist, handed her a glass. She took a sip, and grimaced. Then she heard the voice. His voice.
Have you ever noticed people talking about how bad things are today? All the time I hear people say or I see on websites where they have posted that things are getting so bad nowadays. But really are things getting that bad. I truly believe it is not so much that things are getting worse but that we are just more social aware of what is going on around us.
Anne has been stricken with tuberculosis and cannot carry on Helen’s tours which are bringing in less and less due to her Socialistic speeches. Something must be done and quickly as she is worsening every day. Nothing to do but hire a personal secretary to take care of Helen, correspondence, lectures, etc. She appeals to her ex-husband for help and he sends them Peter. Immediately Helen is aware that the atmosphere has changed. Anne isn’t fond of her replacement but Helen is becoming more so by the hour.

This past weekend I was a part of a 5 family Garage Sale, selling things we no longer needed to free up some space in our house and raise some serious scrapping money ;) While the 5 of us women got to talking and sorting through each others items, it was apparent that everyone would be going home with as much stuff as we/they had brought, to sell - LOL. I was lucky, and made a couple serious scores. I picked up a brand spanking new Pampered Chef Mandolin, Pampered Chef Deep Dish Lasagna Pan, Pampered Chef Cheese (hand crank) Grater, and Pampered Chef Cookie Press, all for a total of - 4 of my handmade cards out of pocket!!!!

Celebrate God all day, every day. I mean, revel in him! Make it as clear as you can to all you meet that you’re on their side, working with them and not against them. Help them see that the Master is about to arrive. He could show up any minute! Don’t fret or worry. Instead of worrying, pray. Let petitions and praises shape your worries into prayers, letting God know your concerns. Before you know it, a sense of God’s wholeness, everything coming together for good, will come and settle you down. It’s wonderful what happens when Christ displaces worry at the centre of your life.

I urge you to read this book...it was truly a work of art. It sounds cliche (which the author avoids), but this book is truly amazing. Oh, and it is a fabulous cure for the Winter Blues.
If you can’t tell, I have a reading habit. I haven’t read “Manning Up” yet, but I’ve certainly heard a lot about it. Earlier this month, I was intrigued by a Forbes Magazine piece by Megan Casserly called “Why We Need to Stop Bemoaning the End of Men.” What I found interesting about it, like most of the coverage of the masculinity crisis, is that it was penned by a woman who basically says that writing about economically-driven shifts in gender roles as if men are becoming women is, in itself, sexist.

Today, it is my distinct pleasure to introduce a blogger who I actually know in the flesh. I’ve actually laid my real eyes on him, more than once, and we’ve actually had conversations that didn’t happen over a computer. They happened in PERSON. I know, I know, how terribly proletarian of me. But, I digress. Here is the truth of the matter — I LOVE THIS GUY AND I LOVE HIS BLOG. He’s new here and he doesn’t know anybody and I like introducing cool people at my party, so please welcome:
Turning to economic policies, measures in the euro area played a key role throughout the quarter. In terms of European governance, the seriousness of the sovereign debt crisis led control over public finances to be strengthened. This took the form of the signing, on 2 March, of the Treaty of Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union. The Treaty incorporates the Fiscal Compact, under which 25 Member States, including Spain, have committed themselves to transposing into national legal frameworks a balanced-budget rule and an automatic correction mechanism for deviations at national level. Further, to reinforce surveillance of non-fiscal macroeconomic imbalances, the Commission presented in February its first Annual Alert Mechanism Report, designed to detect and correct situations of risk in this area. The report identifies 12 EU countries, including Spain, which should be examined in greater depth to determine whether the degree of severity of the imbalances detected calls for the initiation of an excessive imbalance procedure. As to crisis-prevention and resolution mechanisms, significant headway in setting up the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) was also made. The ESM required amendments to the Treaty on European Union, and its full operationality as a permanent facility has been brought forward one year (to July 2012) and its financial capacity (€500 billion) has been temporarily raised with the resources not used by the European Financial Stability Facility.
Who is this army? Or, who is in this army? It is not angels. Because look at the description – "dressed in fine linen, white and clean" (Rev 19:14). Verses 7 and 8 make clear to us that it is the bride of Christ, the church, the people of God, who wears "fine linen, bright and clean" (Rev 19:8).
The tangerine dress will be invaluable in the office come summer and as Kirsty has a good waistline, the drawstring will emphasis this. You can also conceal the drawstring and add the plaited belt to pull the look together when wearing the tan sandals. From LK Bennett its not cheap but will be a worthy investment and can be worn at weekends with flat sandals, the perfect hot sunny day dress and because Kirsty only needs to do smart/casual she doesn't need or want anything too structured.
Or haven't you heard?
If UTIs keep occurring, identification and treatment of the underlying cause is essential. Patients who have the same infection coming back can be managed successfully by attending to ‘bladder toilet’ (drinking 2 to 3 litres of fluid daily and always passing urine at bedtime and after sex). Drinking 250 to 500ml of cranberry juice daily and avoidance of bubble baths may also help. If these measures fail, six months of continuous therapy with low dose antibiotics is usually required.

As is so often the case, it’s the back-office staff who will suffer most. BMI has the finest HQ in aviation, a stately home close to East Midlands airport called Castle Donington. But many of the functions carried out there, from marketing to finance, will simply be absorbed by existing BA departments with little room for staff to be tranferred. Survival prospects are highest for front-line staff at Heathrow – 1,100 ground staff, cabin crew, pilots and engineers will find that they are working on planes with a different livery.

The Stamp Act of 1765 was a was a tax that the British Parliament imposed on their colonies in British America. Printed materials such as magazines, legal documents, newspapers had to be produced on stamped paper made in London that carried an embossed revenue stamp. The tax had to be paid in valid British currency, not in Colonial paper money, and its purpose was to help pay for the British troops stationed in America.

Earlier this year I had the thrill of catching one of Prince’s concerts at the Los Angeles Forum. It was the last of the string of concerts he played there, one of 21 I believe. Or was it 68? For all I know he’s still there playing, jumping around on his platforms and two replaced hips. Whatever, it was an amazing night, a truly kick-ass, loud, crazy, hysterical night where we partied like it was 1999.
Omens are another way Messenger Angels relay messages to humans on Earth. In fact, omens may very well be the most common way of doing so. If you think about the Biblical scripture you will remember that in the very first book of Genesis it says that “there shall be signs in the Sun, Moon, and stars.” Omens are signs; omens are portents. Since these scriptures date back thousands of years it is fair to say that signs have become a familiar thing, especially among the ancient peoples. They looked to signs to predict the weather, to predict the success of crops, to predict famine, war, and other monumental human events. People have long paid attention to signs and omens. When a sign appears in the heavens it does not appear to one race or nation, but is seen by the eyes of people worldwide.
The two categories combined made up 3.64% of total U.S. sales, their highest ever monthly market share, Ward’s AutoInfoBank said. The previous high was 3.56% in July 2009, when the Cash for Clunkers program encouraged people to trade in old gas guzzlers for more fuel-efficient cars.

Unfortunately, the past decade's explosion of self-publishing and small press publishing options has created a similar explosion of opportunistic enterprises designed to exploit writers' struggle for discoverability in an increasingly crowded and chaotic market. One of the challenges of vetting PR services these days is figuring out whether they are real services, or just cynical attempts to cash in on a trend.

I mean, think about it. Did these women ever consider that if we stopped beating up on one another and banded together we might, oh, I don’t know, finally achieve parity in the Congress? Just sayin’.
And now for the cake part. This is a delicious cake and it's my comfort food for days, when I take exams and realize that I'll fail them. I could also eat it every single day. I buy it in the supermarket and it's really cheap, compared to other cakes (less than 2 € for a piece). Last year, when I discovered it, I could only eat a half of it in one sitting, but now I can devour it whole, by myself. I can't even wait until after lunch, I usually just eat it while I'm cooking.
An example of this is that yesterday morning I stood at the kitchen window for 20 minutes (while washing up) watching a blue tit pulling moss from the lawn, presumably to line the nest. Frustratingly although it returned 9 times to collect moss, each time I tried to take a photograph, it flew off. The resident sparrows were of course more obliging.
Now it was this last point upon which my parents disagreed. My mother had always talked a feminist line but it was a line I considered harsh, unyielding and singularly implicated in some of the more negative perceptions society had about feminism. And she did NOT want me going to this rally because she worried about "how it would look" and worried that I could be seen as a "communist", even though she herself supported the ERA.
If you want me to understand which of your thoughts go with what reasoning; it helps if you seperate them into paragraphs and make it easier for me to follow.
Flavor: The first sip, after the refreshing cool feel carries waves of a particular hop tang. The second sip brings out a scorched sugar flavor that slides into a more mellow brown sugar flavor. The third swallow leaves the flavor receptors looking for anything sweet to settle down the rugged spikes of hop tang.
1962 was also the year that many things changed for Charles after graduation. He had extraordinary neurosurgery (in its day) at Duke Hospital to alleviate the involuntary movements of his arms. Charles was seeking in the operation abilities that most men take for granted: shaving, writing letters and preparing meals with out causing harm to ourselves. However, this was not to be, the operation afforded him none of the proficiencies mentioned but an unintended consequence, which contributes to this day to speech impairment.

The center of the eye is mapped to the stomach and digestive organs, with other organs being represented by concentric circular zones moving outward toward the edge of the iris. The bottom of the eye is mapped to the legs and lower half of body. Paired organs (e.g., the kidneys) are mapped to both irises.
You see ever since we came to the UK just after our marriage, a little less than three years ago, we have been planning to travel. It was one of the juiciest carrots my husband dangled to bring me to the UK. He showed me dreams of seeing Europe, not in 15 days but slowly, steadily, a little at a time. Needless to say I fell for it, hook, line and sinker. The first year when he was a full time student and me, sporadically employed, travel was an unthinkable luxury. Second year we were finding our feet, settling in the hectic life of London fresh from the green pastures and slow life of Oxford. But by third year we were ready to travel. Boy, we were raring to go. Some things we decided on--

I wonder when the posters will come down, if they're not already. Why buy Pringles when people are throwing themselves into the sea? A friend of mine's mum did that, but her body had the decency to turn up on the Isle of Man. I hope you show up alive and well. But if not, I hope you show up.
She went on to share how difficult it was to tell her parents.

Some scientists believe that it is theoretically possible that Homo Habilis, and this would be the VERY first hint of the species of Man, and only if you are a person who believed in an Evolution of the Species, were communicating using primitive language-like systems (proto-language), that long ago. Wild, huh?

I loved our trip to MoMa, there is always so much to see on every trip. On the top floor was an exhibition of films that Andy Warhol made during his heyday. It was so quiet and calm, in an odd way, on that floor. The first room was a selection of silent films that Warhol did with Edie Sedgewick, Dennis Hopper, Ginsburg, Sontag, Nico (this sounds like a RENT song), amount many others. He basically just set up a camera on their faces and taped them until the tape ran out. The second room was playing the Warhol film Empire:
Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans reviewed by Liam Jose
Malabrigo - hand dyed, incredibly soft Merino wool? Absolutely!!! Here's another fantastic fiber to add to my collection. I guarantee I'll be using more of it in the future. I still have a nice amount of Cadmium left to dabble with. A scarflet wasn't my initial intent for this yarn, but I wanted a snuggy for my naked neck in this color. Oddly enough I had the perfect buttons for this scarflet and didn't even know it! It was like finding a few bucks in an old jacket pocket - a pleasant surprise! As much as I do love it, I'm not usually found in many bright colors as far as my sweaters go. Anyone who knows me knows that I tend to lean toward the dark side. I thought I would try this for a new cardy design, but it's just a tinge too bold for my personal taste. On another person I'm sure the color would be lovely, but knowing me I wouldn't want to wear it often enough if I ventured down that path...so I went this route.
I don’t post much these days. In part that’s because I have very little to say that is directly relevant to the reason I started this blog. My comic reading has been declining for a while now, and once I finally got around to reading Marvel’s Fear Itself the decline took a sudden, sharp increase. I’ll be honest: Fear Itself was terrible. Certainly there were individual issues that were good (watching Squirrel Girl out kung fu Wolverine being a moment I was particularly fond of) when taken as an aggregate, as an entire narrative arc, dare I say it when viewed as an “event” it was not worth the time it took to read. It was Fear Itself that forced me to unambiguously confront the static nature of mainstream comics; the ways in which they simply recycle what has gone before with what I suspect Terry Pratchett would unflatteringly call a “newish” coat of paint.
Miss Manners thinks the “online boors” should be pitied. (See what I mean?)
If that sounds harsh, let me explain. Zinn was most famous for his polemical “A People’s History of the United States,” which aimed to provide the “true” history from the eyes of the downtrodden people, rather than the prevailing history propagated by elites. What the book boils down to is an argument that evil white men like me have exploited every black, Indian, Chicano, woman, immigrant, Communist, union worker and hippie vegan to ever walk the planet. Okay, so that’s a gross simplification, but it’s no worse than how simplistically “A People’s History” covers American history. Every leftist historical narrative gets its day in this highly political (and boringly simple) book.

The United Kingdom. I especially like the naked mug shots in the beginning. I'm embarrassed to admit how much I liked this performance -- I am, after all, an obsessive Arcade Fire fan for years now, years and years before they won Best Album at the Grammys and everyone was like, "Who the hell is Arcade Fire?" I swear I'm cool, but I liked this man band. I'm feeling defensive now so just watch the video and feel my shame.

Linda Easwood and I have been meeting on Fridays for several months now. Her husband has a different problem. He’s horny enough but he’s got no staying power. She calls him two-stroke because that’s all he’s got in him—two strokes and he’s done with her. She gets the sticky mess without any of the enjoyment that precedes it. She wears long skirts all the time because any amount of leg showing sets him off. “He’ll come in his pants if he doesn’t get them off quick enough,” she says laughing.
Who amongst us never questions their talents? As Artists and Creatives (as well as those who don’t believe they are either)…we are all quite critical of ourselves, our skills, our abilities. One bad day can send us reeling into despair of just how “little” talent we have. Each of us those have a potential image that we aspire to…if we did not, we would not be so critical. Right?!
This term I have been doing three courses. On Thursday evenings I'm doing a 2-year part-time diploma course, on alternate Monday evenings I'm doing an online course and on Friday mornings I'm doing another course. This equates to five 'homeworks' every fortnight, and one 2-3000 word assignment every term, plus working towards a larger portfolio and an exam. That's without actually making uninterrupted space for thinking time. I belong to a writing group, which meet every fortnight. It's my turn to lead the session tomorrow.

So, Kelly clearly doesn’t realize how funny his expression is. He realizes that he’s dropping the more obvious jokes, like a burp or whatever, but he thinks the cherry allergy (above) is just a good detail. But in his R&B recitative, what would be a ludicrous contrivance is hilarious in an ironic way. The whole thing works on this level. If they were put together as plain video shorts, the whole thing might have rang false and too zany to function.

But now I have come to Christ in full acknowledgment that without His gift of mercy and grace, I am in serious distress. I am blessed that my life as a Christian has developed through God’s use of trials and tribulation to bring me to a point of knowing I need Him. Desperately do I need Him. Not only because I desire to spend eternity with Him, but also I cannot make it through the sorrows of this life without his strength. I am a broken man.

This novel is fast paced and action packed. Partridge is being pursued and bugged. For the longest time you aren’t sure who you should trust, and that uncertainty lends credibility to the story. You can believe these are real people because you are never entirely sure of their motivations, and you can’t predict the choices they will make between saving a loved one, or doing what is right.

Last year, Norsigian sold 65 different prints online that he claimed were made from original Ansel Adams glass plates he purchased at a garage sale 10 years ago. The late photographer’s Trust claimed that the plates were not genuine and launched trade mark infringement proceedings against Norsigian in August 2010. According to the Bay Citizen, the Trust asserted “trade mark infringement, trade mark dilution, false advertising and false endorsement, among other charges.”

Although the Holy Family shared a household, the true bond that was the center of their lives, was God. Mary, spouse of the Holy Spirit in all her humility, did everything for God and St. Joseph because of his faith, tasted the harvest along with the rest of us. Meaning, her deep love for God drew her into a deeper humility with every action she performed. Every work of her hand, changing diapers, cleaning, holding the Child, feeding, teaching, came from being obedient to God, and was contributing to the relationship of Spouse of the Holy Spirit.

Killer unicorns? Count me in. Another successful world building story. I loved the whole idea of a group of female warriors training to kill some bad-a unicorns. Everyone thinks Astrid's mom is a wack job, and sure she sounds crazy with her unicorn stories, but then it all comes true. I loved Astrid's cousin, Phil. Yeah she got on my nerves a few times, but for the most part she made me laugh. And Astrid's mom, Lilith, is a piece of work. I can't imagine sending my child to a foreign country with perfect strangers in order fulfill my own selfish desires. There was romance and quite a bit of action. A great read for those looking for something different.

Starting over sucks.When we moved to West Virginia right before my senior year, I'd pretty much resigned myself to thick accents, dodgy internet access, and a whole lot of boring.... until I spotted my hot neighbor, with his looming height and eerie green eyes. Things were looking up. And then he opened his mouth. Daemon is infuriating. Arrogant. Stab-worthy. We do not get along. At all. But when a stranger attacks me and Daemon literally freezes time with a wave of his hand, well, something... unexpected happens. The hot alien living next door marks me. You heard me. Alien. Turns out Daemon and his sister have a galaxy of enemies wanting to steal their abilities, and Daemon's touch has me lit up like the Vegas Strip. The only way I'm getting out of this alive is by sticking close to Daemon until my alien mojo fades. If I don't kill him first, that is.

To be more descriptive, I did not wear a bra or even the slightest resemblance of a training bra under the white tank top because at 11 years of age, my chest was non-existent and the hair on my legs was still pretty much visible to the entire world, yet not something I was conscious about nor gave a second thought to. Shaving was something my Pops did in front of the mirror every morning before putting on his three-piece suit, not something I ever noticed women did. Well, I think my PE teacher in Jr High shaved her face every morning, but I’m pretty sure she was a man. That’s another story. That and that stupid game of Crab Soccer we had to play in PE. Ugh, so effing gross.

Yet, this hour was a bit of a letdown for me. Maybe it was emotionally anticlimactic after all the Addison, Amelia, and Erica drama of recent episodes? Maybe it was because we had two “patients of the week” as opposed to the ongoing stories we’ve become more invested in? Whatever the true reason, let’s go over what did happen this hour.

We had fun looking through his past work, Dennis telling me about how he made the poster, how it was printed, etc. (we've been geeking out on print shop talk now for a while). That Jimi Hendrix poster is a reprint, but Ray Manzarek of the Doors is holding out for an original, if it's still available. (Yes, this is a name-dropping sort of place. But the cool thing is that these artists actually know the musicians, who love their work and inspire more.)

True Grit has some interesting things to say about frontier justice (or injustice) and what I would call “American character.” Those in charge of law enforcement and justice are often unjust and guilty of lawbreaking themselves. Mattie, who puts so much stock in her lawyer’s abilities to protect her family’s property, leaves him out of her search for criminal justice and is only too eager to become a vigilante when it comes to avenging her father’s death. I think that that kind of thinking is widespread today. We are often called a litigious society and we still see today that people with guns are eager to take the law into their own hands (think Trayvon Martin). The resolution to this story and Mattie’s fate made me think of “an eye for an eye” in a very literal way. Mattie makes a physical sacrifice and seems to have no regrets about any of her actions.

Spring has been beautiful, and as every year, it opens in me a small door of plant-longing; a kind of yearning to learn the true names amongst the walls of unknown green along our lanes. And this year I've taken that longing and begun to follow it. For years I've learnt the wayside plants in a haphazard way, my knowledge full of gaps; but now I take my copy of Roger Philips' Wild Flowers of Britain, a notebook and a thermos, and follow where the hedge leads.

There’s a reason for the inconsistency of these accounts: shariah scholar payments don’t have to be made public.

And when Daniel Finkelstein and Tim Montgomerie compose their apologies for ‘gay marriage’ being a fundamentally conservative pursuit, it is evident that they are not merely content to set aside the traditions of their own Jewish and Judaeo-Christian worldviews; they elevate their subjective feelings on the matter to a place above nature and reason. They appear not to be familiar with the philosophical writings of Scruton, let alone Burke, who observed that while society is organic, change must be evolutionary, not revolutionary; consonant with social mores and sensitive to national traditions.

Earlier this season I watched Hewitt pull a muscle running in a minor league spring training game. Then I saw him line a base hit up the middle in an extended spring training rehab assignment. After going one for 20 after being activated on the Thresher’s roster, Hewitt finally broke out in this game against the Brevard County Manatees. He used the whole field by taking advantage of the 25 mph wind blowing to right to line a three run homer in the 3th inning that easily cleared the second fence down the right field line. Then in the fifth inning he grounded a double just inside the third base line for his first two extra base hits of the season.

This kind of change isn’t that easy, especially as many of our destructive habits have their roots deep in our psychology. Spending, eating, and substance addictions are often just responses to deeper emotional issues – stress, pain, loneliness, unhappiness, and perceived powerlessness. It’s when we face up to these and look for deeper and more healthy ways of fulfilling them that the need for these other things can just drop away.
The verdict? These are pretty darn good. Especially considering the lack of unhealthy ingredients. They are definitely best when consumed straight out of the oven (as opposed to sitting under an ice pack for 2 hours, which is how I ate my second breakfast cookie). I think they would be even more delicious with little chunks of apple thrown in. I think the applesauce flavor made me long for real apple bits. I dig apples.

Two of the most watched pieces of litigation surrounding the District of Columbia's relatively new anti-SLAPP law could merge if Washington attorney and political strategist Lanny Davis gets his way.

Here is a sample of Perry singing "It's Beginning to Look A Lot Like Christmas"
The circumstances that led to a ‘Twitter ball’ in Singhvi’s name, was the leak of an alleged porn tape, with spotlights on the sexually consenting duo. However media treated the matter rather insipidly, with brief mentions tucked away in some remote section. The inevitable ingredient when it came to covering any such instance was conspicuously missing: sensationalism. Yes, the very same sensationalism that took Nityananda to an eternal ‘Hall of Notoriety’.

More to come on the book and the blog but I just wanted to reach out to my readers to tell them I’m back.
I'm pretty sure God has great things in store for us. We just have to just shut up and listen.
To begin to fulfil their wish, I mounted my latest and current favourite painting on to some lovely paper and then simply framed it:
Alongside the beers will be the culinary art of Chef Matt Merrick which he has crafted to match the flavours, aromas, bitterness and texture of each brew. Diners will experience the remarkable ability of the malted beverage to compliment or contrast the flavours and tastes of the dishes with the malt, the yeast or the hops or to cut through the richness and refresh with its bitterness.
I am a huge reader and feed my habit with part-time work at the Book House, a used bookstore in Dinkytown, and Mayday Books, a non-profit, all-volunteer bookstore on the West Bank. I’m also involved in various grassroots activities hoping to make the world a better place.
This is the exact lie that got us all into this mess of a world I’m stuck next to you in: “You said in your heart, ‘I will ascend to heaven. I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the heights of the sacred mountain. I will make myself like the Most High.” ~Isaiah 14:13-14God doesn’t dwell inside me, and he never will. I’m no God, and if there is anything I’ve learned this last year, it’s that the answers to my many problems in life are not found inside of myself. When I look back at everything that has worked in my cancer battle: Poly-MVA, juicing/coffee enemas, as well as Clark, Hamer, and Rife research, I realize that I discovered none of this. I was providentially led to all of this, and I have no doubts that I’ll be led to a way out of my seizure situation.
One of Elvis' biggest hits was "Jailhouse Rock." A portion of the song went, "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square. If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair." In the early 90s, a "gangsta rapper" calling himself "Ice T" gave us a song called "Cop Killer" in which some of the lyrics went, "I got my twelve gauge sawed off. I got my headlights turned off. I'm 'bout to bust some shots off. I'm 'bout to dust some cops off."

A great season opener. Bruce Campbell remains my delight. It’s really great that each season they’re capable of finishing on such a high note and picking up again on that same intensity.
Ok then. I’d rather you stay safe and unhurt, but if that’s what your really want, you have my permission to risk your life so that you can live it and risk hurt so that you can find pleasure. Because there is good stuff out there too, fun, friends, pleasure, adventure, learning and all kinds of interesting things. Live it up! If that’s what you like., but please do be just a little careful?
Have you ever taken a moment, since elementary school, to recite the alphabet? Have you ever felt the shape of the letters as they roll off your tongue? Have you ever noticed how we cannot name the consonants without also sounding a vowel? Have you noticed that certain letters are actually comprised of the combined sounds of other letters? Have you ever noticed how certain words starting with the same letter have a similar power…Love and Light for example?
So long story short, Rebecca kills him with a knife while pretending to be Sara, imitating a scene from Single White Female as much of the movie has done so far…ew, what are these horror elements doing in my teen comedy? That's just grotesque and not funny at all.
After his night hours, Tom Moore visits schools and gives pupils cooking classes, showing how to use local products, because he has also been a chef for 20 years… He was at the head of the much awarded “Sage” restaurant in Canberra and then “Grazing”, a farm-restaurant, where he, with his team, grew the vegetables and herbs used in the kitchen. For that also, he won awards, including one for his contribution to a more sustainable planet. Look at his Facebook page and you get the picture of the character: he sits in the meadow cuddling happy pigs.
Rolled Stockings is a romantic drama set among carousing college students. It was one of a number of similarly-themed films aimed toward the youth market. To add a bit of verisimilitude, Rolled Stockings was filmed largely on and around the campus at the University of California, Berkeley. Local papers of the time reported on the arrival and activities of the film crew and cast.
“The barn is in fire,” Hermel reported.
A Preparation for Death is a memoir of a few years in Greg Baxter’s life: let’s say the mid-2000s, though it’s hard to follow the chronology precisely, and anyway he swoops back into previous generations now and then. It’s an account of the years that led to and from the breakdown of his marriage and the breakdown of his ambition to be a novelist; when “no thought I had was quiet. Everything was a military march.”
It was very pretty............ there are some days where I wish so much my Grand Mother was still here so I could talk crochet with her...

All in all, we had a great time. We (i.e. Mom) cooked out at the camper at night. We took in the fireworks on the 4th from the beach! Can't wait til next time!
So... I really intend on updating this blog more than I actually do, but life is busy! And reading to my kids is more important right. Anyway, since I don't post often you should know that EVERY post is important! :)
There are two stories in the Bible that have fascinated me all my life. The first is a parable that Jesus told. It is the story of a merchant who found an extremely valuable pearl. After finding this magnificent pearl, he went and sold everything he had to purchase it. I was always taught that the pearl was the kingdom for God and that when we find this great pearl, we must give up everything to purchase this great pearl. I wanted to be like that wise merchant and give everything to the Lord.
The first was a disturbing column by Nicholas Kristof revealing to the public what research scientists have known for a while: the skyrocketing rates of PTSD and suicide among young veterans returning from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are due not to mental instability, but to the physical effects of repeated exposure to shock waves caused by bomb detonations.

While I was in my own world, the door opened. An intruder into the me-myself moments. Grrr…I sighed and looked upon to find short, stout elderly lady in her 60 something walking inside. The way she wore her sari, I could easily make out that she is a patti from Chennai. “I am from tamil nadu”,was written on her forehead.
So we've spent the first bit of February adjusting to the whole idea of having a child with food sensitivity in the house. Its so, so very weird for us--we usually eat well and clean, but we make a lot of our own baked goods and do eat a lot of wheat. So its been an adjustment. Its hard to eat gluten free on a budget, so we're adjusting there too. Summer has to adjust to not eating some of the things she loves, and we have to adjust by FINDING a way to substitute the things she loves with something similar.

Some women are tough to read and extremely difficult to surprise, so recruit the help of her best mates, sisters or brothers, you can even rope in her family if you have to – it’s extra nice if people she loves can be part of her story.
Overall, this year’s conference was a definite success and i had the opportunity to meet and speak with some of the notable directors, deans, and leaders from well known American and Canadian Universities. When minds work together, amazing things can happen, and by gathering international researchers, consultants, and entrepreneurs in one place, the conference provided ideas and inspiration for individuals to “perfect the blend” in their own institution.

In the last several months, we have visited the ER twice with Ella. Both visits were for the same thing. Croup? Broken bones? Stitches? Nope. Let's just say that my daughter is a pro when it comes to finding, opening, and taking medicine with record speed. Thankfully, everything is okay, no permanent damage done (at least to her).
Later, I lay out sheets of tissue paper and have students choose a color to wrap their mom's gift in. I help them wrap and tape. While I'm helping students wrap, they are also making a gift tag. I cut out small rectangles and put out markers for my kiddos to use. I was afraid they would go way overboard decorating the tags, especially since they were using markers, but they did an excellent job! The tags turned out adorably! After hole-punching the tag, I begin to create a bow (ours were made with yarn). Before I tie it, I add the tag, and wa-la!
I guess the reason for this is because we had no idea where Doug was so the missing person concept added thrill to the story, in the second movie we all had a feeling that Teddy was somewhere close to where they woke up from and that they’d find him in the end anyway.

So there you have it. Some of the main reasons we have sex with you. None of it is rocket science. For us sex goes deeper than just the primal need. Yes, we get horny too, but beyond that we need to know you're there for us, and it starts outside the bedroom.

Vashti: When I moved from North India to KIS, I was exposed to many more areas of study to explore. KIS has much more diverse offerings than most Indian schools. I love music, and have learned to play the saxophone here. The hiking programme has been great for relaxation and for making friends. Rattail Falls was my favorite! I loved taking art and drama. And I would never have believed that I would discover joy in math class!

The real reason I wanted to visit was that Element uses wheat malt from Valley Malt and Four Star Farms (in Northfield) to make their Vernal dunkel wheat wine. “The wheat was grown at Four Star Farms; we also used Snowshoe Farm maple syrup, from Worthington," said Ben. "It works out for us, and it works out for Four Star; they sell to Valley at a better price, and don’t have to sell it off for feed. We only made one batch – it sold out in five days.” Really sold out: none to sample. Too bad, I love a good wheat wine.
I know many people try to resist this notion. But we connect more deeply when we trust others to know more about us, our values, our desires, our fears, our failures, our gifts, our talents, our weaknesses…all of that and more. And the more we reveal of ourselves the more vulnerable we are, the more someone can hurt us. I saw a quote recently. It said “Love is giving someone the power to destroy you…and trusting them not to.” That seems pretty accurate. We so often think about love as what we do for others. But a big part of it is not kind words or loving touch or gifts…it is just being willing to expose our true selves.
So go through and get rid of all the junk you've been saving for a 'rainy day.' Moving into a new place is one of the only chances an adult has to start over, and make a shiny new life for themselves. Go through stuff you have stuck in boxes or around the room and ask yourself if that is something you want to be in your new life. If yes, keep it around. If you're just trying to wait for an excuse to use it or you don't think you'll need it, toss it. This will make packing a lot easier.

Like other Axillary Hyperhidrosis sufferers, the embarrassment of excessive armpit sweating reduces your confidence to a miserable level.

After I abstruse the song, I in actuality started to anticipate aback to the alpha of my agreeable taste. Added than blink-182, Simple Plan, Sum 41, Jimmy Eat Apple and Gob, the songs that consistently bent my absorption were ones from my favourite TV shows. "All Aloft The Nation", "Here We Go" and "Run Around" (From Season 2 of Digimon), and the affair song from Sonic X consistently got me pumped, and eventually helped appearance the songwriter I am today.

In real news, the Salvadoran Civil War starts to get ugly as the FMLN launches a major offensive against the US-backed military government, which, over 1980, murdered nearly 12,000 people, upping it to 16,000 unarmed civilians in 1981. Ulster Defence Association gunmen shoot and wound former MP Bernadette Devlin McAliske. The first DeLorean is made in Dunmurry, Northern Ireland, of interest to fans of lesser time travel narratives, and in one of the great “fuck yous” of international politics Iran releases its American hostages minutes after Ronald Reagan is inaugurated to replace Jimmy Carter.

I know I have said it again and again so I'm sorry if I sound like a broken record. I really want this blog to be real. I don't want to sugar coat my feelings b/c I'm worried about who might read it. There is never any question in my mind that I am more than glad about where we all are right now, but I do have my days and in this instance, my week of struggles. For some reason week 29 was a difficult one and I am quite relieved that we have reached week 30 and I don't have to relive it ever again. I don't know what set me off, but it pushed me over the edge and I had sort of a mini meltdown. I'm not a crier in the least so to push me to the point of tears is not something that happens often.

The doctor said not to get discouraged. He diagnosed Evan with what he calls "Second Child Syndrome." Arabella, being older, is doing all of the talking for him. He gets by with his signs when he wants something, which cuts down on frustration for everyone, but when we ask verbal questions that may or may not apply to both kids, Arabella always has the answer. Therefore Bubba doesn't feel the need to vocalize his opinion because she's already done it for him. I guess part of me realized what she has been doing, but I just let it slide.

What I thought was going to be a nice trip to Joann’s, (yes, I do actually like going to the store) turned into a quite disturbing venture I was absolutely NOT EXPECTING! Who knew Joann’s had such a crude sense of humor, eh? We walked in, and the first thing we saw was this piece of fabric…
Last day in Alaska. Got up fine. It appeared that Venkad with Gaelle and V spent most of the night in the van drinking (at some point a hostel worker asked us to move from the basement kitchen because some late arrivals needed space to sleep). We just had a couple of hours to get last minute souvenirs. We visited the salmon river next to the Ulu factory store. For some reason the salmon run this year was pretty thin. Then visited the market which was quite deserted. Perhaps due to intermittent rain. But worst of all there were no Russian dumplings or pirogi there, at all. There were lots of Asian food and regular fairs. So I just got the GAAR pin (why is that park doesn’t have a magnet?) and some chocolate. That was all.

The Parable of the Three Stone Cutters has been used to teach many fatuous lessons about motivation and management. I have come to assume that the great majority of the fools who write high-minded lessons around the story of the stonecutters have never done anything nearly as brutal as cutting stone in their lives. They are mainly clueless, soft-handed romantics. If they had ever had to put their lily hands on cold stone on a winter’s morning themselves, they would know that it takes something much more intrinsic- like a workman’s pride- or desperate- like a father’s urge to feed his family to keep a man chipping cold rock, breathing stone dust and splitting his raw hands to shape the stone. For those of you unfamiliar with the tale (or who have succeeded in erasing it from your memory) here is a pretty good version of it you can read without being unduly distressed by the moralizing that usually accompanies it.

I've stamped both the flowers and butterfly in Memento Tuxedo Black onto X-press It Blending Card and coloured with Copics (YR20, YR21, YR23, YR24, G40, G82, R81, R83, R85). The flowers were cut out with Large Circle Nestabilities and framed with green cut with MFT's Dainty Doily Die. The butterfly was cut out and offset. Simply added some ivory ribbon, a bow and notched tag using a sentiment from JustRite's Just Because set.
Mr. Edgerton neither ignores nor condones the fact that slavery existed, and acknowledges that some slaveowners greatly abused their slaves; but he points out that some of those slaveowners were black. In other words, contrary to what most of us were taught in school, not all blacks in the antebellum South were mistreated or oppressed.
You can read histories of Jesus and histories of ancient Israel. You can spend years devoting time to Second Temple Judaism, to Josephus and Philo. You can read thousands of books about Jesus written by scholars, pastors and nobodies. You can devote your life to the study and teaching of Christianity, of theology, of biblical studies or exegesis, and no matter your expertise or taste, there is simply no substitute for the four gospels. If you want to know Jesus, and know him as the Church intends him to be known, then your study must begin and end with Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

Despite evidence that Class C misdemeanor ticketing does little to change student behavior, the practice is widespread in our public schools. According to a recent report released by the public interest law center Texas Appleseed, more than 275,000 non-traffic tickets are issued annually to juveniles in Texas. -- many for low-level misbehavior commonly ticketed at school.Appleseed’s research shows that minority and special education students, who are at greatest risk for school dropout, are being ticketed at higher rates for low-level, non-violent offenses. In a recent legislative address, Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice Wallace Jefferson made an important point:
So would it be considered a children's picture book because it meets the page-count criteria, or could it be stretched to the novelty category and submitted to agents that don't accept children's fiction? It seems to me that novelty can be a tough sell, but aren't consumers more likely to purchase a novelty/gift book than, say, a fifteen-dollar picture book? I ask that realizing your answer most likely is that it depends on the pictures, but feel free to surprise me here.It depends on the pictures---and the topic.

‘Supposing truth is a woman– what then? Are there not grounds for the suspicion that all philosophers, insofar as they were dogmatists have been very inexpert…have been awkward and very improper….What is certain is that she has not allowed herself to be won– and today every kind of dogmatism is left standing dispirited and discouraged…Some play on words perhaps…or an audacious generalization of very narrow, very personal, very human, all too human facts.’ This is one of many Nietzschean memes I would like to see spread further, ‘human, all too human…’ From the ‘god’ who wears a beard, to the nature whose ‘laws’ are ‘written’, to the ‘mathematics’ which ‘works’ so well… It seems to me as well that our dogmatic philosophies are thoroughly imbued with ‘human’ concern. Enterprises, instruments, philosophies, etc. which are in an important sense ‘products’ of the primate nervous system appear to bear its genetic heritage under this Nietzschean scrutiny. Here lampooned with an ironic anthropomorphism of the ‘search for truth’ as some sort of postmodern romantic Hollywood farce, N-’s poetry.

I can’t say if the scene below is a dream or a fantasy, but from the bits I could understand from the article’s translation, Siwan and Kim Ye Won are on a picnic date at Hanok Village and dressed up in period costume, obviously. It gets romantic, as the two share a drink at a fountain, a scene drawing a comparison to the modern film adaptation of Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations.
Another new Primark dress! I'm feeling a bit *blogger cliche* in this outfit to be honest, with the lace dress and fur gilet but I do really love the black fur contrasted with the delicate lace. Wore this today to go out for Sunday lunch with my parents and some family in Coventry and the tie things on the gilet broke! Luckily having my Mum here meant she kindly sewed it back on but I suppose that's the quality I must put up with if I insist on only buying clothes in Primark, haha. I've seen this dress on a couple of other blogs, and it truly is a gem! The lace is a little bit different to those seen on similar dresses and it has buttons all the way down the back, which I adore.

On Thursday I was still having contractions about 10 to 20 minutes apart when I got up in the morning.

Rest assured dear reader, there are ideas galore. Here are five to start you off with:
Initially, at around 8pm the police contact centre sergeant had explained that in light there being of no immediate risks or threats, there was little prospect of police support for ‘several hours’ because of other demands which had to be prioritised. This had led to a further phone call asking to speak to the Duty Inspector who was promptly told by a bed manager that she was under an obligation to send officers to the hospital. She again established that there was no violence, threats or attempts to abscond and explained that there was no prospect of this occurring any time before approximately 11pm, perhaps later. That’s when legislation started to be quoted with an insistence that she was ‘obliged’.
“I guess it was a phase I was going through. I know there were times when I was really nasty and rude to you, and I’m sorry. I think most of those times I was just angry, not angry at you, just an angry kid. And you ended up having to deal with it. And I’m sorry about that. But now I think I’m different. And I don’t know if it had to do with growing up or moving over here or what. I just know that I’m a lot more mature than I was before, and I like it. I’m getting along better with you, and I like that too.” Patti finally smiled following that last part.
Tomorrow we are having Baked Spaghetti Squash with Beef and Veggies. If you have never tried a spaghetti squash, you really should. Don't be afraid. A lot of people like to use it instead of pasta. It doesn't really taste like pasta but when cooked it's in strands, just like spaghetti noodles. I think it's really delicious. I don't plan to serve anything on the side. It looks like a complete meal to me!
Gottlieb’s investigation was almost laughably shoddy. He didn’t request a search warrant for the players’ house until 48 hours after the alleged attack. At his initial interview with Mangum, he failed to take contemporaneous notes. Nearly a week passed before he tracked down the second dancer, Kim Roberts; when he did, she deemed Mangum’s claims a “crock.” And it was weeks (if ever) before Gottlieb obtained statements from the accuser’s recent sexual partners or filled in gaps about her pre-party behavior.

Try the below : Article 3 for details . . .
When middle grade and teen readers hear they are going to read a “classic” for school they usually react in one of two ways. One reaction is: “Oh, no, another irrelevant dusty old tome to dissect and discuss to death.” These often are the students who have done the in depth or interminable studies of one particular book chosen by the teacher or the curriculum department for the class. The other reaction, the one we all hope to hear is: “Yay, I’ve always wanted to read that” or even sometimes “Yay, it’s got to be good since it is a classic.” This reaction comes from students who have been able to read the particular classics that appeal to them. The Count of Monte Cristo and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm will each appeal to different readers. Reading and analyzing Pride and Prejudice may be [i]readicide for a reader who would be captivated by the swashbuckling action of The Three Musketeers or the survival adventure of Treasure Island but might move a different kind of reader, one who is captivated by the manners, mores, and romance of a more formal society to reading Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights.

My only regret is putting it off so long out of fear.
It is heartbreaking to see the successes of teaching being clouded by the struggles and challenges of budget cuts and other means that are undermining the strength of each teacher who IS trying to make a difference.
Kirby had a good, stable weekend. She is recovering very steadily and regaining her normal functions. They are going to try her off the ECMO machine today to see how she responds. If she responds well enough, they want to take her off it completely Tuesday. That will be great!! It's awesome to see all of our prayers being answered day by day. God is working in a mighty way. Kirby is opening her eyes and very aware of her parents around her :). The battle is not over yet, we need to continue to pray for the valves in her heart to stop leaking. This will determine when she can come off the ECMO. This leak problem is also critical to her coming home. So, lets all speak life and healing over the heart valve and command it to stop leaking!
The swelling went down after an hour or so, and I was even good to go for sex the next morning. It also turns out that FigureSkater thought ‘magnum’ was just a type of condom, and didn’t know that they came in different sizes. I suppose next time I will specify.
Similarly we find ourselves in the bowels of the mill. Three people awaken and immediately begin their labors. One must climb to the top of the structure to set the windmill in motion. His heavy wooden shoes make an unbelievable amount of noise as he clambers up a staircase. It is shocking in its clarity. For certain, you’ve never heard anything like it in your lives – either in your personal lives, or your experiences in watching films. Yes it is that memorable that I must make mention.
Not for me. I just didn’t like coffee. Even in college, when I needed a pick-me-up for an all-nighter, I’d walk to a nearby convenience store and pick up a can of (shudder) instant iced tea with artificial lemon flavor. That stuff bore a closer resemblance to battery acid than anything someone would actually drink. But it was caffeinated, and the nasty taste helped keep me awake for a few more hours of cramming for an accounting test.

Toni Kroos began to see more of the game in an attacking role, he kept interchanging with Robben on the right and the Dutchman drifted in to shoot narrowly wide, before Kroos managed to slip to the side of Marcelo who left the right open, and his cross fell for Gomez who was hauled down by Pepe and Robben made it 2-1 from the spot and level at 3-3, but Bayern continued to threaten, Kroos propped up in the attacking-central-midfield position to thread Gomez in to shoot at Iker Casillas’ body, whilst Robben did the same to win a free-kick on the edge of the D, which he saw Casillas beat away.

Plus my laptop broke thanks to Maddux so I can't be in the same room as him and I really need to take nap time for time to prepare lunch, clean, shower, read my bible or workout not to sit on the computer.

#3 A good story engages you in problem solving. Have you read the Dragon Tattoo books? I'm about half-way through the third book and despite the cacophony of similar looking Swedish names they can really draw you into the action. Another recent read of mine, Karen Russell's Swamplandia!, is a tale so simultaneously tall and probable that I found myself teetering on the fence deciding if it was fantasy or not. It's the story of Ava Bigtree, the youngest in a familial line of lady alligator wrestlers and her journey to save her sister from a bad marriage to a ghost. All the while trying to save the family theme park. Every problem lays out an array of possible solutions--some concrete and others vague--begging the reader to help in deciphering the clues and putting the mystery to rest.
But even that analysis is not quite germane to the Hansen assertion regarding the noise of random weather. Figure 3 presents an analysis of the intensity of the variability of daily averaged surface temperature across the United States.
Now I’m a busy mom of twin toddlers. I still love to read and I also love to write. I’m usually reading a couple books at once and working on multiple writing projects too.

Her favorite show is “Dora the Explorer.” Is it wrong that I find myself watching it even after she’s left the room? I mean, I have turned it on, she has left the room almost immediately, and 30 minutes later I begin to blush when I realize I watched the entire episode alone. Anyway, I am learning some valuable lessons from the show, here they are:
My mom is 70+. The obvious applies……however I’ve never had a great family life; so why am I giving a shit now. I’m a prime example that all dogs resemble their owners. That’s why ill probably be alone when I get older.

She had been attacked during that robbery and she was left scarred after that. That was the beginning of her self inflicted scars...
It is a great mystery of the anointing of which one may be unaware—even though it is working most powerfully. On the other hand, one also may not be conscious that it has been lifted! When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, “he was not aware that his face was radiant” (Exod. 34:29).

It's a good question, coloured by Chris' unabashed dislike of what he sees as bandwagon-straddling me-too citra-infused pale golden ales. The short answer to this is, of course, no. But the long answer provides some insight into where the beer world may be headed in the next few years.

Pagliacci accepts the ‘second world’ of the carnivalesque, the schizophrenic ‘reality’ as opposed to what in the film is the mythic ‘first world’.

Back a few years ago a couple of friends of mine wanted to get into the betas of the MMORPGs that were starting to debut. One of them got the idea to stand up a site where we talked about gaming and did gaming reviews. If we were seen legitimately as a gaming review site, then invitations might come our way. I took on the alter ego of Toothpick the Ferret (pictured) who was a semi-malicious prankster. Colorful characters, brutally truthful reviews, and a wide range of content from boardgames to tabletop RPG to consoles to MMORPGs was our formula. It worked. It worked too well. The problem with keeping up with a site like that is you have to have a lot of time to actually play a lot of games. We didn’t. And so after a few months’ foray into the world of doing game reviews, we slowly let the site die.

As I had left the model last time I was having trouble inserting the upper floor windows into the wall. I’m not sure what the issue was but having tried testing the window shape on another area of the building and it working fine I realiased that the issue must have been with the wall. So I just copied the floor below again and moved it into the right position so now I have all the 3 windows inserted into the wall.

One of the most common complaints of the N64 was that the unit's audio process wasn't on the same level as that of the PlayStaion or Saturn. Nintendo's decision to stick with the cartridge format when everyone else was moving to CDs came back to bite the video game giant in more ways than one. Even so, in the right hands (or in this case, ears) composers proved that quality sound on Nintendo's last cartridge-based console was not impossible. Some of my favorite video game songs are from The Big N's 64 bit baby, and not just from first and second party titles.
I am sure that the grumpiness about the Games will disappear as they approach, and people will be swept up about the enthusiasm. It will be fun. It will be great for the UK, and all the nasty swipes at the organisers not being ready will hopefully fade out as the time grows closer. At least, I hope so. Yes, it is an expense. Yes it will play havoc with the traffic. Yes yes yes there will be lots of inconveniences.

On the same night the Mets went down to Georgia and won their seventh game of the season out of ten played so far, Dillon Gee became the Mets' first starting pitcher to conquer the seventh inning. He successfully negotiated a seven inning win unlike any Met pitcher has so far this season. And no, I'm not trying to overstate that. But it's nice to discuss all the same.
I would like to be friends again, but I also know that we'll never be close like we use to be. Since the day she moved out and the distance between us has grown, I'm happier.

Sometimes “comfort food” feels right. Don’t make any food right or wrong for you. Use your guidance to know what you need at any given moment.

The philosophy of business also deals with questions such as what, if any, are the social responsibilities of a business; business management theory; theories of individualism vs. collectivism; free will among participants in the marketplace; the role of self interest; invisible hand theories; the requirements of social justice; and natural rights, especially property rights, in relation to the business enterprise.
Ahem. It has taken me three days to make two cards. Really. I am not sure why I have been so conflicted on the design for them. I tried so many combinations that I was sick of it. Sick of it.

I hope the girls are happy with them.

If you have lost a child, you already know what a "Rainbow" is.... it is the name for the child that is born after the child you lost. Your "Rainbow Baby" is a symbol that God has healed your heart enough to open it up to love again, that God has been true to the covenant... that He has not let 'the flood' destroy you.
We know these truths, but can never proclaim them loudly, because it makes us too real. How can we be Christians if we admit those horrible things? Doesn’t that make us like the world? Aren’t we supposed to not be like the world?

From the beginning, the book and the museum were linked in his mind. Already in 1999 he bought the building. As he wrote he collected, or rather vice versa: as he collected little objects from junk shops in its neighborhood, from family and friends, he put them in his novel. ‘It wasn’t difficult to find lotto tickets, or bottle caps, or match boxes, because people collect these,’ Pamuk told us. ‘But who collected the toothbrushes the people of Istanbul used in those days? I complained about this in an interview and then a dear reader sent his collection to me.’

I have also been working with a friend from church on our mission in your name. I am really excited about it and we are going to present it to the congregation on your birthday. I’ll be sure to tell you all about how it goes and what’s behind all of it! I’ve packed pretty much everything for our hospital trip and prepared your little sister’s nursery this week too.

My midwife came to see me today, and now we begin prenatal visits every two weeks, until, I believe, 36 weeks, at which point our visits will be weekly for the duration. Only a few more weeks before she brings the birth pool over to have on hand; only a few more weeks until Michael and I will need to rearrange our bedroom to make room first for the birth pool, and then a changing table and cradle. Holy shit. It blows my mind when I think about the fact that within just a few weeks – less time than it’s been since my ultrasound when we learned we’ll be adding another girl to the mix, which seems like yesterday – I’ll be holding this little bundle in my arms. And then I wax teary and emotional, imagining her entrance into the world and into our family, our eyes meeting for the first time, feeling her weight and warmth against my body rather than inside . . . What will she look like? Dark wavy wisps of hair and dark eyes like Joey, the twins, and Lilah? Or blonde and fair like Kevin and Finn? Or something altogether different? What I do know is that I will look into her eyes and know that I know her already.

One of the powerful things about article marketing, especially if you are building a list, is that subscribers who come to you after reading one of your articles tend to buy more than subscribers who come to you from many other traffic sources. Generally, when someone subscribes to your list after reading one or several of your articles, they already are beginning to trust you, and might buy from you sooner than someone who needs to read several emails from you and perhaps communicate online before they will purchase. Article writing simply provides a unique opportunity for you too attract subscribers to your list who have a prequalified interest and trust in you.

We were trying out our act in various places in Greenwich Village. Monday night was usually talent night at such clubs as The Duplex, The Bitter End and The Champagne Gallery. The owner of The Champagne Gallery liked our act and asked us if we would play in her club for the month of July 1967. Then on the night of July 31, Bill Downer from Northern Publishing saw these two bobbing blond heads from the window of the club and came in. It was his secretary’s birthday, and they just happened to be strolling by after dinner. We were at the right place at the right time.

JJ: B-A-T-U-M-A-N. The first name is E-L-I-F. She’s a Turkish-American woman. She published a book last year, from the same series that Pulphead is in, about Russian writers; her encounters with and studies of different Russian writers. She also wrote a piece, several years ago, for the magazine N Plus One. It was a review of a Best American Short Stories collection. She got at some problems of contemporary American prose (tonal, technical problems that are indicative of deeper things), and did it with a microscope, in a way that is rare.
Released in 1992 in the midst of the grunge feeding frenzy, Increasing Our High bears only the faintest whiffs of that era. The best songs sound as timeless as the bands that seem to have inspired Vasquez, such as The Kinks and The Sonics. The Pacific Northwest had always been a hotbed of garage music, but at that time, a so-called neo-garage revival was sweeping through the global music underworld. The charge was initially led by The Gories, and although the revival spawned tons of cookie-cutter, backward-looking bands with pageboy haircuts and formulaic tunes, it also birthed now legendary bands such as The Mummies, The Trashwomen and Supercharger, bands who turned the vintage sound into something completely unique and far more inventive than simple retro posturing. It’s with the Gories and Mummies that Vasquez’s Night Kings most closely fit, albeit still loosely. Despite his obvious influences, Vasquez wasn’t drawing from the all too familiar Nuggets and Pebbles wells to scavenge paisley sounds to meticulously recreate. He was someone for whom ’60s rock riffs best fit his fury. His Night Kings songs “Black Fluid,” “Dirty Work,” “Death,” “Black and White,” “Bum” and “Complaint Dept” are frenzied, infectiously catchy, and, despite their relative simplicity, have tons more personality than most of the songs that derivative garage dress-up bands such as The Fuzztones and The Lyres produced. If Vasquez’s anger and punk root-stock weren’t enough to earn his music wide recognition, then at least these elements colored his music with enough originality to distinguish it from the garage revival pack.

I could smoke but it probably isn’t a good idea I could even drink but again not a good idea. I’ve noticed as I’ve gotten older that I have extremely poor tolerance of boredom. That’s really not a good thing. I could grab a doobie and watch television for hours if I were stoned but alas I’m not. There really isn’t much to do at all. Saying that, last week I watched a documentary about China and the surrounding area. The show focused on nature mainly. Since I was 6 I’ve enjoyed nature documentaries, mainly by David Attenborough. I especially loved his Blue planet series. This is an example of decent television. Not soaps like Eastenders, Big brother or Britain lacks talent.

Other than a handful of the elite who run the SLPI and their various institutions, it is not surprising that even private media groups are suspicious. This is why the Leader Publications are not members. This is why another newly emerged private group flatly refused to join the Brahmins. Their owner said that one of the elitist members had canvassed and even bribed newspaper venders not to sell his publications when they came into the market. They now have a foothold and have been invited. The publisher has said that he would, in time to come, expose the hypocrisy of the elite group and their activities. Kroners not only help lead good lives, but also provides a platform for disinformation. That is press freedom on a World Press Freedom Day.
In the eons since its forging, the knowledge to create or destroy such items was found, lost, regained, and finally fled forever. Unbreakable, able to cleave any substance, and poisoned by time immemorial, its smallest cut slew the living. If annals of its deeds survived, they would tell the story of a million year old sword wielded by murderers, thieves, kings, and despots. In its time, the sword helped save the world, and helped cast it down, before its square-edged hilt found its way into Princess Sharia’s hand.

I was worshipping at a friend’s church in Lagos Nigeria, last Sunday. My friend was the one who delivered the sermon and as part of his message he was raising a lot of songs and hymns that really blessed me.

Today I want to share a quick and easy DIY clothespin wreath idea with you. We have an event coming up in the next few weeks (will share more as the time passes but since it includes some surprises...I am keeping my lips sealed for now!) and I wanted a way to display photos without framing a bunch of pictures. Frames would cost money and space to set them all up.

Coincidentally, April’s Opening Times column – submitted well before the government announcement – is on the subject of minimum pricing. I wasn’t tipped off by a mole, honest. Have a read and leave a comment.
Such a true statement about abstract art! It is NOT easy to get abstract art "right," no matter that many people feel that it's elementary and easy. I often feel that it is 100 times easier to draw a sketch of a person or an object with accuracy than to do a painting like this. I think one of the hardest things is knowing when to stop...knowing when to let negative space be negative space, and when to add color or movement. I will sometimes paint a hundred paintings "under" a painting, in order to get the right look or feel. I should probably make a stop-motion video of the process of painting a canvas like this. So many layers involved!
A few months back I got a new overhead projector to help me block in some of the stuff I paint. Basically, I use the overhead projector like this: 1) I draw something. 2) then I take it to the photocopier store and get the drawing xeroxed onto a piece of clear film. 3) then I eat a sandwich. 4) then I take the image and with the overhead projector trace the drawing onto a canvas 5) then I paint the picture. 9 out of 11 times the painting comes out as good as the original drawing.
Store circulars and magazines. Occasionally, coupons will appear in publications within a supermarket or drugstore, probably by the door or the cashier. Though you’ve already made your plan, leaf through these, since they can offer good last-minute deals or bargains for next time.
However, I'm really missing these things at the moment. I'll be sure to enjoy them and not take them for granted once I can have them again. Here are the few I'm particularly looking forward to:

—Tops and Bottoms, retold and illustrated by Janet Stevens; won a Caldecott Honor book in 1996—a tale derived from Europe and the American South, in which clever Hare tricks lazy Bear not once, but twice, each time splitting the crops they have planted and harvested together (with Hare and his family doing all of the work).

I can totally be repulsed by their jacked-up actions, though.
On my way to the studio I thought of “Hanna” – a movie I have recently obsessed about (a masterpiece of 4 skills!). I thought I saw a couple of shots where the DP used some kind of lensbaby. Dreamlike and slightly disturbing close-ups of Hanna being disturbed a out of a dream. I couldn’t wait to shoot.

After being back in the newsroom for roughly 2 minutes Bureau Chief Andy decided to send Carissa and me back out to road works drama on Kings Road that they’d been following on the scanner. Once we got there we discovered a section of road works wasn’t laid down properly and had started coming off the road and attaching to the wheels of cars driving over it faster than about 25km/h. From what I could see there wasn’t many road works signs were up either, so cars going through at first weren’t bothering to slow down and be cautious. Cars lined both sides of the road and people were everywhere; heaps of workmen were attending to cars trying to scrap some of the tar off.
Without further ado, I would like to introduce you to Shaunna Rodriguez.
I fear that things will never change and that I will just be living in this house forever and watching everyone around me grow- including my boyfriend who is getting promoted like crazy all the time at his corporate bank job. I'm so proud of him, but if I can't contribute it might be a while until we move out. And I don't want to get to an age where I have to chose between a career and being a mother. If I have kids before I've established an identity for myself in a career, I will always feel a little incomplete.
Keep you weapon on you at all times... wear your helmet and flak ...saying cheese with your MU mug... does not make me feel safe!
Before the commercials started, Christina Milian caught up with Jamar and Juliet backstage and asked if there was anything they wanted to say anything to each other. Juliet almost broke down right there. And that caused me to be okay if Jamar gets voted off. Because she has done really well throughout this competition and ROCKED THE FUCKING HOUSE last night. And she deserves this chance like anyone else. And her breaking down reminded me when I broke down crying backstage in front of Rebecca Loebe before my Battle Round against Nakia from all of the anxiousness.
Being a Vegan is about so much more than just what I eat or wear or buy. I got involved in trying to spread the compassionate message, attending protests, Veggie Pride Parades, Vegan cooking competitions and fundraising activities. I met other Vegans through groups on the Internet. I visited farm sanctuaries where I could see with my own eyes the innocent lives that represented the billions that are invisible to most of us. Through Veganism I found a new purpose and used my voice to help bring change.

Largo (Tomer Sisley) is the secret, adoptive son of Nerio Winch (Miki Manojlovic), a powerful billionaire who is murdered in the film's early going. Financed and mentored by his father, Largo is pulled from his world as a thrill-seeking adventurer (whose exploits lead him into fights, beds and jail cells) and thrust into the role of running the powerful W Corporation, of which he now controls majority share. More interested with flushing out his father's killer than running shareholder meetings, the charismatic and resourceful Largo fights hostile takeover bids and even more hostile assassination attempts while relying on board members, security personnel, a butler, driver/bodyguard, secretary and others who may or may not be what they seem.

* - So while it may be less of a foodie ingredient, I've found a cottage cheese that I love and I think it offers a great alternative to ricotta. But ricotta sounds a little more upscale so it's in the title. But if you are cottage cheese-phobic (as I once was), you should know that the Michigan Brand cottage cheese is great with a nice sharp flavor and not at all watery. We eat it with corn chips, mix it with eggs, bake it into quiches, etc. etc. Give it a try, you won't even notice a cottage cheese texture in this.
I have been missing you lately. There isn't a minute that goes by that I don't think about you, but lately it is more than that. It's the time of year, I think. These months of fall were so heavy with hope and excitement over your existence. You, this tiny little spark in my belly, changing the way my world turned. At the end of October, we saw you on the ultrasound screen and I finally allowed myself to fall totally in love with you, even though in my heart I felt that something wasn't right. Thanksgiving brought a table full of family, giddy with anticipation and twinkle-eyed imaginations of how different the next year's feast would be.

I lay in the dark listening to the sound-asleep breathing of Big Puppy who had settled in nicely on floor, and I marveled at the differences in my two children. One expounds on thoughtful subjects, and a few thousand miles away, the other simultaneously curses the cursor. They have always been that way—complete opposites in their approach to the world around them. We used to joke that when the four of us would be walking down the street, No. 1 would walk ahead with Husband and proceed with purpose, and Eustacia and I would lag behind looking at the pretty colors or whatever. That’s a gross simplification of the truth, as most jokes are, but it represented the general difference.

Surname-distribution maps are great aids to determining immigrant origins. They work particularly well for studies of less-common surnames and in countries that did not use patronymics. United States researchers should remember to search for variant surname spellings, especially for those with European ancestors whose surnames were Anglicized in America. If immigrants arrived in family units, identifying places where both the father and mother’s surnames were prevalent, provides valuable clues about their origins.

...I stepped out on a limb and made a video to submit for the SOAR scholarship. Thanks to some great friends, Mike and Robin Parma, I had learned about the program a few months before and had been eagerly awaiting the application notification, checking the SOAR website randomly. Somehow, I found out about it when there were only six days left to apply. Once I realized the application process was open, my mind was blank. I could not come up with the words to say to express my need for confidence. Or my desire to change an aspect of my life that was not right.
The day we bombed Afghanistan was my twentieth birthday. I remember being called in to work for a night shift because a co-worker was sick, and dragging my feet. I had just made the world's deadliest margarita (you can drink in Italy at 18, so yes, it was legal!), and hated the thought of going in for yet another twelve hour shift. I thought what we were doing in Afghanistan was right, righteous, and beyond reproach. Even as the War on Terror extended beyond Afghanistan's borders--as the Patriot Act was passed and the Iraq war started--I believed we were doing the right thing.

It was another choppy session for Indian Stock Markets, which lead markets to close in red with substantial losses. Nifty witnessed selling pressure for second consecutive day. Nifty has important support zone in 5,300-5,270 zone. If Nifty manages to hold this zone the recovery may be seen else selling pressure may be continuing. On upside, Nifty has resistance in 5,400-5,450 zone.

So, not to rub it in for you northern folk, but spring has sprung here in North Carolina. ahhhhhh, bliss. We've got a crop of daffodils coming up and the hellebore are in full flower. We're dreaming up a new vegetable garden and planning new flower beds.
We started chopping corn Monday afternoon of last week on a little 2.5 acre patch near the dairy. The "warm-up" allowed us to see what equipment adjustments were needed before we moved into the creek bottom and started chopping the rest of the corn on Tuesday. We didn't get much of a run on moving day thanks to a slow start and a braking issue with our dump truck, but we successfully chopped roughly 250 tons of silage over the next two days. We should have filled our first silage bunker up on Friday, but several mechanical issues derailed us before lunchtime. We resumed harvesting this Monday, and by late afternoon we had finally chopped enough silage to fill our first bunker.
Jeanne planned this cruise to be her biggest and grandest voyage ever. She truly wanted to spend time with her Quacker friends on the most spectacular ship ever built. In her eyes, Jeanne always felt the cruises were about all of you and not about her. This was not an ego trip for her, but a way to have Quackers meet other Quackers and form friendships that would last a lifetime. She was proud that her trips were like no other cruises, just as her Quackers were like no others.
I’ve had a crazy past few weeks. School started last Monday for USF students, and before that I was in Tuxtla, Mexico on a mission trip with 12 people from Aletheia Tampa. We helped some amazing church planters down there and got to meet some truly awesome Mexican college students. Needless to say, I’ve been on-the-go non-stop for a while which has resulted in a lack of sleep (and Allie is not nice to be around when sleep-deprived- be warned!).
In the distance, the Santa Susanas Mountains were splattered across the land like Martian Marbles. And below, sitting in the shadow of the Western sunset and the dusty pink rocks, was a symmetric white house, in bleached stucco. Its façade was punched with a row of rectangular wood windows, some broken, some without panes. A pitched shingle roof and hanging iron candelabras illuminated a long, Saltillo tile- paved porch.

I just wonder what my previous post was all about - the importance of sitting with a dying person. I feel used. I'm sure I was a great comfort to my husband but at what cost? Would I have done it had I known what I know now? I just feel so used.
The December 1982 edition of the Soviet journal, World Marxist Review, stated: "The national liberation movement in South African owes its present scope and clarity of purpose to our party's tireless activity in the organisation's political and ideological structures." Slovo himself admitted the parasitical relationship when he said in Angola in 1985 that his communist revolution could "only be won under the banner of the ANC."
I was invited to his launch party this evening and I have to say, the man seriously knows how to throw a kosher rumpus — invite Borscht Belt King and Friar’s Club dean Freddie Roman as master of ceremonies, attempt to feed some of the hungriest fressers in the city with enough cholesterol and saturated fat to kill a rogue elephant, and get Jewish Elvis to entertain the masses. Now THAT my friends is a party.
There are also a fair amount of poems that allude to other literary and extra-literary sources. Eliot wrote that there are two types of allusion – extensive and intensive – and to the extent that I hope such allusions are extensive, the process of comparison (between the allusion and the alluded to) seems to me as much part of the poems as the words they contain.

Last summer I received an e-mail from a lady at our church forwarding information on a job she thought I might like to apply for. I was very interested and I did. In fact, I've never wanted another job as bad as I wanted that one. I was a finalist for the position but in the end the contract was offered to another.

My wild, rebellious phase continued. I was even taken to a counsellor and a psychologist, where I discussed my feelings and what was going on in my life. The psychologist did not think I was problematic and seemed to suggest that it was my Dad who was far too over-protective. As you can imagine, he was not very impressed to hear this.
Here's a short video (less than 2 mins) of the Festival from the foodie perspective. It's in French but I think it captures the atmosphere perfectly.

When we got there they opened their home to us and we stayed with them several weeks while we looked for a place to live. Sieg was working in the field and I was due to have another baby within a few weeks. Tora was also expecting so poor Jay had two pregnant ladies and four preschoolers underfoot. I am sure it was a trial but there was never any discord and I still have wonderful memories of staying there. (Even if Jay was worried that I would go into labor and Sieg would not get there in time. lol )

There was Miso Sake Black Cod tacos, with incredibly fresh, tender, flaky fish on amazing little flour tortillas (my fav). And the Hoisin Duck Confit taco. And salsas with Asian-inspired flavors. It may look like street food, but it tastes like fine dining - ingredients are all top quality. That's not all, the tacos are all served with free chips with wasabi guacamole and pickled shishito peppers.
Try telling them it isn't necessary, stop fiddling with what isn't broken. Ah, but you know you cannot argue with machines armed with computer generated stats promising profit for economic innovation. Have you ever tried to contact blogger for tech support? Where are the people, the human beings wearing ear pieces and mouth mics, to fix your foibles? We shouldn't wonder what happened to the human personality that used to be so gracious. Once autobots replaced the human being your query into tech support in ANY situation no longer encouraged or required courtesy. Once you figured out you could pay your bills by cellphone, online or just by authorizing creditors to trawl your bank account, you didn't have to write legibly either. Mostly we learned to check boxes and copy/paste the rest. How encouraging are conversations with other voices where you respond with only "yes" or "no" and hang up on them? Every one of us is at least guilty of that. That is what they want. These antisocial actions only create more of the same antisocial behaviors. If we are willing to cooperate this much, how much more will we cooperate with before signing out for the last time? Are we even close? Remotely close? Some will be more than happy to go away and do something else, something real, something that does not lead to ennui. Believe it or not, there is still a beautiful world out there, we will never find it the longer we stay glued to this unnatural relationship.
So why are they on the list then? Well, simply because it’s been ages (nearly two years) since the Dorothy madness and there’s no prospect of another show of this type coming up soon.
These cooking and baking goals are hopefully going to be accomplished by my 25th birthday! If not, at least during my 25th year... Here's to much learning and new challenges in the new year!
I made the Cabbage Roses with the Tim Holtz die, some embossing, and loaded with awesome Lindy's sprays for a beautiful shimmer and shine as well as the I Am Roses mixed in amongst 'em. I added some awesome trims and a lil' vintage white birdie that has lots of worn and a shabby loved look.
With Love & Revolution, it’s fair to say that Conte, a guitarist who almost never dominates and a musician that often doesn’t even participate, comes into his own as a composer and conceptualist. It’s a mature work that is more cohesive, satisfying and unique than just about anything Conte has attempted before. A hippy dippy vibe prevails here, as suggested by the retro cover graphics, recalling some of the Impulse work of Dave Mackay and Vicky Hamilton, whose “Here” is heard here. But that’s more a superficial catch-all than what this music is all about.
Breathless Press and one other party offered on my manuscript. Two out of forty something wasn’t bad for a first try! I thank my editor Jackie Moore for seeing potential in my first draft and working with me to make my piece the best it can be. Crimson & Steel was released on October 14th. It is my first published work of any kind. Set in the Noricum province of ancient Rome, it follows the lives of two girls. One is a trained pleasure slave from the eastern desert, the other a naïve Germanic servant. A second part entitled Scarlet Sands will be released on a date yet to be determined.

All I needed to buy was a $4 bottle of apple cider vinegar, and we are in business! I funneled the vinegar into the other bottle, and it works perfect as a squeeze bottle. The first time I tried this, Logan was shocked at having something squirted into his ear with such volume and speed. He shook his head back and forth, and ear wax actually flew out in mass amounts, so it was definitely successful in breaking it up. If your dog doesn’t like the idea of squirting, you may want to assign a wash cloth just for him and apply the solution to the cloth before working it in.
IDI – Hi Julianne, I’m happy you could join me here today.
Now, for those of you who have read my articles before, you know that I’m not one to leave well enough alone. That’s to say, I dabble in plenty of corn cuisine. After all, when you take something really sweet and add it to your favorite recipes, the end result is, well, sweeter! Corn chowder is a good example of this. Phyllis Kirigin has offered her most excellent recipe below, and I strongly suggest you try it. It’s delicious.
Av is home with us and he has plans for the year so its going to fun. J has started talking in sentences which amazes me since it seems to have happened to so quickly. He likes to copy Av saying things like "That doesn't make 'ense". At 40 months breastfeeding at least once a day.
None of this–none of it–means we are weak or stupid. At least no more so than any other higher primate who just wants to fit in with the tribe so we can get our needs met. Wanting to break down the structures that get us to harm ourselves and others isn’t wanting to limit the choices of others under the idea that they’re too stupid to direct their own lives. It’s wanting to ensure that all of us have a full range of choices that are truly available, and not just the limited binary we’re given to make us think we have some control.
The foregoing study fell into the well-known mould of correlating pencil-and-paper personality measures. This alone will obviously not suffice. We also want to know whether our new personality measure (the moralism scale) is related to actual behaviour of a politically radical kind. By reason of its topicality at the time of writing, the particular behaviour selected for examination centred around the anti-apartheid movement. It was desired to ascertain whether moralism was especially high among anti-apartheid demonstrators. If this could be shown to be so, it would provide some encouragement to the view that moralism is one of the causes of anti-apartheid demonstrating.

This isn’t about what we want for the Kikuyus or the Luos or the Kalenjins or the Boranas or the Nandis or all the other tribes in Kenya. The other day, after the Hague results were announced, one of the IDPs on NTV said “At least, sasa, kuna Wakikuyu wawili na Wakalenjin wawili; wamebalance.” This isn’t what it is. We are not a tribe, we are people. This isn’t even about what we want for the men and for the women, or for the boy-child and the girl-child. It’s what we want for the men, women and children from Garissa to Namanga, Kisumu to Mombasa and everywhere in between.

Do you think the government as a corporation cares one ounce whether or not a mom-and-pop store closes its doors after 30 years in business? No. It either already owns the land and building that business is on, or is interested in buying it once the shops go out of business. Land ownership is the goal, not some meager monthly rent. Power comes with ownership.
and eventually lands in AMS. We are TIRED as all get out as we drag our bags from the Centraal Station to the Bulldog Hostel (a good 0.5 mile walk). We check in, drop off our bags, and I ask the lady at the table at the hostel where some good beer is. She looks at me and says in a dutch accent that "I don't know the beer, I just smoke weed." Both ladies at the front desk light up some blunts and I know that they are NOT going to be any help. Moving on...
I’ll probably email her right when we get back from Disney. I’ll have some cool stories to send her as well as some new pictures.

So I’m hoping the email will nearly write itself! In all actuality, I’ll probably write her an email before we leave, let it sit in my draft folder, and then delete and write a whole new one after we get back. I do a lot of that…

Men are often buried with their workmates, betraying how tightly bound a Bolivian's identity is to his profession. Here, they're not so much family men who happen to work as truck drivers; they're truck drivers who happen to have a family. In Sucre's cemetery, large common vaults owned by unions — coal miners, lawyers and teachers among them — occupy a lot of ground. Likewise, children aren't buried with their parents, but with other children under a large hill of white graves, which is both beautiful and sad. The kids' shrines are filled with Disney characters, coke bottles, toys and poems. Adults, too, have shrines filled with the things they loved — often tiny liquor bottles, or a pack of cigarettes.
If we wanted to solve a lot of things, we could alter our genetics to make us perform photosynthesis. We’d possibly turn green, but we wouldn’t need to eat (except maybe at night?). There would less of a need for violence against animals. (Hunting would still be necessary. Deer = 45,000 car accidents in one state in one year. You always fight for your team/species when lives are at stake. Mountain lions would still attack people if not put down. etc etc.)

In his usual contrary way, Spooky actually had a very good reaction to being declawed. He gave me the silent treatment at first, but he got a lot calmer and seemed to realize that he couldn’t do any damage anymore. He didn’t stop trying to rush at Scooter, but he gave up on serious physical damage and seemed resigned to having bark but no bite so to speak. They even seemed to work together on a project or two, such as the great Invisible Christmas Burglary episode of 2006.

The first of the four was the game’s first goal in Game 3 of the first-round series with the Bruins, a game the Caps eventually lost. Each of the next three power play goals has proven to be the game-winning goal, and not one of them has been a “cheap” game-winner. All three of those power play goals – from Alexander Semin, Troy Brouwerand Ovechkin – were tie-breaking tallies that turned out to also be the final goals scored in those games.

One of the major premises of the book is that what they call cognitive stratification is a product of a high-tech society. Before the 20th century, ". . . the number of very bright people was so much greater than the number of specialized jobs for which high intelligence was indispensable." (ibid.) But during that century, assert the authors, a class structure based on intelligence emerged.
For a couple of weeks, I felt mocked every time I opened my Google reader and saw all the wonderful things the homeschooling families were doing. I felt sickened when I walked by my bookshelf and saw the John Holt and John Taylor Gatto books. I considered unsubscribing from all the homeschooling blogs and putting the books in the basement. Thankfully, that dramatic response was short-lived. I don’t have to (and can’t, really) pretend that homeschooling doesn’t exist just because it’s not an option for us right now.
A chapter on how Chinese employs compound structures to combine a root with a nuance begins unexpectedly, with "danger" all around her in Shanghai leading to a consideration of how its derivation from "small heart" convinces Fallows of its relevance. Another chapter begins with "message" and unfolds into an exploration of the writing of characters, given that Chinese has 400 syllables vs. ten times that in English. A final chapter, the most poignant, shares her viewing of small and great acts of kindness after the great quake in 2008.
Was visiting the DDM climbing website and watched the following video, pretty scary stuff for those of you that were thinking of or perform this type of slinging.
The whole premise is that Amanda Clarke takes on a new identity (Emily Thorne) to exact revenge on all of the people who played a part in ruining her and her father’s lives. Amanda/Emily is such a complex character that she’s fascinating to watch. Most of the time, she’s so scheming that she appears to be nothing more than a sociopath. She’s completely cold and heartless.
His bedtime ritual had not changed. He had poured himself a nightcap around 10:00 p.m. local time, slipped into his silk pajamas and retired to his room to read for half an hour or so while he drank his brandy.
to stimulate your creative juices and generate fresh inspiration - Ten Tips to Inspire Creativity. I have a handful of REALLY COOL projects I'm working on that I'll be able to share in the coming weeks. We are taking today to "get our house in order" before the post Holiday, work week of real life turns us into our mere mortal selves at the stroke of midnight tonight! Happy New Year dear Blog friends, I appreciate your faithful reading.
The girl said, “My name is Sandra Baxter. I can get you guys in. I know every way and these blue prints are of no use without me because only I know how to read them.”
John chose this book because of the huge attention it has received since the English translation appeared in 2009. Originally published in Germany immediately after the war, with the encouragement of the new Soviet authorities, and based on a real-life case, it concerns an act of resistance by an ordinary working-class and middle-aged couple under the Nazi regime, the writing and dropping of anonymous postcards attacking Hitler and the war. The book is promoted by the English-language publishers, Penguin, as having been 'lost', although James Buchan informs us that it has in fact enjoyed a certain continuing life in Germany with television and film adaptations. It has however only now been translated into English.
We're a small class - about a dozen of us "adult beginners", all told. And we rank from White Belts (that would be me) all the way up to Brown Belts, who are more assistant teachers than students.
This was what Drew and I got her. I think it might take a while for her to really get the hang of pedaling. Right now she can do it if she's on a slight hill. Neil, Justin, and Darcy's "G.G." are the spectators in this picture.
Wrong! No diamonds just wellies, navy blue and very sensible. I still have them in the barn, rotted and unwearable but precious none the less. Those wellies saw me through a dear friends wedding ( love you Ludo -x-) And many Cornish boating expeditions. Route marches to beautiful English Inns with beloved faraway family.
But the appeal of this creek and the trail, beyond the already alluded to beauty, is the brokenness of the system. No, not the omnipresent litter, but the fact that hikers have to leave the creek to traverse along sidewalks, interrupting the reverie that comes with proximity to the rushing waters. This more than anything is a sign that we have yet to realize the value and potential of this creek for the former town and its current inhabitants.
Accomodationism, insofar as it seeks to dampen criticism of moderate religion in order to foster political alliances, silences action against very real problems perpetuated by these supposedly friendly faiths.

He’s out there for work. And when he comes home in a month, it’ll be to load up our house and move us. Move us away from everyone and everything I love. Everyone and everything I’ve worked so hard to get over my personal shit to let in.

I take a breath. I am in power here I am the interviewer. I think.
George Nicholas III threw a hissy fit and resigned from CAL again and less than a day later Devant Maharaj, who claimed he was caught by surprise over the resignation had installed Min of Finance Winston Dookeran’s cousin, Rabindra Moonan. Maharaj was open and upfront with us. he admits that Moonan knows nothing about aviation, but what he forgot to reveal as well is that Moonan’s business acumen (the purported strength on which he got the job) aint so hot up either. Check the company records. Ask them how the US feel about them…ask questions.
I had him through x-rays last year, looking for a bone fragment, but there is none. His jaw has healed as it should. So we are dealing with a fistula. Awesome… over the last six months it has been going down, the swelling has been none existent, although a tiny hole has remained, leaking a small amount of pus and since it has not seemed to bother him, my vet and I kept our fingers crossed, hoping that it would drain out now and heal up for good.
The History of Whoo counter was right next to Ohui and while waiting for the SA to process my details for the duty free price, I decided to splurge and get the Whitening Sun BB even though it was so expensive I’d originally put it on my back-up shopping list.

9. Buick Mckane- I’m actually convinced that this is THE best rock’n'roll song to have been made. It’s an epic song, no exaggeration, it’s got a generally HUGE sound and a ridiculously catchy riff which is mixed with Bolan singing along.
She didn't get into Sophie until about three months, but once she did, it was a pure love/love relationship. Even at three months, she could easily grasp it and maneuver it into her mouth to suck and chew on. Plus, it's adorable. On the downside, it is pricey (but you can get it from Amazon way cheaper than Babies R Us or anywhere else!). I would definitely buy it again.

I couldn’t sleep very well last night because I was supposed to be moving today. I woke up around 7am and cried for about a half an hour. Around 9am I knew he was awake so I came out to talk to him, he was on the couch. I sat down beside him and said I’ll make your mailbox key today, I don’t want to do this, I love you so much (I started crying), You hurt me so bad, I can’t completely remember the conversation but basically what came out of it was….He was mad at me for getting an attitude when he pushed me out of bed Monday night…that’s what this was all over…(except he contacted Betsy on Monday before that even happened). I told him I wanted to still be friends, I just needed some space, but he told me he would have to wipe his slate clean if I left. I said I had to…
I combat my vague fear of pissing any surrounding people off with incessant tappa-tappa-tappa by playing controlled pianississimo paradiddles and double-stroke rolls, shifting sticking around (RLRR LRLL, RLLR LRRL, RRLR LLRL and RR LL RR LL, LR RL LR RL, respectively). I try to concentrate on how good playing makes me feel, to let it envelope me like an electric blanket (or a cool breeze, if it's a hot day). I realize that every worry drips away from me when muscle memory takes over and I can rest comfortably in the space between the beats of the simplest rhythm. I can't help but imagine a warm golden sunlight emanating from me, splashing invisible contentment on the walls of wherever I happen to be. And no matter how dark and dank my surroundings or my mood, I have a feeling the contentment remains when I leave, maybe for someone else to enjoy.

The Hokies should win this game with the play of David Wilson and Logan Thomas in recent weeks. Sure UVA’ s defense has been pretty good and they have a lot of momentum building to the game but they have yet to see a QB of Thomas’ size, speed and athleticism. Tech will have to play perfect and score early silencing the Wahoowaa in Charlottesville and crushing any hopes that they have of an upset.

And neither did Mirka when I mentioned it, so off we went. And man was it fun. We were about 20 girls from age 18 all the way to 40, drinking alcohol and discussing both sherlock related things(such as which post-reichenbach theories we believe in and John’s jumpers) and other fandoms. So weird, but so much fun. And so going again.
And I will try, but with this topic its rather hard to be polite and “kosher” about everything. So just understand that I am not trying to be crass. And enjoy a laugh here and there. We certainly have!
You see, when I was a kid in Saginaw, Michigan, I made a horrible mistake: I chose to play the flute in my school band. I was the only boy to do so. And at first, I was just awful. There were twelve chairs, and for the first half of the first year, I was dead last. The girl flutists ignored me. The all-male drum section made it their habit to inflict on me the full range of junior-high-school torments, from tripping me up in gym class to writing “faggot” on my locker in magic marker to straight-up beat-downs. But I persisted in blowing the flute, that silvery phallus.

Anyhow, all this to say, its not our fault if our children turn out to be addicts, I think there is a culture of helicopter parents and think new parents should stop reading books and reading blogs about the "right way" to parent and just follow their instincts. LOL, that reminds me of an incident that makes me crack up when I try to visualize what it looked like:

Farmers' Market Tamales - these tamales were really easy to put together as instead of filling the tamales, the vegetables are mixed in with the corn dough, it really cut down on the time it took to make 24 of them. Instead of using the masa dough recipe in the book I used the olive oil-based dough from Terry's blog.
On such a day, one of the kids will fly in the back door, fresh home from school, and declare “Hey, Mom! Tonight would be a good night for the Snowflake Party!” First we round up every pair of scissors in the house. This is one time when sharing is not a virtue. While the kids search for scissors, I cut white paper into squares and fold them caddy-corner multiple times. The resulting triangles are artfully arranged in a basket, awaiting the beginning of the party.
Sleepy, sleepy head – waking slowly on this cloudy, Sunday morning. The house is quiet and as I sit alone on my porch, drinking my coffee and contemplating my day – I realize that despite the absence of another person here sipping coffee beside me I have made about ten “connections” to other folks in the last 3o minutes or so – through the wonders of the internet. Between, the blog (in progress), the Facebook account, my email and now Twitter, (@LisaBorchetta) – I am far from being alone at all. Don’t get me wrong here – I am not suggesting that I was feeling lonely, in fact I enjoy these quiet moments to myself, I am commenting on this new medium for connection that has become a regular part of my life these days. It’s interesting, and strange and powerful.
The straight hair we managed easily - there isn't hair any straighter than The Impossible Princess's. High ponytails are a little trickier - they sound easy enough, but you try doing one. It had to be high enough that you could see it when looking straight-on into the mirror.

Let us also immediately rule out the Church and its leaders from this atrocity. Much as I detest the hypocrisy and the fake prosperity gospel bling bling of the Bishop Wanjirus and Pastor Lais, I seriously do NOT THINK that they could have organized to kill of those thousands of Kenyan worshippers who gather every Sunday to make sure that these men and women of the cloth continue living large and lavishly while their flock toil to raise those tithes and sadaka. That would be like using a sharp panga to scoop out their own intestines.
The movie Death Proof should have been. Everything a Grindhouse movie should be. Everything a Nicolas Cage movie should be (sans dressing like a bear and punching women in the face). Everything 3D cinema should be. Drive Angry is the most fun you'll have with a movie this side of a Piranha.

I am not saying an integrated or holistic approach to their patient’s health would have kept him alive. Indeed, Jobs’s New Age ideas on eating and health (what Andy Grove of Intel called ‘trying to cure himself by eating horseshit and horseshit roots’ – p. 454) may have killed him; he refused surgery in October 2003, when even a leading alternative health practitioner advised him in favour of it. (I am not criticizing or diminishing Jobs; I sympathize with his fears.)
Just a quick little post about a new project I made! I found this little tart pan the other day and had it in my stash for a project. Randomly the other day I found a copper base. You can see it a bit better in the photo below.
Feed the birds hi-energy foods like black oil sunflower seeds, tree nut pieces and suet, which give birds more energy per ounce consumed. One need of wild birds often overlooked by consumers in cold weather is the need for ‘open water.’ The main reason they need water is to help keep warm. Birds fluff out their feathers so they can better capture a ‘layer of air’ that acts as heated insulation. Matted, dirty feathers can’t be fluffed out. Therefore, by offering food and water, dozens of your feathered friends will soon add brilliant flashes of red and blue, gray and white, across the snow, and you’ll hear their melodious songs as the sing “Thanks” to you for helping them survive.
About Sleeping Beauty: Dr. Burns’ first book on postmortem photography, Sleeping Beauty: Memorial Photography in America (1990) has been widely recognized as one of the most important photography books of all time. Sleeping Beauty has influenced an eclectic array of fields, from bereavement counseling religion and spirituality (not to mention pop music) and has been cited in debates on the death penalty, euthanasia and abortion. It has been the subject of numerous scholarly papers as well as seminars and exhibitions at notable institutions such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and The New Museum of Contemporary Art.

With such continuous success, Infinite is proving themselves to be the newly rising K-Pop star in Japan.
Take for example the poster that currently adorns the press kiosk on just near my house on the Place de la Republique. Ostensibly advertising a beauty magazine, it features a full frontal nude photo of a young lady -- only the words "Special Minceur" protecting what tiny shred of dignity she has left.

To be honest, I'm sort of up in the air with this addition to the product. I'm not a fan of manufactured patches, but the Demarcus Cousins RC Patch below does look pretty decent. The problem is, with the seemingly endless amount of products coming out year after years, I'm not going to spend money on something that looks decent. There are just too many products out there, especially with stickers. The lines are definitely blurred between product.
After our forced completion of the treadmill workout after only 30 minutes, the wife and I decided to walk on the track that our friend told us existed in the new (and completely different) part of the gym. We surveyed the possible routes to get to the area, and ultimately decided (as we were guided by the signage) to descend the steps to the first floor and make our way to track area located on, yet again, the 2nd floor of another adjoining structure to where we had just been.

The point is that I have been wanting to get back into writing, and I have been thinking about keeping a journal of a character’s life in Skyrim. I think I may kill two birds with one stone and write a fanfic about someone in the Skyrim world. This, of course, means trying to come up with all sorts of ideas about how to set it up. I’ll post it here for now, and maybe try to remember my fanfic login.. or the website… where my other fiction is mothballed. I am thinking maybe someone from the current world is transported into that world somehow… cliche, I know, but this is the first time I’ve written in a decade! Give me a break! I don’t want to use “myself” per se, though all my main characters are a bit of a reflection of myself. Feel free to add your input in the comments and let me know what is and isn’t working.
I had previously decided to leave this area as I live within the zone of the four previous New Madrid earthquakes. You need not disrupt your lives though I would not own a home in the area. But then owning a home anywhere in America is a losing proposition. My personal feeling is that the New Madrid fault will become active before the expected California quakes.
Back to Franklin Pierce. I thought about him and how ironic it was that there was another president named Franklin, and then I started thinking about all the different first names presidents of the United States have had, and the next thing I knew, I was off to Wikipedia, making a list.

Christmas morning was just myself, my husband and my son. It's the first year that our whole "family" wasn't here for Christmas morning so we did things a bit different. With my daughter and her boyfriend coming up mid day from his family's celebration, we decided to hold off and have our stockings, yep we still "do" stockings" just before bed so that we could all still share in that tradition.

Mark your calendars for SUNDAY, MAY 6th... I don't want you to miss it!!
I know, I know, my blogging has suffered lately. However, with all the baby stuff going on, including our baby shower and getting the nursery ready, I have just lacked time to edit photos and post. I am sure anyone who has expected a baby completely understands. Right now, I am 33 weeks and on cruise control until I hit full term and start seeing my doctor every week. My mother delivered both my older brother and I 10 days early so, I am prepping for doing the same...even if I don't, better safe than sorry. So I have been spending an exorbitant amount of time washing bedding, clothing and diapers, figuring out how in God's name things work (like folding up my stroller to fit in my car, holy geez) and most time-consuming, training someone to do my job for my maternity leave at work. Which, I must say, has proven more difficult than I originally thought. Regardless, I wanted to share a few pictures of the nursery!

Pictures have a way of expressing things that words simply cannot. So hats off to the photojournalists who provide a different kind of news, the kind of news that elicits a response, not just an opinion. So maybe a picture is not worth 1,000 words.

You have to love Tennant. His enthusiasm, his great outfit (love seeing the Doctor in trainers wether in a suit or tux). The most emotional of all the Doctors. Tennant was able to smoothly transition in a scene from loveable clever goofball to menacing ancient power.

Does that surprise you? Perhaps not. But the name of that school had as it’s suffix “school of science”. Science was its specialism and yet know one who attended it was a scientist? Why? My theory is that none of the pupils considered themselves ‘a scientist’ or ‘an artist’ or anything else because those are labels applied only to worthy adults. They hadn’t noticed that if you do science, you’re a scientist. If you do art, you’re an artist. Their version of the situation was that they are pupils. Boring, unimportant, useless and irrelevant pupils. Their job, their identity was to be a pupil. You might well say, what’s wrong with that? I feel it’s so limited and constraining that it’s dangerous.

I'm sure there are many local guys or former Cubs that have done it multiple times and would love to have some kind of comprehensive list.

My officemate went to a day-long discussion of this sponsored by Dartmouth Medical School. Apparently they had good arguers on both sides. There was an interesting moment when she leaped to the conclusion that one of the opponents, a woman who holds a dozen patents, probably has patents for competing pharmaceuticals and that's why she's opposed - a POV for which she has no evidence but illustrates how we like narratives to explain things to ourselves.

Before I get too, mushy, I'll share with you the card I made for her. Here's my philosophy on card making. I like cards to be quick, easy, and not make people guilty for throwing them away. :) I don't want to be the reason for someone's hoarding, someone's overflowing box of cards they can't bear to throw away because someone went to a lot of work making them. lol So here it is, simple, easy, yet cute.

In past articles, I have told my readers about the quality trading seminars I have attended through the years and how beneficial they are to anyone seeking knowledge and wisdom on the road to becoming a successful trader. The other night I was browsing through the workbook from a Technical Analysis Group (TAG) conference I attended in 1996. These TAG workbooks are packed with valuable information presented by all the speakers (usually 20 or more) at each conference. As I was thumbing through this particular workbook, there was a common theme espoused by the majority of presenters at the conference: In order to succeed at trading, it’s not only important to strive to learn more about markets and trading tools, but it’s also very important for a trader to know himself or herself. This is part of the all-important–but sometimes overlooked–aspect of “trading psychology.”

What passes for history in our schools today comes straight from the foetid imaginations of the agenda driven, white hating enemies of our people, who are dependant for their incomes on maintaining the good will of Common Purpose. It is not in their interest to make their pupils feel good about their country or about themselves, and they will certainly not tell any truths which reveal what it was that made Britain great .
Emmett went swimming for the first time this weekend! He wasn't a big fan when we first got in but once he got situated in his little floaty he was all smiles.
We went out to dinner last night to La Guadalupe, the mexican joint that has awesome food but very slow service. We split a ceviche, oh my god it was so good, and then I had a giant chile relleno while Serge had some kind of fajita thingie. Both were exquisitely delicious. Gotta love those family recipes. I ate every last bit off my plate and then realized I had crammed too much into my stomach and it took hours for that discomfort to subside. Hours! It's been ages since I've done that to myself. This morning I refused to step on the scale.

The girl was taller than the rest of the kids on the bus. She walked with intent and a steady pace, never looking left or right, just marching forward. He had to remind himself several times that he was following Ann, not just a girl off a school bus. He was surprised by the walk because he thought most kids departed right in front of their homes, but as random turns began to overlap, he realized that this was not a regular walk home. This was a walk not home.

Budget day is a month from today, Wednesday 21 March. And, in the run-up period, we have had all the predictable calls from the usual suspects – the BBPA, CAMRA, SIBA and the WSTA – for alcohol duties to be frozen and the duty escalator to be scrapped. The current policy, so they say, is closing pubs, losing jobs, encouraging smugglers and is anyway subject to the law of diminishing returns.

The only way to be saved; to go to heaven; to have eternal life is to do it God’s way. Today we are looking at Acts 27:31. The apostle Paul caught the sailors of that ill-stricken vessel seeking to flee the ship to save their own lives. “Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.”
Peregrine falcons are wild birds; they choose their own nesting sites. They chose to nest on the ledge of the Newton building and were first discovered when the University was investigating building work. Later, when the university carried out the refurbishment, they provided the nestbox to allow the peregrines to continue to breed undisturbed – and to ensure the university and their contractors did not break the law.

For me that’s how the barrier of “I’m just not enough” = “I’m not lovable” got put in place. And it truly was a barrier not just for me, but for those around me. I can’t tell you how many times my husband had told me he felt no matter what he did it was never enough. Well, let’s see, how could it be enough when I was not able to receive the love he was offering to me because I believed at my core I was not lovable. Without even knowing it, what I believed about myself was sending him the message thank you sweetie, I know I asked for your love but I’ve gotta bounce it back your way because I don’t deserve it. Talk about confusing signals for the poor man. On the one hand I’m telling him love me, love me, love me, and at the same time I can’t receive his love because I believe I’m unlovable, not enough. I literally apologized to him after this revelation for how my woundedness had hurt him over the years.

I really wish I felt love and acceptance from my family. The only way to show a family member love is to accept them, care about them, treat them with dignity and respect and welcome them into the family fold, no matter who they choose to love. I am the same old Lori I always was. I still love my kids. I am still more moral than most christians I know, I am a good mom, a loving person and sometimes a bit too tolerant of family members. I have not changed who I am. I have only chosen to BE who I am without shame or guilt. I am asking for love and acceptance. Nothing more.
I simply cut out the butterflies with my Once Upon A Princess cartridge, first moving the blade about 1/3 of the way down the paper. I then hit "line Return" and cut out one more. I trimmed the paper using the negative space where the butterfly was cut. I glued the trimmed papers on my cardstock, and one of each butterfly flat, then the second cut of each butterfly I glued down only the body and bent the wings up. I added some buttons, rhinestones and my sentiment and my card was finished.

US corporate profits remain healthy. However, nearly all of the growth in profits since the beginning of the economic recovery has been due to margin expansion. US corporate revenue growth continues to be lackluster. Management teams continue to emphasize improving operational efficiencies via cost cuts. They have little desire to hire new workers. Instead, the focus has been on productivity gains. These trends fit into the slow growth recovery theme that has shaped our investment policy.
So given the life changes I made, you would think that surrendering and listening to the angels would be a piece of cake, right? Oh nooooo, I’ve been fighting them for weeks. It got to the point where I simply got sick…really sick…to the point where I was too tired to fight. Last night, I waved the white flag and surrendered. I’m an Angelic IET practitioner/teacher. IET is a healing modality that uses angelic healing energy to “get the issues out of your tissues.” It’s my energy work of choice when I or a client has particularly stubborn energetic blocks. When you’re on the table receiving the healing it sometimes feels like nothing is going on. At other times it feels like someone is bulldozing your insides and clearing you out. In either case, you get what you need and the results show up quickly.

On Christmas Eve I went to Nobu’s for an omakase dinner with my dad and step mom when I was home in Hawaii. I was excited to go since Nobu’s was actually one of the first “fancy” restaurants that I went to with my dad when we had traveled to New York together when I was in High School. I remember being severed paper thin slices of raw beef that we then cooked at the table on a smooth stone that had been sitting in an oven for hours.

Okay, so there I was in the parking lot with my purse, ready to find that mother effing cell phone. I just have to find that thing, even though I will be done with my errand and back home in 15 minutes. Well, I found a phone all right AND the reason my purse was so heavy. I pulled out my lame cordless land line phone. Do people still even use land lines anymore? Apparently this chick does. Then because she is a dork, she tucks it into her purse due to what I am going to call... cell phone/land line confusion. So, this just pleads the case that I have been trying to make to my husband all along. We should cancel the land line and just use our cells. I mean really? Who uses those land lines anyway besides telemarketers? The fact that I don't want to be pulling out my cordless phone while I'm checking out at Safeway has absolutely NOTHING to do with it!!!
this past week has truly been one of the worst weeks ever. i am choosing to not get into it here for many reasons but believe me when i say it was full of bad news and drama and i hope to never go through what we went through ever again.

Having dedicated her book to “those who hear, those who see”, Shafak hands over to Esma Toprak, a London-bred Turkish Kurd, as she prepares to set off for Shrewsbury Prison to collect her brother, who has just served a 14-year term for murder. It is implied, but not confirmed, that his victim was their mother. Esma admits to having thought often about killing her brother in revenge. And yet she plans to welcome him back into the house she now shares with her husband and two daughters.

9. A drumkit is falling down the stairs. Seagulls through a guitar amplifier. Piano enters. Is this Zeuhl? No idea. I give up. It's very beautiful though and deserves more listens. Turns out it was "Friends of Dean Martinez", the same titled track off of "A Place in the Sun". I listen to "Random Harvest" and "In The Shadow of Your Smile" and love them, so this is an easy error on my part to rectify.
“From Harvest to Envair and even Wijaya, these deals seen together can give a wrong impression. Even if they are sheer coincidence, it can look suspicious. To some seasoned investors, it is the classic crowd trying to rush for a narrow exit all at the same time and this is why they catch the market’s attention,” the research analyst said.

Do not tell me what is wrong with your book: I can’t believe how many people will list all the publishers who have already rejected their books. If your book wasn’t good enough for them, why would it be good enough for me? You want to present your book in the best light possible so don’t mention the rejections. Similarly, don’t in any way belittle yourself or your book such as “I know the opening chapter is not that interesting, so I hope you will help me to make it more intriguing.”

Much has been written about man-eaters in the highlands of West Papua, while the image of blood-soaked savages prolongs orientalist prejudice, there are no credible witnesses to cannibalism. The missionary Tom Bozeman, working in this valley in the 1960s, graphically described the butchering and broiling of a man from a neighbouring village, killed in battle. “Some of the men had begun to build a fire near the body,” he wrote. “The man with the bamboo knife began to cut the meat from the dead man’s calves. I became nauseated.”
Left unfettered, the inequitable conduct doctrine has plagued not only the courts but also the entire patent system. Because allegations of inequitable conduct are routinely brought on “the slenderest grounds,” . . . patent prosecutors constantly confront the specter of inequitable conduct charges. With inequitable conduct casting the shadow of a hangman’s noose, it is unsurprising that patent prosecutors regularly bury PTO examiners with a deluge of prior art references, most of which have marginal value.

And I've read a number of articles (and been sent a number of articles by email) about how Haiti really is a basketcase, and what it needs is tough love. It needs to smarten up and take care of its own problems, because it's never going to get better when other people keep rescuing them. I've read the same thing about Africa: we should stop helping, because by helping, we're making it worse. We're enabling Africans to stop caring for the orphaned children, because they know we'll step in. So we're absolving them of all responsibility, and we're perpetuating the cycle. And not just that: we're allowing a society to continue that in all likelihood will become a threat to the Western world in a number of decades.
I had been under the impression that my patron (who pays for my lessons with my instructor) was going to pay for me to do my first Pro-Am competition in April or May, so I had plenty of motivation to get moving on the design. By February, I had a pretty good idea of what I intended for the cut of my gown, the shape and attachment of the floats, and a range of colors that I would consider. I drew pencil sketches of the front and back views. Then, armed with a folder containing my sketches and research, I took a Friday off work and did a day trip to New York and spent the whole day - from when the fabric stores opened until they closed - collecting swatches, devoloping and comparing various color and fabric schemes, and eventually making a lot of purchases.

I've added a short screencast of the steps taken to make an image like this at the bottom, I only did things quickly, it's probably best to take a little more time than I did for the video, after all you are going to want it to look nice, the video has captions to help you along the way, but before I go, I'm sure you've seen the types of pictures people have been taking with smart phone apps like instagram and others, you can do that in gimp as well, and the best of it there are plugins for gimp that will do it for you in much the same way as the smart phone apps do, have a look at the picture of my daughter below.

Other me walked ‘round my ship. “A-2” he read off the prow. “Cute.” I eye-balled him real good, then. Could he be a clone? Nah – couldn’t be; he wouldn’t be the same age as me. Even with all the research the CA Science Division had devoted to it, rapid growth hadn’t quite worked out as hoped. They would have had to clone me at birth, and even then, my clone would probably be in a wheel-chair by now, what with the rapid cell degradation. CA had thought cloning at birth could get around that, and no one had figured out why it hadn’t. I thought I might know, but I wasn’t talking. Nope, I wasn’t doing nothing to direct CA’s gaze my way.
