The weather is almost always sunny and warm (temperatures in the 70s and 80s), the ballparks are cozier than regular stadiums, beer and hot dogs are cheap(er) and everything — parking, tailgating, finding your seats, standing in line for food — is just more laid-back. Many of the seats are so close that fans can hear the on-field chatter. Players haven’t become mired in slumps or losing streaks yet, so most of them don’t mind stopping for autographs.

The cap on wages subject to Social Security taxes limits the amount of monthly benefits that those with high incomes can collect when they retire. And the deduction for mortgage interest is designed to help families acquire large assets and promote more stable neighborhoods.

He and the other first responders of the fictitious firehouse remain stranded, psychologically, almost right where they started 10 years ago, at ground zero. For them, the only salvageable emotions from Sept. 11's wreckage are like twisted metal shards, hard and dangerous to touch.

I just want to go a little bit farther with the "Senior shame" in today's paper. I'm a senior, 72 years old, been paying Social Security since I was 15 and was working. I also saved a lot of my money and put it in investments, and I'm fortunate that I can afford to pay the $1,200 a month that I have to pay for medication because of the doughnut hole in the program that we have. And someone that says shame on the seniors for taking so much money and not getting any increase, it does bother me that they are definitely not in the shoes of the people who had to work for nothing and had very little income coming in and could not save because they were taking care of their families. These are the people that are really getting hurt today, and tomorrow, because of the Social Security not giving them any raise last year or next year, and this year, so it's a shame that we in the United States of America that we cannot take care of our seniors who have worked so hard to build this country ...

Strassel: This is a miss for President Obama's campaign team, which this week on a website publicly named and shamed eight private citizens for the crime of donating to Mitt Romney's campaign.

"His energy, his enthusiasm is amazing," Blazers assistant coach Bill Bayno said. "And his willingness to work and spend time with (players) is invaluable. Once you develop that bond with them, I think, you really connect and have an influence and really keep them focused and get them to buy into what Nate wants taught.

The big reveal, part II: Danielle gathers her daughters Christine and Jillian together on the pretense of showing them some pictures.

Danielle calls it "damage control." We don't actually see her telling her kids what she tells her cameras -- that she stripped, that she was arrested, that she changed her name -- and there wouldn't be much point, because it's pretty obvious from her kids' blase reactions that she's already prepped them in private. And rightfully so.

Refined sugar -- not the kind found naturally in fruit -- is bad for us because it quickly spikes our blood-sugar levels. If we overload our bodies with it, we store the excess as fat.

The recommended daily consumption is nine teaspoons for men, six for women and three teaspoons for children.

That's become the question to ask this week, as you look around a conference that has long been known around the country as thin. It's been USC and everyone else in prior years. And last season, Oregon and Stanford, then a puddle of questions. And while I've always been quick to defend the conference to outsiders (I covered a ridiculously overrated Big Ten Conference as a beat reporter in the late 1990s), it's true that what the conference most needs over the next two seasons is to be at its best with so many new eyeballs on it.

HOW IT WORKS: The U-shaped, bendable light is extremely adaptable. For example, a camper, hiker or backpacker can hang the light from the neck, with the LED "arms" bent up for better illumination. It also can be bent around objects or hung from the top of a tent. Two AAA batteries power it for as long as 40 hours (the manufacturer says). Each flashlight head has a spotlight bulb and a wide-angle bulb. They can light separately or simultaneously. Easily accessed buttons atop the lights turn them on and also cycle through the brightness options.

Cedric Parker, 23, of Cleveland: Sentenced Monday by Judge John Sutula to 24 years in prison for felonious assault on a police officer using a gun, aggravated robbery and kidnapping. Parker and a 16-year-old boy, both wearing masks June 26, robbed the Family Dollar store at 3407 Payne Ave. Parker pointed a gun at the 47-year-old store manager and demanded money from the safe, Assistant Prosecutor Brian Radigan said.

The teen, now 17, was arrested and sentenced in juvenile court to detention until his 21st birthday with the possibility of six years in adult prison.

"I love listening to vocalists, listening to how they phrase melodies, how they interpret certain phrases," Farinacci said.
The Tea Fire was raging across the hills of Montecito, and T.C. Boyle was worried. He was worried about the safety of his home, as anyone near the flames would be, and that concern was amplified by the fact that the nearly century-old house was designed by no less than Frank Lloyd Wright. And then there were the papers: the highly combustible manuscripts, research, notes and bound volumes that constitute Boyle's life's work. Everything that had gone into writing two dozen books and 150 stories was stashed in Boyle's basement. If the wind shifted, it would all be lost.

I want to add that to the previous thing of what the mayor can do to help the arts economy is that we can go down to Salem and lobby for support not only for the Cultural Trust but also the film and video tax credit. I've been pretty judicious about tax credits. But that's one that's demonstrated significant leverage.

"It was a bad play, there is no way around it," said Oklahoma City coach Scott Brooks, who coached Artest as an assistant during the 2006-07 season in Sacramento. "It was a dangerous play. It's not a play that should be involved in basketball. I know Ron. Unfortunately, it did happen, but you can't do that. It's unacceptable."
The effect is startling but also somewhat harsh and unsparing. It's uncomfortably close to a kind of detached, tough love rather than an expression of affection.

Joe Freeman: There is no doubt that Jamal Crawford will opt out of his contract, and once he becomes a free agent, the Blazers will not pursue him. Crawford arrived in Rip City with much fanfare, promising to provide excitement, scoring and clutch play -- all while softening the blow of Brandon Roy's sudden retirement. But Crawford and the Blazers were a bad match from the beginning. He started slow, struggling to find his way with new teammates, and never meshed with coach Nate McMillan's plan to play him at both point and shooting guard. Crawford had some big scoring nights, but was mostly inconsistent during his lone season in Portland and even he would acknowledge he had a disappointing season. Crawford will be a sought-after free agent, but the Blazers will not be among his suitors.

You might want to blame our divisive political rhetoric on anxiety and uncertain times, but it wouldn't be fair. Studies have shown that anxiety and anger have two very distinct effects on political behavior. Anxiety is a response to a perceived threat over which a person feels little control. In contrast, anger arises as a response to a negative event that a person feels gets in the way of his goals. Anxiety leads people to overestimate risk and do nothing; anger tends to lower one's sense of perceived threat and leads to heightened risk-taking.

Stay curious and interested, but unless she becomes depressed, out-of-sorts, reluctant to go to school, or her grades fall, trust that she is handling things just right.
