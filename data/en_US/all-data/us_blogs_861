Our fixation on beating an index, seeking alpha, leads to a culture of market timing where we attempt, often very poorly, to time when to buy and when to sell. This invariably leads to buying high and selling low and toward financial disappointment.
Oh, and one more thing, Di Lazzaro's performance reminded me of my acting debut when I played a guard in a grade five production of... (holy crap, I can't remember the name of the play). Anyway, I recall being so excited over the fact that they were gonna let me make my own costume, that I totally forgot that I was going have to stand in front the entire school. Sure, all I had to do was stand there while holding a spear (an old ski pole spray painted silver). Plus, I was going to be wearing a mask for the duration of my scene (a cardboard box covered in tinfoil). But still, I was terrified. Now imagine having Udo Kier lying on top you, finger-banging the bejesus out of your gallbladder, while Paul Morrissey and a bunch of Italians (the film was shot just outside of Rome) stand off to side watching. It makes my guard duty sound like a walk through a butterfly-infested estuary.
This year for spring break we took a quick little family trip to Dallas.
Based on the examination and the vet’s recommendations, along with evidence procured during the investigation, a search warrant was issued for the seizure of the horse. It has been transported to a rehabilitation facility in Clinton to be cared for by trained staff.

As we stand awestruck, the sun drips into the ocean, staining sky and sea alike with colours so vivid and outrageous, no artist could recreate them and be believed. It's one of those Caribbean sunsets that is so over the top, it's almost too much to handle.
To prove a foreign national has the requisite “exceptional ability,” the employer must file documentary evidence showing: 1) the foreign national’s work during the past year did, and the foreign national’s work will, require exceptional ability; and 2) must submit documentation to show this exceptional ability. The DOL provides a list of suggested documentation, as follows, but does not specify how many of the categories must be addressed. The more evidence submitted, however, the greater the chance of success. The evidence requested by DOL includes:
So, bearing in mind what has happened recently, I hadn't really been out socialising or partying in any way, but when an invitation to see a new comedy play in the West End popped into my inbox, I couldn't have been more pleased, or thought of a better way to throw myself back into London life.

So far, I’m liking this dynamic between Tan Ya and Young Ho. He’s the opposite of Gwan Woo in almost every way. Age, money, experience. I’ll be honest, though. While I like the Wonder Woman therapy sessions, I’m Team Gwan Woo. Unlike Young Ho who suppresses his true feelings, Gwan Woo is like bleeding heart and that’s the kind of man (or boytoy) Tan Ya needs in her life. I also like that Gwan Woo is the first person that turned her and her butterfly branding down. He could flee at any moment but that’s what love is. It’s a risk and you can’t love someone by physically tying them down.

So why is it, that I am caught in a situation where I have to push the kids hard in their school work during weekends, school holidays etc when the school is pushing so hard. Their weekdays is already filled with work from morning till night with just enough time to eat in between and I have to do this during weekends and school holidays too? I want the kids to be able to have time to draw and read and write silly stories. They want to do this NOW but they never have the time.
So I really have to get something off my chest. I love bread! I am part Italian so I blame my obsession with pasta and bread on the fact that I am Italian. But I think I’m just kidding myself. I didn’t grow up in Italy and I wasn’t bombarded with Italian food. I just love me some carbs I guess. Bear in mind, carbs are not a bad thing. I think one of my biggest pet peeves is when a person says they are going on a low carb or no carb diet. I want to just punch them in the face. Well, ok maybe not really. I guess the more appropriate response would be to sit them down and explain that fruits, veggies, and grains are all carbs. Your body needs them because it gets it’s sole form of energy (glucose) from these foods. Cutting them out is just plain bad. And why would you want to deprive yourself of anything? A healthy diet is one that contains all the foods groups. Not just some of them. I really wish chocolate was a food group.

Nothing like a personal assistant to make you look like a fool at work. Siri hadn't done herself any favours by botching up this simple task, but all was not lost. I explained to my bemused colleagues that it probably had something to do with my accent and she probably needed some further training in that area. I then asked her to ring one of the other girls just to prove she wasn't a complete loss.

Fuels today create or are oxygenated to maintain the light ends, or vapor, that improve its volatility. Ethanol does a good job of meeting this need but in this process however the more vaporizing ability of the fuel the more quickly a given volume can become unstable. Stabilizers are formulated to maintain the mix of petroleum gasoline, the ethanol and the oil additive to the blend.

The officers also are accused of filing fake reports and double-dipping by charging the city for items such as uniform expenditures while pulling money from the drug forfeiture funds. The investigation started after a police official asked Michigan State Police to investigate the department’s use of drug forfeiture funds. The charges stemmed from the probe of what Worthy called “a culture of corruption and greed at its core.”
Because both Amanda and Susan have ties to I Heart Faces, I thought I'd use the site's logo for some design inspiration. I modified the corners from rounded to square and added a 'flash'.

Stepping outside after dark was the biggest treat of all; a veritable cornucopia of astrological delight enveloped me and captured my immediate and unwavering attention. Had it not been for the incessant attack of viscous sandflies I could have stayed there all night, every night, gazing up in awestruck wonder. As it was, it became a nightly ritual, after putting the littlest hobo to bed we would head out into the inky darkness and stand in front of the house looking up for a few minutes, the void of silence echoing on the mountains that surrounded us. I have never seen so many stars filling the sky - if I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes I would have struggled to believe it.
I made some progress with that. Then believe it or not, one day in the autumn of 2003 I worked out that the global economy was heading for a massive crash - which would inevitably rival the one of 1929 - and a depression similar to the one of the 1930s. So my Great Depression lyrics got a new focus. We might have been doped by consumerism in a Fight Club way right then ("working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need" as Tyler Durden had it), but a new Depression was coming, and it would be really fucking dreadful for almost everyone on the planet. But at the same time, it would provide an opportunity for the human race to break down those invisible walls of separation, and get together to tear it all apart...before rebuilding.
Plenty good, as it turned out. Eric and Patrick eventually laid off on me, though it took awhile. Not a solution I would've imagined, but then, it was exactly the sort of thing my father would've thought of. He was not a violent man. Quite the opposite, in fact. He was intellectual in a down-to-earth way, one might even say he was street smart. He knew enough to keep a level head when it came to dealing with bullies.

I think I've brought you up to speed. I'm now working on the sequel, which is tentatively called THE PLAGUE OF DARK INFINITY. Shadow Mountain had me map out the series as five books, so that's where it stands now. But each book will stand alone much more than my Jimmy Fincher series, which was really one big book sliced and diced into four. But, of course, there is a huge arc that goes over the whole series of THE 13TH REALITY.
This portfolio provides 10 instructional plans for 3rd graders based on the topic food chains. Primarily, it will focus on 3.5 of the SOL . Additionally, it will also make some connections with 3.4: animal adaptations and with 3.6: ecosystems. This project focuses on the types of relationships among living organisms and their dependence on each other for survival. The strand focuses on the life processes of plants and animals and the specific needs of each. The major topics developed in the strand include the basic needs and life processes of organisms, their physical characteristics, behavioral and physical adaptations, and survival and perpetuation of species.

After our late lunch we headed across the street to Top Shop and some other small (expensive!) boutiques. Neither of us were having much success shopping, but we did see A LOT of Harajuku teens with their crazy spiky hair and extravagant style (boys in heels, but not in a transsexual way, just in an extreme way, its hard to explain). A few were nice enough to let me snap some pictures. After wandering through the busy streets we found an off-street which had a ton of cute, funky and cheap boutiques. Somehow I managed to find the perfect dress for Passover at over 50% off (it was like 3,000 Yen/ 30USD) and it fit perfectly. Brittany found some dresses and shoes and we were on our way!

Dan Schaeffer tackles one of the most difficult topics facing the church today. Many people are leaving the church. Not their faith. But the church itself. Why? Because they are tired of going through the motions—removing the joy from worship.

“You haven’t been initiated yet, Danni,” the Elder replies, smiling. He draws a hand along the myriad of wounds covering Eliss, starting from largest to smallest, chanting in that strange language fingers glowing as they touch each cut or gash. They seal themselves as his hand passes. There isn’t a mark on the Elder after he has finished- no wound opens. No blood from eyes, mouth or nose. Mesdan feels a shock of shameful envy. The Elder, whose name is Kesta, turns to Mesdan when he’s through.
Make a batch of sweet tea, using the filtered water. A Brita filter system works fine. You want something that will remove the choline, or it will kill the SCOBY. When tea is room temperature, add SCOBY and Kombucha from previous batch. Cover with a tightly woven cloth (I used a t-shirt doubled over) and a rubberband. Fruit flies and gnats are attracted to kombucha I hear and you don't want them laying eggs in your SCOBY! I haven't had any problems, but it isn't exactly the season for them either.

Instead they played what they claimed to be a lot of very old songs, “songs so old even we forgot how to play them”. Man, the one time I know more newer material than older material, the band has to go play older material. Meanwhile, I go to see all these other shows looking to hear their earlier songs that I love, and they always play stuff from the newest album(s) instead! (Particularly guilty: Sisters Of Mercy, and, at times, Type O Negative, and most other bands too, those are just the ones that pop into my head at the moment.)
Think about it: if the gender roles had been ordained by God, and, indeed, encoded right into the nature of boys and girls (as any competent God really ought to have done), then surely it shouldn’t matter how a child is brought-up; if males are ordained by nature towards masculinity*, then what bloody difference would parenting (which is, of course, a social factor) make? May I conclude, selon the pastor, that if I dress my (hypothetical) son up as a pretty pink fairy princess and call him by some girly name that he will grow-up to be a transwoman?

I attended another recital at 4:30, this one for a fellow horn player, and I even stuck around afterwards and practiced on my horn for about an hour! I was proud of myself. From the music building, I contacted my friend Lexi. Recall that I first met Lexi on Twitter back in May or so of last year and officially met her last fall when I visited her church, which I now attend. Through me, Aaron started following Lexi on Twitter, and they got to the point where they tweeted each other quite a bit. So I arranged for the two of them to officially meet. Lexi and I went and ate at Chipotle while Aaron ate dinner with his family, and then Lexi and I picked Aaron up. The three of us went to Bahama Buck’s and talked for a while before driving back to the Tech campus and watching a movie in the room (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which neither of them had seen before). It was a nice little get-together, and Andrew even got to meet Lexi for the first time; he had been working at Relay for Life with his fraternity, but he made a quick visit to the room when he learned that Aaron was here. Such a good evening!

God was giving me my Promised Land as I yielded to Him.

It is not clear whether economic hard times will finally force us to break the mad cycle of poverty and punishment. With even the official level of poverty increasing -- to over 14% in 2010 -- some states are beginning to ease up on the criminalization of poverty, using alternative sentencing methods, shortening probation, and reducing the number of people locked up for technical violations like missing court appointments. But others, diabolically enough, are tightening the screws: not only increasing the number of 'crimes,' but charging prisoners for their room and board, guaranteeing they'll be released with potentially criminalizing levels of debt.

I too was let out of the demo, along with a handful of other EDL. We too were set upon by marauding Muslims. We too were sent in the direction of Muslims by WMP - to receive ‘a good kicking’ by a far greater number of Muslims. All this was deliberately done by WMP! Rather than protect the public, the EDL was that day's sacrificial lamb to the WMP’s political correctness and Islamophilia.

Before you back out of the driveway, make sure that everyone, or at least the deciders, is on the same page about key elements of the trip. For example, I have a pretty firm "No IHOP" rule. Mr. Incredible knows that barring some unforeseen disaster, our family breakfasts are not going to happen at IHOP while we're on the road. We have conversations about wake-up calls and how and where we're going to spend our time (Park Hopper tickets make this an essential discussion). Everybody in the group, even the non-deciders, has expectations about what will and will not be a part of the trip, and communication about this is so important.

Harold Pinter(1930) arrived in the 1950s with his “ Drama of Menace”. He had been associated with Samuel Beckett and The Theatre of the Absurd and his method resembles theirs. He did many studies of human disintegration. Before the plays he had written a novel The Dwarves which was later published and his 1963 play of the same name is derived from it. It follows Len through a mental breakdown and retreat into madness. Pinter has used this theme of the mind's retreat into its own kingdom as an escape from the unbearable demands of the world several times. There are “Beth” in Landscape(1967) and Kate in Old Times(1970). Women who insulate themselves from reality in a sort of dream scape.

After graduating college in May 2008, I pretty much took off working out for 2 years. I mean, I worked out at the gym a couple of days a week and rode my bike everywhere, but again, I really wasn’t passionate about getting back into the grind of things. That all changed on April 25th, 2010.

Anyhoots. (Ha! Get it?? Hoots?!?!? I crack myself up!) Nice Sales Lady tried to help me find an amazing black and white lace bra that was out of stock (bummer) and then helped me to a dressing room with my other choices. As I stood in the dressing room trying on bras, every girl's favorite weekend activity, I overheard another associate talking to Nice Sales Lady.
Grand-plie In Black is a pigmented black jelly with copper/orange small hex glitter. The photos are pretty poor because I was taking photos under a regular lamp at night time, but you get the idea. I only needed 2 coats and it had a really pleasing formula. I wish there was a wee bit more glitter in GPIB but it's still a really cool polish and I can see doing a manicure with an orange/copper accent nail/stamping design looking awesome. I don't think it was gritty and I only used 1 layer of top coat.
I had a lot of fun with this one! I decided to make a scalloped easel card! I don't think I have ever made a scalloped easel card before so I thought it would make a perfect shape for my Easter card! Anyway, I hope you like it!

In any medical test, there is a range of result values. There are occasionally going to be outlying values, and those values may or may not possibly be indicators of an issue. Whether something that represents only a "chance" of a condition is required to be conveyed to the patient at every opportunity isn't a decision that should be made in a courtroom to be honest.

The French are Coming! Building on the avant-garde experimental linguistically unusual other alternative hybrid work of poet-promoters like S.J. Fowler, and Tom Chivers, the pioneering Paris-based poet and inventor Jean-Jacques Lapierre (above) is bringing his Poesie Trois Menagerie series to London this May, in a deliberate attempt to provoke comparisons to the Futurist visits of almost a century ago. Lapierre senses a swing to the Euro-text, as he calls it, in London - already home to nearly a million French speakers - and wants to start a cross-chunnel 21st century poetic revolution.

1. The NET Bible: No suprise to anyone who regularly reads this blog. It’s something of a median translation, with lapses (some books read more formal than others, needs an overall stylist once over). It’s strength is in the 60,000 notes, which enable you to understand the why behind its and other bible transltions actual word choice. Alas, some of the notes are a bit biased, but I’ve yet to find a study bible that wasn’t biased in some way.
In 1936, she retired, further proof that she never had the mania for stardom to begin with. The following year divorced her husband/manager for her piano player Myrl Alderman – who soon found himself shot full of holes. You shouldn’t oughtta cross Moe the Gimp. This juicy story was made into a 1954 film, called Love Me or Leave Me starring Doris Day and James Cagney (for once, intelligent casting in a Hollywood bio-pic).

One of our favorite things from Sunshine School every year is our girls' ME books. Mrs. Amy did an awesome job creating a book of memories from this year too, and it was so fun to read through it and see how much Abby Kate has grown this year! The best quote from the book:
Greek workers actually work many more hours than do Germans, and earn less. The “secret” to Germany’s economic dominance within the European Union is cuts to German wages. Germany has undercut other countries that use the euro as their currency by suppressing wages, a process that took form under a Social Democratic government.
b. Our puppy/ies chewed up some wire on our air conditioning unit...bad dogs! My husband and I like to be cool when we sleep so finding out about this at 9:30pm after we get home from our busy weekend was not fun. Luckily, Chad was able to fix it - thank-you God for giving me such a handy husband! I'm not sure if this is a permanent fix or if we'll need new wires or what, but I'm praying that it will survive the torture our puppies gave it and keep on keeping on.
Waldemar ends his Christmas wish list by requesting that at least, there will be a time limit imposed upon video art of 2 minutes maximum. But I sit on the cold floor letting Dean's visual poetry wash over me like the cascades of the waterfall in the film. I could give all my time to its entrancing assault on my senses. For me Dean's films is one of those legendary Turbine commissions, like Ai Weiwei's sunflower seeds or Carsten Holler's slide, that I will always be able to say that I saw. It is a lyrical affirmation of the importance of video art in a year of dissent.

13. Give up the past. I know, I know. It’s hard. Especially when the past looks so much better than the present and the future looks so frightening, but you have to take into consideration the fact that the present moment is all you have and all you will ever have. The past you are now longing for – the past that you are now dreaming about – was ignored by you when it was present. Stop deluding yourself. Be present in everything you do and enjoy life. After all life is a journey not a destination. Have a clear vision for the future, prepare yourself, but always be present in the now.

Because it isn't about me! And the reality is that this is true for every single one of my children. Even the ones that I have parented since birth. Far too often I fall into this thinking that everything about my children's future depends upon my stellar parenting. Which is an awfully heavy weight to bear, considering how much I mess up as a parent. And all that comes from this kind of thinking anyway is 'control- mommy-mode', and nobody wants a piece of that. That's some freaky stuff, y'all.

All of this places Marriner Eccles as one of the greatest Gadianton robbers in the history of the world. It appears that he cut his deal with the devil by borrowing money from the Federal Reserve to save his beloved First Security Bank from bank runs in the early 1930s. He helped them consolidate their power in Utah by merging his bank with the Mormon Church owned, Deseret National Bank. The General Authorities of the Mormon Church, which ran the Deseret National Bank, thus surrendered their beloved bank, the first bank in Utah, to Eccles and the Federal Reserve System.

I hate the thought of my children having a mother that is chronically “sick.” I know, we all know, that it is NOT life-threatening but for day-to-day life, my illnesses have brought me nothing but pain, both physical and emotional. I was healthy and fine in all but the last three years but I am not sure if my children, now 15 and 17, remember that. They know what is happening now and they know what they remember from the recent past. It breaks my heart, literally, to have them be the one whose “mom is always sleeping” or “not feeling good.”

While all along, the thought and idea behind Blogging Marathon has always been to support all types of bloggers, be a month old or have couple of years over them, we have now reached a stage where it has become important that we take up bloggers who have the passion and dedication to justify the readers time. It becomes very important to make sure each blogger who signs up, show a certain level of maturity, dedication and in general being conscious of the reader's time. So towards that, it is decided that the group has some entry criteria in place. Each blog will scrutinized to make sure it fits the requirement before being accepted for the marathon.

The Criterion set also includes excerpts from his series of films Hapax Legomena and his epic unfinished Magellan Cycle. From the former series comes “(nostalgia),” which along with “Zorns Lemma” is one of Frampton’s best known films. It’s a simple set up. The film begins with a black screen as fellow avant-garde filmmaker Michael Snow reads Frampton’s narration about an unseen photograph. Snow proceeds to talk about a subsequent image, while the image he’d previously spoke of slowly burns to ash atop an oven’s radiating heat coils. This continues until Snow speaks of what is supposed to be a terrifying image – which we never see. Frampton’s drollest punch line, if you can call an image at the end of a 32-minute silent film a punch line, comes at the end of “Poetic justice,” in which a static camera is held on a coffee table while 240 pages from a film script appear one by one. It’s a lot funnier, and more surreal than it sounds.
Growing up, my parents never ate lobster, although it was a plentiful catch and could be had for pennies a pound. Their mothers would have been mortified if they’d been reduced to serving lobster to their families. It was not something you ate unless you were starving; then, if your neighbours wouldn’t feed you and you had to eat lobster, you buried the shells in the night so that those heartless neighbours would not know what you’d done.
The shift from pensions to not-quite pensions—or no pensions at all—is happening all across corporate Canada. Only 39 per cent of employees have a workplace pension plan, according to Statistics Canada. And that figure, dismal as it is, paints too rosy a picture. It includes DC pensions. It includes government workers, most of whom have a pension, and a DB one at that. In the private sector, only one in seven workers has a DB pension plan. One worker in nine is in a DC or other plan. The remaining 75 per cent of us? No pension coverage at all.
Under communism, Marxism preaches that private ownership of property will be abolished. Since oppression is only possible because of economic exploitation, the inability of anyone to acquire economic wealth will prevent the formation of an oppressor class. Thus, the historical cycle of class warfare will be broken and, in its place, a Utopian communist world will emerge, promising eternal love, peace and harmony.

The zone also feels really big. Every quest hub is more concentrated with quests, and for gathering or killing quests it never goes that far away from the quest-giver. So once you complete ten or fifteen quests in the town, and you get a breadcrumb quest to the next area, even if it’s just the next town over it feels like you did more than the other expansion starting zones. It also helps that Blizzard does not allow you to fly in Pandaria, which forces people to explore and properly appreciate the artwork.

Discovered Authors is the publishing wing of parent company BookForce and it comes with five different imprints, as well as the ambiguous sixth tag ‘Associated Publishers’, of which many links to books are broken or lead to just one other publisher called ‘Literally Publishing Ltd’ based in Oxfordshire, England. One previous imprint operated by Discovered Authors was Undiscovered Authors which functioned as a national competition aimed at seeking out new literary talent on any subject. The reason why Undiscovered Authors ceased was because it was funded by Dialog Group, an Austrian based company which went bankrupt in 2007, and also provided Discovered Authors with its accounting systems.
Okay, okay, the badger could have been a joke.

I got the whole dress made in the afternoon and I’ll share it with you when I wear it later in the month, as well as my more detailed thoughts on the pattern and everything. I’m certainly very pleased with the finished dress and I like the concept of being able to personalise it to such an extent. That said, I realised I have been totally spoiled by the fantastic directions in Colette Patterns and Sewaholic Patterns. More than a few times I was baffled over the wording of the instructions, only to find that what I was being directed to do was really simple! So I’d say that sewing this dress wasn’t as enjoyable an experience as some of my other makes. Still, though – it means I have already met the challenge I set myself to sew two more dresses in May, so I am super pleased with that. I have the fabric and notions for another Colette Hazel dress and I certainly will get down to that sometime soon, but for now I think it’s time to take the foot off the pedal (fnar) and enjoy the fruits of my labour.
I made a mask from one of my photocopies of the bird and attached it firmly with some weak double-sided tape. Using the chisel end of the B63 I added a faint blue around the bird, getting darker closer to the bird. Then, I added larger speckles with the brush end of the B63 and a G12 marker. By airbrushing very lightly from a brush end, you can get larger speckles than if you airbrush directly with the chisel. After I was content, I added a final touch of Opaque white to the eye and beak.

2) Moving on isn’t … moving on. I realized that everyone, everyone will pretend to know what they’re talking about when they give advice and will tell you to “move on”. So I started asking people… “How? How do you move on?” And guess what I discovered? No one knows the freaking answer. So a) when people tell you to move on ask them to take their advice and shove it … never mind. Just tell them to please be quiet. and b) I hate to be the one to break it to you, but you never move on. You move away and forward. Does it make a difference? Yeah, it makes all the difference in the world. See, moving on isn’t a clearly defined term. What does to move on mean? Does it mean things don’t hurt anymore? Does it mean you don’t care anymore? … What the heck does it mean?! No one’s ever clearly defined it. Hence, why I hate this term so much. Let me tell you something about pain and “moving on” from it. If something hurt once, it will always hurt a part of us. If something mattered once, it will always matter to a part of us. Always. You carry your pains and your experiences as part of you as you go through life. You carry them within you. Yet, you keep moving forward through life. So people shouldn’t tell you to move on with your pain, they should tell you to move forward with your life.

Florian: I spent 72 hours in a blind to shoot the snowy owls that are my book. (A blind is a cover or shelter that hides the photographer and his equipment.) It’s definitely a patience game because the sun wasn’t out or they weren’t turning their heads the right direction and that was really, really hard. Another thing that took a lot of patience was filming the big caribou herds, because it took 3 different expeditions to film them. On the first two trips I only saw one caribou and then on the third trip I finally saw the big herd and that was really rewarding. To be honest though I don’t get bored, because there is always something to discover, suddenly I see a bird’s nest or I hear the song of a bird and that intrigues me. And also I often have to make up the images in my mind first, so I spend time doing that. That gives that you that drive and energy to get the shot. You become more in tune and I love discovering things. The more you sit out in silence the more you learn and the more you discover.

Property, by the way that belongs to the RR right of way, but which they’ve been claiming and now know it is not theirs; which, to their way of thinking, makes it ideal to use as a drug haven.

The fact that gold can’t be created at the whim of government officials has tremendous implications. Under a representative from of government, the citizens are supposed to be in control of the politicians. Gold acts as a safeguard for this process. If only gold is money, the politicians have to tax the citizens directly for any and all government expenditures. Wars, welfare, corporate bailouts, bureaucracies, and everything else that the government wants to do must be financed through taxes or by borrowing gold from the citizenry.

In fact, since my presentation was so late in the conference, I thought we might be grateful for an extra audience member. I was right. It was great to spend time with my mom in this way.
I personally dont put cream in it, I like to keep some in the fridge for the week, also if I want it a bit thicker i add an extra parsnip or just use a really big one to start with.
Enjoy a guided tour of the famed Guinness Storehouse®, where you’ll be treated to lunch in a private dining room. During your stay in Dublin, you’ll also visit the Trinity College Library to view the ancient Book of Kells, a breathtakingly beautiful illuminated manuscript created by Celtic monks around the 9th century. Explore historic Blarney Castle where you’ll kiss the Blarney Stone. It is said that he or she who kisses the Blarney Stone will forever be granted the “gift of gab,” the ability to speak with a clever and flattering tongue.

After our visit, Leslie suggested my brother and I travel a mile or so up the road to have lunch at Banty’s restaurant. I ordered a large plate of red beans and rice with sausage and a large slab of cornbread. My brother had a muffaletta so big that if he held it up high enough, the sandwich would totally eclipse the sun. With our meals we each ordered a pint of Lazy Magnolia’s Reb Ale – served in Mason jars (a buddy of mine, also raised in the South said that he drank out of so many Mason jars growing up that his lips were threaded). Byron and I both agreed that it was one of the tastiest beers brewed in the region and I’ll be damned if it did not pare perfectly with our meals. Halfway thru our plates we rested to give our stomachs a break and each ordered a Magnolia Southern Pecan.

At our house we've been receiving a plethora of college mail for let's say the past six years with a one year break...However, just a heads up because it’s a little known fact that there is a severe punishment for your kids doing well on college assessment tests – it’s called mail overload.
“What’s going on?” he called from the porch, holding his lantern aloft, the light reaching out in a great circle.
Mike Jackson, Quechan Tribal President said opposition from the other California tribes has resulted in a delay of the project that will cost the tribe millions of dollars as well as hundreds of jobs. “We were told before it went to the Legislature there would be no opposition there, except from some from some of the urban tribes. At the time we didn’t understand the nature of their influence with key legislators." (Mike it’s called lobbying! Aren’t you following the Abramoff hearings?)
An aide to Cheney disclosed the surgery after it was complete. She said the ex-vice president, who has suffered five heart attacks over the years, had been waiting for a transplant for more than 20 months.

“Now, this little key here,” and he pointed to a key that was much smaller than the others, “Opens the little room at the end of the great ground floor corridor. Take your friends where you want, open any door you like, but not this one! Is that quite clear?” repeated Bluebeard. “Not this one! Nobody at all is allowed to enter that little room.”

This world of sorrow isn’t a place of God’s design. It’s the mess mankind made through disobedience and sin, ushering in death. One day, we have the opportunity to see what God’s perfect design is really like. Heaven is the ideal place, where death, crying, pain, and disease have no place because sin has no place.

What we do know about MD is that it's hereditary with a 50% chance of developing in those with a strong family history. We also know that smokers are at three times greater risk of developing MD and may show signs of the condition 10 years earlier than non smokers: but quitting smoking for 20 years reduces the risk to that of the normal population. We might not be able to change our genetics, but we can stop smoking or make sure our children never smoke!
I was sick last week. Like really sick. Apparently my low immune system means that when I get something like strep throat it really hits me hard. I seriously didn't get off the couch for almost three days straight. I only left the house one time between last Monday night and yesterday and that was to pick up my antibiotic at the pharmacy.I don't think I would have survived if my mom hadn't watched the boys for me last week though. She picked them up at school on Tuesday and kept them until Friday so I didn't have to deal with drop off and pick up each morning and afternoon. I'm feeling much better today, though I'm still a little tired. I guess that's what a fever, sore throat, and lymph nodes swollen to the size of house will do for you:)
It touches all of us in different ways in this family. One is quiet and thinks about it all a lot, one talks about it all a lot and writes about it and dreams about it and prays about it, is obsessed with not being obsessed with it. One is compassionate and patient and loving but also carries anger and fear, one just wonders what the heck is going on but I see the stress rise up in her spirit when the topic comes up or H arrives. She is on guard and watching. One is just done and disgusted and wants nothing to do with the whole mess.
Later during his questioning, Poe further challenged the Attorney General:
About 1km later, one of the pins on my bib came undone! While I stopped to fix it up another lady passed me. We had a brief chat, and then she pulled ahead. She told me that she did the 3 lap option the past couple of years, but that she is doing shorter events this year to try and develop some speed. I decided she’d be a good person for consistent pacing, and aimed maintain a reasonable gap.
Luckily, he made it to the pavement without hitting anyone. His final thought was about the safety of others. He never heard the screams and commotion that followed. The man who never had rolled the dice, never even tried, had lost.
To make syrup, heat water in a small sauce pan to boiling over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and whisk in the sugar. Place herbs in a satchel and dunk it down into the mixture. (If you don't have a satchel, you can just put the herbs directly into the pot and then strain them out out the syrup with a fine sieve. It's messy though!) Let the herbs infuse the mixture AT LEAST five minutes, or until it smells like ricola before removing the satchel. Maintain a low boil until the liquid reduces and the mixture becomes syrupy. Remove from heat and let cool. It'll last for several weeks in a covered jar in the refrigerator.

Beth looks like a quintessential vegan in her photo and she uses wholesome organic free range things. She is not a vegan but her vegetarian and vegan choices are all something that I would love to have placed in front of me on a regular basis. I checked out her website for her graphic art and was most impressed. Funky, Retro and very Vegan in flavour and by the look of it, an up and coming force in the graphic art world. Good luck Beth and cheers for the delicious recipes. Here’s the graphic art design website if you want to check out Beth and her hubby’s art work

SAN ANTONIO - Ranger Creek is releasing a new series of limited-run beers named RE:SESSION, with the first two beers available now at select locations in San Antonio, Austin and Houston.
My other childhood daydream was about a garbage truck. It didn’t have garbage though. Inside the truck was an underwater village. I remember I’d be in scuba gear. I would approach a door. It would open. Inside was another door. The first door would close. The water would be drained, then I’ll enter the second door. The second door was the real entrance to the house.
I wonder how many would admit to another person or themselves that they are as horny as hell and they can’t take it anymore. How many would admit to seeing a hot guy/girl and for a long few seconds entertain the thought of a quick fiery quenching moment of passion or lust. Speaking of lust, which means a passionate or overmastering desire or craving, that word has been vilified in the bible and there is a clear understanding why. However, he who has never felt lust (repeatedly) cast the first stone. The issue is lust comes with sexual desire because it’s a normal part of life. When was the last time you looked at the opposite sex and the only things that were stirred up within yourself were the very basic of emotions. By the way, I would hope married couples have some of that in their marriage to keep the fire burning.
The older Margareta promised the little girl that she would never neglect or leave her. As Margareta danced, she whispered out loud to herself, "I cannot stop or save you from the hardships of life, but I want to be with you, and I hope you will be with me in my hardships, okay? We need each other." The two agreed to meet often. She hoped the man hadn't overhead her promise to herself.
That risk I took way back then when everyone told me not to, it helped me to discover a whole new world. A new world where I became my own man. I discovered my own interests and lived every day full of life and enchantment with that which surrounded me.

Today I received a begging letter from The Nature Conservancy, which described the Karner blue butterfly, and what they are doing to preserve it. I tossed the letter into the trash, then immediately fished it out. I’m familiar with blue wasps, and recently I saw a huge blue bee, but I had never seen a blue butterfly, and the thought captured my imagination.
I completely forgot who the director was till the credits, and I see ALEXANDER PAYNE (UCLA grad, I might add, my screenwriting alma mater). He did “Election,” “About Schmidt,” “Sideways.” I had been thinking: “Who the heck is doing impeccable scenes?” And I just broke out in this big smile because ALEXANDER PAYNE HAS ARRIVED! He has a much brighter view of humanity now! But he has retained all his dark humor and distinct style. Maybe he was “practicing” with all those other films, just like I believe Terrence Malick was “practicing” for “Tree of Life.”
As you all know I'm totally rubbish with my photo taking, but I have done my best to show you what I have inside my little store.

At the time, Rayanne and I were working a comedy club as comedians that I will call, “The Comedy Barrio” or Barrio for short. It was one of those interesting ‘ownership’ situations that can only happen in New York. The Comedy Barrio was above McCann’s pub. McCann’s pub owned the building and did the majority of its business. The pub was owned by an Irish ex-pat and was filled with a staff of illegal Irish-Irish folks working as its staff and bartenders. The bar was amazing, in the way only an Irish pub can be. The owner at McCann’s had always ‘rented’ the upstairs to a comedy club. It was originally run by a guy who ended up managing Dane Cook and Jay Mohr. When their careers got too big, he gave it up. Enter JC.

The Republicans will, sensibly enough, try to use this incident for political points. Of course, the same sort of things have (and will) happen under Republicans-excess and waste are clearly bi-partisan in nature. What we need is not people scoring easy political points but a significant effort to ensure that this sort of thing does not occur again. Or, more realistically, that efforts are taken to make such events less likely and to recover the lost money from the responsible parties.
Try interval training (shorter runs that mix in intense efforts with recovery) because studies have found these workouts burn more calories during and after exercise. It will hopefully help with getting bored, too. Because if you get bored, you’ll have a harder time going back.
I think this was a good stage to go through. I had been hurt, and I did need to self-protect. And. Now I know that my parents did their absolute best for me. Knowing what I do of their circumstances and antecedents, I think they did wonderfully well. I love my father’s enthusiasm for his work as a teacher, always seeking out new ways to engage with each child. Now he is retired, 86, still dancing.

Unfortunately, there were a couple of small inconsistencies in the book, such as people who had left the scene were suddenly back and the murder victim being first a woman and then a man. Also, this planet is part of the Federation and it clearly uses money. Apparently, they were able to sell food to other, presumably Federation member planets, for a tidy profit and so were in turn able to spend the money on the planet’s infrastructure. Riker is also thinking about buying local jewelry to Troi. The twist in the medical plot is also easy to figure out.
Towards the end of the 1860s Bismarck, with a view to cementing in place the Junker regime, toyed with the idea of massive nationalization of industry. This would reinforce the Reich and provide numerous sinecures to employ down-at-heel Junkers. He needed to pave the way for this 'one big trust' solution by re-engineering public opinion. He even offered Karl Marx the editorship of the Staatsanzeiger, the official organ of his regime. Karl Liebnecht's father William was to given the editorship of Germany's main conservative daily. That both self styled revolutionists rebuffed the offers is frankly irrelevant, more important is that the offer was made in the first place

That's frustrating. And it's made me enjoy the job a lot less, in recent weeks. Which I'm sure has made me less pleasant to be around, in some quarters. It's tough to buck up for another 55 hour work week when you're just not sure it's going to get you anywhere.

The comparison of the red line to the blue line is basically a ratio: Violence: (Prisoner/Violence) What’s wrong with that? This ratio has the convenient property of overstating the relationship between crime and the prison population. If violence declines, it affects both measures in a way that makes increases in imprisonment seem to be more important than they actually are. When violence declines, the blue line goes down, of course. But, since violence is the denominator of the red line, and a shrinking denominator makes a number bigger, the red line goes up by a similar proportion. Since Murray essentially counts violence multiple times, this approach guarantees that his argument that prison reduces crime is supported by the graphic regardless of what actually happens with imprisonment and violence. Beyond this deception, Roman argues that Murray's chart shows a troubling trend: declining economic returns on incarceration:
When I went for my first interview there, I didn’t clearly understand the agenting business. I had a notion, but in the meeting with Darley I realised I had to get the job. It sounded like such an exciting area of the business, and I wasn’t wrong.

The Young Women finished up a project at our house a few days before Christmas. They were Secret Santas for some people in the ward. They never did reveal themselves, so if you read this and you are in our ward, please keep it a secret. The Young Women want it that way. Each week they wrote their person a Christmas card and I mailed it. They also made fabric covered notebooks. They were so excited to see one man at church with his notebook! It just made their day. I was so happy to see the Young Women so excited to give. I don't think that I found happiness in giving until I was older.
The NFL, and the public in general, can no longer sit back and allow players to inflict damage upon each other without mandating equipment designed to protect the brain and other parts of the body.

So we derive that there is a parallel relation that exists between marketing and fashion as they both strive to achieve the same thing. Loyalty. Loyalty is the aim of every business and marketers should place emphasis on maintaining loyalty from their core customers. However in a business model it is much more difficult to maintain loyalty due the increase in competition and the on going fight for a share in the consumers mind. Marketers need to develop new trends and tactics in reaching maximum consumers or revamp old trends that would fit appropriately to their business.

Refugees do not come from such backgrounds. The levels of adjustment they, and those who try to help them, must make are enormous. They will not necessarily be accommodating. They will expect to be accommodated. They will often want to cling to some of their familiar things. Their routines, their food and the dietary rules surrounding it, their prayer times (and a quiet place to do this), their language and their ways of doing things. Some will have serious emotional issues. They may want to seek out people who come from the same parts of the world as themselves.

After about 45 minutes, Sean decided all was well with basic laptop functions and memory so he transferred me to 'Vinnie' (in networking) who (after listening to me explain yet again that the WLAN card wasn't working properly causing the laptop to crash several times daily) had me download & run two programs: one to install a new driver for my malfunctioning WLAN card and the other to 'flash my BIOS' from A08 to A09.

Had some fab things including a bracelet I'd chosen, toiletries, pretty things and lovely books; Monty Don's latest gardening book and an Amish Bakery book which I can't wait to try things out of: Chocolate Chip Pie anyone? Tim and I went out for lunch at The Mole in Toot Baldon. You couldn't make those names up could you but the food and the setting of tables in a pretty courtyard garden where we ate in the warm sunshine was just lovely. A super birthday treat and we came home via the supermarket to choose a cake for my birthday ( no I didn't make my own!!) to share with the boys when they came home from school. We'll do a family birthday outing at the weekend.

Stone's anniversary beers have tended to be towards IPAs and DIPAs that the west coast brewer is known for, but this year they changed things up and went with a chocolate oatmeal stout. I am sure hop prices may have also had something to do with this as well. This is actually the combination of two different beer recipes. The first being an imperial stout and the other being an oatmeal stout. The original formulation called for Oaxacan chocolate, but I am sure the price of that kept it from being brewed for the masses and they still went with unsweetened cocoa added to the boil. It would be really cool to be able to have a vertical of the original home brew recipe and the final product.

What does this mean? One reason for accepting the B theory of time theologically is just that the A theory, even when it is presented in its most sophisticated forms, poses an indissoluble logical challenge to divine simplicity. It entails that God can learn propositions over time (namely, God learns that some tensed proposition, such as “it is now February 14th” is true as it becomes true). However, if what I have said above about omniscience is true, then it seems as though God could have learnt the proposition “God is omnipresent” at the moment of creation, such that, although there was never a time at which God did not know the proposition “God is omnipresent”, God still did not know the proposition “God is omnipresent” absent creation. There may be a good argument here to say that propositions are just contingent on creation.

The Seventh Sign is the first of a handful of late ‘80’s-early ‘90’s films that were popular with customers back in the days when my mother owned a video store. I do not recall this one ever being considering a classic among renters aside from the Demi moore nude scene. I have never been a big Moore fan, but after having seen her naked numerous times before watching this film for the first time, I am not hugely impressed by her early skin exposure. It does not elevate the film any.
The South African government barely blinked when that report was made.

I always look forward to finding David's booth at the Bethesda art fair, checking out his new works and catching up. The skull is a recent work - I love his take on an edgy subject! His dynamic brushstrokes, wonderful impressionist quality and beautiful happy colors are what make his paintings so irresistible to me - they brighten any room. We're very proud to own one of his stunning works!

I really love writing things down, I love taking pen or pencil to paper. So I try and find more things to write down and find a reason I need 10 different empty notebooks.
Brands should want attention, welcome or otherwise. It’s what gets people to notice and be interested, and once you have that, you have the possibility of connection. Once you have connection, you can work your way up to loyalty. And that’s the shizz.
Later that night a group of us went out for dinner and drinks for my birthday. It was an awesome time and I felt blessed to get to be around such great people.
Research has been jarring for months on the novel I am developing for my final year dissertation project. I love literary criticism and breaking it down in itself, I love theory but would love to try it all out and see how it works in fictional practise. Gendered language as a prison of classification, and the reading of the diaries of French Herculine Barbin who was classified as a '19th Century Hermaphrodite' has brought me here to try and create a different ending than suicide.
This year I wanted to shake things up a bit because that is just what I do. I always change up something. I don't really follow recipes so I get to cook how I am feeling which is nice and luckily no one complains! Most dishes that I fix at Thanksgiving are fundamentally the same. A brined bird, cornbread stuffing with sage, mushroom gravy, sweet potatoes with marshmellows on top (I think this dish is nasty sweet and I will not eat it but it is one of the first things finished!), homemade rolls, and a few veggie side dishes like brussels sprouts, creamed spinach or green beans. Oh yeah, and chocolate pecan pie=total and complete YUM. There are flavor variations every year that differ. Pecans or sausage in the cornbread dressing, mushroom gravy with sage or thyme, pecan pie flavored with vanilla or rum and this year the sweet potatoes are getting a do over (those Marshmellows might have to go!)

Schrödinger wasn't saying that we have to believe that a cat can be dead and alive at the same time. He was saying that our current understanding of quantum physics suggests that the cat is dead and alive, which doesn't make sense, and either that therefore we haven't yet explained it properly, or that quantum science doesn't follow the rules of the rest of the universe. (Which we know is true - but we want to know what rules it follows.)

I was assigned to orient a new Per Diem nurse last night when I went to work. The orientee got a call from one of the units and had requested if nurses could go there to assess two female inmates who got into a minor scuffle. I offered a deal with her as we started dashing out into the hallway that led to that unit. I asked her if she wanted to take one and I would assess the other so she could start honing her skills without me always breathing on her neck. She willingly agreed, enthused with so many incidents happening that would help her learn more in the prison setting.

With this depressing weather. We actually got some surprising sunshine today, perfect for a homeschool group get together at the park which we usually skip in the winter months because I can't take standing in the rain for two hours while the kids run around like crazy sugar rushed maniacs. Insstead I convince them that it is better to go roller skating indoors, or anything indoors! I decided to try the park today only to find that the park was one big mud pit and Little L slipped and fell right smack dab in one of these lovely wet mud piles and was soaked right through two shirts and down to his underwear. He is basically a skeleton with skin he is so skinny, which is why he has a hard time riding this time of year, no matter how many layers I put on him he can't stay warm. So in tears we headed to the car where all I could find to warm him up was A.J's newly laundered, size 80 horse blanket in the back. Little L stripped down to his skivvies and wrapped up in the blanket while we waited an hour for his big brother to play with his friends.

I let out a relieved sigh as the timer counts down and the game draws to an end. I sit back and look at the twisting pathways my dwarves have constructed. A lake of lava sits dormant, having been rendered harmless by my intervention. And past that lake more tunnels extend. Because you always have to keep trying, keep pushing further beyond your limits and past failings, if you are ever going to succeed. Because that next uncharted cavern might just hold the gold mine you’ve been looking for, and you’ll never know unless you reach for it.
Was reminded how much I love pineapple, but I may have over done it as my mouth felt a bit raw.
This is the first time I've bought a used sewing machine and not been able to sew with her right off the bat -- disappointing, but I suppose it builds character. The seller said she sews and that's factually true but there's no way, judging from the condition she arrived in, that she was fully tested. They probably turned the light on, revved the motor, and called it a day.

It doesn’t mean you have to, either. You don’t have to care about advanced stats at all, but I’ll tell you from experience that they’re worth exploring, because they help explain so much (although, any stats head worth his or her salt will tell you that the numbers don’t tell the full story and that context is paramount). You don’t have to live and die by the numbers, and you can still watch and enjoy the game any way you like. There’s no right or wrong way to do that.

This was a tale of two cities, the best of times and the worst of times. At the beginning though it all seemed so simple. Everyone knew that Paris would win the right to stage the 2012 Olympic Games. The bid organisers had learned their lesson from four years earlier when they had been accused of arrogance and over-confidence, and had been eliminated at an early stage. This time the bid was slimmed down and thoroughly practical. And Paris was Paris, the home of the modern Olympic movement and the city that everyone loves to visit.

The new campaign launches this weekend, and it's based on the idea of slowing things down. I'm not yet convinced by this as a strategy for a mainstream premium lager - it feels more like ale or stout territory. But as this is what I used to do for a living, I can take a decent stab at post-rationalising how they got here.

The description was brief: the machine was in excellent condition (remember that word, excellent -- it's key) and worked perfectly. Well, yesterday I received the machine (from Canada -- I know, I know...). It was not in excellent condition; in fact, it was in -- at most -- fair condition, some might even say poor.
The most difficult part about all this is how I feel about it, psychologically. As I said, this has mostly been health-motivated. However, for reasons I've never really understood, once you lose a few pounds, people constantly tell you how "good" you look, which to me seems a bit backhanded. It's almost as though they're implying that when you were 20 lbs heavier, you were ugly as sin, which is not true. Some women look amazing carrying a few extra pounds. Need proof?

Mary Elizabeth Carroll married William Washington Knight in 1855, a union of two influential families in Lowndes and Berrien county histories (The Knights and the Carrolls were cut from Lowndes into Berrien County in 1856.) The bride was a petite dark-haired beauty of 16; the groom, at 26, was 6 feet in height, with dark hair and blue eyes. William was born 4 Mar 1829 in that part of Lowndes, Georgia that is now known as Berrien County, Ga. He was the eldest son of Levi Knight and Ann Clements/Herrin, and a grandson of William Anderson Knight.

The last time it was torture. They placed several needles up and down my arm and electrified them and measured the time it took the nerves to send messages… in other words – PAIN – to each other. This time? They will do both arms, across the shoulders and back. They want to measure from fingertip to fingertip, I guess looking to see what is Chiari related and what is due to the herniation? It’s all a bit foggy because I am clueless to medical jargon thrown at me a zillion miles an hour, and the meds I take make me forget that jargon nearly as fast as I hear it… so I can look it up easily later. But what I do get is that it is painfully clear that I will NOT like Friday’s appointment. Ah well… after it’s over, I will have info and maybe a better direction to go to have things moving forward and onward. I will be a better person for it later. Right? Just humor me here and nod convincingly.

Note that Craig calls Ehrman a “radical sceptic,” a label that Ehrman would deny but applies to mythicists like Carrier, who seem intransigent in their scepticism. Craig then goes on to dissect and (to his mind) demolish Law’s argument (you can review Law’s six premises to be skeptical about Jesus here). Recall Law’s premise 6:
Um, I kind of need to “go poo-pees.” Can I just, uh, hmm.

What is being done behind the scenes, and the work that is being done in awakening people’s hearts and minds and bodies to the wonder of who they are, and to the wonder of each other, the shift, to stop being defensive and in fear, to the deep desire and passion to be in community and unity and sacred union—never before have we heard such a consistent plea and prayer from the human collective as to be in the unity of sacred union, of partnership, with one another.
I got a couple of tarts at a little shop in Bologna that had a pastry cup, filled with a lemon custard and then fresh fruit on top. I had a strawberry tart and a blackberry tart, and I wish I could eat one of those every day, because I totally would, and they were only 1 Euro! Bargain!

I have enough evidence of them doing so to know that this is true. I've heard Sylvia repeat back things I've taught her to friends, Riley becomes very anxious at the thought of not doing anything exactly as directed. Other people tell me things the girls have told them which come straight from me. They are incredibly good about asking permission for anything they want to do that I've not expressly said they could do at any time. They are both very good girls.
In this limbo situation, think then of those Tamil families whose kinspersons lay commemorated in the tuyilam illam as fighters in a lost cause. The epitaphs serve as concrete links to loved ones. Standing in 2010 each epitaph would tell a surviving member of the family that their kinsperson had died in vain. The epitaphs, therefore, had the potential to stand as a monument to the futility of the LTTE enterprise rather than the other way round. This conclusion would have been further animated by the experiences of those who walked through the shadows and shrubs of death in the north-eastern corner of the Vanni in early 2009. Those who had come to hate the LTTE during that inferno would have their thoughts consolidated by the epitaphs documenting the martyrdom of their Tiger kin of the recent past.
Firstly, a person must choose between living his life according to God’s word or living his life according to the world.
In the introduction we were all told that at the recent UAF Wales conference Peter Hain was elected as the Honoury President. This is the same Peter Hain who has served in the Labour cabinet as both Work and Pensions Secretary and the Secretary of State for Wales for a government which has attacked the working class continuously. This is not inconsequential because if we do not recognise the reasons why voters are turning to the BNP then we might as well not bother fighting it. It is clear that there is racism involved in the rise of the BNP, but it is not the sole reason,it is also because of the social deprivation and the betrayals of the Labour Party towards the working class. So we have a situation where many voters are turning to the BNP because of the policies of the Labour Party and the biggest anti-fascist organisation campaigning against this is headed by a former government minister, what a sick joke.
My daughter received an Easter present from my sister the other day–the movie Hop. First off, this was a very nice gift and my daughter (who is two) thoroughly enjoyed the bunnies and chicks and action sequences. My wife and I, however, having now seen the movie twice now in as many days, have been left with a rather confounding question: Who on Earth thought this movie was a good idea?

As this week has been quite busy for me and although I stayed at home on said day it was to work and not play, a proper labour day. And every time I look out my window no lovely little birch-tree reminds me that I am loved, not even a branch telling me I’m liked. Sadly playing has to wait for a while, I even had to move my flight to Hamburg from yesterday to Saturday morning, and work is the what I have to do from morn till night. But as I sit at my desk and pretend to be a grown-up I can’t help my mind from straying and wanting to bunk off.

Have you ever wondered if your being verbally abused by your spouse? Do you get yelled at for expressing your feelings? Are you constantly being criticized? Or, being called names? When you cry — does your spouse laugh? Have you been told your something your not? When you tell your spouse “I feel – or I need,” does he/she always in some way revert the conversation back to himself or her? Well if you have answered yes, to any one of these questions, then you are being “verbally abused!”

2. Just before this afternoon’s performance I pulled out the iPod and opened up my budgeting app to review my expenses from the last quarter. I scrolled through the categories and congratulated myself for having come out under budget by restricting my restaurant visits, mending worn clothing, and avoiding unnecessary purchases.

And it was over. Final. We all made our way back out of the courtroom, down the narrow hall, and to the waiting area. Now we were laughing, talking, taking pictures, and hugging.

In spite of their differences, Belloc's and Baring's friendship was cemented by mutual respect. "I like him immensely and think him full of brilliances and delightful to be with," Baring wrote of Belloc three years later. At this stage, however, Baring did not feel tempted to succumb to the allure of Belloc's faith. When his friend Reggie Balfour informed him in the autumn of 1899 that he "felt a strong desire to become a Catholic," Baring was "extremely surprised and disconcerted." Until that moment, he had only known two converts – his sister Elizabeth, who had married the Catholic earl of Kenmare, and an undergraduate who had explained his motive merely as a need to have all or nothing. He was "amazed" that his friend should consider such a step and sought to discourage him, arguing that the Christian religion "was not so very old, and so small a strip in the illimitable series of the creeds of mankind." Out of loyalty to his friend, simple curiosity, or both, Baring accompanied Balfour to a Low Mass. He was pleasantly surprised: "It impressed me greatly… One felt one was looking on at something extremely ancient. The behaviour of the congregation, and the expression on their faces impressed me too. To them it was evidently real."

Luis got his initials L and C tattooed in Old English on both of his arms. He told me that there is no real meaning behind it, it is just his initials. Luis said that he will add angel wings on it, since his middle name is Angel. I am looking forward to see how will it look like. It will be an interesting tattoo, three names, where one of them will be illustrated. Cool!

As Fox News’ Doug McKelway wrote in August 2011, “Obama has suggested that blame for the stagnant U.S. economy lies in places other than the Oval office. The latest example occurred Monday when the President said, “There will always be economic factors that we can’t control, earthquakes, spikes in oil prices, slowdowns in other parts of the world.”
History books have relatively little personal information on lincoln’s childhood years. I built the story around the few facts I did find—lincoln family history, pioneer farm, knowledge that abe worked hard and went to school, small descriptionsof his personality and physical appearance to name a few.

A new Planned Parenthood clinic opened in Ferndale officially today. And of course, what should be a momentous occasion for affordable and reliable healthcare in the Metro Detroit area, was marred by protesters who are more interested in their ideology, than the practicality of the thing they are protesting against. I really don’t understand this sudden and unbelievable war on women that’s going on in our country and I certainly don’t understand the backlash against Planned Parenthood. So much of what they do, a vast vast vast majority of what they do is basic healthcare for women, that a great number of locations don’t even perform abortions. But still, in droves these zombies show up to protest against, what one would think, is a basic right for women.

I saw this trailer last night at Think Like a Man decided to share it. Mostly because I am thoroughly happy to see Shia Labeouf back at work again. I have a tube crush on this guy and had been missing his face. But back to Lawless. Lawless has an impressive line up (Hardy, Oldman, Pearce, Labeouf, there are more but those are the ones I recognized immediately), set during the Prohibition and plenty of Tommy guns. Though I’m mostly invested in it because of Hardy and Labeouf, the idea of it being a film version of Boardwalk (recently got into it) is another good reason to go check it out.

Lying on her back, she lets out a long sigh. “Dear Lord, Where is this incredible journey you have me on going to take me? You gave me the strength to escape my horrible marriage. You delivered me from cancer. Then you plop me into the middle of Tucker’s life. And now you’ve given me the blessing of April. Help me to not be selfish in my attitude and feelings toward this little angel. Give me wisdom to know what to do and say with her. And protect us all. In Jesus name, Amen.”
One of the most difficult birds for me to photograph are the jet black species such as crows, ravens, and Red-winged blackbirds. In these early days of spring, the American robins and RWblackbirds are about all you see, true harbingers of the season. How do you balance the over saturated red and yellow shoulder patches with the light killing depths of the black body? One answer is to wait for the perfect cloudy day or...ignore those dramatic dynamics and concentrate on the subtle colors of the gentler members of the harem when they pop out of the reed beds and show themselves. I could pretend to express a personal preference for these well camouflaged, sparrow colored ladies, but the truth is the guys are generally a little to tough to handle. My virtual waste basket is stuffed with near misses. The perfectly exposed, dramatically posed, male Red-winged black bird photo remains a rare treasure and a worthy quest.
This really is proving hard to deal with and at times I feel that I am almost a spectator in my life. When I am talking to people it’s like I am going through the motions but my mind is elsewhere and I am only giving the task at hand 20% of my concentration. My thought processes seem slow and overwhelmed. It really does feel like I am somewhere else in my mind. It feels like I am having an out of body experience a lot of the time. If I think about the things that are going on to much I end up fighting back the tears.
Of all that I could ask for
I have a busy week ahead. Tomorow I'm taking my Dad to the city to see his Oncologist. Can you believe it's 3 years ago this month he was diagnosed with cancer? Your prayer support and kind words during the dark days were so very much appreciated. He continues to be stable, and although he still has the tumour, it is dormant. We are hoping this will be the last visit to the city hospital, and his check-ups can continue more locally.
The idea of going back for possible survivors, he discloses, was not mooted. They were too far away from the wreck, in intense darkness, and it would have been a dangerous and futile gesture because no one could have survived the icy sea for more than 15 minutes. “Cosmo was in no position to give orders,” says Sir Andrew. “He was not in charge of the boat.”

This is bad news. I think I'm starting to get how it works; which is that, once a track's been on the play-out, it's doomed to never be on the show proper. Which presumably means Peter's had it.

The elites hope there is no threat from them and pretend they are essentially good and appeal to their good will by being nice to them,. hoping they will reciprocate by being nice back. This mentality was expressed neatly by Jens Orback, Sweden’s Minister of Democracy, “We must be open and tolerant towards Islam and Muslims because when we become a minority, they will be so towards us.”

Why fight 1 fight a year if you can fight 4 times a year without wearing yourself out? Also I have Jesse Vargas beating Ramon Montano. Vargas is very talented, I really hope this is a televised fight.

The End we are all looking for is in fellowship with Jesus, the grand Harmonizer of heaven and earth. And that end has no end. It wraps our crude thirst for survival into a greater story of redemption and permits us to enjoy all we sought after in our petty endings. The goal worth living for is found in His presence–and that place is beyond the reach of our earthly story arches’ endings.
Buttercup is an Aran cable scarflet I put together using Malabrigo worsted in Cadmium. This is a sensational color...naming her Buttercup is pretty self explanatory, although the aroma of buttery movie theater popcorn is tickling my senses as well.

From the looks of it so far, I won't be working tonight. Not unless we get at least 100 more reservations in the next 3 hours. Since the clouds are dumping snow everywhere, it's more likely that we will have cancellations, than bookings.

For the record, shaking up a beer while you run is not recommended. It gets very foamy, and makes you feel very bloated. Anyhow, with Tricia's injury, we knew the second half of the race might be a bit more relaxed. We ran the first 7, and then started instituting walk breaks. This is where it was kind of nice to relax for a minute, take a sip of carbs, and just generally chit-chat and enjoy the day. There was still way more running that walking, and I was super proud of Tricia for toughing it out despite being only trained up to 6 miles post-injury.

Binet tells the story of Operation Anthropoid, the assassination attempt on Reinhard Heydrich who was at the time the Nazi regime's Deputy Reichsprotektor of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. It was a story related to Binet when young by his father and one which he has always been fascinated by. Determined at last to try and find his own way of telling it he begins researching and writing his definitive account and we read this novel which is part-history, part-fiction, part-memoir, part-notebook.

What I’m most proud of is that I actually went shopping for shoes. My favorite line from my favorite movie Lonesome Dove was when Gus said Deets was “never one to quit on a garment just cuz it’s got a little age.” My thinking exactly – the older the better. But when when the rubber sole of your sneaker breaks on the calf machine at the gym, it’s time. So I got some really cute Nike training shoes with hot pink little shooshes on the side. Cute.
It is ironical that we are expanding our social security commitments at the very moment when rich countries are having to cut back. It is also ironical that we are seeking to extend controls of the labour market while Europeans are trying to make their labour markets more flexible.

Have you ever been really hungry? Have you ever had a craving for a certain kind of food? Hunger is a tremendous human drive. Jesus said that He was the “bread of life” and if we believe in Him, we won’t be hunger again. But He wasn’t talking about alleviating our physical hunger. Instead, Jesus is talking about another kind of hunger; a hunger just as real. It is a spiritual hunger, a hunger of the soul. Just like a physical hunger, you can have many soulful cravings. These craving come from the needs of our heart. You may have a taste for love to fill your heart. Many people have a hunger for inner peace, joy and happiness. There are also hungers that are born out of unfulfilled needs like a hunger for recognition, love and intimacy. Of course there are more base unspiritual appetites too, like lust, greed and materialism. Jesus knows our real hungers. He knows what will really satisfy our deepest needs. So today, hear the words of Jesus, “I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry.” Come to Jesus. Feed on His teachings and the personal relationship that He offers to you. He is the only one that can truly satisfy your hunger.
I know I have been harping the subject of NPD abusers as of late, and I promise this is the last for a while. I have a ton of anger associated with this subject. My Original Abuser (OA) has NPD. It is my family illness. It goes back generations and has infected hundreds in several states. As my counselor says, either you become one, or you become the antitheses of one. I am the latter. It seems to be my own personal hell to constantly come in contact with others with this disorder…girlfriends, teachers, bosses. In all this time dealing with them, I have one nagging question:
I could list the accomplishments of his life and tell you about all the other reasons he was an amazing force upon this earth. But words won't do him justice. He loved many and was loved by many. And that is an amazing legacy to leave behind.

Her idea of a cute, harmless, noiseless hamster turned into the thoughts of getting a ferret.

There is only one sense in which we can coherently say that our own phenomenal experiences are in any way similar to those of other conscious beings, such that we can grasp a link between intentionality (universal among all intelligent beings) and consciousness (unique to each conscious being). In this book I have emphasized the distinction between intentionality and consciousness. The last chapter will explore the connection between them.
Dancers’ bodies are their instruments; they know them down to the last bone and muscle fiber. A central part of a dancer’s everyday regime, company class offers them a chance to improve their technique. Each dancer has their own focus; perhaps a wobbly pirouette in last night’s performance that needs fixing, or a twinge in an ankle that signals an impending injury if not treated gently. Unlike an amateur ballet class where every student performs the same exercises in unison from beginning to end, these professionals tailor the class to suit the specific needs of their bodies.
Very different from standard MMO’s (WoW/SWTOR/Rift). So some things seem odd at first. And there is a TON of misinformation around. I’ve seen tons of it on all gamer boards I’ve looked at (Rift’s, SWTOR’s, mmo-champion, various).
What started me thinking about this idea and hence inspired this post was this excellent meditation by psychlinguist François Grosjean, PhD about people's proclivity to fall in love with certain languages and the cultures within which these languags exist. David Crystal added his thoughts here, putting forth that perhaps the analogy of the romantic love-affair isn't quite the right one, as it is possible to fall in love with multiple languages, as he has done, in your life. He suggests that perhaps the idea of parental love might be more appropriate, as his feelings for one language were not superceded by another. Corey Heller, founder of Multilingual Living, wrote about her experiences with the German language and culture as an American. She raises her children in the USA with her German husband within a German language environment and in her piece addresses her feeling of connection to her second language.
The best part for me was watching Aislinn grow. Throughout this series, she’s been tough at times, but mostly she’s flopped about trying to figure out her new role while keeping her true love with her. That’s pretty tough to do with the sexy and worldly Keenan tempting you and evil fae trying to kill or unseat you. But when both her love interests seemingly abandon her, she’s had it. And she takes action She’s determined to get her court back in order and to sort out her love life — no matter what. Yes, at times I found both Keenan and Seth exasperating and wished she’d dump both of ‘em (ditto for Donia), but in the end, Ash stays true to herself, as do the other characters.
Thirteen. Holding the unopened Gateway felt like trying to hang on to a wet bar of soap. She reached for another, connecting the ceiling of the tower to the same spot on the floor of the barn. As soon as the two Gates touched, end-to-end, they came alive.

(P. S. I laid that floor, too! All by myself. Without my handyman, or my husband. But that's another story. And we were able to add a cute little pantry around the corner from the fridge, by partitioning off the fridge inside the stairwell closet, and adding shelving. Now, when you open the door to what used to be a poorly functioning under stairway closet, you just see pantry shelving. More storage-- I love it!

It only took us 5 minutes to get to her school so we made it there before the movie started. We even had time for us to get some popcorn and water that the PTO was selling for a buck each and Emma was able to say hi to numerous teachers and a few friends. Then we made our way into the auditorium to find some seats. Emma wanted to sit with her friend Haily but the seat around her were all taken. Of course that lead to me being a mean mom and making Emma sit a few rows in front of her. At that moment I really considered turning around and going back home but I didn't. Eventually Emma quite pouting and watched the movie.

Then using the handle of a spoon, I made an indentation down each log and spooned in the preserves. Baked. Then drizzled with a mix of powdered sugar, lemon juice and vanilla. And they came out great. The glaze is very sweet, which nicely complements the buttery vanilla cookie and the slightly tart preserves. I’ll definitely make these again, despite my less-than-perfect experience.
Oh, study not God in the jewelled heavens—in the sublimity of the mountain—in the beauty of the vale—in the grandeur of the ocean—in the murmurs of the stream—in the music of the winds. God made all this, but all this is not God. Study Him in the cross of Jesus! Look at Him through this wondrous telescope, and although, as through a glass darkly, you behold His glory—the Godhead in awful eclipse, the Sun of His Deity setting in blood yet that rude and crimsoned cross more fully reveals the mind of God, more harmoniously discloses the perfections of God, and more per­fectly unveils the heart of God, and more fully exhibits the glory of God, than the combined power of ten thousand worlds like this, even though sin had never marred, and the curse had never blighted it. Study God in Christ, and Christ on the cross. Oh, the marvels that meet in it—the glory that gathers round it—the streams of blessing that flow from it—the deep, refreshing shadow it casts, in the happy expe­rience of all who look to Jesus and live—who look to Jesus and love—who look to Jesus and obey—who look to Jesus and embrace that blessed “hope of eternal life which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began.” (Ti. 1:2).
Paranormal
Peerless Japanese horror filmmaker Shinya Tsukamoto’s Haze navigates the tortured psyche of a man (Tsukamoto) struggling with his conscience after awakening to find himself trapped in a tunnel and covered in blood. The more lucid his conscience becomes, the more agonizing his ordeals become. Closer in spirit to Tetsuo than to Nightmare Detective, Haze is a virtual assault on the senses: wedged between narrow walls, forced to walk along barbed wire or struck repeatedly in the head by a hammer, with tight close-up’s of the victim’s grimacing perspiration soaked face, this Boschian descent into madness feels more like a sketch than a finished film. However, one iconic image that leaves an impression as indelible as the films of Bergman or Dreyer, a close-up of Tsukamoto’s weary face as he hears a woman’s (Kaori Fujii) remorseful voice shortly before the film’s ambiguous conclusion, of itself is worth the price of admission. Odd that the digital medium, which Tsukamoto found to be so liberating, should produce the most claustrophobic work of his career. Lighting, editing and sound design are all top-notch, but the otherwise beautiful image is all too often noisy and grainy. There is also an extended 49-minute version of this film. (7/10)

Honestly, I think writers would sell for whatever the market perceives is reasonable, whether it’s $1.99 or $9.99. The problem of course is making headway in a glutted market. It’s not like there is limited store space. There is no scarcity of supply in the digital book world. Demand, of course, is limited. There are only so many readers out there. In this scenario, there is going to always be downward pressure toward zero. If we want to alleviate this pressure, two major issues have to be addressed.

As you know,
First to speak after the coffee break in today's Music and IP conference was Rebecca Dimaridis (Jeffrey Green Russell), on the topic "Infringement -- has the Same Old Tune Changed?". This was an analysis of the question whether an old song, "Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree", was infringed by Men at Work's song "Down Under" (see earlier blog posts here and here). Rebecca treated the conference participants to sound clips of the two works before feeding the notes into the court's legal reasoning. The court's finding that there had been an objective similarity between them was strengthened by the frank admission of musician Colin Hay that there was indeed a causal connection between the two works.
I had fully intended to write about the love making session last Thursday in this post, but the events of Thursday were outdone by a divinely erotic experience on Friday. So in the interest of sharing the delightful details of Friday, I will forego the description of our lovemaking. Suffice to say it was indeed very intense and passionate, which as I said a moment ago set up the events of the following day.

You babble, and babble, and babble some more. All day long! I love listening to you talk in your own little language. Your only consistent words at this point are mama, dada, rah-rah (Charlee), and hi or hey. However, there are times you have an occasional new word that pops up a few times and then doesn't get said again. You love making a "lah-lah-lah-lah" sound.
There are two further social history facts that further suggest to me that honor killing as a tradition does not arise either from Islam or from its initial contemporary environment of seventh-century Arabia. The first is that we have evidence of honor killings arising throughout Central and South Asia, often spanning ethnic and religious communities. The cases that I am aware of in which such killings were given legal sanction arise out of highly stratified societies, such as Medieval Persia, and were generally tied to issues of marriage and inheritances. The Medieval Persian empire of the Sassanians was, according to its laws, so preoccupied with maintaining the wealth of its upper class that not only did it sanction honor killings, it also often legally required incest (or, at least, marriages of incest), in order to prevent anyone outside of the upper class from inheriting their wealth. Of course, most scholars assume that these laws were followed on paper only, and that alternate arrangements were made in practice, but it does highlight the essential link between the concept of honor killings and social class.

NAMA wants the transaction reversed, Johnny and Richard say the transaction was at open market values is all above board.

Within the current system, protection is in place for employers to prevent any excessive costs of litigation. Employers can, for example, prevent escalating costs by making a reasonable offer to the injured party. And, at the end of a case, can get the costs assessed by a judge, who will not allow the claimant to recover costs which have been unreasonably incurred, or are unreasonable in amount.

A nasty story. “Typical young Nazi thugs,” may be your response to the way Grass and his mates treated the boy they had come to call ”Wedontdothat”. But I wonder: might he not have been given as hard a time by his mates in a British barracks? How would a boy who proclaimed himself a pacifist and conscientious objector have been treated in one of our tougher public schools at any stage of the war?

However…I doubt my school would allow me to register for 9 classes. I believe they max registration at 6 classes unless you submit an appeal and have it approved. They would never approve mine.

History has proved that the unjust conquering of lands alienates the conquerors from the conquered. In the entire history of the world no nation has been able to impose its will on a people to the extent that the people themselves freely leave their own culture and nationality, and adopt freely the will of the conqueror. The Greeks, Romans, Nazis, British, French, Italians, and so on, all tried and all failed. In recent times we have seen countless examples of nations fighting for their independence and freedom from imperialism. The conquerors have always sought to dominate and the conquered have always been treated as second-class citizens.

Perhaps it was sound of feet running up and down the steps, that could be heard even when nobody was in fact running up them. The creaky second step was always skipped over when one was trying to move around the stairs quietly; and whenever stepped on, was an announcement to all that somebody was coming upstairs.
The subject this week is a thing called The Groovy Show, one of those long-gone dancing & variety shows where some adult host would spin young folk's records while trying not to look severely out of place amid dancing teens.

I made it for a Mothers Day lunch at my parents' house today. I baked it first thing yesterday morning before we were out and about. It has been a busy weekend with a visit to the Collingwood Children's Farm Farmer's Market, a trip to the cinema to see a rather silly movie called Dark Shadows, my niece's first communion mass, and today's family lunch.
Before I tackle some of the questions that I've gotten, with the help of the rest of the design team, let me show you the difference just a bit of shading makes. The monsters, colored and blended before I went through and added the shading came out pretty cute. In fact, I left one unshaded just to show you that if you aren't comfortable tackling that part of this technique, you can still get good results without it.
In mid '67 the band traveled up to Philadelphia to re-cut both tracks in an real recording studio. The result, released on the Strata label, is a perfectly realized two sided Garage-Soul stomper. Unfortunately, that didn't stop the record from quickly sinking into obscurity during "The Summer of Love".

For the first time in my mid-20’s, I started to taste the fiery kimchee soaked condiments and egg smothered bim bap in Korean restaurants, as well as barbecued eel, sushi and sashimi from Japanese restaurants and curries from Malayasian eateries.

Went for a walk during Sunday School because Haily, Daniel, Dan, and Stori needed some air. I stressed about being late for Relief Society because I conducted. :)
I don't want this project to be about dressing like the things on the cover of the book, so I've not done my hair like the little wolfette there, and though I thought a reference to the titular story would have been clever with a pair of penny loafers (when I read the line about not chewing on your loafers in it, I thought about how I was keeping myself from doing that very same thing all the way through my uniformed school-days in knee socks) something about the fusty-ness of wingtips goes better, somehow, with the typeface on the book.
Our little shopping trip was also enlightening and it was a perfect example of what we are talking about. As we shopped we would take turns saying, "Oh look at this," or "I really like this." The other two may or may agree, but it was so typical of how we are all different. To have grown up in the same home with the same influences, our individual tastes are vastly different. That's because we are different. We have different personalities/temperaments, body styles, and coloring. We are each so uniquely special and different.

I had earned my Bachelor of Science degree in nursing and had received additional certification in the nursing field. 15 years ago, I was working as a Certified Case Management Nurse for people who had suffered severe, life altering trauma. I was working every day in “The Big Apple” in the heart of Midtown Manhattan! I left home at 4:45 AM and returned home at 6:45 PM (on a good day)! I crammed life with my children into the few paltry hours that I had remaining! Quality time with my husband was a distant memory. Spending time with my parents was not in the cards!

In the four television weeks starting March 19, NBC lost an average of 59,000 viewers (about 3 percent) in that 18-to-49 age category compared with the same period last year, CBS lost 239,000 (8 percent), ABC lost 681,000 (21 percent) and Fox lost 709,000 (20 percent).

I hope you’re having a great week. I know a lot are enjoying spring break. I’m looking forward to the upcoming Easter weekend. Carlin’s parents will be here on Friday on their way back from Florida (they are becoming snow-birds). Then on Sunday, we will celebrate Christ’s resurrection by attending church and having brunch with my family.
The first time I saw her was in ‘Video Games‘. It was a blurry moment, you know, when the TV’s on but no one’s really watching. Then I came across a newspaper article speculating on her authenticity; that she’s just another industry-made produce to brainwash you into profiting her label company. But then, now that I think about it, they do the same thing over in Korea with K-pop, so I guess it’s okay, right? Whatever, I believe in genuine artistry so call me a sad sack for being more than iffy about the subject.
The group said the protests were meant as a sign of gratitude for the workers and to express solidarity with those who had been sacked from their jobs after last year protests.
In the end, I guess I did not really agree to medicine. I chose it over and above my desire to be, well, everything else, as well as my desire to be with my family, to be home, to travel the world, and, most importantly, to earn my own living. It’s killing me to have to depend on other people for finances, haha. Medicine allows me to understand even if I cannot do anything about it, to do something about it even if I know I’m going to fail, to fail as long as I tried anyway but still understanding where I went wrong so I don’t make the same mistake again. So, during the times I get frustrated with it, this is what I tell myself, repeatedly – I chose this over and above everything else so, honey, kindly don’t screw it up.
The graphics are predominantly bright and cheery, which makes a nice companion to parts in the story that are less cheerful. The charas can provide Amu (and anyone else with charas) support by changing their character - something about the character changes: for Amu it's her hair slide which changes to the suit of cards each chara represents. There are character transformations (in line with other Magical Girl genre anime shows). These are incredible. I love the video sequences in the transformations, and the music. It's so easy to imagine being Amu and merging with her Chara's.

Jim has a rule, which demands that one listen to a recording at least three times before consigning lesser works to eBay (or wherever those thousands of CDs go each year.) I’m impulsive. If something doesn’t grab me immediately, I’ve been known to hit the eject button and move on to something else. Lullaby For Liquid Pig is not an easy first listen. Maybe it’s the sequencing, but the three initial songs killed the album for me the first time around. And while it picks up considerably from there, I didn’t give the record a chance. That’s a shameful admission, particularly from someone who prides himself on his musical tastes, because LFLP is a pretty good disc. While not quite approaching the caliber of Lisa’s groundbreaking 4AD LPs, it does maintain an appealing unsteady quality throughout, and the tunes are definitely there, although she occasionally buries her hooks beneath provisional-sounding—and surely intentional—home-studio dissonance (especially on those first three tracks, which are, of course, my favorites now.) Another thing I was wrong about: Lisa’s still self-deprecating (a rare quality in the overweening world of Pop,) and she’s still, at times, terribly funny.

There are four strands to the story the first of which, under the chapters titled 'Sam', concerns an academic returning to his native South Africa to write the biography of Clare Wald, a successful writer with a complex personal and family history. Then we have the strand from which the novel takes its title, and which we later learn is a 'fictionalised memoir' written by Clare about a break-in at her house and its aftermath. Then comes a first-person narration about Clare's daughter, Laura, who has been missing for many years. And finally a flashback to 1989 told from Sam's point of view. Weaving these strands together Flanery does a good job at holding back information to keep even those readers who cannot help but puzzle-solve as they go through occupied until the final chapters.

Years ago, I visited a large ministry in southern Florida. A bit shocked, I listened as the director of the ministry spoke to her fellow volunteers. She was more than stern as the men and women listened. They nodded and smiled, agreeing with her admonitions. After the meeting, I asked her how she could be so stern with her volunteers. ”I’m also a volunteer,” she said, laughing. ”My teachers know that I am doing as much or more than they are every day of the week.”

And the reasons why conservatives are cautious about change SHOULD be universally known. The horrors that the abrupt, theory-loving French revolution inflicted on its people are still not totally forgotten and, if they were, the megadeaths caused by the evil twins of the 20th century -- Fascism and Communism -- should alert us to the dangers of radical transformations of society. "It couldn't happen to us" seems, however, to be a universal human fallacy so it may be of some interest to look at a summary of some recent AMERICAN experiences with the disastrous consequences of radical change. The essay concerned is in my view one of the best arguments for caution about change since Burke. Do read it.

“There is a world of difference between a sculptural chair and one designed to be sat in. Sculptural accessories need only be functional in the most abstract sense of similarity to the object being depicted. The visitor to the museum exhibition of crafted teacups quickly realises that no one would use them as teacups, especially since they are so expensive. They are designed as art objects to be seen and admired. This is a good model for the fine arts but an unsatisfactory one for an applied art such as architecture”

WordPress blogs are great because they have wonderful statistics sections that one can peruse over for days, matching the number of hits against the popularity of some posts against others. This is one of my biggest distractions. Now, back in the day when this blog started I used to complain over the difference between a fourteen hit day and a sixteen hit day, these days it’s more like …eh, 34 against 36…maybe. Anyway, the hit count is a distraction. The only way I see my hit count staying regularly high is to post regularly, and that’s another distraction.

In the spring of 1981, Kansas City had an NBA basketball team. Today they are known as the Sacramento Kings, then they were the Kansas City Kings.

I got a ticket to one of the games and the Kings won ( actually only game of the series they were to win ).

I stamped the image on Very Vanilla card and coloured with markers, adding some glitter to the centre of the flowers for a bit of sparkle. The sentiment was stamped on Crumb Cake and cut into a banner shape. The Blushing Bride background was stamped with the Music Notes wheel. I added some lace trim, Blushing Bride pleated ribbon, buttons and some butterflies with rhinestones to embellish.
You will see that you have made changes to others and influenced them just by being that love. It resonates and interacts with all. Negative will fade and positive will be strengthened. Dark will be transmuted into light. In working on your self-love you will bring great benefits to all and first of all your own being. So try to ponder on what it is that you not like or hate in being you. Write it down. Look at it. Feel it in you and say it is loved and will ever be loved by you. Feel that Self Love and know it is part of you.

Imagine a rotten little cargo ship, bobbing in the Atlantic. The night’s been a dramatic one for all aboard, and it’s not yet dawn when they gather on-deck, disheveled, confused, and now blinded by a great light from above. It’s the glow from an immense luxury liner, several storeys tall and dwarfing their craft. Row after row after row of wealthy gawkers line its railings, looking down at the ship’s measly crew like spectators in the Coliseum. The crew, who’ve spent nearly two hours of film-time scuttling through the bowels of their ship, committing debaucheries and big betrayals, seem minor now, as do the stakes they struggled over. Their debaucheries were petty; their betrayals netted tiny gains. Those of us in the audience knew it all along, and now the people aboard this luxury liner—an audience within the film—know it too. They stand in for us.

Even more impressive is that Stafford has put up numbers without a reliable running game this season. With Jahvid Best’s concussion issues, the Lions haven’t really had a go-to back and have been forced to air it out in a majority of their games. The offensive line has come up big in pass pro to help Stafford. It also helps when Stafford can throw to one of the best receivers in the league in Calvin Johnson.
The following Monday (which also happened to be my birthday...43...yee fucking haw) rolled around, and he called just like he said he would. His number landed exactly where I was hoping it would, and so we are definitely going with him and his agency to list.

After doing all that walking we decided to treat ourselves. For my first ever churro this one was pretty damn good.

You have to go back almost ten years for the last Shamrock Rovers win in Turners Cross, though this is the first time since their relegation that Cork City will have played Rovers with their visitors as the top dogs in Ireland. City yet to register a point this season, while Rovers have the maximum so far.

This is an encouraging sign, and one that is replicating throughout austerity-ridden economies the world over. International currencies are increasingly being rejected in the face of reduced living standards through inflation and outright theft by global banksters.
City or Country: This is probably one of the things that scares people away from first person reenacting the most, having to decided where to be from. I will let you in on a little secret, unless you are in a very organized event, with a focused time & location, no one really cares where you choose to be from!

It does taste like mango! It’s odd, really, how much it tastes and feels like mango. After chewing a little bit, the mango gives way to a more standard nectarine flavor, but when you first bite down, you realize instantly how perfectly the fruit is named.

‘I do, too.’ I smiled at him, feeling something plop inside me when I looked into the light-brown eyes of his. Like a bubble bursting, I think. A bubble of sheer happiness, love, and promise of a better future. It was completely impossible not to cry at a moment like this, so I guess the tears that had gathered beneath my eyelids weren’t that big a problem.

Grief is synonymous with change, and change means discomfort, or an absence of comfort. Let me know your views on coping with grief and loss – whatever the loss may be. If it’s a personal loss you are feeling, I wish you strength and peace. Consider writing about your experience as this can often help us heal. Please be well and take good care.
For this reason, the work most cited in discussions of O’Sullivan is the Inscription Rock, 1873 which was in the Smart show. The photo shows an old Spanish inscription, but more importantly shows a ruler, a measure that could be recognized, nature and the west was brought down to a recognizable size.

The next day I drove through the adorable little town of Dixon. It’s full of old adobe houses that are trying to crumble, but their owners are fighting back gamely and filling the yards with flowers. I turned on the last road in town and started heading uphill. After about five miles, there were no more houses or ranches, and I was wondering if I’d taken the correct turn. I followed the directions as best I could. 30 minutes and one narrow canyon road later, I turned onto the road across from the Buddhist prayer flags.

I really loved reading all your comments about your craft space. 30 boxes is certainly not a lot when moving a house but we are seriously getting rid of EVERYTHING!!! We really didn't have much to begin with because we have moved so much that we just got tired of buying stuff just to get rid of when we moved OR have to deal with moving.

I don't have a powder room at CDLV, and most people with houses built prior to 1960 don't, unless they or a prior owner retrofitted a hall closet, or kitchen pantry, thereby rendering them without a place to hang coats, or store food. But, many of you have powder rooms, or some sort of secondary bath reserved for guests. This week is for you!
A stroll past those two summer street fair on both 5th and 7th Avenue made up for all the hardship accompanied in living in the Slope. Just walking all the way down to Crown Heights and seeing the differences in worlds was an eye-opener to me. Sometimes you simply know when you fit into a hood and when you don’t. I like to believe I have found my perfect match just here, in the quiet, overpriced Slope!

Today was a good day. It started with sleeping in, and then making breakfast for my wife and daughter. As we were finishing breakfast, high winds caused a power outage at the house. So Julie and JoAnn took a nap while I went to check out a creek I’ve been wanting to fish. Steep banks and lots of vegetation and tree roots made casting a little difficult, but also provided a good break from the wind. I threw several flies, but my single fish brought to hand was on a chartreuse Black Ghost (quickly becoming my favorite fly).

The slush pile is a mysterious and often magical place. It’s a rowdy room full of new characters, each holding their breath inside the written pages as they wait for their stories to be uncovered. Sometimes the stories aren’t ready, or they’re rushed, or not quite polished enough to be set free. But it’s a process, this creating new worlds business, and there’s little doubt that with perseverance and revision each story can find its voice ready to be heard.

I came acrossThe Vaccine Book by Dr. Sears. For me it was like an answer to prayer (well it was an answer to prayer), because it presents the information in a reasonable, unbiased manner.

France had significant interest in halting the growth of the United States. America’s rate of expansion and power was threatening to the other world powers. If Napoleon was successful in conquering Mexico, then he saw great opportunity by either marching north to directly aid the Confederacy or by supplying the rebels with arms and other supplies.
I thought they did a pretty decent job with the story, at least at first glance. On further analysis when we got home, however, Kevin and I went back over it and realized that we were both disappointed in certain things that were changed or ever left out of the movie – for instance, in the book, Buttercup, the cat Katniss hates, is described as an ugly yellow cat. In the movie, the cat is black and white. Kevin thought this was laziness on the movie-makers’ part. ”Would it have been so hard for them to find a yellow cat?” he asked. Katniss’s acquisition of the Mockingjay pin is different in the movie version than the book version. Her whole ordeal of nearly dying of thirst in the beginning of the Games is completely left out.

Lead author Els van der Helm comments:
A sidenote: In Nordic mythology we hear about the same functions but in a different shape: Satan, the snake has been replaced by Fenrir, the wolf. This supports my idea and the interpretation of better scholars, that we choose a dangerous animal as the avatar of a malevolant god. Avatar is roughly one earthly body of a god in Hindu understanding of the word. We will return to this example later.
Such a profound statement.
Unfortunately for the Yankees, Whitey Ford, starter in Game 6, didn’t get the memo. He struck out the leadoff man in the 2nd, but then surrendered three singles in a row followed by a walk, prompting manager Casey Stengel to yank him. With Ford done for the game, the Yankees relied on relatively unknown journeymen relievers Art Ditmar and Ryne Duren to span the gap against Spahn. They did.

The Three Coffins is an excellent example of the locked-room mystery, a sub-genre in which a murderer appears to have no means of escape from a crime room. This type of mystery was introduced by Poe and perfected by Carr, its undisputed master. In fact one of the most famous essays on locked-room mysteries appears in this novel’s 17th chapter: “The Locked-Room Lecture.” The appeal of this type of mystery is the impossible nature of the crime. “The essence of the locked room formula,” claims Dove, “is paradox: the thing could not happen, but it has happened” (1986, 34).

OK – so far we have discussed Method 1 and Method 2 in the Trail Offers Business. Those are the two main methods of making money in this business.

Each one of these Methods is designed to drive traffic referrals to you so you can work with those referrals using Method 2. So let’s take a brief look at each:

I say drinking-I think two whole 6-packs were consumed. We all grew up and stopped being drinkers a long time ago. I often think I'd like to have a little sip of something in the evenings, but I can't figure out what I want. I hate to get tipsy, but I like to relax. I don't much like wine anymore, it makes me headachy. The creamy drinks like Bailey's are too fattening. I like a highball once or twice a year...brandy is just too strong, sherry is yucky, though I think it would be funny to have it as my signature drink.
Walker has updated her writing to reflect the current climate - economically, technologically and sociologically. Times are tough on the event riders circuit, with owners selling horses; people communicate with iPads, mobiles and via email; and Walker has included a storyline concerning a woman famous for being famous (someone who bears more than a passing resemblance to Katie Price). I love that Walker is embracing all these factors - it makes Kiss and Tell incredibly relatable.

We may feel protected behind our wall, but we may also feel lonely. Walls are built to keep people out. To feel less lonely, we need to make a little crawl space to let people in. We don’t have to destroy our walls in one day, but perhaps we can let at least one person in. We will learn, one person at a time, what it feels like to be less protected, and less lonely.

Speaking of gardens... with such nice weather, we've been working outside a lot, so it's easy to forget to do any prepping.

You see, this is the great thing about the friendships I have formed on the internet amongst the writing community - they are true and deep running friendships between like-minded people. And I gotta say it's just like meeting one's oldest and dearest friends when you meet in the flesh.
That, at least, is a sentiment I can stand behind and taking the plunge is something I have become a champion at. And until the day comes when I know it's right, well, I'll keep jumping with my impish self until I find a pile suitable enough to sustain a legion of notebooks. And in my last dates, I want to jump with some of those great guys with whom, in my past, I may have thought "eh, this won't work," but who deserve a second (or third, or forth look.)

“The problem is in the United States, nothing bad happens to you if you don’t know a foreign language,” but many other countries begin learning English in grade school because English is the primary international language (Day). Firefighters in Sweden have given interviews in English to reporters, native Chinese teach English in America, Spaniards have taken eight years of English by the time they get to college. In Bulgaria, students attend classes taught in German. This forces them to use a second language as they go about their studies despite the language barrier (Day). Even the absolutely useless Eastern countries are becoming fluent in our Western languages. For some reason, this has been allowed to happen, and our own students here in America cannot see how atrocious this trend has become. We need to stop this before it gets even more out of hand.

Think of it as a shorthand version, or an introduction to the Doctor.

Cheri stared at the envelope in her hand...what should she do with it? She could post it and let the naughty pictures do the job they were meant to do, but would that be the best tactic? Should she wait until the affair was at its zenith and then post the pictures? Or should she destroy them and trust that the poison barb of suspicion would solve the problem without any more direct action from her.
