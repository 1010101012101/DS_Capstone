Dear Margo: I know this sounds nuts, and it's not even my business, but a group of us was at a Sunday brunch, and there was a little girl there, I swear, who was a 6-year-old sexpot. How is this possible? She was crawling up on the lap of any man who sat down, and at one point, while just standing around, it really looked as though she was masturbating. When we all left, I mentioned this to my husband, who said perhaps she'd unfortunately seen some porn on the TV. I do not know her parents well enough to bring this up, but I think something is really wrong with this. What do you think? — Disturbed

"What it was really about was helping students understand enough about fields other than their majors, that they would be able to go out and do something working in an interdisciplinary team," Moos says. "Because in this society, that's how things get done."
It's classic Tyler, replete with references to crab feasts and Reisterstown Road, with characters who have dug themselves so deep into their emotional caves that they don't realize how small the space is, and dark, until an avalanche removes the back wall. She is, quintessentially, a domestic writer, a term that, absurdly, still implies some sort of smallness or fear of more sweeping narrative. Tyler's narratives are plenty sweeping, though not in a strutting look-at-me-ain't-I-epic way.
When J.G. Ballard died in April 2009, he left behind a body of work dominated by a few key ideas. First were the erotic possibilities of violence, as embodied by his 1973 novel "Crash." Equally important was his sense of suburban life as not just soul-dead but also dangerous — where beneath a surface layer of conformity we find ugliness and rage. It's easy, in an age of workplace violence and school shootings, to take such a vision for granted; what Ballard is reflecting back at us is the essence of ourselves. But when he first explored these concepts in the 1960s, it was a departure as radical in its way as any of that era.

"How to Disappear and Never Be Found," British playwright Fin Kennedy's compelling, darkly comedic musing on modern identity, currently at the Gerding Theater's Ellyn Bye Studio, plays out like a puzzle-piece thriller in which the hero is trying to escape not just from others but from himself. Which, Kennedy suggests, isn't as easy or as useful a trick as it might appear.

Even though Thompson believed he could still play, the realities of wanting to remain in Portland and the Timbers moving to Major League Soccer in 2011 factored into his decision.

We've been working on the (new) songs for so long, and there had been no pressure to get them out and do anything with them. But now people know about us, and everyone's expressing something. Everyone has an idea about where they want us to go. We started working on the second record as soon as we finished the first record, just so we didn't get caught in that sophomore slump. We didn't want it to feel like a chore. You can't force something like that.

Russo responds by telling McIntyre on the recording that "what goes on in Vegas, stays in Vegas" and urges the columnist to compare the Vegas downtown to Cleveland's downtown.
The sound of the Dangerous Summer is recognizable — lead singer A.J. Perdomo sings very much like Kenny Vasoli of the Starting Line, and it is safe to say that the guitarists in the group have heard a Saves the Day album or two. But after two albums and a pair of EPs it’s probably better to compare the Ellicott City, Md.-based combo to very early, non-hooky U2 and mid-’00s, non-hooky Jimmy Eat World than to any of their peers.
Doxil also is used to treat AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and multiple myeloma.
The American people have spoken with a loud, clear voice, which said to me, “Get lost.” To my staff, it sounded like “Take a long walk on a short pier.” To others, it was more like “Drop dead.” Dear friends and valued colleagues can disagree, but I believe with all my heart that I heard right.

Le Carré, whose real name is David Cornwell, did indeed work for MI5 and MI6 in the 1950s and 1960s, and his stories have always come with a ballast of realism and authenticity. His real qualities as a writer, though, lie in a gift for plot and a zest for atmosphere. When Smiley goes to Oxford to meet an old friend, researcher Connie Sachs, both scene and character leap from the page within a few sentences. "She was a big woman, bigger than Smiley by a head. A tangle of white hair framed her sprawling face. She wore a jacket like a blazer and trousers with elastic at the waist and she had a low belly like an old man's. A coke fire smoldered in the grate. Cats lay before it and a mangy grey spaniel, too fat to move, lounged on the divan. On a trolley were the tins she ate from and the bottles she drank from."

"Latina," which takes place on Wrara Plesoiu's glitzy, record-adorned set, opens with an audition. Three interchangeable, identically clad record company executives sit in the audience and give feedback to aspiring singer Hanan (Jamie Elvey). She is clearly talented, they tell her, but Will, Jill and Bill (Seth Tucker, Bonni Allen and Brian Skellenger) see a big problem ahead. She is unmarketable. Hanan is Lebanese-American, a heritage that evokes images of terrorists. The officials sign her up with a condition: She must give up her true identity, whatever that may be, and learn to pass for a Latina sexpot. Her coach will be ethnic consultant Mary O'Malley (Aditi Kapil), who herself has many secrets. Meanwhile, office manager Blanca (Hope Cervantes) has the hots for Hanan.
"We definitely were not as deep as we have been in the past; we've got to figure out a way to get some of our depth back," general manager Ken Holland told M-Live.com. "We'll explore the free agent market, we'll move in two or three kids, we'll explore trades at the draft."

This process also ensured I could represent to all Marylanders that our administration had fulfilled an important campaign pledge on a difficult issue. Our record of 249 pardons and commutations was met with neither wild cheering nor moral outrage. (I also rejected more than 200 clemency requests.) Governors are rarely thanked, but it was enormously gratifying to hear from those who received (and earned) clemency from me. Many shared their gratitude for restored rights, restored employability and restored years with their families. This sense of restoration drives the process and offsets the understandable resistance so many executives manifest toward it. Indeed, no man made process is perfect — and with this understanding comes the realization that mistakes can be made.

øThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration "and the industry both seem to agree that the primary focus should be on ensuring the safety of integrated communications technologies, and seem to assume that if it is integrated it will be safe.

Touting a similar pedigree, E. Tautz, a haberdasher founded in 1867, is also very much back in business after suffering a post-WWII decline in sales. With the spring collection, owner Patrick Grant heralds a modernized take on its sporting lineage: A tapered version of the signature look the brand was known for, using the same Melton (a heavy wool-based fabric) and soft, cavalry-issue, twill-weaved Barathea (made by the same firm that stitched them back in the 19th century).

Kujukuri Beach. The beach was chosen for the landing by the First Army because of its long, straight coastline and lack of coral reefs. Known popularly as 99 Beach for its length in ri, an old Japanese form of distance measure, the 50-mile beach was where American troops would first come ashore. A good map, but little else in English, can be found at 99beach.com/beach/index.html. The easiest rail link is from Tokyo to Kujukuri town.

Best safety tip: Test yourself before you overterrain yourself. We have some amazing expert terrain in Telluride, and we love to see people getting after it but not getting stuck or hurt.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Friday it had investigated a fire that occurred in Wisconsin this spring, after the Volt extended-range electric vehicle underwent a 20 m.p.h., side-impact test for its five-star crash safety rating. The crash punctured the Volt's lithium-ion battery pack, and after more than three weeks of sitting outside, the vehicle and several cars around it caught fire. No one was hurt.
On the Bull Mountain saga, considered by many a planning fiasco, Dirksen called its handling "clumsy" and said he sees his mistake was in waiting too long to fully lay out the plan's details for residents.

The Question: I thought the new federal law on credit card payments said companies couldn't require payments to be due on weekends or holidays and then charge a late fee if the payment wasn't made. My most recent Visa payment was due on Sept. 4 -- a Saturday. It was received by the company on Sept. 7 -- a Tuesday -- because of the Labor Day weekend. They hit me with a $35 late fee. How do I fight this?

TRUSCOTT: I think people are looking for solutions, not the typical Democrat talking points. Voters are justifiably frustrated and want to see specifics. More empty Obama promises will be met with skepticism. Republicans must make the case that their solutions are a better alternative and it's time for a change. As I've heard a wise and thoughtful man say on occasion, "If you keep doing what you've done, you're going to get what you've got." A variation of that theme in an ad will be very powerful.

If you decided to make a list of happy loving couples in American drama, chances are you wouldn't think to include George and Martha, the vicious and skillful marital warriors from "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" But there's a case to be made that Edward Albee's classic is as much love story and comedy -- however dark and lacerating it may be on both those counts -- as it is contemporary tragedy. That reportedly is the tack being taken by director David-Smith English in a Clackamas Rep production that stars an actual married couple -- Doren Elias and K.B. Mercer -- in the iconic lead roles, with Dennis Kelly and Annie Rimmer as the younger couple that strays into the line of fire.

Why else do you think black folk flinch when the mug shot goes up on television, hoping the face will not be brown -- as if we bore some communal responsibility for the suspect's misdeeds? Why else do you think so much of our music is a song of violence and crime? Why else, when I ask an auditorium full of black kids how frequently the individual who murders a white person is black, do they figure it at 75 percent? Why else are they shocked to hear it's only 13?
The funding would require an agreement with Cullinan Properties, the Streets of St. Charles developer, to apply offset funds toward the city's South Main Street project. That project, south of Interstate 70, would elevate South Main Street to meet the Streets of St. Charles development entrance.

Officials said a Jersey City man was issued three summonses this week after his vehicle collided with a police car that was responding to a call late Wednesday night, The Jersey Journal reports.
He thinks one problem with "Always Running" is that its triumph-over-adversity story line created a heroic image of him that he didn't intend. "I'm not really a big hero; I've been very lucky. I did make some choices that I think were good choices — getting out of the gang, getting out of drugs. But on the other hand I was also very fortunate. I should've been dead like my homies, but I wasn't."

Baca is not a police chief, and unlike a chief, he was elected to his position, making him a politician as well as a law enforcement officer. Nevertheless, he and his office would be better served if he were to depoliticize it as much as possible. He's done just the opposite — not just by endorsing Trutanich but also by agreeing to serve as the honorary chairman of his campaign, as well as that of Assemblyman Mike Feuer, who is running for city attorney. Baca properly apologized for breaking the law in his Trutanich appearance; he should go further and scale back his attempts to aid his political friends.

"We are beyond doing more with less," Shelby said. "We will be doing less with less. We’re making cuts at the central level that will directly affect our ability to support schools.

In an editorial accompanying the two studies, Brawley said the findings about dense breasts create "several conundrums," not least that their mammograms are difficult to interpret.

Prieto, Cuban-born, Russian-educated and, at the moment, a visiting professor at Princeton University, may be recalled for his "Nocturnal Butterflies of the Russian Empire." There, his narrator "J." was a smuggler who ran goods all over Europe -- trafficking in odd items (such as night-vision goggles) as he attempted to capture a rare butterfly for a client -- and traded letters with his girlfriend "V."

I remember as a child going to Mentor-on-the-Lake with my family and meeting my aunt, uncle and cousins who lived on Lake Shore Boulevard in MOTL, at the Mentor Marsh for a delicious fish-fry dinner. When the dinner was complete, I remember using the leftover lemons to cleanse our teeth.

The squabbling between political campaigns and the harrumphing of pundits were put in proper perspective at, of all places, the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) dinner — the annual Prom on the Potomac where 2,000 or so media members and movie stars gather to honor the president and admire one another.

So why aren't Passover desserts a bit more diverse and exciting? Part of the reason comes from the strong pull of tradition. You get used to seeing your great aunt's heavy matzo-meal sponge cake (or, even worse, a can of macaroons) on the table, and suddenly the holiday doesn't feel complete without them. But there is a whole world of desserts that are light, elegant and lovely -- and kosher for Passover.

A: Hyundai's culture is something refreshing. This idea that bold targets drive great things. (It) just stretches your boundaries, your mind and your team in ways that you wouldn't otherwise have stretched and achieved.

Oracle sought millions of dollars in damages after claiming that Google Inc. built its popular Android mobile software by stealing some of the technology from Java, a programming platform that Oracle Corp. bought two years ago.
Manning has had a few of those: the rushing touchdown he had in the monsoon-like conditions in the win over the Dolphins in London; that horrid, four-interception game against the Vikings, the four-touchdown performance in the Super Bowl preview game against the Patriots on the final week of the regular season.
For that, the other investment banks could thank JPMorgan, America's biggest bank. The stock plunged 9.3 percent, dragging other banks with big Wall Street operations down with it. Morgan Stanley fell 4.2 percent and Goldman Sachs fell 3.9 percent. Citigroup fell 4.2 percent.

The Fixer loves to fix consumer problems. Sadly, we can't tackle drunken drivers, abandoned buildings, parking tickets, nasty neighbors, bad grades, deadbeat dads or missing birth moms within the scope of this column.

"A lot of people still like the (incandescent lights), but that's because of the cost," Pearson said, pointing out that the incandescent bulbs are slightly cheaper than their LED counterparts. Typically, a strand of 25 large-bulb LED lights sells for about $10. A longer strand of the old style costs a few dollars less. LED and incandescent bulbs are not interchangeable.
"The Five-Year Engagement" is so scattered and overlong, it really feels like it lasts five years, and even the inherent likability of stars Jason Segel and Emily Blunt can't overcome the film's pervasive sense of strain. It becomes so tortured, it almost gets to the point where you hope these two will break up for good, just because it's the pragmatic thing to do and because it would finally wrap things up.
The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash.
I come down on the latter side, though I found myself in the curious position of arguing that this geekboy fantasy fest was, in fact, quite feminist with EW’s own Doc Jensen, who thought the pilot was misogynistic. Granted, I have the context of having read the entire book on which the first season is based, and having watched the first six episodes.

Saltzman questioned why the chief would cut domestic violence and child abuse investigators -- ranked among the top 10 policing services important to the community by the bureau's budget advisory group -- and not touch other units, like mounted patrol's nine officers (ranked 13 by the advisory group) or cold case homicide.
Most Easter-y of all are the pygmy rabbits, tiny bunnies native to the U.S. that weigh less than 1 pound and live in sagebrush territory in the American West. They are believed to be the smallest rabbits in the world. More and more, the pine-juniper woodlands have encroached on the sage, or their habitats have been destroyed by development. Several populations, such as the Columbia Basin pygmy, almost went extinct and were saved by zoo breeding programs. Great burrowers, pygmy rabbits also rely on winter cover by digging tunnels through the snow to escape predators, but lesser snowfall is leaving them exposed.
Officials have one overriding goal: Improving the economies of scale so they can cover their cities with lower administrative costs and sometimes fewer firefighters.
There is no pinching pennies when it comes to ordering from the regular and "feature" menus. Portions nonetheless are very large and often imaginative. Executive chef Zach Ladner scatters candied pumpkin seeds across spiced buttermilk cream, for instance, that sits atop delicious butternut-squash-and-pumpkin bisque. He gilds the lily again by contrasting a cloud of the creamy, fresh cow cheese called burrata with a dollop of sweet tomato jam, decorating the shebang with thin slices of tomatoes and good olive oil. Brilliant!
But when the hometown Detroit Lions called the first week of April to bring him in for a visit, Long made the most of it.
For years her music -- powered by a big, soulful voice -- had been overshadowed by drug- and alcohol-fueled behavior. It was as if her name had officially been changed to Troubled Singer Amy Winehouse. Or perhaps she had taken the middle name Meltdown. The autopsy results will come later, but it's hard to imagine anything other than intoxicants turned toxic.

As some of the water vaporizes, the engine metal loses heat in a process called evaporative cooling, like sweat cooling the skin. Eventually the metal's temperature drops to the freezing point and ice accumulates. When ice shards slough off, they can choke airflow into the compressor, causing the engine to surge or stall. They also may quench the engine's combustor, causing a flameout, or complete failure. Vibration and mechanical damage may occur if breakaway ice fragments slam into the engine's rapidly spinning blades.

To Mara, Kraft’s balance of personal and professional obligations was “amazing.” He called Kraft as good a businessman as any owner in the league, and said the Giants are simply trying to match the Patriots’ level of success.
The Giants said their talks with Cain's representatives were professional and constant in hopes of coming to an agreement before San Francisco open the season Friday at Arizona. Sabean said the contract length and dollar figures were decided over the previous three days.
But in the second period, Winnipeg's Blake Wheeler put on a show, scoring twice to pull the Jets into the game. Wheeler's 12th and 13th goals of the season came on rebounds after Halak made the initial save.

"Greece wants Macedonia to change its identity. It wants it to change its passports and change its constitution. It's too much to be asked -- one country dictating to another country what its name should be," Koloski said.
Dead icons also can create enormous buzz. Earlier this year, a digital version of the late-musician Tupac Shakur appeared on stage during a music festival with Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre. An Internet video of the show became an instant phenomenon.

He was such a regular at the Hawk 'n' Dove, the manager Paul Meagher put a Widmer ale on tap for Wu when the Oregon Ducks played the Auburn Tigers at the BCS National Championship in January.
At the very least, the franchise tag would buy the Ravens some more time to work out an extension with Rice before the start of the 2012 season. Even if he is tagged, the Ravens would still have until July 16 to agree on an extension before Rice's salary is set for the 2012 season.

The conflict between Kucinich and Kaptur over the rail and immigration issues came to the fore at a Wednesday night candidates forum sponsored by the Coalition for Hispanic/Latino Issues and Progress in Lorain.
We know that for centuries the Church has been metaphorically compared with a boat or a ship. But, as a friend of mine says, "A ship in harbor is safe - but that is not what ships are built for." Many of us in parish ministry, whether clergy or lay people, spend a lot of time trying to figure out if our vessels are seaworthy. Will our budget get us through the next year? Is our message relevant? Do we have a strategic plan in place? Should we advertise on the Internet or in the phone book?
For them and their staff, the new school is a godsend. For six years, Synergy has rented space from St. Patrick's Catholic Church, near the intersection of Central Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard. Not only is the building cramped and outdated -- one room does multiple duty as a library, computer lab, teachers' lounge and main office -- but Synergy teachers have to pack up their classrooms every Friday to make room for the church's Sunday school.

The Red Wings pulled goalie Jimmy Howard to add an extra skater with 1:31 left, but put him back in the net because Henrik Zetterberg was called for high-sticking with 55.8 seconds left. David Legwand's power-play goal, with 39 seconds left, sealed the win.
Jan. 9, 2007, No. 3 Wisconsin 72, No. 5 Ohio State 69: The Badgers nearly blow a 10-point lead in the final minute, as the Buckeyes' Jamar Butler misses a 3-pointer at the buzzer that would have forced overtime. It is the only conference loss of the season for the Buckeyes, who go on a 22-game winning streak after the loss.
Brian Dickerson says that a tax scofflaw is better than no neighbor at all ("Wayne's bitter antidote for abandonment," Feb. 9). As a resident of a Detroit neighborhood that has plenty of tax-foreclosed properties and vacant houses, I heartily concur with his position that an occupied house is better than a vacant one. I further support Wayne County's decision to offer some homeowners the chance to buy back their homes for as little as $500 and the promise to stay current on their property taxes going forward.
I love talking to the guys about showering coverage. How do you get the right width, the right depth, the right dimension, the right temperature. I'll send them an e-mail, "Hey I tried this shower head at this hotel and I liked it. Let's get a sample."
So Des McAnuff's first season as artistic director outright -- after an unstable power-sharing arrangement last year -- offers evidence that he's determined to bring standards for the big, money-making musicals up to snuff with the Shakespeare. Call it calculating if you like, but at $100-plus a ticket, I call it tough love.
There was no disagreement Tuesday morning among Alameda County supervisors about whether to formally accept the resignation of Nadia Lockyer, who won the District 2 seat in 2010.

"All of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it," he said at a Stanford University commencement address in 2005. "I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out."
As I sat on a bench in this tranquil oasis in the center of the city, I read some notes I'd made while studying the Cosmati floor. It's the only one in the world with an inscription; some of the brass letters have disappeared over the centuries, but the sense is known. First is a date and the name of the artist, then a complicated formula for calculating the end of the world. "A hedge (lives for) three years, add dogs and horses and men, stags and ravens, eagles, enormous whales: each one following triples the years of the one before."
Rudolph always has been an overachiever, but not necessarily in a positive way. "A counselor told me that he had never seen someone progress into alcoholism faster than I did," he said. "To show you how twisted I was, I wore that as a badge of honor."
It would be wonderful — weird and highly ironic, too — if the increased use of the B-word on network TV was proof that women were finally becoming a real voice in the industry. Alas, the numbers do not bear that out. The vast majority of writers, directors and television executives — in other words, those writing and approving the use of the word — are still men.

It's easily the toughest stretch of the season and one that should make for both an exciting and daunting stretch run.
He could very easily be a friendly guy whom you're unfairly judging on your own friendliness scale. He could also be flirting with other women as a prelude to cheating, or in open defiance of you, or doing something else at some other point along the indecency scale. I don't think it's fair for me to choose either side without context.
"That's a compliment to their defense and the way that they play," Matheny said of the Raiders, who held the Angels to 27 points below their scoring average. "They're the best ballclub that we've played against."
Cuyahoga County's first executive made plenty of other promises, too, to distinguish himself from old guard Democrats and a massive county corruption investigation.
