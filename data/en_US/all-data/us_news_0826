Fuller acknowledges punching Lana Rosas in the face during their February 2011 confrontation in downtown Manhattan. She was knocked off her feet and hit her head on the ground.
Albert Pujols took the first-round game against outfielder Matt Holliday with 60 percent of the vote. It was, of course, the closest of the 1/16 duels in the Cardinals All-Time Tournament.

As a member of the cohort who filled those coffers beyond the trustees’ dreams, I don’t want to hear about sacrificing my benefit. Congress can’t want these tens of millions of people to be livid with them. Congress must create an appropriate tax policy, bring in the funds needed and pay up.

"You always want to make sure that everybody disconnects their hoses," said Jeff Schmitz, manager at Cotton's Ace Hardware in Columbia. If not, outdoor spigots will freeze and possibly pipes burst.
"All of the student athletes who earned the Dorsey scholarship met or exceeded the program’s criteria. They did absolutely nothing wrong; in fact, they are amazing students.

The United Arab Emirates last week called for a sweeping ban on BlackBerry e-mail, messaging and Web services, saying the devices "allow users to act without any legal accountability, causing judicial, social and national security concerns." It plans to shut off the services in October unless it works out a compromise with RIM.
Fielder did not sign this many when he was a Brewer.
But let's return to that e-mail above, regarding this first of two scheduled furlough days in Jeffco schools this year. State government and the city of Denver, faced with revenue shortfalls, have also furloughed their employees. The rationalization for this practice is that workers should be given days off to make up for the pay cut. Now, it's unfortunate that there's not enough money in the public till to pay these government workers what they were expecting, but why give them the day off?
At least two people who were involved in the rescue from a village near Linyi in Shandong province have been arrested, and family members who were involved in a brawl with local authorities after Chen's escape have been arrested.
Nordin, now 60 and retired, can tell you a few other things about Crockett - which, with its town meetings, low crime rate and annual community events, retains the feel of small-town America during the 1950s. It also happens to be, say local real estate agents, one of the only places in the Bay Area where it's possible to buy a home with a view of the water for less than $200,000.
Pyeongchang, South Korea, won the 2018 Winter Olympics on Wednesday despite the Demilitarized Zone running through Gangwon Province. . . .
Here, he’s Joseph, the violent drunk, and he never lets go of the screen, or your gaze. It’s in small details, like the way he walks into a room, his hands already in fists. It’s in that gaze, which is as piercing and impenetrable as flint.

"If Temple is going with four guards, we're going to make them go out of those four guards," Conklin said. "We're going to have two bigs and we're going to pound them offensively. We're confident enough in our defense this year where if you play four guards, we can contain the dribble drive, guard the 3-pointer, still take charges, rebound and get out in transition."
"If there are ways within the rules to get with some of the receivers, I'd like to get with Austin (Collie) or Reggie Wayne, start throwing with them and building up that rapport.

Call them serious, sassy — and saucy.
But from interviews with lawmakers and other Trenton politicians, a picture emerges of a weeklong political theater at its pinnacle. There was stagecraft on both sides, the various sources said, and some strategic serious mistakes by the Democrats who continue to underestimate the governor. It appeared Democrats, these sources say, had a plan: Blast Christie for every cut and claim victory for everything that he left in place. They thought they had him in a box.
Woods closed ground on the par-5s Friday, making birdies on three of the four long holes.
"It's very early in the process. This is just an offer," he said Wednesday. "But this is a legitimate development team. They've got experience in taking old properties and finding new uses for them. And the potential users are legitimate, too. They are companies that are trying to expand."
The book begins with a poem, in which Billy announces:
But she also had her best performances in the games that mattered most. She one-hit Phoenix Pinnacle in a 5A-II tournament second round game while hitting a home run, the lone run of the game. She struck out at least 14 batters in each of Deer Valley's last eight games of the season. And, of course, she had that masterpiece in the 5A-II title game, hitting the eventual game-winning home run despite Tucson Ironwood Ridge trying to walk her intentionally and then striking out the side with a one-run lead to end the game.

"He had 12 outs via the ground ball or strikeout, so that's obviously a really good sign," Yanks manager Joe Girardi said. "He has the sinking fastball and the cutter and any time you can get guys to hit the ball on the ground you've got a pretty good chance of getting outs."
"I went out there and pitched how I would normally pitch, just reacting to hitters and what's working for me," Fister said. "I got my work in with my fastball, but also got the off-speed work in, too."
Dick Schouten has been an excellent steward and advocate for Washington County, its infrastructure, and its vulnerable citizens.

Still, 16 runs allowed by Ross over his past 7 1/3 innings won't go far in nailing down a permanent roster spot. There might be a bit of a caveat this time: The right-hander was facing a team with a major-league-best record of 19-8. The Rays have won six in a row and 12 of 13, and they're 13-1 at home.
Federal prosecutors filed actions to seize the two properties -- in adjacent suites at 7586 Redwood Blvd. -- in U.S. District Court in San Francisco on Monday.

Wood made the comments in an interview following a press conference for an exhibition, "Faces, Time and Places," which features his own paintings. It includes likenesses of him and his band mates, as well as Muhammad Ali and Al Pacino.
The implication is that if Spitzer had conformed his public performance as a prosecutor to his private peccadilloes, his critics would have been deprived of their most lethal argument -- that he was a "whited sepulcher ... full of all uncleanness." That is the picturesque accusation leveled by Jesus against the scribes and Pharisees, and by my mother against a supposedly philandering priest who had lectured her in the confessional about losing patience with her six children.

They went with several different combinations, to make up for the loss of Miller, and every coaching move seemed to work. We saw Patty Mills play the game of his young NBA career, and also saw Brandon Roy, Nicolas Batum, and Rudy Fernandez all take turns initiating the offnese. We also saw incredibly-clutch free-throw shooting, as the Blazers went 32 fo 33 at the line, includuing 17 of 17 in the fourth quarter, and made their final 24 free throws of the game to preserve the win.
PG&E wants customers to pay almost 90 percent of the cost, adding nearly $2 to a typical customer's monthly bill by 2014. The Division of Ratepayer Advocates said changes to the plan could lower the price tag to $621 million, and contended that shareholders should foot the entire bill.
Any level above 50 – which production facilities have managed to maintain for more than two and a half years – represents growth. Fifteen of the 18 industries in the survey, including apparel, machinery and transportation equipment, reported overall expansion.
However, I doubt that will be an issue for Ohio State with this class, which currently has 17 pledges and likely five or six spots remaining. Jim Tressel typically has a couple scholarships to hand to fourth- and fifth-year walk-ons each fall, and he seldom hits the 25-player limit on a class, so I doubt grayshirting will come into play.

A scene from the Oscar-winning "Out of Africa" popped up on screen featuring Meryl Streep walking next to Robert Redford.
China's vast export sector has been battered on multiple fronts of late. The growth in demand from foreign customers is slowing.

Both times I left the Springfield-bound group, I traveled out of Little Village past Cook County Jail. I was reminded of the young teens I met at the jail while working on an earlier column.

The late U.S. Rep. Mel Hancock, R-Springfield, who, before his election to Congress, led the tax-limiting effort, had been worried about the tax vs. fee problem. The state Supreme Court has been called upon time and again to clarify matters. In a 1991 case, the high court created five "when a fee is a fee" criteria; Judge Dildine ruled the stormwater user charge flunked all of them.

Here's my dilemma over Carolyn Chute's new book. For starters, it's too long, it's top-heavy with characters, and it dangles more loose ends than the unraveling sweater of one of her hardscrabble rebels.

And it isn't just in some theoretical future that the wars will affect the nation's economy: They already have. The conditions that precipitated the financial crisis in 2008 were shaped in part by the war on terror. The invasion of Iraq and the resulting instability in the Persian Gulf were among the factors that pushed oil prices up from about $30 a barrel in 2003 to historic highs five years later, peaking at $140 a barrel in current dollars in 2008. Higher oil prices threatened to depress U.S. economic activity, prompting the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and loosen regulations. These policies were major contributors to the housing bubble and the financial collapse that followed.

It's just as accurately described as a bunch of British guys sitting around acting. But what actors! The cast includes Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, John Hurt, Mark Strong,Ciar�n Hinds and Toby Jones. The tale is intricate and sometimes hard to follow, the action slow to non-existent. And it doesn't hurt the movie one bit. These guys make proper English diction as compelling as a gunfight, and "Tinker Tailor" as satisfying as any shoot-'em-up using real bullets instead of words to get its point across.

Linda Wilson: A traffic analysis was done to look at potential improvements to I-270. I'm not sure exactly what you are looking for, but it was given a thorough review by our engineers. We are adding a lane of capacity so drivers can expect traffic to flow better than it does now. I would not expect it to be free flow 60+ mph at rush hour, but it should be better than the stand still it is today. You are right there is a bigger issue of needing more north-south options.

But the market for higher-end domestic bubbly is maturing. Roederer and Carneros devote much of their energy to their top cuvees, L'Ermitage and Le Reve, which retail for more than $40. While Mumm and Chandon are clearly more focused on their basic wines, they are becoming more vocal about their high-end wines. Chandon's Etoile, for instance, was relaunched this year with a crown cap instead of a cork, though it is still the only top-end cuvee that isn't vintage-dated. Mumm recently released a special batch of its DVX wine made in collaboration with Carlos Santana.

The case: After writing a bad check for $83.41, Kristy Schwarm began receiving letters purporting to be from the Mendocino County district attorney informing her she was under criminal investigation. The mother of six "was terrified," court records state. In reality, the threatening letters had been sent by a debt company based in Fair Oaks called District Attorney Technical Services, which had contracts with Mendocino County and two dozen other DA offices to pursue bad-check writers.

The megabout everyone wants to see — and has, for at least the last several years — would pair the two men almost everyone considers to be the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world, Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao. But the squabbling camps can’t seem to agree on much of anything, with disputes arising over how the potential $100 million in revenue would be split and drug-testing would be administered. Meanwhile, time goes by and the window of opportunity for making the match shuts a little bit every month. Mayweather is 35 and Pacquiao 33, and each might find they are on the downhill side of exemplary careers if a contractual agreement to settle the question as to who is really No. 1 is not reached soon.

There is a chance JetBlue may repeat the offer, though the airline says it won't decide until sometime in the spring.

The radiation from cell phones is too weak to unravel your DNA the way a massive dose of X-rays or exposure to nuclear waste could. But hold your phone to your ear for 800 minutes a month -- as most Americans do -- and the rays penetrate 2 inches or more into your skull, where they may heat up brain tissue. If you carry your phone on your belt, radiation may penetrate bone marrow cells in your hip -- a place where stem cells are produced -- and unleash cell-damaging free radicals or cause other trouble.

Jones and CIA Director Leon Panetta to Pakistan to confront officials there with the need to do more to end their government's links to terror and to deal with " Mullah Omar's Quetta Shura and the Haqqani network, the two leading Taliban groups killing U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan."

The fish course included halibut slowly poached sous vide style, topped with shavings of bonito and served on a mat of rapini in a white miso broth perfumed with ginger and radishes. There's no mistaking the French gestalt, but the Asian touches add surprise and subtlety. In fact, at times the flavors are almost too subdued; when the portions are small, the intensity can be ramped up.
Morgan branded Liebich's exoneration of the Foundation Testing Branch - based largely on Morgan's own cursory analysis - "a well-crafted misrepresentation" with conclusions "unsupported by the facts."
It would have been five, but freshman tailback Malcolm Agnew had a fourth-quarter fumble and freshman placekicker Trevor Romaine missed a 27-yard field goal with no time left that would have given OSU a 24-21 victory.

When Hollywood writers began a strike a little more than a year ago, movie and TV stars went out of their way to show solidarity with the mostly unheralded scribes who craft their lines.

Dozens of actors shot brief but stylish black-and-white Internet films supporting the scriptwriters.

Susan Reimer's moral indignation regarding the dearth of women's responses to the political furor over birth control is misplaced ("In birth control debate, where are the women's voices?" Feb. 16).

You may never look at hamburgers the same way again.

Some experts say any flaws in PG&E policies that come to light should help better understand what happened in San Bruno - where the company laid down pipe in the 1950s with a poorly constructed weld, never pressure-tested it, and when it exploded, dispatched an untrained worker to try to turn off the pipe's manual valves. The fire burned for nearly 90 minutes before properly trained and equipped workers shut off the gas.

"This is about who makes the determination," Blashfield told the Free Press editorial page Monday. "All we're doing is ensuring that it's not just one guy, such as a disgruntled governor who moves forward on an executive order.

"Without releases, Minnesota is susceptible to lawsuits challenging the adequacy of the treatment program," Nobles found.

Even had it succeeded, the supercommittee would have failed. Ultimately, the only way to control federal spending and deficits is to suppress the upward spiral of health costs. These are already the budget's largest single expense (27 percent in 2010 compared with 20 percent for defense), and their continued rapid growth, combined with the scheduled introduction of Obamacare, will soon bring them to nearly one-third. The supercommittee didn't have the time or staff to solve a problem as contentious and complex as health care.
