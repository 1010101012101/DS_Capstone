Anyway, I am really looking forward to getting on with my Lone Star quilt, now I know where I'm going with it. Perhaps I should have brought it all with me? Instead I have brought a quilt with me to sew down the binding, so I'll get on with that soon.
I did gardening on Saturday, and here it is Wednesday, and I'm just barely scraping by... and I haven't had a day yet when I haven't fully fallen to sleep ... narcoleptic style... while "watching" my kids. I hate that. I mean, if they were napping too, then fine. But to fall asleep with no warning, in the middle of the day, while your kids are awake... not going to win "mother of the year" any time soon.

There have been several things going on around here though. For those of you who are friends with me on Facebook (and I show up in your News Feed), you are more up to speed. But, then again I don't put everything on Facebook, so here's a little rundown...
Fifteen years later — yup that’s right (cue feeling old) — I see the movie again in the movie theatre, but this time in IMAX 3D. My friends and I did not go to this specific show because it was IMAX (0r 3D for that matter… I’m pretty indifferent towards it) but because the time worked the best for everyone.
This may be due to the fact that with the advancement of technology, immediate viewing of past seasons of shows is available. This makes the cliff hangers and hooks not nearly as effective due to the fact that you can just simply hit next to see what happens next instead of waiting anywhere from a week to a full year for the season to resume. Technology such as netflix and hulu have definitely curbed the excitement of previously aired shows that are now available without the designated delays. This could be the source of my frustration and if that is the case then maybe I should implement another show into my cue so that I can actually enjoy Prison Break. However, I am still curious if I would be this frustrated if I was viewing the show at the time it was being aired.
So here’s the problem with the “it was just domestic violence” mentality: batterers can be incredibly lethal, deranged and a very real threat to the entire community. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for people to perceive abusers as big dumb brutes – a stereotype perpetuated by misconceptions and the occasional life-time movie. But of all the criminals to minimize the potential danger they could pose to society, batterers who would kill their partners or family members should not be considered a low risk group. To the contrary, their manipulative, often calculated, and frequently lethal behavior should be considered among the most dangerous of criminals to the victims they target as well as the community they inhabit.
There is Yeda anna – probably the most colorful one in the group, whose life revolves around – “The humble vada pav”. He has drawn maps for people asking for directions , with waypoints as vada pav stalls. A connoisseur of this maharashtrian snack, Anna, even coaxes chefs who don’t have the vada pav in their menu to make it specially for him..
Suddenly the radio crackles to life. “There is a road block ahead manned by armed folks with mostly lever and bolt action deer rifles. They are blocking the roadway in front of some businesses on the left. Looks like a Chinese restaurant called Chiang’s Gourmet. Roadway is blocked with a couple of cargo containers several over turned cars and at least two Metro buses. The Metro buses are the gates, both of which external surfaces have been wrapped in industrial fencing, and enough razor wire to make Ho Chi Minh proud. The barricade is dual ringed with the cars and the cargo containers serving the outer ring, while most of the barricade interior ring is scavenged commercial fencing haphazardly welded and chained together topped with lots of rusty razor wire. The car’s width no man’s land between the two rings is liberally forested with spikey, often serrated metal punji sticks made of metal fence posts, and lots more razor wire weaved through the punji sticks.”

My husband got these beers in a multipack that had a ton of yeast sediment in the bottom of them. My old sourdough starter had frozen in the back of our refrigerator, and it was time to make some new anyways. I got a clean mason jar, some fresh flour and some clean water, in addition to rinsing the sediment from the bottom of one beer bottle. Then I left this concoction on the counter, covered with wax paper for a few days, adding about 1/4 cup of water and flour each day. Finally, I had this beautiful bubbly brew:
Now I admit that a moment ago, I have no idea who this guy is nor do I have any clue how authentic the statements above were especially about the confession but if this is the guy that did Phantom and Blassreiter, is it safe to assume that Madoka will have a satisfying tragic end?

Curiosity is another powerful emotion which can be developed and enhanced through the enjoyment of illustrations and picture books. It’s a driving force which helps children explore their environments and develops relationships. Curiosity helps our children find interest in new information and helps children begin to think more deeply about their world. A beautifully illustrated picture book about a far away land full of mystical creatures and characters is a fantastic starting point for introducing children to the fun they can find in fiction and may also spur them on to find out more and read more about different magical lands.

It’s ridiculous to invoke Hitler’s eugenics to cast aspersions on scientific analysis of religious experiences. First of all, there are serious arguments about how much of Nazi eugenics was really drawn from contemporary genetics—as opposed to the “selective breeding” that had been practiced for centuries without any knowledge of genetics beyond “like begets like”. Further, even if the Nazis had drawn on genetics when extirpating mental defectives, Jews, and gypsies, how is that an indictment of science itself? And the Nazis could fabricate plenty of other excuses to exterminate Jews.

As I write, a team of sharpshooters in the employ of the National Park Service and the Nature Conservancy is at work killing thousands of feral pigs on Santa Cruz Island, eighteen miles off the coast of Southern California. The slaughter is part of an ambitious plan to restore the island’s habitat and save the island fox, an endangered species found on a handful of Southern California islands and nowhere else. To save the fox the Park Service and Nature Conservancy must first undo a complicated chain of ecological changes wrought by humans beginning more than a century ago. (324)
It seems like they’re making a habit out of using Ms. Martian’s psychic link to keep in contact with each other which, while a smart move, could be crazy hard to write for if the writers aren’t careful enough. Still, looks like that’s yet to be a problem… though I will say that it must be awkward being a passerby and seeing the lot of them just staring at each other while they converse in their heads. How does that work, anyway? Does Megan link everyone’s outer-most layer of thoughts so as to not mix up communications with Robin checking out Zatanna? What about in the case of heated arguments? Does she have to try harder to keep guys like Superboy and Red Arrow from mind-screaming profanities at each other? For my sake, I hope they don’t delve into any of these technicalities.
We don’t like suffering, much less longsuffering, but longsuffering is a Godly habit. It is vital (paradoxical, but vital) to get into the true depths and richness of marital love.
There are twenty stories in this collection - true stories of lost friendship - and I enjoyed most of them. My favorites are the opening story, Katie Roiphe's "Torch Song," Mary Morris' "The Other Face," and Beverly Gologorsky's "In a Whirlwind." The first is about Katie as a college student, who carelessly sleeps with her friend's crush. Katie didn't even like the boy, and hardly found him attractive. Even today, she can't say why she did it, except to remark, "I was fulfilling some misplaced idea of myself. I was finally someone who took things lightly." The second is about Mary, her life long family friend Lauren, and the perils of borrowing money from a friend. The third touched me mostly because Beverly and Jessica came of age in such a different era - the late sixties and early seventies. They were both involved in various protests and civil rights movements, and fell out during a disagreement over whether men should be able to walk in a march for women's rights. Their friendship was lost over ideological conviction. Damn.

This is a bright day for indie publishing. In the old world, traditional publishers were the arbiters of literary merit. Today, thanks to the rise of indie ebooks, the world is moving toward a broader, more inclusive definition of literary merit. Smashwords gives writers the power and freedom to publish. Merit is decided by your readers. Just as it should be.

I struggled through the process of trying to figure out what God was doing...of trying to put him in a box that made sense to me. He was gracious and merciful, but he never stopped working to get his point across. I've struggled with a heavy heart, and faced the fact that my heart had been disobedient toward my God. And my faith...my faith was weak. Yesterday I changed my generic prayer that God "brings Cora home soon" to the very specific "please let us get our LOA this month." I have to admit it's not the bravest step of faith I've ever taken. And when I shared my prayer request with the kids during our Family Worship time last night, I second guessed myself. Last time I did that was in 2009 when I trusted God to bring Cora into our family. And when we weren't matched with Cora and they still believed that God was going to answer our prayer that Cora become their little sister, it broke me. Even after Caden came home, they still talked about "when Cora comes home" and I just couldn't take it. I sounded like a broken record telling them, "We don't know what God has planned for our family, it may be something else." because I didn't know how to tell them to stop expecting that prayer to be answered. I closed off my faith walk so that my kids couldn't "see" it...but yesterday I read an article about living out our faith in front of our children that made me step out and ask for something "publicly" again. While I feared for the second time that God might not give us Cora, our kids treated finding her file like it was old news. In fact, when I told the kids that Daddy and I had sent a letter to China asking if we could adopt Cora, Eli's response was "Finally." They never stopped trusting. And I wanted to shield them from disappointment if our LOA doesn't come in the timeframe we're asking for. But last night we ALL starting praying for an April LOA...for the right, God-centered reason. Even so, I was still struggling with the fact that we were even asking.

Temple has tried to summarize the Pistols on film before, but like the band members themselves, he found himself swayed and misled by McLaren. His 1980 The Great Rock 'N' Roll Swindle is a bizarre mockumentary, started in the aftermath of the group's final concert in January 1978 but before it all truly collapsed. Yet the movie clearly bears McLaren's stamp of approval and manipulative hand, and it's notably today mainly for the brazen, self-serving myths conjured by McLaren. The Filth and the Fury seeks to rectify that shambles of a film by presenting the band's side (including Lydon's and Matlock's, both of whom were omitted from Temple's first go-around with the punks). Curiously, Temple frames their talking heads in shadow, masking their faces as they come clean about their brief time together. They look as if they're in witness protection, hiding from what they wrought.

She is one of those people… She’s kind of soft-spoken, so she gets underestimated a lot, but I know her strengths way overcome that. Like I said, she is extremely dedicated, and she is honest. If she says she’s going to do something, she will find a way to get it done. We went to the park yesterday, and she just knew to stand out of the way while I took pictures of random squirrels and oddly shaped trees, and she laughed along with me while I yelled at the runners who were yelling back and forth at each other. She loves laughing, and she doesn’t care if you laugh at her laugh; she’ll actually laugh right back at yours. She always knows the perfect verses to help you in your situation, and she will never hesitate to pray for someone.

Baby Bee and I have had a wonderful time nursing so far. Right off the bat he was an excellent nurser, which was awesome. With my firstborn there was a bit more of a learning curve, and a bit more soreness. One thing that has been the same with both boys, however, is my intense hunger when I'm breastfeeding! If I go too long without food, it is not pretty. In the first weeks of breastfeeding, I am hungrier than when I am pregnant. So it's important to have a lot of healthy, easy to grab snacks around so I don't eat a bunch of junk or starve to death.

We approached our last house high up on the hill, the place of Joseph the farmer. For him we had chosen a special carol. which was about the other Joseph, so that we always felt that singing it added a spicy cheek to the night. The last stretch of country to reach his farm was perhaps the most difficult of all. In these rough bare lanes, open to all winds, sheep were buried and wagons lost. Huddled together, we tramped in one another’s footsteps, powdered snow blew into our screwed-up eyes, the candles burnt low, some blew out altogether, and we talked loudly above the gale.
As always, the meal that followed was quite memorable as a dozen bottles of champagne miraculously appeared on the table to celebrate someone's special bithday.

I tried to think of a really good wish, but the shooting star had surprised me and I didn't really have any good wishes on deck, so I wished for the first semi-intelligible thing that came to mind: for the rest of my life to be totally awesome.

So, my new resolve to run actually started before I penned this blog, near the end of November, but it wasn't until January that I started to take it seriously. Our training strategy was to be able to run 10 minutes straight with one-minute rest (walking) periods. Luckily, we are well-matched in terms of pace, so we were able to begin at four minute intervals, followed by five and then six. We are allowed to move on once we achieve a minimum of six repetitions of the interval. I thought that the five-minute intervals would be the death of our running careers, but, luckily we have made it through to six minutes. Aside from the occasional trumpeting coming out of my backside, my IBS has not been too bad. We have had times when I was required to do longer walking intervals in order to ward off bathroom sessions, but, no real emergency situations occurred until last week. During our last run I had to abandon ship after only two and a half sets of six minutes. I did not feel that our friendship was strong enough for me to soil myself in front of him. I was extremely frustrated and disappointed as we felt ready to tackle the six-minute interval hurdle, but, that was not to be. It was a miracle that I made it to the washroom in time.

This transcript is damning not merely because Cardinal Brady was given the names and addresses of other victims which he apparently decided not to pursue, but because the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland clearly sought to intimidate, humiliate and bully young and vulnerable teenagers who had already endured months and years of torture and rape. That Cardinal Brady was party to an inquisition which sought to impugn the victims’ motives and probe deeply into their sexual identity in order to deflect blame from the abuser offends every notion of justice and appals every sense of compassion. The Cardinal was not concerned with pastoral care: he was party to a process of psychological and emotional abuse after the victims had endured the trauma of physical and sexual abuse. One needs no ‘guidelines’ to deal with this: if the shepherd should care for his sheep, he should care all the more for his lambs.
When we returned at 6:35, the pub was open and there were about a dozen people in line. Sally went in to grab a seat and I went to grab a couple beers. They had one guy manning the taps and between the time it took him to go into the "kitchen" and microwave pizzas and verrrrrry sllllloooowwwly pull pints, it was literally twenty minutes before I got my beer. Singular. It turns out they can only serve one beer per ID-bearing person, by decree of the OLCC. (This is probably because of the hinky set-up, where the pub and theater are not one--so you don't get carded walking into the establishment, as you do at the Mission. But of course, you lose a decent seat if everyone in your party wants a beer. Pick your poison.) By the time I was headed into the theater, there were thirty people in a line that snaked through the pub--god knows when they got their beer.

His films are what defined my year of movie watching more than any others. Though regretfully, I did miss a few.
Later this week, I will meet a small group that has been selected to review our management systems. It is a group that will meet to discuss the future we want to create. I hope to achieve a collective outcome with this group and my board by Saturday at 5 pm. Is that too ambitious? It can’t just be about solving problems – it must be a conversation about our future. The very freedom that I feel in my own responsibility was born from the idea that I had a hand in creating this organization. We have invited people of different backgrounds that will provide insight and collective wisdom from their own individual experience to help us navigate a future. With all these different viewpoints combined with my board, we will begin the type of learning that helped to found my non-profit 18 years ago. Not to sound cliché, but it truly is an organic experience. I have concluded that what does work here is the ambiguity that exists. Anything that comes with directions or spells out our direction tends to not work.
The Christian call to evangelism is a call not simply to persuade people to make decisions but rather to proclaim to them the Good News of salvation in Christ, to call them to repentance, and to give God the glory for regeneration and conversion. We don’t fail in our evangelism if we faithfully present the Gospel and yet the person is not converted; we fail only if we don’t faithfully present the Gospel at all. (137)

Someone once asked, “What does it mean?”
my aim was to show only her expressions with the balloons around…. and leave everything else….. for that, I chose the Sigma 150mm macro, one of the sharpest lenses I have, and placed a Simpex 120cm x 50cm softbox on Elinchrom Ranger unit…. I was shooting at f11 to give enough depth to the image and to make sure that I don’t miss focus with all that balloon around…. and I also switched to manual focus… Lamisa was playing with the balloons, so the balloons were anything but stable…. for a big portion of the time, the balloons were between her and the light, putting her in shadows…… and she was also preferring to hide behind the balloons most of the time!….. so, I had to look for the slightest of opportunities to shoot between the balloons…. the Elinchrom Ranger provided the fast recycle I needed…. a speedlite would probably not have done the job; definitely not at f11….. the 120cm x 50cm softbox helped me to control the exposure on the subject as well as on the backdrop….

The SUPER skincare line was created by Dr. Nicholas Perricone. Perricone's research revealed the numerous positive benefits that particular fruits and vegetables have on the skin. Scientists were then able to create a process by which they extract the phytonutrients and include them in cleansers, moisturizers, activators, and more. Perricone calls these fruits and vegetables "Superfoods".

Back, or rather forward, to Berlin, to Frederick’s accession on 31 May 1740. Within two months, and thus a good few months before the invasion of Silesia, often described as his first major political deed, Frederick commissioned Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff – who would also design the great summer palace Sanssouci, at Potsdam – to build the Hofoper. (It is now the Staatsoper Unter den Linden, temporarily in exile at Charlottenburg’s Schillertheater, whilst renovation work is conducted). Kapellmeister Graun was sent to Italy, to offer employment at the Prussian court to Italian singers. Johann Mattheson, composer and critic, arguably the first German musical journalist, lamented from the safety of his position as Kapellmeister to the Duke of Holstein: ‘When will we give up our blind worship of foreigners and learn to judge our own countrymen fairly?!’ Graun’s first trawl, recruited during an eight-month tour, failed to satisfy Frederick, but by 1743, a starry ensemble including notable artists such as the prima donna Giovanna Gasparini, the castrati Felice Salembini and Antonio Uber (Porporino), and the tenor, Antonio Romani, had been engaged. Voltaire and Algarotti assisted, both in the recruitment of singers and in that of Parisian actors and dancers for Frederick’s French theatre and ballet. CPE Bach and Quantz joined the orchestra as harpsichordist and flautist, the latter’s salary increasing from 250 thalers in Dresden to 2000 in Berlin. Singers commanded salaries higher than those of cabinet ministers. By 1754, some forty instrumentalists alone were in the King’s pay. This was a rather more serious commitment and investment than ‘Cool Britannia’. Moreover, Frederick was of course not only a musical patron, but a librettist and composer himself.

In the good old days of longer lead times and higher fees, I would try to apply this method to case studies in children's non-fiction. But it's not always viable. If I need the story of a child in Eritrea, how am going to find it? Not by going to Eritrea, I can tell you. For the last few years, most case studies have come from the web - of course. Short bits, I'd quote directly and credit with the original name. If I took a lot, and didn't have permission to use the case study, I'd change the names and vary the wording to avoid any permissions disputes. Do you think that's dishonest? How much time do you think someone can allocate to chasing permissions from websites that don't reply when writing a book for £1500 in four weeks? Publishers get what they pay for - actually, they get a lot more than they pay for - and there are corners that have to be cut.

So that’s the long version of the story I told in the class. And I couldn’t agree more with the nice woman who promised to pray for me – this most definitely was a “God-thing.” From the timing of when we decided to “check it out” to having our paperwork processed in less than one-third the time it normally takes, it was clear that God was moving. As things progress now, almost a year later, it is a good reminder to me that God placed me where I am. As I reflect on how He has so obviously worked in the past, I must trust that He will continue to work in the future. He was the one who prompted that phone call that changed my life!

Anyways, the posts right now have something in common. They were all released here in the Philippines! These releases made things here in Manila more exciting. I never thought Sick Of It All and the Exploited will actually be released here. Of course these are their major label releases like the Exploited’s Beat the Bastards, ALL’s Pummel, Luna’s second album Bewithced, Eugenius’ Mary Queen of Scots, & Sick Of It All’s Built to Last. Plus I included 7 Seconds’ The Music, The Message. Though the latter wasn’t locally available, it fits the other category which is ‘major label release.’

In Chinese Buddhism he is known as Budai, the Loving or Friendly One. He was a wandering Chan Buddhist monk who lived in the ninth century. At his death between 901 and 903, he recited a poem that revealed to the world that he was in fact the Bodhisattva Maitreya in disguise. Maitreya, Chinese Buddhists believe, is the future buddha, who will return to the world and bring innumerable individuals to salvation. This concept of hope for the suffering, combined with Budai's pleasing, human features, made him a most popular Buddhist deity. It was not until the sixteenth century that he was canonised as the sixteenth and last Chinese bodhisattva.

By far the best acting done in this movie was by the man who made the first movie good. Michael Douglas, like Gordon Gekko himself, may be a bit washed up as an actor, but he still shows that the chops are still there. The idea of having Douglas play Gekko as an older man, who is wise to his once terrible ways, but has little self-control to stop himself from continuing them, is very complex, and makes his character not only believable, but almost salvages the whole movie. While other characters may have more prominent roles, the story belongs to Gordon Gekko. The story is about his personal redemption; not redemption in the sense that he's being forgiven for his past wrongs, but redemption in the fact that he can learn to know himself well enough to understand that he will never be anything but what he always was. When he comes out of prison, Gekko seems to be the propagator of sour grapes about the financial system, and is seen as a sort of nostradamus about the impending collapse. But what we come to recognize is that while Gekko does see the approaching doom, he simply can't help himself when the opportunity arises to not only get even, but get rich; and more importantly, involved. A poignant scene, is one in which Gekko is seeing his daughter for the first time in years, they are sitting in a restaurant, and he asks her a question. In the middle of her response, he interrupts her to say hello to a well-known business leader who has no clue who Gekko is. He wants the clout, he wants the contacts, he wants the notoriety. He loves the game, and we see in the end, that is all he loves, and all he has left.
Just like the visit by a Russian delegation in 2010, this visit underlines the need for global outreach within the scientific community.

Let’s start with this question. Where does your trash from lunch go? Hopefully those candy bar wrappers and juice boxes end up in a trash can. And then what happens to it? The garbage truck takes it away. Where? Here’s where you may encounter some blank stares…but some might say dump or landfill. Now really, what is a landfill? It’s a big hole on the ground all sealed up to keep the toxic nasty things in our trash from getting into our soil and water (sometimes they leak!). So here’s the big riddle: What’s the problem with landfills if we can’t reuse or recycle everything we buy and use in our daily lives? They fill up of course!
I'm have #3. Add in a toddler who pours the remains of your Diet Coke on the bed and shoves magnets into the door of the oven while it's on, and, well, you get the idea.

The reason this subject came up today, was because last night was walking our dogs with my wife. We started talking about what to give up for lent. We both had to think about it, and we suggested a change for the other. So, we decided and agreed on both. Today, we started are 40 day change program to cut out a portion of our life that we don’t need. These changes may seem really minor to the rest of the world, but for us it is huge.

The video above is worth watching in full because it shows something the press and politicians want to talk about least, the mass nature of the recent “unfortunate events.” The police in London did not lose control of the streets because they are unaware of the danger of riot or because they do not have enough heavily armed and specially trained squads ready to deal with it. They were, by their own admission, overwhelmed by the numbers of people involved.

At that time I was initially very cautious. It didn’t seem to line up with the God of the Bible I knew and I couldn’t find anything in the scriptures to back up what was happening in these places. BUT I so desperately wanted to feel God and being among passionate Christians, I thought that this was where those sorts of people were. Some of the manifestations, including the prophetic seemed exciting and it drew me in.
I woke up last Saturday with a familiar dilemma before me. You see I had some work that really needed to be done. It really NEEDED to be done while everyone was still asleep. But I also knew this was time that I could be alone with God and seek His face. I needed a “Great Moment." So I put on some worship and dropped to the ground. I called out:
In keeping with a lot of Fox movies of the time, the film opens with a declaration that what we’re about to see is a true story, shot on real locations. The cool, authoritative tone of the narrator further enhances the sense that this is something more than mere Hollywood fantasy. I’ve often found that there’s a tiresome quality to some of these earnest eulogies to the dedication and responsibility of various government agencies remaining ever vigilant in the face of multiple threats from without and within. What sets the introduction of The Iron Curtain apart is its location if nothing else. The entire film takes place in Ottawa, Canada, so we are spared yet another hymn to the efficacy of the FBI, Treasury agents or other assorted G Men. Instead, the plot follows the establishment of a Soviet fifth column in Canada during the war and its subsequent dismantling as the big freeze of the Cold War set in. As I said, the movie doesn’t takes us behind the scenes of one of those complex government sting operations that were much favoured by contemporary filmmakers, but concentrates on telling the tale of how one man brought a spy ring to its knees off his own bat. The man in question is Igor Gouzenko (Dana Andrews), a cipher clerk freshly assigned to the Soviet embassy in Canada. The first third of the film goes to great pains to establish how loyal Gouzenko was to his own country and political system, one of those resolute, unthinking servants of the state with clear and direct convictions. As we observe the steadfast Gouzenko going manfully about his duties, we’re also afforded a view into the closed world of the Soviet diplomatic mission. And it’s a drab, forbidding world at that, peopled with stony-faced officials and dripping an atmosphere of suspicion and secrecy. There’s also a glimpse at the careful construction of the spy network, whose eventual unravelling provides the dramatic backdrop for the latter stages of the story. It’s Gouzenko who brings the whole thing crashing down, and his motivation for doing so is a slow realization that he’s serving a flawed master. The catalyst for his decision is the arrival in Canada of his wife Anna (Gene Tierney), and the birth of a son. The presence of this human element greatly strengthens the story and adds to the dramatic tension of the final third. By doing so, the political aspects necessarily take a back seat to the unfolding drama of a family suddenly cast into a perilous situation.

For me, Bill is tough to describe. In fact, I think he’s just one of those people you must see in order to understand. He’s got the dry southern wit of Mark Twain, the restless spirit of Woody Guthrie, the terse, loaded storytelling of Hemingway and the leathered, hollow-cheeked look of Tom Joad. He’s an Americana hero who’s frustratingly unknown.

On Friday Bear received the first two shots. He had a bit of a restless night. Saturday morning the nurse came to the home to administer the next two shots. She asked Bear how he was doing pain wise on a scale of 1 - 10. He said he was at a six. This concerned the nurse as this was only the beginning. My husband does not complain about pain and no he does not have the 'man flu' that would be me. I knew he must be hurting because his 6 would be my 10... or in the case of someone who lives in Spain, an 18. :~)

There’s no clear-cut delineation on the settings menu. It just says there are two English tracks, without being specific as to which track is which. To inform you now, Track 1 is the ‘International Version”, contracted by Toho directly. Track 2 is the long sought-after AIP audio track. For some unknown reason, there’s no documentation ANYWHERE, either on the jacket or the menu to tell you that the AIP dubbed track is even THERE, let alone that it’s Track 2. Similarly, even on the commentary (Audio Track 5), they never explicitly say that the AIP track is included. They hint that, “Clever fans can find it with a few button clicks.”
Since they aired it in a fashion that would indicate that they were just trying to get rid of it, it seems unlikely. I have heard some suggestion that they could reboot the series, mostly ignoring everything that happened in the Spring, including the ratings. A careful retooling of the show, alongside some actual marketing could really pay off.

And no, we do not have groupies that follow us at every concert (well, except friends) because they don't let us fuck them (or to be more delicate, have sex with them). Yes, girls, in order to be a groupie you actually have to be able to fuck the band mates in a succesive order, as much as possible and as fast as possible, without complaining. This is how you get the job, God damn it, this IS your job. I should know.

The effect this fruit has had on Europe is profound, being loved and loathed in equal measure. The Clementine is very popular in France both as a fruit and as a girl’s name. However, in Germany it is considered to bring bad luck and must always be eaten in twos. The Italians consider the Clementine to be a symbol of fertility yet in Spain it is frequently part of buffets at funerals.

But here again, I found a solution. Microsoft Windows in one option for an operating system, which traditionally eats up a lot of HDD memory, but Linux based software uses a lot less. As it doesn't get hacked as much as Microsoft, there are less repair patches constantly being downloaded. Plus as the operator, Linux allows you to pick what downloads you want to install. With Windows you just had to accept ALL the automatic downloads it decided your system needed, whether you actually used the programs on it or not.
Before I had kids and started thinking about this for my family, I had never met anyone who didn't go to school. There was one person in college who was known as "the homeschooled kid" and all of his weirdness was attributed to that one fact about his past. Now that I am more involved in the homeschooling community (both locally and globally online), I know a lot of people who never went to school. I can say that in my experience, I have found about as much variation in all the usual social characteristics in the unschooled population as in the schooled population.
Still, Eulex – which costs about €100m a year and fields almost one policeman, judge or prosecutor for every 1,000 residents of this small territory – could strengthen the rule of law in Kosovo and the stability of the Balkans, and be a powerful symbol of the EU as a peaceful, rule-based force.

Over the past few years regular readers will have heard me mention and sometimes even quote from my unpublished novels. I finished Milligan and Murphy in August 2005 about three years after my play Vladimir and Estragon are Dead. I had kind of thought that after writing that I’d put my fascination with all things Beckettian to bed, but apparently not. The book was written in the two years we were living in an unfurnished flat in the Gorbals. You can actually see the flats in the photo below. They were brand new and we were the first occupants. It was a nice flat. We could actually see teams of rowers skooshing up and down the Clyde from our window. To get to work in the morning all I had to do was walk over the St Andrew’s suspension bridge, trudge across Glasgow Green and get a bus on London Road for the town centre; by Glaswegian standards, idyllic. Carrie and I didn’t have our own offices at this point and so the living room was subdivided into two office spaces and a TV-watching area. It sounds crowded but it was a big room and everything worked out just fine.

You can often find him on the golf course a few days a week.

A few birds chased each other around the oak trees in the plains, chirping with a fulfilled satisfaction. It calmed the minds of the nervous adventurers. The sun had the perfect warmth to it and, combined with a gentle breeze, the Arcane Plains felt more like a tropical resort.

Her new image was intended to up the ante post-‘Grease,’ where she surprised Danny and everyone else watching the finale by donning a pair of black pants that were so tight she had to be sewn into them. They decided on the look after several attempts to reimagine Sandy’s character – when the crew didn’t recognize her right away they knew this was the one. “It was very funny,” she says. “They were trying all of these different hairstyles and ‘looks’ and when we came up with what was eventually ‘Sandy 2’ as I call her, I walked on set and no one knew it was me. It was very fun!”

I don’t want too, and I don’t have to. First of all, let me say I very nearly had too. I have my own way of working under the constant fog of depression which does not include medication. Recently while long separated from my wife I started to struggle with intense and deep depression. Due to separation from family and circumstance, I couldn’t work it own in my own time. She asked me to talk to a doctor (which virtually means get medicated) if I thought there was real risk of harming myself. I agreed. After a few days, it sort of drained away and I was OK.

With its frank perversity, poetic monologues, black-comedy undertow and exploration of forbidden quasi-incestuous fantasy, Duffer was defiantly out on a limb. With the Wolfenden Report and the decriminalisation of homosexual activity in 1969, social attitudes were changing, and Duffer was one of the first films made in Britain to feature overt, if obliquely filmed, scenes of male-on-male sex. The sadomasochistic nature of many scenes between Dumaresq and Gleave required sensitive handling, although Despins remembers the teenage actor was extremely relaxed about the whole thing: “Kit was a very silent kid, and I can't remember where we found him. He was on the set, he said very very little, he was very amenable, so he was never ever a problem. We must have behaved in such a way - Bill, Jorge and myself - that minimised the danger of that situation for him in some way. In the sodomy scene, I quickly got out of the wider shot and just went in to a close up of Duffer's face. And that could have been shot with Bill hardly even being there if we'd wanted.”

I do like the fresh, tingly feeling it leaves on your skin, and it's not so tingly that it puts you off the product. Apparently the tingling is the Poreshrink-4 complex working its magic... That's fine by me!
Oh, yes, I did say swimming!
It also shortened the time span of the law that was previously applicable until 2019. The court ruled that that it may cover only the Communist period from 1945 to 1991 and not the period after the country gained independence from Yugoslavia and became a democratic society.

The village of Portmagee, I love all the pretty coloured houses, it would have been nice to have a little wander round there. However we were off again to do the Ring of Skellig which is a superb drive along steep narrow, winding roads that follow the coast.

First cut out your felt pieces. You'll need one long rectangle that measures almost the length of your headband. And then 3 large triangles and 1 small triangle in another color, and 2 large triangles and 1 small triangle in the last color. Glue the rectangle to the headband first. Then glue the point of the arrow (1 large triangle and a small triangle in the other color). Then glue down the remaining triangles to the back end of the arrow, rotating colors as you get toward the end, finishing up with the remaining small triangle.

Mr. Sapiens: I am sorry Miss Bowels, but there is an incoming call I have to pick. Could you please hold the line?
However holding the incoming money in cash isn’t an option as cash is a real drag on returns. So instead the money is invested when the price of the holdings is at historically high values. Now this doesn’t seem like a formula for success. This is just one more example of buying high to later sell low.
The place had seven communal cells, some of which used to be storerooms for the Portuguese colonisers, and five isolation cells, crowded so much that a mere turn of a sleeping position by a single prisoner would awaken the whole cell.
Lee Brown, who was my great-grandfather and the father of my paternal grandfather, used to grow cantelope in Quitman, in the piney woods of northeast Texas. I always felt that cantaloupe was a better word than melon. I have some theories as to why. But in this case, specifically, like many of your words here, melon seems it could march off the page as both verb or noun. Through my early to mid-twenties, I had four great-grandparents alive. I feel that gave my brother and I a peculiar ease; not only with people older than us, but also people a variety of ages. I have a photograph with Papa Brown on our stone mantle. I’m three, up on a donkey with him. He’s guiding us in overalls and a straw cowboy hat. I ended up with a pair of his overalls when he died; they are upstairs in a storage closet tote with all the cocktail attire I never wear. I wore those overalls for a long time. I still have them and can’t bear to throw them out. When I went to Boise, Idaho for the first time, all these young women—20 somethings at thrift stores and such—wearing similar clothes. When I think of Boise, I think of my favorite Ahsahta Press books. But first I think of a young woman in braids and overalls.

May Day was also a time for morris dancing and other dances, often around the maypole. In the 19th century, people began to braid the maypole with ribbons by weaving in and out in the course of a dance. Other later traditions include making garlands for children and the crowning of the May Queen.
Nole fans can’t be too happy with this right?
The Leader of the Conservative Party, Erna Solberg, recently stated that Muslims in Norway are being treated like the Jews in post war Germany. A more truthful assertion would be that it is the extreme Norwegian Left that is acting like the Germans of the 1930’s and the recipient of their rage is Israel and the Jewish people. The hatred and the vitriolic propaganda emanating from these left-wing organizations is no better than the propaganda directed towards the Jews at that particular time. The political Left in Norway, however, don’t use the same derogatory words to describe the Jews, but they use the same poisonous rhetoric, wrapped in a poorly disguised ‘displeasure’ at Israeli policies. The Left in Norway should also consider the fact that the tactic of boycotting Jewish businesses and products was embraced by the Nazis, and any talk of such boycotts leaves a bad taste in the mouth with a lot of people.
This is the reason why 95 percent of diets available today fail at helping people lose any significant amount of weight for the long-term. They do not address the mind-set at all and without changing the ‘template’ whatever is causing the overweight, unhealthy and unhappy body is still there and will show itself at some point. The ‘outer’ is always a match for the ‘inner’ – always…
And of course, I do find some Amon Düül II, though it’s not the CD I wanted. But then a funny thing happens. I’m looking at a huge wall of CDs by Austin singers and bands. Legendary Texas concert posters hang in various other corners of the store. Suddenly I feel like I’m in a museum. Austin has become a theme park of Cool. It’s Disneyland with tattoos and a wallet chain, a cultural amusement zone. It’s a brand—it’s Underground Town.

As Obama’s legal argument becomes more contorted, he is being forced to avoid an ever shrinking legal space, and an increasing weight, of his failure to meet constitutional eligibility requirements. Hill, of Genova, Burn & Giantomasi Attorneys in Newark, made a desperate motion to dismiss the ballot objection arguing that Obama’s lack of natural-born citizenship status was not relevant to being placed on the New Jersey presidential ballot because no law exists in New Jersey which says that a candidate’s appearance on the ballot must be supported by evidence of natural born citizenship status. Only the U.S. constitution restricts eligibility to hold the office of president to natural born citizens.
On the negative side, despite Auel’s research, there is a lot of conjecture because even now there is a lot about the Neanderthal that is still a mystery to us. This is not the writer’s fault, but I feel this book will date with any substantial discoveries on the horizon. Despite keeping her feet firmly on the ground and avoiding spiritual and fantasy elements, there is one scene toward the end of the book that did unfortunately dabble in a vision that we would identify as modern technology. I felt it was out of place; either make this a fantasy novel or leave it out entirely.

It’s been more than a year since Ralph got his diagnosis and the doctor told him he had maybe a couple of months to live. Death got the word and set up camp outside Ralph’s door. And it didn’t take long for Death to realize he should have packed a bigger suitcase. Ralph blew past those first two months and kept on going—not “going” as in laying around in a bed waiting to die, but “going” as in on with his life—family and work and having fun. Treatments knocked him down, but he always got back up.
When the first waves of colonists from western and central Europe arrived on the Atlantic shores of North America in the 17th century, none of them seem to have realized that they were the beneficiaries of a cataclysm. Around the periphery of the Old World, the European voyages of discovery found crowded nations with no spare territory for migrants, but the Americas and Australasia seemed all but empty. The native peoples of all three continents have reasonably enough objected to this description—after all, they were there—but the perception of empty space wasn’t simply propaganda. It reflected the aftermath of the most appalling demographic disaster in recorded history.

Baba Budangiri is small shrine named after the saint Sufi saint Baba Budan (also called Guru Dattatreya), who is revered by both Muslims and Hindus. Its origin appears to be a syncretization of reverence for an 11th century Sufi, Dada Hayath (Abdul Azeez Macci); for the 17th century Sufi Baba Budan, said to have brought coffee to India; and for Dattatreya, an incarnation of Shiva (or of Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu). It has been controversial due to political and religious tension over its status as a syncretic shrine.

It might be an interesting experiment: the metaphor beers. Take an abstraction and brew the beer to suit it. For example, Earth Day. Lesser innovators might offer a uninspired metaphor, digging through existing styles for one that is most (pick one: green, earthy, natural).

I can bemoan a few sendings off and a lot of woodwork hitting, but it still isn’t 40 points worth.

The council’s decision was to turn Air, Fire, Water and Earth against the Armada. An edict was issued for all Picts to gather at the stone circles of Callanish and Stenness. Stenness was the site of the Ring of Brodgar on the largest of the Orkney Islands and close to where the Armada would eventually pass. Callanish, on the largest of the Western Isles, was home to other stone circles and places of nature worship. Work at Callanish would protect the western coasts of Scotland.

They released a final single, 'Balloon', before changing the name to FAIRFIELD PARLOUR and becoming totally progressive oriented. The band didn't achieve success and they were unlucky at the time, failing to chart and having problems (including some sabotage) in all great gigs they had, including the famous Isle of Wight, which they were the responsibles for the 'Theme Song' of the festival (released under the name of I LUV WIGHT).
The following day we woke up, got a real Spanish lunch (not kebabs), then we hit up the Mezquita which is one thing that I really did want to see. We spent about an hour inside there, just walking through the thousands and thousands of columns that litter the place. Afterwards, we meandered through the orange-tree courtyard that sat in front. The weather sunny, despite it being very cold.
So we Human "Mom's" divided them up and headed out. Melanie and Dave were in front of the Hybrid, and I sat in the back. The box was on my lap and a towel covered them up to protect the box and the Chicks from the cool air. Chicks lose heat quickly. In their natural setting, they would be depending on the warmth from their Mom's and their brothers and sisters. That's why they are boxed tightly. On the way home, I could feel that warmth on the top of my legs as I held the box with the precious cargo.

The amount the city can give schools under the new tax cap is about $12 million below what the district says it needs to keep staffing and services at today’s level. This column reported last month that if school unions signaled they would make concessions to save jobs, the aldermen would consider shifting more city funds over to the school side.

Ekaterina: That English-language comment gave me pause too: in a general sense, we live in the world of cultural dominance of Anglophone cultures, English is the international language, and many people HAVE to speak it, and write in it. It’s a remarkable move, really: write in your own language, and we’ll ignore you; write in English and we’ll doubt your authenticity. Failure to acknowledge the cultural hegemony of the English language and WHY many non-Anglophone writers might choose to write in English is disingenuous. Not to mention, are we saying that only monolingual folks have a grasp of their own culture?

With U.S. cities moving this week to crack down on Occupy Wall Street encampments - including the one in New York's Zuccotti Park - the staying power of the movement is in question. Whatever its future, it's clear that so far, the Occupiers haven't changed many minds on Wall Street over blame for the country's hard times. The cognitive disconnect between the protesters and the captains of finance is alive and well.

No, this isn’t an advert for a new Japanese game show. This was the launch of Japan’s first LCC’s uniform. Welcome to Peach! Still unsure of why it’s called Peach, but according to the airline, the name “Peach” was chosen for its symbolism as a well-known and much loved fruit that symbolizes longevity, energy and happiness across Asian countries. – Hmm.. PR bumph if you ask me! This airline certainly isn’t frightened of making a punchy image for itself! And it’s great because of that. What the most of the western world will see as bright, garish and bold, will be seen by the Japanese market as completely normal and bland. The Japanese design culture is alien to 95% of the world, and it’s that exotic mystery that constantly draws us to the area for inspiration.

It turned out, it wasn’t and it bloomed all summer in explosions of pink fireworks 3 feet above my garden bed.

But faith is practiced. It is a life lived rather than a one-time decision to have faith. Faith is required at every turn, or, as James puts it, Faith without works is dead. It is as if we are, on a regular basis, required to make decisions in which the obvious choice, the one that feels right, the one that seems safest, the one that appears to promise us the highest level of peace and comfort is not the right choice. We generally know that it isn't the right choice, yet we experience these crises, both large and small, as we learn to trust in God instead of our own understanding.

In 2007, his best friend died right before we came to visit for Christmas. In 2009, he lost his job right before we came to visit. Could it be that he then started equating this place with horrible things and therefore was unable to adjust because in reality, he hated it. Instead of home, it felt like horror to him? Could that be part of it? I know things can get into your subconscious that way and shape the way you react. I know there is a perfume I was wearing when I got into a really bad car wreck and if I smell it, I freak out. I didn't make the connection the first time it happened.

The ingredients for the standard Campbell Soup Vegetable Soup have not varied much since its original production in1899. Nor surprisingly, carrots, potatoes, corn, onion, and garlic still dominate the recipe. A gradual lowering of the sodium content has been one nod to the push for a healthier life style. None of the ingredients for this soup come from abroad - a true “Made in America” product. Carrots from California, Texas and Ohio, potatoes from Colorado, Texas and Kansas and onions from Idaho are examples of the nation wide scope needed to maintain the raw ingredients.
I feel alive by doing exercise, such as running or jumping, or doing anything that makes me phisycally exhausted. Then, after that, I go to the internet and see a lot of things that make me sad and I just feel like I have to work out more to kill all that sad things on my mind. This is good actually, for my body and for my mind, but it kills me to see the problem and I can't do anything about it, so I just have to forget and occupy my mind with something else, which is... running.

The text messages reveal that he was talking in what would appear to be a normal friendly tone to what Jason Kidd’s daughter would describe as a “Big Brother.” Until, he would change the conversation with sexual inuindos along the way.
I think that in order to live happy, healthy lives we need to pretend that our lives have meaning. We need to pretend that lawns are worth mowing and that advertising is worth doing. You see what I'm getting at here?

Mr. BOLAND asked the President of the Board of Trade whether his attention has been called to the threatened boycott of Irish products, with the exception of linen from Ulster, on the passing of the Home Rule Bill; and whether he proposes to take any, and if so, what steps to safeguard the normal development of trade relations between Great Britain and Ireland?

So I didn't even know I'd won. I didn't know until I got an email from one of the other finalists that arrived Saturday night. May 5. My birthday--and the unholy extravaganza known as Cinco de Sandra. I had woken to an entire day spent shopping for beer, bottles of water, chips, pretzel goldfish, gummi worms, tablecloths, flowers...and a fancy dress because damn it, I haven't bought a single item of clothing in over a year. I got out the construction paper and the rubber cement, made five small signs and one big one. At 7 PM we got access to a space that had to be ready by 8 PM. A man came up and said "I love your work," and I asked him if he could help assemble a table. A man walked up and said "Happy Birthday," handed me a mini bottle of Knob Creek, and walked away without ever telling me his name.
At Discover Magazine, Carl Zimmer maintains an index of words he has banned from his science writing class. I wonder about some of the choices – context, processes, via? – but Zimmer’s intent is explicitly educational, and his explanation is more constructive and nuanced than is typical of would-be word-abolishers:
When it comes to literary representation, I've heard the phrase "shopping for an agent" a few times. Honestly, I didn't think much of it until it came time for me to "shop" for an agent of my own. But I've learned it's not really like shopping at all. There's no trying agents on to make sure they're a good fit. No 30-day return policies. No exchanges--at least not right away. You have to simply research it out the best you can, decide what qualities are most important to you, and hope you find someone with those qualities who also happens to like you in return.
I Love New York For Her is the crowd pleaser at my job. The ladies love feminine fragrances. Anything that veers masculine is given the "side eye". The notes for this fragrance is mandarin zest, spicy nutmeg and the boldest blueberry note ever captured in a fragrance. The middle notes are just a cornucopia of pretty. It is a bouquet of roses and pink peonies. The drydown is patchouli, musk, vanilla sandalwood and a naughty touch of leather. The lasting power of the blueberry note is much too brief. I wanted it to last forever.

We all worked our butts off. I was in charge of over 60 volunteers, who were all fabulous and hard-working. The next day I was more sore than if I had run a marathon. My arms, legs, butt, everything was aching. After working 7 days straight I was given a glorious day off yesterday and I enjoyed every second of it.

This little vintage fur stole was a timely addition to my wardrobe, as it was absolutely freezing in my office today. Not exactly a welcoming first day back after a holiday break spent relaxing on a warm sunny beach south of the border.
I removed about 3/4 of the icing from the bowl and mixed green dye into it to make the "grass". I used a Wilton Tip #233. To make the grass, squeeze the icing in the piping bag gently and lift up as you stop squeezing. After covering the cupcake completely with grass, place the ladybugs randomly on top.
The GTX 670 uses the same GK104 chip as the 680, but with one SM (Streaming Multiprocessor) unit turned off. Kepler’s SM groups are referred to as SMXs and were rearchitected, rather than being based on Fermi’s. The GTX 670 has just 112 texture units (down from 128) but keeps the GTX 680′s 32 ROPs.
I made some soup here in the office, hoping to nurture and comfort anyone who needs it. Cooking seems to set things right, if just for the small moment of chopping and heating and listening to the simmering broth.
I picked up Official Book Club Selection because Home Safe, last week’s read, was decidedly emotional. I figured this book wouldn’t be, and I was partway right. Griffin does touch on some emotional stuff—her flirtation with an eating disorder, her botched plastic surgery, the aforementioned pedophilia—but a self-deprecating celebrity story is never far behind.
2 Cor 6:14,17 (NIV) Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?… “Therefore come out from them and be separate, says the Lord.”

The theme for this week’s SCS clean and simple challenge is “chic.” When I think of chic, I think of fashion, so I turned to the fabulous dress form image from the Waltzingmouse Stamps So Lovely Set along with a trendy coral based color palette and a few other fun embellishments for my card.

Finally we checked today after she made more threats yesterday claiming she did not receive the deed and the lien was never filed and lo and behold, the deed was in fact recorded by her, and the release had been recorded by the county a month ago. She was lying when she claimed the register of deeds told her yesterday it was not done. Quelle Suprise. We also find on the deed that she changed the grantee name from her name to her trust (by hand) without our client's permission when she recorded it - can you say fraud? I knew you could.
The three chefs, all who have outdoorsy-type experience, are sent to remote locations in order to forage, hunt, and then cook inspired dishes with native ingredients using only the most primitive of cooking methods and the most basic culinary equipment and spices supplied (basically knives, pans and cooking vessels, salt and pepper only, no electric appliances allowed).

The question, “Who can send a message to Garcia?” become synonymous with being resourceful and having integrity to do one’s job without dissolving into a puddle of helplessness. Hubbard stated later, “The hero is the man who does his work – who carries the Message to Garcia.”
It's always a good idea to read something you've written in a very different place from where you wrote it. I decided reading it in some corner of The British Library would be just the thing -- you don't get much more special than that. It's a place I've never been (shame on me). I would be excited to go there. It would be a treat. What a great idea. But timing is everything, as they say, and I will be ready to do the read through just when I have to be back in the States for a series of family events, first New York, then Boston. Well, I may not be able to go to the British Library this time, but hopefully I'll be able to go to another couple of very special places -- the New York City Library and Harvard's Widener Library (if I can get someone to give me a pass. Ooh, maybe I can use my SOAS connection. Now there's a thought).

Eventually it was discovered there were multiple yet simple reasons for our inability to conceive, and a couple months after a hysteroscopic procedure I miraculously got pregnant the "old fashioned way" as they say. It had taken three years by that time, only to sort of happen suddenly by accident. We were elated.
The terrible twos have snuck up on me and I am not prepared. I know it is a phase and it will pass but I feel like I need some words of wisdom to help me prepare and forge through with some level of sanity.

Words can't really do justice to the amount of appreciation and gratitude that we feel for Mom and Joe (Jason's Mom and Step Dad). They have been such a blessing to us during this time in our lives and it has been so much fun having them here in Virginia.
It's autumn again... and at our place that means, among other things, a big crop of pumpkins. Once again, I can't claim any gardening skills to produce these lovely wonders. They come up of their own accord out of the compost heap, and this year they've been given oomph via pig manure.
Have you ever heard of Bally's? Well, Lalanne had over 200 gyms in his name before he eventually licensed all his health clubs to the Bally company, now known as Bally Total Fitness. A lot of those machines in there...his inventions. That is pretty impressive if you ask me.
The best part about this review is that there is also a GIVEAWAY.
Pintxos means spike in Basque (pinchos in Spanish), referring to the toothpick that holds the ingredients together, often on top of a piece of bread.

The creativity is amazing. How about Vegan tortellini made with pineapple, banana, mango, scallions and pine nuts in a coconut alfredo? Tom loves mushrooms so he ordered "Hey Jude." The lyrics go "Don't Carry the World Upon Your Shoulders, our magical mushrooms are deglazed with onions & roasted garlic, in an herb'd cream sauce, lightly finished with a balsamic reduction & truffle oil over penne." This is definitely a Grammy award winning dish!
Though I haven't been sewing much, I did make it out to a quilt show this weekend (thanks to a very proud daddy who pushed the stroller and chatted with all the nice ladies at the show who wanted to know all about the baby). I picked up a few treasures.

The funny thing is...none of this has really changed anyone’s driving habits, including my own. We all still putter to work in our gas-chugging SUVs, and salivate as auto manufacturers roll out all new versions of V-8, hemi-powered Mustangs & Chargers. Face it...we’ll continue to fill our tanks no matter what the cost. When it comes to gasoline, we’re a nation of highway heroin addicts. And when the day comes when we can no longer afford it, we’ll steal it...hell, the number of “gas ‘n’ dash” crimes in this country has already risen dramatically.
Grease a 9x13 pan with margarine or spray well with pan spray.In a large pan, slowly melt the margarine over low heat. Add the marshmallows and stir constantly until they have completely melted in with the margarine. Remove from heat. Stir in cinnamon and vanilla. Add the rice cereal and candy corn. Stir until well coated. Spread margarine on your hands and press into the pan lightly until even in the pan. Chill, then cut into squares.

When I was still a Sophmore in the U of O Art department an e-mail went around the department for some company (Imagination International, Inc) looking for a graphic designer. Paid position! I was between freelance gigs at the time so I replied. I guess I was the only one who did, so I was given a Japanese brochure, a disk of images, and an English translation. My task was to make a US version of the brochure for these new markers. I hadn't seen Copic markers before, so the more I worked on the project the more intrigued I got.

Richness: Complex arrangements, counterpoint or layered timbres, along with harmonic invention and lush overdubbing can achieve a sense of richness in music. In painting, texture, variation of colour, effects of light and shade and detail can provide the same sense of richness, as can the choice of deep, intense colours. In a novel, the intricacy of the plot, evocative descriptive language, or the inter-relationships between characters, or the number of simultaneous sub plots (or parallel plot threads that culminate in the chaos of a well-written farce, as in an episode of “Fawlty Towers”, for example) can give the writing some richness. In application design, it can be the range of functionality or the number and variety of third party plug-ins or presets that can make the application feel rich.
Couple of problems here. Nowhere in the press release from the state government, and political class of Kansas, is there any sign that this program has been successfully implemented before in any other location. There is also no indication that an inexpensive market research program was done ahead of time that quantified how effective this program might be. It looks like this program was just thrown out to see what might happen, taxpayer dollars be damned.

Greenan's first book It Happened in Boston? (1968) is something of a cult novel uniquely mixing the surreal, the absurd and the sinister in what has become his trademark in these rather hard to classify books. He went on to write several books each one utterly strange, utterly different. The Queen of America (1972) details the story of a couple of too smart for their own good teenagers, one of whom has a nasty habit of making tape recordings of his neighbors conversations, and the menacing female hitchhiker who becomes part of their lives. In Heart of Gold (1975), a story similar to Anthony Rolls' The Vicar's Experiment (aka Clerical Error), we learn of the life of a duplicitous, sometimes murderous, minister. Another story of antiques, theft and murder is The Bric-a-Brac Man (1976), a book which reveals Greenan's arcane knowledge of Japanese netsuke and the world of antiques in which he spent some time as a buyer and seller. Some of his latest fiction is now available via Smashwords. His work is vastly underrated and one of those rare writers who once sampled will be savored. I guarantee after reading any one of his books you'll be back for more.

Next up are baby samplers! I think in all I've stitched three but I've only got photos of two. First up is the Noah's Ark design that I stitched for my friends Beni and Silke who have twins. I thoroughly enjoyed stitching this design, it's so colourful, and I think animals are just great for kids. The hilarious thing about this is that I chose the design and started stitching it and then one of my friends said, oh great idea- the animals came in two by two, perfect for twins! I hadn't even thought of that, doh!! So it worked out even better than I thought!!

If one treats the share of subjective terms for each party as wholly positive, things improve for the Conservatives and Greens. Their net scores become positive. This is particularly important for the Conservatives in the branding of their party. If they can convince voters that subjective terms associated with them like “conservative” and “aggressive” are virtues, they have a shot at reversing an otherwise overall negative party brand. The potential of party brand rehabilitation is less of an option for the Liberals. Of the four nation-wide parties, only the Liberals still suffer from and overall negative party brand if all of the subjective terms respondents associated with them are regarded as positive. In other words, the Liberal Party brand is the most injured and battered of the four nation-wide parties. Not exactly the best place to start from if the Liberals are seeking to halt and reverse their decline. The Bloc Quebecois figures, meanwhile, need little elaboration on how dire they are for them.

Bright blue skies, and chilly! I had my doubts about this morning while I was coming home from work last night, it was still foggy then, but it has cleared up nicely. I haven’t decided if I am going to do one or two laps today, I have to prepare for the kayaking trip tomorrow, making sure that I have everything packed and picking up my boat from the storage unit I rent. One way or another, I had best get moving, as it is getting late. I woke up when I wanted to this morning, but my body and my brain had a debate as to whether I should get out of bed or not, and my body won, so I went back to sleep for an hour or so.

In addition to her novels Christie wrote and published 160 short stories in her career. Almost all of these were written for publication in fiction magazines with over half of them first appearing in the 1920s. They were then published in book form in various collections, some of which were identical in the UK and US (e.g., The Labours of Hercules) and others where publication took place in one market but not the other.
Readers of A Canticle for Leibowitz will recognize the tone present in most of these stories, even though the settings are often vastly different. Often there are characters thrust into nearly unbearable situations, facing moral crises of some sort or another. In the first story, "You Triflin' Skunk!," Miller tells the story of a mother and her son, who has come into contact with a shape-shifting alien race who seeks to establish contact by forming bonds with the natives. However, in choosing a family whose father/husband had deserted the family, things go awry. Miller's almost laconic conclusion serves to underscore the emotional conflicts stirred up with this failed infiltration attempt.
An additional feature includes the ability to adjust settings to provide differing levels of student support. Level One questions and sentence starters relate to what a students sees in the image. This is a perfect level for my Beginning and Early Intermediate language learners. Level 2 adds questions which require inferences. My Intermediate and Early Advanced speakers find this challenging at first. Finally, the highest level lets students create their own story without guidance.

Ah yes. God forbid the star of the show be upstaged by a second-fiddle beauty.

We enjoyed the location for a few minutes, then hit the road to meet our next runner. This leg was so cool because it was a little celebration everytime one of us finished. A little panic attack as the last 2 exchanges had no port-o-potties....no idea what happened but we got our runners to local gas stations/restaurants in time. Phew! Through all of this Runner 11 had moments of not feeling very good, but I have to say that she was awesome and never once let any of us take her legs. She is a rockstar! We headed to the finish line and had to pay to park, which everybody there thought sucked. Yeah Ragnar, that really sucked!

Have you heard of the expression, “Keeping up with the Joneses?” Better yet, for today’s youth, it is probably more like “Keeping up with the Kardashians!” This expression was coined in 1913 by a newspaper cartoonists who poked fun at people who tried to keep up “materially” with their neighbors.

Clearly, Maneesh Sharma is a talented director and the strongest parts of LVRB are the rare occasions the characters become three dimensional but sadly, he does not get enough time to explore that aspect here. Even on its own merits, LVRB could have been a much better film if it had not gone with the most obvious route of trying to please everybody but instead, give what some viewers may think is a familiar premise a different treatment. Rather than compare LVRB to BBB, it has more in common with Yashraj’s previous release Mere Brother Ki Dulhan which did not have any ideas above its station and did exactly what it said on the tin.

What’s even more troubling is that in Nigeria, the country that has arguably suffered most from oil drilling, oil “accidents”—large and small—occur almost weekly, and we hear little about it. A lethal combination of sloppiness, corruption, weak regulation, and lack of accountability has meant that each year since the 1960s, there has been a spill the size of the Exxon Valdez’s into the Niger Delta. Large purple slicks cover once fertile fields, and rivers are clogged with oil leaked decades ago. It has been called the “black tide”: a stain of thick, gooey oil that has oozed over vast tracts of land and poisoned the air for millions of Africans. In some areas fish and birds have disappeared: the swamps are silent.
Once I saw that configuration, I loved it! Oh, it looks so neat and orderly! I decided that the two drawers in the back left would hold a few things that the stack had been holding before anyhow. The top drawer has some plastic bags that our new curtains came in that I plan to reuse for something else and our extra vacuum bags. The bottom drawer has extra light bulbs, a heavy duty extension cord that needs to go out to the garage yet and the casters that were on the bottom of the stack of drawers.

"Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple. When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak. When his time of service was completed, he returned home. After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. "The Lord has done this for me," she said. "In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.""
General impressions. Well, we spent some time in Texas, then a roadtrip along the gulfcoast through Texas, Louisiana, Missisippi, Alabama, and Georgia to Newnan, Georgia where RDG grew up. Most of that roadtrip was fast interstate travel, just passing through. Interesting for me, though, passing all those places I've heard of but know next to nothing about, places better known for their appearances in songs, movies,and books.

During the 1980s conflicts in key Nile states re-emerged, including civil conflict in Sudan, and in Ethiopia a new intensification in the civil war, with rebels emanating from northern parts of Ethiopia and Eritrea (a province of Ethiopia at that time) fighting to overthrow Mengistu’s government. The military support provided by different sides based on regional and international cold war allegiances – in particular the role of the Soviet Union in providing concessionary oil and huge amounts of military hardware to Ethiopia – helped to fuel and prolong the conflicts. Many of these arms remain in the area and help to fuel smaller conflicts at the local level.

Okay, so I've been wanting to make him a certain scarf, and I will try again this year, though it might not work out. Also I've heard that K is now leaning towards gift exchange. That's fine, though at the moment I'm not sure what I would get him, as I gave him the handmade scarf last year and a different scarf another year, and even if I had the time he doesn't need yet another scarf. So far as I know, R and J still want to exchange cards, so I will get them something small or baked goods, and I will get something for G that would either be baked goods or something like that.

This post is the perfect platform to declare my love for meyer lemons. If you've never tasted one of these gorgeously sweet citrus, I hope it will be on your to-do list for the week! Meyer lemons are ideal to bake with and give that perfectly intense citrus flavour to sweet treats. This lemon loaf can, of course, be made with run of the mill lemons but try making it with organic meyer lemons if you can - you won't be disappointed!

The KJV must be the only work of literary genius to have been produced by a committee. The group of great scholars had unparalleled qualifications. Most of them had spent most of their lives in the pursuit of God and knowledge. One translator, Dr. Lancelot Andrews, mastered at least 15 languages and by the time he was 6 years old, had read the entire Bible in Hebrew. Some of the translators had written foreign language Dictionaries and Lexicons. They commonly debated in Greek, they translated and edited great works and they wrote their own. Not only did the translators know the Biblical languages of Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, but many also knew related languages that enabled them to study other documents and translations by the church Fathers in Persian, Coptic, Syrian, Chaldea, Latin, French, Italian, German and Dutch. Some of the translators prayed five hours a day. The translators were world class scholars, Christians who lived holy lives and were prominent as deans, professors and presidents of major colleges of Oxford and Cambridge.

Well if that’s the case, he should do all within his power to stop the rise of Islamism and Islam generally. No one hates pluralism, tolerance and diversity more than the Islamists people like Bell romanticise – the Brown Exotics (like Hamas).

And by the end of this, I didn't want to touch anything so "traditional" for at least a short while.

Hello Everyone!!
I have never been able to understand how some people feel perfectly comfortable airing their soiled laundry. Maybe I'm sort of obtuse, but whatever happened to discretion? What does this woman have to gain, writing a book about an extra-marital affair she had with a man 50 years ago? It can't just be about the money. It's no secret that JFK was a womanizer, so there may be dozens, perhaps hundreds of women out there who have similar stories to tell as Mimi Alford, but in my opinion, the ones to be respected are the ones who have actually kept their mouths shut.

I'm not obsessed with my garden, but I am a tiny bit excited about getting it going again. I used to grow vegetables and stuff but that awful dog in the photo above put the kibosh on that, because he eats everything. EVERY. THING. So now I pretty much only grow herbs on my awesome dog-proof herb table and flowers in the front beds where the dog can't get them. Last weekend I pruned my roses and cut back a bunch of dead stuff, and today I bought some lavender and cilantro to replace what died in the inferno last summer. I came thisclose to buying basil and some patio tomatoes, but it could still freeze here so I restrained myself. Barely.

Ian asked us, as he often did in this very interactive workshop, whether we thought this year, 2012, would be just another year. Few if any of us raised our hands. He congratulated us, because this is the year that the Mayan Long Count calendar changes over, see: http://hpanwo.blogspot.co.uk/2010/03/2012-rumours-of-our-deaths-have-been.html. And of course we’re now in the fifth year of the financial crisis, and he is convinced that this is a contrived event. Even the former head of Goldman Sachs, Greg Smith, is speaking out about the corrupt nature of his old company. The board of Goldman Sachs in private speak with open derision about the majority of their investors which they call “muppets”, while the important members who are destined for better fortune are called “players”; however I imagine one can become the other at a word from one of the board-members. (I wonder which James Randi is! See: http://hpanwo.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/other-side-of-james-randi.html). The current financial domination of the world dates back to the signing of the act in 1913 which brought into being the Federal Reserve; luckily that act has a sunset clause and was always planned to expire after just ninety-nine years; well the Fed Act was signed on December the 21st of December 1913… so is there anybody else who still thinks 2012 is going to be just another year? There’s a video on YouTube of a stockbroker called Alessio Rastani speaking with really explosive candour that was later pulled by the BBC; here it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC19fEqR5bA. Rastani himself has been discredited and demonized as a fraud and attention-seeker; a common tactic used against people telling the truth. Rastani is basically and frankly telling the viewer that the financial system is doomed, while the Government is trying to keep the public harnessed to the hopes of its recovery packages. Ian’s parents are in their eighties and Ian often tells them that they are the last generation of working class people in which the family can live off the single basic week income of the father. Today in a working-class family it is rare to find a situation in which both parents don't have to work every hour they can just to make ends meet. The Euro Crisis, together with the collapse of the US Dollar are the lead weights that will drown the world. Nigel Farage, one of the few politicians I’d trust to tell me the time of day, is willing to speak out in the European Parliament and expose this elephant in the room: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llDYLb7HoIk. Unfortunately, it’s a little-known fact that the EU Parliament is just an adversary body and has no legislative powers at all. The unelected EU President and his cabinet make all the decisions, even if every MEP votes against them. (Farage was involved in a light aircraft crash during his 2010 General Election campaign from which he luckily survived. I wonder if it was an accident.) Greece, as a nation, no longer exists, and is now wholly-owned collateral of the European Central Bank. Even its priceless antiquities have been sold to try and alleviate its horrific debts. It seems the crucial kingpin, as has been the case for the last few years, is Ireland, which is why Ian has been touring Ireland a lot lately with his friend Jim Corr, see: http://www.jimcorr.com/. On May the 31st the Irish people go to the polls in a referendum, just like they did with the Treaty of Lisbon; and so there is one more chance to scupper the EU agenda, but will the “NO” vote work this time? Are the Irish people awake enough to avoid the same trap they fell into over Lisbon?

After shopping, we drove to Austin (30 minutes from San Marcos). Our first stop was the University of Texas. This may have been one of Craig's highlights, but we were not able to stay long. We met his high school friend, Nathan and his wife Melissa, for dinner at Kerbey Lane. It was a wonderful place, and we had fun catching up. Then, we went to see a play with them. We had a fabulous Friday in San Marcos and Austin.

A little different twist on Jesus’ Golden Rule, which appears, by the way, in some form in virtually every spiritual tradition. I turned the words around, however, because I’ve learned that you only ever do to others what you do to yourself. And, conversely, you do to yourself what you do to others. I think it was the Buddhist, Pema Chodron, who first taught me this. So I can’t help but wonder, when a nation like the U.S. goes to war and kills others, there’s perhaps a sense in which we kill something within ourselves in the process. Which is probably why the Chinese say, “Before seeking vengeance, better dig two graves.”

So today I was able to start fresh with new words, knowing it’d be adding on to my real word count. I’d intended to spend most of the day writing (and doing laundry; I was behind), but of course stuff happens and it didn’t quite work out that way. But I did make my goal. I’d told myself – and a friend – last night that I would write 1,000 words today, thinking I’d totally blow past that goal that. Well, I passed it, but just barely: today’s count was 1,007 words. Not bad. Certainly better than my average and I’m officially on my way to replacing everything I just axed.

These communities have not been deprived, they are self-deprived. They are not oppressed, they are oppressing themselves. The disparity in power has long ago shifted their way, if they have all too often chosen to use that power in a destructive way, the fault is their own. It cannot be healed with more affirmative action, more apologies and more power shifts. The last three years have made that painfully clear.

It's no secret that Obama and his fellow radical impostors use the EPA as their stick to defeat normal Americans to follow their agenda. They can't use the Cap and Trade route as the GOP voted that down. So, they had to come up with another 'legal' way to still get their way. So, what better way than to use a governmental agency to do their 'green' purge? What better way to stop development and progress than with the EPA who can thwart any attempt by arguing it's not in the people's, or Earth's, interest to say, drill for oil, or build a new pipeline. Don't think these radicals aren't clever. They are way cleverer than us. They've already decided their contingency avenues if their first push doesn't work. Same with Obamacare. If it's found to be unconstitutional, these fascists will find another way to clobber the American people into line - probably in the form of an Executive Order. Obama has issued Executive Orders to bypass Congress whenever he can't get his way through the front door, and it's usually days later that people realise what he's approved via EO. It's become his everyday way of ruling his Empire - who needs Congress? The EPA is just another tool that Obama uses, so it's always refreshing when the extremist idiots who head up these agencies inadvertently expose the way they really think. The latest gaffe is for the head of the EPA to lecture about crucifying people who don't agree with their mind-think collective. Yeah, great democracy! Democracy - especially in America - has become the Trojan Horse that radicals use to hide behind when they push their rotten agenda down people's throats. Let's hope that whoever is the next new POTUS, they'll close the EPA and other totalitarian government departments down as quickly as possible, for the good of America and the world.
So basically the government has put a lot of money to stabilize prices -but at the same time transfers generous sums back to the privileged few- and to recruit many more civil servants – that might not be needed or do not have what it takes- the result is indeed a stimulus package, and it might as well be working by providing the boost for GDP growth, but it will not last long, and the benefits of such an overkill are not that obvious.
I think that from time to time in your life it's really nice to step out of regularity and the things we do day to day, especially when we have kids and things become more about them than they are for yourself. It's not a BIG thing, it's not a cruise or a vacation away from your family for days, but it's something meaningful to YOU. If you don't have that 'thing' in your life then put yourself out there to find your thing... Take the time by yourself or with a friend and may I suggest:

When news came to Skadi, one day, that her father had been killed in a dispute with the gods of Asgard she was distraught, her ice heart shattered. For many days and nights she walked the passages of Storm Home crying her grief and rage into the wind, her tears sparkling in the ice of the walls and floor. Skadi felt that she would never laugh or find happiness again and she found herself lonely in the empty draughty hall. Finally as the storms of her grief abated, and her heart froze over again, she resolved that she would have her revenge on the Aesir for Thiasi’s death. She dressed in her warmest furs and a mail coat, took her bow and arrow and her skis and began the journey down from the frozen mountains to the plains of Asgard.

West Ham’s love of I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles dates back to the 1920s. The song was first used in the world of sport in the country of its origin – the United States.

And just a year later, during the World Series scandal of 1919, the so-called Black Sox affair, it was pressed into service with its lyric amended for satirical purposes to “I’m forever blowing
Aside from the adrenaline-pumping fights, a Seal warrior slits his young son's throat, for one thing. Before that, one of Marcus' men is decapitated, and Esca and Marcus come across several bare, headless bodies hanging from trees. Esca comments that the Britons did that. Esca also tells Marcus that when the Romans attacked and took over his land, his father slit his wife's throat before the Roman soldiers could take advantage of her. Completely on-screen, Marcus throws a knife and kills a Briton at the end of a skirmish, and I guess there were a few skulls lying around in a couple scenes.

Well, the bleeding continued all day. It was pink and mucus-like, which made me feel better because it wasn't bright red and it wasn't just blood. I basically had a light period all day with occasional light cramping. I decided that if it continued the next day I would call the doctor because this really was just like what happened the last time when they found my cervix was effacing. I was also afraid that maybe I was leaking amniotic fluid, even though it wasn't really watery, because it was just so mucus-like and thin.

This is the end of week one of my new nutrition program. This last week I focused just on eating regularly and I am so excited by these results. Four to six smaller meals at regular intervals every day. Here are my results:
Of course, these lies would only be reserved for people who didn't know me very well. I'd never have the energy to keep up the pretence with people close to me ( I'd probably be too exhausted from the heat, for a start). My family think I have Seasonal Effective Disorder (SAD), except a different way around to the way it normally happens - i.e. I start cheering up when the nights draw in. My husband thinks it's more complicated than that. He says there are only two days of the year when the UK reaches its optimum temperature for me; at all other times I'm either too hot or too cold. He might be right. But give me too cold anytime. It's easier to get warm when you're cold, than it is to cool down when you're hot. Plus, it's better for sleeping. Does anyone else have a problem with sunny weather, or is it just me?
“OMG!!!!!”

Atemi are feints or strikes that are used as attacks against the vital points o the body. This movement is meant to cause much damage; so it is rarely being used in aikido. Still, if there is a need, one can use atemi in fighting your way out of brawls. It can also be used as a form of distraction. Atemis can take your opponent by surprise and break his concentration by providing a startling incident. When used the right way, it can also ruin your opponent’s balance, which can provide an opportunity for you to strike or to run away.
And the first signs of this failure are the dramatic events unfolding in the aftermath of the Iranian election which have turned his new diplomatic outreach to the foes of America and his hopes to placate them into shambles.
To Do List this week:
Daddy and Ella had a great bonding weekend, baby was well fed, clothed, clean and happy, house like a bomb had hit, despite the cleaning lady coming Friday. But it didn't really matter, the chance to get away to scrap for 3 days and 2 nights is worth coming home to baby bottles, baby food and toys everywhere and clothes still on the line. Daddy is sitting next to me saying how tired he is. I missed them both like crazy, thank goodness for mobile phones and MMS pics arriving all weekend.

When it comes to purchasing headphones for your iPod or any other type of MP3 player, you will find that price does play an important factor in terms of quality. When purchasing a headphone that has a price range of -, you will find that the quality is by far less superior to those that range between 17 dollars and up. One of the first things you will notice is that the actual quality of sound differs greatly from one headphone to another.
An incentive to intern for a longer amount of time is that the subsequent SMarT Leader may be chosen from the pool of current CHiRP interns who have been committed to their position with OikocreditUSA for 3+ months. This CHiRP intern will be invited to Washington, DC to complete a summer internship with Oikocredit USA, providing them the opportunity to interact with other microfinance professionals and organizations such as Mftransparency, Women Advancing Microfinance (W.A.M.), and Grameen Foundation.
Yep. I just did.
Now, however, the much discussed Carla del Pontae's book, "The Hunt", offers a harrowing detail, revealing why have Serbian men been kidnapped throughout Kosovo province during past years instead of being killed on the spot, as is the usual K.L.A treatment for all non-Albanians, especially those of Serbian ethnicity: because they were used as a livestock for organ harvesting in the illegal trade with human organ transplants.
But there was neither gas nor electricity on the farm; Wilma found her way up to bed with a candle, and was frightened of the moving shadows in the stairwell. They burned peat on the fire; the beds were covered with patchwork quilts, and there were rag rugs on the oilcloth-covered floor. You washed with a jug and basin.

I also simply love the look. Sexy high heeled sandals and solid-colored tights are slimming and lengthening, not to mention, they can really help pull an outfit together. This lovely combo makes winter clothes look less frumpy, and summer clothes (like dresses and skirts) look more weather appropriate. Edgy sophistication. Beauteous, isn't it?

And they are made to have a long shelf life… The objective is not to give you a healthy product. It’s to give you a product that will make you buy it, will last long, and will make a lot of profit for the company making it.”

But will not the administrators become the new ruling class? Democratic organisation does indeed involve the delegation of functions to groups and individuals. Such people will be charged by the community with organising necessary social functions. They will be chosen by the community and will be answerable to it. Those who perform the administrative functions in Socialism would be in no position to dominate. They will not be regarded as superior persons, as tends to be the case today, but as social equals doing just an essential job. Nor will they have at their command armies and policemen to enforce their will. There will be no opportunity for bribery and corruption since everybody, including those in administrative jobs, will have free access to the stock of wealth set aside for individual consumption. The material conditions for the rise of a new ruling class would not exist.
I was recently flipping through the channels and did something I rarely do: I stopped on the Christian station. I began watching a well-known Christian speaker preach to his congregation on the famous promise to Abram found in Gen 12:2-3. To my amazement, the pastor left out the most important part of the passage and only read and commented on the following: “I will bless you and make your name great” (he actually used some contemporary translation that said something like “I will make you famous and distinguish your name”). I was floored. The preacher went on to talk about how God wants to make your name great and distinguish your name, and he then gave examples of people who started following God and saw their careers advance and their name become distinguished among their peers.
As each player tells his or her story, Muniz becomes absorbed. He is inspired by their cooperation, horrified by the conditions, and is taken up by their tragedies. He is also captured by a poetic idea: using the garbage collected by the pickers, and arranged by them, to create their own portraits, one of which will be subsequently sold at auction in support of ACMAJG.
"Indeed, I think that people want peace so much that one of these days governments had better get out of their way and let them have it."
And that’s because despite everything else, I find a way to regularly keep it organized. Don’t get me wrong – I may slip up and have too many black shoes at one time (is there really such a thing?), but I definitely have a distinct method of cleaning out my shoe closet and keeping it organized. You may decide to tweak some of these, but at the very least – it may be a starting off point.
That first night there was a little exciting. I realized I forgot all of Nick's catheter stuff at home. And that I really should get to a walk-in clinic, because I did not have eczema! I had a very contagious virus that luckily my cousins had all had before and that meant they couldn't catch it again.
With a scowl, he looked down at the bowl of candy and then back up at me with a what-are-you-trying-to-pull look on his face. But then he smiled, held his bag out to me and said "Twickatweet, mama." I took one of his own candies out of the bowl and dropped it into his bag. LG giggled, ran into his bedroom, jumped up and down on his bed a few times, and came skipping back for more mommy-trick-or-treating.
So I have given in to their demands.....and i made these....
But I got tougher and after freaking out when Hubby bought home The Walking Dead TV series, I actually sat and watched it with him... if by 'watched' I can count running in and out of the room several times screaming. It's now one of my favourite shows (although I still can't look most of the time) and I am addicted to the graphic novel of the same name. I even have a PINTEREST board of ZOMBIES.

The plot has few surprises for anyone familiar with the Arthurian legends. If anything, the well-worn tale makes the novel more poignant, as events rush to their inevitable conclusion and all the characters’ struggles to escape their fate merely serve to entangle them further. As well as the story of Gwynhwyfar, Arthur and Bedwyr, the tale of Gwalchmai and the boy Gwyn, begun in Kingdom of Summer, reaches its conclusion in In Winter’s Shadow. I noticed some deft references to other legends, for example the relatively minor character of Sandde Angel-face who appears in Culhwch and Olwen: “no-one placed his spear in him at Camlan, so exceeding fair was he; all thought he was an angel helping”. No doubt there are lots of other subtle references like this that I missed.

So I ordered 30 plants from fothergills online, and we watered the strawberry bed right at the very end of the allotment very heavily before covering it with multi purpose compost and then a membrane to prevent weed growth. I then made a slit in the membrane for each plant and then added a top layer of bark which will keep the slugs off the strawberry fruit crop come early summer..
After having written those few scenes, I now understand why it’s almost impossible to write a grief-stricken character. All the tears, the pain, the nausea, the inability to focus, the not sleeping or sleeping too much, the not eating or eating too much add up to a character who appears as a wimp and a whiner. We are so used to invincible characters who manage to fight despite grievous wounds or agonizing pain, that a normal character living a normal — though grief-filled life — comes across as a weakling. Another problem is that a character who cries at her own pain, who feels everything herself, eliminates the need for readers to feel that pain, and so they dissociate from the character. But the very nature of grief is feeling pain. It’s by embracing the pain, by letting the tears spill over, by giving in to the grief that we come to terms with it.
Stable humus is used up en masse by plowing and high nitrogen fertilizers. On the other hand, its formation can be encouraged by following the soil growth generative sequence, and by the addition of chopped roots of grass species (to restore mycorrhizal fungi) or black carbon (biochar). Rotational grazing where feasible optimizes conditions for photosynthesis and humification. And how can we tell we are getting somewhere? Soils with high humus content feel sticky to the touch when rubbed between the fingers.

Christianity should be about a relationship not religion. I have so much more I could say on this subject. This is something that God is constantly showing me more about. The state of many churches today scares me. It makes me ask “What is the point?” Why are you going to church? Are you letting it change your life? Or is church just something you do on Sunday’s? Is God an active, living part of your life? Are you bearing fruit?

Bullard with Bollocks! I really like the man, the way he deftly plays back the Ace card to his bemused opponents, who thought they held the Race card and had the whole game sussed. It's too beautiful. The little spat between Bullard and Mangcu (I still cannot pronounce that name, damn) and others such as Makanya and Khumalo, is still wending it's merry little way, with said proponents becoming ever more bemused and perplexed as all the little race cards they thought were so invincible, simply turn to dust.
I have found some excellent opportunities along with my copy editing certificate program, including volunteering for Triangle Art Works and Clean Energy Durham in various writing and editing applications. It has been nice to use my skills to contribute to a cause, even if I feel like they’ve been very small contributions thus far. I have the chance at an “internship” but I’m a little hesitant to take it, mainly because I don’t want that on top of everything else if I DO get one of the jobs I’ve applied for. There is one in particular that I especially like.
But my point (yes, I do have one!) is this: if the entire world is nothing more than a trick of our perception, then we can change that world.

Remember the post I did about my son’s communication device being broken at school? The device was broken at the end of March. We sent it to Words+ to be fixed. My husband called them and got the address to send it to, and an estimate on what it will cost to repair it. He packed it up and shipped it out. We waited for a phone call that never came. You would think that they would call us when they received it. No. It just sat on a desk. It was looked at, but that was it.
When the first world war broke out, R. HaKohen Kook was caught outside Israel, where he had to spend the war in London and Switzerland until 1918. In 1916 he became rabbi for the Mahzike HaDat in Brick Lane, London, and upon returning to Palestine, he became the rabbi for Jerusalem until 1921, where he became the chief rabbi for the Ashkenazi Jews in Palestine.
Then we were taken to a Buddhist temple.

13 years ago, on a sunny May morning Tony Blair walked into Downing Street and, with many others, it felt good to be a Labour supporter, it felt good to have change, it felt good to have a young prime minister who promised so much. For the first few years Tony could do no wrong. He was even called Teflon Tony – nothing stuck. But the Iraq war came along and it all went pear shaped. We were fighting a war on terror and then our civil liberties started to be eroded, countless new laws were passed, ID cards were mooted, CCTV cameras exploded into bloom like cherry blossom on every street and the Labour government, which promised so much, started to become repressive, authoritarian, divisive and disorganised. In Number II, rather as the Minotaur of Knossos did in mythology, the Chancellor lurked, scheming, plotting , burning with ambition, to take over the mantle of prime minister which, rightfully, in his mind, was his and his alone. Gordon Brown has been a disaster for the country and for voters like me who were prepared to back a vision of a fairer Britain. I need not, of course, rehearse the many disasters with the economy in recent years, for everyone has a view on that.

It began when Joseph arranged to meet his parents for dinner at the Harvester, ah the Harvester, fine ghetto dining. And whilst his parents are by no stretch in the gutter, they do like to have a drink (and a Harvester). As we all know, drunk people are fine when you yourself are drunk, when you are sober, that's an entirely different matter. When you are their child, they quickly become insufferable. Whatever posessed Joe to suggest that his mother lay off the booze we do not know, perhaps we never will. What we can say for certain is that Joe's mother reacted as only a small, fiery Irishwoman could. She exploded.

There are many things to consider with the art of supplementation, and a good place to start is with your doctor and blood tests. Every year I get the annual run-of-the-mill blood test for basics, and I also get a micronutrient test that my naturopathic doctor orders. We take these results into consideration, along with many other things. I’ll vary what I take based on my goal for longevity, the physical activity of my life, as well as whether I’m pregnant, breast-feeding, trying to conceive (fertility), stressed, ill, looking for more energy, cleansing, detoxing, hormonal and/or traveling (considerations: ease of packing, where I’m traveling and for how long). I also split up my supplements and take them in two or three batches throughout the day. Some are taken with food; some are taken on an empty stomach.

McCain has become a weak candidate in the blink of an eye. Not so long ago we all believed we knew where he stood: strong defense, fiscal responsibility, a free trader who supports NAFTA, and a man who makes his decisions based on a strong inner moral compass. While the first points haven't necessarily changed, the last couple certainly have. Add to the fact that he has courted the conservative Christian right, which was NOT part of his M.O., and you have disappointed centrists such as myself -- not because we disagree with his views, mind you. Centrists probably are as divided as the rest of the country on issues such as abortion, gay marriage, violence in video games, etc. Our disappointment stems from the obvious pandering to a segment of the base that it's fairly obvious McCain doesn't belong to.

My solution to this embarrassment is to wad up a piece of bathroom tissue, forming a hood that contains the tiny spill. My slacks hold this cap in place just long enough to catch any fleeting beads, until the wad gradually works its way down my leg and I can pull it out and deposit it in the can. It’s a pretty good system, as long as you can subtly pivot at every turn to check your tracks and make sure you’re not depositing a trail of crumbs like some latter-day Hansel and Gretel.

New York Times bestselling author Laura Griffin chills with her newest novel of suspense and romance in the award-winning Tracers series, when a woman police detective in a small Texas town discovers that the only thing more terrifying than a killer you don’t know . . . is the one you do.
Not only did I try to squelch my insatiable lust for Mexican cuisine all night, but I was also missing Eli Manning hosting Saturday Night Live. See, Rock and Roll is all about sacrifice my friends...and DVR'ing shit. Only the hard working bands were playing out that night, all the others were stuffing their face with quesadillas and mainlining Patron. All the way across the country, The Black Keys were playing a concert in Sacramento. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were playing in Newark at The Prudential Center, (a venue I'd love to see The Dirty Pearls play at, but one step at a time here) but the most monumental show in the entire country was happening on East 23rd Street in NYC.
7:40 Jesse Jackson Jr. He looks nothing like his father, but he sure sounds like him without the mushmouth. But he strikes a slightly different tone. He’s a better speaker at this point in time. He doesn’t come off as what a lot of people identify as a stereotypical African-American; like Obama he strikes me simply as American.

The next in line would be the propane grills, as they have similar features of the natural gas grills. The only issue keeping Propane grills from being equal to natural gas grills is the fact that you must provide the propane somehow. This usually means hauling and handling propane tanks.
Gert here…as usual HO/Pilgrim must make sure that everyone knows that she did nothing to provoke…only everyone has already seen the attacks that HO did to other adoptees, on this thread, before Ruth and Gert arrived, and then of course, as soon as we did HO attacked and then created/brought Pilgrim on for more attacking. More words of JW/HO are All she asks is that she be left in peace… if she wants to be left in peace why is she on this thread browbeating adoptees? and again the assertion that shehas not launched any kind of attack herself, and, unlike the other 2, has shown herself to me to be a lady and gentlewoman. And the fact that Pilgrim has to assert that HO is a lady/gentlewoman, there MUST be a reason for SOMEONE else to come to poor HO’s side! The use of I’m on your side is another form of copying Gert and Ruth’s style of our dual nature of our comments, where we bouce back and forth telling the truth of a situation. JW/HO is also a copy-cat.
I’m sorry if this is weird. I’m weird. Again I don’t want to turn people off to these things. They’re really awesome once you get over the fear.

Viewpoint – 1st person, 3rd person etc. First person is a great way of creating immediacy more intimately than 3rd person, it speaks directly to the reader. 1st person, however, should only be attempted once a writer is experienced and confident enough to tackle a novel or long story because of the verb and tense confusions that arise.

3. I can't figure out how to thread my 1929 Singer, the stitches are off and it sews so smooth and quiet. I bought a cheap Singer for $80.00 just so I could finish my project. Let me tell, I am going to give the machine away, I am not going to try to sell it. It is so light and after sewing on my Janome sewing on that cheap Martha Stewart Singer is like taking a step back into the dark ages. The Singer is great for a young kid who is just learning to sew. The machine is cheap plastic.
“We plan to cross list courses between the consortium campuses,” Talbot said. “For example, UCR offers about seven courses in stem cell biology,” Talbot said. “Students from Loma Linda or Cal State San Bernardino could tap into this educational opportunity through cross listing.

Today was a nursery day for me. We had babies. Actual little babies. Not the sitting up, nearly walking little people I’m used to in there. Little, teenie, tiny infants. One of whom was actually awake. Not a good thing for this woman who has discovered that the biological clock is real and doesn’t care if you already have three. Even as she was screaming in my ear I was thinking I could do this one more time.

During the 1981 riots Enoch explained that the way to find out what was going on was to read European media because British media obfuscates the truth. Those riots he pointed out were attacks on the police. At the heart of the recent riots there were also attacks on the police which included firing at them with handguns in Birmingham. The media behave like the media in the Soviet Union where what the ideology said was happening was pushed by media rather than what was really happening. Russians were constantly told there was no crime in Russia.

I'm not setting a deadline. How long I let the entry period run depends on the number of entries, traffic, and whether this giveway makes it into this Saturday's "Ink Links" at The Pen Addict. I'll pick a winner when I'm ready. Good luck!
Short post today but I feel like I'm still playing catch-up from my time away. It was a fabulous reunion and I enjoyed every minute of it except coming home with a cold. :-( Sniff, sniff, cough, cough.

What makes evolution such a tricky game, however, is that fitness landscapes often shift dramatically when the environment changes. The most robust network of organisms (each themselves a network) is the one which can adapt to changes in the environment. Rigid organisms often die off when their environment changes around them.
And what of my father, a man who crept in and out of both the house and my life with barely a footfall? He brought me into his study, a room I had never entered. There were egg boxes covering the entire wall space. He explained these were a cheap way of sound proofing, which had been insisted upon by my mother for whenever he played his HiFi in the room. And they must have been remarkably effective since I never heard any sound escape into the belly of the house. I wondered whether they also protected his ears from her ground quaking gyrations in the lounge. He announced that he wanted to record my voice, on a wall mounted cassette deck he'd secured from a music studio that was being decommissioned.

We also traced the cap to the wood putty to create a template to create a small notch in three places along the back of the unit, which were cut out with a jig saw.

But with P.D. James, I hoped that a writer of wit and culture was going to give me something to care about. Alas, no. Though Ms. James makes a very good attempt to duplicate the arch sophistication of Austen’s prose, and comes up with some wonderful Regency witticisms of her own, this type of writing is largely abandoned after the first chapter. However, it is more than fascinating to see how James comes up with a few trenchant alternate explanations about Elizabeth’s real motives in snaring Darcy and how her so-called friends (I speak now of the duplicitous Ms. Charlotte Lucas) cynically reacted to their wedding. Come chapter two, however, and the novel becomes a dry, British procedural, with only flashes of Austen’s brilliance surfacing from time to time.

I found a map that was drawn in 1660, the first street plan of Manhattan , which conveys every street, structure, meadow and garden in the settlement. It was the world of my characters, and it was the geographical jumping-off point of my work. Also vital was the discovery of the orphanmaster function, an official job that was needed because of the dire trend toward parental deaths through sickness, shipwrecks or Indian incursions. And I also was surprised to learn

Characteristically certain types made allegations of abuse and mistreatment. However, top Yemeni lawyer Sheik Tariq Abdullah recalled: "They were very rough. They tried to show as much restraint as possible but in general during that period you would find most of the people complaining."
It’s also not that I don’t enjoy the process of sewing up. I think it’s mainly that I can knit anywhere and often whilst semi-distracted, but to get seams and button bands and collars correctly placed needs a bit of time set aside, a flat surface and some concentration, and creating those conditions isn’t always easy. This is also why my bolero is sleeveless right now. Sewing the sleeves together; there are three pieces to each sleeve, was fine with a bit of pinning, and I was able to do some of that on the train. Similarly the body was fine although attention was required to make sure the lines of the pattern matched up, one section being done twice to make sure this was the case. However, inserting the sleeves is a more delicate operation requiring correct placement and managing the stretchy character of the fabric, setting the top of the sleeve correctly at the shoulder and dealing with the excess that creates the shape and line correctly. The kinds of things that done well, are pretty much unnoticeable because they just look right, but done carelessly, look so wrong and scream their wrongness at every wearing.
Hm (hang on while I get my drinking cup and find my best lounging position): Yes, I'd say there's a stage in writing a piece of fiction, usually an initial stage, when it can seem to 'come' without your having to think about it in any very conscious way. It's as if you're 'hearing' the sentences and seeing the images on a screen which somehow miraculously has been presented to you. It just 'happens' to you, as it were. (And when you're 'blocked' it's as if you know there's something there, but you've not yet been shown it and can't yet 'hear' it!) I guess this is why people talk about 'inspiration' and also why people ask writers where they 'get their ideas from', as if the ideas are just out there waiting to be picked up or tuned into. In fact, of course, it's coming from you, but at this stage in a largely subconscious way. It's what I call the 'dreaming' stage of writing, and yes, I do consider it the important and real one, because this, I find, is when I get the rhythms – and in some ways rhythm is the most important thing in prose, in creating a 'voice' – and also the associations and connections which I'd be less likely to come up with were I thinking more logically. So this, I would say, is what always characterizes my first draft. Often when I go back after that less conscious stage, and look at what I've written, I am amazed by meanings I wasn't aware of earlier. Of course, the editing stage can also show up the fact that you haven't made sense, but I do also think you need to allow for the fact that you don't always see straight away, on the logical, editorial level, the things which your subconscious has spied (so always be prepared to put back things you've cut, is my advice)
The motion concludes that Dr. Meehan’s testimony would impeach the myriad, mutually contradictory, versions of events presented by the accuser (most or all of which appear to have claimed no sexual contact for a week prior to the party). Moreover, the defense motion states Meehan would be expected to discuss the rationale behind the decision he entered to with Nifong (a/k/a the “client”) to intentionally not report the exculpatory DNA evidence.

The plants were cut out at 3.5" using the auto fill feature. Chalk them up a bit if you'd like. Then cut slits in the circle large enough for the plant bases to slide thru.

At work we’ve always got tons and tons of bananas lying around and evidently, not enough demand to eat them before they get overripe. They usually go to waste, since few people actually want extra-mushy bananas. During my first week there, a coworker of mine took the extra bananas home at the end of the week and brought a fresh-baked loaf of banana bread in on Monday morning. I decided to mimic her idea–except I made banana muffins–and I don’t feel like sharing, so they’ll all be for me and any friends who come over next week!

This summer, for the first time, I caught one of those huge ferries that traverses the Mediterranean, carrying Italians off to their tanning destinations in Sardinia and Corsica. The coastlines in these areas are truly magnificent, and the sea considerably less almighty than the tossing Pacific. Unlike our sunny day trip out, the return voyage took place at night. Very quickly the aisles and seats downstairs were crammed with sleeping bodies. Kids on beach towels, fathers with mouths open gently snoring, brutally tanned mothers texting girlfriends at home. I left my lot and went up to the deck under the scant summer stars, found a bench under the gigantic funnel with its growl and plume of smoke. It was a long windy night and the ship moved fast, gliding through black water.

There is a secret in every single word he wrote. It had many meanings. Hence the most translated and interpreted spiritual text becomes Bhagavad Geetha. See how beautiful the poet has put it! A huge ground where people stood with arms, ready for a war, for a piece of land. Amidst that two friends, a charioteer and a warrior. They were checking the other party’s strength and deciding about plans. Then all of a sudden the warrior recognizes the faces as his uncles and cousins.

The final characteristic of an effective umbrella is that the user has the option of using it or being exposed to the elements. As a boss, giving your people appropriate levels of autonomy to make decisions and live with the consequences is a key to being an effective leader. As individuals gain competence and skills they need to be able to make decisions and act independently. If they know their boss has their back and will help them when things get ugly they will make better decisions.

Pat of the fun of being a sci-fi fan in the 1970s was that the success of Starlog magazine (which owed much of that success to the unprecedented popularity of Star Trek reruns in syndication combined with the one-two boxoffice punch of Star Wars and CE3K in '77) inspired a number of other publishers to flood the newsstands in the latter half of the decade with science fiction film magazines of their own. None of them matched Starlog in quality or longevity, unfortunately.

I keep hoping that we've put enough time between us - it's going be 3 full years this September. I just wonder - what happens when I get into graduate school elsewhere - away from family - my name will be Google-able - what then? Do I change my name? Do I tell my future school I've got a CEF I don't want showing up at my office hours? Or am I still talking and walking like the same wounded woman I was 3 years ago. I am not sure which is worse to be honest.

Notice how the left side of the cake is all shadowy, but details on the right side are lost due to too much light. If you try to adjust the lighting in the program that came with your computer, you’ll tear out your eyebrows in pure frustration. It’s flat impossible to edit a photo that has too much/too little light (unless you have Photoshop. Maybe it would work. I have a disk for Photoshop Elements, but my laptop’s CD drive is broken and I can't install it...insert sad violin music). I use other programs, but I've got to have something to work with...and it all starts with the L-word.
We also urge smokers not to take risks with the amount of nicotine they may be getting from electronic cigarettes. Why take a chance that you may be getting a lower amount of nicotine than you get with your usual Marlboros, Camels, Newports, Winstons, and Kools? With these tobacco cigarettes, you can count on the tobacco companies to provide you with a carefully regulated dose of nicotine in each puff. They have spent years perfecting the carefully titrated and consistent delivery of nicotine. But with electronic cigarettes, you're dealing with amateurs. They really don't know what they're doing and there's no way to be sure that you're getting the precise amount of nicotine that they say you're getting. Why take a chance when you can get a known amount of nicotine?
Two rounds later, the Giants picked up another offensive tackle. He is described as extremely lean and tall with much room to bulk up. The Giants have many options with the offensive line. They plan on starting Will Beatty at left tackle, but still need to find places for Mosley, McCants, James Brewer, and Sean Locklear. This is Beatty’s last season of his contract so this could be why the Giants picked these younger kids up. “Really a pleasant surprise when you watch him,” Reese said. “He is intriguing. Long, 36-inch arms. He is 315 now and I think he will be 325 pounds in a blink. Very interesting prospect for us. I think in a year or so he can make some headway and start challenging for a spot in our starting lineup. I think he is going to be that kind of player for us.”
Angela Duckworth, assistant professor at Penn, sums it up: “Here’s why: learning is hard.

Skirt Lifter Imperial Hefe Weiss - Or, as I have thought about calling it: Banana beer! It fermented a bit hot, and so there was some very strong banana esters. So strong that it disguised the fact that it is about 8.3% abv. (OG 1088, FG 1026). It's muddy, though. I have racked it to secondary and will keg it this weekend. But when I racked it, I discovered the source of the muddiness: the spigot was an inch below the surface of the yeast cake!

The Boswell Sisters travelled to Los Angeles where they performed on local radio and “side-miked” for the soundies, including the 1930 production “Under Montana Skies.” They did not attain national attention, however, until they moved to New York City in 1930 and started making national radio broadcasts. After a few recordings with Okeh Records, they made numerous recordings for Brunswick Records from 1931-1935. In 1935, the sisters had a #1 hit with “The Object of My Affection“, the biggest of twenty top 20 records they would enjoy.

We were very lucky this year to have lots of good food, family, and friends celebrate with us. Aunt D'Arcy flew in from NYC, G'Ma and G'Pa flew in from Atlanta, and honorary Aunt Linda and Uncle Tony stopped by to share Christmas Eve dinner with us. We missed our Ohio relatives, but we talked lots on the phone and were able to wish everyone a Merry Christmas.
Borges got bored easily, especially in the decades he spent as an old and blind man, and his claim that conflict and chaos are the seedbeds of art may have been intended as a provocation, rather than a serious argument. When we consider the masterpieces created by writers, painters, architects, auteurs, and even poster-makers in early twentieth century Russia, though, it is hard not wonder whether Borges might have had a point.

The exaggerated reports however on the compensation culture are misleading. Most people don't sue for every little thing, and many of those who do don't get anything. And, actually, I agree that when one's safety has been compromised by someone else overlooking or ignoring the rules, one should be compensated. Not in the case of an accident, unless due to reckless driving. But a shop has a duty to keep its floors clean of spilt liquids. If someone slips and breaks a hip on a spilt drink which the shop have not cleaned up within a reasonable amount of time surely the injured party should be allowed to sue.

In the end, I figure that this may be our only foreign car we buy. By the time we're in the market for another car, American hybrids will probably have caught up in price and mileage. I bet a Chevy Volt will be in our driveway in five years.
However, now blacks are using the one drop rule to advance their own political agenda. Given that half of black pregnancies end in abortion, blacks must have some means of keeping their numbers and corresponding political influence from dwindling.
The NFL revealed on Monday which teams would receive compensatory picks in the upcoming April draft, and the Raiders won big. Because they lost the likes of Nnamdi Asomugha, Zach Miller, Robert Gallery & Thomas Howard to free agency last season, they are now owners of compensatory 3rd, 4th, and 5th round picks. This injects hope into an previously barren draft; Oakland had only two picks (5th & 6th rounders) going into Monday, so this news gives new GM Reggie McKenzie a punchers chance of finding quality, NFL starting talent at multiple positions.
Treatment options for drug addiction include application of medication such as naltrexone, buprenorphine and methadone for patients who have an addiction towards opioids. Those who are addicted to substances like tobacco can be effectively treated with the help of varenicline and bupropion or nicotine preparations including lozenges, gum, nasal sprays and patches. Alcohol dependence is successfully treated with the medications such as acamprosate, disulfiram, topiramate and naltrexone.
The social self is also one of the main vehicles of magic. I wrote two weeks ago about the extent to which human social interactions are mediated by nonverbal and nonrational communication—body language, gesture, vocal tone, facial expression, and all the other communicative methods we have in common with our mammal relatives. These are the channels of communication through which people fall in love, make friends and enemies, establish their place in social hierarchies, claim a larger or smaller share of whatever resources are to hand: all the things that baboons and beavers and the rest of our nonhuman kin do with comparable signals sent through comparable channels. Baby baboons and beavers pick up facility in this language in their early years, and no doubt absorb all kinds of lessons about their social and physical environment through the same means; so do we.
January always seems to be a rough month for us. Here's to better health in Feruary!
Day two, you’re normally wondering what the hell you’re doing and how you’re going to survive.

The beautiful dress that Ulla Popken sent me to review is listed under their cocktail dresses. The Sequin Surplice Chiffon Dress is so pretty and classy! I couldn't believe how comfortable it is to wear.
The major works chapter focuses on Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, Shirley (by Charlotte Bronte), Villette (also by Charlotte), The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (Anne), and their poems. I thought that since Agnes Grey by Anne and The Professor by Charlotte were the only two novels left out; maybe they just should have included them. I’ve read all of their collected works and I think those two novels are worth reading and discussing as well. I know the chapter was titled “major,” but if that were the case, I probably would have left out Shirley and Villette and just focused on the most famous work by each sister.
Ettling goes for the single leg take down, and eventually he gets it. He tries to mount, but doesn’t. Marx has him in half guard, and then sweeps and gets on top.

In John 15-17, Jesus declares his loyalty to his disciples as friends and reminds them that he has been sharing with them everything that the Father has revealed to him. In addition, Jesus is leaving to prepare a place in the Father’s house for his friends (14:2), and that he when he is gone he will endow them with the resources they need to do the task they have been called to preform, the Holy Spirit (14:26, 16:12-15).
Things are going great!

On the other hand, White Western Christianity is by no means monolithic. The story of Western Christianity in the last five hundred years has been a story of endless schism and we now have over 30,000 different Protestant denominations. Will breaking free from the cultural hegemony of White Western culture produce 30,000 more different denominations in the African Church and the Latin American church as well? In the Reformation people broke away from the Catholic Church and refused to accept it as authoritative so the Reformers really could not stop people breaking away from their teachings or refusing to accept their authority. After all, if the Roman Catholic Church could be wrong, so could Luther or Calvin. In the same way, will we see endless fractures as people break from the hegemony of the White Western culture find they too are unable to stop people breaking away from them? Probably.
I was overjoyed to share our chicken experiences with others. There was much interest in our birds and I even got a laugh or two. I certainly look forward to sharing more stories in the future.

Calling the plan “unprecedented,” lawyer Robin Seligman said the government should have first stopped the intake to clear the backlog. Prospective migrants might now think twice before applying to Canada, she added. “How can you trust this government?”
One thing I've discovered about aspirin, the plain ol' house brand works for me the best. I don't need the fancy name brand at all! I can remember when we were kids and had a fever, Mom would sometimes give us an aspirin dropped into a coke! What a treat!
I pointed out that she really was just being TOO kind...
Brotherly (and sisterly) love really is a special gift...and, I am glad that I am able to experience it in this life.

Microwave/convection oven. Quick meal preparation and cool operation. The convection oven will do just about anything a gas oven will do, except heat up the interior of the RV. A gas oven is nice, though, when you don't have electric hookups and don't want to disturb the peace and quiet with your generator.
I'd rather not say. You never know who might find this blog...
Once the oven is up to temperature, bake for 15 minutes before reducing the heat to 150C and baking for 45 minutes more. Cover the loaf with a sheet of foil for the last 15 minutes if it’s looking too brown.
When we went to pick you up we brought all kinds of candies with us (not that we would bribe you or anything? ;) and you wanted nothing to do with fruity, gummy, suckers, or anything of the kind. On the way home in the airport we bought chocolate....and you have loved it since then. As you used to say- chockick. (in your sweet soft voice).

The best rakeback deals usually arrive through the smaller on the web poker sites, given that it’s 1 with the couple of ways a brand new online poker room can compete with the large boys like Complete Tilt or Pokerstars. With that in thoughts, there is a straightforward reality in poker; most poker players drop. Taking this 1 step further you’ll be able to see the a lot more players a website has; the more losing players a web site has. In addition, an organization known as “bonus whores”, lower limit grinders, who play a really tight game, tend to adhere to the cash, and signal up at online hold’em sites with great rakeback deals and hold’em deposit bonuses: This floods these smaller on the web poker sites with an abundance of reduced restrict grinders who are not the most profitable opponents to experience in opposition to.
Alongside this are various running skirmishes between Lord Mandelson and the Tory Party as Murdoch endorses the Tories in the May 2010 Election. Mandy alleges that the Conservatives have struck a deal with Newscorp to neuter the BBC and allow Newscorp to gain share against it. The proof of this, it seems, is Coulson in the position of ultimate power inside 10 Downing Street.
