We were reminded of the former all night. Whether it was lighting up a blunt thrown to him during “Roll One Up” or his ear-to-ear smile after a leopard bra landed on stage (“Our first!” he yelled), there was no question whether or not Rocky exudes the star-power many up-and-coming rappers lack live. He commands a crowd in a likeable way — think the opposite of an entitled diva — making his entire set feel like an inclusive party. When he ran out of songs (he only has one album and a couple stray songs), he announced he was "not done partying with y’all.” So his DJ played rap classics — Juvenile’s “Ha,” Big Tymers’ “Still Fly” and most appropriately his hometown heroes The Diplomats' “Dipset Anthem” — while Rocky and his buddies drank 40s, puffed strong and danced.

What I would do if I could do something else: Fire investigator. I have handled numerous fire cases over the years and have even passed the test to become a certified fire and explosion investigator.

Apologies for the comment were forthcoming, and rightly so. Certainly raising five boys must be considered "working." A chorus of mothers would testify that raising children is hard, stressful, but joyful work that can send you crawling to the pillow, dead to the world by day's end.

To nobody’s surprise, Adele Adkins finished 2011 as the year’s best-selling artist. Her sophomore album "21" entered the Top 10 in early ’11 and never dropped out.

School districts forced to reduce staff because of declining student enrollment, reorganization or financial problems no longer would be banned from laying off a tenured teacher while keeping staff members who have not yet earned tenure protections. Under the bill, teachers' seniority and salaries could not be a consideration when administrators choose which teachers to keep, and performance would need to be the most important factor in those decisions.

But in three years of hanging out, drinking beer, and playing around the holes-in-the-wall and honky tonks of central Texas, Eli had never heard a hint of anti-government cant from Stack. And never a hint of rage.
One thing that seems clear is that some of these kids - and we're thinking about WR Brandin Cooks here - look Pac-12 ready right now in terms of poise, athleticism, and strength. ... maybe Cooks doesn't know all of the plays right now, but good grief, it looks like he can play. Soon. He's very sure-handed as a punt returner, btw, although this isn't a coaching staff prone to trust a pup with returning punts.
It would seem to be completely in line with the intentions of those original veterans to build this playground for the present and future children of the city, those children in whose interests and for whose futures we have often been told the wars have been fought.
George Soros is turning his legendary hedge-fund firm into a $24.5 billion "family office," a move that allows it to avoid a new level of regulatory oversight facing many hedge funds.
Over the past several years, we have lost that balance, and failed to appreciate the connection between our national security and our economy. In the wake of an economic crisis, too many of our friends and neighbors are out of work and struggle to pay the bills, and too many Americans are worried about the future facing our children. Meanwhile, competition within the global economy has grown more fierce. So we simply cannot afford to ignore the price of these wars.

Regardless, the OHSAA has a better game plan than it did a year ago. Fixing Division I while simultaneously working on a new competitive balance referendum boosts both improvements. Granted, the Division I fix is only for football. The Division I disparity is even larger in basketball and other sports, but in Ohio, football comes first and everything else is details.

"No, I don't think she understood that," Hull said, wiping away tears. He was sitting in an armchair in his spacious old office overlooking the bay at Fort Mason, his face lit and shaded by the fading light of a beautiful late-March afternoon. Hull is the poetic principal librarian at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. There was a picture of a smiling, 16-year-old Kathy on the table. She was photographed in a blue parka aboard the Alma, the park's flagship scow schooner, sailing the bay on a sunny day in 1993, the bridge in the background. Hull painted a picture of life after Kathy, his voice floating and trailing into silence.

Lisa Olson, FanHouse: "Birthed as the Washington Senators in 1961, the Rangers have gone longer than any other team without reaching the World Series. Now Ron Washington, the manager who tested positive for cocaine last spring -- a singular moment of weakness he'll spend a lifetime repairing -- has his team one win away from the Fall Classic. Fantastic story of redemption and second chances, but still weird."
In an April 13 letter to President Barack Obama, 22 mostly Democratic senators asked him to suspend deportations for students who might have been eligible for legal status under the Dream Act - young people brought to the United States as children, who in many cases consider themselves American, speak English and have no ties to or family living in their native countries. If such blanket protection is not possible, the senators suggested streamlining the process for students to seek authorization to stay individually.

“Pretty” might not be the right word. Best-known for plays such as “The Pillowman” and the film “In Bruges,” McDonagh is never a mild-mannered writer, but “Lieutenant” (which was nominated for a 2006 Tony Award as best play) might feature his most extravagant carnage. The play includes torture, execution-style shootings, even -- brace yourselves -- cat mutilation.

The Red Wings have been the best franchise in sports over the past 20 years. Its no coincidence that Lidstrom has been there for every single one of them. Of course theyve had other great players, great coaches, great management and one of the most dedicated owners in the game. But its hard to imagine this run without Lidstrom. It took no greater authority than Yzerman himself to declare that Lidstrom was the most valuable player on the team back when the Stanley Cup run first started. Lidstrom won one Conn Smythe (2002) for his four Cups, but that was almost like a Michael Jordan award. Just as Jordan really should have won the MVP every single year he was in the NBA (other than the Washington Wizards years), Lidstrom really should have won the Conn Smythe every single year the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup. Yzerman, Mike Vernon and Henrik Zetterberg were all worthy. But come on. Do the Red Wings win any of those Cups without Lidstrom? Not a chance.

We thought round three between these two might come in the Big East Tournament semifinals -- boy, are we glad it didn't. The problem in the first two is that Hasheem Thabeet and DaJuan Blair never had great games at the same time. Blair went 20-20 in the first matchup, while Thabeet held court in the second -- both Pitt wins. Not much has changed for Connecticut since its last meeting with Pitt. This is the first time that Dyson's absence hurts the Huskies in the tournament, as Fields can run wild without his defense. The hex continues for UConn as Pittsburgh joins the Steelers in Titletown. Pittsburgh, 81-72.

Sean Meagher: Like any coach, Nate McMillan has his flaws. Is he a perfect coach? Of course not. But he's proven to be the right guy at the right time for Portland. He is one of the hardest working in his craft and his strengths -- namely his ability to keep this team from completely falling on its face when adversity strikes (which, in Portland, is too often) -- and his dedication are why McMillan is highly regarded by his peers and in NBA circles. His lack of postseason success is the glaring smudge on his resume in Portland, but there is nobody in the organization who wants it more than McMillan. Now he's got two more years to do it. Hopefully the injury pendulum will swing in his favor.

Turn the apples and onions several times to coat them, cooking another minute or so.

Yeah. ...When he came to tell us he was gonna leave, in that room right there, he said, "Where's Mrs. Ilitch?" And I said, "She's in the back. She can't handle this. She'll start to cry." I could see it kind of jolted him, it was that emotional. It was a shock because we all thought he was gonna stay here. But then things changed. He decided he wanted to be a GM.
Earlier, the team acquired Portland forward Kenny Cooper for conditional allocation money and next year’s first-round pick.
As we ambled back toward the tasting room, I asked him what he considered his signature wine these days. His answer surprised me. He said it's the L. Preston, the proprietary name for an earthy blend of black grapes long associated with France's Rhône Valley, in particular syrah, cinsault and mourvèdre.
Detroit got a surprise gift when Iowa tackle Riley Reiff fell to them at No. 23. Reiff has the potential to turn out to be one of the top OL in the draft. It’s not unlike Iowa tackle Brian Bulaga’s fall to Green Bay two years ago. Chicago took a bit of a gamble on Boise State’s Shea McClellin in the first round. There were still some other pass rushers on the board when the Bears picked. Hey, McClellin might turn to be fine, but guys who rise from second-third round picks to mid-first round picks always scare me. Minnesota actually did OK. They got Cleveland to bite on trading one spot in the first round and came away with three extra picks in the process and still got USC tackle Matt Kalil, the man they wanted.

Gas Connectors are not a substitute for gas piping. To start, here's a photo of a gas connector - it's that corrugated yellow thingy. Most newer gas connectors look just like this one. A gas connector is used to get from the gas piping to the appliance - that's all. Gas connectors should never be used as a substitute for gas piping. This means that if you ever see two connectors joined together, it's an improper installation. This material is not a flexible gas line. It's a gas connector.
But does that matter? For people who saw and loved the 1984 original, is Kenny Wormald re-creating Bacon's angry dance in a warehouse enough to make you remember what you liked about the first one? Or can you enjoy it on its own? When well done, the answer is both.

The group is also trying to get the medical community to collaborate in research, funding and early detection of autoimmune diseases. The organization's recent report on the global state of autoimmunity proposes a new category of doctors called autoimmunologists "who can provide a full perspective on autoimmune diseases, develop an overall patient management plan for specific diseases and refer patients to related specialists when needed."

Hearing is my sense that is most strained during the summer. With the windows open, everyone gets to hear really loud music from poolside, parties or passing cars, as well as the shrieks of children at play. It seems half the population rides motorcycles without mufflers. Lawnmowers and trimmers roar until total darkness. And, whether or not we go to the official displays, we get to hear the frequent explosions of firecrackers and illegal fireworks in our neighborhoods, followed by the inevitable sirens.

Our tax rates, and our overall tax burden, were also the worst in the region. And the effects were being felt: a study by scholars at Boston College found that $70 billion of wealth had left the state in the prior five years. That exodus hurt jobs, economic growth and yes, even state tax revenues.

Rookie contract holdouts are always a possibility, but they seem woefully out of date in these tough economic times, especially with the league embroiled in a global labor dispute that could prompt an owners' lockout in 2011. No doubt, Haden will be the last Browns' draft pick to sign. No matter how much time in camp he may miss, he's not going to hold up the team's development. Kicker Phil Dawson, who has been unhappy with his contract situation, elected not to boycott the mandatory minicamp in June, so it's doubtful he would do so at training camp -- where team fines can be greater. The absence of a quarterback "competition" should be a refreshing change.

Though CPAP is effective in treating obstructive sleep apnea, many patients have had a difficult time tolerating a mask and using the machine at night.

Recent developments support the concept. Scientists have discovered amino acids, for example, that don't taste salty on their own but when combined with salt make salt taste saltier. And at Senomyx, researchers have identified a protein that appears to be a central part of the sodium receptor and are busy searching through a library of more than 500,000 natural and artificial flavor candidates to find ones that might interact with that protein (called SNMX-29) and produce saltier sensations. Already, the company says it has found more than 250 candidates.

And, at this point, they just have to create the insurance if they've got to go the other route. But the prospect of bankruptcy makes the sale more complicated too."
This round of Corps letters is unrelated to the current flooding. But after the waters recede late this summer or early fall, there will be much debate about whether more such letters should go out, not just to help encourage wildlife redevelopment around the river, but to reduce future floods by reducing floodplain development.

It seems like every time Crowder opens his mouth on "Justified," something elegant comes out. Sure, someone else said it first, but for a criminal from Harlan County, Ken., this guy's plenty literate. A few weeks ago he was going all Saul Bellow on his rival Robert Quarles, and in this week's episode, he drops a beautiful line from Shakespeare's "The Tempest" into a conversation with Raylan Givens. They're talking about Quarles again, of course, and Givens wants some information about what the Detroit mafia's intentions are in Kentucky. Crowder says something about carpetbaggers, one of his big themes, and tells Givens that after the war (in the South there's only one war, the Civil one) it seemed like "hell is empty and all the devils are out."

As a violation of the Christian Witness Statement that all Catholic educators in the Archdiocese of St. Louis are obliged to uphold, we relieved this teacher of his duties."

Winsome is sure that some local species have gone extinct since Eisen described them. Earthworm conservation is not on the radar of most environmental groups. Readers of Amy Stewart's "The Earth Moved" will recall the giant earthworm of Oregon's Palouse Prairie, 2 feet long and lily-scented. Last year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rejected a petition to list the Palouse worm as endangered; too little was known about where the worms lived and what threats they faced.
-- Once an initiative has qualified for the ballot, give the Legislature a defined period to amend the initiative to fix obvious problems or to pass a bill that would satisfy the proponents' objectives and compel them to withdraw their ballot measure. This would address two of the biggest problems with the initiative process. One, a poorly drafted initiative cannot be altered after signature gathering - such as the 1996 campaign reform measure (Prop. 212) that inadvertently repealed a ban on gifts to legislators and other public officials. It was defeated. The other problem with initiatives is their inflexibility: Once passed, they cannot be changed when unintended consequences arise. Ten states allow this "indirect initiative" option, giving legislators one last chance to act before an all-or-nothing measure goes to the ballot.

This martial-, gangland-style of campaigning apparently makes the people in the campaigns feel hardheaded, professional and Machiavellian. But it's not clear that it's actually the best way to win an election. That's because the style is based on a series of dubious assumptions: that the harshest language is the most persuasive to voters; that what feels good to you as a competitive combatant will also look most attractive to detached onlookers; that over the duration of a six-month campaign, daily combat will continue to look compelling rather than cumulatively revolting; that in a campaign dominated by 'super PAC" negativity, a presidential candidate is better served by wading into the brawl rather than separating himself from it.
The Orlando Police Department does a lot of good work. And this newspaper often highlights it.
"The assault action that occurred was a criminal action that also constitutes family violence," he said. "Pilar Sanders was arrested for that and jailed."
Last year, the administration made an exemption for a small number of religious employers, such as churches, if contraception violates their religious tenets.

Authorities say the trafficker called Brady in December 2010 at the Westchester airport and told him that he had been placed into a secondary search because he was carrying $100,000 in cash. Within minutes, Brady arrived and tried to convince the searching TSA officer and his supervisor that the trafficker was a legitimate businessman and that any money on him was legitimate, prosecutors said.

Maybe his problem — okay, our problem, because we always wanted more — is that he does not fit a classic profile. He’s not a pure point, which he played for five years. He’s not a burner whose speed can turn around any matchup, and he doesn’t have the size for a two.
Strategic Air isn't asking the county for any money, Andreas emphasized. If the group issues tax-exempt bonds, it would enjoy an indirect subsidy from federal taxpayers, but Strategic Air alone would be on the hook to repay the bonds.

The company said it will give more precise bonus numbers toward the end of the month when it reports earnings for 2010.

I know, I know. This is just the way things are done in the NFL. The players grab for any leverage they can get. Reed is using his well-earned reputation as one of the greatest safeties in the history of the league to try and get the Ravens to pony up several more years at a heavy price. We know that because he is using Peyton Manning's giant new deal with the Broncos to bolster his argument.

QUESTION: Albert Pujols is set to make his spring training debut today for the Los Angeles Angels. What do you expect from Pujols this season?

The fact that job openings remained steady in February suggests March's disappointing job growth could be a temporary bump. It usually takes one to three months for employers to fill openings.
Can’t wait to see how The Associated Press spins the terror conviction in Brooklyn federal court yesterday. A Queens man and his friends went to Pakistan to join al Qaeda, and came home to commit jihad by blowing up the subways. It took the jury only a few hours to convict such a nice religious boy, which is probably what the AP believes he was before the evil NYPD spy crews turned him into a raging Islamist. Sweet.
Where do the beautiful people go in Cleveland? To this chic spot that recalls the Delano in Miami's South Beach. The mood is mod, not rustic, at this glass, metal and brick midcentury-modern gem -- unusual for a patio. But not for a creation of chef Marlin Kaplan, whose innovative small plates and cocktail menu (try a summery Bloom with fresh lavender) mix perfectly with the sophisticated-but-funky decor.

The cause of Murphy’s death "appears to be natural," said Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter.
We all know the Wings are interested in Ryan Suter, an extraordinarily talented 27-year-old defenseman who is eligible for unrestricted free agency July 1. The Predators would like to keep him, but they also want to keep their captain and Norris trophy finalist, Shea Weber, who will be a restricted free agent. They just extended goalie Pekka Rinne's contract for $49 million over seven years. They have a projected $32 million in salary-cap space for next season, but they only have 12 players signed. Up front, nine players are headed for some sort of free agency, and so are five on defense, including Suter and Weber.

The issue of cheating in school has become an explosive one nationally. Society seems to have arrived at a difficult crossroads: School kids -- including those with top grades -- not only cheat with great regularity, but they express trouble understanding what's the big fuss?

One look at Gianni's mother's caregiver and Alfonso can't believe Gianni isn't carrying on with her. Gianni's only response is the body language for "meh." His carrying-on days are over. But he begins to be persuaded by Alfonso that 60 is too young to retire completely from the chase. "The Salt of Life" tells his story in an affectionate, low-key way, not as a smutty sex-com, but as a gentle look at a harmless man who realizes he has become invisible, except to people who need something from him. His mother, for example, needs him to come over twice in the same day to adjust the TV set.

Detroit's North American International Auto Show often offers a glimpse into the auto industry's mindset. In 2009, for example, the show's atmposphere was grim with the main entertainment coming from betting pools on which companies would survive the year.

Our inability to judge our impairment is why a new Oregon law is more than welcome. House Bill 3075 requires first-time DUII offenders to install ignition interlock devices for roughly nine months if they want to enter a diversion program and avoid a DUII conviction. It costs them, not you, making this a rare tough-on-crime law, says Hunt, the House Democratic leader and one of the bill's co-sponsors. "We have spent so many debates on how to get to drunken drivers, and it is typically very reactive and very costly for taxpayers."
Bachmann enters the race as an Iowa poll shows her near the front of the pack in the first in the nation caucus state.
Both also stress the need to heal the partisan divide. Reske boasts a strong track record in that area, having garnered substantial Republican support in his election campaigns and in policymaking in the General Assembly and the Council of State Governments, of which he has been Midwest chairman. "Market the Midwest" is his slogan, and he'd be a good bet to back it up.
PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES
He said it appeared that Dennis and Schrock-Peterson created a "little processing plant" to make the drugs. Authorities believe Dennis ordered a controlled substance called AM-2201 from a seller and had the chemical shipped to his home. He allegedly mixed the substance with acetone and flavoring and sprayed it on an otherwise harmless herb to make synthetic marijuana. Schmidtknecht said it was being produced in six-gram packages. With average retail prices of $7 to $10 per gram, that puts the total haul of processed and unprocessed products at about $200,000, he said.
Christie also said he would consider what Frenchtown Councilman Gerry St. Onge called, "the real numbers," in the cost to close the facility. St. Onge told Christie that the transition team didn't consider that as the state's population ages, the need for psychiatric hospital care by the elderly suffering from dementia, Alzheimer's and other disorders is growing. Closing Hagedorn to save money now could be seen in the near future as having been a costly mistake.

Jobs comes off as a visionary who was also an unpredictable colleague and mercurial taskmaster. He dismissed brilliant ideas, such as permitting non-Apple apps on iPhones, as abruptly as bad ones — until he envisioned them in their perfected state. He loved Zen simplicity; it influenced Apple's aesthetic. He also adopted crackpot cultish beliefs, like his long-held faith that a fruity diet would prevent mucus buildup and body odor (without showering).
"This is a guy who could set out with a little bag of ground corn, a bottle of water in his hand and be gone all day. The day before he died, he did a six-hour run," said Chris McDougall, a friend and author of "Born to Run."

THE ARCHITECTURAL DESIGNER: Three years after her husband's death, Rockney pulled out a clipping she'd saved from HGNW of a Chris Robinson renovation.

Indigo and I sat at the table with Patrick and Amos Ole Tininah, a young Masai and the head naturalist at Basecamp.

Rouse also reasoned that, in order to succeed, a new city should be between two larger, fast-growing metropolitan areas, should be easily accessible to the interstate highway system, and that the land could not be prohibitively expensive to acquire. He knew that the eastern seaboard of the United States was a logical place to build, and that the area between Baltimore and Washington was an obvious candidate.
