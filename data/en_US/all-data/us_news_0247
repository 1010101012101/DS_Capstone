Is it natural for humans to be like Ivan Boesky, the arbitrageur who once pronounced that "greed is healthy," rather than like Mahatma Gandhi, who said, "Live simply, so others may simply live?"
Charles said, "He's actually a very sweet, real, gentle down to earth person in real life and wants the world to be a better place, believe it or not, and that's part of the reason that we do these movies — to show the hypocrisy, show the things that people should be questioning. We want to help people question those things."
Despite herself, she learns her way around — how to keep dry during the tropical rainstorms, to take shelter from the devastating midday heat and to appreciate the astonishing opera house: "Suddenly every insect in Manaus was forgotten.… The children with fans that waved the flies away from the baskets of fish were forgotten even as she knew she was not supposed to forget the children. She longed to forget them. She managed to forget the smells, the traffic, the sticky pools of blood. The doors sealed them in with the music and sealed the world out and suddenly it was clear that building an opera house was a basic act of human survival. It kept them from rotting in the unendurable heat. It saved their souls in ways those murdering Christian missionaries could never have envisioned."
Both Krueger and Kile move up after serving as assistants.

While at the University of Vermont, Pierce landed at the Sirloin Saloon, an upscale steakhouse, where he discovered wine. "We tasted Coppola Claret, probably a '94, with a New York steak," says Pierce. "I thought, 'Oh yeah, I get it now.' Little did I know that '94 was a great vintage - I've gone back and tasted the wine since, and I still think it's not a bad wine."
"When the swell is bigger, better surfers expect people there to know what they're doing — there's not a lot of tolerance of tourists going out and cutting people off," he says. "But the town is made by its surf breaks, and it's generally very tolerant. Giving lessons is very much a part of the culture."

Until now, the FAA has banned the widespread use of drones because of concerns that the unmanned planes cannot see other planes and could cause a crash. As a result, the FAA currently requires potential users to pass through a lengthy authorization process.
The legislation in Congress would change the law to allow states to use the jammers, and a vote in the U.S. Senate could come this fall.
"I thank the Justice Department for standing up for voting rights," said state Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Democrat from Houston, according to the Houston Chronicle. "Throughout the preclearance process, Texas consistently failed to produce information showing the law would not have a discriminatory impact on minority voters. The Voting Rights Act exists for this exact purpose: protecting the ability of all Americans to access the ballot box."
Every entrée comes with a seasonal fresh veggie medley and often an additional side dish. In Paul’s case, it was a terrific timbale of barley, tomatoes and yucca in a light sherry vinaigrette. Frank ordered his favorite — a skirt steak that came on a platter so big he called it his “cruise ship.” The 20-plus ounce steak ($20) was superb, robust in flavor, butchered so well there wasn’t an ounce of fat on it, tender and marinated in just the right touch of red wine. It also came with a sauté of jumbo shrimp, onions and tomatoes big enough to be its own dish. But wait, there’s more: He also got a good olive oil relish of red onions, peppers and cilantro. Now Frank can eat. I’ve seen him take on a lot of food in one sitting, but he gave up in the middle and took the rest home for a late-night snack. For anyone else, it would have made another meal.

Now, you watch the Phillies in a situation like the one they encountered Tuesday night and you aren't sure where they will choose to turn. Tie game, seventh inning, Cole Hamels pulled after 108 pitches, the final three innings in the hands of the bullpen. This time, the call went to Bastardo, and the lefty came through. Two fly outs and a strikeout, a fastball that sat 91-92. None of it was as impressive as the displays he produced with regularity last season, but at the very least you saw a little of that rhythmic swagger that once upon a time made you think the eighth inning was over before it started. Except that Tuesday night, it was the seventh inning, and that's kind of the point we're getting at.
Like Ireland, Portugal and Spain both are enduring bond-market speculation of a future default, and are slashing spending to cope with deficits far above the euro-zone limit of 3 percent of GDP. Only Ireland is simultaneously trying to fund a massive bank-bailout program that threatens to swamp its ability to pay its own bills.

The gobbler's dark feathers were in sharp contrast to its glowing white head. While the tom turkey may have owned the woods, it was a wary bird. From a long walk away, it kept stopping to peer our way, checking out our decoy. Cantrell's decoy was unique, looking more like a wild bird than most. It was an inexpensive plastic decoy the guides had covered with "Turkey Skin," a commercially made coat of real turkey feathers.

A tip from Saudi intelligence services led authorities in Dubai and Britain to uncover the al-Asiri-made the U.S.-bound parcel bombs sent from Yemen in 2010. Yemeni authorities have said they believe the tip came from an AQAP operative, Jabir al-Fayfi. Held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, before going through a Saudi militant rehab program, al-Fayfi may have been working as a double agent planted by Riyadh, Yemeni officials said.

Hitchcock said that he held off on going into specifics on the Kings until today. "If we would have brought stuff that L.A. did on Tuesday or Monday, I don't think it would have any impact," Hitchcock said. "I think the players would have forgotten it by then. So everything we did today or tomorrow will be in prep for L.A. and them specifically, but you have to time it properly so the players are willing to listen and learn. When it's too far away they just want to get the work in. Now it's the focus and the work and it's different."

We have a low-income housing tax credit program that sucks millions from the coffers annually. We have lawmakers each year trying to sneak special handouts into statutes. What we don't have is legislative leadership with enough willpower to push that plate back and say, "enough!"
The Port Authority said the airports generate 500,000 jobs and $62 billion in annual economic activity, and failure to accommodate the increased demand will cost the region 86,000 jobs that would have been created.
But it may be even more productive to directly confront, and attempt to address where possible, Pakistani concerns about certain aspects of the relationship between Islamabad and Kabul. To the extent that Pakistan's government worries about an India-friendly Afghan government that would create security concerns on its western borders, leading to a form of strategic encirclement of Pakistan by India as well as Indian allies, there are steps that Afghanistan, supported by Washington, can take. They will not suffice to eliminate all such Pakistani paranoias, but they can make a difference — and even incremental steps can help in this situation.

Larsson and Clarkson scored consecutive goals in the third period to rally the Devils past the Flyers and make up for the absence of Kovalchuk. The Devils played without their leading scorer from the regular season because of a lower body injury.
The NCAA opened a terrible box of troubles late this season by essentially announcing that as long as an athlete can’t be proven to have known that his father was shopping him around, the kid is in the clear. And so none of us should be surprised when this plausible deniability syndrome becomes all the rage this recruiting season.

CHOCOLATE + 'CHOCOLAT'
Miller notes that the degree of difficulty removes time as a factor at Sioux Passage. A spectacular run at Sioux Passage is nowhere near as fast as a run through Forest Park or Jefferson Barracks. Columbia Hickman's Nicole Mello was dominating in winning the girls race in 19 minutes 25 seconds Saturday. But Mello's winning time was nearly a minute and a half off the winning pace at the Forest Park Cross County Festival and barely would have earned a place in the top 20 at Forest Park.
"The large double doors are open. Either Lee or Walter usually waits to greet guests near the large pots of cymbidium orchids grown on the estate and which line the entrance hall. Inside, first-time visitors tend to stare wide-eyed at the 6,500-square-foot living room with its pale pink marble floors and soft green sofas … and walls of cinder-brown lava rock, backdrop for their collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings. In the vaulted center of the room, light pours in from a raised cupola on the dark green bronze of Rodin's ‘Eve.' Nearly six feet tall, the sculpture stands by a reflecting pool surrounded by hundreds of bromeliad plants."
King's hoop skills weren't good enough to make the active roster, but the coach kept him around for his business skills. Undaunted, King continued working out, shooting 500 three-pointers a day, keeping in shape.
But the big culprit is plastics.
“That's what I was looking to do,” he said. “Get behind a veteran like Matt Birk and really pick his brain.”
QB Eli Manning. I mentioned last week a successful pump fake against the Seahawks might convince him or the coaching staff to try the same thing against the Bills, considering it’s worked so well for him in the past. That’s exactly what happened on Sunday when he pumped toward WR Mario Manningham on the right side, drawing S Jarius Byrd that way and leaving WR Hakeem Nicks singled-up with CB Drayton Florence on the left side. The result was a 60-yard completion. (Phil Simms was convinced a few times Manning was actually looking for Manningham. I disagree. That was a designed/planned pump if I’ve ever seen one.) Manning later didn’t fully pump but flinched enough to get Florence to come off TE Jake Ballard for an easy 20-yard completion. Florence must have thought Ballard’s being lined up out wide was strictly a decoy. Nope.

The minute I poured a glass of this 2010 Lirac, the scent of dried wild herbs, ripe blackberries, olives and earth leapt out of the glass. It's so rich and intense, it comes on like a baby Châteauneuf. In fact, the Bréchet family that produces this Lirac, a blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache, is renowned for their Châteauneuf-du-Pape. The "Plateau des Chênes" Lirac is fresh and easy to drink now, though it would be fun to see what it would become with some aging.

Iran has ramped up its use of the clearinghouse by more than 50% this year compared to last year, after it advertised the clearinghouse to Iranian and Indian firms in early 2009 as a way to avoid having to use dollars for their transactions and thus "sidestep the U.S. banking system altogether."
Moe, from Fort Zumwalt West, said he had trouble sleeping on Thursday and Friday nights after the Cardinal wins.
A few weeks later, the performance was released as a charity single to raise funds for Gulf War soldiers and their families. The record was a hit, peaking at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Houston donated the proceeds to the American Red Cross Gulf Crisis Fund.
The Bulldogs went three-and-out on their next series, and the Warriors started from the Zumwalt South 43. Treadway gained 11 yards. Colby Vogt gained 15 on a run, and the Warriors moved back into field goal position. Gesell made a 37-yard field goal with 2:27 left in the half to give West a 6-0 lead.
"This is a great win, we needed this win," said Sloan. "It starts the season off right."
While the Arizona statute specifically prohibits the use of race as a consideration, there is a conflict in another area of the state law which mandates that officers enforce federal law to the fullest extent of the law. Under federal law, race would be a permissible factor, so enforcing the federal law to the fullest extent may have to involve racial profiling. Regardless of her race, given that the grandmother is nervous and speaking in Spanish, the officers may have reasonable suspicion that she is undocumented and arrest her if she is unable to provide proof of legal status.
A man told Patrolman Louis Hribik that he bought a bottle of Dewars scotch at Little Brothers Beverage Outlet and then parked at Walgreen’s and ran into the store briefly. When he returned to his vehicle, he saw that his seat was moved and things were strewn about the interior, but the only thing that was missing was the scotch.

The Company's inventories were $53.4 million at the end of the second quarter of 2011, up from $26.4 million at the end of the same period in 2010. The year-over-year increase in inventory reflects low inventory levels in the second quarter of 2010 due to supply constraints and a strategic decision in 2011 to enhance the availability of core products in order to address future at-once demand, the growth of the Company's wholesale distribution network and preparedness for its U.S. military business.
President Barack Obama lambasted the Paul Ryan budget as "thinly veiled social Darwinism" in a scorching budget speech last week. The charge displayed the same care as his contention that it would be unprecedented for the Supreme Court to overturn legislation passed by Congress -- in other words, another verbal temper tantrum substituting petulance for reason.
Featured in the documentary "Gasland," the Susquehanna County village of Dimock has been at the center of a fierce debate over drilling, in particular the process of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The process involves injecting a mixture of water and chemicals deep underground to free trapped natural gas so it can be brought to the surface.

Everybody is falling fast for Katy Perry, whose song "I Kissed a Girl" was just blocked from topping the iTunes Top 100 by those evil guys in Coldplay. Have you no heart, Chris Martin? This girl is sweet. Raised by pastor parents in Santa Barbara, she nearly became a Christian rock star as a teenager before coming to her senses, dying her hair black and defecting to the dark side of mainstream pop. Her first single, which was charmingly called "Ur So Gay," served as a kiss-off to an eyeliner wearing ex, and she will be spending her summer traveling the country with the sweaty, tattooed men of the Warped Tour. We spoke to the 23-year-old Perry shortly after she made a bizarre cameo on "The Young and the Restless." The Warped Tour takes place Saturday at Piers 30/32.
But as expected, the Redskins proved to be more aggressive in their pursuit -- and ended up with the better offer. With Stanford QB Andrew Luck expected to go No. 1 to Indianapolis, Washington will use the pick for Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III.

An animal ban is being phased in this year, market manager Jenn Ross said, because the market is already crowded, and pets were making the space uncomfortable. Market officials last week also cited health and safety issues.

The ranks are pretty thin these days. Everything has boomed.

A couple of road trips and online buying resulted in everything I needed to reupholster the chairs and couch. For the couch I found the gray fabric online and then stopped at the Goodwill Outlet in Milwaukie and walked out with an armful of burlap fabric (10 yards for $4). Just a few blocks away I bought dark blue denim jean fabric from the Mill End Store for the two chairs. Last stop, Reviva. They always have a great selection of coffee bean sacks. The upholsterer had picked up the chairs and couch; I dropped off the fabric and let him do his magic. (And, FYI, neither the burlap nor the coffee sacks are scratchy. I have covered many a chair with them, no problem.)

With the friendliness and courtesy, I would bracket the excellent English that is spoken here. The Easterner, when he first hears it, is likely to mistake it for the glib chatter of habitual salesmanship. I think that is because the language you hear here, even from the most casual garage mechanic, is too articulate to seem plausible. For one accustomed to the bray of Eastern Virginia, or the gargle of Second Avenue New York, or the grunts of the West Virginia foothills, or the wim, wigor, and witality of Southern Pennsylvania, it is hard to believe that the common man can express himself coherently, unless he has learned the trick somehow by rote. So that when the common man out here addresses you in easy grammar, completes his sentences, shows familiarity with good manners, and in addition gives you a pleasant smile, you are likely to resent it, and assume that he is parroting the radio, or the talkies, or else that he has been under the tutelage of a high-pressure salesman somewhere, and supplied with a suitable line of gab. In other words, even when you hear it you don't believe it; instead, you keep your ears open for the "authentic" talk of the region, uncorrupted by influences tending to neutralize its flavor.

Rather than conserve the economy, these regressives want to resurrect the classical economics of the 1920s -- the view that economic downturns are best addressed by doing nothing until the "rot" is purged out of the system (as Andrew Mellon, Herbert Hoover's Treasury secretary, so decorously put it).

It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I must tell you this: Iron Man, Hawkeye, the Black Widow, Captain America, the Incredible Hulk and Thor do not contribute music to this soundtrack, passing on the opportunity to redefine the concept of a supergroup. It does, however, feature the first new recording by Soundgarden in 15 years. And they had an album called "Superunknown." So that's cool. Other artists featured range from Bush to Buckcherry and Five Finger Death Punch.

Malkin said about half of PG&E's transmission lines date from before 1970, so the records search would at least be doubled in scope from the current 1,805 miles and would encompass 20,000 segments of pipeline. "That's a lot of individual segments," he said.
Faced with falling membership, Acacia's shareholders have considered selling the club's 160-acre property, a rare green swath in Lyndhurst, near the Beachwood Place and Legacy Village shopping centers.

With such foresight -- and with hindsight to see how bad decisions have caused others to run amok -- he can avoid a personal and professional train wreck.

Melting pot and magnet that L.A. is, some of our friends may not have local family and can't afford to return home for the holiday, others don't yet have roots and places to go.

About the Mavericks: Dallas has been one of the most consistent teams this season and is one of the hottest in the Western Conference right now, having won 20 of its last 24 games. Three of those losses were decided by one point. ... Dallas went 11-1 in February, averaging 108.9 points per game and shooting 50.4 percent from the field. ... But the Mavericks have revealed weaknesses lately, suffering three losses in their last five games. ... All have come against Western Conference playoff contenders — the Memphis Grizzlies, the New Orleans Hornets and, most recently, the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers beat the Mavericks 96-91 Saturday, moving within a half-game of second place in the West. ... The key number to beating the Mavericks is 100. They are 36-3 when they score at least 100 points, but are just 11-16 when they score less than 100. Dallas has failed to reach triple-digits in two of the last three games and lost both times. ... The Mavericks went 4-of-16 from three-point range against the Lakers in Saturday's loss. It snapped a streak of 35 consecutive games with at least six three-pointers made, which was the third-longest single-season streak in NBA history. ... Nowitzki, who ranks 10th in the NBA in scoring, had 25 points, 10 rebounds and six assists in the loss to the Lakers. It was his 11th double-double this season.
