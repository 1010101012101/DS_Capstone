James, who had a pretty clear indication that he would not be playing against Colorado unless something went horribly awry, decided that he didn't like what he saw from his teammates in warm-ups.

The paper's reviewer was careful to avoid calling the book a collection of love stories: "It's short fiction that raises all the messy questions surrounding affairs of the heart: Why him? Why her? Why now? Why not? Bloom's true mastery comes through her well-drawn characters who stumble through telling scenes as they fall in and out of love.

Europe uses a different—some industry officials say overly optimistic—set of calculations to estimate fuel efficiency (usually expressed as liters per 100 kilometers or grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer, instead of miles per gallon). European regulators also give more mileage credit for technology such as stop-start systems than the U.S. does. Counting grams of carbon dioxide emitted per kilometer is a different way of measuring gasoline consumption since the more gasoline or diesel fuel a vehicle consumes, the more carbon dioxide it will emit. U.S. regulators are starting to compare vehicles based on carbon-dioxide emissions.

Many scholars believe that the new manual will increase addiction rates. A study by Australian researchers found, for example, that about 60 percent more people would be considered addicted to alcohol under the new standards.

Many of those accidents are due to "inattentional blindness," in which people can, in effect, turn a blind eye to things they aren't focusing on. Images land on our retinas and are either boosted or played down in the visual cortex before being passed to the brain, just as the auditory cortex filters sounds, as shown in the Nature study last week. "It's a push-pull relationship—the more we focus on one thing, the less we can focus on others," says Diane M. Beck, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Illinois.

The proposed deal also is likely to increase government scrutiny on Google at a time when antitrust regulators in the U.S. and Europe already are parsing its business practices to determine whether it has been abusing its power to stifle competition. The inquiries are focused primarily on the company's Internet search and advertising businesses, but regulators are also looking into whether Google using Android to ensure its s services receive preferential treatment on devices using that free software.

For a president up for re-election, this will be a rare Asia trip devoted to just one country, built around a nuclear security summit that carries his imprint.

In New Jersey, we strive to provide better health care with less cost. President Obama’s plan does the reverse and cuts $3,700 worth of benefits for certain senior citizens, according to the Heritage Foundation, which estimated that lower-income earners and minorities would be hit hardest.That’s as responsible as sending up a hitter to face a 100 mph fastball without a helmet.Obamacare also places new taxes on health devices such as hearing aids, imaging machines, replacement hips and even the common tongue depressor. These costs will be passed on to consumers and have a chilling effect on the industry’s research and development budgets, meaning less innovation in this very important field. The billions of dollars’ worth of taxes added to insurers, prescriptions and medical devices will mean higher prices and fewer choices for patients. Some taxes will come right out of their pockets.

The most recent changes don't mean that data plans will always look this way, though. Some analysts suggest that carriers might eventually offer different speed tiers, perhaps charging more to always use a 4G network, or having customers start off using their 4G network and then switching to the slower 3G network after hitting a monthly data-usage allotment. T-Mobile's existing unlimited data plan flirts with this idea already.

Mr. Citerne said the bank didn't notice the unauthorized trading until last week because the trader had "intimate and malicious" knowledge of its procedures and knew at what dates checks were conducted. "Each time he took a position one way, he would enter a fictitious trade in the opposite direction to mask the real one," Mr. Citerne said.

The film itself can likewise be regarded as marginally clever. It employs the same conceit as its predecessor — that 21st century characters can rediscover the world within Jules Verne's novels, because the novels themselves were only disguised as fiction. This time, it's revealed that Robert Louis Stevenson and Jonathan Swift were playing the same game, allowing director Brad Peyton and the writers to combine Verne's “Mysterious Island” with a few minor elements from “Treasure Island” and “Gulliver's Travels.”

Haag's book "Marriage Confidential: The Post-Romantic Age of Workhouse Wives, Royal Children, Undersexed Spouses and Rebel Couples Who are Rewriting the Rules" sets out to put a face on the melancholy marriage and give examples of couples who are redefining marriage so it works better for them. About half the book challenges the notion of the importance of monogamy and rethinking its rules. Actually, it's not exactly a rewriting of rules but a revising of the time-honored hallmarks of ennui in marriage known as taking a mistress or lover.

I have a fantastic rescue dog, Haley, who lives with me and my family. I speak only Chinese to my parents and aunt in my household. Haley must know Chinese too. When she meets dogs at the dog park or the street, she can become scared or aggressive. I have to stay right with her and try to keep her under control because she barks, growls or wants to hide behind me. But if the dogs are also from Chinese-speaking homes (and I ask), my dog is relaxed. She plays, sniffs freely, and runs around. Does this make sense? -- Wen

It is difficult by order of magnitude. It's very hard to enforce copyright without violating other kinds of rights, especially privacy. But I don't think it's impossible. And it's interesting to notice that most of the people who argue that it's impossible are gaining a lot from piracy in one way or another. Public Knowledge, which is a public advocacy group in D.C. that gets some money from Google, will talk about how any kind of copyright enforcement risks people keeping track of what you're doing online. But I'm not worried about the data NBC Universal has about me. I'm much more worried about the amount of data Facebook has about me. People don't seem to be worried about that.

It's simply dazzling. At night, the golden stupa is lighted, giving the otherwise colorless city a beautiful focal point.

More startling than the writing of this law around Gonzales is the political reality that made such surgery necessary: Bush's refusal to remove Gonzales. A president who happily dispatched Paul O'Neill and unhappily axed Donald Rumsfeld clings to his Texas crony even at the cost of changes in his battle plan for the "war on terror."

Although he wrote almost to the end (and he's published posthumously at a rate rivaled only by L. Ron Hubbard and Jack Kerouac), he had produced most of his important work by 1940, when "For Whom the Bell Tolls" appeared.

Coach Meyer choosing to go to Ohio State when the job opened up is about as natural a decision as it ever gets in the college football coaching world.

An environment in which a Nebraska woman reportedly had to deliver a baby knowing it would die minutes later, because doctors feared prosecution under the 20-week abortion ban.

With the shoeshine kits and "Aqua Trolls" (a lawn ornament that Friedman, upon joining the company in 2001, first took for Santa Claus; "now I'm half-Jewish, but I know Santa Claus") a distant memory, he now envisions Restoration as a kind of "open platform," an app store for home decor, where the likes of London furniture maker and antiques dealer Timothy Oulton and the Midwestern/Dutch pair of Mark Sage and Rudi Nijssen can craft new pieces out of old things, artisanal objects pitched somewhere between mall sameness and Design Center uniqueness. When I ask him what's left from the "old" Restoration Hardware, he stops to think. "There's a leather chair," he says, pausing as if searching for the right word, "that's evolved."

The details: Aromatic bitters are the shortstops of the cocktail world - indispensable but left until the very end of the conversation. Brad Thomas Parsons changes that with "Bitters: A Spirited History of a Classic Cure-All" ($24.99, Ten Speed Press, 232 pages). It includes the particulars of why bitters exist - first as a medicinal aid, then as an aromatic one - then spends ample space offering recipes on making your own bitters (that alone should keep hobbyists occupied for months) and, of course, the requisite drink recipes. It is a specific topic, but one that lies at the heart of great bartending. Now Parsons has given it proper respect.

Chile prepared for the shift by building up a budget surplus, and it has still had to borrow a sizable amount to cover the shortfall in revenue in the public pension system.

And then there are those sodas. One-fourth of American teens drink an average of four sodas a day, which is the equivalent of an entire extra meal in terms of calories. Sodas, as well as energy drinks and flavored water, have no nutritional value and are often loaded with sugar.

Sounds great, except that juice isn't anywhere near as healthy as it's cracked up to be because it contains a lot of sugar and the most healthful part of the fruit itself - the fiber - has been filtered out.

Just think of what she's asked to do—keep us constantly connected to a seethingly angry, chain-smoking, kick-boxing, foul-mouthed, bisexual Goth hacker with a history of violence that she frequently and ferociously updates.
