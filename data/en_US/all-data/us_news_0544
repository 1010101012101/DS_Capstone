Short takes: Michigan's GOP Gov. Rick Snyder, a successful entrepreneur and venture capitalist who was elected last year in his first try for public office, has warned legislative Republicans against passing restrictive anti-immigrant laws of the kind that have been popping up in other states. Snyder says Michigan needs to welcome immigrant talent, not scare it away. . . .

One of the founders of the 1970s Cuban “nueva trova” movement, a genre that combined fervent revolutionary lyrics and Cuban balladry with North American folk-rock and jazz, Rodríguez is frequently compared to Bob Dylan. His voice is often frail in the high registers, and he is sometimes appreciated more for his poetic lyrics than his compositional style. But Rodríguez, who is also strongly influenced by the Beatles, is perhaps best described as a cinematic chronicler of Cuba’s revolutionary experiment.

Dear J.B.: The effect of these so-called high/low collaborations on the brand is to extend its audience to customers who may not be able to afford their four-figure designs but can afford their perfumes, watches, scarves, costume jewelry, etc. The surprise has been that the luxury customer not only is not bothered by the fast-fashion offerings, she is also buying the cheaper clothes. Prestige and masstige (the word for mass-market merchandise) are no longer antithetical. The late, great Halston lost many of his prime retail accounts when he did a collection for J.C. Penney.

Do I think Crabtree will slide toward No. 10? No. But it's possible. If he gets past the Seahawks and the reports about the Browns passing on him are accurate, he could be staring the Raiders in the face at No. 7. You hear the rumblings that Oakland loves its speed receivers, so maybe they take Maclin or Heyward-Bey. Now, you've got the Jags (who just signed Torry Holt and have other needs) and the Packers (who don't need a receiver) before the 49ers, who could use a big-time receiver. Again, likely? No, but I'm seeing a run on the offensive tackles in the top 10, so I wouldn't call it impossible. (Sounds like what I've been telling you about the Edwards trade, huh?)

They also have chicken falafel, beef gyro and curried chicken sandwiches for $7, or smaller falafel sandwiches called F-bombs for $3.50. A side of baked naan chips was $2. Should have skipped them and bought another delicious watermelon-basil lemonade ($2.50).
The most jarring and controversial aspect of the league report was that bounties were paid for "cart-offs" (players being carried off the field) and "knockouts" (players unable to return to the game).

It did not work out the way everyone at OSU hoped, and now the remnants of the class are left to try to establish a legacy that will include something besides regret and recriminations.

For me, it was a personal journey as well as a vacation. My family left China in 1949, first for Taiwan and then the Philippines. I'm Chinese, but I act like a foreigner culturally. Despite this, I was surprised at how much I felt at home in China, and I felt proud of the country's economic development. This, I felt, was the future for our people.

All of the participants who lose weight learned one valuable lesson, Barczykowski said.
Soprano Nanette Canfield brilliantly captured the essence of Chinese opera with "As in a Dream," a set of two songs based on ancient poems about nature and love.
The lamentable fact was that no one had come from the base, nor would the Army do anything to help this broken young woman. Masked gunmen had attacked the minivan she was traveling in because it ferried her and others to jobs at the U.S. camp. The assassins had stalked the vehicle from the base, a frequent scenario in the Iraqi killing grounds. She and her fellow commuters were the latest victims of a grisly but effective guerrilla strategy: eliminate any Iraqi who was "collaborating" with U.S. forces, even if their role was no more significant than serving beverages in a base cafe or cleaning the floors.
After Danny Chastain was hit by a pitch with one out, Devers drew a walk and clean-up hitter Mike Ehrhard smashed a two-run double to left-center.

"Who's to say? Put it this way: If it's legal, and I'm hitting 20 homers, and my agent says, 'Don't you have 10 more homers in you? Try this … .' If it's going to jump you from $2 million to $10 million a year, and if it's legal, or not banned, I'd consider it."

Faried started getting big minutes in mid-February. His instant impact gave Denver the luxury to trade Nene, the big-money big man who at times was playing uninspired basketball. While Nuggets coaches weren't sure what they had with Faried, they knew they would get everything he had.
Most London guidebooks have ignored the East End, their maps extending no farther than the Tower of London. But ever since the announcement that venues for the 2012 Summer Olympics would be built in the city's eastern suburbs, the guidebook maps - and the buzz - have been expanding.

"Autopsy findings only infrequently explain why an individual lost control of a vehicle in a car crash," ME Thomas Gilson said.
“He really hurt us last time, and we also realized that he wasn’t much a dodger in their game plan. He was more of a finisher,” Marr said. “So we thought if we could take away opportunities from him with the short stick in his face all day, we could kind of frustrate him a little bit and not get him the ball. And then we took strengths away from some of the other midfielders and made them go to their weak hand. It was a great strategy by Liam Gleason, our defensive coordinator, and it worked great.”
"We entered into that (agreement) with good faith," said Eaton, a professor of labor studies and employment relations. "They understood that this coming year was going to be worse."

Eighteen travelers received reimbursement checks totaling more than $10,000 after banging up their vehicles on state-maintained lanes in Cuyahoga, Geauga and Lake counties, according to information provided by the District 12 office of the Ohio Department of Transportation. The largest payout covered a $1,051.76 tab.
About 150 Ponzi schemes -- the most common type of investment fraud -- collapsed in the year after the Bernie Madoff scheme broke. That's four times the pre-Madoff collapse rate. The SEC issued 82 percent more cease-and-desist orders against alleged Ponzi and similar schemes in the first year post-Madoff. So, post-Madoff, there's certainly stepped-up awareness and reporting of Ponzis, and that's a good thing. In general, today's economic conditions -- low interest rates and all -- favor Ponzi schemers. In a Ponzi scheme, the scammers usually promise unachievable rates of return to lure investors, then use money deposited by later investors to pay supposed profits to earlier investors.

Yet, just as Hillary Rodham Clinton's primary triumphs in 2008 led her supporters to clamor for her as Barack Obama's vice presidential running mate, so too may there be a case for Santorum on a Romney ticket, if the former Massachusetts governor wins the nomination. The case for Santorum could be especially strong if he is perceived as a candidate able to unite the party base and drive up Republican voter turnout.
Brown, a Democrat who ran an unsuccessfully for Assembly last year, says he’s a Navy Seal who served in Iraq. As he testified before the Rutgers Board of Governors last month, he argued the Christie-sanctioned plan to rebrand the South Jersey campus under the Rowan name would rob students of opportunities afforded by Rutgers’ reputation. The Republican governor began to explain that current students would still graduate with degrees from Rutgers.

“As I look back on my two years, I’m not happy with the second year,” said Ream, whose play slipped last season after a sterling rookie season. “I loved my time in New York. All the people in the organization, the players and coaching staff, I’ve enjoyed every minute of it. The fans were always behind us 100 percent, and I’ll always remember that and it’s something I’ll miss.”
She replaces Richard Herman, who resigned in late 2009 in the wake of an admissions scandal, in which well-connected applicants were given preferential treatment.
It was a devastating loss for the Nuggets, who led at the half and were in the game to the end but could not get a bucket when they needed it most late. And, it was a heartbreaker for the Pepsi Center crowd, which was riled up all night. It was an eerie evening. L.A. had a huge following of its own fans, a couple of fights broke out and, pecularily, a woman wandered onto the court in the first half (she was detained by police and escorted out of the arena).
Kiley, 73, of Minneapolis, had produced his radio program out of a home Cook owned in Burnsville. He invited listeners to call him to learn how they could protect their money. Hundreds did, and he spent hours with them on the phone, telling them that he was a senior economist and a financial adviser to the family that owned the Kroger stores as well as engendering sympathy by falsely telling some investors that his wife had been killed in an accident involving a drunken driver.

The low-lying areas near Edwards Road and Old Bloomfield Avenue were among the first to be evacuated, he said.
We are halfway to a real solution. Make the reduction permanent, extend it to the employers’ tax, and remove the $106,800 cap. This is a sorely needed middle-class tax break, but it unnecessarily comes at the expense of the retirees and people with disabilities, unless the above changes are made. The Republicans will decry them, because it raises taxes on the wealthy. But it also caters to their desire to cut taxes, because it will reduce business taxes, which is likelier to spur an economic recovery than continued tax breaks for the wealthy.

If I actually commit to this -- and I'm not saying I will -- I'd probably have to speak my tweets and Facebook updates aloud all day to keep from getting the shakes. But if I do disconnect for a day, at least I'll be up and running again in time to use my Bible app and tweet at church on Sunday.

First and foremost, Oregon must win its next three games to have any shot at returning to the national championship game.

According to the study, based on government data, the average earnings of Californians ages 35 to 49 grew by 17 percent in the 10 years leading up to 2007. That corresponds closely to the national average. But when it comes to "relative upward mobility" - the percentage of those in the bottom-half income brackets whose earnings increased significantly over the 10-year period - California, with 37 percent, is considerably higher than the national average, said the Pew researchers.

As of the end of 2011, Americans Elect had raised $22 million — chiefly from donations of $100,00 or more that came from just 55 individuals — to gain ballot access for its candidate to be in the 50 states. (It's already secured that status in California.) We don't know whom most of those individuals are because Americans Elect claims the status of a social welfare organization, not a party, and as such is not obliged to list its funders. We do know that its website has a "leadership" list of roughly 100 people, and that of the 90 or so who aren't the organization's staffers or consultants, 20 are heads or leading executives of hedge funds, private equity firms and major banks. If Americans Elect is spearheading a revolution, it's a revolution of the 1%.

And with Supreme Court rulings like Citizens United in 2010 – and perhaps the upcoming decisions on Obamacare and the federal government's lawsuit against Arizona's illegal-immigration law – hinging on the opinion of a single justice and setting longstanding precedents, the court's balance ought to be top of mind for voters this year.

If a for-profit business hopes to maintain the 2 or 3 cents in profit per dollar spent, they have to make a series of difficult choices. Sometimes they'll cut labor costs by introducing self-service (why do you think you pour your own soda nowadays?); other times, they'll decrease customer services (a waiter might work five tables instead of four, allowing the restaurant to shed one or two servers per shift). Either way, it means fewer jobs.

For all their appeal, chacareros aren't considered a formal meal. And with his clientele largely Chilean, Aguilera noticed that it was the daily specials from cook Rosamel Salas' own repertoire that were flying out the door. A new menu permanently lists many of her prized dishes, such as pollo arvejado, braised chicken flecked with bright green peas swimming in viscous chickeny juices. Her porotos granados, a savory corn and baby lima stew topped with a chunk of fork-tender braised beef completely satisfies the soul.
Quarterback Sam Bradford is learning his third offense in three NFL seasons - from his third coordinator, no less. But at first blush, the transition may be easier than expected.
Maria Menounos danced an elegant but playful foxtrot with Derek Hough as Reeves, 70, belted out "Jimmy Mack." Oops -- Maria lost her footing at one point, slipping on the stairs just enough to put them out of sync. But it didn't seem to matter much. Bruno said the dance combined "wit" and "elegance." Carrie Ann said it was "excellent" but said Maria's shoulders came up. Len said Maria was "a joy to my eyes" while Martha Reeves was "a joy to my ears." Scores: 8, 9, 9 = 26 + 4 = 30.

Brady avoids such questions. He and Belichick were seeking their own special shot at history. Win and they would have joined the Steelers' Chuck Noll and Terry Bradshaw as the only coach-quarterback combination with four Super Bowl titles.
This, says the Ohio Democratic Party, is yet one more misstep in the political life of Mandel, who by now is an actual candidate for Senate in 2012, challenging incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown. If you see it as little more than a bookkeeping matter, the Democrats have a rejoinder: There are federal laws that say candidates for federal office — and politicians contemplating federal office — should follow federal fund-raising and expenditure rules. Among those rules is one that essentially says a politician who tapped donors to elect him to the state treasurer's office can't then reach into his state account surpluses to vault him to a seat in Congress.
Nearly 54 million retirees, disabled workers, surviving spouses and children now get Social Security. Payments for retired workers average $1,020 a month; disability benefits average $929 a month. In 75 years, 122 million people, or one-fourth of the population, will be drawing benefits.

I've covered human rights stories in Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America. Journalists may tell themselves that survivors always find it healing to bare their souls. But people have had flashbacks after being interviewed about their traumas. Still, seven survivors who had been with Esad during his year in the camps agreed to answer my questions, though some had not discussed their confinement in more than a decade.

The pancake batter took minutes to make. It was so flavor-packed (garlic, sesame oil, ginger, cilantro, Sriracha) that no sauce accompaniment is necessary, though I serve them with more of that hot chili sauce on the side because I'm a sucker for the stuff.
One hundred years ago Friday in Philadelphia, William Howard Taft stood on a stage above the bronze eagle statue inside the Wanamaker Building and dedicated the city's first modern department store.

Maybe they could copy the new iPad's features. But Apple's new hardware is secondary to the world the company created around it. They created a development environment in which an app like Paper is technically possible. Even more improbably, Apple fostered a developer and a user community in which Paper is held up as a desirable goal of beauty and simplicity, instead of being derided for not having as many abilities as most of its competitors. The lack of buttons is actually its signature feature.

Alleyne is in her second year at Summit High School after spending her first two years at Ayala High School in Chino Hills, Calif. In 2010 as a sophomore at Ayala, Alleyne helped the Bulldogs to a 22-9 record, and Sierra League championship with an undefeated mark of 10-0. Alleyne averaged a double-double of 13.2 points and 15.3 rebounds per game, and was named to the CIF Southern Section Division 1A First Team. She earned second team honors as a freshman in 2009. Ayala High School is also the former home of current Oregon senior Jasmin Holliday.

Over time, it has deepened, offering solace during the loss of a marriage and the death of a parent, when Earth and sky seemed to offer life's only certainties. It's provided moments of wonder, when awakened by howler monkeys in a dense Guatemalan jungle. And bliss, when dozing off in a tent cabin to the lapping of gentle Caribbean waves.
The Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS) projects 582,000 new nursing jobs will be added between 2008 and 2018, the highest numerical increase of all occupations. That puts potential employees -- and contractors -- in a strong position to bargain salary or hourly pay.

As 2011 winds down, the crusade for dirtier air - fueled by the oil, chemical, coal and power industries and carried out by their surrogates in Congress - is cranking up. Ignoring the hysterical hype may prove difficult, but surely it is good advice.
The production of Etherly, who leads the team with 13.5 points per game, is usually a good indication of the team’s fortune. In Loyola’s eight losses, Etherly averaged 10.5 points, with only a 17-point performance in the Feb. 13 loss to Fairfield as the exception. In Loyola’s 24 wins, the 6-foot-7 Etherly averaged 14.5 points and went over the 15-point mark in 10 games. When he’s on -- as he was in a 27-point, 10-rebound win over UMBC, his beast-mode 22-point showing in the home win over Iona, or his back-to-back 21-point games in MAAC tournament wins over Niagara and Siena -- he’s Loyola’s go-to option, and a good one at that.

If you plan to live there long-term, consider options ranging from reducing your rate to changing your loan term -- to cut it back from a 30-year to a 15-year mortgage, for example.

So the pace may slow, as the team turns more of its attention to the draft, but the Rams still need to add bodies in the second phase of free agency. They can't fill every need in the draft.

One, Prior Walter (Rob Lindley), is 30 years old and an occasional drag queen, whose roots stretch back to medieval England and the Mayflower. His secular Jewish boyfriend, Louis Ironson (Eddie Bennett), brainy and underachieving, is unable to deal with the mess of Prior's disease, and abandons him at the very moment he is needed most. His former lover, Belize (Michael Pogue), a black drag queen and registered nurse, steps in to help.

The straight promissory-note scheme is probably the simplest. The investor lends his savings to the schemer, who promises to repay at a highly attractive interest rate.

øReal accuracy in aerial bombing came towards the end of the Vietnam War, in cases such as the 1972 destruction of North Vietnam's Thanh Hoa Bridge with laser-guided bombs, after conventional bombs had failed for years. The maturation and miniaturization of electronics, computers, lasers and other communications technologies springing from that time, all add up to today's "precision" munitions, Crouch says. The result is the current era of drone plane bombing, and the precise targeting that saw fighter planes, launched in Italy, target Gadhafi's motorcade. "Hitting a target is not so much the problem now, as making sure it is a real target," says Crouch, noting controversy over civilian bombings in the ongoing war in Afghanistan. "How could Gadhafi stand up to that kind of air power, really, in the end?" he says.

It's not a puzzle you can solve. That's why you keep coming back. Just like the steelhead that keeps coming back up the river, against the current, so he can spawn and go back into the ocean, and then a few years later, come back up the river to spawn again - and again.

For much of its 96-minute running time, "Sin Nombre" ("Nameless") functions as a road movie -- a railroad movie. Freight trains carry unauthorized loads of human cargo -- scores of impoverished immigrants perched precariously atop the cars -- as they lumber through Mexico. The riders share a single purpose, to make their way ever northward, then try to cross into the United States. The images are stunning -- there's a sense of whole populations on the move -- and all the more so for being shot, by Adriano Goldman, in 35mm color. (The use of film cameras instead of digital equipment was a crucial aesthetic choice that contrasts grinding squalor with graphic grandeur.)

Maryland began using M-Tag electronic tolling in 1999 and rebranded it as E-ZPass in 2001.

But a close look at the U.S. solar industry suggests that the tariffs may actually be a job killer because the vast majority of positions in the sector aren't on the assembly line.

We could have had at least one position with some sort of consistency instead of the disaster that ensued. Why is there no criticism for another wasted year? First Mangini and now possibly Hillis.

The museum winds up its story by showing the decline of the mob's influence in Las Vegas. Law enforcement was part of the story, putting more names into the "Black Book," which barred known criminals from involvement with casinos. But more important was the diluting effect of the casino buying spree of billionaire Howard Hughes, who arrived in Las Vegas in 1966 and spent much of the rest of his life in a penthouse at the Desert Inn. Wall Street stepped in after the Corporate Gaming Act of 1969 allowed corporations to own casinos. Slowly, the "families" were replaced by the "companies." Meanwhile, organized crime has gone international, as illustrated by a world map covered with hypodermic needles, knives, gambling slips and other criminal ephemera.
The theory remains controversial. It alarms liberal critics who say it ignores the root causes of crime — factors such as poverty, racism and lack of economic opportunity. Other critics argue that broken windows strategies have not worked or unfairly target some populations. "A disproportionate number of minorities have been arrested, and police misconduct complaints have increased as stops, frisks and arrests for minor crimes have multiplied," Bernard E. Harcourt wrote in his 2003 book "Illusion of Order."

Hirsch, who says he was bullied growing up, focuses most of his attention on Alex, and it's a smart decision. We watch in horror as the harassment on a bus intensifies to the point that Hirsch -- fearing for Alex's safety -- shows the footage of the abuse to educators and his family. Alex's parents are stunned by what they see.

There isn't a lot of scientific study on barefoot training. Research has shown that wearing shoes to exercise takes more energy, and that barefoot runners use about 4% less oxygen than shod runners. Other studies suggest barefoot athletes naturally compensate for the lack of cushioning and land more softly than runners in shoes, putting less shock and strain on the rest of the body. Barefoot runners also tend to land in the middle of their foot, which can improve running form and reduce injury.
Others were watching the drone video, as well. In addition to the pilot, the military crew at Creech consisted of a camera operator, mission intelligence coordinator and a safety observer. A transcript shows they believed the convoy contained insurgents.
"I know very little about . . . ," Gonzalez said, waving his hand to indicate the entire Phoenix metro region that lies to the east of his El Mirage farmland.

Writing, I think, is THE most forceful act of hope in destruction. We write to destroy and clear-cut. A good poem is the softest hurricane. We're all up in our tiny rooms, hoping the gods will blow the roof off, are we not?
Hannah (Rachel Hendrix) is a college freshman about to take the stage in her first-ever dramatic production. She's nervous, but clearly there is something else going on.

"Rethinking the War on Drugs" by Mark A.R. Kleiman, Jonathan P. Caulkins and Angela Hawken (Review, April 21) misleads readers into thinking that there are programs that will finally make headway into the drug problem. Can cities really afford to hire enough breathalyzer and drug-test monitors to check drug users twice a day? And will "swift and certain sanctions" do anything more than displace drug markets like a Whac-A-Mole game, or fill jails and prisons with nonviolent users?
Before Monday's sentencing, Haydon faced a year in prison but neither the prosecution nor judge said that would be a consideration because of her age.

The entire book is told in the third person, but as most thrillers do, "The Trinity Six" dips into multiple perspectives. There are some jarring moments when the switch occurs at the paragraph level -- not only is that a poor writing technique but it leads to plot messiness. For example, Gaddis suspects one of the book's major twists, but instead of leaving readers wondering along with Gaddis, as Cumming easily could -- and should -- have, the reader learns which way the twist turns 10 pages sooner than does Gaddis, when the head of British intelligence confirms it in his section.
We have a small situation in the world of professional athletics, and the small situation brings up larger questions of responsibility and duty. The most basic question is this: Do professional sports teams have an obligation to try to win games?
As voiced by the irrepressible Hank Azaria, Sven is this film's most inspired creation. He's a self-help guru who actually believes himself when he says things like, "If you want it, you must will it. If you will it, it will be yours." But as entertaining as Sven is, the film's plot hasn't come up with a character arc for him that is effective all the way through to the end.

If this is how congressional Republicans think they're going to win the November elections, they might want to check their approval ratings. Americans are thoroughly sick of a Congress that would rather play political games than solve our country's problems.
"Our feeling on merit pay is, teaching is a collaborative effort," Hiltner said. "This helps people in schools work together, instead of pitting teachers against each other because they are vying for a bonus."
øOpponents countered that the proposal would saddle Kentucky with a competitive disadvantage that would drive away trainers and horses. They warned no other state would follow Kentucky's lead in imposing a race-day ban on furosemide. It would take just one subpar performance by a thoroughbred running without race-day Lasix to prompt the trainer to move the horse elsewhere, they said.

We often entertain clients together. We especially like XO Steakhouse downtown and Grotto on Shaker Square. If we stay home, we love to make a fire in the fire pit on our patio and invite friends over for drinks. There is something very communal about sitting around the fire.
Under the direction of Martin Friedman, the three principal actors, although good individually, don't display the crisp ensemble timing required. Robert Hawkes as Smith is best when growling out threats but less interesting when he's immersed in his greedy scheme. Anne McEvoy's sniffling Bernstein is pathetic and adorable. And Andrew Narten is elegantly amoral as the lawyer, although one wishes his part were written with more heft.
One constant for River Hill has been defense, led by senior linebackers Riley Davis, Emmett Brew, Ryan Higgins, and linemen Alec Rau and Jason Johnson. The Hawks have allowed only 80 points this season (7.3 per game), and since the loss to Hammond, they've outscored opponents 278-33 with four shutouts.

I ended up giving 57 clothing items, or about two-thirds of what was in my closet (most of which I didn't wear anyway) to my local Goodwill. I spent $710 purchasing six tops, four pairs of shoes, three leather jackets, two fabric jackets, two sweaters, one skirt and one dress, which are now in heavy rotation. I spent an additional $1,240 on two of the most expensive clothing items I've ever purchased in my life - the designer handbag and leather vest - and $40 more on a pair of white skinny jeans from Zara since I couldn't find them used.

"We just went about our business," he said. "I had more compliments. The guys that were there and heard it and saw it, I think they were very appreciative of us being there. I wasn't going to say anything because we appreciate being there. We want to come back there. What am I going to do, call him out? Go, 'Hey, if you don't like it, get the hell out' or whatever? I'm in their house."

The group advocating for ending the one-child policy thought the change "would be a simple matter," said Gu Baochang, a professor of demography at Renmin University in Beijing, former adviser to the Family Planning Commission and informal leader of the advocacy group. Changing the policy, he says, is "so necessary demographically, and so wise politically. But resistance was so strong—much stronger than we had thought."

Not since 2002 has Federer gone an entire season without winning a Grand Slam. Outside of Wimbledon, Flushing Meadows has been Federer’s favorite spot, and he’s won 56 of 62 matches there. He won five consecutive U.S. Open titles from 2004 through ’08 before losing to Juan Martin del Potro two years ago in the final and Djokovic in last year’s semifinals. He has reached at least the quarterfinals at 29 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments.

Chris Korman, reporter: We won't know why the Ravens moved back until we see who they pick (unless they opt to tell us in the press conference we're heading to any minute), but they obviously favored Alabama's Dont'a Hightower over Courtney Upshaw. It also seems they would have liked Wisconsin guard Kevin Zeitler, but weren't sold on drafting Badgers center/guard Peter Konz this early. They've got nine picks now and feel there must be value in the middle rounds. It still seems like their first pick will be used on an offensive lineman, linebacker or possibly wide receiver. They'll be able to bring in more young depth now, which is good given their salary cap situation.

We also got our first taste of the Cotswolds' many joys — well-tended fields of bright-yellow rapeseed, newborn lambs frolicking in verdant pastures, abundant bird life, hardwood forests carpeted with bluebells and vistas that seemed to stretch forever.

In the steeplechase, she felt like the cap was off. It was a near-perfect event for her - a race that required speed, endurance, athleticism and, best of all, grit. The hurdles that steeplechasers sail over on the first lap of the 3,000-meter (1.86-mile) races grow more daunting each time around the track.
Now, of course, modest houses cost a million dollars, and there are two French restaurants in a single block on 18th Street.

Child-welfare workers conduct the initial investigations, but they send 70 percent of all child-abuse and neglect reports down the social-work track. Child safety has improved since Minnesota implemented the program, Sutton said, and the number of foster children plummeted by nearly 40 percent.
Which brings us back to "Pumped Up Kicks." Frontman Mark Foster tries to have it both ways: He's interested in telling a tale about a troubled kid, but college rock conventions prohibit anything as forthright as storytelling. So he tortures his verse with an effect that makes it sound like he's singing through a walkie-talkie. There's something to be said for this strategy. It creates intrigue, and makes the listener lean in and pay closer attention. If the melody is catchy enough -- and "Pumped Up Kicks" is plenty catchy -- it virtually guarantees that the song will reward repeated listens.
Yet in the clutch, his much-praised ability to incorporate his teammates in the offense has become deferential and downright abdication in the last two postseasons. The plays when a crown is at stake become his uncrowning moments.

Archimedes' legacy extends to mathematical fields as diverse as calculus and computer science. He made groundbreaking discoveries in hydrostatics, which measures the pressure exerted by liquids because of gravity. He invented the catapult, the battering ram, pulleys and siege machines.

Near a "breakdown" area where textile artists powder clothes with chocolate-cake mix and cornstarch to create a weathered look, five pattern makers and seamstresses work full time, surrounded by racks of costumes for orphans and prostitutes. Much of their time is devoted to dressing the character Elizabeth Haverford (Anastasia Griffith), a headstrong British socialite. For a crucial ballroom scene, they spent 150 hours constructing a white gown that required hand-cut patterns, three layers of skirts and 500 beads sewn into its rosettes to catch the light. Including labor and 20 yards of tulle, the dress cost about $3,800.

Colston, a seventh-round pick out of Hofstra in 2006, has had a tremendous run in New Orleans, posting 1,000-yard seasons in five of his six years. But he wants a big contract to stay, and the Saints are also going to have the break the bank on quarterback Drew Brees and possibly try to keep their other productive wideout, Robert Meachem. Colston has great height and would provide a good target for a shorter quarterback such as Colt McCoy or Robert Griffin III.
