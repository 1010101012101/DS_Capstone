He said at recent naming ceremonies he'd at first thought "The Ronald M. George State Office Complex" referred to a mental disorder. Research revealed there was none such, so he decided to be grateful that the designating plaque and signage "was not sprayed on as graffiti"; that money came from the governor's Department of General Services rather than the judicial budget; that the state of California owns the complex, rather than investors "from foreign venues such as Mumbai, Dubai ... and even Texas"; and most of all, that he was receiving "this honor pre-mortem rather than postmortem."

øSince Facebook has an age gate of 13, and Google+ has only just opened their social halls to teens ages 13 and up, only teenagers can play this game on the social networks. This strategy game is actually great for kids as young as age 8; but they will need to play it as an app.

The Mortgage Bankers Association calls for rates to rise to 5.8% by year end, a level unseen since November 2008.

But it was Miss Marple who became the most vivid symbol of Christie's worldview. With her white hair, cornflower blue eyes and gentle ways, Miss Marple took a lively interest in the world around her but knew from experience, alas, that pretty much everyone was capable of just about anything, including murder. People can be wonderful creatures, my dear, she would inevitably say in one form or another, but still it pays to keep your wits about you.

About 350 companies applied for inclusion on this year's list.
I’m not sure when they told him he had leukemia. He told me it was a blood disorder similar to mononucleosis. It went into remission for quite a while, and I really think he felt he’d be able to play with the team (the Cleveland Browns) and we’d go on with our lives.

So yes, visitors to this weekend's Flowermart will notice a few new things — nothing radical, just new. There's an expanded children's section, called The Beehive, with storytelling, craft-making and some pirates running around. A quilt is being raffled off — "a beautiful piece of artwork," Purcell promises. The Flowermart logo has been altered, adding Mount Vernon's Washington Monument to the traditional flowers. And the slogan for 2012 has been changed, from "Different in sense" to "Blossoming civility."
It's National Crabmeat Day!
TRENTON — Gov. Chris Christie likes to use numbers — a lot of them — to explain to people the enormity of the state's fiscal crisis. But like with many things, context can change the meaning.
But greens -- glorious, leafy greens -- are the foods most missing in modern diets. Kids should eat their greens. Why? Because nutritionally, greens are high in calcium, magnesium, iron, potassium, phosphorous, zinc and vitamins A, C, E and K.

“It is clear that the sidewalk was designed and constructed in accordance with state and local law, which takes pedestrian safety into account,” Smith wrote, adding that a lack of statistical evidence regarding vehicle “movement, mishaps or crashes” led them to the opinion that “a complete re-design and reconstruction” of the sidewalk was not necessary, and it would therefore not contribute to the costs.

Role model: "I consider my mom and one of my past cross country coaches, Diana Kamadulski, to be my biggest role models.

I was privileged to be one of eight voting member of this workgroup; other members included law enforcement representatives, a district attorney and a drug counselor. Last summer, the workgroup met about 10 times, and interviewed the leading national and international experts on the issue. In the end, the workgroup unanimously agreed that there needed to be 1) a strong public education campaign highlighting the dangers of drugged driving; 2) increased data collection; 3) more drug recognition experts trained in identifying drugged drivers; and 4) more research. The CCJJ did not renew its attempt to pursue a 5 nanogram bill this year. As a workgroup member, I saw a near consensus of research demonstrating that drivers with 5 nanograms of THC in their blood are often unimpaired. This is in part because unlike alcohol, THC remains in the blood long after impairment has dissipated.
That diversity partly explains why one recent survey of hoteliers found that of all Western travelers, Americans were most likely to speak the local language.
Jason Morse contends the problems stemmed from a blocked city storm drain on his property that he alleges the city did not maintain, causing water to flood his yard, saturate soil and ultimately put immense pressure on his foundation.

Had the deal not been reached, the district would have outsourced those jobs.
The Racer has a table full of bottles, and those bottles are filled with water. If they break all of the bottles before completing the dance, they have to go to the Pit Stop and incur a two-hour penalty. Do you know how they complete the dance?

Now that the ties to his Giants days are virtually non-existent, Johnson is finding it easier to try and beat the team that drafted him back in 1986.

The group's recommendations include providing all foster kids with luggage, so they can have some dignity when they move, and issuing a photo ID to every child who enters the system, something Fourneau said would simplify things like getting a driver's license.

If the book has good guys, they're the Germans like Gunther - the millions who kept their hands relatively clean while suffering through the loss of two world wars. That's an interesting point of view from a Brit like Kerr. Then again, Bernie Gunther is an interesting kind of guy.
“They currently spend $110,000 each year, including taxes,” Plechner says. “Assuming a net rate of return of 5.5 percent, an average inflation rate of 2.3 percent and a life expectancy of age 90, the couple’s financial plan suggests that the goal of early retirement is certainly attainable — with some caveats.”

It's the lockstep angst at the highest elevations of the GOP that Newt is a poison-pill nominee who would toss away the best opportunity to topple a Democratic incumbent since Ronald Reagan sent Jimmy Carter back to Plains when Gingrich was a professor at West Georgia College.
Beyond the Internet's well-lit gathering places lies a seedier bazaar of cheap view-sellers, promising deals on quick YouTube fame, but whose methods may be less laudable. A Google search for "buy YouTube views" yields scores of sites such as MoreTubeViews.com and PimpMyViews.com.

"Christ came and served a purpose and had to go," says Henry Abel, 26, who worked with Bryant the past three years. "That's the way he felt — that he served his purpose, and now it's time to let the younger generation take over."
So basically, Xfinity Live! is like a lot of places, sports/bar/entertainment complexes you can find almost anywhere in America these days. Which I guess isn’t a surprise, since the company that developed Xfinity Live!, Cordish Co., has built similar entertainment districts in places like Louisville, Ky. (Fourth Street Live!), Kansas City (Power & Light District) and Baltimore (Power Plant Live!) Clearly, the ridiculous exclamation point is part of the company’s thing. The problem (or should I say The Problem!) for me is that amid the district’s artificial environment, Xfinity Live! doesn’t feel like Philadelphia at all. If you close your eyes, you can almost imagine yourself . . . where? Cleveland? St Louis? Houston? In a red-state city where NASCAR and Big and Rich and megachurches are popular? I’m not exactly sure.

I daydream about presenting family and friends with a tray of beautiful cookies. Then I wake up and face reality. Fortunately, I've learned a few tricks over the years that allow me to say, "Yes, I made these myself," while still getting a good night's rest. Here are some of my favorites, a result of combining professional techniques with a cheapskate's budget.
I asked my brother John to reiterate his concerns and thoughts on it recently, and he said he absolutely supports me in whatever I do and is proud of me -- as is my dad -- but is worried that digging up old stuff and going through it every night will get to me. He is very protective of me and hates being so far away in case something hits the fan.
The Buckeyes started the trend of wearing these promotional Nike uniforms for one game -- the Michigan game -- last season.

Divisions among supporters of each camp have left the race highly unpredictable. Islamists showed their power in elections last year, when the Muslim Brotherhood and members of the conservative Salafi movement won around 70 percent of legislative seats.

In the video interview, Whedon said his most difficult challenge was finding a balance among the characters and their flaws.
The acting performances are all probably a shade better than this movie deserves. Foster's understated performance balances out Ribisi's manic turn, while Wahlberg effectively carries the movie in spite of his constant glower that makes him look like he is perpetually expecting a bar fight to break out.

Staind brought their brand of Nu metal to the stage next with singer Aaron Lewis sporting a Shotgun Betty's trucker cap as they blasted in "Spleen." The soft rocker "Right Here Waiting" followed and Lewis opted out of hitting the higher notes in the song. Lewis has always been known for delivering vocally live but on this night it was his screaming during heavier tracks like "Eyes Wide Open" that were his strengths. The singer told the crowd "This is a song ya'll can sing along to" before "So Far Away" which half of the crowd seemed to know. New drummer Sal Giancarelli's electronic toms were also a bit distracting at times and sounded out of place in the mix. Lewis ditched the guitar during 2001's radio rocker "For You" which sounded as good as it did over a decade ago as the singer roamed around in the shadows on the stage.

For years, air travelers have complained that airlines weren't adequately disclosing these so-called ancillary fees -- indeed, that airlines were benefiting from a widespread assumption that checking a bag was included in the airfare, as it still is on Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways. But on Aug. 23, a new Transportation Department regulation went into effect, requiring airlines to disclose all fees for optional services through a prominent link on their websites. It's just the first volley in what could be a protracted war between airlines and the government over fee disclosure.
The Mustangs' defense frustrated the Bears (11-2-3), holding them to one shot on goal, and that came early in the first half.
The Sox gave Sale a two-run lead before he took the mound. Alejandro De Aza singled and stole second base, and Brent Morel, fighting a 3-for-26 slump in his previous seven games, walked before Dunn lined a double to left field to score De Aza. Alex Rios' sacrifice fly scored Morel in what turned out to be a 38-pitch inning by Noesi, thanks in large part to A.J. Pierzynski's 11-pitch walk.

A classically trained opera singer, Heather has been doing voice-over work for five years. Her studio? It's in a corner of her house in rural upstate New York, and consists of two luan doors from Home Depot covered with a couple of sound-dampening blankets. Put together a voice-over demo with accents, different voices, range and sound effects (one client needed believable sneezes, which she provided with the aid of snorted pepper). A producer is a good idea for the demo, since he or she will have the equipment already, plus access to things that can enhance it, such as music.

For me, the coolest things in Quito were its two parks devoted to the equator. About 35 minutes north of downtown, the Mitad del Mundo (Middle of the World) memorial commemorates the achievement of French scientists in the early 1700s. They used measurements to pinpoint the equator and prove that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, but slightly flattened at the poles.

That has not been the case with the team's star, Brandon Roy, who has approached this preseason as more of a nuisance than a warmup. Most notable has been his dissmissive approach to the offense.

Roy has a career average of 20.2 points, during which he has averaged 15.6 shots a game. This preseason, he has averaged 7.6 shots a game.

Fettuccine with exotic mushrooms ($16.95) offers a bowlful of musky and rich mushrooms plus a hint of truffle oil, but the pasta itself seems more of a thin egg noodle than a fettuccine, and a bit overdone at that. More perfectly cooked is the ravioli of the day ($16.95), stuffed with portobello mushrooms and served in a creamy vegetable sauce. It’s so easy to smother ravioli, and this one appears to be so, but instead it strikes a Goldilocks balance between thick and thin, heavy and light, rich and creamy.

One other noteworthy aspect of biking to work is that you notice all the pets that live on your selected route. I see them in their yards. I see them on walks with their owners.

Margulies mines quite a bit of humor early in the play from the seeming disconnect between the naïve Mandy and the older characters. At first glance, Mandy seems like anything but a serious human being, but as the play unfolds it is Mandy who poses substantive questions about journalism: What are normal people supposed to do with the record of people murdering each other, as they have for centuries? How can a photographer shoot images of a dying child and not want to help?
"Everything looked good with the tendon," Twins assistant general manager Rob Antony said, relaying the team's medical report.

The rest was fabulous. Amsterdam is precisely the sort of city a child might conjure in her dreams: the concentric circles of canals; the long canal boats with their terraces and little lawns; the overflowing window boxes; the tall houses shoulder to shoulder, their peaked roofs like tricorn hats; the pretty little bridges; the brightly colored doors; and all the bicycles. The Dutch eat pancakes for lunch, put mayonnaise on French fries, have a really big park and what isn't easily accessible by foot can be quickly reached by really cool trams.

That philosophy is apparent at the entrance of Mr. Muñoz's 6,000-square-foot ivy-covered Tudor, on a street lined with other traditional mansions in the historic district. Decorated for the city's annual Fiesta Week, its front lawn is festooned with an 8-foot-tall sculpture of a dog made from multicolored plastic flowers, a homage to Jeff Koons's topiary sculpture "Puppy." Bright plastic piñata flowers float in an old stone bird bath. A glittery, beribboned wreath adorns its tall front door.
But the potential market for Highland's chemical process remains unclear. Its success probably depends on state lawmakers' deciding to either require drug manufacturers to install chemical locks in their pseudoephedrine drugs, or at least permit medicines using such protections to be sold over the counter without identity checks.
“We just need to move on from that game,” McMillan said. “I thought the guys played a good game. We didn’t shoot the ball well, but played hard and we gave ourselves a chance.

Mr. Rupp's bill moves the St. Louis region closer to the sort of regional development cooperation that could make us strong. It puts the power where it belongs, in commissions that represent all taxpayers, not just a few of them. House members should ignore their municipal lobbyists and look to the voters for direction.

Ebertfest 2012 was dedicated to Dutch-Australian director Paul Cox, who has attended the festival more times than any other filmmaker. David Bradbury's documentary "On Borrowed Time" is both a celebration of his life and work (Cox has made 20 features and 11 documentaries) and a chronicle of his near fatal experience with liver cancer. On Christmas 2009, he received a liver transplant that saved his life. "When I became aware of what had happened to me after the transplant," Cox said after the film, "and everybody was happy and congratulating me and all that, the only thing I felt was unbelievable grief for this young man who had died on Christmas Day."

At rough count, he got the NBA Question more than a half-dozen times Saturday, and with each one you could see a cloud slide across his face.

--- Todd McShay, Steve Muench and Kevin Weidl, ESPN’s Scouts Inc.: Courtney Upshaw, OLB/DE, Alabama. “Upshaw has impressive power when setting the edge against the run and when finishing as a pass-rusher. He can also provide flexibility with his ability to play outside linebacker in a 3-4 or end in a 4-3. There are questions, though, about whether he has already maxed out his football potential.”
The injunction request, filed in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, was made in the interest of the community's safety, Norton said. The Clinic's decision, announced Oct. 13 and expected to go into effect in early 2011, is "absolutely devastating to this community," he said.

Most of the recital's second half was devoted to the music of the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos (a nod, Sierra explained, to her Portuguese heritage). "Modinhas e canções," a collection of folk-tinged melodies, brought out her liveliest and most alluring side, particularly in the heartbreakingly beautiful "Lament of the Marqueza de Santos." (The only thing that could have improved the performance would have been one or two fewer remarks about hot-blooded, sensual Latins.)

Try tangle. Staub’s altercation with Laurita’s daughter, Ashley Holmes, at the North Jersey Country Club in November will certainly be featured (Holmes was later found guilty of assault for pulling out one of Staub’s hair extensions).

As early as Tuesday morning, the Committee for More Michigan Jobs could get approval from the State Board of Canvassers to launch a campaign to persuade Michigan voters to let the group build those two casinos and six more.

Chet's observation has been amplified a thousand times these days, viewing all the news, and all the news sources there are now. Indeed, it must be a very, very tough assignment for writer and producers in all forms of media to choose a lead story or to create even a "stack" in order of importance to a mass audience. The random thoughts I have to impart below are far from original, and won't make anyone's lead stories, but I think may be shared by a few people, to wit:
It generally takes about five minutes after I've been introduced to someone before the questions start coming. "What is your favorite restaurant?" is followed, inevitably, by the next most urgent question: "Where's a great Chinese restaurant in my neighborhood?" As if I'm holding out.

If I were going to recommend only one of these programs, of the more than several I've seen — and it may not be a bad idea to watch only one — it is History Channel's "9/11: The Days After" (Friday). A sequel to the 2008 "102 Minutes That Changed America" (which will be rebroadcast on Biography, A&E, History and Lifetime on Sept. 11), it begins in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Twin Towers. Assembled mostly from home video and B-roll news footage, it proceeds without narration or talking heads. What would usually be considered mistakes — false starts, wild shots, random chatter — are left in for immediacy. It is a construction, unavoidably, but one that does not tell you what to think or how to feel — there is a quiet score, which helps knit the pieces without unduly coloring it — and puts you, as much as possible, into the place and time. As such it is hard to watch, and impossible to turn off.

On the role of the poet, she has written, "We may feel bitterly how little our poems can do in the face of seemingly out-of-control technological power and seemingly limitless corporate greed, yet it has always been true that poetry can break isolation, show us to ourselves when we are outlawed or made invisible, remind us of beauty where no beauty seems possible, remind us of kinship where all is represented as separation."

In “The Conflict: How Modern Motherhood Undermines the Status of Women,” out now, Badinter claims that in the past 30 years, Western women — with the exception of the French — have moved away from championing equal rights and regressed to stay-at-home motherhood and years-long, on-demand breast-feeding, all in the service of what she labels “maternalism.”
A key part of Obama's approach was to appeal to the lawmakers in front of him to pass a deal, and to position them for blame for inaction should the jobs plan fall short.
Hudson told detectives that her family hadn't known of her sister's marriage to Balfour in late 2006 until months later. Her sister told prosecutors that Hudson had previously advised her sister against marrying Balfour.

That's the way a lot of Catholics felt about Protestants in general and evangelicals in particular in pre-Vatican II days. And even after the council, liberal Catholics retained their distaste for "Bible-thumpers." My own prejudices against evangelicals, initially formed in the Catholic ghetto, were reinforced by liberal Protestant professors. But for other, younger Catholics, there has been a cross-pollination with evangelicals that is not your father's ecumenical movement. At my Catholic high school in the 1960s, we were assured that there was no conflict between Darwinism and Catholicism. Today a biology teacher at a Catholic school must be braced for questions about why he isn't giving equal time to intelligent design. Rick Santorum has raised this very issue.

But color isn't the exclusive domain of fashion. This year, luxury Italian company Sawaya & Moroni produced their best-selling metal "Meteo-Out" chair as a counter stool in the neon colors of the spring runways (€600). The chairs were chosen by a Singapore design school for a student project. "They will effectively buy a bunch and then remake and personalize them," says Paolo Moroni. Sawaya & Moroni also displayed its considerable manufacturing prowess with the high-density, polyurethane, two-toned "Fei Fei" chairs (€880), designed by William Sawaya and made from five different molds based on an origami piece. "They should technically not be possible to make," says Mr. Moroni, "but the trick is inside the structure, there is another structure."
Perhaps it was similar advice that led Fewell to design the game plan for the regular-season meeting with the Pats.
Sim has deep ties to Corvallis. His mother (cheer) and father (football and track and field) both graduated from OSU, where they were heavily involved in athletics.

A: While tire-pressure monitoring systems are great safety aids, they may allow tire pressure to fall 25% below the recommended level before giving a warning, and some tire experts say such a loss is too great. Losing that much air from a tire can cause handling problems and possibly damage the tire, so it is better to check each tire yourself once a week or so. Also, monitors can malfunction.

The next batter, Mike Moustakas, rapped a double, took third on a fielder's choice and scored when Getz hit a sharp grounder into the shortstop hole. Benoit has given up a run in each of his past two outings. His 4.35 ERA is almost three runs higher than the 1.33 ERA he posted during his 27 appearances after the All-Star break last year.

On Second Monday in 1983, 37-year-old Virginia Wade beat Eva Pfaff (3-6, 7-5, 7-5) to reach her last Wimbledon quarterfinal. In 2003, Mark Philippoussis smashed 46 aces to upset Andre Agassi, then the world's No. 1 player. Second Monday also introduced the world to the man who would changed tennis forever: In 2001, 19-year-old Roger Federer ended Pete Sampras's run of four straight Wimbledon titles and 31 consecutive wins (Sampras said he would be back for many years to come, but played here just one more time). Last year, Second Monday claimed three prominent casualties: Andy Roddick, Caroline Wozniacki and Maria Sharapova.

However, McCourt needs to focus as well — on selling the team and getting out of the business of running the Dodgers. If he can effect a sale to an MLB-approved buyer without giving up the parking lots, good for him. But if every bidder is going to walk away from the negotiating table because the land around the stadium isn't in play, or if the only bidders who will agree to buy the team without the lots can't survive MLB's scrutiny, then it's time for McCourt to reevaluate his selling terms. He should make the deal that compensates him best but also allows him to fully relinquish the Dodgers to a new owner and a new era in Chavez Ravine.

The YWCA did not want the old Locust site and its history to be forgotten. It had provided five decades of community support to girls and women and well as housing, primarily for rural women who moved to the city for work. The wives and girlfriends of soldiers stationed at Jefferson Barracks and Fort Leonard Wood stayed there. And the housing also served entertainers such as Butterfly McQueen, an actress best known for her role in "Gone With the Wind."

Opt also for the Roast Turkey Platter ($8.49), two thick white-meat steaks still succulent under a classic thickened gravy and standard mashed potatoes. Our "Classic Burger" ($5), smaller than the menu's usual half-pounders, delivered good flavor in a leaner package. And the Raspberry Pecan salad special with grilled chicken ($9) was a worthy attempt at Ruthie-styled sparkle. Thumbs down, however, on the pale iceberg side salad with the roast turkey - all the personality of white bread.

When the entrees get away from the carnivorous, things can get a little wobbly.

I'm not inclined to speculate about consolidation in the market or in the industry. What I do feel very comfortable saying is that we're committed to the marketplace and we'll continue to grow here.

Those who aren't able to do that ultimately won't be around.

"So I know there was deliberation between us and two other teams, and quite honestly, I felt like there were — just looking at the numbers — they could've gone in a lot of different ways. But obviously, I was very excited to walk back in and know that we have an opportunity to work again tomorrow, but also know that we have an opportunity to play at home. And that has always been a goal for our locker room, to have an opportunity to come back to Ridley and to play one more time. Obviously, we've been rewarded for that."

At the moment, the Obama administration is seeking a middle path of reducing military spending largely by drawing down the war in Afghanistan and scrapping one or two obviously anachronistic weapons systems like the stealth F-22 Raptor, which costs $143 million a pop. Obama's approach, although less damaging than Romney's blueprint, doesn't go far enough to save our economy or our country. We need to reduce military spending at least as much as Eisenhower or Nixon did after the Korean and Vietnam wars. They trimmed the Pentagon's budget by 27 percent and 29 percent respectively.

"It's time for people to be upfront if they have concerns," Warren said. "Let's talk about it. Bring them to us. But to say in secret, 'We're concerned because it's a mental health hospital,' to say that in whispered tones, just perpetuates the very bias that I would hope our community overcame a long time ago.

Texas A&M wanted out and announced it was leaving for the greener pastures of the Southeastern Conference.

King had more than a dream, he had a plan. Built on his theology and radiating from his core beliefs, the plan converted the congregation.

Some have suggested that the move to AVI has nothing to do with funding our schools, that linking the two is little more than a political distraction. We respectfully disagree. In cities, counties, boroughs and townships across the country, property taxes are the critical linchpin to funding public education. Homeowners have a vested interest in assuring that children in their community receive a quality education, have a fair shot at a good-paying job and ultimately end up reinvesting in the neighborhood. That is why people who can, when they have children, move out of the city to the Pennsylvania suburbs or New Jersey, where the taxes are much higher but schools are much better because of the larger investment.
