Speed bowling is something I did not think I would revisit after Aug. 21-22, 1998, when my attempt to break the Guinness World Record for 24-hour pinfall fell tens of thousands of pins short.

Hey, Chris: I agree. The Cavs ask so much from James, he should not have to or be expected to recruit the next coach. Just as he shouldn't be asked to watch draft workouts or negotiate contracts. It was surprising that he declined to even have a conversation with Izzo out of respect no matter what he was willing to say. But no one can say James does not do his superstar part for the franchise, in this beat writer's opinion.
Midway through the second, Chicago notched its second power-play goal. Jordan Schroeder received a pass in the left circle and went top-shelf with authority. It was nothing fancy -- just a clean, hard shot past a quality goalie, Cedrick Desjardins.

A: That’s absolutely right. He’s quite lonely, you know. I think he’s disappointed in what the world threw at him, and the little it threw at him. I think he’s expecting, like a lot of men and maybe a lot of Irish men, the female equivalent of a knight in shining armor, whatever that is. A Rapunzel with shining hair, maybe? But someone who’ll see him for all his hidden qualities, and rescue him from himself. And I don’t think he’s on his own in that regard. I can’t say I was a million miles away from that myself all the time.

For a few years in the late '80s, no band represented Jersey better than this Carteret quartet did. They took two Garden State trends -- the Mod pop revival then swirling away in New Brunswick and muscular, streamlined Turnpike heavy rock -- and combined them to create something unprecedented. Thanks to guitarist Jim Babjak, the band rocked harder than any band in the Paisley Underground. And because he wrote about the dissolution of actual grown-up relationships, Pat DiNizio's songs are darker than anything penned by his heavy metal contemporaries. Time and again, DiNizio returned to the line between love and madness; the title of "Green Thoughts," the Smithereens' '88 set, referred not to the environment but to all-consuming jealousy.

In one sense, Shaw's job is easier than Harbaugh's was when he took over the Cardinal. Before moving to the 49ers, Harbaugh was more successful than any Stanford head coach in many years.

I'm the No. 3 pitcher and, when I'm on my game, nobody can stop me."

LOSS OF IDENTITY. Long term, many industry mavens are saying that American has to merge, which could even mean being acquired by a smaller line with a stronger financial position. Most speculation centers on US Airways, but that line isn't a great fit. Its current product is mediocre, at best, and it has only a few of the lucrative long-haul international routes that American needs. In such a merger, "American Airlines" would undoubtedly survive as the brand name, but the "look and feel" of the airline could change substantially -- and most likely for the worse.

In fact, the results have been dramatic - in the other direction. Since decriminalization lifetime prevalence rates (any consumption over a lifetime) have decreased, especially for the critical adolescent-young-adult population cohort. For 13-15-year-olds the rate decreased from 14.1 percent in 2001 to 10.6 percent in 2006. For 16-18-year-olds, the lifetime prevalence rate, which had increased from 14.1 percent in 1995 to 27.6 percent in 2001, fell to 21.6 percent in 2006. Perhaps most significantly, heroin use, which officials felt was the most socially destructive drug, fell from 2.5 percent to 1.8 percent from 1999-2005.

Lewis explains why the alcohol makes (he switches to present tense when retelling each drug and drink experience) him feel so good, how the brain, "nesting in its self-made cave of unhappiness, gets a wake-up call from a team of molecules born in a vat in Scotland." He explains how the cerebral cortex is a "super-network of communicating neurons, babbling neurons, pulsing neurons ... this electrical sea is where we really live." And how the equilibrium of this sea, how we excite or inhibit its molecules depending on what we feed it, impacts our moment-to-moment experiences, and cumulatively our lives.

It's worth noting that the writer-director, Craig Brewer, is white. That doesn't make his film any more or less admirable, or valid, but it certainly marks him as someone able to cross cultural boundaries with confidence and success. (Though there might have been no film at all if John Singleton, the director of "Boyz N the Hood," hadn't decided to finance it out of his own pocket.) I found "Hustle & Flow" hard to get into at first, if only for its dialogue. But DJay's turf turns out to be everyone's turf -- a jagged landscape of hopes, disappointments, folly and fulfillment.
As a writer, Hillerman was known for what Newsweek magazine in 1989 referred to as his brilliant "evocation of nature and place -- particularly the desolation of the Southwest."

Davis goes back to the 19th century and traces the era in which industrialization took off hand in hand with the expansion of the British Empire. At the start of the 1800s, living standards were pretty comparable on most continents, but by the dawn of the 20th century, a pattern of plunder and inhuman exploitation had been fully established.

Each test lasted as long as a single 100-foot roll of film. Each was shot at 24 frames per second and projected at two-thirds of that speed, a trick Warhol often used. Each took a little less than three minutes to film, and takes a little more than four to watch. The slow-motion effect adds a discernible flicker, heightens every movement and contributes to the dreamy, ghostly quality.

That's an issue that Sen. Jolie Justus, D-Kansas City, has been pushing for several years.
He's probably the most versatile defensive lineman for Rutgers and is probably the team's most important "6th man" if there were one in football. He can play defensive end and defensive tackle and creates mismatches at both positions. At defensive end, he's a strong and long player that can bullrush or get around you with his quickness. At tackle, he has the ability to take advantage of the stunts Rutgers loves to run inside and use his agility and quickness to make plays on the quarterback or a running back. Both are going to be huge on a defensive line that has a lot of tall and lean defensive ends and stout defensive tackles.
On the other hand, Robert Downey Jr. is back as Holmes and Jude Law returns as Dr. Watson. They retain the winning chemistry from the first, superior film, and that's enough to make you soldier on through the overly stylized action. And Holmes finally has a worthy adversary here: Professor James Moriarty, his brilliant arch nemesis, played by Jared Harris with the appropriate intellectual arrogance. Throw in Stephen Fry as Mycroft, Sherlock's brother, and the scales tip in Ritchie's favor -- at least when the action slows enough to make room for witty banter.
For all its gifts, Stevenson's story was apparently found lacking in revolutionary fervor by the makers of this version, and in some respects it plays out like "Treasure Island" as told by Che Guevara. Squire Trelawney, for instance, is turned into a vile capitalist pig whose greed kills and (nearly) causes prostitution. The new ending, too, is a trite trick and a big disappointment.

The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 allows homeowners to exclude canceled or forgiven debt from taxable income when it involves their principal home, whether it's from a short sale, a mortgage restructuring or a foreclosure. That means even though the lender may send the homeowner a Form 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt, the sum doesn't have to be declared as income. However, that provision is set to expire at the end of 2012, which means that if the home is sold as a short sale beginning Jan. 1, 2013, it will have to be reported as income the following year.

Larsson admits it has been a struggle to get paid for all that time and effort; most of his revenue comes from Medicaid, a state-federal program for the poor and disabled.

None of this -- none of it -- is handled in a heavy-handed way. While Iranian customs and practices may be foreign to a Western audience, the dilemmas and feelings are not. Every character in this film is relatable in some way. Though a Western audience's inclination may be to side with Nader and Simin, Farhadi brilliantly leads us to understanding where Razieh, and even Hodjat, is coming from, as well. That and the mystery he builds bit by bit, combine for manipulation of the best kind. The search for the truth is messy, as it would necessarily be, even without the added roadblocks Iranian society throws up along the way.

The difference between yes-on-28 people and the folks who misplace their faith in term limits is that we readily admit that we want pols to stay put and do a little work before churning their way through other campaigns, other fundraising cycles, other elections and other offices. Cynical as newspaper people may become, we have enough faith in politics and democracy to know that some of the real clunkers who are elected to the Legislature will eventually be turned out. The way things stand now, they can grab another seat somewhere before voters get a chance to notice their incompetence.

But Ryan wants to end Medicare, doesn't he? Ryan proposes introducing an element of choice into Medicare 10 years from now while limiting the program's growth to the GDP growth rate plus 0.5 percent, the same spending goal that the president sets out in his own budget. If Ryan is "red in tooth and claw" on Medicare, so is the president. The difference is that President Obama prefers a price-setting bureaucratic panel to competition as his Darwinistic tool to weed out the maladapted elderly.
Extensive searches at the time uncovered nothing and many historians are convinced they crashed into the ocean. In addition, conspiracy theories, including claims that they were U.S. government agents captured by the Japanese before the Second World War, still abound despite having been largely debunked.
Clint Bowyer finished fourth, Marcos Ambrose was fifth and pole-winner Logano was sixth. It was a huge turnaround for Logano, who used coaching from Max Papis to score his career-best road course finish.

Oakland - Jemile Weeks (12)
The flights mark the latest move in BWI's checkered campaign to develop a robust international service. For the past dozen years, many foreign carriers have come and gone after brief stays — Aer Lingus, Mexicana and Icelandair among them — even as the airport's domestic fortunes have soared. The Gov. William Donald Schaefer International Terminal, which opened in 1997 at a cost of $147 million, often appears all but deserted.

Picture sleeves are juxtaposed throughout the book, drawing often humorous parallels that underscore how artists rubbed off on each other, consciously or otherwise. Compare the covers of Michael Jackson's "Human Nature" and his sister La Toya's Jackson's "Heart Don't Lie." "If you look really close, the jewels are different, but the bow tie and the sweater vest are exactly the same," Chojnacki says. "It seems like they were in on it together."

You could hear these issues play out on a recent day in this key presidential swing state — first, at the equal pay protest, but later at a hotel near Broncos stadium, where five conservative women led a panel discussion to strategize about reframing the rhetoric and working to woo more women voters to their camp this year. There was passion, but there was also irritation. Some women said talk about contraception was a distracting sideshow; others said the preoccupation of some politicians with abortion showed they were out of touch.
Some of the smaller works suggest the very beginnings of painting, with pale washes and tentative strokes of color, but larger works such as "Beijing Booster #602" are bold, the canvas bejeweled with beadlike forms that dangle like a necklace from bold, black, curvilinear lines.

At first, Ross drove us as close as possible past the destruction in the Central Business District (with the full cordon up, there was no angle for seeing the cathedral, the symbol of the earthquake's force). He covered the hard data: More than 900 buildings in the district are tagged for demolition and, possibly, to never be rebuilt; 6,000 structures in the region are red-tagged; and the relatively new AMI Stadium, the outlet for rabid rugby pride, will probably have to be demolished.

Then, other agencies that depend on the General/Lottery funds would make their cases to the legislature for the remaining funds. This is the only way to stabilize school funding.

Like Draper, Gatsby seemed to have it all, but having it all meant only wanting more. The fabled "green light" at the end of Tom and Daisy Buchanan's dock, which Gatsby could see from his own Long Island mansion, represented everything he couldn't have. More to the point, it represented what Jay Gatsby could never be: someone other than himself. A lifetime of trying to run away from his past leaves him, in Fitzgerald's famous summary, "borne back ceaselessly into the past."
They cheerfully paid at least $90 a head to hurl themselves over walls, under half-submerged obstacles, into the grip of low-voltage wires and other challenges spread over an 111/2-mile course at the old Buckeye Quarry.
And there is also a constitutionally established backup. The Ohio Supreme Court oversees the practice of law in this state and already can -- and does -- suspend or remove judges who are physically or mentally unable to perform their duties.
I liked that owner Paul Allen wrote that open letter to Blazers fans on Tuesday. It's a forum he's comfortable with. There wasn't a lot of news there, but it was an attempt to connect with his consumer. I've called on him in recent months to tell us if he's in or out as an owner, and what I read felt as good as any Allen answer I've heard in 10 years of covering his franchise.

Romney, who dropped out of the running for the nomination in 2008, days before Maryland voted, is easily the most organized candidate in the state this time.

The subject of an unflattering episode on Gordon Ramsay’s "Kitchen Nightmares," this restaurant legend, which opened in the Ironbound in 1963, apparently was in dire need of a menu makeover. Did Ramsay, the enfant terrible of TV food shows, rescue Spanish Pavillion from mediocrity? Time will tell. But he did overhaul the menu, which can only be a good thing.
"It will be every bit as luxurious as the original Titanic, but of course it will have state-of-the-art 21st century technology, and the latest navigation and safety systems," Mr. Palmer said, adding the Chinese navy has been invited to escort Titanic II on its maiden voyage from England to New York, scheduled for late 2016.

Banta's only recourse was to get 10 percent of the MSHSAA membership schools to sign a petition by Dec. 15. That allowed for some discussion time at the annual area meetings and to get it placed on the annual ballot. There are 590 member schools, which meant Banta needed at least 59 signatures. He got 78.
A report released by Chan and his colleagues this year found the potential cleaning and maintenance costs should the mussels find their way into the Columbia River's hydropower dams is $25.5 million a year, not including foregone revenues from power generation. That extra expense would likely show up in your power bill.
"It's the Portland myth -- the reputation is stronger and vibrant the farther you get from Portland," said John Charles, chief executive of the Cascade Policy Institute, a nonprofit research center that favors limited government.

In the meantime, many of the families of the men who died continue to struggle with their grief. The day before the Smith brothers were buried in North Carolina, Stacy Greene, Bobo’s longtime girlfriend, answered a call from Adele’s Jeweled Treasures in Cape May. The consignment shop wanted her to know it was the last day to reclaim Bobo’s gold chain. Stacy raced down and paid the bill.

It's also not clear what lawmakers intend to do about the governor's plan to shift to local governments greater responsibility for financing teacher pensions.

The squirrel and "Happy Flight," the chant shortstop Rafael Furcal started for getaway-day wins, are meant to help capture the spirit of the 2011 Cardinals. Other details pushed the manufacturer in new directions. Instead of synthetic rubies that could be molded, Jostens mined rubies that were then hand-shaped into the redbird for the top, an "11" for one side, and on the other side the "STL," which took 28 rubies. The gems are all "conflict-free," Poitras said.

But Flogging Molly never ah-one-and-ah-two-ah'd anything. When the California-based Celtic-punk band is onstage, the music may have an Irish tinge, but it's "Tura Lura" loud . . . and fast. It's a rapid-fire spiel from singer-songwriter and founder Dave King that is as poetic as anything by James Joyce, and just as deep.
Gov. Jay Nixon signed a pension overhaul into law Monday that supporters hope will help the state budget by saving about $660 million over 10 years. It also could offset the cost of offering Ford Motor Co. and other automotive manufacturers $150 million in tax breaks over the next decade.

Consumers also have a financial stake in the decision, said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a health consumer advocacy group in Washington.

And it's remarkably expensive. But, then, the limited-edition R comes round only once every four years. VW will build 5,000 of the new one, then quit. Period.
A: Most workouts are way too aggressive. Thousands of lunges wear out the body. It's not healthy for my client — the one with the bad back, bad knees, diabetes. I'm never going to do that. I'm the only one who takes a humorous approach. Comedy — not screaming at someone — can make someone lift their legs higher. There is a way to do a pushup and a situp, and it doesn't have to be so complicated. Everyone is putting a difficult twist to it and making you do way too much.

Begg's food is equally well-crafted, including a creamy potato and green garlic soup ($9) with bacon, egg and a dusting of red pepper; and two slices of crisp head cheese ($12) served with an appropriately tangy salad with pickled mushrooms, a thick puddle of white bean puree, shishito peppers and a crisp chicharrone. The meat is rich on rich, but the other elements help clear the palate; still, it's an appetizer best shared.
What matters isn't the sheer number of these pathogens but how optimal the conditions are for them later in the growing season, he said. Fungi, for instance, favor damp, cool weather during spring and summer to do their damage to plants such as tomatoes.

More than a quarter-century after its initial release, “Hotel California” retains its power to move, spook, intrigue and confound. Don Henley’s paranoid SoCali poetry and Glenn Frey’s easygoing country-rock often feel like missives from two sides of the same brain, its hemispheres slowly fermenting in the desert heat. The American West mythology and hard-living Los Angeles glamour of the songs — not to mention the airtight harmonies and pop hooks — have endeared the Eagles to generations. The band’s influence on contemporary country music can’t be overstated; many of the genre’s big guns borrow heavily from the Eagles’ sun-baked sonic hallucinations. On June 10, two famous debtors get a chance to say thanks: Keith Urban and the Dixie Chicks, who open the show with sets of their own.

Although pressed for cash, the Childs often ate out. By accident, they discovered Le Grand Vefour, on the northern side of the Palais Royal and one of the oldest and most elegant restaurants in Paris. The head waiter soon got to know them; one day there, Julia spotted the writer Colette, widely known for her voracious appetite.

Some campuses limit the number of lower-paying students they accept, treating it as a scholarship for top students from other states. Some allow these students into only certain majors and departments. (The University of Arizona in Tucson, for example, opens up only mining engineering.)

Euclid wrestling was in danger of becoming, well, history a few years ago as its numbers dwindled to single digits. Like many similar "inner-ring" suburban programs, the Panthers suffered from dwindling interest and support. Two youth feeder programs disbanded. High school student interest waned.

Literally and figuratively, this is a largely colorless production. You'll see that especially in the early sections of the film. The characters' faces and clothing are as faded as the fog-enshrouded marshes near the family forge.

"Sometimes, the game succeeds in spite of itself," said John Shannon, an analyst for Canada TV network SportsNet. "Somebody said to me yesterday, ‘Isn't it great? The ratings are going through the roof.' But there's no accountability. People would actually watch a public execution, too, and we had to outlaw that."
“All-American” is filled with well-observed characterizations, subtly realistic dialogue and comic zingers, the last often delivered by Aaron and his misfit girlfriend (Sarah Steele), but it also has a generic quality that feels more suited for TV than the stage.
