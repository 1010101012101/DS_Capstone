Diabetes affects how the body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is vital to health because it's the main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and virtually all tissues in the body. During digestion, sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream. Normally, sugar then enters cells with the help of insulin. The hormone insulin comes from the pancreas, a gland located just behind the stomach. When a person eats, the pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. As insulin circulates, it allows sugar to enter the cells and lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream.

The common thread in those quotes is the idea undergirding Mamet’s cynical view of social interactions in America — at least as espoused in “Race,” which ends its month-long run at Artists Repertory Theatre on Sunday.

"The season as a whole has gone real well," Pfund said. "I think we still haven't played our best baseball, which is good, because we're getting better every day. We'll start peaking here in the next couple weeks as we get into districts. It's been a good season. Different guys have stepped up at different times. Pitching's been good. Defense for the most part has been good. We'll see what happens over the next few weeks. It should be fun."

Do happy people live in Los Feliz? Well, some. But the area got its name from José Vicente Feliz, an 18th century settler who received this real estate through a Spanish land grant. The Greek Theatre, home to many summer concerts, is a few blocks north of the commercial district on Vermont and Hillhurst avenues. Barnsdall Art Park (including Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House and a picnic-ready grassy knoll at 4800 Hollywood Blvd.) is a few blocks south. Once you snag a parking spot (or arrive at the Sunset-Vermont Metro stop), walk Vermont between Franklin and Prospect avenues. Begin with people watching and caffeination in a sidewalk seat at Figaro (1802 N. Vermont Ave.), which carefully cultivates its French flavor, or Fred 62 (1850 Vermont Ave.), a 24-hour retro-kitsch diner with lime-green walls. Both draw celebrities and often show up on TV, and among customers at either, you may encounter attitude. (For larger outdoor dining areas and more people-watching, there's also Alcove Café at 1929 Hillhurst Ave. and Home restaurant at 1760 Hillhurst Ave.) Browse Skylight Books (1818 N. Vermont Ave.), and check this week's T-shirts at Y-Que Trading Post (1770 N. Vermont Ave.), where today's news is tomorrow's silk-screen theme. (Recent inspirations: the fragile states of Egypt and Charlie Sheen.) If you stay on the block for dinner or drinks, the dull façade of Dresden Restaurant (1760 Vermont Ave.; since 1954) conceals a neighborhood treasure: the lounge act of Marty and Elayne, who have been playing and singing, Tuesdays through Saturdays, sometimes in matching caftans, for nearly 30 years.

Perhaps Sean is more comfortable with Jewish beliefs. Jews readily understand that the Earth was created in six days (and that God rested on the seventh). And they appreciate Noah's survival of a great flood after building an ark big enough to hold two of each animal, the drowning of the oppressive Pharaoh's army after Moses parted the Red Sea, and the conquest of Canaan, complete with walls toppled by shouts and the sun standing still in the sky.

Why it could change: The Sooners are in a rut; there’s no other way to look at it. Any other program would do backflips to have OU’s track record, but the Sooners have lost 10 games in three seasons since they played for the 2008 BCS national championship. This team needs its mojo back—in a big way.

Unfortunately, she hasn't seen much of it, and won't. Though she will have plenty free time on this tour, she will not be able to explore the city's lovely boutiques and spacious plazas. The open wound on what remains of her right foot--which was crushed in a notorious, 1995 Metra rail accident that also took her left leg above the knee--is stinging with pain. And walking, which she does only in spurts even when her injuries are in better repair, just will make matters worse.
Interactive white boards essentially are oversized touch-screen computers. They are typically installed on the wall, where a chalkboard would be, and can interact with the teacher and students. Teachers can create multimedia presentations, access Internet resources and instantly create charts and graphs. Students answer questions right on the board and can instantly see the answer. These tools enhance the expertise and enthusiasm of teachers, bringing concepts to life in a new way.

Back home in California, long before our trip, I'd been surprised to see a half-dozen Madeira wines prominently displayed at a top San Francisco restaurant called Frances. It's a small place that doesn't carry a lot of wine, but the restaurant's wine director told me that Madeira goes well with many more dishes than other fortified wines would. During our visit to the island, we found that Madeira wine did pair nicely with many local dishes and seafood. It's really not just an aperitif. We also enjoyed a Portuguese vinho verde.

The gallery devoted to 19th century American still life and trompe-l'oeil painting, one of the de Young's unique areas of depth, contains a famous multiple by Jasper Johns, "Bread" (1969): a thin lead sheet that appears to hold a slice of ever-fresh white bread.

Readers want those answers, and the newspaper is trying to get them. In recent days, we’ve looked at the concerns of business leaders and property managers, as well as those of protesters and security professionals.

The Buckeyes' biggest change from December has come from Deshaun Thomas, who had something of a breakout game with 19 points, then a season-high, against the Jayhawks. Now a 19-point game is just another night for Thomas, who has reached that mark in eight of his last 12 games.

There's no doubt that 2010 has been a better year than 2009. Data on gross regional product, the measure of all the goods and services produced in Northeast Ohio, show the region's economy growing 3.6 percent in 2010. That's a dramatic reversal from last year, when gross regional produce fell by 6.1 percent, capping several years of declines.

State Sen. Ted Harvey, one of Tancredo's surrogates in the legislature, said he has been on the phone every day with fellow Republicans trying to secure endorsements for Tancredo. His most effective message can be boiled down to one word: redistricting.
If the Nevada pastor had announced his support for Obama at a news conference at city hall and made it clear that he was speaking for himself, he would be within his rights. If the Florida pastor had posted his anti-Mormon screed on his personal Facebook page, there would be no legal problem. Clearly, though, when a minister uses the pulpit, a church newsletter or an editorial in an archdiocesan newspaper to make a promotional statement, the IRS can and should attribute that to his organization. Similarly, if a pastor allows a favored candidate to distribute campaign material with the church bulletin or place pamphlets on car windshields in the church parking lot, he violates federal tax law.

The scarred wood floors give way to patches of distressed concrete covered with thick spills of dried oil or paint. The brick walls are natural in some areas and painted white in others. High ceilings with exposed wood, weathered with age; rusted support beams; shiny new ductwork; and a utilitarian open kitchen give the place a makeshift air, as if the owners just took over a building, put in butcher block tables and chairs, and opened the door. The reality, of course, is that it took nearly a year of construction to put the building in this somewhat raw, primitive state.

Mustapha Mond, the “Controller” who serves as the book’s villain, suppresses old books but perhaps unnecessarily. Think about how publishing works in the age of the Kindle and the Nook: Manufacturers and booksellers no longer have any incentive to try to get you to buy pre-copyright books published before 1922. If a fad suddenly developed for, say, Charles Dickens, there’d be no money to be made because readers could simply download his e-books, free, from Project Gutenberg or some other public-interest site. Dickens’ bicentennial just passed, by the way: remember the big marketing push to take advantage? Neither do I. Amazon won’t be reserving promotional space on its homepage for e-books that earn nothing and it’ll be long before the 26th century when all the classics fade into what the literary critic Clive James called “Cultural Amnesia.” Soon the only readers of these books will be forced ones (i.e. students) but in the age of Twitter how much longer will that last?

"He came into office right after we had the riots after Dr. King's death. He came in during the early '70s when a lot of people were viewing cities as just massive shelters for the poor. Schaefer really focused on the best in cities, not the worst, and became a real advocate for cities. Schaefer viewed cities as good places to invest, good places to develop businesses and families. That was, to me, one of the real significant aspects of his career. He was kind of a leading advocate for urban America at a very difficult time for cities."

That period was a golden age in the history of the American confidence game.

None of those players were quarterbacks or wide receivers, the glamour guys whom the league has gone on a virtual crusade to ensure their proper protection with recent rule changes and a continued increase in defensive unnecessary roughness penalties. And it's understandable why those positions have been looked out for with an increased urgency. They're the ones more often placed in vulnerable, unguarded situations that expose them to potential injury. But most importantly, people are paying to see Tom Brady and Calvin Johnson, not Jake Long and Joe Thomas.

Up by nine in the second half, Michigan State stretched its lead to 13 when Nix, generously listed at 270 pounds, scored underneath and Green, unable to pound it inside to his teammate, knocked down a 3-pointer to make it 60-47. Boyd countered with a 3 for LIU, but after a timeout, Michigan State ripped off six in a row, opening a 66-50 lead on Wood's layup.
øHow they get paid, though, varies. ING Direct is a broker that makes money charging commissions. ING's Portfolio Builder will help you build a portfolio by selecting index funds that are suitable for you. You will then pay the standard commissions when you buy or sell the investments. Commissions are $4 if you agree to have all your orders execute once a week rather than right away. If you don't buy or sell very often, this commission structure might make sense for you. But if you're trading often, the commissions can add up.

Speaking of pornography, does Wolitzer deliver her own polite version, suitable for the Barnes & Noble display table? Not exactly.

In that vein, we also need to find creative ways to overcome the natural barriers that arise between adults and children. As in the adage, "familiarity breeds contempt," sometimes those who see a troubled child the most cannot be expected to be the ones to reset her educational trajectory. That's why support from relatives is important in a family environment. It's also why teachers of electives and enrichment courses, and club advisers are so often the first to make that crucial connection that turns a troubled student around.

It starts with a double-distilled minero and to that is added ripe wild apples, plum, red plantains, pineapples, almonds and a whole chicken breast (skin removed). All this goes through a third fermentation with the chicken suspended with "strings in the atmosphere." The texture and flavor are very round and soft for a spirit of such strength. It is very deep and complex in flavor and aroma with spice, smoke and bright green herbs. The finish is long and lingering.

A It really started with yogurt. We were spending so much money on these little containers of yogurt, and I thought, "I can do this better." So I started playing around with cultured milk, and then I moved into making cheese. Then I started asking myself the same question on all the other things that we were buying. Readers started contributing ideas, too. Then I began to look for a book to help me out, and I couldn't find one. There were some 1970s homestead guides, and some do-it-yourself canning books, but I wanted a book for normal people, for busy parents who had to work but were interested in making real food for their families.

In the recap of last week, Maria and Derek have a backstage high-five failure. It's amusing. Despite myself, I'm kind of liking the almost brother/sister vibe these two have going on. Maria's most memorable year is 1988, when she was 10 years old. She says her parents were immigrants from Greece, working as janitors at Boston bars to support the family. Maria's dress during the interview part of the clip segment is SUPERCUTE. Maria explains that without money for babysitters, her parents would take the kids to work with them, and when she found change on the floor, she'd play Madonna's "Material Girl" on the jukebox. So now it's going to be a rumba, which must mean they're totally changing up the original tempo of the song. Oh, wow, they really are -- this is way more musically adventurous than the DWTS band usually gets. I'm kind of liking it. This is a sexy, sexy rumba, even if it's your typical slinky-slinky-pose-pose dance they do for rumbas. Bruno says he "felt it." And when Derek says "I did, too," Bruno responds with "I bet you did, you naughty boy." Bruno explains they danced the whole song to only the melodic line, that there was no rhythm in the song, and to dance to a song like that is incredibly difficult. When Bruno is impressed and quiet like this it's a major compliment. Len throws out the word "smoldering" and praises the technique.
"(Chess Records founder) Leonard Chess was the most aware of anyone. He went up and down the halls of Chess announcing, 'Etta's crossed over! Etta's crossed over!'

The Chess brothers kept saying how I was their first soul singer, that I was taking their label out of the old Delta blues, out of rock and into the modern era. Soul was the new direction," she wrote in her autobiography. "But in my mind, I was singing old style, not new."

All that would be left up to the legislature to figure out at some later date. A House committee is scheduled to take up the legislation early this morning.
