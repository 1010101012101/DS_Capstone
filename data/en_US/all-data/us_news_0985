“We have to get our big guys swinging the bats. They’ve done that better on this road trip. So that’s a plus. We’ve got two tough clubs coming in but, if you combine those two things, that will take care of most of those problems.”
Eight horses are entered in the 110th Grand National with Private Attack, the defending champion of both this race and the Hunt Cup, the prohibitive favorite.

He’ll need to — and quickly — if he has any hope of winning the Republican nomination. The unlikely presidential contender has little campaign organization in Iowa, New Hampshire and other states where voting begins in less than three months. And he hasn’t done much else in those places to capitalize on his recent surge in polls.
A blandly safe and moderately pretty tween time-waster, with Selena Gomez as a teenager in Paris who gets mistaken for a bratty British heiress. It's forgettable, and meant to be, designed for moms who want to give a 10-year-old a treat. (Newark Star-Ledger)
"I've always said, 'I don't understand why you don't have a studio.'" Or, as Martine recalls Funk's bandmate Colin Meloy saying after the Burnett sessions: "Why didn't you do this sooner?"
Workers basked in the moment. Following a year in which thousands of their friends and co-workers lost jobs, their employer went through bankruptcy and the future of auto manufacturing in the Mahoning Valley was at risk, they see hope for a comeback.

Although neither Alstede nor any others who voted to remove Swan mentioned Christie’s name, Alstede said in an interview with The Star-Ledger earlier this week that “the governor has an opinion about who should be serving as executive director” and “the governor’s opinions are important.”
Sandler in drag is the marquee gimmick this time, playing whiny, smothering and easily humiliated Bronx spinster Jill, who's come to her successful commercial-director brother Jack's well-appointed Los Angeles mansion for a Thanksgiving visit that turns into an extended stay. Jack's various reactions to the prospect of more "twin time" with sis — despair, anger, meanness — are some of the more understandable emotions in this dispiriting exercise.

Still, conditions did improve in most of the nation in May. Just under 40 percent of counties were deemed economically stressed in May, compared with 42 percent in April.

"Before the game, the South City coach (Daryl Semien) asks me why David was on crutches the previous week. So I tell him. He hugged me, told me to let him know if there's anything I need.
That would leave two open bullpen spots, meaning the Yankees could carry a long reliever, opening the door for the likes of Warren, Mitchell and Phelps. In camp a year ago, Girardi sensed uncertainty from all three right-handers, none of whom have ever appeared in the major leagues.
The menu can read like a dozen other restaurants: a salumi platter ($10 for two selections); cheese platter ($10 for two selections); juicy lamb meatballs, though Ristobar's are made distinct with a tangy zucchini sauce ($12); and pizza ($ 10-$12).
Like Kennedy, Simmons said he normally didn't get involved in local races. He noted that he had just organized a fundraiser that brought in $3 million for the Obama re-election campaign. But Kucinich, he insisted, is too important a progressive icon -- the "wind at the back," pushing Obama leftward -- to lose.
A month later, then-Auditor Jim Petro launched a special audit covering 1988 to 1997, all but three of the years Russo had served as the county's elected recorder.

There's a section of the menu that are classics: mussels and fries, escargot, beef tartare and sweetbreads. The rest changes. The idea is that I walk into the cooler and say to myself, "Today is a brand new day. What are we going to do?" For any new dish I come up with, the three questions I have to ask are: "Does it make sense in terms of being up to our standards?" Number two: "Will the item evoke a reaction from the diner, some kind of emotional response?" And, number three, "Will we be able to execute the dish consistently?" So it's this daily creative process we go through and it's how we find meaning and respect for ingredients.
This will be the third time in the past four years that Indiana has met Green Bay in the conference finals.
"We'd like to have the legislation passed intact because it is a comprehensive piece of legislation with a comprehensive plan and everything feeds off other things," Jackson said in an interview.

Created by Seth Corr, the list covers 20 regions; considering the vast selection, prices are exceptional. The more expensive wines, in fact, are near retail price.
Whedon avoids choppy, whiplash-edited action scenes in favor of a measured elegance. And his genre sensibility is pop-retro; if you can't quite hear pages turn, you can certainly let your eyes linger (especially during one panorama-style shot, set to Alan Silvestri's lush John Barry-style score, that locates each hero mid-fight). This is how it should be: Everything's in its place, so why rush?
"When every investigative lead, every single witness that is pertinent, every forensic scientific technique has been exhausted and we have run into a dead end, a case becomes cold," he said.
ANAHEIM, Calif. — Jesus Montero found himself with a few spare minutes Friday night.
Thomas Young, a former Jackson County medical examiner, testified for the defense. He argued that he did not believe an adult could shake a baby to death and discarded national research - some of it written by Case - on shaken baby syndrome.
Any clichés in the script are easily overcome through the total conviction of the cast, especially Inga Wilson as LV, whose voice is anything but small. Wilson, Planet Ant's artistic director, proves an excellent mimic, belting out familiar pop hits in her bedroom while flanked by stacks of vinyl.
Rockwood also selected groups of parents, teachers and community leaders to meet with finalists before the board unanimously named Bruce Borchers from Minnesota.
"A Thistledown official in human resources called to tell me that being the face of racing at both tracks was a conflict of interest," said Ratliff, who is also a councilman in Marion, Ohio. Ratliff is a harness racing announcer at a variety of county fairs throughout the summer.

"It's kind of the same way we looked at it when Jacquizz entered the ranks a couple of years ago," Riley said. "We don't have right now a No. 1 back that's going to replace Jacquizz right now today."
The senior was one the Rams’ unquestioned leaders on defense. His smarts always left him in the right spot to make a play. The sure tackler was one of the big reasons Fordham Prep claimed the CHSFL Class AA title.
When the restaurant opened, plates were set before diners in unison. On my recent return visit, our first course was brought by one person, who put the wrong dishes in front of us. The sommelier poured the wine and then asked if it was too warm. It was, and should never have been served at that temperature - especially in a place where the wine list is so expensive.
Because of the data release, Missouri patients are empowered to make more informed decisions about their health care, said Suzanne Henry, policy analyst at Consumers Union.
In the past month, volunteers have been scrambling to dig out from snowdrifts as high as 20 feet in some sections of the dirt trail, and solid ice 6 feet deep on the paved sections. There was talk that the race, which attracts mountain bikers from around the world, would have to be canceled.
Theft is up among cash-handling workers, Simikian said. "The odd thing is that they do not take responsibility for it. They're almost offended that they're being questioned, even if the evidence is all there." But the No. 1 reason - "by far" - for which young workers are fired is poor attendance, he said. "It really is unbelievable. Being chronically late is out of control."
Hawthorne Bridge Centennial Party: July 31, 9 to 11 p.m., on the bridge. Music and multimedia spectacle.
Saints 34, Panthers 3 - Drew Brees threw for 253 yards and 2 TDs to help New Orleans romp to keep pace in the NFC South. The visiting Saints held Carolina to 195 yards and the Panthers lost QB Matt Moore and running back Jonathan Stewart to injuries in the 1st half.
Team Paso danced a fiery, dramatic -- and shirtless (for the guys) -- dance that was so well done the crowd wouldn't stop cheering so that the judges could talk. Carrie Ann said, "That's going to go down in history as the fan favorite." And Len noted: "You three undressed to impress." Despite the raves, the judges gave it only a 26. The ballroom audience was vocal in expressing their disagreement.
One month into the season, the identity of that option remains unclear. Contreras, newly active after flexor tendon surgery, still needs to prove he can handle the consistent grind of high-leverage situations. Bastardo needs to prove he can locate consistently and pitch with authority with a repertoire that lacks some of its sizzle from a year ago.

I'll bet the Steelers aren't laughing. Not after being "Tebowed" - having their season's hopes dashed by a Tebow pass leading to a game-winning touchdown in overtime that had me jumping and screaming. Then there was Tebow, live in HD, on bended knee, giving thanks for another victory.
What's worse, the tale of Bullock's preternatural benevolence? She once treated the cast of "The Lake House" to a round of Jamba Juice, recalls co-star Ebon Moss-Bachrach. Yes, but did she throw in a Flax and Fiber Boost? If so, well, that's right up there with donating a kidney.
This is a quarterback who in the 10-year period from 2001-10 led the Indianapolis Colts to an average record of 12-4. During that span, he won four NFL most valuable player awards, two AFC championships and one Super Bowl.
Public school students in grades 1-8 are required to take the CRCT in reading, English and math. Students in grades 3-8 also take science and social studies exams.
Regulatory incentives gave a push, too. The European Central Bank lets any bank in the euro area deposit government bonds in return for short-term loans, under so-called repurchase, or "repo," agreements. This was profitable for banks, since bond yields exceeded their interest cost for repo loans, and was initially a spur to buy euro-zone bonds.

Additionally, research has found that men who engage in regular sex are less likely to suffer from prostate cancer, as ejaculation helps to release toxins from the body and promote healthy functioning. A healthy life is one that includes sexual pleasure, and men shouldn't have to choose between the two. Luckily, medical research is progressing every day, and if you are suffering from sexual side effects, you have options. Talk to a doctor and commit to a happy, healthy life - inside and outside the bedroom!
City inspectors hadn't visited the six apartments above McMahon's Irish Pub for at least 16 years, even though they found multiple violations in the downstairs bar as recently as March 15. The entire building was scheduled for an inspection in July, and surviving tenants told the Star Tribune that inspectors would have found a broken smoke detector, exposed wiring, missing fire extinguishers and other violations. One tenant said the problems dated back years.

But Niemeyer said those losses, which are based on unverified reports from ranchers, are exaggerated. "To paint this picture that the whole livestock industry is under siege by predators is grossly misrepresented," he said. "There are individuals who sustain losses, but not everyone."
By state law, the state budget must be balanced, an especially tricky task this year with a projected shortfall of $8 billion. Kasich's solution to the $8 billion crisis likely will be a mix of the privatization moves, state government cuts, changes to Medicaid, and a forecast predicting some tax revenue growth over the next 24 months.

Now we've managed to spend the month of February talking about birth control rather than jobs. Much of the conversation is unpalatable, between Catholic leaders condemning contraception, Republicans bloviating about religious liberty, Democrats clamoring about sexism and political donor Foster Friess telling the ladies how to prevent pregnancies with aspirin. It's tempting to tune the whole thing out. However, at the core are serious questions about the scope of federal power, namely:
But the Yankees have not been buried by their poor rotation work this season to a large extent because of their excellent pen. Cory Wade, Boone Logan and Rafael Soriano have been very good. Robertson, though, has been arguably the most dominant reliever in the game and Rivera has been, well, Rivera — and the compliments don’t get better than that.
Each presidential rival used a fresh jobs report to bolster his own campaign's economic narrative. The Labor Department gave mixed results for April, saying the economy added 115,000 jobs, fewer than expected, and the unemployment rate dipped slightly to 8.1 percent, mostly because more people gave up looking for work. People not looking for jobs are not counted as unemployed
A photo on the site shows seven affected homes, labeling each with the family names. Two families have requested that donation accounts not be created for them, so all aid goes to help the five others.
A shot in the arm for Ohio State would be the same for all of Ashtabula, the gray Rust Belt city that has seen population dwindle to less than 20,000 as the coal and railroad industry that once dominated the local economy has evaporated. When Meyer attended St. John High School in the early 1980s, about 500 kids were enrolled at the same time. Now, the school has combined with St. Paul, and still has only half that enrollment.
The lovers, though finely performed, could use some lightening up. The redoubtable René Augesen is loving, driven and intensely focused as the younger, ambitious Elena, pursuing the project as a chance to make her name.

Revenue rose only about 1 percent, to $76.7 billion. Sales at stores open at least 15 months, a key retail indicator because it excludes sales at stores that open or close during the year, rose 2.3 percent, the filing said, missing a goal of growth between 4 percent and 5 percent.

Last week in the O.C., Sarah had a meltdown, Tamra downsized to itty-bitties, and Jim had a "come to Jesus" dinner with Alexis. And Jesus told Jim to tell Alexis to quit Fox 5. Turns out Jim may not be that far off — tonight’s episode may actually signify the Second Coming because Vicki finally admits she owes someone 50 percent of an apology, and the ladies spend the night somewhere other than a Ritz-Carlton hotel. I believe these are the first two signs of the Apocalypse.

World Peace's starting replacement, Devin Ebanks, hit the first shot of Game 3 on Friday night, a 20-footer off a pass from Andrew Bynum. But Bynum missed Ebanks wide open under the basket on a possession that ended with Ebanks missing a jumper at the shot-clock buzzer, and things went downhill for Ebanks then. He made a few poor decisions that helped open the door for a Denver 20-2 run.

"A lot of my students liked the idea that Jill was doing something for strangers," said Dickson, whose class is about halfway through the project. "It's been really fun to see them discover a lot of what Jill discovered in the power of giving, and how doing something that in your mind may seem small can have an impact."
So David Shire, for instance, offered a fairly straightforward version of "Love Is in the Air" (the original, jettisoned opening number from "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum") and Fred Hersch did something similar with "No One Is Alone" from "Into the Woods." Bolcom, in a display of puckish erudition, turned the main melodic theme of "Anyone Can Whistle" into a gentle fugue, fitting it with a bit of "Send in the Clowns" as a counter-theme.

President Barack Obama said Summitt is an "inspiration" as the coach who has won more games than anyone else in NCAA college basketball history and for her willingness to "speak so openly and courageously about her battle with Alzheimer's."
If Newell has a signature talent, it's here: an ability to cut to the chase, to strip away the artifice built up around a classic and remind us why the play was important in the first place. To accomplish that, he told me, in his ironically ornate fashion: "I worm my way through the iconography and many iterations of a work. When I did 'Hamlet,' this took me three years. 'Porgy' felt like archaeology. Doug and I picked through layers, the original production, the original novel, the life of (co-author) DuBose Heyward, the Outer Banks of South Carolina that inspired him, the prayer houses that inspired (co-author) George Gershwin — constantly trying to arrive at the place of original inspiration, to what gave the artist the feeling he should do this. Then we translate those findings and bring them forward to where we are now, where the contemporary audience is. That jump forward can seem like we're just doing something to be different, but it's in the spirit of serving the original inspiration."

The study -- the first large analysis of antibiotic use in pregnancy -- concludes that penicillins and some other types of antibiotics were not associated with many birth defects.
The Chiefs, Vikings and Colts could help each other out over the next two weeks, so I'll say the Rams are going to go the longest without a win. They looked pitiful at home against the Ravens on Sunday, and they face a surging Redskins team in Week 4 before an open date, followed by the Packers. Maybe the Rams will beat the Cardinals in Week 9 or the Browns in Week 10.
Christie countered that politics has always been a part of judicial nominations, and it’s "just laughable" for critics to argue that suddenly "politics is coming into play for the first time in the pristine 60-plus year history of the ... Supreme Court."
Though controllers always aim for accuracy, mistakes can happen. In the event of an error, "the Air Force has forms that they've made up for us to use," Royal said. "We fill out the form depending on what kind of incident it was and channel it up to our supervisors."

Finally, the tax is difficult to assess, frequently disputed and sometimes subject to litigation. Unfortunately, under the Senate plan, municipalities will still have to compute the value of personal property in order to qualify for their limited reimbursements. For the assessing communities, this is an all-pain, no-gain scenario.

I think that anti-doping is trying to do its best to clean up not only the sport of cycling, but all sports.

Both work well, but the flavorings are subtle. And as delicious as a simply smoked turkey is all by itself, you might just want to leave well enough alone. At least until next year.
The narrator of Dylan Hicks' first novel, "Boarded Windows," knows a lot. In a couple of pages, he might cite Goethe's Young Werther on Ossian, paraphrase Gogol, refer to Cartesian duality and songs like "Surrey With the Fringe on Top" and "Ol' Man River," compare someone's hair to Schopenhauer's or Bozo's, and offer a Charles Mingus anecdote. He speaks of a backroom Bakunin and a Lachaise sculpture, quotes Wallace Stevens and Duke Ellington, and uses "digital hegemons," "asymptote" and "lachrymatory" in passing. But for all that, the narrator (who is nameless) doesn't know enough. He doesn't know what he needs to know -- that is, where he fits into his own story, which is far too focused on somebody else, a sort of father figure named Wade Salem.
The same idea was true at Agape. The company, known for its sleek bathrooms, opened a concept store in Milan this week and invited 12 craft, design and architectural firms to display their work next to each other in integrated show spaces. This was the Maker Movement à la Milanese.

One thing McGuire and Petersen agree on is the more time soaked levees stay under pressure, the greater chance there is one or more will fail. The consequences of a levee failure depend on where it happens. If one or more levees north of St. Charles fail, it would decrease the level of the Missouri River here somewhat, but take it longer to go down below flood stage.

In the April 22 Nocean attack, someone slipped into the building at night, apparently removing a security camera that films anyone going up to the restaurant. Nocean is on the third floor of a building with several restaurants, including a McDonald's, in an eastern part of Tyre.

Zeidan said authorities are trying to identify the man.

At 563 students, South Lake is one of the smallest middle schools in Orange County. It's also among the newest campuses in Irvine Unified, having opened in 1994.

So I'm always impressed by the stunning creations at events such as the Art of Sand Festival, slated to unfold for its second year Oct. 14-23 at Space Coast Stadium in Viera. Somehow, it won't be the same away from the beach, but "art" is the perfect word to describe the work by sand sculptors who come from around the world to participate.
According to the College Board researchers, students with a combined SAT score of 1,550 have a 65 percent likelihood of achieving a "B-" average or higher during the first year of college.

Nowadays, I mostly try to follow the expert advice. My pleasure in exercise for its own sake barely exceeds my mother's (those darn genes again!), but I enjoy walking and biking. I hang out with friends, like learning new things. I like most nutritious foods, though am not immune to the allure of a big greasy hamburger. I'm "good," in other words, most of the time.

It was really hard to evaluate McCoy due to the shameful neglect of the offense on his watch. But Weeden can make all the throws. McCoy's arm strength was suspect in a dink-and-dunk, tedious offense that was characterized by a long handoff that came up one yard short on third down. Nor was McCoy's accuracy as advertised. In the red zone, kicker Phil Dawson was the "closer," not McCoy.

They gained yards in big chunks and small, with running back Ahmad Bradshaw looking dangerous and Victor Cruz (six catches for 178 yards), once again, making you wonder how 32 NFL general managers let him go undrafted for seven rounds.
For all the heavy issues facing Cyril and Samantha, the film itself has a lightness to it. The music, which usually doesn't make it into Dardenne films in a significant way, is airy, wrapping key moments in hope. The landscape Cyril powers through  both city and country  is open and awash with color with the cinematography by Alain Marcoen, who has shot most of the Dardennes' films.

In doing so, Yahoo snubbed Loeb, who had been lobbying for a board seat along with three allies who he believes have the skills necessary to help Yahoo rebound from its long-running struggles.

it's like a form of coming out. I'm 77. Obviously, age is still more a penalty, generally speaking, for women than for men. One only has to look at what actors are working and what couples look like.

The Portland Timbers figure to be somewhere in that mix, but only five teams from the Western Conference will make the playoffs. As OregonLive.com contributor jonk noted, "being the 8th best team in MLS very well might not translate to being in the top 5 in the West and making the playoffs."
Some officials say market forces are largely to blame for the lack of development around The Rock.

Hopefully if he sticks with the company for a few more years, he'll get another, more serious opportunity.

Eaton Corp. spokesman Gary Klasen said the company has shed 15 percent of its workforce in the past 18 months, and it's hard to say whether the expected federal stimulus dollars will result in new jobs.

I'm calling to ask if anyone else is sick of the cats that sneak into your yard and kill everything from birds to squirrels to bunnies? I'm disabled, so my daughter and grandson have to chase these cats out of our yard, just to have them sneak back in and kill again. My daughter has spent money and worked hard to buy things for squirrels and birds and bunnies. She bought special squirrel feeders so they have plenty of water.

We need to have to control over these cats and make their owners pay fines for letting their cats run loose. There should be a law made against these cat owners.

It would be a shrewd move. Lady Gaga has taken her initial electropop sound as far as it could possibly go. Many of her songs are little more than thumping grooves.

Unlike Katy Perry or Ke$ha, she’s not stuck where she is: she could apply that voice to any style.

Calling the set “2011” was a clever move and a nod to longtime followers: the title grounds the set in the present moment, but it also refers to “11,” the 1989 album that contained “A Girl Like You,” the band’s first Top 40 single.
