Castro saluted the hated United States by opening his prisons and sending over as many criminals as he could. Maybe you remember Tony Montana washing ashore in "Scarface''?

For a fund the size of Maryland's — $37 billion — outsourcing the investment function does not make sense for at least two basic reasons: It would not reduce costs, and it wouldn't guarantee increased returns.

Christians have a long history of speaking of "the world" as distinct from or even in opposition to "the Church." In that rhetorical tradition, the world equals all that is sinful, wrong or threatening, and the Church is where one turns for escape and sanctuary. But is the Church really a refuge?

He said it's good for a club to get early and positive reinforcement of the things they accomplished in spring or, more importantly, on the type of team they believe they can be.

Thanks, Rebecca. And you're right about the transparency. I'm afraid we've gotten so bad about re-electing the schmoes who continually swindle us that the schmoes don't even try to be sneaky about it anymore.

Reconciliation is hardly the only theme of "Cities." Like "Substance of Fire," this play also touches on the subject of Jewish reinvention. (Polly is a Texas member of the tribe who has assimilated.) Politics and the culture wars are an area of fascination, particularly in Polly and Lyman's belief that drugs and loud music have ruined the next generation. And geography plays a huge part in "Cities," whose title comes from a sign on Interstate 10. (Although he says he has no desire to return to Los Angeles, where he spent much of his youth, Baitz says he "came back to knowing the West in writing this play.")

Dear Margo: My husband has custody of his three sons from his first marriage. The boys' mother is an alcoholic, and at the time of the custody battle, she was also addicted to meth. Her current husband shares her addictions. Visitation with the mother was limited by court order to four hours a week, and she rarely shows up. Last year on Mother's Day, after not seeing them for months, she did pick the boys up and took them to a local lake. During the visit, her husband, in a fit of anger, physically assaulted one of the boys. We filed and received a protective order against their stepfather the next day. Since that day, the mother has been verbally and emotionally abusing the boys on a near daily basis via telephone. She calls, drunk, dozens of times a day to tell them they don't love her, that they'll be sorry one day for the way they "treat her." (They are actually respectful, but tired of her abuse, they are starting to stand up for themselves.) If the boys turn off their cell phones, the messages escalate into the hundreds. When she calls to talk to one of us, she accuses us of taking her boys from her, as well as causing her addictions and problems. We spoke to our lawyer about terminating her rights. We were told that as long as she shows up, even if sporadically, and pays her child support (garnished by the state for the first two years when she did not pay), there's nothing we can do. (Though she did lose her job yesterday for regularly showing up drunk.) We cannot make her stop. We cannot make her change. We cannot make her face reality. We can only be there for the boys and try to comfort and counsel them through the anguish. If you happen to have any advice about how to make the situation better, I am all ears. — Helpless Stepmom
The pizzas are all so good, it's tough to pick a favorite, but if I had to choose, one would certainly be that fennel sausage pizza; another would be the egg and guanciale pie. The latter is topped with ribbons of ruby radicchio, thinly sliced guanciale (cured pig's jowl) and a little bagna cauda (the Piedmontese "warm bath" of garlic, anchovy and olive oil). Just before the pizzaiola slips the pie into the oven, he takes an egg from the wire basket and breaks it in the middle. The pizza cooks so quickly in the hot oven, the egg yolk is still molten when you bite into it, flooding the surface with gold.

The malaise spread. Old-line steakhouses in the Ambassador District closed, and the downtown dining scene withered. Much of the promise of the post-Olympics 1980s, when Los Angeles was revealed to the world as a first-class dining town, sputtered and died. Restaurant-hopping Angelenos, who practically invented the idea of dining as sport, retreated to familiar neighborhood dining rooms or to their own backyards. Los Angeles is a city famously divided into a thousand discrete enclaves, and the walls between them had become appreciably higher.

More and more Americans worry that if you move, lose your job, or change your job, you'll lose your health insurance too. More and more Americans pay their premiums, only to discover that their insurance company has dropped their coverage when they get sick, or won't pay the full cost of care. It happens every day.
* The Cardinals defeated Arizona 8-2 on Monday night. But if you were up late, watching ESPN's Sports Center, you would have seen the world wide leader put the emphasis on Pujols' slow start to the season. ESPN has been playing up Pujols' struggles. And it really isn't much different in Pujols' home base; Cardinals fans are stressed over Pujols, who is 6 for 40 with seven double plays.
The chairmen of Barnes & Noble Inc. and its suitor Liberty Media Corp. broke their silence and expressed enthusiasm for potentially working together, but the continued reticence of activist investor Ronald Burkle suggests that the final chapter in the bookseller's history may yet contain some unexpected plot twists.

Joshua Gunter, The Plain DealerCavs rookie Kyrie Irving looks to build on his back-to-back 20-plus point games Friday in Los Angeles LOS ANGELES -- Love Randy Newman. Hate L.A. It's too pretentious, too sprawling, too trendy. Los Angeles on a good day is California's fourth best city behind San Francisco, San Diego and Fresno.
Well, I think that I had never thought of myself as being a manager because I really don't like telling people what to do. I have come to realize that that is not necessarily what being a good manager is. I have a very incredibly motivated, passionate, smart, driven and interesting staff, and for the most part we just decide together what needs to be done. I think we're a lot more productive because of that because people feel a lot of ownership over their work and over their goals.

"It would have happened anyway, but not as quickly," she said. "When I came back in August from summer vacation, I told my relatives that within a year there will be a revolution because all of the elements were there -- poverty, high unemployment, high crime rate and a very high rate of dissatisfaction. There is always a line and after that line is crossed people just won't take it."

The author of "One Hundred Years of Solitude" and "Love in the Time of Cholera" in the 1998 film takes part in a conversation with an old friend.
There's an intimacy that passes when someone drives you from the Eastside to LAX during rush hour. The act of generosity, the panic of traffic and the fact that any wrong turn can lead to a missed flight is almost romantic. Perhaps this is what leads me to tell my neighbor a story about my mom as we drive to LAX. It's the most serious conversation we've had in five months.
Charles Patterson, who lives in Charbonneau, told councilors he opposed the expansion because of the possibility of increased traffic. "If our homes are devalued by a newly industrialized airport across the line in Marion County, what impact will that have?" Patterson said.

"Game Change": Julianne Moore plays Sarah Palin in this TV-movie look behind the scenes of John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. Ed Harris plays McCain and Woody Harrelson plays Steve Schmidt, the McCain campaign strategist through whose eyes we revisit this real-life tale.

The money was delayed for years by the Bush administration, which funded bus rapid transit projects but blocked streetcars.

"I'm happy I wasn't there when it happened. I wouldn't be able to look at it the same way if I had been through the terror of being there, if I had been traumatized," she said. Her thoughts quickly turned to urge people to prepare for an emergency.
No matter how well it's done, "Angels" is still a long slog, and "Millennium Approaches," the first installment, is much more satisfying than "Perestroika," whose uneasy yoking of surrealism and sentimentality fails to convince. But Mr. Newell has made the most of the best parts and minimized the preachiness of the rest, with results that are decisively superior in quality to the Signature Theatre Company's excellent 2010 off-Broadway revival. If anyone remains unaware that Chicago ranks right alongside New York as America's No. 1 theater town, this "Angels" will drive the point home.

In fact, watching "Game Change," it's hard not to wonder what would have happened if the McCain campaign had been earlier and better aware of Palin's true skill set. If they were given more time to make her comfortable in the national arena, to shore up her weak points and broaden her script, she might have ridden that first wave of excitement to become the first female vice president.

The Alice Cooper maze has the longest queue, stretching upstairs and backstage. Head to the lower lot as soon as you arrive at Horror Nights to hit the Alice Cooper maze when the lines are shortest.
The proposal endorsed by G-8 finance ministers aims to speed up vaccine research using a market-type concept that is catching fire in international aid circles: the "pull" program. So far, nearly all the research into malaria vaccines has resulted from "push" programs &#8212 money is given to researchers in the form of grants. The money pushes the research forward. In a pull program, sponsors commit to a guaranteed payment to whomever can come up with an effective vaccine &#8212it "pulls" researchers in by creating the kind of commercial jackpot they could aspire to if they were working on a cure for a more "affluent" disease.

Just last week, however, the House speaker's political action committee contributed $5,000 to Cornilles' campaign, joining several other GOP House members who have given to the GOP nominee.
It's notable that the app is debuting for Android phones instead of the iPhone. In previous app launches, developers would test the water with an iOS app first and then develop for other platforms. The app ecosystem seems to be maturing, as developers better understand the audiences for which they are developing, by platform.
Saturday’s win probably assured the Blue Jays of a top-eight seed and a home contest in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. It also may have injected some adrenaline into the players.

If implemented, the bill would cost about $825 million and serve 40,000 students in 166 chronically failing public schools by its fifth year. It could be a boon for parochial schools, which have been closing in droves because of declining enrollment, but could also force reductions in state aid to public school districts.
øBig Jambox is brick-shape like its smaller sibling, the top-selling retail speaker, Jawbone says. Only this time the brick is closer in size to an actual brick. At 2.7 pounds, it's portable, just not quite like the original. Still, you can easily lift Big Jambox with one hand, transport it to the backyard or to your office where, like the first Jambox, you can use it as a speaker phone. At $299.99 it also carries a bigger price than the first Jambox.
The university alone has some 2,000 students a year, more than half of whom come from out of state. The cannabis expo has been held the past two years at the Cow Palace, but a state moratorium on drug use in state facilities nixed a return, Cue said.

"Only 3 percent of consumer budgets go to gasoline. That's tiny," IHS chief economist Nariman Behravesh told attendees at a conference sponsored by IHS and the National Automobile Dealers Association on the eve of the 2012 New York International Auto Show. "But here's the psychological part of it: They're seeing the prices every time they go to the pump."
Perhaps the atmosphere is simply exhausted. It produced reports of 122 tornadoes Saturday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. No reports Sunday. There is a slight risk of severe weather today to the east of us, from eastern Ohio into West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York. It could be bumpy Tuesday in the Carolinas and Georgia. Otherwise, it should be a fairly quiet work week at the warning desk. (We hope.)
Fish, or yu, is always served because of the Mandarin phrase "nian nian yo yu," which means having a surplus year after year. Whole fish such as black cod or striped bass are an added symbol of wealth.

"I've been the same guy my whole life, in San Diego, and did I back up the talk there more than I have here? Maybe so, probably so," Peavy said. "I'm not proclaiming anything. When I say I want to win and I want that dog-pile with my teammates, there's nothing cocky or arrogant coming from that from my behalf.
At my house the menu is more limited, so I like to pair it with ingredients that have some heft — on a bed of bacon-flavored lentils, for example. And because the salmon is so rich, folding some slightly bitter dandelion greens into the lentils at the last minute balances the dish nicely.
attack is on the rise with the recent return of forwards T.J. Oshie and Andy McDonald. Oshie has two goals and four points in six games since returning. McDonald returned to the lineup in Friday's victory over Edmonton. David Backes leads the team in goals (16), while Alex Steen leads in points (38). Steen has four goals and 14 points in his last 14 games.
Actually, the film isn't so much sent up as is the very notion of adapting it to the stage -- a wry commentary on the current Broadway craze for doing exactly that, usually to disastrous effects.
"You have people right up against the exit lane," Cate said, referring to secure and non-secure areas shown in the video being separated only by a rope. "In most airports, you have a corridor. But Newark doesn’t have room. They need some low walls to create an exit, so you don’t have people behind a taped barrier."
Coach Frank Vogel likes to have time to think and puts up his thoughts on a board before calling in his players to watch videos. In the shadows of the fieldhouse, a scoreboard is updated by hand and a small army puts on a show for the fans.

Now, see, I'm not sure that this is such a good idea, despite the official blessing. Of course, the Israelis are way ahead of us in certain matters; perhaps I am just being narrow-minded.

Lauryn Hill, member of the Fugees, South Orange native and critically acclaimed singer-rapper, headlines a show tonight at Caesars Atlantic City.
For some people, a milkshake simply isn't worth the calories unless it's chocolate. Moonstruck's cafes exist just for them. The half-dozen flavors are all intensely chocolaty even though they're made with vanilla ice cream. While peanut butter, cinnamon, chai and root beer are all tempting, cooling Mint Tingle trumps them on hot days. It's like drinking an After Eight mint with crunchy bits of honeycomb candy thrown in to keep things interesting.

Let me be clear. I'm all for losing those 10 pounds. Hell, make it 20 if you want. I'm all for getting fit, feeling deeply healthy and alive in all parts and flavors of your skin. But the equation is violently perverted if you're more willing to suffer the indignity of walking around with a feeding tube shoved down your face than you are to simply re-evaluate how you approach food and exercise, or to earn a profounder understanding of beauty and health. But maybe that's just me.
"Voters sent the message that Clackamas County isn't Portland, and it's time for some fiscal responsibility," Holladay said. "The county commissioners need to figure out how to use the money they have wisely instead of just tossing it around for the next green sustainable project, bikes and bike paths. In Clackamas County, we drive cars."
He also noted that the government has not entered into any agreement with Madoff about his plea or sentencing and that the filing of the charges do not end the matter. "Our investigation is continuing," Dassin said.

"To be honest, we didn't even expect to be here," Pusch Ridge coach David Towne said. "So it was one of those magical moments where we just kind of peaked at the right time near the end of the season and just kept that momentum going. That was really exciting."
"To say that we as a state are doing enough to ensure financial fairness in natural gas extraction is a flat-out lie at this point," said Hagan. "What we're asking for is a pittance."
I thought the chip shot was one of the best shots I hit all week, really. It was a pretty tough shot. I had to get it up the hill and get it to stop on the same level as the hole. It had just a hair too much speed, but I gave myself a putt at it.
Phillip R. Snider awakened at Legacy Emanuel Hospital eight days ago and tried to crawl out of bed. That's when he saw that the bottom half of his left leg was gone, his right leg shattered, one arm broken in two places.
I’m sure Valve has their reasons for creating such a service, but let me make a bold prediction: a day is coming when they will be sunk. Take a look at what comedians Louis C.K. and Aziz Ansari just discovered. They released their most recent comedy albums directly through their own websites. You paid them a fair price directly, and they gave you their product to enjoy as you saw fit, asking that you kindly not pirate or torrent it. This is not unlike when Apple finally gave up on DRM for the iTunes store.
David Hasselhoff is recovering from alcohol poisoning after daughter Hayley Hasselhoff -- sister of Taylor, the home video auteur who infamously recorded dad half-dressed and drunkenly eating a burger in 2007 -- discovered him unconscious Saturday at his Los Angeles area home, according to RadarOnline.com.
The Casino Bar, Club Bar and library seemed right out of a British country house, with dark wood paneling, fireplaces (faux, of course), wing chairs and comfy sofas. The Casino Bar's only awkward touch was the wall of fake books behind the piano, the imperfect illusion fully blown when it was opened to control the room's electronics.

Sherif said she had been told that the flights might not be able to get airborne as quickly as they do now. Currently, the helicopters are supposed to arrive on top of Children's Hospital within 12 minutes to pick up a medical team. Helinet makes hundreds of flights for Children's Hospital each year.
A homeowner in the 3500 block of Chervil Drive reported Nov. 7 that someone entered his Infinity SUV, which had been parked in the driveway, and took a laptop valued at $3,000 and an iPod valued at $300. He was unsure if the car had been locked. There were no signs of forced entry.
The boy, who was charged with the delinquency count Monday after police were called to an elementary school in the suburban Cincinnati village of Elmwood Place, also told police that some boys "stuffed him in a trash can" about a year ago, police Sgt. Kevin Vanover said. Vanover said that incident apparently was not reported to police.
Obviously that pace is going to slow down; I would be surprised if, in the end, this team eclipses last year's total of 162 homers. But it now appears that they can match last year's runs-scored total of 762; they're currently on pace to score 909. The lineup's performance so far has allayed some of the concerns I had about the offense entering the year.
Social Security Commissioner Michael J. Astrue said in an interview the agency was completely overhauling its electronic services in recognition of the greater computer skills of future Social Security recipients and the need to more efficiently process the coming flood of applications.
I doubt we will see him in a Rockies uniform in June, but he could rejoin the starting five in early July. That will lead to a decision on who De La Rosa replaces in the starting rotation.
David Whitley, The Sporting News: "The city of Chicago has a history of drinking problems. Theo Epstein has arrived to sober things up. The Cubs' new president says late-night partying will no longer be tolerated. Hangovers are not part of the new ‘Cubs Way.' . . . It's easy to paint this as "Untouchables II," where a naive do-gooder tries to tame America's insatiable thirst for booze. People are questioning how the policy will be enforced. They say grown men should be treated like grown men. They obviously aren't familiar with Carlos Zambrano. If you want to be treated like a grown man, you need to act like one."
Belleville East's Anna Galius won the pole vault with a leap of 10-0.
It has nothing to do with the quality of the writing. Potts is one of the best travel writers to emerge in the last decade. Intrepid and thoughtful, he's a Paul Theroux for the backpacker generation, and "Marco Polo"- mostly a collection of articles he wrote for various magazines - reflects this.

The career arc that carried Lewis from a pioneering woman instrumentalist in a male-dominated genre to becoming one of the most valuable players at Hardly Strictly Bluegrass and brings her to the Freight & Salvage Coffeehouse in Berkeley, Saturday, Nov. 29, extends back more than 30 years. She co-founded of the all-female folk and bluegrass band Good Ol' Persons (with Kathy Kallick and others ) in the mid-1970s, led her own Grant Street band, collaborated in the one-off all-women Blue Rose project (with Cathy Fink, Marcy Marxer, Molly Mason and Sally Van Meter), and recorded such solo albums as "Restless Ramblin' Heart," "True Stories" and "Seeing Things" and duo recordings with her partner, mandolinist/singer Tom Rozum, who is also a key member in her most recent project, the all-star bluegrass quintet known as Laurie Lewis & The Right Hands (with guitarist Scott Huffman, banjo player Craig Smith and bassist Todd Phillips).

Among the early winemakers was Lyman J. Burrell, who in 1853 settled with his family on the summit where today's Burrell School Vineyard stands. Burrell donated an acre of land to build a school in the late 1860s.

None of these ideas is particularly new. St. Louis' fragmentation has been bemoaned for more than a century, yet countless efforts to unify local governments have failed.

I know how hard it is to plaster a smile on your face and say goodbye to your child right before a beloved holiday. The pain is physical, as if someone carved out a big chunk of your insides and then asked you to make like a court jester.

We could have stayed and watched these magnificent animals all day, but then we wouldn't have visited Bwindi Community Hospital.

I recall writing a story during the playoff run in January 2008 about how Manning was using the pump fake to his advantage. He was really doing well with it, especially in the Tampa game. He brought it back on one play Sunday — a 17-yard pass to Pascoe. Manning pumped toward Nicks on the outside and that sent Curry scrambling to help out, leaving Pascoe wide open. Let’s see if Manning notices that on film and remembers to use such a weapon moving forward.

"I'm always looking for something new, something exciting," he says. "You want to have as many countries represented as possible, and you want a good mix. You can't have all dark and depressing dramas. I'm constantly moving things around and dropping things in. It's like Tetris. It was a lot easier to get films you liked 10 years ago.

"Mostly what it's going to do is drive some number of immigrants to other states - I think it will be a pretty modest number of people, but we'll find out - and give Arizona the reputation as the state that took the lead in what will become known as American-style ethnic cleansing," Sharry said.

Many young children - and I include myself years ago - have awakened during the night to hear their parents arguing about money: where it went, how it was spent, what they can't do because there isn't enough money. Parents find a solution - whether they cut back, or take a second job, or work longer hours. They know that they can only borrow so much before they reach the limit.
