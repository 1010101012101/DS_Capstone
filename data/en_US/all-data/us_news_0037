By the time the stage-hands finished powdering David Lee Roth's parquet dance mats, the Verizon Center started to look a little more like the sold-out venue it was. Beer salesmen moved fast. Spirits were high.

And it would help with his third big challenge—defense. Team Romney is now turning its big guns on the former senator, who has benefited by staying above the Romney-Gingrich fray. The Santorum folks are betting Mr. Romney is getting a reputation for slash-and-burn, and that this will hurt him. He is, and it will, but the attacks won't stop.

He wasn’t entirely blameless. He allowed a leadoff double to Jose Bautista and hung a breaking ball to Edwin Encarnacion to give up a one-run lead in the sixth, but it probably wasn’t asking too much for Gregg to retire the No. 9 batter and keep the Orioles in the game.
Instead of teams playing each other twice, the league is emphasizing regional rivalries and in-conference play to cut down on travel. Teams will play teams in the same conference three times instead of twice and play out of conference opponents once in 2012.

But in 1997, he said, the league invited players to attend an NFL-sponsored seminar on financial responsibility.

Afghanistan has been mostly out of the headlines the last few months, in part because its winter freezes most fighting and in part because it's been overshadowed by the Arab revolutions. As warmer weather brings back both the war and the debate over policy in Washington, the starting point could be summarized this way: Thanks to the U.S. military, the Taliban has been driven out of most of its southern strongholds since last summer.
Samuel Williams, 36, of Garfield Heights, owes $35,673 for his 18-year-old, $21,111 for his 14-year-old and $19,723 for his 10-year-old. He appeared in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court and was released on a $1,500 bond. He's due back in court May 14.

Peña has to head back — now — or she risks ditching the chopper in the sea. But she can’t go until the door is closed. It takes all the strength Downham and Oyler have to bend the body and get the legs inside.
The news accounts of Nieves's respect for the law suggests that she will be back in court again after her six-month sentence as a repeat offender. Two more months in the jail wouldn't change that.

One good source of money may be selling individual stocks. Many investors hang onto stocks because they don't want to pay the 15 percent capital gains tax. But Slott says the likelihood of a coming boost to that rate makes it doubly sensible as a way to pay for the conversion. "You'll never see a rate as low as 15 percent again in your lifetime, I don't think," he says. The top capital gains tax rate is currently set to revert back to 20 percent next year.

But Greg Elwood of Winchester, Va., who worked 29 years as a controller before retiring last October, said he feels FAA should have two controllers on duty for the same reason airlines put two pilots in cockpits when a single pilot is capable of flying the plane alone -- it's a safety hedge against the unforeseen.
Why? Maybe he doesn't feel any different -- normal with "silent" conditions like high blood pressure. Or maybe taking pills makes him feel old and sick, when he sees himself as young and strong. Or maybe he thinks the BP reading was wrong. Or he doesn't believe it's as bad as the doc says. (It is.) Or he's afraid of side effects. Or he's just suspicious of prescription drugs -- some people are.

There are several authors whom I consider favorites, but there is no one else who makes me as happy as G.K. Chesterton does. At risk of sounding like someone's grandmother, G.K. Chesterton is delightful. I assign that word not only to his writing, but to the man himself. He was clumsy and almost pathologically absent-minded. At 6'4" and almost 300 pounds he was a conspicuous figure, but seemed to determined to be more conspicuous still. He usually wore a cape and crumpled hat, and carried a swordstick in hand. G.K. Chesterton was the sort of person who couldn't help laughing at his own jokes, a weakness less forgivable if his jokes weren't so consistently funny.

So, if this can really be the end, the Is-Eli-Really-Elite Debate had a nice eight-year run. It started nearly from the moment he was drafted (Is He Worth Trading Up?) to his early seasons (Is He As Good As Philip Rivers?) and survived even through winning a Super Bowl. It was rekindled when, in a rare brazen moment, he lumped himself with Brady during an August radio interview.

Mt. Hood Skibowl, the resort where I was skiing when I crashed, is owned and run by some thoughtful souls. Because I can't ski again yet, they arranged to cart me around on a snowmobile. And at my request, they took me to my crash site and described what they remembered about the incident. (Thanks to Kirk, Hans and Troy for making this possible. And if you can afford to, go ski for me. It was all too quiet up there. The mountain is saddled with this economy, too.)

While the federal government requires banks and mortgage companies to disclose interest rates and total payments on loans, the financial aid letters sent out by colleges are often unclear about how much families will have to pay. The format for packages varies by school, making it difficult to comparison shop: Loans and grants offered by the federal government are lumped together with the school's scholarships, and the statements often don't include information on interest rates.

I'm about to sound like an old man yelling at a group of kids to get off my lawn, but flag thrown on Rice today was one of the most ridiculous flags I've seen in a long time. And I would say that just as quickly if it happened to Larry Fitzgerald. In fact, I have no real problem with the unsportsmanlike penalty called on Bernard Pollard. But what Rice was flagged for was absurd.

"There are two things I would like to see in this country. First, I would like to see a 10 percent tax for everybody, even the corporations, across the board.

One year, a nurse pulled one of our volunteers aside. There was an infant who was critically ill. The baby was not likely to live very long, and the parents were keeping vigil by his bedside.

I don't know if this is some sort of hardball political game that routinely occurs. Maybe this is political leverage in action: We'll do something dastardly with regards to your project unless you do something nice with regards to one of our projects. Otherwise it seems weird to change the entire game plan with the legislative session already in overtime. Especially since there appears to have been some ongoing progress.

A fountain might sound like a surprising addition when you're thinking water conservation, but even though recirculating fountains lose some water to evaporation and splash-out - the East Bay Municipal Utility District estimates that about 1 to 4 gallons per square foot of water per year gets lost to evaporation from pools - it still uses a lot less than the water lost to a large turf grass lawn, and the pleasure that people take in the sound of water can be well worth the trade-off.

The Irish called whiskey "uisce beatha," which translates to "water of life," and by the 19th century U.S. distillers had cooked up a whiskey niche of their own, with corn-based concoctions making Kentucky's soul as much about bourbon as horses. The combination of grains and distillation methods has evolved over time and fashion, and even the spelling - "whiskey" or "whisky" - might provoke a barstool battle. Now, thanks to craft distillers, the water of life can come in many flavors, proofs, bottles and barrels - and even frozen. Here's a round of sites for experiencing the spirit's true spirit.

Should teachers have the freedom to lead private lives we may not all agree with? And should they be able to post controversial tidbits on social networking sites? Jonathan Turley, a professor of public interest law at George Washington University, believes that they should.

This grew only more heightened once the first part of "Maus" came out and Spiegelman had to complete the work. "Maus I" ends at the gates of Auschwitz — its own kind of dead end, since, he explains, "it was impossible for me to imagine life in the death camps." Besides his father's memories, there were few useful sources; one was Tadeusz Borowski's "This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen," a 1959 story collection Spiegelman admired for its "chilled, camera-like eye, as if Raymond Chandler was not the sentimentalist he is but had been in Auschwitz."

He includes numerous impersonations, from fellow actor W.C. Fields to various members of his famous family, including Ethel and Lionel, but all of it seems like a digression. Barrymore's unseen, offstage prompter Frank, the excellent Sean Patrick Nill, continually and unsuccessfully tries to get his boss to attend to the task at hand. Frank's insistence and annoyance almost kick-start what would be dramatic action, but Barrymore is too crafty for that, and he deftly slips into another self-deprecating story.

Beyond the City Hall infighting, Adams had other political forces working against him. Both Adams and bikes had become lightning rods. At the time, Adams still faced the threat of a recall, and bikes are a wedge issue, often pitting liberals against conservatives.

• As The New York Times' Jake Appleman pointed out, James had to shake off foul trouble to ultimately beat the Knicks in the fourth: "'I’m not a guy that’s in foul trouble a lot,' James said. 'It was difficult for me to sit in the third.'... Before the fourth, James scored a modest 15 points, missing 6 of nine shots, and committed seven turnovers, more than double his season average... As the crowd routinely and profanely serenaded him in the first half, James struggled, and a makeshift Knicks lineup gave the Heat fits."
A: Arborist McMahon, who is also Desert Botanical Garden's resident cactus expert, says that smaller saguaros can still be rather tender in the full sun in the summer here. He suggests that the plant's terminal received too much light this summer and the tissue was burned. Usually, the plant will form a new bud at the top and resume growing. You should put a small piece of 50 percent shade cloth over the top next summer to protect the growing tip. Do not try to remove any dead tissue. Just let it resume growth on its own. You may not see any activity until next spring or summer, so be patient.

The opposite also is true. For example, Martin Scorsese's "Shine a Light" was good and I like the Rolling Stones, but would have been far better had Mick and the boys provided more personal access.

It sounds very big. I'd like to leave a legacy where some of my students — I won't say all — have love and respect for our music. That's a fundamental thing I'd like them to understand, not just a way of making a living or a lot of name, but go deep into music and keep it alive. To keep an age-old culture with its depth, its feeling, its whole aspect is not very easy. Because now especially the world has become so commercial — it is do it now as soon as you can, make a name, make a record. So whether it is classical Western or Indian, I think it has the same problem. It's hard in these modern days to have students who have the love and respect for the tradition.

Falsani’s argument, supported by a landslide of reprinted tweets and quotes from interviews, is spelled out in her book "Belieber!," which was published earlier this year. She did not get to talk to the heavily guarded Bieb himself, but documents long conversations with his mom, who is deeply religious and eager to present the young pop star as a singer of faith. "Belieber!" hints that there’s been something messianic about Bieber’s sudden rise to fame, and implies that there’s more to his straightforward lyrics about young lust than it appears.

At the time, I worked in downtown Portland and usually I commuted by bus. I believe the light-rail system is beneficial in several ways. It helps the environment by getting some cars off the road. It helps relieve traffic congestion and is convenient for people to use. That's all good stuff. But is now the right time to implement such a huge and costly ($1.5 billion) project with government agencies and schools claiming multimillion-dollar budget shortfalls?

The poor Red Sox must have felt like they were facing two aces today. First was the Verlander who relied heavily on his slider as he went through the Red Sox lineup. Then came the Verlander who complements his high-90s heat with nasty curveballs. He threw two straight curves to Red Sox shortstop Mike Aviles in the eighth inning that were so good, they were almost offensive. Aviles somehow managed to hit the second one for a soft lineout to shortstop. I might give Aviles some All-Star votes for that.
And Quenioux, a Frenchman who has been cooking in Los Angeles since he replaced Joachim Splichal at the long-gone Seventh Street Bistro in the 1980s, is at the center of transgressive-food chic. The menus at his late Bistro K and Bistro LQ were thick with exotica such as duck hearts, jellied blood and Mexican ant eggs, and he often presided over long dinners built around black truffles or shot game. His pop-up at Starry Kitchen has been a good one. If you were going to trust any chef with a nine-course dinner built around a marginal herb, he would be the guy.

Highly publicized drug-cartel killings in Acapulco's tourist zone, a hand grenade in a popular Guadalajara nightclub only a block from the upscale Hotel Fiesta Americana, and muggings and shootings near Mazatlán's cruise port are signs that tourist destinations are no longer insulated from the drug-related violence wracking Mexico.

Smith: Again, I want to be really, really disciplined about making budgetary commitments absent knowing what's happening. I've done that consistently. The criteria I'd use -- where are we getting our best R.O.I., where are we getting our best bang for the buck? And where are the areas with a high benefit, where we seem to be underinvesting, relative to similarly situated cities? We are right now underinvesting in the arts. That doesn't mean in a down budget we can promise to spend more -- we can't even promise to spend the same if we are cutting everything -- but we should keep in mind that we are not investing enough. The other thing I'd add is that we shouldn't limit our thinking to our ambit of control. We also need to consider our ambit of influence, that the mayor has the ability to work with regional partners and other local governments to help build the whole pie. The mayor also has the ability to go to Salem. The fact that I'm the one current elected official in this race and the only candidate who has served in the Legislature will be an advantage to leverage other partners so we can build and maintain overall arts funding.

Lubanga, the head of a rebel militia that fought a devastating ethnic war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, on Wednesday had the distinction of being the first person convicted by the International Criminal Court, a decade-old institution that has been in equal measures an inspiration and a disappointment for human rights advocates. The guilty verdict is a milestone for the court that also marks the first time an international trial has focused solely on the recruitment of underage soldiers, which is forbidden in global treaties but is usually lumped in with other war-crimes charges. The successful prosecution of Lubanga — for enlisting boys and girls under 15, drugging them, putting them to work killing his enemies and using them as sex slaves — will set a precedent useful in future trials (including a trial of Kony, if he is ever captured).

The result, critics say, is a nutritional education system so politically influenced that it is ineffective.

Bullying of those who appear to be different from the group, and especially those perceived to be weak, is a sad and sorry state of the human condition. It has existed across the millennia, across most cultures, and is often celebrated in America today in such forms as celebrity gossip and sleazy reality "entertainment." While we decry each publicized act of bullying, we turn our backs on a much larger cultural context, ignoring the slippery slope that often leads the most aggressive among us to seek approval from a group, or revenge against a perceived enemy by physical or verbal acts that hurt.

No. The worst that could happen if all cooling stopped is that the fuel would melt and fall to the floor of the containment vessel. The containment vessel is designed to hold the hot fuel in, but the type of nuclear reactor in danger at the Fukushima plant —General Electric Mark One boiling water reactors — has been widely reported to have a vulnerability in its design that would let the fuel burn through the floor of the vessel. If that happened, radiation could spread through the environment, but on a much more limited basis than happened at Chernobyl, where there was no containment vessel and the core contained graphite that burned, dispersing radioactivity widely. A massive plume of radioactive smoke and ash could spread from the site, exposing people for miles away, depending on the wind and weather.
