TV scriptwriter Ivor Baddiel, who was also on the Storywarp panel, added: “In Stephen King’s book On Writing, he describes exactly that. He thinks stories are like archaeological finds. You unearth them and then you chip away at them until you get them back to their perfect state. And there is something in that. Sometimes, when you’re writing, you know that you’ve found what’s right. If I’m writing a gag or a line or whatever, I’m scrabbling around for it in my head. And, more recently, I’ve learned to listen to my gut feeling more and sometimes it just pops out of the ether. It might not be completely, fully formed but that’s as right as it’s going to get, maybe.”
Writers have produced great work in the face of things far more stressful than the school run: being shot at, in the case of Wilfred Owen; being banged up in jail, in the case of Cervantes or John Bunyan. Yet that pram is lodged in our imaginations, like a secret parasite sucking on our juices.
My mother was always calm in these situations—I don’t know how she manages that, because I am prone to freaking out a little bit when my children are upset. But she never did.
And yet somehow somewhere something was neglected.

Big Top Rock at Teatro ZinZanni is the perfect venue for the bands of Seattle’s Kindiependent music collective, and the sold-out Oct. 8 show with Johnny Bregar & the Country Dawgs and Recess Monkey was a thoroughly captivating trifecta of fun. There are two more shows in the series, coming up on Oct. 15 (Caspar Babypants and The Harmonica Pocket) and Oct. 22 (The Not-Its! and The Board of Education), and I highly recommend you check them out. Underscore highly.

The bottom line is that I have an exact vision of what I want, and it's enough for me. (And thankfully, T, who has just been the right amount of agreeable with what I say and offering opinions when he needs to.) But sometimes I pause and I wonder what everyone else is expecting, and if what is enough for me will come up short for them. And then I feel badly for thinking that this carefully selected group of people, people I love dearly, people who have seen me through some of my worst days, would be anything other than happy to celebrate this day for what it is.
For those who have yet to see this epic flick, it's a chick flick sorry, it's about regular girl Andy, who dreams of being a professional journalist, getting a job at high end fashion magazine runway and working for the dreaded Miranda Priestly; who is anything but! Hilarity and good times afoot! As she works her way up the corporate ladder she begins to change, but for the better or worse?
You can with everything in your power try to make other people happy at the sacrifice of your own personal happiness. Don’t do it because you will feel like a failure. Trust me been there got the certificate and shredded it. Why? You can’t because it will never be enough for some people. They will want more and when you don’t deliver they will stab and ridicule you? You have not failed, you are just trying to control something that’s not yours to control. Your personal happiness comes into effect, when you realize that your personal happiness does not depend on someone else’s. You can listen to other’s ideas and take what coincides with your plan but you be the deciding factor.

So its 10:00am at the beach (the acceptable time to start drinking beer in my opinion..or at least bloodys) and you go prepare the beach cooler. You lug all your towels, chairs, toys, magazines out and place your cooler in the middle as a nice cocktail table. And two hours later and four sunscreen applications you realize your beer is warm.

She had a point, but spending my free time making a doll to send to six foot two inch Junior didn’t sound like much fun, either. My husband, Cornelius (I call him Corney for short) was gone for the weekend on a police consulting job in Philadelphia. I had other plans for my free time. Like power shopping. I tried to change the subject.
Gary Giordano, district manager of CB 5, echoed the sentiment that state involvement is a good thing. “Whatever the technicalities of classification are, speaking for myself, and I think for some board members too, I’m hopeful that with the state DEC being involved, there is more of a likelihood that the reservoir basins will remain in very much a natural state,” he said.

So you look for comfort wherever you can find it. One thing I can tell you is you do NOT paint boats. You paint horses maybe, which make you feel happy and grounded and safe. You stretch the corners of your seven by two to include a few brushes and a canvas panel or two, and wait for the orbiting to stop. As you settle into your space, the other bodies inside the flying saucer settle too. All the other fourteen square feet stop clashing and start meshing, and pretty soon there is some stretching out, some repose, some relief. The puzzle pieces come together and everyone puts their elbows away, the wind calms, and when you look up you’ve added a psychedelic seasick horse to the menagerie.

Also, in my experience, the term “severe autism” is commonly used as a justification for why autistic people not only can but must be treated in ways that would be instantly recognized as unacceptable in any other population. This includes lowering or discarding very basic standards of science and ethics, a pervasive practice now applied to the entire autistic population. I am referring to the basic standards of science and ethics that automatically protect and benefit nonautistics, and without which they could not proceed safely in society, much less have good outcomes.

The Brosnan Bond films did a solid job of plugging the Bond franchise into the contemporary political scene and CASINO continues this trend. Bond’s killing of the bomb maker causes all sorts of grief for M (still played by the awesomely bad-ass Judi Dench) as his assassination makes the papers back home. M is furious at the duplicitous nature of the lawmakers who want results and purposely don’t ask about their methods, and furious at Bond for being so stupid.

I decided to take a ‘leave of absence’ from my job so I could try to break the code. Maggie didn’t know of my scheme and still thought I was going to my usual nine-to-five. We would get ready in the bathroom together, walk out together, take the same Transmilenio bus only about 800 meters from Plaza Bolívar. When she would have to get off at the Pepe Sierra stop I would kiss her goodbye, wish her luck at work, and instead of getting off at the next stop to go to work I would simply get off and go back on the Transmilenio but on the opposite direction back home to La Candelaria. Then I would get to work. I felt like a private investigator or a spy. It was invigorating. She was never the wiser since she was accustomed to me being at home earlier than she.

It’s okay to like more than one thing. It is! The only really issue for me is time and money. Honestly, I wish there was a way I could squeeze everything I like about both games into one big gooshie lump of a game-y thing-a-majig but I can’t. So now I find myself in the awkward position of not knowing what to do or what to play. My TOR subscription is set until July, and I hope to have heard SOME kind of news about the Mists release date by then. But until then, it’s hard to play anything without getting my innards all in a twist, and when I can’t play – well, I have a bit of a struggling writing about it.

A thought about the Grim reaper argument occurred to me, and I wanted to quickly jot it down to see where it goes.
A good name brings honor to Christ’s church, while a bad name brings reproach upon Christ’s church. “When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach” (Proverbs 18:3). Ignominy – shameful behavior. Reproach – disgrace. I cannot engage in disgraceful behavior without bringing disgrace upon the church. Others (beside ourselves) are affected by our reputation. “The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him” (Proverbs 20:7).

The pieces would not easily slide onto the 2"x2"s, so I had to (gently, gently) tap with a rubber mallet to get the pieces onto the wood. See the groove marks the piece is scratching into the wood? Those are from little nubs on the inside that are supposed to help the plastic piece(s) grip the wood tightly. It's doing a dang fine job.

As UK police arrested a 15th person yesterday in connection with the Newscorp Hackgate scandal, accounts filed in the US show that Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch’s total compensation rose by 47% to $33.3 million in the 2011 fiscal year. In what must have been one of the most humble days of his life, Rupert Murdoch boosted his own pay still further with an eye-watering $12.5 million bonus….and $8.5 million in stock awards.

So the fact that Tripel Karmeliet's nose first brought to mind bologna for me isn't as disgusting as it might sound; I immediately wanted to call the beer "Best Bologna Beer." Then a sip brought a wallop of bready notes, not unlike you'd get from a good lager. After this the character changed with each sip. The second sip brought sugar, the third pepper, and the fourth bananas. After that, the taste alternated between sugar and apples.

I so love that this red and white horizontal striped chair is living in this space. It's so preppy, bright and fun. I also think it compliments the black and white buffalo check and stops the space from looking too country.
Lions of the West presents short biographies of eight men who were integral to the process of America expanding west across the North American continent. Kari and I chose to discuss each man in-dept over the course of a few weeks. We started the discussion here with the chapter on Thomas Jefferson. Below is our discussion of James Polk, a president neither of us think we would like much at all. We hope you enjoy the below discussion and that it piques your interest enough to delve more into American history and understand the complex relationships that existed, and continue to exist, between so many different cultures.
It connects to our master bath steam shower on the other side of the wall. It’s been hiding under my work table for several years now and while I knew perfectly well it was there and had no problem with the pan on the floor being under the crib (we rarely use the steam, it’s rather quiet, and very little water vapor actually manifests), I neglected to remember how big the unit is farther up on the wall, how wide it is, and how far it sticks out. It sticks out 7 inches. My crib has a slight sleigh back but not that much. If I set the crib out 7 inches from the wall not only would it look weird, but it would stick out in the room awkwardly. Hunh.

That's me, Thanksgiving 1986, a proud(?) member of the Debutante Club of Mississippi. Hated the hair, hated the dress, and my face looks like a Moonpie in this picture. The rose floating right next to my my head -- it looks kind of freaky, doesn't it-- is actually attached to my dad's tux --- but I am saving him the embarrassment of being pictured on my blog. The long white leather gloves, however, were really cool; unfortunately, being rawther expensive, they were lent to a friend of the family the next year and were never returned. Hidden by the gloves are about 5 inches of those Guatemalan yarn bracelets that were all the rage.
Now I may be old fashioned but these “tools” (even the word “tools” sends shivers up my spine), to me, sound like what used to be called living, relating, or the decisions that generally just fall into the category of being a human being. Maybe the technical language might be “common sense.” I wondered, do we really need a power point presentation from a mommy blogger/expert to tell us to call our children when they are free to come to the phone?

Originally consisting of eight families that immigrated to the region during the Turkish-Egyptian rule in the 1870s, the Jewish community remained relatively small (it never exceeded 1,000 members) and was primarily concentrated in the capital city of Khartoum. Sudan’s Jewish population grew primarily via immigration, mostly by Sephardic Jews, and many individuals found success in commerce and in administrative positions within the 20th century British colonial government. Anti-Semitism was relatively rare – the community never faced danger during World War II, and a special arrangement with Catholic schools offered educational opportunities for Jewish youth.

What my husband loves about any Star Trek isnt the technical sci-fi side, he's always watched it for the moral values and deep characters. I have to say the DS9 is even less technical than TNG. DS9 is really mostly about the characters and their lives on the station. So many episodes are deep in moral values, heartwarming or just plain fun. A lot of tearjerkers if you ask me. To top that off most of the show they are deep within a very deadly war and you do see the dark side of war.

Virtually every nation with a minority population is heading in the direction that has destroyed the financial sovereignty of America.

Fast forward 14 months to February 2012, and remember that NAMA has now examined 95% of the developers’ business plans, according to the NAMA chairman last week, and remember these business plans are required to disclose details of asset transfers in the past five years, and in the Dail yesterday, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan told the Fianna Fail finance spokesman Michael McGrath that NAMA had now succeeded in reversing €160m of transfers – in other words an additional €30m when compared with December 2010. The €160m of reversed transfers represent 31 developers. Minister Noonan says there are another 17 developers being pursued. The Minister is reported to have said that NAMA is pursuing five “cases” through the courts for the reversal of transfers – it’s not clear if this is five developers or just five legal actions, remember that NAMA has initiated legal actions in Canada, the US and the UK against the Grehans, so there could well be “five cases” there alone. There are pending legal actions inIreland against Sean Dunne and the directors of Capel Developments, but it is understood that these are related to judgment orders, rather than reversals of any transfers. The David Daly case did have an element of spousal transfer of cash, but David Daly has now refinanced his loans, so that is no longer a NAMA issue presumably.
Oh, and now that I am thinking about it, maybe I take back those rude comments earlier. When you think about it, having a tingly peepee is a damn good thing, right?
How is it that all this happens in plain sight and with the passive acquiesence of democracy and equality-loving Canadians? It is because it is in their vested interest to criminalize every aspect of our lives so that Canadians can continue to enjoy the benefits of stolen lands, resources and power. Hunting and fishing has been our traditional means of providing for our communities since time immemorial - now doing so can land us in jail, or worse risk being shot at or run over by enforcement officials. Similarly, preserving the balance on our territories and making sure the land is cared for in such a way that it continues to sustain us and our people seven generations into the future - can land us in jail.

I never heard of Lisa Scottoline and I decided to do some research. She wrote a bunch of books. She was from the Philly area. She wrote some funny columns for the paper. She seemed down to earth. She had a new book called Save Me coming out in a few months. I emailed her my story about how I took my Mother-in-law to a book signing but not my mom and asked her if she could help. I never heard back. I emailed again. Nothing.
Let me tell you, it was WINDY. Which made it incredibly COLD. Thankfully the registration was indoors, so Chris and Ryann hung out in there until closer to when they thought I'd be finishing. I did a little warm up jog, and then made my way to the start line. I filed in behind a group of people wearing Garmins, figuring that I might be able to use them as my rabbit. Pacing is one of my worst skills. Finally I got up the nerve to ask how fast they were planning on going... 9:30's. Well crap, that wouldn't work. They shooed me to the front of the pack and said good luck. My Garmin still isn't working, and my dumb phone wouldn't pick up the satellites, so I just had to gun it and pray I didn't go out too fast or too slow.
We have been hard at work on our cabin. We finally have the foundation logs put in, though it’s been too damp for the concrete to cure properly, so we can’t anchor them in quite yet. We have to notch one more log, then fell, skin, place, and notch another, then we can start laying the floor. After that, we get to build the walls. We are still living in our tent, though the campsite looks more like a tarp city at this point. A couple other family members have tents set up for when they get a day or so to come help. There’s tarps over each tent, and two large tarps covering the area in the middle. We are trying to button up camp while not taking away time from building the cabin. Typical autumn weather is making life a bit colder and more difficult than we might otherwise prefer.
I try to look at the bright side and am happy to be able to get up and leave my desk on the dot of 4 to get back to my little one on time. I am glad for the relaxed routine as it allows me time to do things that I can’t do at home such as engage in social media, read news or update my blog.

Southbound. California Highway 1, along that spectacular piece of our planet called Big Sur. This particular February day was sunny with some ocean haze screening really good looks at Grey Whales migrating just off-shore. We stopped frequently to admire vistas, examine flora, search for geocaches and, of course, look at birds. Raptors can abound along the steep slopes bordering the eastern side of the road, and that day we saw numerous Red-tailed Hawks of various color morphs. There were Kestrels, a few Cooper's Hawks and a Sharpie. But we kept our eyes on the high ridges, scanning for The Prize of the Day. We'd had reports that three California Condors were being frequently seen along a particular stretch of Route 1, soaring just above the ridges. Every once in a while a distant Turkey Vulture would cause our hearts to skip a beat, but as the day wore on, we began to think we weren't going to be lucky Condor-spotters.

How often are we divided over issues of race, gender, and sexual orientation? How often do we hold grudges against past offenders, despise those who have wounded us (either individually or communally), and refused to be reconciled? Is this what it means to be the body of Christ?

They stopped when they were at the place Trent guessed was where the creatures had first appeared. They flipped on their flashlights, searching the root-covered cliff, which rose about two feet above the water. Tall grass was surrounded them like an angry mob, jutting from the center of the patch was a rotting gray branch. The type of natural protrusion he would have used as a diving board when he was younger. Trent tracked the limb with his beam, it lead nowhere interesting.

And, of course, the industry would not be what we know it today if not for e-readers. Amazon, who tends to be hush-hush about sales, says they move at least 1 million Kindles a week. (At $79 a pop, many people found these under the Christmas tree.) In the last quarter, Apple shipped over 11 million iPads. 1.5 million Nook and Nook Colors have sold in the last quarter as well. Morrell says that he believes roughly 100 million people in the U.S. alone own e-readers. But with so many of these on the market, Morrell sees the market reaching its highest levels of saturation this year and then leveling off in the years to come. So what does that say about the future of e-readers? It's a pretty healthy forecast. E-readers and self-publishing have changed the game when it comes to getting published. But in a good way? I'll let you be the judge!

Add to the mix that I am naturally a very shy and introverted girl you have a total social misfit, lol. So, I really do not know if I will ever make friends around this area. Other people seem to communicate so easily and I always just feel like an awkward spectator, not ever really connecting with anyone. The whole thing just makes me so frustrated, if my baby were not with me I doubt if anyone would say one word to me (or me to them.)
Scenes between Jack and Kate did not seem to exist to point out that "look, there's a possibility for romance between the two, and look, sexual tension." They existed to form a bond between the characters of a deeper nature than romantic attraction (deeper, as it turns out, than life itself), and to "plant the seeds", if you will, both for romance and conflict. Jack and Kate - or "Jate", as fans dubbed their relationship, was never simple and their feelings for each other were never straightforward - though feelings between them were always heavy, for better or worse. Their relationship was never about whether or not they were going to hook up, whatever battling shippers would proclaim. Their relationship was about their relationship - not just the romantic aspect. And this confused a lot of people, who did not tune in to the biggest mystery show on television to analyse feelings and relationships, and who were not used to these old-fashioned subtle romances because, as Vogt states, they are so few and far between.

Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune calls the inclusion of The Blind Side in this year’s Best Picture pool “a triumph of the till”. Many critics are surprised to see it on the list. And I suppose for Hollywood insiders and members of the Academy, they know very well what the bottom line is. I’ve heard the argument before: If you want to see indie films and artsy productions, go to Sundance and Cannes. I can hear them grumble … be realistic, the Oscars is a celebration of the movie business in all its glory and glamour.

Near Alan’s home on some rough land belonging to the local builder was a stack of bricks. We busily made ourselves a den in the centre of the stack – a bit risky but we came to no harm. In his back garden Alan’s Dad made him a small sand play area where we would make tunnels and roadways in wet sand for toy lorries, mechanical diggers and the like; the beginning of Alan’s career in building! We were pleased when in early spring it was light a little while after tea so we were able to play out for a while.

We are not dealing with a monolithic bloc, with a single message that TPTB are anxious to get over to us, the plebs. The players in this game are divided and highly factionalised, each trying to sell their own versions of reality, in an attempt to make them come real.
What I do is use my blog to create space around the klesha and slow it down so that I have an opportunity to analyze it–dissect it, if you will. I heard one lama say it is like creating speed bumps for an speeding out of control car (anger) to slow itself down.
“Men!” Molly exclaimed loudly in frustration, imitatin’ other women around town and her justification for the outburst seemed correct to her. A sock on the floor, see, a sock, see, see! Crumbs left on the counter, see! Forever pickin’ up after him while molehills become mountains. And we truly are cherished slobs. Also he wants, um, sex and she wants intimacy. Ain’t the two the same? He asks. Well, ladies and gentlemen, maybe they are and maybe they ain’t, so let’s argue and see where it gits us…‘cept we don’t never talk about such things, heaven forbid. Livin’ under the same roof and never sayin’ what we think. Lucky! What! A stiff dose of medicine for someone who thought he had it down pat, a coup over the dinner table that he didn’t see comin’ as she one put one over on Lucky. Molly, don’t git in one of your weepy moods. To git you in the mood he’d do almost anything. Like breakin’ out the best champagne, givin’ her her favorite flowers, and surprisin’ her with candy. Be game. Roll the dice. Add a little sugar and spice. Do something different. Why not tonight? I swear, why not! Hot and sweaty! Git inside her undies and she’ll love you forever. And talk dirty, if you think it’ll do some good. I’ll never prove that I’m a man of your likin’ so long as you don’t let me try. Not tonight, honey.

The kids got dressed with little to no fuss, even Stella was rather compliant about what Adam had picked for her to wear for the day. They walked well to the bus, they sat well on the bus. Things were looking good. They were happy to go to see Santa, but refused point blank to sit with him for a photo. I will be trying again, I have a photo every year so far, and I will be disappointed if I miss one. I did manage to get one of Adam and Santa, so perhaps that will become the tree decoration for 2011.

Remember when the progressives/Democrats/liberals celebrated Obama repealing the 'Don't ask, Don't tell' policy? Well, since then, sexual assaults on males has increased in the military. Non-consensual sodomy attacks are now 7% of attacks, with a reported 20% increase in male sexual assaults. This is what happens when these idiots don't think the consequences through of their warm and fuzzy ideology that they jump up and down to impose on others. And these are the numbers on reported cases. How many go unreported due to feelings of shame by the victim? And then added to this are the attacks on females in the military which increases every year. The Army refuses to follow recommendations to end gender-integrated basic training as the report found that it resulted in less discipline, less unit cohesion, and more distraction. And of course, more sexual assaults on the females. No matter how they wish it, the genders will never be physically, emotionally or sexually equal. And now added to this mix is the legalising of homosexuality to further encourage in-your-face perverse behavior. The USSR didn't need to fight the US military with their own military - all they had to do was inject political correctness at all levels to do the job for them...I wonder if the Soviets also have such a soft military? But hey, at least the Gays are now happy.

What happens then is that the average for cuts and tax increases is determined for the House. Let's say it is 61% cuts and 39% taxes. Let's say the Senate average is 46% cuts and 54% taxes. Now let's say that Obama goes for 40% cuts and 60% taxes.

This has been a week filled with omens, or maybe not. On Wednesday, I had the fattest rabbit parked in my back yard from dawn 'til dusk, so fat that it looked like a basketball made of fur from behind. I figured it was an omen that I needed to get back to Weight Watchers, but my sister opined that it was like the cows in the dream that Joseph interpreted for the Pharaoh in the Old Testament, and a sign that I could expect a year of plenty. See how smart my sister is? On Thursday, I had two equally fat cats in my yard, and I was pretty sure that I knew what they were up to, so I didn't bother my sister for an explanation, but I figured it was a sign of spring. I sure hope so, because it's not going to be good if I sit inside amusing myself with eating and laziness for too many more months.
I have to admit, that I had seen this man climb over the past year or so in a nearby community to where he is, had been curious about dancing with him even though I thought him rather stuck on himself, but after this crude and rather cruel display, I no longer had any interest in dancing with him ever. I am sure he will never ask me, so I will never have the pleasure of saying No, Thank you. Who knows, perhaps he will go far now that he calls himself a teacher, but I know 7 women whose thoughts of him turned very dark one night, and I am guessing that none of us will ever take class with him, or give encouragement to others to take class with him. It just strikes me as a less than intelligent choice to mock those whom you feel are less than you, and are also your potential target group for teaching.

The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews has grasped the words of Ps 22,23 and taken them well to heart, when he says of Christ: “For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the congregation will I sing thy praise.” Heb 2,11-12. If any worldly lord were to condescend so low as to say to a thief, or a murderer or to a low French character, Thou art my brother; that would be a great thing and everyone would be amazed at it; but that this King, who in his glory sits at the right hand of God, his Father, says to a poor sinner: Thou art my brother, that no one takes to heart, no one receives it in earnest, and yet on that hangs our highest comfort and courage against sin, death, Satan, hell, law, and against all misfortune, both of the body and of the soul.

On an aside, simply because it is too funny to not include (after all, this blog is for Rylie,) I was talking to her teachers again about placement for next year. Rylie will be in a pre-K class rather than a 4s class. Some logistical and curriculum differences, but for all intents and purposes, all of the kids go to Kindergarten the following year. More just bout the structure of the class. While it appears to be the right place for her, I am a little nervous because I have heard the teacher is a very strong personality. Kids either thrive with her or have a horrible year. I won't lie- I am nervous. I asked her teachers again that this is their recommendation.
I am trying to cultivate humor so that I don’t turn out to be a single-grey-note writer. I’m not planning to add slapstick to an otherwise serious story; nor am I planning to use a lot of clever quips and one-liners. They get annoying after a while, and overshadow the plot. A touch of quiet humor works just as well and makes readers (or film watchers) let down their guard so they are more susceptible to deadly thrusts.

To get myself started, I made a list of recipes to get to during 2011 (my "50 for 2011" list) and shared it out with my Facebook friends. They then, in turn, requested updates and that the recipes be shared as I worked through them. I tried sharing the first couple of recipes (that very same week - yes, quick turn-around, but remember school was canceled for a week and I was bound to my house), and, well ... decided perhaps a blog would be a better way. I mentioned the idea to a few friends, and they whole-heartedly encouraged me to start a blog. I wasn't yet convinced.

One Saturday in the wintertime I was all set to go somewhere but remembered something just as I walked out the door. I got side tracked for I don’t know how long. Then I heard off in the distance this cat yowling. I thought to myself, “awww, someone’s cat is really lonely!” And then I was like, “that sounds like Winsor.” I turned around and saw that I hadn’t latched my door all the way, so it opened all the way up. And in my old apartment the door would close off half of the apt. when it was open. So he must have gone to get some food and water or use the toilet and wandered out into the hall.

Until, very very recently, I found out that my relative had gone back to his drug habit. He had spent nine months in a residential treatment center. Every member of our family had had long talks with him, loving talks, shouting talks, begging talks. He promised to quit, did for a while and relapsed. The clan was currently trying to summon me back to the island hoping that my presence would bring home to him how dire his situation was to his own life.

But Callista brings a couple of things. One is a tremendous artistic focus. She’s done a video in music education, why it really matters. She’s a pianist by background, plays the French horn in a community band, sings in the choir of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. She really cares about the arts and would bring a really strong feeling for music education and for art, and why it matters to people as part of their education.
In the Loeb Edition of Josephus there is a lengthy footnote on this story. A few scholars have drawn attention to the fact that the debate between Ananias and Eleazar reflects the two schools of rabbinic thought in the first century, that of Hillel and Shammai, with respect to circumcision. In Talmud Yebamot 46 a there is a description of a Rabbi Joshua who taught that only baptism was necessary for a Gentile convert, and the Rabbi Eleazar who argued that circumcision was necessary for the Gentile convert. J. Klausner argued that the dichotomy between Joshua and Eleazar is similar to that of Paul/Barnabas and Peter/James (as suggested by J. Klausner, From Jesus to Paul (1943), 39-40), but this may be reading the Paul / Peter relationship as a strict dichotomy alá Bauer.
Now of course the above is very much a simplification. NAMA’s assets may not correspond to general commercial and residential forecasts – where is development land for example? NAMA will have 7% or so of assets in the Rest of World. NAMA’s LEV as a percentage of CMV may change. So far this year in Ireland residential is off 5% (to the end of Q1) and commercial 8% (to the end of Q2) and the UK is broadly positive, so we have some way to drop before we get to the EU benchmark scenario. There are other assumptions but it is a fair representation, I believe, to say that we are overpaying by billions for NAMA loans by reference to current values – some overpayment was planned via the Long Term Economic Value device but the overpayment being referred to here is on top of that.

3. Sunflower Farmers Market -- This chain of markets has been around since 2002, but they just opened a new store right up the street from a HUGE new Whole Foods store in Trolley Square. Frankly, I'm not sure how Whole Foods will complete, except on the convenience factor since Trolley Square is a bit of an upscale mall. And, they really are the place to go for good organic produce in the valley. However, I was very impressed by the variety of organic, vegan, and vegetarian packaged food options at much lower prices than Whole Foods at the new Sunflower Market. Next time I'm back in town, I'll have to check out the Murray store, which is much closer to where we stay.

This will just be a rambling post. Just blogging mostly for something to do. Trying to find things to keep me busy. It is time to take the flannel sheets off the bed now so I am washing all the bedclothes and comforters today and going back to our linen sheets. It will be nice to feel their cool softness when we rest at night. Dail was never too fond of the flannel sheets anyway but they were a big help during the cold nights of the winter. I am just waiting for Kailee and Mike to get done with their stuff so I can use the washer and dryer. I hate having to wait when I'm finally in the mood for some house cleaning. Nick is going to help me out I think. I used the last of my allowance to get him some batteries for his radio so he has been extra nice today. Not that he isn't always helpful but he appreciates it when we do something for him. He is busy on his computer game but he has taken time to help me out. Our bed is king sized and it is difficult to make it up alone. I will get him to help me when we are ready to make it back up.

Broccoli: looks like trees, tastes like butt, right? Yeah, I used to think like that, too. But in high school, Ma ordered Chicken and Broccoli from our local Chinese joint, Da How. Suddenly, it was broccoli: looks like trees, tastes like HEAVEN (with garlic and brown sauce). Sometimes, a food is more appealing when its paired with flavors you’re not necessarily accustomed to. Like bean sprouts on top of Pad Thai. Or peas stuffed in a samosa. Or tomatillo sauce spread across an enchilada. Pick a cuisine and start experimenting.

No, I don’t. Naomi Klein mentions this practice in No Logo, how more and more companies, starting with retail, do a daily end-of-the-day bag check to make sure the workers aren’t stealing anything. Inherent in this practice is the knowledge that workers cannot afford many of the items that they sell. It happens more as inequality worsens. And now, it seems like they are just as concerned with employee theft as customer theft.

I didn’t respond, my nerves were getting the best of me, I had to stay strong. I remember almost pushing the suitcase under the bed and calling it off.

So, somehow the dream shifts and we are in some kind of seminar about keeping yourself safe, as well as child development. I am there with a couple of my colleagues, some old friends from back in the high school and college days, and a couple of students. Somehow, I am back on campus in the town where my parents retired, also where I went to school. I am feeling guilty because I have traveled all this way for the seminar, but have not gone to see my mom. My BFF keeps reminding me that it probably isn't the right time to squeeze in a side trip, how upset my mother gets when I do visit, and how hard it could potentially be on me. So, I acquiesce to simply taking the BFF and one other person on a quick tour of campus before we all pile in the cars to head back to NY.

Beneath her jaded disposition festered an undercurrent of resentment toward God.

Anyway, while I'm working out/sledding, I watch something. Preferably, a show that will make me pine for the next episode, so that I'll be motivated to work out again.
Click over to Astley Clarke and revel in their stunning jewelry collections. Some are pricey; others are not. It's not possible not to find something you will like. (I know, I had to read that sentence twice too.)
That's it for now, must dash, this weekend alone I have orders for four orders of gift boxed red and gold Wedding Collection Cupcakes!

We tell polite fictions to our children.
Right now I wanted to let everyone know what was going on and that I have a lot more reviews and giveaways to come.
If you sincerely seek to know the truth about Jesus and to do what He says by reading through the New Testament with an open mind and heart; and if you sincerely try to live by its principles in your life, yet nothing begins to change you and to convince you of Christ’s reality, then I believe you have a legitimate reason to reject Him.
Do not touch that last paragraph. It's perfect.
His books are — like Amanda Hocking’s — all published in e-format. So he is an expert in the self-publish world.
My sandals are from Target (because that is sometimes how I roll) and I love them because they are yellow and comfy. They were also the shoes I wore for my first date with S so I have a fondness for them.
Bake cookies, one pan at a time, 14-16 minutes or until lightly browned. (Refrigerate the remainder of dough until ready to bake.) Cool on pan on wire rack for about 5 minutes. Then, transfer from pan to wire rack to cool completely.

things kinda calmed down and I fell asleep in his arms, the next morning was jordans memorial service, we went and although my husband held me and comforted me, i knew something wasnt right, after jordans service I followed him onto the front porch confronting him about what was wrong.
However, Hifindaka and his colleagues still don't know what the object is or where exactly it came from. They've contacted NASA and the European Space Agency for help, AFP reported.
I cut two circles out of white printer paper and then two slightly smaller ones out of some black contact paper (yup, I still have contact paper left after all this). Black construction paper would work just as well.
About three days after my initial posting I had already formed a reasonably clear picture in my mind of what could possibly have happened on that fateful day. However, considering that the police have not finalized their investigations yet, I don’t think it’s a good idea to be overtly forthright at this point in time, especially if one takes into consideration that there is a 15-year old juvenile involved, whose rights have already been shamelessly violated by the media, and who has already acquired the services of legal representatives to protect his rights.
There is also the small matter of worse health due to being a person of size. This ends up costing the NHS, basically the taxpayer, money. In a stunning little headline grabber, some unnamed “Health Boss”, whatever a health boss is, has suggested that overweight people of all ages be given slimming shakes and diet food. This, the reasoning goes, will save the NHS money in the long term and will be cheaper than gastric bands and the like.
I hope you remember Leontien, my virtual friend who moved from the Netherlands to America to chase her dream of owning a dairy farm. She and her husband Bastiaan have the dairy farm, and it’s very near the site of the Limberlost, made famous by Gene Stratton Porter in her books. Unfortunately, just as all Leontien’s dreams were coming together, she was diagnosed with melanoma.

In a perfect diabetic world, you take your insulin, eat your meals and exercise and your blood glucose levels remain stable. But things happen, you take your insulin late, you eat a light meal and then spend all afternoon running errands. This is a recipe for hypoglycemia – a condition when your blood glucose levels fall dangerously low.
I was on a stealth mission to Los Angeles to clear out my apartment.
This passage comes to mind as I ponder the words of this wonderful old hymn:
WhatDoYouMeanByArt will remain the name of my Etsy shop, but the blog, poof, eventually deleted from blogdom forever (as soon as I can get the merging thing figured out lol).
One day we were talking about the common people, the little people—people that we label as the masses: labourers, farm hands, servants, and even snake charmers, and how they have become too powerful, dangerously powerful, in India these days.
Silent witness and executioner.
The solitary time lasted about two minutes before my parents came up. Of course, they fell in love with her right away, as I've heard grandparents are prone to doing. (My dad had a pulminary embolism a week or so before she was born, hence the oxygen in the picture.) Around that time, they came in for a second glucose check...which she failed again, by only two points. Bottle number two. Ugh.
He stood and left the tavern, walking slowly, the precious book under his arm. I followed him into the fog.
The patterned papers I chose for the pouches are all from the My Mind's Eye Bloom and Grow collection. To fit my cookies I started with a 7 inch square of patterned paper. The "Diet starts tomorrow..." sentiment cracks me up and it seemed like the perfect sentiment for a little cookie treat!

I used an old kit from TSS here with mostly GCD studio products. I used a scallop border punch to trace the "bite" marks on the border pieces and then cut them out, inked the bite marks with a black marker and the paper edges with a purply-red color. Added a few embellies, traced around the title to help it pop and we're done. :)
But I think part of that is so that we learn to take joy in the everyday again, something that we have forgotten. If we don’t take joy in what we live, we start to lose that connection, that reverence and awe for the world and the gods.
To make the sponge: Remove your starter from the refrigerator and stir to incorporate any alcohol that may have collected on top. Remove 1 cup of the starter. In a large bowl, combine the starter, flour, sugar and buttermilk. Cover the bowl and let the sponge sit at room temperature overnight.

Oh 4002, I'm gonna own one of you! Oh 4002, why did I do that to you? Oh 4002, did I break you?
My goal, then, is to break the back of that before the end of Wednesday. Given how much time I have available in the next two days, even 12,000 words should only be around 600 words an hour, which is about what I do when I'm struggling with chunky stuff. That leaves 5 days of 7,500ish words a day of action and adventure (and one very surly nun) to get me to 50k in 7 days. Tough going, but nothing I've not managed before.

What led me to believe that Lionel was the note-writer was my recollection that he had captained his school bridge team. His participation in the on-board tournament seemed a virtual certainty, and I quickly confirmed as much with the catering staff. This left me in no doubt that he was the culprit. Reasoning that he would surely wish to share the details of his ingenious deception with his young fans, I made a series of unannounced visits to areas of the ship where the children tended to congregate. I eventually found Lionel in the video arcade, reading something aloud amid a cabal of his giggling admirers. They dispersed as quickly as motes of dust in the wind when they saw me approach, but I snatched the note from Lionel’s hand before he could trouser it.
Up until that moment, I believed that all the problems at AMP were unintentional, and that there wasn't a chance of dishonesty on the part of the owner. But that, when considered along with everything else, made me suspicious for the first time. After that, we couldn't believe Ms. Hicks when she told us she'd paid for something. So we began to monitor the bank account...It was then that we starting noticing some peculiar activities in the AMP bank account.

Once the girls got a whiff of the dog treats, they began dancing around and performing every trick they know (even though I didn’t ask) to try and get it. It was hilarious so you know I have to show you.
They’re all wrong. Yes, the slapstick is there, along with the groans, pokes, thumps, and the like. But the TV show never mocked nuns or showed infants urinating in the face of the Stooges. The film does.

So when you hear Democrats today like Patrick Kennedy comparing the Arizona with the Trail of Tears, note that they’re merely trying to pass the buck for their own Democrat historic racism to innocent Republicans. I mean, what Patrick Kennedy did was analogous to Osama bin Laden saying, “You Americans are the terrorists, just like the murderers who attacked and destroyed the World Trade Center!” But wait a minute, Osama – YOU’RE THE ONE WHO DID THAT!!!

i wonder if she’d even want to.
Yawn! I always thought I was a morning person, but the last couple weeks have been hard on me. Riley Kate decided to go out for volleyball this year. After I agreed and she's all signed up and excited, I find out that practices are in the wee hours of the morning BEFORE school. I have noticed that the trip into school is getting darker and darker. When practice first started it was starting to get light outside. Now it's DARK! The only other creatures I have found awake at this time are skunks, possum, raccoons and DEER. I learned after the first couple mornings to allow more time for the drive and take it slow. I don't want an antler hood ornament.
Well, I hope you all have a fantastic day! Remember to share the love. I'm going to take my 7-year-old daughter into my craft room and cook up something crafty! I've totally been inspired. I will be back on later with our creations and bring you some pictures of what we created.

On the first day the town is something of a blank slate. The first changes to appear are the zoned off, infected areas where all hope is lost. In these areas the disease is rife, the houses are boarded up and infested with looters, the streets are choked in miasmas and smoke and the dying claw at you for salvation. These areas shift in location from day to day, and have an enormous effect on your actions. Simply traversing them is both a heartache and a risk, and without a weapon and good protective equipment (galoshes, gloves, heavy cloak) you’re going to need bandages, medicine and painkillers for yourself when you emerge out of the other side. Course, you need those same medical supplies to ease the pain of those dying in the zones, which is one of the only ways you can keep your reputation up. Decisions, decisions.
I got right up next to her face and phone and started singing The Star Spangled Banner at the top of my lungs.
I am also in the works with a new blog. I was inspired to do a prims on a budget one after changing lifestyles and moving. I wanted to share some of my ideas and ways of getting the prims you want without spending a fortune. I will let you know when it's up and running.
No thanks, I think. I’ll stay in this Worser One.
Before we left on the trip, it was agreed that whoever was driving would control the music. Since Cpt. Delta and I used to prank each other a bit, I carefully selected a few cassette tapes that were calculated to irritate him.

We know that AQAP has long sought funding from Saudi Arabia. But the media haven’t done much reporting on that, focusing instead on Saudi regulatory improvements. Why are we only hearing about Ibrahim Saleh Mujahid al-Khalifa’s Saudi connections now?

A disclaimer, before I go. Borax is natural and biodegradable. It is NOT NON-TOXIC! Keep your wonderpowder locked away from your pets and children! There are some cautions out there about using it on dishes and cutting boards as it can, in LARGE QUANTITIES be harmful to the digestive tract and kidneys and also to the male reproductive system. My advice: don’t eat Borax in large quantities. Rinse things well. The 1/2 TBSP you put in your dishwasher that gets rinsed with 6-10 gallons of water (the amount used in an average cycle) is probably just fine. It’s going to be much safer than the paraben-loaded stuff sold commercially. Borax does not know the difference between a weed and a plant that you are hoping will thrive so keep it on the sidewalk cracks and far away from your garden. As with anything, use common sense! After all, that’s what grandma would do.
I didn’t want to go to school, so I started moaning and groaning and told my mom that my stomach hurt (I was really hamming it up!). She said she was going to take me to the doctor’s office because I sounded real sick. Well, we get to the doctors and I pretend my stomach hurts and wince or moan when he touches me (I thought I deserved an Oscar!). He pulls my mother aside and talks to her for a little while. They come back and the doctor pushes my side and I react right on cue and he says, “See, it’s appendicitis and we’re gonna have to operate”. Wow, I wasn’t expecting that! I jumped up and started spilling my guts! I said, “It doesn’t really hurt me I was just pretending. I didn’t want to go to school!” All the while crying because I’m scared to death they’re going to cut me open! They just looked at me and said, “We know.”

Coming to the recipe, this ones from my mother-in-law. For a chocolate hater like me, this pudding-like cake did wonders. And by that I mean, I could manage to eat a cup full, that's it. Mamma made it last year when we were in India for her chocolate obsessed son, but guess who enjoyed it more?- the daughter-in-law. The thing is, I enjoyed it way too much to not touch it for one whole year. I binge eat anything I like and then end up hating it with a vengeance. This recipe was jotted down and brought back with the hope of making it to my blog in 2011, but the thought of all that gooey chocolate put me off. Its only today that I had this craving for something warm (trust me, a brioche bread pudding topped the list), and since the ingredients for this chocolate fudge cake was readily available, I went ahead with it.

And for many of us, tribe is something fragile. Something which some far distant business man in a suit sitting in an air-conditioned office has declared to be of ethnological interest, anthropologically endangered, linguistically moribund, or simply primitive. Something which may not endure another generation, if great care isn’t taken to preserve its present nature. Why these things need preserving, I’m not quite sure. It’s like when city-dwelling folk see a tribesman using a cell-phone and think how terrible it is that Western culture is polluting the simple ways of the native peoples.
-“NO, anxious, YES and worried that we won’t get there on time and annoyed at you for asking me if I’m nervous for the tenth billionth time.” I replied while rolling my eyes. I’m pretty good at looking annoyed. He got the picture and fully exploited it on film.
After I wrote about the issue at Total Wine, it didn't take long for me to be contacted by the people running things. In fact, they contacted before I even realized it. The Business Development Manager, Rob Hill started to follow me on Twitter, and attempted to contact me by posting comments om my posts.

The next several days were very touch and go. It took a plethora of tests to figure out what was wrong with him. He had been striped of so many capabilities and he was in severe pain. He couldn't even speak our names. The doctor told us, "If he makes it through the next few days, he will have very limited speech, as well as, fine motor skills."" WHAT???," I'm thinking. "Why would God tell me he needed to draw a cross if it's never going to happen?" It saddened me to realize that this piece of legacy would not come to fruition. Oh ye of little faith...

In recalling these events, Didion returns to certain flashes of memory again and again. Quintana's wedding, with its peach colored cake from Payard, cucumber sandwiches and pink champagne; the stephanotis woven in her braid; the bright red soles of her Louboutins visible when she knelt at the altar. She recalls the fried chicken eaten from a friends' fancy plates to celebrate Quintana's christening, the Chanel suits the women wore and the cigarettes they smoked, the hotels they stayed in when they traveled: the Kahala and the Royal Hawaiian in Hawaii; the Fairmont and the Mark Hopkins in San Francisco; the Ambassador and the Drake in Chicago.

*The Private War of Mrs. Packard: The Dramatic Story of a Nineteenth-Century Feminist by Barbara Sapinsley. This totally sounds like a book that I should be blaming Ana for, doesn't it? :D But truth is I'd never heard of it before. Here's a bit of the blurb from the back:

1991: No worldwide web (outside CERN); no text messages; no PDFs; no InDesign (1994); no Quark 3.3 (that was when it became real). We had email, of course, and the Internet for moving stuff. The book I published in 1991 was written (I think) on an Acorn Archimedes and delivered as a plain ASCII text file on a disk, with a paper print out. The book I delivered yesterday was written in Word, sent by email as a .docx file, and if I suggested posting any physical objects the publisher would think I'd gone mad.
In the meantime here’s the recipe I’ve used for these:

On August 01, 2011, the German Press Agency (DPA) reported that U.S. drones fired missiles at a vehicle in the Barmal area in South Waziristan, Afghanistan, along the Pakistani border killing at least four civilians and injuring scores others. The identities of those killed are still unknown.
Thinking back to the years of assigned reading, I recall that it took me a long to wade through A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway. Part of it was the length of the book, part of it was that it required a bit more concentration and I felt like I needed the “ideal” circumstances to read and understand it (it was for an AP English class and I was going to be tested on it, so I felt like I needed to pick up every detail in case it was covered on a quiz or test) and a bit part of it was that it was an assigned reading book.

(2) Perhaps it was because of the attachment I developed for Dr L, and therefore they did not want to risk me developing the same kind of feelings for another female psychologist. Initially I worried this could happen in my own mind, as I do seem to develop an attachment to female staff members (teachers, doctors, other professionals), as well as Dr L, my old GP before I moved here who was especially supportive during the darkest times of my mental health and especially when mum was ill. I was horrified when I saw her at the gym once with me stuck in the outside pool, and she comes strolling along and starts swimming like an Olympic athlete, I practically ran from the pool inside when I knew she was swimming in the opposite direction! As for Ms Therapist, I admit there have been no feelings of affection for her at all, she does somewhat remind me of Dr L in terms of looks, but she is more talkative and open in conversations and I see her as a psychologist and nothing more. I suspect my fascination and attachment with Dr L was always partly to do with looking for a substitute when my mother was ill! I guess it is the same for CC, she is female (in case you did not know!) but I have not experienced any feelings towards her, I see her as just someone who supports me and perhaps as a friend.

One of the fun aspects of the course has been shooting weekly assignments. Every week the instructor would give assignments and each of the students were left to their own devices to fulfill the requirements. First assignment, we shot flowers. The flower assignment was easy enough. How could it be difficult, shoot some flowers and share them with the class. Next up, portraits. Again, cake assignment. Snap some pictures of people’s faces. Boom, boom, boom. Done. After finishing up the first few weeks of the course I felt pretty confident in my abilities as an amateur photog. Give me a concept to shoot and I am creative enough to come up with something that will both fulfill the assignment and give it a certain flair to make it my own.

Second, it means classes are over. I had my last screenwriting class this morning, and turned in the first 31 pages of my script, revised in places and with a sheet that says I wanted to revise in others but I didn’t have the time or the idea where to start. Overall, though, I’m pretty pleased with it, and with luck I’ll be able to keep writing it, just not for class. That’s two scripts I have every intention to keep writing. Oh, dear. It’s going to be a busy summer.

I will even go so far as to say that I almost stopped watching this movie about fifteen or twenty minutes in. The lead female character Ally (Anna Faris) reads a magazine article that says the average woman has slept with (insert any number here). In a moment of boredom, Ally makes a list of all the men she's slept with in her short single life and is shocked when that number is so much higher than the magazine article states is normal.
My conclusion, to date, is twofold: 1) The deeper principles of karma are so subtle and intricate that a lifetime of skillful inquiry and practice are necessary to begin to near a real understanding of it; 2) Viewing karma through the lens of deep psychology provides a means to approach the question of karma in a user-friendly and practical way.

Outside on our bicycles, we drove cattle all day, down the grasslands of Berkshire Road and through the river of Cedar creek at the foot of the hill. I slipped climbing the creek bank and Jeff caught me by the arm, pulling me up onto the grass. We reached the apartment building patch-of-grass-Ranch by late afternoon. We were tired, having driven five hundred head a hundred miles in one day. Our knees were grass stained and scraped. Our sneakers were muddy. The saddle packed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches from lunch were long gone and our stomachs grumbled.

9. A New Aristocracy Of Labour, argues that the sociological root of some of the Statism of today's Left stems from the fact that so many of them are dependent upon the State in one form or another, and that the predominance of the organised Labour Movement within the State Sector constitutes a new aristocracy of labour similar to that analysed by Engels towards the end of the 19th Century.
In his What Is Intelligence?, James Flynn discusses some of his ideas as to the forces behind the famous effect named for him, the Flynn Effect. (And before I go on, I'll say that probably only IQ or psychology geeks will find the book of major interest; there's a lot of really abstruse theorizing going on. Steve Sailer's review will likely tell you all you want to know, but VDare is down right now so I can't link to it.) One of the forces that Flynn reckons is behind the secular rise in IQ scores is what he deems a rise in abstract, scientific (or at least scientific-like) thinking among the general population. (Flynn manifestly does not think that the Flynn Effect implies that our great grandparents were morons.)

But there is something that worries me. I've mentioned before that if every licensee stuck a couple of casks on, that then didn't sell, you'd end up with a situation where cask beer is available everywhere, but quality hugely hit-and-miss. This would undoubtedly turn off the casual cask drinker back onto keg. If your going to spend £3 a pint, you want to know your going to get for your money, quality wise.

I just knew that somewhere on his drive home from the Big City he had stopped to find the magazine.
During his lifetime, Lewis published several other volumes of essays that were more unified; the two most well-known of which are probably The Abolition of Man, which is an argument against 20th century educational models, and The Four Loves, which is a literary study of the four types of love in classical literature – affection, friendship, sexual love, and charity. He also published three major works defending the Christian faith: Mere Christianity, which was edited together from a series of talks he gave on the BBC during World War II, The Problem of Pain, which was his first apologetic work written in the late 1930s, and Miracles, which was his final apologetic work. He also authored a satirical collection of letters from one demon to another, instructing him in the finer points of temptation titled The Screwtape Letters. (Save the Narnia books, this may well be his most widely read and respected book.) He also wrote an imaginative tale of hell being emptied out and its occupants being allowed into a realm very near heaven – what would happen, how would these hellish beings behave? That book is titled The Great Divorce and it is my personal favorite of all Lewis’ work.

So, my paternal side is originated from Fujian Province, China. Hence Hokkien (福建話) was rung a familiar tone in my ears since the day i was born until i learn to speak the dialect. I speak Hokkien with my family, paternal grandparents side family and relatives. My maternal side is originated from Guangdong Province, south of China where Hakka (客家話) is commonly spoken. Therefore i speak Hakka with my maternal side relatives. Cantonese is the language mainly spoken among the Chinese in the village. Also Hong Kong serial dramas are popular in Malaysia. Not only Taiwanese dramas we like to watch but also Cantonese series. I studied Mandarin at the local vernacular Chinese Primary School for six years. These are the reasons why i can speak so many languages and dialects besides English and Malaysia Language.
It’s not really something I’ve discussed with people, I kind of shy away from the topic when I’m asked how it’s going or how I’m feeling … partially because I don’t want to be reminded every second of the day that the one person I want to spend my time with isn’t here, but also because I’m not sure myself how I feel about it. Just like any relationship, I have days where I don’t think it can work; I have days where I’m certain it should be over, that we should both just walk away before we hate each other. Then there are other days where I’m confident that distance means nothing when you love someone even half as much as we do … I don’t know what answers right or what answers wrong but I do know the only answer I can stick to is the one that involves us ending up meeting at the end of the alter.

Lockout, in many respects, feels like a love letter to cheesy, old-fashioned action filmmaking. It’s an idea brought to us by EuropaCorp’s Luc Besson, probably one of the most beloved action filmmakers in French cinema, who has been responsible for several well-received action films in North American markets as well, among them Taken and The Transporter. The premise comes off as a bizarre experiment to combine the cliched action movie playbook with shards of a backdrop that you might see in a video game plotline, and the result, much like the lead characters, are full of seemingly heterogenous parts that somehow come together into an appealing whole. I normally really enjoy Besson’s films, and as such, I was pretty interested in Lockout, finally going along with a friend I hadn’t seen in a while to see what the fuss was about, in hopes that it would also start warming me up for this Fall’s release of Taken 2. The movie was scorned by many critics, especially considering its tendency to borrow ideas from other films like it, but I decided to treat the movie as a hommage rather than a derivation, which I think was the intended direction that the filmmakers were trying to go with. Even if the movie comes off as a clone to you though, there’s still enough parts of it that work to make it a light, breezy watch if you’re a fan of action B-movies. Even if several of the plot elements are indeed derivative, they’re saved by a script that’s sharper than you’d probably expect, as well as the lead performances of Guy Pearce and Maggie Grace, which are better than they have any right to be in a movie like this. Budgeted at a microscopic $20 million, Lockout has a very limited amount of resources to work with, and you need to manage your expectations accordingly if you’re interested in seeing it. If you can do that though, the movie will probably entertain you more than you’d expect as long as you’re willing to let it do so. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again; I’d rather a movie was entertaining over wholly original, and Lockout may not be the latter, but it manages to be the former. Yes, it’s pretty disposable, and I doubt it will have the lasting value of much of Besson’s best works like Taken, Leon or La Femme Nikita, but I’d be lying if I said that I wasn’t repeatedly amused throughout Lockout’s runtime. Granted though, this is because I didn’t take the film too seriously, and frankly, I don’t think it wants to be taken too seriously. This is another really simple movie to break down and talk about, at least for me. One of my regular readers actually wrote an incredible post fully analyzing and critiquing every iota of what went into Lockout’s storyline, and how it spoke to her own sensibilities as a writer. She’s very, very talented, because I could never draw that much from a movie this lightweight as far as action films go, especially since she actually managed to justify Lockout actually NOT just being dumb fun as it seems to set out to be. So, I guess there is stuff to analyze here if you really want to look for it, and as usual, Besson exercises his panache for maximizing the potential out of tiny details to make his outwardly low-grade movies more than low-grade. For most just in it for the action filmmaking playbook though, Lockout marks a forgettable, but fun film to scratch your cheesy action fix, should that be a fix you have.

The meeting was the local branch of Coeliac UK, held in a church hall and very well attended. This may have been because there was a food demonstration by Juvela, which always means a) free food and b) other giveaways from this major player in gluten-free retail. I arrived only just in time and took a chair at the back, which unfortunately meant that I was far too close to the horrible children who were at the back because they wouldn't shut up. I felt alternately desperately sorry for their mother and close to battering them to death with a chair. If I hadn't wanted to talk to the dietitian who was there, I really don't think I would have stayed, even for the free food, which I didn't actually get.

That scene, like the one before it, is perfectly believable and totally made up. How impudent of me to turn a man into a puppet - a man who's been dead for a long time, who cannot defend himself. To make him drink tea, when it might turn out that he liked only coffee. To make him put on two coats, when peraps he had only one. To make him take the bus, when he could have taken the train. To decide that he left in the evening, rather than the morning. I am ashamed of myself.

The present Coalition government wants to make those freedoms more real, more practical and more usable – but in a balanced way so that our greatest protection – freedom from harm by others – is properly addressed with open and effective laws designed for that purpose. I don’t see a Coalition government destroying the concept of freedoms. Clegg and his Lib-Dem colleagues are right to insist that this is their red line in the sand. Sabre rattling at election time is all very well, but we live a world of ‘real politik’.

So. What were you doing 16 years ago today? I know there's a few of you who remember. I remember. I had worked closing at the restaurant the night before, and gone out after work with my lovely co-workers/hooligans. Probably got home at a reasonable hour, like 1 a.m. or so. I didn't have to be in until 5:30 p.m. (yes, I remember this). So I was PISSED when Mike woke me up. Because I was tired. Surprisingly, I don't remember the time, but I know it was well before 9:30 a.m. Probably even in the 8:00 hour. Ungodly. Before I could start fussing, which really, wouldn't have been all that bad, he told me. And really, I didn't understand what he was saying. I thought I was still asleep, and that, haha, oh good, I'm still asleep! No one had the audacity to wake me up, because what he just said made no sense, and so obviously I'm not awake. But he just sat there, looking at me, knowing what was coming. I processed. I asked him to repeat. He repeated. I processed some more. I got stuck on that denial stage of the grieving process, because it MADE NO SENSE. We sat there. For a long time. Just sat there. I don't know when the tears started, but they did. And we sat there. I don't know when he called the shop to tell them he'd probably be a little late, but he did. And we sat there. I think we sat there for hours. Or at least I did. I know he went into work, truthfully it wasn't as big a deal to him, but I was, so he sat with me for a while. And I sat there. The phone rang a few times, I couldn't bear to answer it. People were leaving messages, had I heard? Was I going to work? Had I heard about the drum circle that was going on at the river? HAD I HEARD, OH MY GOD, WHY WASN'T I PICKING UP THE PHONE?

It came in a poly mailer that is 100% biodegradable and they offer free shipping with most of their items!
I mention this for several reasons, not least is to credit BORN's director Minnelli with achieving in this scene (with EMA's scoring) what it takes TREE over two hours to do -- see the way cosmic myths descend on us during key moments in our life - and that every moment, in a sense, is key, every breath and touch as vast as a 2001 obelisk, and yet a yellow filmy fog descends on this sense of wonder and dread, so we can get on with business and not waste the day away being awed at a sunflower. And if our every action isn't awash in mythic resonance, who's fault is that? It's the fault of the cinematographer, dictating the direction we look, and how long we look there, and when we decide to walk away, and look again, from farther off, until the final screen recedes and the credits rain down from heaven like an unstoppable flood, and the tree of life is buried once again in a flood of flood imagery.

His brother is less understanding and insists that Rizwan earn a living by selling cosmetics for his company.

It is well to be reminded that under the rule of sinful men there has been a general decline in prosperity accompanied by rising unem­ployment, tyranny, and misery.

On the other hand, nations truly under God’s rule have prospered without these horrors and the old British Empire and North America, at least until the last couple of decades or so ago, were the classic examples.

At 33,000 years old, the Siberian skull predates a period known as the Last Glacial Maximum, or LGM, which occurred between about 26,000 and 19,000 years ago when the ice sheets of Earth's last ice age reached their greatest extent and severely disrupted the living patterns of humans and animals alive during that time. Neither the Belgian nor the Siberian domesticated lineages appear to have survived the LGM.

Yes, let’s not forget that Labour brought in ESA, used ATOS and still haven’t turned their back on this. There’s a long way to go before we have adequate mainstream representation within parliament fighting for groups such as disabled people. Too much focus on those with the money. Corrupt and perverse. Furthermore, there is a focus upon those trying to do the ‘decent’ thing and save up money. What about those who can’t afford to save up money? Those who will have to choose out of cutting down their food or leaving their house because of the housing benefit changes?

Solomon’s request for a discerning heart literally was a desire for a “listening heart.” The implication is that wisdom, besides being a gift to be received, is not a once-and-for-all blessing—it is ongoing and tied to our continuing receptivity, to our ability to continue to listen. We cannot therefore receive wisdom without recognizing our need for it, and to do that requires the virtue of humility. Humility gives us the accurate assessment of our limitations and creates a “listening heart” open to receiving the manifold wisdom of God.

Another said that the people at that location “came out and danced in public on September 11th.” I had never heard about any JF activity in Meherrin before. When the opportunity came I drove up there.

Straigh out of the frozen, hoary wastes of Singapore (home of the equally crushing Abhorer) comes IMPIETY, who you are no doubt fully acquainted and obsessed with by this late in the Satanic-blackthrash game. Formed all the way back in 1990 (Abhorer formed in '87, for the record), these non-pious Hessians have always worn their primitive influences (Sextrash, Sarcofago) proudly on their lengthily-spiked sleeves, as evidenced by their original band name (it was "Sexfago"--lols).

+ Pinterest is the hottest social network right in terms of buzz right now. I had signed up ages ago and when I first played with it, I didn't really get it, to be honest. Then around the end of the year, I poked around a bit more. I'm one of those types that signs up for the beta of anything, only because I want to see what's coming and be aware--even if I don't want to use it myself. I'm always curious to see if there are cool ways for my clients to engage using the platform.

Hands up who wants peace. All those with their hands up, how much time have you spent, how many hours…minutes?…have you thought about ways in which you can do something to create peace? How many hours or minutes have you spent actually doing something to promote? Is it a valid enough desire, a worthy enough cause, for you to spend a few more minutes, another hour maybe, thinking about ways in which you can create more peace in the world and/or doing something to achieve that?
But the Brooks/Barnes points do need to be supplemented again by an awareness that, from Edmund Burke onwards, conservatives have ALWAYS seen some role for government. And protecting the country from outside enemies is absolutely one of those proper roles of government. Outside the anarcho-capitalist camp, even most libertarians would agree with that one. So George W. Bush's post 9/11 security buildup is a very proper conservative thing to do, even if -- as one expects from a government activity -- its execution is hamfisted.
I really love this book! It's clearly organized, thorough, and super user-friendly! The background information in part one lays a great foundation for the practical, hands-on sections that follow. Even though I've been doing some fermenting for several years, I learned plenty! I recognized some recipes from the fermentation ecourse, plus plenty of new ones. There's a huge variety, so there's bound to be something to fit everyone's taste! We love the two pickle recipes we've tried so far, and I have a delicious smelling zucchini relish ready to break into any day. We're really enjoying the ketchup and mayonnaise too. And I haven't even made it to any of the recipes in part 3 yet!

But when you take seriously the existence and malevolence of nonhuman forces that are capable of using “us” as well as “them” in the service of evil, the focus shifts. As the hazy and shadowy realities come into view, what we thought was clear and straightforward becomes blurred. Life becomes more complex, but arguably more realistic. The traditional lines of friend and foe are not easy to draw. You can no longer assume that “that lot” are simply agents of the devil and “this lot”—us and our friends—are automatically on God’s side. If there is an enemy at work, it is a subtle, cunning enemy, much too clever to allow itself to be identified with simply one person, one group, or one nation. Only twice in the gospel story does Jesus address “the satan” directly by that title: once when rebuking him in the temptation narrative (Matt. 4:10), and again when he is rebuking his closest associate (Mark 8:33) for resisting God’s strange plan. The line between good and evil is clear at the level of God, on the one hand, and the satan, on the other. It is much, much less clear as it passes through human beings, individually and collectively.

I saw a ghost in a hallway, and it was hardly my fault. My particular quirks of how I handle phantasms from my past is not something I go out of my way to conceal. And, quite objectively, given my location along a major east-west route through the mountains, it was merely a matter of time.

“M O M!” He was beyond frustrated.
He heads over to Ga Young’s work area and ignores Jung Ah, looking around for Ga Young. He sees her walking to a back area, carrying her lunch. She’s eating when he reaches the area and she immediately stands up when she spots him. He tells her to continue eating as he looks around at the racks. Surveying the area without actually paying attention to it, he turns back to Ga Young, “Don’t bother about me and eat comfortably.” Haha, I laughed out loud at this point! CUTE! Finally, still looking around, he approaches the table and sits down. Finally, he tells her, “Isn’t the rice too much? Give me your chopsticks!” She points out she’s already eaten with them but that doesn’t bother him and he takes the chopsticks, munching down her rice and kimchi. Hehe, I’m smiling! She watches as he eats it all down, asking her who made the rice, the kimchi, why Bong Sook doesn’t cook and finally tells her to start eating in his relaxation room from now on. 0(Oh, that’s what it was!) At her expression, he gruffly tells her, “I’m not there at that time! I always have lunch meetings!” She mutters a yes and for a moment, it seems she’s about to ask for her lunch box back but just watches it. He asks her the final question, does she still come to the company because he forced her. At her no, he’s happy and walks away smiling and satisfied. Behind him, Ga Young eyes her empty lunch box and stares after him with a pout! Hehe!

The north side, on the other hand, is dominated by a copper-clad, beak-shaped balcony, a prow to the “ship of state,” as it were, initially called by Predock the “Armadillo’s Tail,” but now referred to as “The Stinger.” It points towards high-tech North Austin. And like twenty-first century Austin, the Stinger stretches out, ever reaching, aspiring, striving for a future that all Austinites know is free for the taking, floating in that crisp, blue Hill Country sky.

One month ago today, my husband found out that someone else had taken my heart. In one sentence in the middle of a church parking lot, my entire world changed. It is hard to believe that in such a short time period that I would be forced to grow in ways I never imagined. Days would get harder, emotions would run high, and I would wrestle my inner strength.
I know many vegetarians and vegans and while I respect their decision, I believe that our bodies need meat and bone broths and so on - its just the way we are built.

I've got a really great recipe for you today from the Bon Appetit magazine. It was super fast, easy and really great! And my kids gobbled it down! A few of the ingredients are a little abnormal but if you have a Kroger near you, then you should be able to find whatever you need in their international foods isle. On a side note, I used Tilapia instead of Halibut and it was really great.
According to research eating a small bowl of soup before lunch can save up to 700 calories a week. Subjects who ate soup before their midday meal consumed 100 fewer calories and they didn’t make up for those calories by eating more later on. Just make sure you avoid high fat, high calorie soups such as chowders and ‘cream of’ varieties and go for a low calorie, low fat option such as a Thai broth, vegetable, bean, minestrone or a home made tomato soup.

After a week of fun, we all piled in the bus for the long trip home to Sydney. However we hadn't gone far when the engine made an awful noise and ground to a halt. After the adults discussed the situation, we were told that the bus couldn't be fixed out here in the country. We all scrambled out of the bus and sat on the side of the road. Luckily the weather was fine. One of the teachers got a lift to the nearest town and bought a load of sandwiches for us for lunch since we had been there all morning wondering how we would get home, but we were all confident our teachers would solve the problem.

So what did I read? Two very good, new science fiction novels fully engaged my attention: Sleepless by Charlie Huston, an apocalyptic crime thriller set in present-day Los Angeles in which people can no longer fall asleep; and The Windup Girl by Paolo Bacigalupi, a biopunk political thriller set in a far-future Bangkok on the verge of civil war. Both were terrific reads, and I think The Windup Girl is particularly well suited for steamy summer days.

Recently our Readiness Centre had a talent show – imagine 30 preschoolers, toddlers and babies singing and dancing on stage. Little Miss Adorable’s baby brother rocked out in a jolly jumper, kicking and bouncing away. During the performance I sat on stage behind a row of dancing preschoolers. I was there to support and supervise. While everyone danced, Little Miss Adorable managed to bum-shuffle out of my grasp and shuffled through dancing preschoolers to the front of the stage. She had a mini tantrum when I tried to pull her back. Little Miss Adorable made her way to front and centre stage, waving at her adoring audience and doing the dance moves all by herself.

PRIZED introduces readers to an alternative dystopian society where women rule. The stakes are made even higher as Gaia's baby sister is taken away from her. Gaia's decisions may not always be right, but the extraordinary character development she undergoes more than makes up for it. The love square exemplifies the troubles in a society where such a male-female ratio and female ruling exist, while also being entertaining and surprisingly fresh. Readers will relish in this delicious and readable sequel to BIRTHMARKED.

During the DAT meeting last night we celebrated Miss Ethel’s birthday. I think that it were up to her she wouldn’t have a birthday at all, as she was reluctant to cut into her very pink “Queen of Canteen” cake or let us sing that well worn birthday song. With some persistence, Thomas’ wife Susan was able to cajole her into having a piece. Birthday business aside, the meeting was a chance for the NPRC to meet those who might be standing next to us on the next DAT call. We could have been there all night listening to crazy stories from years past, but Miss Ethel was ready to call it an evening after a couple hours. There will be plenty of late night DAT calls to come… except on nights when Al blesses the fire phone.
This year wasn't a real active one in this space and I attribute that to Face Book. Posting at FB became my substitute for blogging, but I've decided to become more active up here. If for no other reason, blogging provides an outlet for journaling and that's a good thing.
One last thought:
*What I miss: Still missing exercising, but also missing be able to go and do whatever I want. I still have to take it easy, and that's not easy for me.
That truth is exactly what I hoped to discover in this project. And when I read it, I thought, but I have done this already, last Autumn, when I came back from such bad health. And I mulled it over in my mind and realized that all my choices and my actions and even my thoughts since last Fall have been slowly turning toward this idea that I not only have the right to, but in fact need to pursue the summer dreams, and not get bogged down and bound up in doubtful snow. This may seem elementary and obvious to you, but, for a person as repressed as I’ve always been, this idea is revolutionary.
The County Fair is also sponsored by Sixpoint Craft Ales, which means locally made beer - plus food from Jake's Bar-B-Que, raffles, giveaways, face painting, balloons and more - not to mention an all day extravaganza of bluegrass, folk, and country blues from bands including Dirt Floor Revue, Kamara Thomas, Big Slyde, The Newton Gang, the Whiskey Boys, I'll Be John Brown, Maynard and The Musties, Jack Grace Band, Ramblin' Andy and the See Ya Laters, Trailer Radio, The Dustbusters and Hans Chew.
I put this to the officials working on the project. And I found the answer instructive.

“You talk to most kids who go to college who are conservatives, and you are singled out, you are ridiculed, you are — I can tell you personally.?.?.

The particular book that Sam suggests (Robin Williams, The Non-Designer’s Design Book) is not bad.

I would like to introduce the company ‘PR Couture’, which operates the business related to fashion PR, Marketing and Social Media. I found this company by chance, while looking for someone or some organization to follow on Twitter. As a PR graduate student, who likes clothes, shoes, bags, etc. –let’s say fashion-, ‘PR Couture’ was MUST FOLLOWING subject for me. It was an interesting experience that finding some topic or information effortlessly in such a short time. A couple of weeks later, when I logged in Twitter, and @PR_Couture tweeted about job, and that was a huge appeal. Since, I had to flight back to my country within a month, which is why I felt sorry for myself and I decided to ask whether she knew about similar companies in Korea or Hong Kong. And a few minutes later, @PR_Couture replied me. Really? Such a big company answered my question within 10 minutes? It’s cliché to say, but I indeed realized the power of Twitter through this experience.

I like to say I am blessed. I had time to consider my options. Many don’t understand some of the decisions I have made and how could they when they are not the ones that have had to make them. My doctors gave me all my options and I explored them all. I looked at what I could and could not live with. The one thing I knew was that I could not let fear be a priority in my life. I had a breast MRI that showed another tumor in the same breast. So my options were limited to a mastectomy of that breast or a bilateral. I chose the bilateral. Two months after I was diagnosed I went in for surgery. The pathology report and lymph node biopsy showed that I did not have lymph node involvement or vascular involvement. I chose to have reconstruction. Only instead of being a double D I chose to go with a size C. I always wanted a reduction. My brother joked that I always had to do things to the extreme.

Here is a little video which gives you the atmosphere and the excellent flow on the floor, better I think than I have experienced anywhere. I focused on a couple of friends, who live thousands of miles apart but have great chemistry when they dance together, and both of them told me (before agreeing that I could upload it) that this dance felt even better than it looked. She has the kind of tango face you want to bottle and take home for when you're feeling depressed, so I'm doing a public service here.

Page 3 of The Sun is one thing, but the fact that our newspapers continue to demean their female readership through the construction of specially designated trivial content is another. Unfortunately the public are used to tabloid sexism and blatant objectification, but the problem is more severe when, in my view, entire supplements completely numb the minds of women.

Life really is all about choice. You choose to be happy or sad. You choose to laugh or cry. You choose to grasp opportunities or ignore them. You choose to be the person you want to be, or not. You choose to step out of your comfort zone and be the person you really can be. Sometimes all it takes is a little nudge!
When we were thinking about co-sleeping, it wasn't really with an eye on the benefits of sharing a family bed---it was more because we just could not wrap our heads or hearts around the idea of leaving a baby in a crib. To us, something that small, that helpless, that perfect, that sweet, and that dependent simply required us to be as close as possible for as much time as possible. I mean, all other rationales aside, how to you spend your entire day holding a baby close to you, nurturing, cuddling, allowing her to explore your face with her fingers as she learns how to work her eyes, letting him suck on your nose and fall asleep on your chest, and then just put the baby in another room alone when night comes? That dichotomy seemed too much to bear. It just felt wrong, regardless of whatever logic someone tried to douse it with.

When I walk around to the other side of the building, I can see white-out conditions with a snow storm! And through another window it will have cleared up. It's not that we have different types of windows in this building, but that the weather can change from moment to moment. If I am not quick in getting a photo, it will be gone!

Not many thoughts on the book because the novel never offers many. The society in which are characters live is disturbing and the games are a brutal reminder of the darkness that can live in our hearts. The main character asks herself if killing a person is so much different than killing an animal. In our world of rules it is but in a world were rules are for the hopeless, maybe not. The Hunger Games is a great read and I recommend it to those that need a break from books that weigh to heavily on the mind and those that read books that don’t.
Here are some things catching my eye tonight...
The emails show ATF agents were aware they might lose track of Kingery while they allowed him to transport the grenade parts into Mexico. The emails also show ATF agents knew that the grenades could end up exploding and killing innocent people if they proceeded with the plan. That didn’t stop the Obama administration’s ATF from allowing the grenades to walk.

I left Austin right after the certification, thinking it was all over. The lease was up on our little limestone cottage and it seemed silly to move into a hotel. The truth was, I had come to hate the recount period, hated the way it made me feel like some kind of hanger-on. Karl was starting to focus on the first hundred days of the new administration, but that wasn’t what I did. I was a campaign guy and no matter what Bill Daley said, the campaign had ended on November 7, 2000.
Excuse me, but where is the threat? It seems to me that Nugent is implying that he would be threatened under an Obama second term simply for speaking out in opposition to Obama, and especially the liberal assault on the Second Amendment. I certainly don't see Eric Holder and his InJustice Department going after the black KKK (aka the New Black Panthers) making bounties and threats.

In issuing Proclamation No. 1064, the government has taken the step necessary to open up the island to private ownership. This gesture may not be sufficient to appease some sectors which view the classification of the island partially into a forest reserve as absurd. That the island is no longer overrun by trees, however, does not becloud the vision to protect its remaining forest cover and to strike a healthy balance between progress and ecology. Ecological conservation is as important as economic progress.

You know how much damage the making of new paper costs our environment. However, there is hardly any substance that can replace the function of paper. Even high-tech computers are not able to eliminate the need for paper. But there is one thing we can do to lessen our use of paper in our own way. You can segregate white office paper from other office trash for recycling. But with a bit creativity and effort, you can turn recycled paper supplies to a profitable business.
The idea to create twenty-four began selfishly: I wanted to make a magazine. For me, print magazines are a fascinating medium, combining content, design, a crafted physical object and the opportunity to curate an ongoing conversation around a single idea. Twenty-four is simultaneously a print magazine, an online experience and a creative challenge. The goal is simple: a small team of creative professionals conceptualise, design, write and photograph a print magazine in 24 hours and document everything via Flickr, Tumblr, YouTube, Storify and Kickstarter, making the process part of the product. Time-restricted projects have been done for comics, art shows, albums and other magazines before; it seems we increasingly invest in experiences over products and we want more transparency from the artists we love.

Warming Plant was initially created on the night before Christmas Eve in December of 2004. the name Ourson was originally conceived as an exclusive moniker for this project to reflect how the album was intended for my parents. four ambient tracks were recorded in one sitting in my studio apartment in New York City using a synthesizer and a tape deck. afterward, the album was lost and forgotten for two years until moving back to West Virginia in 2006. when rediscovered, it was remastered and then shelved for five more years.

Strictly speaking, Herge is not an author per se but rather a comic writer and illustrator. Yet his absolute brilliance and creativity still warrants his inclusion in my top childhood authors list. I remembered adoring the entire Tintin series for the kick ass adventures where the journalist cum detective would embark on his journey to exotic new places such as Congo, Egypt and even to the moon.

Nor is it likely to be pleasant for the rest of America. The poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere-a perfect little chunk of Africa-lurks just 600 miles off the coast of Florida. A U.S. Embassy survey in November 1999 found that 70 percent of Haitians have given “serious thought” to leaving. As things get worse they won’t just think about it. Former U.S. ambassador to Haiti Ernest Preeg says bluntly: “If we didn’t have a credible Coast Guard interdiction policy-which presently sends these people back-you would be talking about hundreds of thousands landing on our beaches.”

What I didn’t like at times was that Vandenburg used specific examples throughout his book while still remaining somewhat vague. He talked about his fifth grade teacher early in the book who was the first to turn his fifth grade belief that “I had no choice” on its ear. At the same time, he doesn’t mention exactly what he was trying to assert having no choice on. The reader has to assume that it has to do with homework, but it would have been nice for the author to be more specific. Still, the point comes across that he learned a valuable lesson about his thought process from interactions with that teacher. With that, he does go into incredible detail on are the actual discussions of that particular thought process.
GIRLS NIGHT tonight! - this time at my girl Krit's pad - it's gonna be GREEN GALORE! - she's the Irish girl in the pack, so she's throwing the Irish theme party - which btw did you know TODAY is INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY?! -- CELEBRATE LADIES!!!! - time for the bubbly!
Nevertheless, I was nicely greeted by girls of such types that day. Yes, I was. And as you would have thought, I was taken aback to see them smile at me and show me a peace sign. Nah, I never doubt their sincerity. After I came back to my senses at that moment, I thought that they had smiled at me because they were the crew in charge and they would have seemed impolite as though they did not welcome us had not they smiled at me. And my mates.
Initially, maybe it seems like a silly question. Maybe you are sitting there saying "Hey Pat, all they ever drink in the Bible is wine, Jesus wouldn't want a beer!" Well, friend, I beg to differ. Michael M. Homan, associate professor of Hebrew Bible at Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans, believes that ancient Israelites proudly drank beer, especially on the Sabbath. He even notes Bible passages that suggest people drink beer to ease their troubles. It makes sense; beer is said to be the oldest brewed beverage in human history, and the first brewing activity has been traced back as far as the sixth millennium BC in ancient Iran and Egypt. Pre-dating the use of hops in beer, these brews were typically made using herbs, fruit and honey.

Sunday is normally a quieter day but this then allows for more chatting between the guests and exhibitors as the number of attendees in the dealers room is more affected by the panels which included workshops by Chi-Tan and Inko on Manga and Dave Shelton on children's drawing. Indeed considering how busy the two mangaka girls were doing portraits over the weekend, the workshop may have come as something of a break for them. As can be seen above, one of Inko's portraits was of artist Cam Kennedy - more a case of Kenny Yu than Kenny Who. From the old guard of Star Wars artists to the new and Clone Wars artist Tanya Roberts was showing off her new work while artist Colin MacNeil seemed to have managed to do more than his fair share of covers of many of the books and comics that were being sold in the room.

How does the government and an economy deal with inflation? Inflation is dealt with via higher interest rates. Mark my words: The artificially low interest rate policies of the past few years will come to hurt us in the form of hyper-inflation and sharply higher interest rates.
Home theater installers prefer to use systems like Control4 or Savant that cost a fortune and are proprietary — you have to use their poorly-designed remotes — and the companies are so young, it’s unlikely they’ll be in business in 10 years. They tell you that these systems are great because you can route a different video source to every room of the house. What’s so hard about that? Years ago that was difficult. But today with HDMI that carries both audio and video, it’s easy. We’re going to have 2 DirecTV boxes and, through inexpensive HDMI splitters, they’ll both be connected to all the A/V receivers so any room can watch either DirecTV. This limits us to 2 different channels on TV throughout the house, but if that’s a problem, we can add a 3rd DirecTV. But I doubt that will be a problem because we already watch less and less from DirecTV.
As I pulled and tugged and gently worked around the flowers last evening, I was reminded of how Mom used to come out and help me weed the beds. She loved it. I hated it. She would spend hours doing it. I would work as fast as I could to try to get done as quickly as I could. I just didn't find the joy she found in pulling weeds. But you know, now I would give anything to spend hours with her out there. And last evening was the first time I actually didn't mind being on my hands and knees working through the beds. (I hesitate to say I almost enjoyed it!)
Writing is a peculiar balancing act between freedom and discipline. Writers are free to spend their days doing whatever they like; but if they don't write, then they are not writers. They are on their own and so vulnerable to every distraction, whether that's drink or the Antiques Roadshow. Jonathan Franzen has said that "it is doubtful that anyone with an internet connection in his workplace is writing good fiction". Family is, of course, the most potent distraction, and probably the only distraction that makes you feel virtuous when you surrender to it.

Players never try to imprint themselves onto their characters, but rather focus on what that character’s story is and act it out. The dungeon master creates a world in which those characters act.

So the next morning (Tuesday) I called Dr. Tulipan's office to talk with Melissa. She said she already had an email in her inbox about this situation, and she was furious. At that point, I just wanted to move on, but I wanted to explain what happened and why we didn't see Dr. T. She said she had an email from him saying, "I don't know why this mom didn't let anyone know she was there to see me..." @#$%^&!!!!! Melissa said she set him straight about it. In the meantime I was getting all of Nate's records sent to Cincinnati for a 3rd opinion.
Here's something to peek at while I am running nuts....
I believe there are bad apples in all spheres of society and like any rotten produce, they make the most stink. Let's face it, the ANC has been a disaster for South Africa. Everything bad you see around you is the causal effect of bad Marxist and racist policies by the ANC. That leaves us with one conclusion: the ANC must go. The irony and sad part is that despite their woeful record as a 'government', the ANC will win next year's election and probably with an even larger majority. Why? Because people refuse to participate in the political process, leaving their fate in the hands of politicians who "know better". That is such a naif mentality. Politicians act for themselves. Our many postings about gravy junkets for example, proves that.

So, last week we went for our check up to see that I was suppressed and that would mean we would then be able to start growing the eggs and get the dates for our retrieval and transfer…you know, the fun parts!! We were so upbeat at the clinic and really had no idea that something could be wrong. When I got the phone call in the afternoon, I was stunned. My body isn’t responding to being suppressed so we have to double our medicine dose and come back in a week to test again. Tomorrow we find out if the increased medicine has done the trick.

Any other spinning books are simply icing on the cake.

Don’t: Correct every theologically incorrect statement. If something a family member says bugs you because it isn’t right – get over it. You can deal with stuff like this later privately in the grieving process if it is appropriate. This goes for the funeral service as well. It is not our duty to correct every false statement made during the time when family and friends speak.

You wouldn't have met a person lazier about diet and exercise than me 2 years ago. When I moved from Miami in 2005, I was the heaviest I've ever been. I hate to even reveal the number because it was just not healthy at all. I was in a size 16 (from a size 5 just 4 yrs prior)!!! For a 20-yr-old who is only 5'1", it not only affected the way I felt on the outside, but inside, I was not well. I couldn't make it up a flight of stairs, living in hot & humid Miami was a nightmare. I felt gross because I perspired so much just from the energy it took for me to get around. It sucked, for lack of a better word. I was always naturally petite and sometime in high school, things just got out of control.

I was lucky enough to score one of the last bottles of this gem at a clearance price when they discontinued it in Ontario. In the case of the Auchentoshan 18, the drop in price was both a blessing and a curse. A blessing in that I would probably have never forked over the extra $20 they originally wanted for it, and it was so very worth what I did pay. However, it was a curse in the sense that this bottle must last me until I can find another affordable source for this precious whisky.
Back at the hotel, we dropped off our shopping goodies and headed out to the north shore. A friend we met at the Barefoot bar the other night said the waves were pretty high. Not for us!

So, I was back to Rapid City in mid-march and I enjoyed watching the rest of the world cup matches and was thrilled to watch team India lift the world cup. Soon to follow was the NFL season. In September, the New Orleans Saints opened the NFL regular season with a game against the defending champions from the 2010 season, the Packers. I bought an iPhone 4 for myself and was enjoying the hype surrounding the iPhone 4S/5. But, after Apple released the iPhone 4S and its iCloud services, I was not very impressed by the iPhone anymore. I wanted change, for the better. And the change came in the form of Windows Phone. I was sick of trying to jailbreak, and install custom themes, and all other s**t you need to do to make the iPhone work for you the way you want it to.On September 14, my father received the Presidential Award from the president of India Smt.

Gossip Girl is an offender on this point as well. Following Blair’s rejection from Yale, Chuck surprised her by letting her know he’d slipped an application for her off to NYU. This one I’m willing to give a pass to, however. A big theme of that show is how these kids are the rich elite and they routinely get away with crap because of that. Chuck is at least shown talking to someone from NYU at one point, and I don’t doubt his ability to print off Blair’s college applications and essays, get a forged signature, and submit it. Also as previously noted, Blair legitimately has the grades and resume to get into NYU all on her own, and the college application process was a theme of hers throughout the season when this happened.

Voters have been rejecting red light cameras in a nationwide backlash and contract disputes with private camera companies have led to expensive lawsuits.

Organic forms and landscapes are a dominant, yet not entirely encompassing motif in the work. As Michael Knight recently observed, there are minimalist undercurrents, the desire to “eliminate composition and focus on the singular object.” However, if Donovan is a minimalist, it is of a sort that does not mind illusion and poetics. Even Donovan’s large cubes, toothpicks, pins, and glass held together by gravity and friction, are strange surfaces, masses that romantically linger rather than assert themselves in Ace’s large corridors. Donovan seems to be imaginative through and through.

Identities slip and change and merge and never seem to be fully grounded because that's L.A. Specifically, that's the way of people constantly trying on different masks as they strive to be what they believe each person wants them to be; of people who try on identities like shirts in a Macy's fitting room because they aspire to make a living being different people, because they need different things from different people with different temperaments, as they glad-hand and ass-kiss and schmooze and gently pester and fuck their way up the rear fire escape of the Hollywood food chain. It's a town of bottom feeders all convinced they're the next Brando or Meryl Streep or (God help us) the next Orlando Bloom or somebody, and they're fully prepared to kill — be it relationships or friendships or their own dignity — to keep the shards of their increasingly cracked illusions from hitting the floor around them.

Do they serve the people, who love Joel Ann's market that has sold local produce to the community since forever (the land has been in her family since the 20s)... or do they serve the special interests (real estate, banks, lawyers, construction companies, property owners) that expect to make money off the future subdivisions?

One of the best things about living in military housing is they drop a park about every 5 feet. You pretty much can’t go down a street in any neighborhood without hitting one. However, they are grossly underused by my family. Why? One, because I’m the worst about getting wrapped up in my own to do list that I don’t think about taking a break and walking over with the kids instead of herding them to the toy box in the living room. And two, because of my kids nap schedule. It is totally not conducive to outdoor play. Ryan goes down about 10-10:30 and sleeps until 2ish (I know, my kids are AWESOME nappers….3-4 hours is the norm, although Isabel is finally starting to outgrow it….wop wop), and Isabel goes down sometime between 1 & 2 and wakes up between 3 & 5. Then its dinner time. Sigh.

Paul Krugman and Dean Baker both claim that government debt is the safest investment in the world because government never defaults on its debt. They also claim that spending to an essentially unlimited degree is acceptable and that doing so does not burden future generations because government never repays its debt, which strikes me as contradictory.

How did lives of the Thessalonians change when they became Christians? What did they stop doing? What did they start doing?
If reviewers are commissioned by publications, in my view they should be paid for that work. But it is nothing to me if they are not. That is between them and their employers. What happens at paid shows is nothing to me either. But in my view, both (the employers of) reviewers and competition judges should pay for their show tickets. Otherwise, this is money taken from the pockets of performers. When restaurants are reviewed by most reputable publications, the reviewers remain anonymous and pay for their meals.

She thinks that I am her husband at times which either makes my wife laugh or cry depending on her mood.

Would it be safe to describe the ‘survivors’ of the ongoing Holocaust as browbeaten, subjugated, broken, demoralized, exploited or similar adjectives?

December 1983. A Christmas party down in the East Village, at 240 East 13th Street. It was B.Y.O.B., and Genevieve Cook brought a bottle of Baileys Irish Cream. The host was a young man employed as a typist at Chanticleer Press, a small Manhattan publishing company that specialized in coffee-table books. Genevieve had worked there briefly but had left to attend graduate school at Bank Street College, up near Columbia, and was now an assistant teacher for second and third graders at Brooklyn Friends School. She was living temporarily at her mother and stepfather’s place on the Upper East Side.

Grace holds a special place in my heart too, not just because she’s a boxer, but because she is such a love bug! She is also one of Fergus’ best pals.
It seems Brewdog didn't pay the bill upfront as required and wouldn't supply beer in kegs large enough to be practicable at a very busy festival. Brewdog are already putting their own spin on events but I'm tiring of their raucous proclamations and deliberate courting of controversy.
Sparging was, of course, initially a purely Scottish practice. I don't think Barnard has quite understood its purpose, which is really to extract sugars left in the grains after running off the first wort.

Found a sweet deal on a 7" Flip Down Car DVD CD Player GPS HD PIP Ipod Bluetooth Partridge in a Pear Tree Touch Screen for a little over $200 on eBay. After looking at what they wanted for similar radios at CarToys and the like, this was a helluva deal even if it was an off brand. Thought it would be a nice addition to my F350. It's been years since I've installed a new radio in anything but I used to be pretty good at it back in the day.
Spring is a very beautiful time of the year here in the Glade. I especially like it when the bright green new leaves are seen against a beautiful blue sky. The blooming redbud trees in our yard are a nice bonus.
The food here, is like always, is absolutely fabulous! I’ve been turned on to horchata and atole, which are both sugary delicious drinks. The food here is really fresh, and it completely makes the difference from the fruit that we import in the states. Everything here is a little salty, but it is well complimented by the pan and the tortillas that are customary to eat with every meal.
This immediately puts the reader on the defensive: It is not likely we will understand the parables and we need to listen to them anew, listen to them afresh, and work our way through them again and again. After all, these stories were preserved for us, the Church. Yet, they were spoken to people who were not yet the church in any completely modern sense. Only too often do we allow what we ‘already know’ to get in the way of what is really there. We must admit that it is always difficult to avoid the biases that we carry to the text. Capon illustrates his point by directing our attention to the rejection of Jesus by his contemporaries:
The man who holds her captive, and who fathered him, brings them their food and other items they might need. They have a TV where Jack sees things that are “real” and “not real”.
The coffee shop opened bright and early on Saturday the 14th. The floor, spotless, not even really showing where the blood had stained the grout between the tiles.
3:00 p.m.: A friend stops by and mentions that a colleague of his at the Hotel de l’Amitié yesterday reported seeing truckloads of paratroopers in red berets arriving at the ORTM compound, firing in the air. Originally this was thought to be the “counter-coup” but, my friend says, the paratroopers were only arriving to reinforce the troops loyal to the CNRDR. He also tells me that a neighbor of his in the Sabalibougou neighborhood (a couple of miles southeast of me) was killed by a stray bullet outside his home on Thursday.

One who calls himself a Sikh of the Guru, the True Guru, shall rise in the early morning hours and meditate on the Lord’s Name….Then, at the rising of the sun, he is to sing Gurbani; whether sitting down or standing up, he is to meditate on the Lord’s Name. (Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 305)
Ignoring previous instances of injury, let us say for the purposes of this column that it began two weeks ago. We were at our friend’s house and I was pushing our daughter on the swing outside. Mind you, because she is a thrill seeker, she was laying on the swing on her belly, like in a flying motion. I want to specify that my wife bore witness to this and did not pose verbal opposition. Unless she voices her disapproval, I can only assume
"This is my home," she said.
That’s what I said last night before I went to bed. I was scheduled to work from 6:45am to 12pm.

The crazy fuck up is so wild and at the center of attention all the time with so many stories simply because she’s….well…fucked up. This version of THAT friend either has a drug problem or sleeps around a lot or steals or whatever. It’s always something. It’s like they always have to have drama around them or at least be the center of attention.

“Our law affords constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education. Carey v. Population Services International,431 U.S., at 685 . Our cases recognize the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child. Eisenstadt v. Baird, supra, 405 U.S., at 453 (emphasis in original). Our precedents “have respected the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.” Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944). These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State. [505 U.S. 833, 852] “
This next shade of eyeshadow is 29네이비 스파클 (navy sparkle). Similar to the grey brown eyeshadow above, it has some noticeable shimmer in it. However, I find the sparkles a lot more noticeable when you apply it. The shimmer particles are so gorgeous.. I'm not sure why but the silver shimmer with the navy is a lot more alluring to me~
You are beautiful. You are valuable. You are enough.

So being as they were sponsering us this week and the fact that I have some of their goodies unused in my drawer I thought I would dig them out for the challenge.

Dies: Spellbinder; Nestabilities
I have journaled to God in the past. I still have a journal handy in fact, but I haven’t written in it since about January. I think that it’s a very good thing to be able to write feelings down to God even though He already knows how we’re feeling. Journaling is one of my favorite ways to talk to God and while it began awkwardly last year when I first started, I have really grown to love doing it.

Poet and pervert, Humbert Humbert becomes obsessed by twelve-year-old Lolita and seeks to possess her, first carnally and then artistically, out of love, ‘to fix once for all the perilous magic of nymphets’. This seduction is one of many dimensions in Nabokov’s dizzying masterpiece, which is suffused with a savage humour and rich, elaborate verbal textures.

At the recent 12th Annual R-CALF USA Convention in Rapid City, SD, an audience member asked Mike Callicrate, a Kansas cattle feeder, if the EPA had, indeed, declared hay a pollutant. His affirmative answer was startling to many, but not necessarily surprising in light of the US government’s apparent agenda to destroy every single producing sector in the nation and to reduce the country to a poverty-stricken, corporately-dominated wasteland.
My wife says she is unhappy and a mess? I wonder.
As I had mentioned in my 2010 Resolution Post, I will be featuring one homestead room each month, and to begin the year off right, I am starting with the home office! The home office really contains so many items that pertain to living an organized life, and many resolute to get organized with their office spaces and personal budgets for the new year. Which is why I think it's a great space to kick off with!!
Think about trying to find some assistance in a warehouse-type mega store, and then compare that with finding service at your local, small-town farm or hobby store. (BTW, if you’ve never had the privilege of going to such a store, make it a priority. You will discover the definition of GREAT customer service!). What makes them so different? It is the fact that, to those workers, it isn’t necessarily “just a job.” They are knowledgable of the products they are selling, and they enjoy helping customers (or at least they act like it really well). They aren’t focused on just “making the sale,” rather, they generally try to help the customer find the item that will best suit his needs. In turn, they create happy, satisfied customers that become loyal, return customers. Many people are willing to even pay a little more for an item just to receive and support that type of service. Here are a few tips for good customer service…

And just as a side note: Rankin based his book (and according to the Wiki most of his others) in Brentford, UK (and on their very real football team, the Brentford F.C.) Looking over online details make Brentford out as a very interesting place too, though nowhere as intimate as Rankin makes it in his book. I do get the phenomena from my brief time in the UK. There is a very different feel to towns in the UK to town in the US., and I don’t mean this in criticism to either place. But I remember sensing much more intimacy and awareness of community in most places in the UK, even larger “towns” which could be easily compared to small cities in the U.S.. (my closest example would be obviously Solihul since that’s where we stayed during our time in England. Located just south eat of Birmingham, Solihul would easily be comparable to a small city size and population-wise here, but it felt more like a hamlet than anything more.)

Finally, we still need to dissect the discomfiture of the elites with Mayawati’s statues building at a very raw, getting under the skin level. Mayawati with her ilk, who play by different rules may not have imbibed the refined art of covert aggrandizement. It is too much in the open – the big golden ear-rings she wears, the huge birthday cake she cuts with toadies looking on – is too easy to condemn. But at one level, it is understood that this flamboyance does not follow the idioms the mandarins of elite Indian society are used to – she doesnt go playing golf or drinking Johnny Walker Blue Label with public money – she makes her and her mentor’s statues. The acceptable methods and the range of permissible display of helping oneself with public money has been normalized and well worked out for other groups and sectors which have been in power for much longer periods of time – in some cases, centuries. The new interloper either hasnt learnt that yet or has a different game to play- in both cases, she poses a danger to the models of silent theft, and more broadly to the upper caste consensus of how political life is organized.
So how do you get around people’s resistance? According to Peter give them control. Much easier said than done but Peter also gives a bit of guidance in the form of three steps on how to do this along with an analogy that makes perfect sense to me. Basically you need to be more outcome focused and while you can suggest a route to get that outcome, you also need to be open to different routes as long as the outcome is satisfied.

If all goes well and you get the mortgage loan you might have between a fortnight to the 100 a short time to repay the amount of money. The vast majority of loan providers have settlement options. Often you might remove the overall quantity of the money quicker should you favor with no fees.
So then the day came to a close and after a bit of a debrief, we retired quietly to our hotel (alright, there was a bit more steak tasting in the evening) and I do have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed my trip to Donald Russell. It was certainly an eye opener in some respects. Going back to my initial provisos about buying meat online, I would glady order from them in future. There are a couple of buts though. I think firstly, it would be encouraging to see Donald Russell embrace the artisan behind their trade and push it to the forefront because it was certainly evident. One of the many things we talked about on the trip was the fact that butchery is slowly becoming a dying trade in this country and Mark Farquhar, Head Butcher at Donald Russell, spoke of initiatives to support the industry such as apprenticeships, training schemes etc. If I could go to the website and see more of that happening then personally, it would be more of a draw to use them.
....“He was pretty technology-oriented for the time,” Card said. “Between the telephone, the telegraph, the phonograph and photography, I think he was pretty much on the cutting edge.”...President Obama was suggesting that Republicans are anti-technology for opposing windmills and not supporting railroads and and for denying that the globe is rapidly rising in temperature because of actions of mankind, and attempting to make his point by comparing the Republicans of today to past backwardness. But as usual, the reality is the exact opposite of everything that he said.

The Vindicarn War is a distant memory and Byron’s days of piloting Cosbolt fighters are over.

I know it's been like a year since we posted last. I'm also about 7 months behind in just going through pictures if that clues you in. While I was doing said action, I found this picture and couldn't resist. It's too good not to share. This was back in December, but too cute! Haven loves dress-up, but this day she combined many elements of many costumes. She thought she was bootiful...which she is.
However, amidst all this inanity, it is to be noted that the necessity of stronger laws and modified institutions is a top priority. Stringent action towards the process of administrative bridling is an urgent concern. Corruption and lack of appropriate preventive measures are eating into a system which should have enough credibility to shoulder a nation of 1.2 billion. Albeit, baiting the proposition of self-governance and direct democracy is not going to solve the issue of corruption. It will, moreover, create unwanted lawlessness and land in the stagnancy of subordination. As is already observed – the civil society wanting Anna Hazare to be granted undeviated access and power in the Lokpal panel confirms the naïveté with which the ‘people power’ justifies the remedy of a crisis already causing much struggle in the bureaucratic chain.
When it comes to solutions to the current debate, if some form of State generated ID is (still) required, you would think that an international passport would be as good as an internal passport (or ID card) for the purposes of identification within Ukraine and that in fact, an either/or situation would be good enough.

So…I’d like to transition this idea of allowing vision to change our lives to us here, at Beth Yeshua. The fact is, God has spoken to the Eldership of this congregation and our Eldership over time to move their hearts toward a very concrete vision for Beth Yeshua. We even have a fancy “corporate” expression of our vision statement that has been around for quite some time. Over the next two or three weeks I’d like to share that vision with you and I’d like for us to invite the Ruach HaKodesh to counsel us in our deepest parts – so that this would be much more than just … “Oh. Josh is trying to ‘norm’ us to what Beth Yeshuites should be.”

There are some teams included here that have major questions surrounding them (Wisconsin's B1G struggles, Florida's lack of beefy wins, etc), but in those two cases, the efficiency numbers point to ultimate success. Wisconsin is #3 overall in the Pomeroy ratings, sport the nations lowest Turnover%, the nation's best EffectiveFG% defense, and #2 overall Adjusted Defensive Efficiency. The Gators are rated #13 overall with the #1 offense. For now, those two get the benefit of the doubt...for now. Wiscy will have to turn around that conference record and Florida will have to win a lot of SEC games. And, I expect both will do that...for now.
When Gina can't get past the heartbreak of her life, she throws herself into her work. She becomes very successful at doing things on her terms in her own way; and prefers to work alone. Then a man with a deep muffled voice contacts her and makes it clear he's that he's been watching her and challenges her to solve rhyming clues for a shot at revealing his identity. A Federal agent, the handsome Joey Zicara, is assigned to assist and protect her. That changes everything.
This project was inspired by this pin from the sweet Ruffled blog. They used strips of cotton muslin to create beautiful dip-dyed ribbon for packages, but I thought it'd be fun to to try with paper. The supplies couldn't be any easier or cheaper...large roll of white streamers and food coloring...both from the Dollar Store.
We respect each other and each other’s interests. We also give each other the freedom and space to exercise those interests. The fact that those activities often coincide with a community event is possibly the glue that has helped hold our loving relationship together.

One of the most important lessons we all learnt was trust the divine. Of course, for each of us the divine took a distinct, and a more personal, form. Some of us called it the universe, some have called it the white light, others said it was God, and more have called it the Higher Self or Higher Consciousness. Though the perceptive form was different the source was the same. We all learnt to trust in something beyond us. We learnt to stop controlling too much and to trust and to flow with the course of events.
