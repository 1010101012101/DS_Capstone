ScienceIndex.com's Neurology category covers the nervous system and its disorders. It currently contains 40,521 articles partly derived from 147 scientific journals. The latest articles in this category are also available through a Neurology Sciences RSS feed. One of the latest additions covers depression and quality of life in monogenic compared to idiopathic, early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Depression affected 31% of early-onset PD cases, 21% of late-onset cases, and 44% of manifesting carriers of mutations in PD genes, but was rare in the nonmanifesting carriers (7%) and healthy controls (5%). The authors suggest that the Quality of Life (QoL) and, possibly, overall prognosis of all PD patients can be improved by appropriate attention and treatment for depression, sleep impairments, and anxiety, even if the treatment of the motor problems cannot be further optimized. Another recently published article in this category reviews treatments for diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSP) is the most frequent form of diabetic neuropathy and effective disease-modifying treatment is not available beyond the interventions of optimal glycemic control, and possibly lifestyle and risk factor modification. The authors summarize that effective treatments for painful DSP include pregabalin, amitriptyline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, gabapentin, opioids, nitrate sprays, capsaicin, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.

As Martin Indyk, Ken Lieberthal and I explain in our new book, "Bending History: Barack Obama's Foreign Policy," that approach should come as no surprise for this president. In office, Mr. Obama has become a reluctant realist — less focused on the grand visions and hopes of his campaign, more on the immediate foreign policy chores of keeping America safe. And on Afghanistan specifically, no metamorphosis was needed. From the beginning of his presidential campaign, Barack Obama had made it clear that he viewed the Afghanistan conflict as the correct war to pursue in the aftermath of Sept. 11. He pledged to swing focus from Iraq to Afghanistan and often spoke of adding at least two brigades of U.S. combat forces to the latter mission, as the Taliban regained strength during the second term of the Bush presidency.

But riches of character are revealed, with copious visual invention. (The cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, who shot last week's thriller "Contraband," fills "Coriolanus" with startling images.) Mr. Fiennes's Martius, head shaven and covered with blood, becomes a cautionary character, a rigid soldier ill-suited to civic affairs.

A: This is a topic that I feel strongly about. I think removing the "dead" leaves is fine in a home-landscape situation. I do, however, think you have removed way too much. The agave needs its leaves to protect its core from the sun. By removing too many leaves, you have exposed the core and it has responded by collapsing. Many "gardeners" or maintenance people really don't know the plants they are trimming and the culture of the plant. That's a future topic I can't wait to discuss further.

Los Angeles is so movie-saturated that you forget the crimes were real. A trip northeast of town to the Los Angeles Police Historical Society Museum - housed in a decommissioned police precinct headquarters - slaps some sense into you. It also makes you realize that the city's noirishness both predates the film genre and mutated into a surrealist noir in the '60s and beyond.
Bebame: Portland wine wholesaler Don Heistuman sells high-end wines for a living, "beautiful wines, Barbaresco and Burgundy, but not things you drink every day," he says. Most evenings he found himself wanting something fresh and bright to have with his dinner. He usually went with wines from France or Italy — Vermentino, Barbera, Beaujolais and especially the reds from the Loire, such as Chinon and Bourgueil. "I kept thinking, Why can't these things be made here?" Heistuman says.
If such an arrangement is approved, the mayor would be targeted immediately by every pressure group whose existence depends on grabbing a portion of the district's tax revenue. The mayor would be pressured by behind-the-scenes players and campaign contributors, intent on retaining their vending contracts or maintaining their relatives' employment at this or that school.
Saute is French for "jump." Not the chef, but the food. When done right, sauteing is a basic technique that helps food retain flavor and texture. Here's are step-by-step instructions on how to saute a mirepoix, a trilogy of carrots, celery and onions used in classic French stews and soups. The technique, however, can be utilized for any recipe that calls for sautéing:

Position players are supposed to report today, and many made their first appearances of camp: Troy Glaus slugged a few home runs and caught up with pal, Adam Kennedy, during a backlot batting practice. ... Brian Barton, the Ruel 5 outfielder, took cuts off a tee, arriving shortly after the team took to the field for workouts. ... Scott Spiezio clocked in early Monday morning. ... Shortstop Cesar Izturis unpacked a Pittsburgh Pirates bag this afternoon, and non-roster outfielder Nick Stavinoha set up his locker a few minutes later.
Kaprielian is undoubtedly the talk of the town, at least among baseball followers. Even in our newsroom, people are asking me if there has ever been a better pitcher in this city.
Leaders in the city have chosen to sidestep this reality for years because of the perilous nature of dealing with tax policy. However, we asked to do this job in good times and bad. When times are good, tough realities are easy to keep on the back burner, but economic downturns always force us to “look under the hood.”

Every government agency in California is required to post their agenda – the list of action items they will consider at their upcoming meeting. Most cities post their agendas online, although it isn't required. Some very small agencies simply post their agenda in a public place (as provincial as it may sound, some still print their agendas and tack them onto a bulletin board somewhere within their jurisdiction).
One of the reasons Brady did not deliver was that one of his young tight ends struggled. Gronkowski's biggest mistake came late in the first half, when he fumbled inside the Cleveland 5. If the Patriots had scored a touchdown, they would have made it 17-14. (Browns safety Abe Elam deserves a ton of credit for the huge momentum shift, given that he held up a larger man, grabbed the ball, ripped it out and recovered at the 2.) Gronkowksi also called for a fair catch on the Browns' first kickoff, only to bail and have Sammy Morris try to corral it. The Browns recovered at the New England 19 and punched it in two plays later.
That, I guess, is what made me think of Gray. He didn't plea bargain. He did not implicate others. He did not angle for the leniency that could have easily brought him back home a whole lot sooner.
“I didn’t think there would be another candidate out there that would care as much about that football program as I do,’’ Flood said. “And it would have killed me on the inside to watch that team coached by someone else.’’
Yet there was more to the calls than that. They turned into marathon, 90-minute, wide-ranging, off-the-record discussions that revealed to me the stunning breadth of the man. One minute he'd be talking about sweeping ideas for the digital revolution. The next about why Apple's current products were awful, and how a color, or angle, or curve, or icon was embarrassing.
For anyone for whom that day was a little more real and painful, I completely understand how this movie could make them uncomfortable. That's only fair.

"Keep in mind: Everyone has a right to have their complaints investigated," the mayor said, noting that Greg Kelly hasn’t been charged with any crime.
House Republican leaders decided on the strategy after repeatedly trying and failing to garner enough votes to pass their own, long-term transportation plan. That effort ran into opposition from tea-party conservatives, who say transportation programs should be paid for entirely by user fees such as federal gas and diesel taxes, even though revenue from those taxes isn't enough to cover current transportation spending. Conservatives also would like to see the federal role in transportation dramatically reduced, with states picking up those responsibilities. However, moderate Republicans from suburban districts don't want transportation spending cut and complained about the bill's treatment of transit programs.

Of course, there will be controversy, but Tebowmania will be transformed into Manningmania.
Unfortunately, the national campaigns have veered toward the nasty and the silly this year. Romney survived the primary season thanks in part to super PACs and campaign spending that crushed his long line of rivals with negative commercials. Both parties seem to believe this election will be won by the one who does the best job of destroying the other. With that in mind, it's worth remembering that whether you like him or not, Daniels ran two successful campaigns for governor that were heavy on positive messages and policy ideas. He said political victories that follow "slash-and-burn" campaigns seldom lead to great accomplishments.

Removing employers from the equation would be a partial answer to that problem. Granted, most workers with health benefits are painfully aware that costs are going up because their premiums and copays have been increasing.

Thorough prenatal care is also important for all pregnant women. "Some birth defects can be detected before birth through prenatal tests," Dr. Alvarez says.

The slalom Sunday was my third consecutive top-10 in slalom. That's definitely a move in the right direction, a big step forward in that discipline. My goal at the beginning of the season was to finish in the top 15 in slalom, and I'm in 16th place now, so I'm pretty happy with that. It's good to be in a place where I feel like I can look for speed in slalom instead of just trying to find the finish line, which is what I was doing the past couple of years.
A number of conditions cause shin pain. The shin, by the way, is the tibia, the larger of the two leg bones. You can feel it on the medial side of your lower leg. Medial is the side next to the opposite leg. One of the most frequent causes of shin pain, and the one that I believe pertains to you, is medial tibial stress syndrome. It's an inflammation of the covering of the tibia, the periosteum.

"Conservative" is a funny word. It can mean lots of different things. It reminds me of that line from G.K. Chesterton about the word "good." "The word 'good' has many meanings," he observed.

The theme of the evening was "Dawn of the Dan": songs pulled from the act’s first three albums. This was the era when Steely Dan was the closest they’d ever be to a full-time, traditional working rock band; after "Pretzel Logic," the third set, the group stopped touring, and Fagen and Becker increasingly relied on studio musicians to realize their compositions. An attendee at "Dawn of the Dan" might have reasonably expected to see a relatively stripped-down, rock-oriented version of the band with Becker on bass guitar (the founding member didn’t play much six-string on early Steely Dan albums.)

Tepper's letter came on the heels of two other extraordinary e-mails sent to Reed students last Friday from District Attorney Michael Schrunk and U.S. Attorney Dwight Holton, and from Reed College President Colin Diver. The prosecutors wrote of the increased potency of today's narcotics, and warned that drug dealers are increasingly targeting "middle class and wealthier kids."

Road wins are always tough, but two of the toughest games on SLU's schedule are behind it. Other than a game at Xavier, the Billikens should be the favorite in every game the next three weeks, and the time is now to roll up some wins if they're going to get that arrogance.

"The biggest disappointment is that we didn't get any education reform this year, and we really need to. Now, members of the Legislature are telling me that we're going to get to it in the first quarter of 2012. So I live in hope, John," Christie said.

"It is an obscenity that in the largest city in our state — where we spend $24,000 per pupil per year — that we have a dropout rate that approaches 50 percent," Christie said. "I talked during my campaign about changing the education system in Newark and that’s something I’m still committed to."

The reason is simple. When you accept cash from a venture fund, you may also get hands-on supervision from its staff. Not just board representation. Venture partners camp on you daily until they are comfortable. So, if you are a venture partner responsible for five or 10 companies, flying three or four hours to St. Louis (especially given the dearth of direct flights) versus driving an hour and being home for dinner is a big disadvantage. All things being equal, the tie goes to the start-up closer to the venture firm.

Mr. Sonnenfeld emphasized the matter of choice during a lunchtime show-and-tell that included photographs of a modern 3-D camera—modern in the sense of all the things it can do, but Rube Goldberg-retro in the sense of an enormous, and enormously cumbersome, rig with ancillary gizmos piled atop gizmos like some Watts Tower of digital power. "Before we started 'Men in Black III,'" he said, "we did tests with native 3-D that were painfully slow. I like to work quickly. Comedy needs momentum, and native 3-D shooting is a momentum killer. It didn't make sense to choose a system that worked against the tone of the film."

The original Plumed Horse in Saratoga opened in 1952, but new owners, a new chef and a multimillion-dollar redo have made this into an entirely new restaurant. Its cutting-edge design, with a barrel ceiling, blown-glass chandeliers that change colors, and a three-story glass wine cellar, creates a modern stage for Peter Armellino's contemporary California-inspired menu. Look for some interesting "surf and turf" variations such as Monterey red abalone with pork belly, artichokes and a meaty glaze; and sea scallops paired with smoked duck. Some main courses have subtle Asian influences, such as Beijing-style squab with a dried plum sauce and ginger cabbage.

Is our chocolate chunk and vanilla ice cream sammich the best in the world? Well, we have no idea. But now that we've alluded to it, you probably can't stop thinking about the possibility. Now you're thinking this ice cream sammich is the kind of treat you find at the end of 17-mile-wide rainbows complete with a pot of gold, a leprechaun and one of those weird half-man, half-horse things. See how that works? It's called suggestive mind science. Look it up.

Spellman’s Rondon rolling in increased roll at the plate: Former Spellman coach Dan Crane gave new head man Brendan McCarrick a little nugget of advice before the season started.

Yes. Take pictures of your car before and after your rental and keep them at least six months. The systems used to determine who damaged a rental are far from perfect. At least one company, Hertz, has pledged to begin photographing all of its cars before they leave the lot. The rest have less scientific ways of determining who is responsible for the dings, dents and scratches. If I didn't know any better, I'd say they try to guess who might have done it.

McKinley does find her ghostly indigo — in the studios of contemporary artists whose works sell at auction, in the work of one of the few remaining dyers, at a place McKinley describes as an overly self-aware "Disneyland for the Yoruba arts," where she makes no purchase. But indigo, like so many obscure, searched-for objects, remains elusive, and is not quite the thing McKinley hoped to find. As for meaning, it arrives hastily, with too comfortable a clarity after a story most compelling in the murk.

New York's depth. D.C.'s Olsen acknowledged that excitement over United's 4-1 win should be tempered by the fact that New York "came here with a little bit of a watered-down team." But from a Red Bulls perspective, the stunning capitulation at RFK should be cause for concern. Without the suspended Rafa Márquez or the injured Wilman Conde, Roy Miller and Teemu Tainio, New York defended like minor leaguers. The MLS season is long and injuries, national team call-ups and other distractions take their toll. Right now, the Red Bulls won't contend without a more effective bench.

The recent success in increasing the number of people who live downtown has been a step in the right direction. The construction of the Red Line light rail through downtown would help, too.

The Maryland Stadium Authority's study on the issue should be completed this month, and Gov.Martin O'Malley has included some planning money for the effort in his capital budget proposal. Downtown property owners need to do whatever they can to make this project more feasible because it has the potential to inject much more life into the area than a new Exelon building ever would.

"Of course, of course. The thing is: it's good to be wanted. You can look at it two ways ... if your name is not mentioned, nobody wants you. But it's part of the business. It's nothing anybody can control. You can't control it (and) a lot of times your team can't control it because a lot of times teams just put out information. All you can control is what you do and how you play. So don't worry about it and focus on the game, which I think these guys will do."

In the long run, hydroelectric, wind and solar power probably will play a much larger role in the renewable energy mix than trash-to-methane, in part because burning landfill gas still releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

øA: I don't think surgeons are going to be replaced with robots, but as you know, there's now a robotic approach to doing some kinds of heart surgery. And the robot is the hands of the surgeon, and the surgeon can manipulate those hands and can do a very, very good job of doing an operation through a very small, tiny little incision, not with a larger procedure that's been so historically done. The robot that's currently available and widely used is primarily to repair mitral valves. That same robot is being used for prostate operations and is much less traumatic, and prostate cancer is a very important and growing diagnosis. We will see more of those.
