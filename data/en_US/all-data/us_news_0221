øDespite his courageous display of toughness, Brisiel says it was he who was grateful to the Texans.
Dave Mustaine and metal legends Megadeth hit the stage and opened their impressive nine-song set with "Trust." Bassist Dave Ellefson brought great energy to the stage and is a very instrumental piece of the live show, even if he does seem like he could be your older, cooler uncle. They quickly kicked it into high gear with the classic "Hangar 18" from "Rust in Peace," which really showcased Mustaine's chops. Megadeth staples "Wake Up Dead" and "A Tout Le Monde" followed before they played the new track "Public Enemy No. 1." The crowd went into a frenzy when they played their biggest hit "Symphony of Destruction." They finished strong with "Peace Sells" and "Holy Wars... The Punishment Due," which have both aged gracefully.

That will help, but there are still thousands throughout the state who could benefit from a transitional home. And the need is growing as a new generation of soldiers returns home. But the problem is twofold: In addition to the lack of beds, the sour economy makes it harder for veterans to find jobs that allow them to leave a transitional home, creating a bottleneck. "The entry level jobs that we used to rely on are no longer there," said Victor Carlson, a psychologist and chief of homeless services for the Department of Veterans Affairs New Jersey Health Care System. "There is no upward mobility. If a job becomes vacant, somebody else with a much longer job history is going to take that job. Our veterans have a much harder time competing."

Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler said the department is reviewing the ruling.
The Fed also could cut the interest rate it pays on banks' reserves. That would give banks an incentive to make more loans rather than holding excess reserves, but it won't work if they're too nervous to lend or customers are too nervous to borrow.

The New York Public Library: The Architecture and Decoration of the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, by Henry Hope Reed and Francis Morrone (W.W. Norton; 320 pages; $75). Outside of Washington, D.C., the most voluptuous work of classical architecture in the United States might be the New York Public Library. Appropriate, then, that it's the subject of this lovingly sumptuous study, complete with 250 full-color photographs by Anne Day that make the hefty price (almost) a bargain.
IPhone sales accounted for 58 percent of Apple's revenue, more than ever. Three years ago, the figure was 27 percent.
"I've never been a big fan of the public safety director model. I believe it unnecessarily complicates the process," Scott said. "It builds into the system a great deal of uncertainty over who is running the organization. . . . At the same time, you can end up with a chief perceived (by rank and file) as weak. It creates a lot of uncertainty about accountability."
And then there are my favorite megaliths, hardly prehistoric. They appear in two panels on the western portal of the Carnac church, flanking Cornelius. He was the patron saint of cattle, which is why the paintings feature cows, placidly waiting for milking time among fields of prehistoric stone.
They weren't my mom's biscuits, though, and for Mother's Day, I want my mom's biscuits -- split and toasted and buttered, with honey dripping down my hands, and then later on with strawberries and whipped cream for dessert. So I will keep trying. Because while my mom's biscuits are without a doubt really bad for your arteries, believe me when I say that they are very, very good for your heart.
The Cellers Can Blau, made up of 40 percent each syrah and mazuelo (cariñena) and 20 percent garnacha, has been well received in the wine press for its elegance and flavor. I agree. Take one whiff of this deeply fragrant wine and you won't be able to resist. This is a luscious, full-bodied, complex red that has layers of dark cherry, plum, cedar and black pepper spice. It's big but well-balanced, with 14 percent alcohol. But it's also a wine that needs food and would be a good match with beef as well as with lamb.
Like any other employment sector, the government sector should expand or contract as needs and willingness to pay change among consumers (in this case, taxpayers). Our federal government, especially, has not been willing to contract. Instead, it has borrowed in order to keep expanding. The consequences of that have been delayed repeatedly, in hopes that the economy would recover sufficiently to let a government in hock up to its eyeballs keep living the lie that all is well.

The structure that emerged from collaboration between Gov. Roy Romer, the General Assembly and all of the stakeholders has allowed Pinnacol to become successful and a valuable asset. Its very success now raises questions about who can claim ownership of that asset. Moreover, no successful business remains successful if it fails to change with the times. Selling one line of insurance in one state has been a good business plan to this point, but it is risky going forward because the workers' compensation marketplace is changing.

Even a fraction of the estimated influx could overwhelm Clayton's schools, Tennill said, where some grade levels have exceeded optimal class-size targets.

The real turning point was 2004, when the general consensus was that oil was going to be $20 a barrel, and then prices started to go up. That year, Chinese oil demand increased 16 percent because they ran short of coal. And today, China uses more energy than the United States. They use half as much oil, but probably by 2020 they will catch up with us. China's impact can be felt in every part of the global energy market.

Most cruisers will want two to three changes of clothes each day: comfortable, casual clothes for sightseeing in port; more formal evening wear for dinners on the ship; and sportswear, whether it's a swimsuit for basking by the pool or athletic gear for hitting the gym or running track. But that doesn't mean you have to bring along 21 separate outfits for a seven-day cruise. Think versatile. Some port wear can double as evening wear. Two pairs of slacks can be worn on alternating nights, indefinitely. As you choose clothes for your trip, a good rule of thumb is: If you're not going to wear an item more than three times, don't pack it.

“After 120 days, per DCS policy, those records were destroyed. Fortunately, the school maintained records,” Dvorak continued in his letter. “Had the school not kept records there would be no way of knowing what, if any, investigation had ever been undertaken by DCS. … A statute should be enacted to assure citizens there is oversight of DCS. While I am confident there are other examples of the need to make sure DCS records are accessible, I can imagine no example more compelling than the beating death of this child and the serious bodily injury to his brothers.”

At the same time, Christie will have to chip in far more to the public employee pension system as a result of a reform bill he signed last year. Christie’s office refused to disclose details of the budget in advance of the speech.

Thus, the referendum is unconstitutional in process as well as substance. What part of equal protection for every person is hard to understand? I guess all of it for all too many in Maryland with its long history of ethnic and racial hatreds.

Gingrich also toured OTTO, a company in Carpentersville that fills historic old brick factories on either side of the Fox River. The stop was intended to highlight Gingrich’s focus on innovation. The firm was founded by Jack Roeser, an engineer with an idea for a rotary switch. He started in his basement with a $5,000 investment. The company now has about 500 employees and, Gingrich said, contributed about 800 separate parts to the Space Shuttle.

Jack Cauthen has worked in the bike business long enough to see all kinds of trends, from the rise and fall of mountain bikes to the uptick in road racing and the current shift toward urban riding, cruising and touring. A longtime employee at City Bicycle Works in midtown, he became concerned that the shop was throwing away used equipment that could probably be repurposed.
Penalty: Cantona was arrested by police and convicted of assault, although he successfully appealed a two-week jail sentence and instead completed 120 hours of community service. United suspended Cantona for the rest of the season and the Football Association extended the ban to eight months—a punishment that was made worldwide by FIFA. Cantona also lost the captaincy of the France national team over the incident and never played for his country again. The player later said he was wrong to attack Simmons but acknowledged that it had given him "a great feeling."
In college, I was once told by a professor that I was the most unorganized person they had ever met. I took that to heart. I kind of changed my thinking.

In Posey, you have a superior defender behind the plate and an elite talent handling the Giants' elite pitching staff. With the power to hit 20 home runs and drive in 90 runs a season, that's an All-Star catcher. That's a rock, a solid foundation to build on.
Before “Draw Something” was all the rage, “Temple Run” was possibly the most pervasive free mobile game of the 2011. If you missed the boat on “Temple Run” the first go round, grab it for free and become addicted. It has that quality of a simple game that seems easy but gets progressively tougher, where you want to restart the second your little adventurer falls into an ancient chasm. This is also a must-download if you really enjoy the first few minutes of “Raiders of the Lost Ark.”

Just eating right and exercising for 30 minutes a day will help prevent not only diabetes, but also a variety of associated health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease. People who adhere to a healthy lifestyle look and feel better for longer than those who are overweight and sedentary.
Scott. I am a fiscal conservative and would like to see money saved by privatizing prisons and charging the State employees 3% toward their pension plans. Naturally the employees union fought this and got a friendly Leon County Judge to see it their way. Leon county has more State employees than any other county and the Judges who live there are influenced by their friends and neighbors, many of whom are State employees. I'm pretty sure the Florida Supreme court will see it differently.
So Kyle, four years older than his sister, helped however he could. That meant playing with her in the yard, or being patient with her when she wanted to be with him while he lifted weights in the basement, or building those summer vacations around a trip to visit her.

The "Spring Desire" program opens with a rush of anxiety and passion by way of Edwaard Liang's "Age of Innocence," created for the Joffrey in 2008 and set largely to Philip Glass' uncharacteristically melodic and sweeping Symphony #3. A fiendishly difficult piece that suggests both the formality of a 19th century ballroom and the psyches of 21st century men and women, it is now being danced with superb authority. Mendoza and Villanueva were beyond exquisite in the gorgeously romantic "First Dialogue" sequence. A dazzling male quartet (Raul Casasola, Aaron Rogers, Ricardo Santos and Temur Suluashvili) was clearly fueled by high-stakes competition. And the skeletal but ravishing and impossibly flexible Jaiani, paired with her ideal partner, Calmels (a giant of a man who flies across the stage with the freedom of a great eagle), were breathtaking.
Occupation: High school student and possible Olympian gymnast.
I pounded out a quick email and included my phone number. About two days later, I got an unsigned email back from that account. I’ll share some of the message: “(I) am the owner of the home and i bid for a portion of petroleum land a while back in West Africa and fortunately I just won the bidding so I had to move quickly down to Africa to have my company set up because I still have to rebid for it in the next 4 to 5 years.
Hamilton, 66, has actually been trying to retire for the past year, but his work won't let go of him.

Since then, the trade has been analyzed with the same fervor with which the entertainment media dissect a Kardashian romance. Pundits have argued over which team got the better emerging player and whether the Mariners rooked the Yankees by sending them damaged goods, something both the Yankees and Mariners deny.

"It made sense in terms of not just religious freedom, but also in terms of politics," Gibson said. "A lot of these groups that will be affected are groups that essentially support Obama's agenda in terms of social justice, budget priorities and taking care of the poor."
What’s happening here, he said, is that the mere possibility of a huge oil shortage has created an atmosphere of fear in the commodities market, the forum in which oil futures are traded.

The flurry of missives would offer historians and buffs of the world's most famous shipwreck a trove of information, lending a sense of immediacy to events long past.
Whicher eventually pressed the local magistrates to arrest Constance in Saville's murder. He found much that was persuasive. Her stepmother was cruel to her, giving her a reasonable motive for revenge. Her schoolmates testified to her open dislike of Saville and her other half-siblings. There was also an alleged strain of madness that Constance may have inherited from her mother. These were circumstances far more serpentine and complicated than a lovers' tryst interrupted. Although Whicher scoured the estate grounds, the missing nightdress -- which he believed would have been stained with Saville's blood -- was never found.
She argues that it is better to have all officers trained in crisis intervention, because all officers at some point encounter someone in emotional crisis.

At a time of Gilded Age inequality and record budget deficits, every Republican candidate wants to LOWER taxes on the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations. Romney and the rest, for example, are for eliminating the inheritance tax that applies only to the wealthiest 0.3 percent of families. That would add about $1.3 trillion to projected deficits over the next decade, forcing deep cuts in basic services and in programs like Medicare and Medicaid.

What I've described may not sound like an hour's worth of exercise, but believe me, it is. In part that's because Parker took her time and made sure we consciously noted and savored each stretch.

Republicans called the Democrats’ efforts a spectacle.
Poison, drugs and wrist slashing are all potentially fatal, but in each case there's a window of time in which victims are open to second thoughts. With death imminent, their lives might seem more valuable or the cost of their death to family and friends too high. So they call 911, a friend or a relative. With a leap from the bridge, second thoughts are useless.
"I'm told they said, 'This is a Taj Mahal,' " said Capt. Alejandro Castillo, the organization's top administrator in Pasco. "The Army, for many years, had managed money from legacies, wills and trusts. We owe zero on this building. We are honoring people who trusted the Army."

Enter the intersectional, or Itoh, peonies. This hardy cross between the herbaceous and the tree types has produced a peony that takes the best from both camps. Itohs have the vigor of herbaceous types but the ability to flower in milder zones characteristic of the tree peonies. Intersectional peonies aren't entirely new, but they have become more readily available in the trade and are showing up on gardeners' radars. And that has brought an ever-increasing selection to retail nurseries.
Winnings can be redeemed for a chance to win some great prizes.
Wayne refused an ambulance, but returned to the nursing home, where his wounds were treated.
His voice is now a teakettle hiss, and he no longer possesses even the modest range he enjoyed during his band’s heyday. Luckily, the Embassy Brats — his support vocalists Catherine Russell, Cindy Mizelle, and Carolyn Leonhart-Escoffery — quite literally had his back, standing behind him throughout the show and propping up his conversational delivery with rich harmonies. The Brats’ lead vocals on "Dirty Work" felt like a substantial improvement in reading comprehension compared to the original version on Steely Dan’s debut album, which was sung by a slightly clueless vocalist who was quickly shuffled out of the band.
The center also reported that where crimes occur in the state can play a significant role in the nature of the crime.

That's slower than China's 9 percent growth last year, but still the strongest of any major economy in the world. Many Asian economies are already contracting and expected to shrink further in 2009.
Ferguson was calling attention to city contracts that included a little known "public benefit clause," which required companies that win contracts with City Hall to donate money to a charity. Taxpayer advocacy groups say such donations, though not illegal, come with almost no public scrutiny and create relationships that give the appearance that companies are trying to curry favor.

Terry Conley, state and local tax partner at Grant Thornton in Southfield, said the budget the Bing administration presented last week was a good first step.

"There is a lack of understanding, a preconceived image, that having backyard chickens means dirty, stinky, noisy, neighborhood-roaming birds and unsightly coops," she said. "I will not have an ugly coop in my backyard, with noisy, smelly birds. The hens can be maintained inside the coop and inside my fence, with wing feathers trimmed, if necessary to keep them contained."
OF Coco Crisp drew his first start of the season at DH on Sunday; manager Bob Melvin said that was a nod to Crisp's recent illness, plus the A's playing a day game after a night game.

How much do they talk about it off the field and out of our meetings? I’m not really sure. But it doesn’t seem like it’s been a distraction.

In a review of a show at Radio City Music Hall in February, New York Times critic Ben Ratliff wrote: The 90-minute show had unusual pacing: It revved high nearly all the way through.

3. The movie completely rewrites how Katniss acquired the mockingjay pin, and in a sense, this change plays better as a plot device. But the change means we also never meet Madge.

After some consultation, Susan and I settled on a place for a romantic weekend: the Hotel Drisco on Pacific Avenue in residential Pacific Heights. The hotel is set among the mansions and gardens of San Francisco's wealthiest neighborhood and looks more like one of the city's trademark low-rise, stuccoed apartment buildings than a hotel. The Drisco has housed guests for more than 100 years. Its 40-odd rooms and suites still exude turn-of-the-last-century charm, but recent renovations and indulgent service ensure contemporary comforts and amenities. And, of course, there was plenty of fog to envelop us.

ø10. Mike Santos (Florida assistant GM). He probably made a good career move by joining GM Dale Tallon in Florida because Tallon delegates responsibilities. Santos is doing payroll, salary cap and hockey operations and has a higher visibility than he had in Nashville. Tallon is well-liked around the league and could help Santos move ahead.

Scam artists stake out ticket machines and ATMs all over the world. Out of the blue they appear, like technical angels, to give you the benefit of their local gadgetry experience.

I knew a little about the league, but the league is much better than I even thought. So I’m disappointed for our seniors. While they’ve been a tremendous influence in laying down the foundation of the program’s future, I wanted desperately to have more of a tangible difference between the past and this year.
