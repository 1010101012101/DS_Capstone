Smoking: Disks between the vertebrae have a soft center — a nucleus pulposus — and a tougher exterior, annulus fibrosus. The disks absorb shock and vibration when you run or walk. To stay healthy, the disks need nutrients and water, and smoking restricts the circulatory system from providing both.

The Tigers handled an Oregon team that most acknowledge as one of the best teams in the nation. Boise State beat Georgia in Atlanta in what was basically a road game. Although the Bulldogs aren't in my top 25, they are still at least a middle of the pack SEC team that Boise handled pretty easily.

Still, Schwartz, the coordinator of the Music Business Program at New Jersey City University, had to wonder whether the rise of tuition-based rock schools was a sign of troubled times. "We’ve suffered enormously from state budget cuts," says Schwartz, 57, "and music is always the first thing to go. Much of the encouragement to play traditional orchestral instruments isn’t there anymore. Many parents are now weaned on rock, and ignore other forms of music," says Schwartz. "Are School of Rock parents seeing their way back to the public school system and demanding that all arts be taught?"
Part of that could stem from the fact that most voters, 65 percent, like the idea of a tax on the wealthy to support schools, but 52 percent of those surveyed said they don't like the sales tax increase.
Cecil Fielder always will be a part of Detroit sports history, just as his son now will make his own name in it. It does seem sad that the father watched the game alone in Atlanta, while the son played in Detroit.
"I'm happy to contribute, because last year I didn't get any opportunities in the major leagues," Arias said. "In the previous at-bat, I got a fastball from the middle out, and I was looking for a similar pitch. I got it, and that's why I was able to hit it that way."

City officials in Macedonia, meanwhile, say their city has been clobbered in recent years by the near-collapse of economy.
Why did Israel choose blood over diplomacy? Precisely because it could not have achieved its broader strategic aims through talks. Indeed, Israel may have feared that negotiating would enhance Hamas' image as a responsible interlocutor and one capable of disciplining an effective cease-fire.

House Republicans ought to come back home and tell us why they haven't lifted a finger to pass this bill. They are truly the terrorists living in our midst, and the Senate is not behaving much better. Are they seeking to destroy the U.S.? Better to lift this country up to the standards it once held. This requires courage, dignity and integrity as well as some honesty. Please love your countrymen as you love yourselves.

Designers cited street style as an influence. Prada can also be credited, or blamed, in part for the trend. Last year, in its Spring 2011 show, the influential label's collection was so ripe with banana prints and monkey motifs that some bloggers dubbed it the Carmen Miranda line. The house threw in clashing stripes for good measure.
Kehoe said although he agreed with Jordan that school district funding is a state issue, he mentioned that the city needed a more immediate solution and spoke in favor of using the entire $914,000 from the library fund.
Will the Golden State matter to Republicans after all? After Rick Santorum's strong Super Tuesday showing, and Newt Gingrich's win in Georgia and his vow to press on through the Texas primary in May and the California vote on June 5, it's possible that this state may finally enjoy the clout it deserves.
At times Friday, the jury could be heard from the courtroom laughing from inside the deliberation room. Jurors asked for a dry erase board, magic markers, highlighter pens, and paper clips.
The most memorable number in "Return" was the finale, the "Monster Mash"-up. Throughout the show the cast had problems keeping crisp diction and energy levels up.Those issues were put aside by the sheer energy that the cast put forth in the final number. Another vital aspect of the show was the orchestra, "Will Hardy and the Space Cadets." The student-led band provided excellent accompaniment to the show while staying true to the out-of-this-world spirit of "Return to the Forbidden Planet."
To commemorate John's 90th birthday, LIFE.com has posted an online gallery of 25 previously unpublished photos of Glenn.

Guerra said another factor in L.A.'s improved race relations may be the greater inclusion of previously excluded groups in the city's politics, economics and other aspects of civic life. And a third may just be the passage of time since the violence, which left 54 people dead, more than 2,300 injured and caused nearly $1 billion in property damage.
Romney: Lower taxes, less regulation, balanced budget, more trade deals to spur growth. Replace jobless benefits with unemployment savings accounts. Proposes repeal of the (Dodd-Frank) law toughening financial-industry regulations after the meltdown in that sector. Proposes changing, but not repealing, the (Sarbanes-Oxley) law tightening accounting regulations in response to corporate scandals, to ease the accountability burden on smaller businesses. "We don't want to tell the world that Republicans are against all regulation. No, regulation is necessary to make a free market work. But it has to be updated and modern."

"Bo showed too much ambition," Yang said. "Was Xi Jinping scared of him? I'm sure he was."
The notion that Saudi Arabia can make up the shortfall from an Iranian disruption is impossible. Saudi oil too must pass through the narrow sea lanes of the Strait. The trans-Arabian Petroline that terminates at Yanbu can carry only a few million barrels per day, and a rush project to double its capacity would require an estimated $600 million and some two years of construction and chemical changes; this presupposes Iran would not simply attack the line with a barrage of medium range missiles from its Red Sea forward ports.

Last month, he wrote a letter to the U.S. education secretary asking for a federal review of the plan to merge Rutgers-Camden with Rowan, suggesting it was a power grab by Norcross to boost the credit rating of Rowan, which has reached a borrowing limit in its commitment to build the medical school.

Davis, the star center and college basketball’s player of the year, thanked Kentucky for "letting me come here and follow my dream." Davis is expected to be the first player taken in the draft.
In my opinion, barrier building is synonymous with co-dependency and the out-of-control PC mentality that has taken our culture by the throat. It presumes collective responsibility for actions that are individually self-destructive. We are not responsible. You are not responsible. The person who commits suicide is responsible.

It's possible to go overboard, though. On carrots, for instance. Eat too many of those, Heber warns, and your skin, especially on your palms, can turn orange to a not necessarily lovely extent.
"I haven't questioned my confidence all year," said Crawford, who hit 30 wins for the second consecutive season. "I'm really confident. No matter what has happened, I've been able to stay pretty even-keel. Now, whatever has happened in the regular season, we've got to look forward to the playoffs."
Partly because of the $2 billion trading loss, JPMorgan said it expects a loss of $800 million this quarter for a segment of its business known as corporate and private equity.

Schumaker, who played all nine innings at Memphis on Thursday, rejoins the lineup in center field. Schumaker was 3-for-13 in four rehab appearances for the Triple-A Redbirds.
Also hanging over the budget process are two more pressure points. The state Supreme Court, already the subject of a fierce tug-of-war between the two parties, may throw a bomb into the entire process by forcing the state to spend more money on education. Plus there’s redistricting, the once-a-decade chore of redrawing legislative districts that already has the parties sniping at each other.
Are they kidding? If it had been Bush who ordered the hit on Bin Laden, the Republicans would have wanted to make the day it happened into an instant national holiday. Instead they send out Sen. John McCain to issue a statement about the President who kicked McCain up and down the Electoral College four years ago.
General Motors Co. recently launched its entry in the near-premium segment, the Verano. Based on the Chevrolet Cruze, the Verano is the first compact model offered under the Buick brand in the U.S. since the slow-selling Skylark was dropped more than a decade ago. GM also has a new, smaller Cadillac model due out in the fall, the ATS, that it is positioning as a rival to BMW's 3-series.

Santos has responded wisely. His presidential tweets have praised the FARC's decision as "important and necessary," though he has reiterated his demand for a cease-fire. He's right, of course, to demand more given the guerrillas' other abuses; they continue to use land mines, recruit minors and attack civilians.
Arts and crafts: Want to capture the stunning scenery in non-digital form? Local artist Roxanne Broadbent teaches ages 14 and up how to create an acrylic painting Thursday mornings in Wailea. The three-hour, outdoor class costs $65 per person; call (800) 232-4604, ext. 51, to reserve. If you'd rather buy your own souvenir than paint one, some 30 local artisans display their wares at the weekly Aloha Friday Craft Fair at the Westin Kaanapali Ocean Resort Villas, held from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on the resort's oceanfront lawn. I've also had good luck scoring seed leis and handmade jewelry from vendors at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel and the side of the highway heading east from Kapalua.

Obama's signature health care disaster, aka Obamacare, is about ready to crash and burn as a hostile Supreme Court majority seems poised to declare some or all of it unconstitutional. But Brown's administration pushes ahead full speed with California's health care exchanges, setting in motion government as overlord of private health care insurance, who may sell it, at what prices and what benefits it must include.

Ohio gives an ideal vantage point to see how the two parties are battling. Democratic campaign workers are poring over the 1.3 million voter signatures collected to repeal the collective-bargaining law, in hopes of pinpointing swing voters: Democrats say 10% of the signatures came from registered Republicans, 24% were Democrats and independents accounted for 65%.

Raley's offered to meet under federal mediation. But on Friday, Jacques Loveall of the United Food and Commercial Workers said he'll be scheduling a strike vote in response to Raley's "erratic bargaining position."

The phrase—battling everything—could have been the mantra for Game of Thrones’ second season on screen and off. Based on New Mexico novelist George R.R. Martin’s fantasy-book series A Song of Ice and Fire, Game of Thrones follows the brutal quest for power among several ruling families in a sprawling mythical kingdom. Its initial 10-episode series order was considered a risky move for a premium network best known for contemporary shows like The Sopranos and Sex and the City. Though the sexy vampire drama True Blood proved that a supernatural series could succeed on the network, the high-fantasy genre was still considered so...so...nerdy. Television’s last hit fantasy series was the syndicated Xena: Warrior Princess, and no TV show had ever pulled off combining swords, sorcery, and R-rated sex and violence. When Thrones premiered to lavish critical praise last April, the network granted it a quick renewal. “Our biggest goal is passionate engagement,” says HBO programming chief Michael Lombardo. “And Thrones has rabidly passionate viewers.” But only about 2.2 million people tuned in for the initial airing, which isn’t so hot when a network spends a reported $50–60 million on a project. Then something strange happened. Fueled by word-of-mouth buzz, Thrones’ ratings went up. And up. Martin’s novels leaped onto best-seller lists, moving a staggering 8.4 million copies in 2011, including his newest Song of Ice and Fire installment, A Dance With Dragons.

That's how David Anthony - he teaches English at Southern Illinois University Carbondale - opens his first novel the black comedy "Something for Nothing." From that point on, life dips dramatically downhill for Anderson.

Pinocchio, as rendered here by Robert Fenton, is a jackanapes with puppy-dog eyes. Fenton's physical resemblance to Prince Harry is surely coincidental, but it is a potent subtext all the same — a spoiled, ginger-haired boy on a surreal bender.
After receiving a tip, CalPERS determined that Romero's position qualified as full employment and counted toward the 960 hours — about six months — annuitants can work each year, spokesman Brad Pacheco said. Between Romero's tenure in La Puente and five months in Huntington Park, it seemed clear that he had exceeded the limit.

"Our focus now is Wednesday, and the guys that were here for those past series against Detroit know that we have to try to make it a three-game series," Legwand said.

However after careful discussions with the President Obama, Speaker Pelosi, Elizabeth my wife and close friends, I have decided to cast avote in favor of the legislation. If my vote is to be counted, let it now count for passage of the bill, hopefully in the direction of comprehensive health care reform. We must include coverage for those excluded from this bill. We must free the states. We must have control over private insurance companies and the cost their very existence imposes on American families. We must strive to provide a significant place for alternative and complementary medicine, religious health science practice, and the personal responsibility aspects of health care which include diet, nutrition, and exercise.

Last year, when the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals curtailed the Federal Communications Commission's powers to punish networks for "fleeting expletives," many worried that network television would become a battlefield of exploding F-bombs and barely bleeped C-words.

The purpose of my day at the French Laundry was to observe, yes, but also to work. I'd attended culinary school, staged at Jean Georges in New York City and worked the line at Gramercy Tavern. I may not have been up to French Laundry caliber, but I could peel a carrot. Yet somehow, every time I asked to help, someone deftly moved me to another part of the kitchen. "Have you met so-and-so yet?" "How about lunch in the garden?"

1990s- TV in the 1990s might be more familiar to today's generation. ABC's "Thank God It's Friday" slogan promoted Friday nights on the couch with the family. Shows like "Home Improvement," "Full House" and "Seinfeld" were all extremely popular. "The Simpsons" became a megahit on FOX and the 90s was a time when many different channels could compete for the most views.

There's very few chefs in the city that would come into my restaurant and I wouldn't help them with anything I can," he said. "That's the core of it, what makes it so magical, and what will make it grow long-term."

If nothing else, the Blazers were consistent Sunday night in winning their eighth consecutive home game. They moved the ball with precision on offense, played physical and smart on defense and controlled the tempo at both ends of the floor. In his postgame news conference, no matter what question he was asked, McMillan seemed to mention the Blazers' defense -- and with good reason.

Not knowing exactly what would fit for my family. So for a while there, I couldn't leave any dropped fruit. Anything anybody had on a tree, I was there to rescue it. There was one year where -- it was the first year -- I made tons and tons of plum jam. It was like "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof." It was the hottest day of the year. I didn't have my outdoor kitchen yet. I was in my slip. That does not look like Blanche DuBois. That looks like Harriet Fasenfest in a slip. With gray hair. I didn't even like the jam. So it was learning there's a logic to it. You know, we approach it as fashion as opposed to being about form and function. The way we do it, everybody rushes to do food preservation or get chickens, but you really have to incorporate or understand it in the larger context of your life. So that was my biggest mistake. Making things my family really didn't want to eat.

Galt had its beginnings during the Gold Rush, when a group of farmers settled around the banks of Dry Creek, a small stream near Galt. In 1869, the town was laid out by the Western Pacific Railroad, and rancher John McFarland named the community Galt after his hometown in Canada. In 1869, the post office opened at Fourth and B streets. According to the city website, by the year 1880, Galt had two general-merchandise stores, a variety store, a hotel, a harness shop, two blacksmith shops, two saloons, a meat market, three physicians and one attorney. Today, some of the 100-year-old buildings in the downtown core are under renovation to reflect the community's roots. The Galt Chamber of Commerce website celebrates Galt's simple, bucolic appeal. Although Galt does not have the hustle and glitter of a large city, the site says, it does have the breathtaking sunsets, the song of a variety of birds and the peace of a quiet countryside.

Not all of those losses would mean putting somebody out of work -- some would reduce employees from full-time to part-time; others could be absorbed through retirements and resignations. Twenty-three licensed employees and 22 classified employees have already announced their retirements this year, said Bonita Maplethorpe, the district's chief financial officer. Ten other licensed employees have resigned for various reasons, she said.

Obama doesn't divide us, but the most inequitable distribution of income since the 1920s does, when it also dried up demand and caused unemployment. Dividing us is the fact that in 2009 the average CEO for the largest companies earned $9.6 million, as middle-class wages stagnated and benefits were lost. Dividing us is the fact that some of the highest-paid executives in Minnesota who, according to the Star Tribune, received up to $600,000 in yearly perks, while 45 million Americans earned less than $15,000, qualifying them for food stamps.

And that's the spirit of so much of the food at Ammo, whether it's flatiron steak with skinny grilled asparagus, wilted radicchio and a touch of aged balsamic vinegar or the terrific braised lamb osso buco with Bloomsdale heirloom spinach, white beans and tapenade. Among my favorites: sumptuous thick grilled pork chop with grilled bacon and a punchy mustard served with a creamy spring onion and potato gratin.

But the vast majority of U.S. companies base their hiring decisions on the need to fill critical skills shortages, gain a talent advantage over competitors or ramp up production to meet customer demand. Companies don't hire for altruistic or patriotic reasons. They hire for economic reasons: The cost of each new employee, according to the company's calculations, must be exceeded by the additional revenue the employee will help generate. We call this "profit."

But Diallo's lawyers said the immunity claim is off base. They stressed that the U.S. didn't join in the 1947 agreement, and that an IMF spokesman said shortly after Strauss-Kahn's arrest that he didn't have immunity because he was on personal business during his encounter with Diallo. Strauss-Kahn was visiting his daughter in New York.

Halloween, a new friend at a karaoke bar asked me to explain the significance of the holiday. I said that once a year, spirits come out to play. But I quickly added that it was kids' stuff rather than a serious, religious holiday. Yet in Asia, the presence of one ancestor is a dead-serious belief. This Thai film from director Apitchatpong ("Joe") Weerasethakul, which won the grand prize at Cannes last year, maintains a poker face as it tells a fable about a dying man who returns to his village and communes with dead ancestors in both human and animal form. For those of us untutored in the animist worldview, this meditatively paced film is surreal, spooky and somewhat silly. (9:45 p.m. today and 8:15 p.m. Saturday at Plaza Frontenac) By Joe Williams

Michael Anderson's health problems began when he fell off the roof of a family summer house. Suffering a compound fracture of both his fibula and tibia, Anderson developed blood clots.

Usually, cells with tiny calcium deposits are benign but having them raises your breast cancer risk, so you and your doctor need to schedule mammograms more often. If a "suspicious" calcification ever occurs, there's a 1-in-4 or 1-in-5 chance it's cancer. The good news is that if it is, the cancer's likely to be in an early, treatable stage.
Hey, Phil: The media are allowed to view only the first 30 minutes of practice. There's no real chance to see much of Lewis in that time.

Through the late 1950s and early 1960s, L.A. artists assembled from light, space, color, adolescence, joy and the debris of the city a body of work that investigated and delineated what Los Angeles meant when it was on the verge.

Whose job is it to protect the innocent citizens who are constantly dying? What change has to be done to stop the violence happening today? I believe that the problem falls in the hands of police officers. There are not many police officers placed in the streets. I believe that the police superintendent should take a better look at the areas where most shootings are taking place and, if possible, should open a new police district around the area.

And now I hope Stern punishes World Peace severely. He's not the first NBA player to lash out with a vicious elbow, and he won't be the last. But a stout suspension by Stern would go a long way in establishing a line that should not be crossed. Rough, physical play is part of the business of pro sports, particularly in the postseason when championships and large playoff bonuses are on the table. But there is no excuse for anyone in any sport going for unnecessary shots to the head any more.
AVERAGE: Oscar Taveras, OF, Quad Cities (Low-A). All Taveras has done around two interruptions to tend to a hamstring injury is hit and hit often. Taveras turns 19 this weekend, and he's zoomed into the system as one of the toolsy talents to watch. In his first 18 games with Low-A Quad Cities, Taveras has hit .426/.473/.574. Opposing managers and scouts with other teams identified Taveras as a prospect last season in the Appalachian League, and most commented on his "mature" swing and ability to drive pitches throughout the strike zone. His manager, Johnny Rodriguez, expounded on that description last month when I visited Davenport, Iowa: "When I mean good hitter, I mean barrel on the ball. He puts the sweet spot on the ball in all areas of the zone. That's barrel-adjustment. He puts the sweet spot in every area of the zone. Up, out, down, north, south, east, and west. He puts the barrel on it. All of his foul balls are barreled, from the sweet spot."
Rep. Bob Filner, a Democrat who has been in office since 1993 and represents a California district that runs Mexico's border from suburban San Diego to the Arizona state line, is heavily favored for re-election, drawing much of his support from hard-hit Imperial County, which is saddled with the nation's highest unemployment rate -- 30.4 percent in August.

CHATHAM TWP. — Last November, Chatham Township Administrator Thomas Ciccarone signed a contract with Hunter Technologies to provide phone service to all township facilities, including the Police Department and Department of Public Works.

At the time, the company was not a qualified contractor on the state’s list of approved vendors. It is now.

Too many times, his performance was lacking in big games, with a pointless, minus-4 game at San Jose a couple of weeks ago part of a contest that essentially sealed his team's fate. We all expected Stastny to meet or exceed the two 70-plus point seasons he had in three of his first four in the NHL. But the fact is, he hasn't hit the 60-point mark in the last two seasons.

“We keep him healthy down here and go from there,” Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. “See how we go when we get closer to opening day. I’m not worried about him playing first base.

A. There was a lot of running, and a lot of pyrotechnics, so we were running through pyrotechnics a lot, and that can be scary. If you make a wrong turn, something can explode in your face. But that was fun, too. It was fun to use all that physical energy instead of emotions all the time.

Think a Hawaii vacation in tents is too, well, intense? Consider these camps that offer a variety of accommodations — cabins, lodge rooms or dorms — as well as a place for the hardy to pitch their tent.
