Las Vegas was one of the hardest-hit parts of the country during the recession—the housing market crashed and the casino business dropped off sharply. And many of Furman's clients are in the area. She now gets more short-term projects than she did before the recession, which means her income is less predictable. Last year turned out to be better than expected—revenue was down only slightly from 2010. But she estimates that first-quarter revenue this year was down 13 percent from a year earlier.

If you want something festive, try a sparkling rosé. World Market is a good place to find a wide selection of inexpensive sparklers, plus a free membership entitles you to discounts on certain wines.

The two I chose were the Jaume Serra Cristalino Brut Rosé from Spain, selling at the member price of $6.99, and the Charles de Fère Cuvée Jean-Louis Rosé from France, which sold at the member price of $9.99.

But really, none of that matters. "Ray" is available on Spotify, and it's a great listen. I missed the Lemonheads in their prime, so "Ray" is very new to me. There are obvious influences on it — the Replacements come to mind first — but the Lemonheads weren't afraid of crossing over, or at least writing songs that had the potential to. "My Drug Buddy" offers insight into Dando and Co.'s altered states while recording in Australia. "Bit Part's" male and female vocals add conflict to the self-deprecating but upbeat tune.

"Very frustrating process, but a great outcome in the end," Moore told the Idaho Statesman. "Going into it, you felt very comfortable and confident that you'd get an opportunity to get drafted.

Much of that grip will be in key provinces where current and former military officers are governors and leading political and business figures, managing corporations that build hospitals, villas and toll roads. They have attracted foreign investors from France to Taiwan in companies in sectors as diverse as maritime shipping and computer chips.

The league has had record revenue, with monies from ticket and merchandise sales continuing to rise. Increasing television ratings and contracts, rising franchise valuations and the short line of owners desperate to sell would seem to indicate that owning an NBA team isn't the horrible investment owners would like for the public to believe.
See, in this light, you can say homophobes (and in a similar way racists, sexists, Islamophobes, et al), they have been indoctrinated in the worst possible way. They have been led to their shallow bloodpuddles of misunderstanding by the church, by awful parenting, by violent misrepresentations of God, by shameful media propaganda, bad tattoos and cheap beer and way, way too much professional sports on weekends. Just a thought.
"Now that we have something, it's shareable," Doyle said.

Traveling in Zambia during the dry season is dusty and warm (the vehicles we were in weren't air-conditioned). Our worst travel day was when we shared a ride to Kati's school, riding four hours in the back seat of an old Toyota truck. We were luckier than the school teachers in the back, though; they were sharing the truck bed with our luggage and some big bags of rice.
"I have never felt more pressure in my life than coaching an Olympic gold-medal game for the U.S.," said Auriemma, who was an assistant coach in 2000 when the Americans won gold and is charged with heading the 2012 Olympic women's team. "It overwhelms me, to be honest with you. And I wasn't even born here. It's not your town, your school, your state. It's your country. Now I know why the guys playing World Cup soccer behave the way they do. I feel like a little kid out there."
“What I like most about (theater music) is it’s not predictable,” he said. “Especially in a revue setting, such as Quality Hill, you can play a two-hour show and run the whole gamut of emotions. I don’t mean just physical emotion, but musical emotion. … There is so much room to interpret a great majority of this music. You can really show a personal touch, a personal feeling, in a way you can’t do with other music.”
Likewise, Wendy Wang, of East Palo Alto, said her parents told her, "apply where you want to, and once you get in we'll figure it out." Until last week she was weighing an offer from the University of Southern California -- but its $4,500 annual grant wasn't enough to offset the $60,000 cost to attend. Instead, the Menlo-Atherton High senior decided to attend UC Berkeley and major in mechanical engineering.

"PSE&G does not sell power to NY. This project is needed for reliability — period," she said.
The governor's move came less than a day after Democrats pushed through a bewildering package of phantom revenues, fee increases and time-release deficits. California's seen this movie before under both parties, and Brown showed good sense in rejecting a rerun.

Partridge brought an alluring, sultry innocence to the role. Still, her soprano, while expressive, sounded a little pushed, without the same level of purity or suppleness that she has revealed in previous MOT appearances. Ford's Zurga was full of fire and fury, almost like he wandered on the set from a Verdi opera. Bass-baritone Andrew Gray handled the smaller role of the Brahmin priest with aplomb.

The practice frequently associated with the spectrum of obsessive-compulsive personality disorders has been noted throughout human history. Those who hoard papers or mementos or clothes -- whatever it might be -- do so, says Dr. Johan Rosqvist of Pacific Psychology Clinic, because they think they might need the items later, believe they need them to trigger memories, or because they simply love their things and want to keep them.

In Bings latest draft, he would relegate an outside financial advisory board to make recommendations, but would not have the power to enforce them.

“There wasn’t much of a music scene,” says bassist Zachary Carothers about his upbringing in the city that launched Sarah Palin’s political career. “I went to see any act that would come up to Alaska, but we were drastically limited.

As the suppliers these days to Sutter Home, Gallo and Mondavi Woodbridge, Lodi growers are the giant silent partner in the wine industry, pumping out fruit for much of that "California"-labeled supermarket wine, and even for blending with fine wines sold under tonier regional labels, including those of the Napa Valley. But there's a twist, and it goes a long way toward explaining why Lodi wine country is such an interesting destination right now. Consolidation has pushed down bulk grape prices and squeezed family farmers into reinventing themselves as winemakers, bottling their own fruit and getting in on the action. They've even divided the federally recognized Lodi American Viticultural Area into seven new sub-appellations. Jessie's Grove and most of the other wineries lie in one called Mokelumne River, a prairie that straddles Route 12 west of downtown Lodi. That's also where you'll find the new Lodi Wine & Visitor Center.

Patriots coach Bill Belichick. And now a gasser for the football side of things. With four years to stew on the Super Bowl XLII loss, that’s the best effort you can summon out of your team? Yeah, there were only a select few left on the roster but Belichick should have been able to communicate what that game meant for him, Bob Kraft and everybody else who still felt the sting of that night in Glendale, Ariz.

Puggi has previously said the casino expected its market share to drop while it was remodeling major parts of the casino, temporarily reducing the number of slot machines and tables available for play.

They might not be the last, either. The conversations the FBI recorded between Dimora and others suggest he flaunted his ability to get suburban mayors like FitzGerald and Cervenik on the phone in an effort to impress benefactors like Neiheiser and Forlani.

"Mirror Mirror" has all that stuff, only in different contexts. And it has Lily Collins and Armie Hammer, as well, to say nothing of Julia Roberts, chewing scenery as if she hadn't been fed in months. Good thing, because as reinventions of fairy tales go, this one has some pretty big holes. Not all of the twists on the story work, but for the most part it's well-meaning, goofy good fun.

And evidence, they said, indicates Balfour was near the Hudson family home in Englewood on the October 2008 morning that Hudson's mother, Darnell Donerson, 57; brother Jason Hudson, 29; and 7-year-old nephew Julian King were fatally shot. The boy's body was found three days later in an SUV stolen from the Hudson home.

While the broader economy showed signs of recovery, the part of it that matters most to most of us - the job market - remained stuck in low gear. The unemployment rate fell, but much of that was due to people dropping out of the workforce. The St. Louis region added just 5,900 jobs over the last year, growing by just 0.5 percent, and there are still 70,000 fewer jobs here than before the recession.
Community Service: Along with other activities, my main community service opportunities have been through my involvement with Simply Green Club. Since the club's creation during my sophomore year, the club has organized multiple student-run beach cleanups in the community. While being president this year, I have led beach cleanups on several local beaches, including the Balboa Pier beach and the River Jetty beach. Newport Harbor High School students and I spent hours removing trash from the beach to prevent such debris from polluting the ocean and killing sea life. Another activity through Simply Green Club has been our multiple bake sales. Over time, our club members have gradually raised money for environmentally focused organizations. My sophomore year we raised $1,000 for the Surfrider Foundation, and this year we plan to donate our funds to the Sierra Club.

Still, the president sought to draw attention to the bill and the image of cooperation in a town that is sharply divided along party lines and moving no closer together in an election year.

For instance, some brokerage firms might opt to report the cost-basis information on certain exchange traded funds while others may not, says Stevie Conlon at Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, which helps brokers track this type of data.

It provides more technical tips and fewer recipes (which they call "exercises"), but it's a useful tool for anyone anxious to brush up on, or learn, kitchen skills.

Clearwire's network has a few problems: it's based on a broadband technology that the rest of the industry has bypassed, which means the selection of compatible devices is limited. Because of the frequency it uses, the signal has difficulty penetrating into buildings. Both Sprint and the cable companies used Sprint's slower cellular data network as a fallback option, but NetZero's devices rely only on Clearwire, which means coverage at decent signal strength may be spotty.

Audiences who saw his most recent film graded it a tad higher than any of the weekend’s other new releases, giving it a B-plus CinemaScore.

6 Scotch brands never get old, they just invent new ways to age whisky. The Balvenie has released several wood-finished expressions over the past few years using multiple barrels that each held different libations, like bourbon and Port. Its new SherryOak is different in that it was aged entirely in Spanish Oloroso sherry butts for 17 years. And Glenlivet's 16-year-old Nadurra (Gaelic for "natural") goes in first-fill ex-bourbon American oak casks so that it sucks up more wood flavor from the barrels. It's bottled at cask strength (more than 57 percent alcohol by volume) and not chill-filtered, all of which results in a cloudy whisky but one with a creamier mouthfeel. Balvenie SherryOak: $99.99, John Walker and Co., 175 Sutter St., San Francisco, (415) 986-2707. Glenlivet Nadurra: $57 at BevMo.

Good fortune this prolific can't be chalked up to luck.

The experiments haven't led to a solution yet, said Dan Legard, the commission's research director, though there's "promise." But growers need more than a maybe, he said. With $20,000-per-acre up-front costs, a grower can't afford to lose a field of strawberries to disease.

Every time Gimbel mentioned a trendy drink or recreational drug, he asked how many of the high school juniors and seniors had heard of the product, seen it for themselves or knew someone who had tried it. Invariably, dozens of hands went up.
Here and there the digging comes up short. Why exactly did Kennedy ignore his brother Bobby's advice and select Johnson as his running mate? Mr. Caro doesn't say. And why did Johnson pass on the chance to offer constructive advice during the Cuban missile crisis (which presumably led JFK to cut his veep out of the crucial final meetings on the matter)? Particularly jolting is Mr. Caro's laudatory treatment of the Warren Commission charged by Johnson to report on the Kennedy assassination. Rather than deploy the historian's benefit of hindsight and point out its serious investigative lapses in the apparent interest of putting the whole shady matter to rest, he praises the now widely ridiculed commission (on which my grandfather served, I should disclose) as one that helped a nation "build confidence" in the new president. (While conspiracy buffs will be riled by Mr. Caro's statement that "nothing I have found in my research leads me to believe that whatever the full story of the assassination may be, Lyndon Johnson had anything to do with it," most of us will probably be relieved that the narrative doesn't wallow in innuendo.) In this single instance, it feels as if Mr. Caro found himself on a narrative roll and wouldn't let LBJ's expeditious but hardly heroic commission slow his story's locomotion.
Mladic faces charges of genocide and other war crimes for atrocities committed by Serb troops under his command during Bosnia's 1992-95 war, including the notorious Srebrenica massacre in July 1995 and the 44-month siege of the capital, Sarajevo.
She led me to backstage areas of the greenhouse that the public doesn't see, where dozens of pots of lilies crowded a light-filled growing area. These are 'Nellie White' lilies, which are grown in the Pacific Northwest and reach about 12 inches tall.
“We felt like we left a lot of open shots on the table,” Pietramala said. “We threw the ball to places where the guys were open, but they were covered. They weren’t open for shots. If we had thrown the ball to a different spot, we felt like we had guys open for shots or if we had thrown it and then thrown one more pass, we would’ve forced them to rotate off the attack. So it was obvious in the second half that Maryland decided that they didn’t want to rotate off the attack very much.”

If Dodgers fans are uncertain if the team’s new owners will spend big, it is very possible the rest of baseball already believes.
The reason for the irritating delay was because the NHL and NBC wanted to make sure the New York Rangers advanced on Thursday - they did - so they could be featured in key TV slots (see item below about East Coast influence). Although that contest ended early, fans wanting the official schedule still had to wait until well after the last first-round series, New Jersey beating Florida, ended. Meanwhile, the NBA put out its first-round playoff schedule Thursday while West Coast games were in progress.

In written prose, it’s easy to say that Arya’s slight frame and tomboyish attitude help her pass as a boy with the other characters. However, Gendry can see as plainly as the viewing audience that “Arry” is actually Arya, giving her reason to come clean with the late king’s sire. The cautious banter and rapport between these two gives hope for what is shaping up for a long, arduous journey on the war-torn path north.
This was Virginia's sixth national championship, and first since 1994. Akron (23-1-1) lost, 1-0, to Duke in its only previous finals appearance in 1986.
Check into a hotel. It doesn't matter if it's only a block from your house; having people taking care of you, sheets you don't have to wash and food you don't have to cook brings out the best in all of us. Order champagne and watch pay-per-view movies. May I suggest Mumm Napa Brut Rosé ($16-$18), a dry and well-made little wine with a Valentine's Day tinge. Pretend you're on a prom date.

He's a dedicated educator whose assumptions about Quebeçois culture and curriculum can be a bit off the mark. He lightly cuffs a boy who's being a jerk, tenderly pats a student's head or shoulder here or there, and assigns writing tests from demanding novels that aren't on the list. He's unsure whether to break up a snowpile game of King of the Hill or let the horseplay run its course. He marvels at Rice Krispie squares, too polite to show how appalled he is.
3. Lead regions are "getting it" — grasping that with weakened state and federal governments, they have to figure out their own futures. Symbolic: dozens of mayors are forming coalitions for collaboration in such cities and regions as Chicago, Denver, Philadelphia and Minneapolis-St. Paul. Denver prospers with an enhanced reputation from its courage in adopting — and largely paying locally for — an ambitious regional rapid rail system. Ditto the Los Angeles area for the Alameda transit corridor, enhancing the regional economy, reducing congestion and cleaning up the air.

Answer: Yes. You gain knowledge on the patient-care process and working with physicians. From education in a nursing standpoint, you advance education in your community as well.

In the nearly 30 years since Balanchine's passing, it feels as though the soul of his ballets has incrementally diminished in a way that's hard to put a finger on but perhaps is embedded in the loss of small but significant details. In "Divertimento No. 15," which Balanchine devised to the music of the same name by Mozart, pure classicism meets jazzy sparks in fiendishly difficult choreography, and yet although everything seemed to be correct and steps in their proper place, what was once distinctively Balanchinean can now feel like a generically pleasant tutu ballet.
