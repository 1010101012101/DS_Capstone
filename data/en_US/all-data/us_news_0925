What has gone away is a rational foreign policy and appreciation for our long confrontational history with Russia. As confirmed by its later behavior, Russia's early support of Germany's World War II efforts promised to net the Russians the entire lot of crippled or destroyed European nations, including a weakened, if not annihilated Germany.

I am tired of the hawks' view that every Middle Eastern episode of tension can be solved by military force. True, Iran has said it would "wipe Israel off the map." But this talk — absurd on the face of it — sounds like the posturing of a street corner punk.

As a rule, anti-war war movies just don’t sell,and “nuance” doesn't cut it on a realbattlefield.

Footage from last night: Gladys and Tristan seem to be having so much fun together; both of them are grinning from ear to ear. Melissa had fun dancing that routine, even if the judges' comments weren't great. Len and Bruno start singing "Maria" from "West Side Story" as they wait for Maria and Derek to show up. It's kinda cute. Maria admits that if a judge wants in the bedroom, you say yes. I can't believe how much I've warmed up to her since the first of the season.

Hayes is the first live-in partner of an Oregon governor, at least that anybody can remember. She also takes up residence in Mahonia Hall under an unusual amount of scrutiny because of controversy over a state subcontract that went to one of her Bend-based sustainability firms. Documents seen by The Oregonian show that she lobbied the Energy Department to apply for federal stimulus money, some of which eventually went to her four-partner company.
Small wonder that L. Ron Hubbard had the creative chops to parlay his 1950s self-help system, Dianetics, into a worldwide religion — and a very lucrative one at that. Hubbard was, after all, a science-fiction writer, a dreamer, a charming teller of tales and the inventor of much of his own history: He fabricated or embellished aspects of his military service, education and personal adventures, not least of them his purported run-in with a polar bear in the Aleutians.
Sean Meagher: A legit and athletic seven footer who can block shots, rebound and give you five to eight minutes a night. Plus, he's a steal for what he's making next season.

Cue the cliches: you can't teach size and you can never have too many bigs.

NEWARK — An undated photo, probably from the 1940s, depicts men relaxing at the “Kaffeneion to Kronion” in Newark. The men in the foreground are smoking water pipes. The establishment’s name literally translates to “coffeehouse (dedicated) to Kronion,” another name for the god Zeus, and might have been known more colloquially as the Zeus Coffee House. The coffee house’s street address of “283” might have been on West Market Street which, according to the Newark Public Library, was known as the center of the Greek section in Newark. The library’s archives note that Greek-owned businesses thrived in Newark from the late-19th century through the end of World War II, with numerous restaurants, coffee houses, bakeries, flower and candy shops, barbers and hat shops located throughout the city. Demographic records show that the city’s Greek neighborhoods grew smaller following World War II, when the benefits of the GI Bill combined with economic prosperity allowed many urban dwellers to relocate to the suburbs.
As to Social Security being a valid program, much as changed since its inception. People with disabilities were not recipients in the early days.

This tablet computer carrier (in this case, an iPad 2) features a grid of interwoven rubberized strips that allows you to secure all manner of tech flotsam without having to worry about what cables, adapters and gadgets fit in which pockets.

The solid, flat center piece is oversize, so if the loaded Wrap falls on its end, the tablet computer doesn't take the hit.

I read with great interest the Brookings Institution study on job creation in the Baltimore region reported in The Sun on April 23 ("'Next economy' envisioned for Baltimore area"). The study was admirable for its call to action — a robust effort on the part of all key stakeholders to create jobs for the "next economy" and for a comprehensive inventory of education and workforce training resources to prepare our citizens for these jobs. As this collective effort gets underway, there is a segment of low income residents that cannot be neglected — the over 8,000 ex-offenders who return to Baltimore City, and many more to the greater metropolitan area, every year after their incarceration.

I can't tell you how many reporters have interviewed me for stories about "why women are divided about Clinton." How about a story explaining "why men are divided about John McCain"? In fact, gender as a factor in men's voting is one of many elephants in the political room, even as male (and female) candidates slaughter innocent wildlife, sit through endless NASCAR races and profess their love of hot dogs and beer.

There are numerous other diseases and problems that can affect all parts of the eye and its surrounding structures. Acuity of vision is not routinely measured in cats. It is normal for a cat's lens to thicken with aging and for clarity of vision to diminish. Very few felines go blind unless another condition is present. If a cat loses vision in one eye, often an owner will not even realize it because it will still be able to function fairly normally. Even an animal blind in both eyes can get around in surroundings that it is familiar with, because it will utilize its other senses to compensate.

"Over the last three years, the tide has turned," he said. "We broke the Taliban's momentum. We've built strong Afghan security forces. We devastated al-Qaida's leadership, taking out over 20 of their top 30 leaders. And one year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. The goal that I set -- to defeat al-Qaida and deny it a chance to rebuild -- is within reach."

Most human resources professionals advise against office romances. In light of the serious risks involved, executive recruiter Brian Drum, president of Drum Associates, warns "before engaging in a workplace romance, be prepared to give up your job if necessary in case of a bad break-up.

If you are not prepared to give up your job because you really love it — don’t engage in a workplace romance."

Your first stop should be at the Dahlonega Visitors Center on the town square to pick up a map of the wine trail. Don't limit yourself to the two wineries where the festivals are held. Give yourself a full weekend, or longer, to experience all of them. Each winery is different from the next in feel and character. Some exude homespun family farm charm, while others come off more like big resort operations. At one stop, you'll find yourself sampling the latest vintage inside a barn building next to a log cabin; at another, inside a large villa with a 20-foot-long marble-top bar. All of the wineries offer tours and tastings, some complimentary, others costing a small fee for a tasting flight.

And on this blustery night the half-dozen white-curtained cabanas are occupied by friends eating and drinking the night away. No worries that the place is going to close up on you. The late-night menu continues where the dinner menu leaves off.

A cousin of Za'Zell's, Catrina Diggins, wearing black dance tights and a lavender skirt, performed an interpretive praise dance to "Let Us Worship Him."

But the upset renews questions about whether Romney can win over conservatives who have been cool to the former Massachusetts governor.

The common thread in these exposes is connivers in the Legislature and City Hall diverting millions from the rest of us to the favored few — themselves and their cronies on the fringes of government, usually bosses in public employees unions. In so doing, the pols have imperiled the pensions of public workers in state and city plans. Illinois' plans are underfunded by an estimated $83 billion, Chicago's by an estimated $20 billion. Depending on how the funds' investments perform in future years, the real shortfalls could be much, much higher.

In opening Tuesday's hearing before the U.K. Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport committee, Mr. Murdoch said it was "the most humble day of my life." Seated next to his son and fellow News Corp. executive James Murdoch, he conceded the company had made mistakes in the saga, which involves allegations of intercepting voice mails and paying bribes to police.

FACT: The truth is feel good hormones released during sex can produce feelings of bliss and help protect women's hearts, too. These feel good chemicals help improve hormone levels. Sex can release enndorphins to help ease stress, often a contributing factor to heart disease. In fact, serontonin is said to boost bliss, and help improve a woman's mental outlook, helpful in staying healthy. A surge in oxytocin (often called the cuddle hormone) during sex can help enhance couple's bonding, intimacy and closeness, important to sustaining long term relationships. After sex, dopamine is said to drop, and it may trigger a restful sleep in couples, especially helpful to women who may find sleep evasive as these bodies start to change.

And that house is going to sit there."

When choosing living room furniture, keep the proportions of your space in mind. Oversized furniture in a small room can be overpowering and can compromise traffic flow, while pieces that are too small produce an environment where the space, rather than the people in it, dominates. Create a sense of balance by choosing furniture that is the right size, shape, and scale for the room. For example, a love seat and a small club chair are well-suited for a small living room, while a grand living room needs a sectional or two adjacent couches plus an armchair with ottoman. Play with your space and hand-picked pieces to create your perfectly balanced living room.

The Impact, who lost to the Timbers on a goal in the 90th minute on June 4, had won three consecutive games since that loss. Montreal (5-5-2, 17 points) consistently forced the action on Sunday through rugged play in the early minutes of the match -- an obvious attempt to intimidate the Timbers.
The same question appeared on the first-round application, submitted by the Corzine administration on the deadline on Jan. 19, which was, coincidentally, the day of Christie's inauguration. New Jersey did not make the list of 16 finalists that time around, when two winners were announced in March.
