In their findings, a bubble's biography begins inside a microscopic cellulose fiber clinging to the glass surface, usually fallen from the air or left by a towel. Gas builds up in the fiber as champagne splashes into the glass. When the combination of pressure, surface tension and viscosity is just right, the fiber starts leaking bubbles, the researchers said. Once settled after pouring, a glass of highly carbonated champagne effervesces at the rate of about 400 bubbles per second, compared with a rate of about 150 bubbles per second for beer, they reported. Champagne bubbles also are more flexible than beer bubbles, which affects how long they linger at the surface before popping.

By the time we settled on the third-floor bar with its tall, skintight-catsuit-clad femme fatale barkeep and overly weathered couches, I couldn't decide if I was underdressed or overdressed (read: too much clothing on), or if I should just shut up and drink.

CD 101.9 dug her music, and she has been called a “smooth” jazz vocalist. Don’t hold it against her, though; and remember that Oleta Adams can sing pop, rock, R & B and church music with equal skill.

And when she lets loose on a piece of devotional material such as “Power of Sacrifice” — a song she wrote — listeners are likely to catch some religion. If you only know her from her Gulf War-era ballad “Get Here,” here’s an opportunity to become better acquainted. 8 p.m., $35 to $65, visit njpac.org or call (888) 466- 5722. — T.M.
One saxophone teacher, Dann Zinn, urged him to treat daily practice sessions as if he were an athlete training for the Olympics. Stephens did that, while taking advantage of jazz programs at UC Berkeley, the Golden Gate Library in Oakland and the Stanford Jazz Workshop, where he studied with pianist Barron.

Contemporary country music has suffered through a similar crisis. Surely there are still remote parts of America that are untouched by highways, mega-malls and McMansions, but Nashville is not one of them. The "country," as it was generally understood when Kitty Wells and Roy Acuff were recording, has practically disappeared. Modern America is a triumph of technology over folkways, skyscrapers over silos and black asphalt over rolling fields. But it is not a triumph of urban music over country music, and that is because the "country" has been successfully and thoroughly redefined by its finest artists. It is no longer a place on the map, but a place in the heart.

The company was forced to make its first ever layoffs, of 120 employees, one-fifth of its workforce. Chouinard began to wonder whether he should stay in the game at all. He went to famed consultant Dr. Michael Kami, who recommended that Chouinard sell Patagonia for $100 million and just use the proceeds to do environmental good. "I seriously considered it," says Chouinard. "But I'd made the same mistakes every other company makes. I decided the best thing I could do was to get profitable again, live a more examined corporate life and influence other companies to do the same."

The rise of the internet has made a new arena in which it is possible to make lots of money with far fewer startup costs than the industrial giants of yesteryear. Rockefeller may have needed oil refineries, but now some coding, a laptop, and an idea can make for a wildly lucrative product. Even Gates and Jobs had a higher barrier for entry to their markets than some of today's web entrepreneurs, says Winship.
The letter is the second way in which Thomas' former players have voiced their displeasure with the firing in recent days. Members of the team silently walked out of an athletic department banquet on Monday night immediately before the season's basketball award winners were to be announced.

Despite reservations about Pakistan's commitment to U.S. goals in Afghanistan and doubts over how bin Laden managed to evade capture for so long, the Obama administration feels it has little choice but to ally itself with the country.

As the singers who joined the protest know, success is not just about raising a powerful voice -- they need to act, too.
And he didn't see any fair comparison between his own school visits and the president's. The main difference, Greer said, is that he didn't have the Department of Education organizing lesson plans meant to idolize him the way he's convinced they would have for Obama, had Greer not stopped him.
The Rangers spent more than 150 days in first place. The Giants spent only 17 after May 1. Yet for all their torture, the Giants never played an elimination game this season, they never trailed in a postseason series -- and they clinched three consecutive times on the road.
Randi is behind on the mortgage and is hoping to use a chunk of that money to get caught up on it and on the bills. She needs some for medicines, too. She'll get through the month. The kids help her some, but they have families and bills of their own.
“The single factor that may explain over-involvement in pedal misapplication crashes at both ends of the driver age distribution is poor executive function.

Finger said he believed that the Charlotte, N.C., company also could feel the wrath of institutional shareholders, many of whom own Bank of America as well as Citi stock.
For the nonvoters, "taking a walk" is the equivalent of voting "no," because passage requires a majority of all 80 Assembly members. There is a pattern to this walking: In the vast majority of cases, the bill involves something average Californians care about - often consumer or environmental protections - while powerful corporate interests stand in opposition. Legislators prefer to euphemistically refer to this practice of avoiding what they were elected to do - Take a stand! Make tough decisions! Vote! - as "laying off" a bill.
Their effects have been felt in Nebraska, where Democratic Sen. Ben Nelson was preparing for a $50-million reelection race before he announced his retirement last week. Although aides said the early spending by anonymous donors didn't trigger his decision, Nelson knew that the 2012 budget would have doubled the state's previous record — $25 million spent during his last reelection.

A: It was great. It's a experience that I think if you are an amateur and playing in the tournament you should probably do it. There is a lot of history with staying there and I enjoyed it. They do a great job of keeping the history of that place relevant. There are a lot of old pictures of the prominent guys that played a long time ago. They are big on the history of the club and you can definitely feel it when you are there.

Some have worked for the mushroom factory for 25 years, and it's the only work they know.
Automakers and other companies that make big pieces of equipment use stamping presses to mold sheet metal into different shapes. The machines are extremely expensive to make and install, and they're useful only to companies in those trades. To buyers interested in turning the Twinsburg plant into a shopping mall or a warehouse, the equipment would be a nuisance to remove, not an asset to use.
On this site, beauty isn't as pedestrian as "five new ways to wear your bangs." YouBeauty only features a story topic if there's a hook to science.

Friday's decision marked a new beginning of sorts for the often-maligned sex-offender program.
Save a weather emergency, Wimbledon schedules three matches per day on its two chief courts, Centre Court and Court 1. That leaves 10 matches for more intimate courts that have from less than 1,000 to no more than 4,000 seats. In 2008, that meant one could see stars such as Venus and Serena Williams battling on Court 2 (they later met in the final, with Venus winning in straight sets). In 1984, Martina Navratilova, the eventual champion, played her fourth-round match on Court 3.
Tampa Bay 3, Seattle 2 (12 innings): Elliot Johnson hit an RBI single with one out in the 12th inning for the host Rays, who twice rallied from one-run deficits before winning it against Brandon League (0-2), who failed to hold a 2-1 lead the Mariners took on Jesus Montero's homer in the 11th.

“Bernie is sometimes challenging me and sometimes waiting to see what I bring. But rest assured, he knows when to steer it. He likes spontaneity and the creative moment.

Whatever those aspirations may have been, it seems at the time that Nixon didn't imagine his love notes would one day be displayed for the world to see: "No one shall see my writing on this stationery but you," he wrote in one letter, "because you see I have so much to write to you and so many times I have to send you notes!"
Still, the slowdown was sharper than economists expected, and a broad, bipartisan range of academics, hospital administrators and policy experts have started to wonder if what had seemed impossible might be happening -- if doctors and patients have begun to change their behavior in ways that bend the so-called cost curve. If so, it was happening just as the new health care law was coming into force, and before the Supreme Court could weigh in on it or the voters could pronounce their own verdict at the polls.
"My focus is to help the community no matter what happens with the Twinsburg facility," Montgomery said when asked if his mission suggests that Chrysler's decision to close the plant is irreversible, despite some sentiment in the state that it might not be. "I want to work with the mayor, I want to work with the people there. The mayor formed a task force soon after the news came out about Twinsburg. We're going to go and meet with that task force and find the ways to help them support the strategies that they want to put in place."

In succeeding Egan, Dolan would ascend to a powerful seat that has been held, in the past, by influential figures such as Cardinals Francis Spellman and John O'Connor, churchmen who would become as much a part of New York history as they are American Catholic history.
-- Seattle Times: Neeson's character is a man in torment. Early on he's seen chewing on the muzzle of a high-powered rifle, his finger tightening on the trigger. He's in the grip of suicidal despair over the loss of the love of his life, a nameless beauty (Anne Openshaw) glimpsed only in fleeting flashbacks. Can he rouse himself from his funk to lead the other survivors to safety? In addition to his commanding physical presence, Neeson has the ability, unmatched by any other Hollywood leading man, to convey soul-deep anguish. In this picture, it's shattering in its intensity.
“I don’t know,” she added, “that it was an intentional lie.”

The annoying racket predates the arrival of Captain America and his gang for the making of the action flick, which opens today in most theaters across the county.

At 6-5, he's been far from perfect. Those who know Fickell best saw his sideline demeanor as stoic or unflappable, like a veteran head coach who reads the same way in victory or defeat. Frankly, fans might have preferred a little more visible fire when things didn't go well. He didn't use every timeout correctly, started keeping the captains a secret, saw his team start flat the last three games after the season's big win over Wisconsin.
Although officials cannot predict how many city workers will sign up for the registry in the coming week, last year's analysis calculated the potential cost under various scenarios, including numbers of potential participants and their choices of health care providers at different price points, Harper said.

Anytime someone is trying to take down the incumbent, the burden is on the challenger to make a persuasive case for change. We don't believe Bode has done so.
Romney pronounced himself appalled, accusing Obama of having "railed against arguments no one is making" and "criticized policies no one is proposing." Yet Romney could neither defend the cuts nor deny the president's list of particulars, based as they were on reasonable assumptions. And when Obama went after the right's willingness to use the power of the Supreme Court for ideological purposes, conservatives were aghast - and never mind that conservatives have been castigating activist judges since at least the 1968 presidential campaign.
The U.S. team was composed of the three top-finishers in individual saber -- gold medalist Mariel Zagunis, silver medalist Sada Jacobson and bronze medalist Rebecca Ward -- and was a huge favorite in team saber.

Wornum says he had no qualms -- "none whatsoever" --about leaving his son, Arthur, alone to continue on the show. At the beginning of the season, Arthur weighed 510 pounds. Taking his body mass index into account, Arthur was the biggest contestant in the history of the show. During the season, Arthur has struggled at times, as his size made some of the workouts especially challenging. Though in the episode that aired last week, Arthur had a breakthrough weight-loss of 20 pounds.

Perry, spent three years documenting the pioneers of the trending "slow-flower" movement in their recently released book "The 50 Mile Bouquet: Seasonal, Local and Sustainable Flowers" (St. Lynn's Press; 2012).
It's hard to estimate exactly how much the '51 Giants gained by concealing a coach in center field with a telescope at the Polo Grounds, but it's easy to assign them an unfair advantage. The same goes for the Patriots and the Saints. There's no reliable way to assess the impact of strategic espionage or injury slush funds on the success of those teams, but the problems posed by being implicated are also incalculable.
ROBERTS BROTHERS ON THE BRINK?

The conventional wisdom that the valley has embraced about SOX's impact is simply wrong, and the attempts to demonize it for the vanishing IPO have been wasted energy. The good news is that a number of players across the innovation economy have begun to realize that, and they're at last opening a more reasonable, productive dialogue about how we can reboot the IPO.
 The first disagreement concerns the role of private industry and ensuring innovation. Privately held communications networks happen to be our public's critical infrastructure. For example, private networks such as those controlled by Internet service providers  AT&T, Comcast and Verizon  carry 80 percent to 90 percent of all Internet traffic: government, military and private. Some believe the private companies do not have sufficient market incentives to protect that infrastructure and may skimp on investing in security. As a result, the Homeland Security should establish security standards.

Last September, when Manao opened in a Westmoreland strip mall, the restaurant's only chicken wings were prepared Thai-style: dredged in flour, deep fried and served with an oyster sauce-based dip and a spicy cucumber garnish. But after customers complained that these weren't like the sticky, spicy, ever-so funky Ike's Vietnamese wings at Pok Pok, another option appeared. "Manao's Chicken Wings" are subtly sweet, deep-fried and redolent of fish sauce. A few more menacing red pepper flakes and they would be nearly indistinguishable from Pok Pok's.
The stories led one top-ranking union leader, Tim Foley, to resign. It triggered new legislation that, if signed by Gov. Pat Quinn, would stop the practice of basing public pensions on heftier union salaries, prevent union leaders from double-dipping on union and public pensions, and cut off the benefits of two teachers union lobbyists who were able to join the pension system after one day of substitute teaching work.

Service, overseen by Kelly Majid, is enjoyable. Even when the 30-seat sliver of a restaurant is full to the last chair, the staff takes time to explain ingredients and frequently refill the pretty blue stemmed water glasses, which complement the decorative tiles the Majids set into the table tops.

In Kansas City, Pioli and Crennel have the foundation of what could be an elite defense. Tamba Hali is among the sport's best pass rushers and will only be more dangerous if Justin Houston continues to emerge in his second year as a pro.

Groupon says its pitch to sellers is that they can expose their brand or service to consumers, who will then return at full price. Maybe. But it looks more to me like most of Groupon's offerings are from suppliers that are hungry for any revenue they can get.

Once again, Houston has demonstrated its claim to the title of energy capital of the world this week as we've hosted the 2012 Offshore Technology Conference (OTC), the world's foremost event for the development of offshore resources.

The problem with using a combustible gas detector is that they're ridiculously sensitive, and they'll often give false positives. For instance, if there is fresh pipe dope at a fitting, the gas detector will go off. When one finds a leak with a combustible gas detector, it needs to be confirmed by using a gas leak detection solution; it's a liquid that does about the same thing that dish soap would - it bubbles if there's a leak.

“We fully intended to introduce on March 28th, the day after our last round of police contract talks,” Wallace said in a statement released on Monday. “However, due to circumstances beyond our control, those negotiations were postponed and, therefore, we felt it prudent to delay the introduction of the budget.

A GOP-drawn redistricting map threw the longtime friends together as part of a two-seat reduction in Ohio's congressional delegation caused by slow population growth.

Put the vegetables in a 10- to 12-cup baking dish (something that can be brought right to the table is preferable). The filling should reach about 2/3 of the way up the dish; any more than that and it could overflow during cooking.

In fact, why not get rid of all professional sports in Baltimore? Who needs to make our city look and feel good when there's so much misery we could focus on. Once we clear out those loser Orioles, we can get rid of auto racing, football, and of course the biggest drain of taxpayer money, horse racing. Then, once we've stamped out every last trace of civic pride, we can turn all of our tax dollars to feeding the indigent and scraping the dead bodies off the sidewalk. Now that's the Baltimore we all know and love!

I completely agree with how the Buckeyes are handling the quarterback situation so far. I think Bauserman has shown enough in camp to earn the starting spot and give the Buckeyes the luxury of easing Miller into his role.

Usama, born in 1095, was a warrior, a courtier and a distinguished man of letters, a witness to the Crusades, and therefore to the encounters that created the conflict between the Islamic world and the West. This book contains his autobiographical writings and firsthand accounts, and it's full of amazing stuff. "One of the most spectacular spear-thrusts that I witnessed was inflicted by a horseman from the Franks (may God confound them) on a horseman from our troops, called Sabah ibn Qunayb -- from the Kilab tribe. It cut through three rib-bones on his left side and then through three on his right. Finally the sharp edge of the spear-head struck his elbow joint, splitting it in two just like a butcher does with a joint of meat. He died instantly." Usama writes about bloody conflict with a cool eye, and with feelings about the strangeness of the other side that probably haven't changed much today. Newly translated by Paul Michael Cobb.
