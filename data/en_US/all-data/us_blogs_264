Hey. Did I ever say the odds were in our favor? Look at 6000 years of human history. Our exceptional approach - dividing power so that we can sic mighty elites upon each other, so they won't prey on us - has always been a creaky, nervous bet. It mostly worked for the last two centuries, but only because people kept upping the ante on reciprocal accountability, the transparency and competitive processes that give us positive sum games. It is what's worked and it might continue working...
Q. Very cool. So how did you - how did the (producers of the show) find you?

While I was celebrating my boyfriend and mum, I didn't have time to change my manicure so I was wearing a silver chrome with a crackle on top. The result was a bit sloppy so I didn't take any pictures ;) I finally had time to change my manicure, and I took one look at my untrieds and knew I had to try the original version of Here Today... Aragon Tomorrow from OPI.
No sooner had I landed from that flight of fancy and finished this piece, when I thought that perhaps I had not fully entered into the spirit of the challenge as I hadn’t used everything in the pack, and I had also substituted some of my own beads for the seed beads sent to me. It was the last day of the challenge by now and I knew it had to be something relatively quick to make – something that didn’t involve 8 feet of peyote rope! I began looking at the labradorite again, and in the sunshine, it reminded me of the colour of the sea, deep swirling sea with mythical creatures beneath the surface. The pearls seemed to complement the marine theme and yet the seed beads whispered that they would like to become flowers, fantasy flowers. I imagined a Selkie, trapped in human form as her husband had hidden her sealskin. I saw her standing on the shore, looking longingly out to sea but unable to return to her home, and that is when ‘In a Selkie’s garden’ came to life.

David & I did contemplate getting "plugged in" again. We even went so far as to set up an appointment to have everything hooked up again. Then I pushed the install date back another 3 weeks, to think over it some more... & last week, David finally said, "No, let's not do it again." We've realized it's not a huge deal to us anymore, since we have access in other ways. I check my email on my cell phone... he can get online at work... & on days like today, when the kids & I need an internet fix :-) we just come to the local library, where we can all surf at the same time to get it out of our system - & all for free, of course.
I felt defeated. I felt like after all this, with only 3.5K left, I was going to have to walk the rest of the way. I would jog a little, but my legs wouldn’t let me go. People I passed long ago were all passing me. I thought that the boyfriend, his sister and his dad had to be done by now.
I read this blog at least 5 times a week; Mr. Creekmore has obviously invested a good quantity of time and effort on developing a top notch blog site. The articles, usually guest posts, are packed with information, well thought out and most importantly to me, varied. To my mind the backbone of this blog is the community that Mr. Creekmore has grown, called “The Wolf Pack”. These folks make this blog; not only helping to write contend but they comment freely, providing nuggets of information gleaned from experience. Another reason that I really like the wolf pack and Mr. Creekmore is that, while they might disagree with each other, the discussion is always well moderated and civil; there is nothing I detest more than vitriolic responses to posts.
So, dear readers, I've been uncharacteristically quiet this month. The reason is that I'm in a minor depression and I can't quite gain the traction to crawl out of the little pit of despair I've ended up in.

"The performance was followed by a little birthday party for Avery in the Dining Hall. Avery is now 13, an accomplished student. Karla was especially proud of Avery and excited to get together to celebrate Avery's first birthday as a teenager. It was as perfect a family afternoon as we could hope for. Had we known it was our last day, it would have been heavy, overbearing, not the gift that it was, light hearted, buoyant, playful. As we walked out to our car to drive home, Karla handed Abby a purple balloon that one of the staff in the dining room had given her. And Abby, distracted for a moment, lost hold of the string and the balloon rose up into the sky. No one was very much concerned. The girls are almost too old for balloons. But there was something about it, as it rose into the sky that struck me, and I felt drawn to watch it. So I stood there, away from the group, feeling a bit silly, almost obstinate, and I stared after the balloon as it rose into the gray sky. Abby wandered over, and grabbed me around the knees and watched with me. Every now and again asking "Do you still see it, Dad?"
Saul of Tarsus was blind and he knew it. He had to come to the end of himself before he would say yes to the Lord Jesus Christ. Every true believer has come the same way.

I became aware of these developments by word of mouth, but I was to discover later on, by personal experience, the terror of Quatro, to name but one death camp. People were removed from amongst us -- taken to Quatro or Camp 13 -- and disappeared forever without reason. Many of them were slaughtered by one means or another and their ultimate destination was a shallow grave. We heard rumours of execution by being buried alive, amongst many other techniques beyond civilized imagination. The purge created great fear amongst all of us, to the point where the smallest criticism, such as of badly prepared food, was seriously reconsidered by every individual, for one could never be certain that a 'best friend' would keep his mouth shut.

I already had on hand) and a (generous) splash of white wine, plus some more seasoning. Cook until everything heats through, simmering for a few minutes–also let it simmer to keep it warm/reheat it. I also had some leftover brown and basmati rice, so I mixed those together to serve the sauce/chili-like mixture over.

The recipe instructed me to do this as many times as I could stand (up?) and I was disappointed, given my diligent skimming, to see thick legs of grease running down the sides of the empty pot after my first straining manoeuvre. I washed the pot (using industrial quantities of washing-up liquid to dissolve the fat) and repeated the process eight times, cursing the still lardy pot - which by this time was nearly running out the door - and the diminishing returns of my precious liquid. At this point I gave up and decided just to bag the damn stuff and be damned, divided what was left (precious little!) into poly bags and went to put them in the freezer...

By contrast, the darkness we encounter on Holy Friday is experienced with the benefit of hindsight—we know that the light of resurrection is coming. For this we can give thanks, but perhaps such hindsight leads us astray by diminishing the despair the disciples felt on the day of Jesus’ death.

The upgrading of informal settlements has two phases. The first involves the provision of infrastructure services: roads, stormwater, water, sewage etc. The second is the erection of a top structure (the house). It is essential to ensure that the two phases are aligned. If concrete toilet enclosures are provided on each erf during phase one, they must be removed in phase two in order to incorporate the toilet into the house. This means an additional cost of R4,000 per erf. This amount has to be deducted from the R75,000 subsidy for each family's top structure. This means, in practical terms, that a concrete enclosure in phase one, will result in a house in phase two that is two square meters smaller than it would otherwise have been. If you enclose your own toilet in phase one, it can be incorporated into your house in phase two, and you will reap the benefit of a bigger house. This is why families choose to enclose their own toilets in phase one. It is an empowering and logical choice. That is, until the ANC Youth League decides otherwise.
Those of us who were watching were incredulous. We had just witnessed David getting rid of the perfect solution to his problem! What better way to get a horse to stand still so you can walk around him than to give him a bucket of grain?

The Hewitt family tried to get away like everybody else, but when the military started attacking civilians, they fled into the woods and found this hidden shelter. They've been here ever since, hiding. And it's gone pretty well. Except they're finally running out of rations and will need to find food somewhere else – not an easy task since going to the surface is the equivalent of suicide.

A little while back, I was very privileged to be help out at photographer Murray Noble's exhibition, The Flower Show. Not knowing what to do with himself after a long career as an architect, Murray took up photography in his retirement, drawing inspiration from the gardens at his beautiful home. Murray's works merge three separate photographs to create new and exciting images entirely. And the results? Exquisite.

I’m from really bad jokes retold (again!) by Dad over Sunday dinner and good-natured laughter anyway, from plays on a high school stage and the minister visiting for supper with his blue linen and pearl-collared wife. I’m from the day I met my dad’s best friend who will always be known by his first and last name together, and from the time a man visited from the other side of the world and I wondered why he wasn’t upside-down, and from the shadow of the woman in the doorframe selling my mom painted eggs. I’m from spaghetti on Thanksgiving because nobody ever liked turkey, from ice-cream sundaes on New Years and brown bags of popcorn on movie night. I’m from five sack lunches distinguished by sketches of us siblings front and back per bag to make us laugh, and from tiny finger sandwiches so we’d feel like we were giants, and from a whole summer browning at the pool with Mom, and from the last Christmas dinner with Grandma at Olive Garden. I’m from hot fudge cake with my dad for birthdays, staying home from school to watch the cat have kittens, and head-to-toe poison ivy. I’m from sneaking through the woods with my brothers, Barbie in the basement with my sister, and whole-grain cereal on Saturday mornings. I’m from stealing my dad’s brown socks from the dryer and gathering in the kitchen with my siblings on Christmas day to watch Mama make holiday pizza.
No one has yet answered the question as to how Mr Murray qualifies as a “fit and proper person” having been a Director of a football club in the five years prior to an Insolvency Event. Although, as the SFA Chief Executive Stewart Regan said, the test is a “myth” and the SFA relies on clubs to fill in the forms correctly, if Mr Murray does gain control, then as long as he ticks the correct box, the problem is solved!
Israeli political sociologist Avishai Ehrlich explained to me that despite Shas's apolitical and strictly religious facade, the voters who support the party are fundamentally as hawkish (if not more so) than the supporters of Likud. Shas knows this, and as such represents the vocal interests of this community. (This realization comes after seven years of malevolent anti-Arab rhetoric from the party's spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, language that was largely dismissed as the ramblings of a religiously brilliant but hopelessly bigoted blind man.)

Hallie and Albert used to spend their days walking from the center of town up the street to my grandparent's farm just up the road from us. They would visit several people throughout the day, passing gossip from house to house, smoking their corncob pipes and umm-umming between gossipy tidbits. Albert had nicknames for everyone--I was Goldilocks, a neighbor was Little Penny P...., No Bigger than a Dime, there was a woman called Itchyfoot. They were legends in our small town.

The films continued with the bloke joining AA and getting his life together, and the woman refusing AA and falling into a life of alcoholism and casual sex. He tries to help her but she doesn’t take it, misery ensues for all. In the closing scene we see the woman walking away past a neon “Bar” sign as the bloke looks forlornly on. The misery of drink in case we’d missed the point. The only redeeming feature of the final act was the coy way the film dealt with the woman’s sexual promiscuity. Inferring it in the way films of that era did with anything sex related. It made me think of those Doris Day films where a married couple share a room but sleep in two separate single beds.

The key to a good scam is to have a willing victim. If, in fact, the outcome of the scam is something which the victim would be quite happy to achieve, then it makes it even easier to pull off.

His only really new argument is to insist that because the Catechism says that the terram was placed in the “midst” (in media) of the mundus, this must indicate that the terram was placed in the exact center of the mundus and therefore refers to the earth being placed in the exact center of the universe. But this doesn’t follow of necessity. The Catechism, in this section, is drawing from the language of Genesis 1. Gen 1:9 says that God gathered the waters in one place and the dry land (terram) appeared. So it’s perfectly reasonable for the Catechism to say that the land was placed in the midst (in media) of the earth. That no more implies that things have to be in the center of the earth than me saying “I hiked in the midst of the mountains” means that I was at the mountains’ exact center.

I was absolutely blown away the first time I tasted Torrontés. It had a nose of tropical fruit and flowers, not too dissimilar to that of a Gewürztraminer; but with slashes of refreshing citrus. It was intense, crisp, and richly perfumed. My experience was all that and then some. I had not been this excited about an aromatic wine since I learned how to pronounce Viognier properly!

It takes place in the 2030′s, uses technology that doesn’t exist now and postulates that Japan never turns their declining birth rate around. All hallmarks of a SF story but it doesn’t feel like a SF story which is something I’ve noticed more frequently when the Japanese do SF as opposed to in America. Another series that is a SF story but doesn’t’ really feel like a standard SF story makes it into my top 5 at #5.

Its plot from what I can garner is that Kate Beckinsale and company are going after humanity this time instead of werewolves (The werewolves are to apes as vamps are to humans in the Underworld - Planet of the Apes continuum).

It's a well-known fact to any indie aficionado that 1986 was a year where endless singles in childishly designed sleeves suddenly fell into branches of small independent record stores. The accepted wisdom was that the contents of each would be either be naive approximations of The Smiths performed on Argos guitars, or deeply fragmented, barking mad experimental discs.
Sun Ra is noted to have been a member of the session group, however I can not confirm any group members for Dan & Dale LP other than the group's albums titled Batman and Robin (which is available online for purchase download and is credited to Sun Ra by other online sources).

One of their stand out beers for me last year was S.C.A.NS IPA. It was a juicy cornucopia of hoppy loveliness in aroma and taste that got it's name from the Simcoe, Citra, Apollo and Nelson Sauvin hops used in creating the beer. So, when I heard that they had just produced a beer called S.C.C.A.NS IPA, I knew immediately that I just had to get my hands on a bottle or two and give it a try.

I made an easel giftcard for a change. The card itself is made around a box of toffifee which cost me £1 from poundland. I removed the outer sleeve which leaves the chocolates still in their protective covering and used the sleeve as a template to make an outer wrapper for the box. I then made an easel card the same size as box which I attached to the box when it was decorated. It was quite easy to make and makes a nice (cheap) thank you gift! The papers and design are quite plain but I wanted the main focus to be on the image. If it wasn't a sample for TV and I was giving it away myself then I would probably make a matching box but I didn't bother.

I learned one thing in recent years , it is Our heart that sings the unchained melody of love , it doesn’t posses , doesn’t smother .. just loves and sometimes there is a duet sometimes not but the song remains eternally beautiful. It is complex and yet simple. There is a longing and yet there is a free flow. I want it to be like that .. flowing. No one got anything from caging someone. It is in the spaces that love grows. We just need to open our heart petals. I am doing it and am sure the universe will respond.

After agreeing to do my part, I return to my desk and contemplate on how to secure some woman’s clothing within 24 hours, without having to spend any money. I put out a quick message on Facebook and before the afternoon is out I have arrangements to go pick up not one, but two dresses from nearby friend. That’s right, bitches. I had options. Oddly enough some friends had just thrown a transgender party (don’t ask)not too long ago and a couple of my buddies still had their drag wear laying around. In other words, my cry for woman attire was answered by men. Because I figure I couldn’t possibly be lucky twice in one day I decide not to look for make-up.

If one more person tells me "all that matters is you and the baby are healthy" I'll scream.

But baby girl has made this kind of a cut and dry decision -- I don't have another option, which almost makes it easier!
However, I found the main strength of the book to be within the more personal moments. For example, I particularly enjoyed the exploration of Sarah's feelings and thoughts, her relationship with Katie and their friends, the addition of some potentially interesting characters (whom I don't wish to spoil), and even just the detailing of the lives of Sarah's friends. We're shown a group of people who are still nursing their wounds, physical or otherwise, and who are getting to grips with a world that's been turned upside down, but who still have their own lives to lead. With this novel, Pitts once again shows that he has a flair for blending both personal and global stories, each complimenting the other yet one thread never becomes dominating.

Indie writers shouldn’t consider editing an expense; they should consider it an investment. The smart ones already do. There will be more and more freelancing work in this brave new world. There will be opportunities to partner with agents to set up new companies that help writers with design, editing, formatting, and marketing. And some of them, like Gordon Lish, are fine writers themselves.
So, there are clear concerns about swallow populations (as there are about many other migratory species) and solid evidence for population declines even if some of the causes are not fully understood. It is also a good example of the difference between 'weather' and 'climate' - in very simple terms, climate can be seen as 'average weather'. However, if you have outbuildings (garage, barn, workshop etc), there are some things you can do to encourage swallows to nest - they like to nest on dark ledges and in nooks and crannies, as these stay warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather. They can enter buildings via surprisinly small holes and need very little light (dark areas are at less risk from predators) - my favourite swallow nesting site is at Monkey World Ape Rescue Centre in Dorset where swallows nest high up inside one of the Chimpanzee viewing galleries, darting between visitors as they fly to and from the nest. To encourage swallows to nest in an outbuilding, the following should help:

A while ago I promised to write a response to King Shamus and No One’s post about feminism and motherhood. Their proposition is that the Left would be far more dangerous if feminists would not insist that women work instead of raising children because the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world. I love both blogs, but I don’t think either one of them had the data when it comes to contemporary feminism or left-leaning women.

Put those two developments together, and what you get is a massive disintermediation and disaggregation play. Authors still need the same editing etc. functions they needed before, but now we can get them via a variety of emerging business models, many of which have nothing at all to do with legacy publishing. All of which means that legacy publishing will have to reinvent itself and reprice its drastically reduced list of value-add services if it wants to survive. Meanwhile, with legacy publishing's paper lock broken, new entrants, including literary agencies and authors like Bob Mayer, are offering authors various collections of add-on services for various rates of remuneration. So whether legacy publishing survives or not, today authors have more publishing choices than they ever had before.

I am a student of prophesy. I have also become a student of human nature as a result of my interest in what God is doing. Sadly, over the last few years I have witnessed what appears to be a sharp decline in human judgment in general and in fearful judgment in particular. We have become a society of Pharisees who are more concerned with the letter of the law than the intent of the law. We judge each other vehemently. We have trials and convict someone in our own minds solely based on partial information or false information.
O it stretches—it spreads and runs so fast—O my father,
I recently put my near completed, 1975 Topps Set in sheets. I really had forgot how nice of condition set this was. The colors really pop and almost all the cards have sharp corners. It's definitely my favorite set of the 1970's, if not all-time. Of course, it's probably because my childhood idol, Jim Rice's rookie card is in this set. I have always wondered what made Topps place Jim Ed on a four-player card while the likes of George Brett and Robin Yount appear all by themselves.

I played with the sentiment a bit. Originally the "you are my" was going to be cut out of the card front with the rays on the bottom 2/3 of the card, but I decided to just do it separately. I filled the letters with grey, then got a bit wild and filled the "sunshine" with polka dots. I wanted to make it yellow, but this was soooo much more interesting. We even learned how to scale the pattern down so it works in the smaller letter space. Lookie:

The first step is to submit an I-130 Petition for Alien Relative to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The purpose of the visa petition is to prove to the Immigration Service that the US citizen has a bona fide marriage to a foreign spouse who wishes to immigrate to the United States. The permanent resident process is almost completely petitioner-driven. That means that the person who petitions for the foreign spouse has control over the petition. The foreign spouse cannot force the U.S. citizen spouse to file on the foreign spouse’s behalf. Once a petition is filed, the U.S. citizen relative can withdraw or cancel the petition at any time before the foreign spouse obtains permanent resident status.

Swapping Places: 1. Jason goes to the lower-class showcase and misses his own performance, while Jinguk neatly slips into Jason's place and takes part in the more professional showcase. 2. Baekhee gives Hyemi her lucky medallion, showing that they've truly traded places--B is clearly on top of the world, while H needs all the luck she can get. 3. Pilsook essentially takes Baekhee's place as Hyemi's quieter, gentler friend. Their dynamic is rather different because Pilsook doesn't shadow Hyemi or want to imitate her, but she does look to her for advice and encouragement.
It took considerable self-control to suppress my gag reflex at the sight of Abdel Aziz rushing from the palace to greet the protest march against Biram Ould Abeid’s sacrilegious act, dressed in full al-dara’a and head scarf traditional dress. I know he said that they should forget democracy, that Mauritania is Islamic, and promising swift and sure action. There was also something about secularism, but I confess, I was too dazzled by the crispness of his powder-blue cotton Marabout costume to pay attention. I assume that was the idea in any case. A pretty stage show to mollify the mob. Not only was Aziz in the palace on a weekend, conveniently dressed in his “man of the sands” fashion mockery, he was also able to reel off the names of several distant locations where protests had also “spontaneously” erupted. The new presidential media advisor certainly seems to be earning his keep.

Learning history is a significant part of understanding how people behave from previous examples and of understanding ourselves by knowing our origins. The interpretations vary but the basic facts are consistent. We need to apply the lessons of history to our present circumstances. When aliens are invited in they start to take territory: it is human nature. There are historical precedents to guide us such as when the Anglo Saxons were invited in and then the Normans.
As we grew up, of course, our explorations began to vary. But through those earlier years, the lessons we learned have made adulthood much easier. The TV is not the only option. If it’s nice outside, go outside. It’s not where you’re at, it’s who you’re around. You actually can do this yourself. If you get in trouble, take your punishment and move on. If you’re gonna get punished, make sure it’s worth it. Don’t go it alone-it’s never as much fun, and if shit goes down, you want backup around.
Gladstone's triumphant budget of 1853 secured his place among the first rank of British politicians. He carried it through against considerable initial opposition within the cabinet itself, especially from the two rival aspirants to the chancellorship, Wood and Graham. His budget speech's success derived in part from his mastery of budget history, but even more from his determination to reconstruct government finance in a more rational manner. In a step devised to increase prosperity, he reduced customs duties. He made up for the lost revenue by extending income tax for seven years and also applying to somewhat lower incomes and to Ireland. Since the income tax was unpopular, and Gladstone himself was on record opposing it, the trick was to make this extension palatable. He accomplished this by extending the tax in a way as to put Britain on a path to doing away with it, by setting it at a gradually declining rate (at the end of which it would be expected that greater prosperity would bring in sufficient revenues without it, though from what sources is not clear to me, anyway).

As a family, we give our time and resources in three ways. The first, and primary, is through our parish and other catholic charities. Next, we donate new and gently used goods, usually to our parish and city St. Vincent de Paul groups.

Oh, and a fourth: we support the Girl Scouts by purchasing Thin Mints.
Finding a job is not easy, finding a job in Paris is even more difficult. When I first arrived here my goal was just to find a job, any job in fact.

I had previously only had experience teaching children, however this was a refreshing change, teaching English to French professionals.

Our wonderful nurse brought out the birthing stool, and gave the medical residents attending the delivery the confidence to get down on the floor and assist me in delivering him right there on the stool, in less than ten minutes of heroic pushing. I was amazed at how quickly this stage went compared to the last time, I was prepared for a marathon pushing session and I had hardly got going before he was here, delivered right into my hands. My first impression of Geekybaby was how much bigger he was than Geekygirl (he was 8lb 6oz, and 22 inches long. I'm 5ft 2). He was bright pink, vigorous if a little squashed looking, and immediately demonstrated his functioning kidneys by peeing all over his dad. Meeting the fantastic new little person the second time around was just as incredible as the first.

Abby had asked the same questions and gone over the same details a dozen times, and still she searched for answers. “When I got here this mornin’, Mama was carryin’ on about how the two of ‘em must’ve slipped off to elope–knowin’ how Zanna gets twitchy during the long services.”
I decided to record the rest of the conversation on tape and took my seat on a sofa in front of her. She looked up and I felt a slight smile at the corner of her mouth but the gash on her cheek made it impossible to judge that correctly.
Technique is something that I would usually point the finger at. If I’ve noticed it then it’s been done in a ham-fisted way. American crime shows where everything needs to get wrapped up neatly in 43 minutes are a perfect example; if someone coughs you know it’s a clue. That’s an example of plot done badly. An example of plot done well is the Pinter play which, if you haven’t seen it, runs backwards, beginning at the end of an affair and showing scenes from the relationship going back to the first meeting. Impossible to disguise so why try? And that’s what I liked about this book: she doesn’t hide her technique but because it’s unusual and atypical; it makes us think about why she’s chosen this particular approach.

Kids were home at 3:50pm, right when I was leaving the house. I left Jake in charge, and headed for the battery (where Captain America works) (dang, there's a lot of Army Specific lingo in my language, isn't there!). The FRG leader and I were meeting with the Commander to go over some FRG stuff and to try and schedule dates. The dates were penciled in, cause he didn't know a hard fast set time for "field exercises". Sigh. We tried, though. We penciled in activities through April, I think. Or was it March?
'with some of the other writers I'd been reading at the time, I could feel a slightly judgemental quality in the prose, as if the characters in the story were not so much real people as they were props being used to make wise, sardonic points about the human condition. With Pancake, there is none of this. On the contrary, there is the opposite feeling; his stories' characters are not mere inventions but flesh-and-blood human beings whom he suffers along with, believes in, and ultimately loves, no matter how far they might fall.'This is also part of the reason why writing a satisfactory post will surely prove impossible because whilst reading, when I should be marking passages and keeping an outside eye on my critical response, I came instead under the same spell as Dubus 'moved by all these people and their tough lives'. A first reading isn't enough but I'm not convinced that I'd ever be able to write the perfect post without actually going back to school and studying it all. So the short version: Buy this book immediately and read it when you feel the need for a literary shot in the arm. You won't regret it (and that's the closest you'll get to a money back gurantee from me)
To make a long story short, I have to agree wholeheartedly with Mr. Isherwood here; the implication that mornings (or at least Monday mornings)are good is a highly questionable one, and I’m thoroughly convinced that there’s a niche in the market for a coffee machine with an attached hand that reaches out to slap the under caffeinated human who is negligent enough to forget to add coffee before attempting to brew any, or even better, one that will conveniently add the essential forgotten ingredient, and possibly deliver it to the caffeine addict on a tray, Jetsons-style.

The difference between Leo and Andy is night and day and Giffin did a great job making them both well-rounded characters.

Out here, not far from the edge of the world, the places where we work hide behind boarded windows that stare blindly toward vacant lots of asphalt, pocked with gravel and eruptions of grass. Several buildings have been bulldozed in the three years I’ve lived here. Several more buildings are in need of it. People rarely come to this small town, because they won’t find big box stores or departmentalized conglomerates out here on the fringe. And because we really have nothing to offer them.

Thelonious Monk - Brilliant Corners - 1957
After leaving the Delta, House lived in Detroit and Rochester, worked outside of music, and eventually disappeared into the woodwork until he was found and coaxed back into playing in 1964, and here lies the meat of Beaumont's book. He digs up much new info, including a self defense killing in Long Island in the 50's, and a new source of House information in the guise of Mississippi born, Rochester blues singer Joe Beard who was close to House and who had a very different take on who House was than his new found white keepers. There's lots of interesting asides, including that House was in the audience when the Rolling Stones brought Howlin' Wolf out on an episode of the Shindig TV show in '65, and House's manager being told by fellow human archaeologist Tom Hoskins (who found Mississippi John Hurt)-"What you have on your hands is a nigger". That House would confound all their expectations by not giving a fuck, about the blues, or his white audience, may seem natural from our vantage point, but to his keepers he remained an enigma. And that's what makes this book such a fun read.
The court first noted that the lawfulness of such a system should be assessed taking into consideration the principle laid down in Article 15 of the E-Commerce Directive. The latter provision states that ISPs which offer internet-related services are not required to monitor the information which they store or transmit, nor are they under a general obligation actively to seek facts or circumstances indicating unlawful activities. The court considered that the monitoring system in question infringed this provision of the E-Commerce Directive, as it would require the ISP to (i) identify the peer-to-peer files within all the electronic communications of all its customers; (ii) identify the allegedly infringing files; and (iii) determine which files are illegally transferred and block them. Such preventative monitoring, the court emphasized, would require ISPs proactively to check all electronic communications transmitted on their network, adding that this mechanism was not compliant with Article 3(1) of the Enforcement Directive, according to which the measures, procedures, and remedies necessary to ensure the enforcement of IP rights (IPRs) should be fair and equitable.
Leong added that the lawyers’ monitoring teams also “witnessed numerous acts of police brutality” and said the police’s attitude was not merely to arrest, but was “punitive in nature” that he said “aggravated” the tense situation that unfolded in the latter part of the day.

So I ‘work out’ in concrete and symbolic ways. I go to the gym to build up bulk – using the ‘big boy machines’ and say I have a right to be there. In conflict with others, I try not to immediately apologize or take responsibility in order to calm the waters. I try to allow people and patients to be angry with me. I try to express anger, rather than repress it. I worry less about being a ‘good boy’. Most important, I stand up for injustice. And when I need archetypal guidance, I think of Warriors and derive courage from their bravery.

The good news is, I liked it. It's good and often it's very good. Jennifer Lawrence is awesome; she is an amazing actress and she nailed everything. She had exactly the right chemistry with all the other characters: Prim, Cinna, Rue - and Peeta and Gale. Obviously many things from the book are condensed for the movie, but even though Katniss and Gale only have about five minutes of screen time together, you still got it - that they are best friends, maybe more - and that's entirely due to how much Lawrence can convey with only a few words and gestures. The other actors are fine, but it's difficult to point out anyone else as a standout. It's totally Lawrence's show, and as she's the lead, that's how it should be. There's no doubt that this Katniss can inspire a revolution.

I finished reading one vampire novel and two zombie novels in January. The vampire novel was Breaking Dawn by Stephenie Meyer - the final part of her Twilight series. It was easily the best book in the series. The one character who has annoyed me the most in this series has been the petulant Bella Swann, the heroine of the novels. However, my opinion of her changed once her new husband, the vampire Edward Cullen, transformed her into a vampire. Vampire Bella is awesome!

The cognoscenti amongst you will immediately recognise this as a blatant copy of Jaco Pastorius’ own home-modified Franken-bass.

Perfect for imposter guitar players pretending to be bass players, like me.

Sometimes, I really did take my case studies from life, often from friends of my daughters. They kindly agreed to talk to me honestly about things such as their substance abuse or criminal activities. They wouldn't thank me for using their real names. Of course, books and their case studies vary. In a recent book about careers in vulcanology, I found lots of real vulcanologists and either emailed them or, if they proved elusive, took the information I needed from their professional websites. In a book about drug abuse, I took stories from real friends, but also testimonies from the web, particularly support groups and fora for drug abusers, and changed the wording and the names. Real stories, but with the details changed.
This novel about a girl who is used to being the pretty one, only to have a car accident, go head first through a windshield, and not be so pretty anymore, sounds instantly powerful. It's a complicated subject matter, but if Friend does it well, I feel like the story could be absolutely breath-taking.

The water seemed devoid of life. I wondered why birds were there at all. There was a great expanse of water, without much life to it. I guess it looked very functional like all public places are expected to be. Not far from the water however, we soon snapped a large lizard basking in the sunlight.
I've had the beads for well over three weeks, and I've used some already, even sold a pair of earrings that included some of the lucite flowers. And I'm just today getting around to taking pictures. Shame on me! I also forgot to take a picture of the beads I sent, and I didn't make a list, just sent sticky notes attached to the bags. Yeesh - I guess its obvious this is my first bead swap! But hopefully it won't be my last! I thoroughly enjoyed the process, although it did stress me out a bit - will I send enough? what if I send too much? will she like what I send? - and I fretted over the fact that it took me so long to send out my beads, especially after I got my swap from Lauren. BUT, enough words, here's the beads, let them speak for themselves! Also, a big thanks to Lori Anderson for setting up the swap and to Lauren Potts for being a patient partner and for the lovely lovelies she sent me!
I love your blog and also Heart Organizing.
You're such a homebody. You only really seem happy at home. You're good for a little while out and about but then your done and want your horse and your bed. Just like your mama.

Hey guys~! It's been a while since my last post, sorry about that!
"When is a good time to find the manager here?" I ask.
By Far one of my favorite Quotes of all time by Coco Chanel. I truly believe women should take care of themselves both inside and out. Women these days feel like there is no turning back, as if its too late to change. I say Yes You CAN! About a year ago, I was about 30 pounds heavier than I am today. I'm so happy to say that I have never felt any better about myself. Even though when I was heavier, I still felt beautiful and loved ALL of me, mostly because I knew my value as a person and I knew that I was able to bring smiles to all who came my way alhamdulillah. Now that I am more active socially, religiously and physically, No ONE can stop me. Here are a few pics of me before and the new and improved Yaz. Don't Ever let anyone tell you that you can't do it because they are WRONG. Everyday is a blessing and I think we should all cherish and take advantage of the time we have left on this earth, not only to please ourselves, but also to please the one and only ALLAH swt!

There was a third lady who contacted me to let me know her teen-aged daughter, who was in hospital for diagnosis and therapy, loves reading the Madhouse. I sure hope that some of my silly tales made her laugh.

So more intervention is needed to boost the middle class than just expanding higher education. The first thing we can do is to prevent downward mobility by boosting effective income of middle class families and reducing the need for dangerous levels of debt. Progressivizing the payroll tax could increase middle-class take-home incomes by 5-7% and create a permanent economic incentive to create middle class jobs on the employer side. Expanding access to public health insurance by raising income limits on Medicaid and lowering the age limit on Medicare could save middle class families up to 3% of their income a year in premiums alone. Finally, reducing college tuition costs via a tuition support model outlined by Speaker Perez in California or by endowment support could save up to 9% income a year during the college years. Put together, this kind of income boost would put the middle class on secure footing, and place those working class families below the line on a path upwards.
I won't try to cover all the big-picture stuff about the legacy of Steve Jobs, because the entire commentariat is trying to do that right now.
Mr. Evans wrote from an address in Bloomsbury, “as connoisseur to connoisseur,” stating that business would bring him to Bradborough in the course of the following week. He wished to use the opportunity to see Mr. Digby’s pictures, of which he had often heard, and should Mr. Digby view his request favourably, would arrange his visit to suit his convenience.
Inevitably, Andy and I are bound to cross paths at the karate studio. Perhaps we have already and I had no clue, without any context. I'm not looking forward to it, to tell the truth. I have no idea what I'd say as we didn't split on friendly terms. I needed to document this story, though—coincidences are very intriguing to me. Is there a reason that our paths are crossing again after all this time?
In reality the paperwork began about two and a half weeks ago with course registration, which managed to make UW’s ridiculous system – waking up at 5:30 with 2000 other to click the “submit” button, a process that always includes at least one server crash – seem efficient. PUCV has evidently been slow to embrace the internet, so the day consisted mostly of copying course numbers and professor names onto various sheets of paper while tracking down department heads. This in turn led to yet more copying of course numbers and professor names.
They were SO NICE there. It was an older crowd, kind of like if your favorite uncle was gay, and this was where he went with all his friends. They welcomed us and took us under their wings, it was lovely. One guy (we found out he is the brother of the performer) translated all the songs they sang. The WHOLE bar sang songs and joked and laughed and we linked arms and sang with them. (Luckily one song's lyrics constisted of a bunch of "la la's" so that one we could do, the rest were in Dutch!) The performer's brother bought us a beer. The bartender checked up on us to make sure we had a good view of the show and were happy. It was, simply, amazing. I got teary eyed at one point, at how friendly these total strangers were to us. It truly was a wonderful example of how good and kind people can be. One guy (who had already complemented me on my "fabulous" glasses) kissed my cheeks three times, the Dutch way, when we were leaving and told me that he could tell I was a very nice woman, no really, a VERY NICE woman. I felt the love, I really did.)
Quinlan: Come on, read my future for me.
It's not really a rock and roll memoir. Instead, it's a coming of age story about a confused young woman who moves to New York at 20 years old after giving up a baby for adoption. She lives on the streets for a while until she meets the artist Robert Mapplethorpe. Together, they struggle with their work, themselves, and if not each other, then their relationship with each other, particularly Mapplethorpe, who was exploring his homosexuality at the same time he was in a relationship with Smith.

Article 2.4 of the Agreement recognizes the sovereignty of states over their natural resources and the access to their genetic resources pursuant to the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity of Rio de Janeiro. It also specifies that the parties cannot be prevented from adopting measures aimed at meeting the aims of Rio: (i) conservation of biological diversity, (ii) the sustainable use of its components and (iii) the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits from the use of genetic resources (Article 1 of the Rio de Janeiro Convention).

(49) To comfort those among the Christian faithful who were puzzled (to say the least) at their lot in life, the author of Revelation did for Christians just what the author of Daniel had done for Jews two centuries earlier. He wrote a book to demonstrate that because the mightiest of human agencies (the Roman Empire) was opposed to the one true faith (Christianity), God himself (in the person of Christ) must break into human history and bring it to an end.

Nikki took advantage of a weakened champion whose abilities were compromised by an accidental injury. Her victory didn’t come after a botched move or after thirty-five seconds of flailing around the ring. In fact she did something that WWE superstar Edge would’ve done: she took advantage of an opportunity.

Compounding and intensifying these issues of race and gender, they include concerns about the deep structures of inequality in our society—inequalities of wealth, privilege, and opportunity (including educational opportunity), and the attitudes of superiority those inequalities breed. And they include concerns that, whether they intend to or not, universities like Duke participate in this inequality and supply a home for a culture of privilege. The objection of our East Campus neighbors was a reaction to an attitude of arrogant inconsiderateness that reached its peak in the alleged event but that had long preceded it. I know that to many in our community, this student behavior has seemed to be the face of Duke.

Shoes: A well appointed Gentleman’s wardrobe will include a range of shoes for different occasions. Very formal occasions require black leather shoes, usually highly polished. In less formal contexts brown and black shoes or boots will be needed. For the adventurous and creative, or the very well appointed wardrobe, other colours such as navy or grey might feature in the shoe collection. Shoes ideally are smart, comfortable and clean. Shoes are the most commonly neglected element of a man’s wardrobe, and one of the more expensive. If you are one of the many men who possess no more than 2 pairs of shoes at a time, a pair of ‘smart’ and a pair of trainers, perhaps you need to begin your own 5-year project.
We were all pretty hungry and Leah really wanted to get some seafood while we were here since we were so close to the ocean. So we drove another 20 minutes to Mt. Pleasant to go to Red’s Ice House.
For the longest time, I never could quite understand what the fuss was all about (or see here). But then again, as W rightly pointed out, I had yet to eat a pukka example. Finally, some years back, on a trip to Sydney, we took an eternity of a train ride to Cabramatta the inconvenience of which was promptly forgotten and my enroute grumbling sheepishly taken back as we tucked into steamy, aromatic, gargantuan bowls of righteous phở piled high with perfectly cooked beefy tidbits and perky fresh herbs, and ordered to go a couple of wax paper wrapped baguette sandwiches to see us through the return journey.

She will accept combat instead, against the Thegn at the end of her road. He is a brute and a bandit, also a well-known rapist and a defiler of graves. He does not, however, attack people in mead-halls, so that is where women shelter from him while he adulterates graves. She agrees to pay the price of their wounds, if the players think to ask, so long as they are victorious.

The series starts when vampires decide to ” come out of the coffin” This is when vampires decide to start letting the humans know they are real and that they exist. The reason this happens is because the Japanese create synthetic blood so vampires no longer have to consume humans to live. There are many books in the series at this point. I believe we are up to 11 or 12. I am not sure of the exact number. I just know I have read every single one of them. In some cases, I have read them multiple times.

A million people have died so far as a result of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant accident, explains Janette Sherman, M.D., toxicologist and contributing editor of the book Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment. Published by the New York Academy of Sciences, the book, authored by Dr. Alexey Yablokov, Dr. Vassily Nesterenko and Dr. Alexey Nesterenko, examined medical records now available--which expose as a lie the claim of the International Atomic Energy Commission that perhaps 4,000 people may die as a result of Chernobyl.

There is none of the Lassallean, Utopian nonsense about the State being able to operate outside the market, prior to the establishment of Communism, in any of the works of Marx and Engels. In fact, in the Critique of the Gotha Programme and elsewhere Marx and Engels, argued specifically against such notions. Speaking not just of how things stand for workers now, or even under the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, but under the first stage of Communism, Marx writes,

I have been interested in Smart TV for a while now and I think it is an interesting area to look into. First of all, because it is TV and, despite what some people might think, TV still drives an enormous part of how we consume content. Secondly, the integration between telly and the Internet is likely to be a significant growth area for both consumer electronics firms and digital content providers.

For example, a publisher could cherry pick a selection of “loss leaders” to license for unlimited use in order to attract readers to the publisher’s other books. To avoid this conflict of interests, publishing contracts have for decades included an array of clauses intended to prevent a publisher from using cheap or free copies of one author’s books to promote another’s.

Missouri Republicans talk small government, but the truth is they are afraid to divorce the federal government in these matters because they are too afraid they will lose the big government money that comes with this dangerous relationship. If you are truly going to "reclaim America's future" it begins by enforcing the Constitution and limits placed upon government, otherwise we are heading over the cliff as government continues to overreach in all matters including education.

Like Bartholomew, Vanderlinden recommends many leafy vegetables and root crops. She also suggests trying some culinary herbs such as oregano and parsley. Both writers suggest peas and beans (bush variety) as good choices for shady gardens. (Bartholomew recommends at least six hours of sunlight for these vegetables.)
If an agent is fairly new but at an established house, they should still have a track record of sales since they are using the agency's reputation when approaching editors. Their stuff will get looked at and since they usually read in front of an established agent and have "training" so to speak; they have honed their eye and will know what will sell.

Jermaine is really good at manipulating me, and it doesn't take much for him to do so. Really, all I have to do is think about him or read a message from him and I feel myself starting to turn inside out in an attempt to 'make things okay'.

My demo started suspiciously like a scene in Yakuza 4. Akiyama the loan shark was sleeping on his couch with a magazine over his face. Then, a zombie burst in, all hell broke loose, and the gameplay started. The big change seasoned Yakuza vets will notice is that guns are a huge part of Dead Souls. Previous Yakuza games focused on hand-to-hand combat with some melee weapons, but Yakuza: Dead Souls gives each character a firearm with unlimited bullets as their main attack (although the fisticuffs and other weapons are still part of the game).
The bank of drawers and the sink are actually one cabinet. If it were stock, there wouldn't have been room for a cabinet of drawers, only one of those skinny cabinets to hold trays and cookie sheets.
But we always sense as they approach adolescence and young-adulthood that this bond, however violent and punishing, will not be able to hold and it is naturally our sensitive and bookish narrator who will become separated. The way in which his sexual awakening is used to finally break that tie is perhaps a little predictable and neat but there is no doubting the power of the final few chapters and the very real pain of this family. In the same way that we all recall just flashes of our own childhood's Torres' novel selects those enlightening moments, not like photographs as such because nothing about this book is static, but Kodak moments nonetheless, the paper now tinged and dirty, colours still vivid and yet somehow not true, and all of it passed by rather than past.

Some of them probably don’t deserve to be read by anyone else but I find I have a strange attachment to them, and now and again, when I have a bit of spare time, I go looking and find one of them. It feels like a guilty pleasure as I re-read them, enjoying the chance to meet the characters again, like old forgotten friends. I think about how I could change this or that, knowing that I will probably not find time or energy to re-write or edit them (and no doubt with some of them it is just as well!).

With its magical rock formations jutting up every which direction in the middle of a hundred miles of nothingness, the appeal of such a place could be seen as simply aesthetic. But the first time I entered the park gates, I achieved a level of serenity that I can only imagine equaled that of my father’s at Brazos Bend. I was at peace, feeling as if I had found the last holy place in America. And with this in mind, Melanie, Jimmy and I hiked to an impossibly difficult to reach cave, and set my father free.
RPM is a water-based pomade, and from my own experience washes out well. Despite it being a waterbased product, it does contain mineral oil which is disguised in the ingredients list as “parrafinum liquidum”. For those who are unaware of what mineral oil is: mineral oil is a cousin of petroleum jelly/petroletum etc. etc. Mineral oil and the like are avoided by those who are particularily effected by its comodegenic quality.
After hours of searching, Olivier said he saw his wife in a traumatised condition walking from the Boston Business College at “exactly 7.20 pm”. He immediately took her to the police station where she was medically examined. Semen was found on her body and dress. She also had visible injuries to her private parts. When Beeld saw her she had an enormous bump on her forehead.
"I hope you have noticed that you haven't received any letters about new bookselling packages. It's not because we ran out of stamps. We decided to make it or not, with the books and authors we have. We're still trying to find a way to sell books, when I come up with something I'll call."
On the other hand, I don’t want to leave you all with the impression that I’m not just as capable as the next guy of closing my eyes and pretending it’ll all “just go away” if I ignore it. So, to that end, I’ll conclude with a little more of the “distracting noise” this real-world “Army of Darkness” is counting on to mask what they’re up to:
First, is a company’s trademark. Your trademark is what identifies your brand to potential and current customers and encompasses your logo and your name. If one thinks of any major company, it is equally easy to visualize the name and its accompanying logo. Unfortunately, the very nature of the Internet makes the bar for trading on someone else’s name very cheap. For instance, if I wanted to take another’s company’s name/logo (which I’ll call Widget Corp.), I could right-click (and save) the logo from Widget Corp.’s website and then maybe buy a similar domain such as WidgetCorp.net or use a foreign domain extension or even if those were not available, maybe purchase Widget-Corp.com. Once I purchased a domain name, I could start selling goods similar to Widget Corp. on my website using the Internet traffic of customers who thought I was the real Widget Corp. This is a problem retailers face on the Internet all of the time and prevention is not easy (and is not confined to retailers). First, to prevent this problem, I always recommend purchasing domain names covering every foreign and domestic extension and each iteration of your trademark. Second, I always recommend monitoring your trademark by, at the very least, searching for it in every search engine regularly.

Roland of Gilead, the last true gunslinger, is fleeing with the boy Jake Chambers across a rope bridge suspended hundreds of feet above an underground gorge. They are being pursued by slow-mutants. These hideous creatures are the last remnants of mutated humans caused by the Great War, or some other final catastrophe. Author Stephen King never clearly reveals their origin. This scene is the climax of DT1. Roland is faced with a choice. He must choose to either save the boy, and lose his chance to complete his quest for the Tower….or let him fall, let Jake die, and continue his pursuit of the Man in Black.

This is a must read novel! A completely different take on vampires, Fukuda has created an intriguing, captivating, fast paced novel that readers won’t be able to put down. Going into the novel, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but like Fukuda’s previous novel, Crossing, it grabbed my attention from the get go, spurring me on until the very last page, when I screamed in agony over the cliffhanger that I’ll have to live with for the next year, until I can get my hands on the sequel of this compelling novel. Alas, it’s so worth it.

Well I am aware that something is going on. Even my mother was drawn to these trails. Taking pictures and telling me about them. Asking what I thought and if I knew anything. Slowly my family is coming to me, asking me what i think. How do I know what I know? Realizing that I am not crazy. That all along I was just trying to prepare them and myself. She showed me her pictures and I smirked. She wanted to know what was funny. Then I told her I had thousands of pictures similar to these. Also I Have read many books and watched a few documentary’s about the trails. Are they chem or com?
Did Youppi really unleash a curse? New findings are showing that bacteria on the wall of Houle’s brain might have been the cause of the curse. The bacteria would release spores into the air allowing it to be breathed. This in turn caused people who came into contact with Houle to become ill. Could this be what killed The Habs ? It appears this could have contributed to their demise, as well as the fact the team did not draft well.

Ask Me Why
In general, Oakeshott moves casually from Rationalism as a style of governing to Rationalism as propaganda and a form of political mobilization. This is a significant confusion. Although the ultimate disposition of who rules in a modern state may be in the hands of an ever broader array of people and classes, it is the politicians who rule, not the social classes. Within the political elite, the discontinuities do not seem strong enough to bear the explanatory burden that Oakeshott wishes to put on them. Long before the supposed end of absolute monarchies, ministers ruled as much or more than kings, and there was no hereditary requirement for those ministers. Today, voters choose their rulers from competing parties composed mainly of lawyer-politicians, many of whom come from political dynasties. The political "new man" is neither as recent nor as pervasive as Oakeshott makes out, so this will not do as the explanation for any decline of governing as a kind of traditional craft.
You see, I had laid my camera on our kitchen counter stools. When I went to grab it, it was laying between the stools almost on the floor. My oldest daughter had unintentionally knocked it off. Had she seen it there, she would have moved it, but she didn't even know it was on the stool or that it had fallen off. I have a bad habit of leaving my camera all over the place. A habit that was created because I have kids who never bother items that they know doesn't belong to them. Apparantly, I need to start being more careful where I leave it.

For when April collected the duvet she felt something small and bundled in a corner. Reaching in to pull out the expected stray sock, she removed instead frilly underwear.

For April did not own frilly black underwear with a fleur-de-lis pattern...

I’m hoping that Yamomoto won’t make any rash decisions. I’m sure that Sasakibe’s death affected him, so I hope that his decision won’t be too rash. But at least Soul Society is preparing for war. And seeing those captains return back to their positions…I guess that’s why there was that tear before, so that the ones rejected by Soul Society are back. I think that Soul Society should have given them an apology for their ‘exile’ but that’s behind the scenes. I just feel that they deserve some credit and all.

I began to feel that this was it. Who was going to be there for these precious women and babies? Wouldn't I want someone to care for me? If I don't go, who will? But...really? Me? The childbirth fearer? The one who stifled small gags at the mere thought of birth? YES. This was it. God was calling me to take a quantum leap of faith and trust Him with the rest.

After rereading this piece that I did, I realized that I’m actually sort of impressed by what my 17 year old self did. I was at a very dark time in my life. I realize that sounds so stereotypical teenager-y – but it’s true. The funny thing is though that when I look back, it was also one of the best times of my life too.

Wyatt absolutely loves playing with water. Now that the weather is too cold, and we had to put away his sand/water table for the winter, we had to find another way for Wyatt to play with water. He moves the chair over to the sink and signs and says water over and over. So I decided why not just let him play with it, it is just water and cleans up easily. Surprisingly he is very good with it, of course he does get some water on the floor but not nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

Not everything was a hit. N chose the chicken, portuguese sausage, and sweet potato gumbo. I think it's pretty good (we have leftovers and I can try again tomorrow), but it's not like any gumbo I've ever seen. It's not just the presence of sweet potato, which is a clever fusion idea, it's just that it wasn't a soup really and had no rice. I didn't taste it in detail yet, but I'm not sure if it was roux-based. I will have to investigate further. It was heavy on the cayenne.
is it to come or already passed?
Hope you have a wonderful day.

Texas technically had two breweries on the list last year, but one of them was Pete's. Although owned by San Antonio's Gambrinus company (which also owns Spoetzl), Pete's connection to Texas is only financial – the company was founded in California is now contract-brewed in New York.

What changed? When the work is challenging and I feel a sense of personal commitment to the business and the team, I think about work all the time. I’ll wake up in the middle of the night thinking about strategy and priorities and resource allocation. In China I would check my Blackberry just before I went to bed, and check it again when I woke up the next morning. On the other hand, when I’m not stimulated by the job it’s very easy for me to stay emotionally detached.
Overall Favorite Restaurant: Congratulations and kudos to Bergamot, an innovative and impressive restaurant in Somerville. Their food is superb, and the chef often combines what may seem to be disparate ingredients and creates delectable and harmonious dishes. From a phenomenal Pork Belly Ravioli, to an incredible Roast Chicken, the ever changing menu always has plenty of compelling dishes. They also have a killer wine list, with plenty of interesting choices, as well as an excellent cocktail program. Service is always professional and attentive, and the entire staff works well as a single unit. I have written a few times about Bergamot, including here, here and here. Every time I have dined here has been an excellent and delectable experience. It receives my highest recommendation and I urge all my readers to dine here.

Hailed as an “awe-inspiring work of history and storytelling,” “Fallen Giants” (Yale University Press, 2008) chronicles 250 years of the international quest to climb the world’s tallest peaks. “Isserman and Weaver,” wrote Bruce Barcott in the New York Times, “brilliantly present the complete picture — the political context, the changing social dynamics, the emergence of modern climbing technique — without losing sight of the need to entertain. ‘Fallen Giants’ absolutely brims with vivid characters, from the Duke of the Abruzzi to George Mallory … hard men and egotists, saints and scoundrels.”… – The Daily News Online, 12-11-10
Those supporters pouring on to the pitch quickly outnumbered Juventus’s players by many times that figure. Giorgio Chiellini was mobbed, the player’s face a mixture of delirium and faint concern as they launched him, shirtless, time and again into the night sky. In amongst the madness, a group of fans made off with a camera belonging to Italy’s Sky Sport. Others simp ly stood on the field and held their banners aloft. One bore a picture of the captain, Alessandro Del Piero, along with the simple message: “Thank you for existing”.
Pinter's characters usually give unreliable versions of their pasts from Stanely's account of the concert he gave at Lower Edmonton in The Birthday Party(1958) to Ruth's memories of her career as a photographic model in The Homecoming(1965). Whether they are fantasies or deliberate ploy to disconcert an opponent in a psychological game is never certain, but they are not believable recollections of the past.

He would die and never know the reason for his execution. It had not seemed stupid at the time, to leave his cell phone on his desk. If he had it, there might be time for security to save him. There was no way he could reach the fire alarm before being shot. This was it then; after examining his options there was nothing he could do. It was impossible to disappear into thin air.
To kick off the event, Steve and I developed an ordered list for the actual beer tasting, including which cheeses were recommended with each beer. Of course, we left the door open to experimentation with different combos, a few people being rather partial to the Black Diamond Aged Cheddar. I dare say this worked out even better than the first go-round, with plenty of crossover that yielded tasty results.
Scince i watched the video of the first single of this album "Go Do", i loved the voice of Jonsi (kind of reminds me of Mathew Bellamy from Muse in some moments). I didnt liked much the album except for "Go Do", "Boy Lilikoi", and "Tornado". Well, as far as the album goes, its too pop for my taste, but i do like to hear "Go Do" from time to time. I prefer Jonsi when he is on Sigur Ros (also another great band, ill post about them someday), not that hes bad on his own, but scince its his first solo release, maybe with time, ill found something else from him more of my taste.

And so here we are with a new mouse-trap. A small cage with a one-way funnel which lures the mice in but doesn't let them leave, like an early morning infomercial for knives which can cut through several layers of titanium and the hide of an 80-year-old Gold Coast socialite who has spent too long in the sun.
It’s as charming a felonious solicitation as you’re likely to hear. And given Holmes’ racist sense of entitlement, and the authorities’ refusal, for over 40 years, to prosecute such black racial extortion, she surely told herself that she was not committing a crime. Like when she committed tax evasion for years, without ever being prosecuted. Media protection and academic hagiographies notwithstanding, “civil rights leaders” have always routinely committed extortion, tax evasion, and sundry other crimes. Graft, sex, power: What else is there to the civil rights racket?
Sound familiar? It screams familiar.
The second issue is illustrated by Tom Neely with a cover by Langridge. Langridge described the cast: "Things are pretty much as you would expect if you know your Segar: Popeye loves Olive, Olive loves Popeye in her own fickle way, Popeye is a devoted stepfather to Swee'Pea, Wimpy's always looking for a free meal, etc. It ain't broke, so we ain't fixing it. Olive's brother Castor and their parents, Cole and Nana Oyl, are a part of the mix too. And you may spot Olive's first boyfriend, Ham Gravy, at some point, if you keep your eyes open. Other familiar faces will pop up as well. I've tried to get all of the regulars from the Segar years in there at some point, even if it's only a cameo."
Thankfully, God created angels with a purpose that does not know seasonal limitations. He created them to be His messengers to carry out His business in the world. They can be here one minute, warning us, embodying God's love for us, or filling a desperate need for us, even executing God's judgment against us (as in the book of Revelation), and then be gone then next. Although they may appear visibly or be heard audibly, they usually perform their duties as invisible, yet very real, agents of God. Most of the time angels are depicted in our modern culture as young women in wispy full-length gowns and delicate wings. Personally, I don't fully buy into that image, and from what I've read in Scripture, God doesn't want us to limit them to that view either. Sure, God can command an angel to minister to us in the form of a bystander giving words of comfort to someone going through a tough time. But when it comes to protecting us or defending us from the schemes of the devil, I'd much rather have God employ angels that are more characteristic of highly trained American soldiers than three chick friends standing in front of a bronze sculpture! I would not want to begin what kind of evil and terror we would go through if God's army of angels did not watch over each and every one of us!
The bigger reason probably has to do with my personality. If I worked in sales, my family would now be living in a homeless shelter. Some people are wired for that sort of evangelism, but most of us are not. When we have felt guilty enough to try it, it probably went something like this:
I know I am not unique in this feeling, yet, I hate thinking that I’m just being whiny about it. Instead of whining, I know I need to make a plan, outline said plan, and figure out how to execute this plan to live my life — my best life, instead of my crazy life. I know that to execute this plan, I need help, but I also know this help has to be of the “gently guided” sort. In my experience, when pushed, I push back. But, not in the most positive way possible. If I join a gym, don’t ask me each day if I’m planning on “making it to the gym today”. Every time I hear that, not only does something inside me break, it makes me want to take a fork and stab you in the eye. Not only do I not see you as trying to be helpful, I sense a feeling of passive aggressiveness. Maybe it is just me. Maybe it is my perception, based on my inability to see life through the eyes of a normal person, but every time I’m asked if I plan on “making it to the gym today”, I feel like a judgment is being passed on my decisions, as well as how I appear to you and everyone around me.

I have always hated my entry way cabinet, it has been around for over 10 years and has served many purposes. It has been beaten up pretty bad over the last few moves, and has been painted many different colors over it's life. The other down side to this table is there is not much space on the top, which would be nice. I would like to create a space for us to drop our keys or mail when we walk threw the door. It is time to retire the entry table and buy a new one, let the shopping begin.

I glance at my watch and realize that this show is not going to be over after an hour as I’d hoped. Just before the interval, the Chatterbox whispers to me, ‘Is it almost over?’ Coincidentally, the lights go up. I have to explain patiently that we are only halfway through.
Similar to the raising of cattle, farming fish creates a problematic redistribution of protein in the food system. Removing such immense amounts of small prey fish from an ecosystem can significantly upset its balance. According to Rosamond L. Naylor, an agricultural economist at Stanford’s Center for Environmental Science and Policy, “We are not taking strain off wild fisheries. We are adding to it. This cannot be sustained forever.”

The Preamble of the Constitution is considered part and parcel of the Constitution
We have been warned that in the last days the hearts will grow cold, the people will tell tales and seek truth from false prophets who tickle their itching ears. We have been told what till happen, the signs to look for, and the season it will happen, but we have been taught by man to no longer trust that information, and to seek our own path. Step outside of your beliefs and just look at the world, then look at what we were told would happen. Look at the alignment of kingdoms and principalities. Look at the wickedness in high places. It is all there for us to plainly see and yet we deny it for then we would have to consider the source of that information.
I figure, when they get in office they better know why a situation is or isn’t the way it is. It is not realistic in my opinion to expect our electorate to be able to do all in the manner, direction or speed they boasted. Hold them accountable yes, but with some reason mixed in.

Apart from those who are here in Hawai`i, one of my many favorite wedding photographers is Jessica Claire, who is based out of Southern California.

I have been enjoying her photographs and her blog for a little while now, and she just never ceases to amaze me every time!

I suppose the thing is now made manifest to you my brethren: this great and most concerning secret and mystery (sacramentum). What is the force of charity, all Scripture doth set forth; but I know not whether any where it be more largely set forth than in this Epistle. We pray you and beseech you in the Lord, that both what ye have heard ye will keep in memory, and to that which is yet to be said, until the epistle be finished, will come with earnestness, and with earnestness hear the same. But open ye your heart for the good seed: root out the thorns, that that which we are sowing in you be not choked, but rather that the harvest may grow, and that the Husbandman may rejoice and make ready the barn for you as for grain, not the fire as for the chaff.

Women in the legal profession is the final topic of the collection. Cynthia Grant Bowman exposes Blank v Sullivan & Cromwell (1975), a case which is not so well known as it was settled, telling of the activism of law students in the litigation that forced Wall Street law firms to hire women. She uses it as a reminder of the early obstacles that faced women who tried to enter and did enter the legal profession, and to exemplify the role that attitudes rather than rules or ‘official’ practices play in excluding women in the legal profession today. Lastly, Stacy Leeds writes of Unknown Woman, unreported case, an ‘everyday’ case involving domestic violence which illustrates the tensions that confront women in the legal profession, the impact of law on the everyday lives of women, and the chapter brings together many of the themes of the book.

It comes free with the Collector’s Edition but costs $10 if you own the standard edition and it’s Day 1 DLC.

Each month, I auction items being held in our vault. These items come to the Treasury from abandoned safe deposit boxes from all the banks across the State of Wisconsin. We receive these items after 5 years of inactivity and hold onto them for at least 3 more years. After trying to locate owners, the items are sol; most of the items are coins, jewelry or stamps. The money made is returned to the unclaimed property account in the owner’s name waiting for it to be claimed. The money remains in that person’s name forever and is never placed into the state’s general funds.

II. THE NEW PROPAGANDA
Although Blazers executives would not say this is the end of the Oden era, the chances Oden plays again in Portland, or anywhere in the NBA, are doubtful at best. Of his five knee surgeries, three of them have been microfracture procedures, including Monday's surgery in Vail, Colo. Microfracture is the most invasive and serious of knee procedures, and involves making tiny fractures in the knee bone to generate bleeding and stimulate new cartilage growth. No NBA player has come back to play after undergoing three microfracture surgeries.

These were so fun to make and seriously really yummy! I think the sweetness of the corn muffin mix is what made them so good! We are planning on doing a lot of cooking on the griddle when we are camping in the Airstream, and these will be added to the camping dinner schedule for sure:)
I’ve also been diving head-first into MYTH, developing the other characters further. I’ve figured out that either I’m going to write the next lord of the rings, or I’m never going to write the fucking thing. One of the two… I’m personally pulling for the first choice.
For the religious right, it may seem like the lesser of two evils to back a Mormon over a liberal, mainstream Christian (Obama’s mother attended Baptist and Methodist churches and he was a member of United Church of Christ). The continued efforts of Ron Paul, however, make this a three-choice scenario.

Incidentally, I visited with the Chief Medicolegal Death Investigator this past Monday regarding his opinion on the state of the OME. We enjoyed a 30 minute conversation until work got in the way. (By the way, he is a retired homicide detective.) He told me a story about SWAT and their response to burn-out. He commented that we sometimes overestimate the amount of stress we can handle. He suggested that sometimes it requires administrators to appreciate the amount of stress that is tolerable and learn when to pull an employee out of a situation before that limit is reached. We brainstormed a few strategies to solve the issue or at least help mitigate exhaustion in employees while performing autopsies.

Even though he had no European connections, Jack Cole, a Methodist from Pennsylvania, was among the many American cartoonists who created anti-Hitler comics months before the attack on Pearl Harbor in December, 1941.

Did you know that there is an actual word (in the dictionary and everything) that is used to describe the noise your stomach makes when your hungry? Nope, neither did I...but there is and it's an onomatopoeia (a word that imitates or suggests the source of the sound that it describes) which in this case is Borborygmi. (If you say it out loud it does kind of sound like your stomach rumbling).

Finally, I just want to mention that I was actually surprised by a particular reveal at the end of this novel concerning one of the characters - and that was just fine with me too. I like being surprised thanks to good writing, and this one made me want to go back through the novel to see whether I could spot any hints towards the character being more than what he seemed.

Creme had, though. A few times it was stolen – she did not consider Stormwind’s guards to be above being targeted for theft. Other times it was a kind ‘gift’ to the orphanage from some ‘generous’ donor, given to the children when times were tough. She certainly hoped that the ‘kind donors’ weren’t actually the folks at the Abbey and were instead from some rich fatcat who just wanted to look kind for giving food to adorable children on a budget (And there were plenty of those bu tthat was a story for another day).

Here we go with the only landscaped card of the Nats Team Set Right Fielder and Slugger Jayson Werth (I keep wanting to put an "A" in his last name). When Jayson was with the Phillies he was a big pain in the rear to the Nats, however since being with the Nats he really hasn't been that big a pain to other teams. It seems his best career years so far have been the ones with the Phillies. When we first got him I was really excited about his running/scoring ability and his decent fielding. He has been more of a let down, but he can still come through every once in a while. I just wish it happened more often. In the pic on his card it looks like he is trying to avoid a tag, but I don't see where the ball is. Maybe this was a scoring play? Or was it a "Hotbox" out?

So much for the past. The commentary has been greatly extended for the present edition, and the appendices cut back accordingly. More importantly, the editors seem to have been asking themselves some fundamental questions about what Terrell is really for. The winds of change have made their presence felt, and just as Great Britain has found itself bereft of the Empire which Sir Courtney Terrell served as a judge, so the editors of Terrell must have had cause to wonder about their own future role and relevance. In its own dignified fashion, Terrell has been adjusting itself to the new ways since the 13th edition of 1982, but the need to adapt to a new environment has intensified, as the Preface candidly acknowledges:
Finally, at 4 PM on Friday, still not knowing if I should pack my running gear, I got the phone call from my doctor. He wanted to refer me to an orthopedic doctor to look at my legs. I asked him point blank if that meant that I couldn’t run on Sunday and there was a long pause. He asked me if I was in pain right then and there and of course I wasn’t. He then thought a little bit, asked me more questions about the pain. He said that if it was a bone fracture, it would hurt like hell. Then I asked about the “abnormal activity” on my leg in the scan and he said that inflamed tendons can show up on these scans as well. He got back to the race ahead and finally concluded that I should run…absolutely I should run this thing. His words of advice: ”If it starts to hurt, stop running.” Greater words have never been spoken to a runner.
If you're not a baker, or if you're young and new to home cooking, I hope you'll try making bread. It will save you money and it's better for you because there is no preservative in home baked bread.

We seize control of the government and do the following: Cancel all government debts using the seized assets of bankers and the traitors who assisted them plus the money held by government agencies listed at www.CAFR1.com. Debt cancellation will cut 500 billion dollars a year in federal interest payments and help balance local budgets. Take 3 trillion dollars of those seized assets and use them to cancel $20,000 in debts for every adult citizen who is not in prison. Take another 3 trillion dollars and use it to pay the taxes of the first $100,000 of income for a family of four. Release the advanced technologies the Secret Government has been working with since they inherited Nicola Tesla’s labs and notes in January of 1943. We will also need to seize the Federal Reserve and end fractional reserve banking. By issuing a non-interest bearing currency, we will be able to spend 500 billion dollars a year into circulation. This money plus the revenue on tariff designed to protect all those new industries created by the release of sequestered technology will help pay off pensions. The Tesla technology should cut utility bills by 2/3rds. We can issue stock in the new technology corporations and give that to people under 40 to fund their Social Security which will be held for them in co-operative trusts never to be touched by either politicians or anyone from Wall Street.
In-app purchases are basically the downloadable content (DLC) of the mobile world, and they’re a polarizing subject to be sure. Essentially operating on a “freemium” model, most games with in-app purchases are free, but require small payments to add new levels or get otherwise unobtainable items. Many games allow you to advance at an accelerated pace with purchases, such as exchanging small amounts of real money for in-game currency. Some of the most popular games on Android, iOS and Facebook operate in this manner and are extremely profitable. A good example from Gameloft’s stable is The Oregon Trail: Settler, now #36 in the list of the most popular free games on the Google Play Store.

How else will the agent know what you hope to accomplish? In a few cases, an agent you are introduced to through a trusted contact may sit down with you to hear about your project — and if they’re intrigued they’ll ask you to produce a proposal. If they want the project, they’ll work with you on it. They are not paid for this time, nor are you. It’s a lot of work! Do it cheerfully and diligently. Even if that book does not sell (and that happens), you’re learning how to write this crucial document and will do it better next time.

I spoke to my life coach about it all as he knew my son a bit too. He suggested I encourage my son to think in a “win/win” way, not “win/lose” as he was inclined to. He also pointed out computers teach a lot and many adults still viewed them negatively thinking the children only use them for gaming. He also recommended tai chi over karate as he felt it taught more discipline, but suggested I not restrict the computer today as there was already more than enough to contend with and I might overwhelm my son with it all.

The extent of Commonwealth power over matters concerning the internet, including journalism that is published online, is yet to be considered by the High Court. However, it is likely that the internet falls within the scope of section 51(v) either as a ‘telephonic’ or ‘other like service’, and that federal regulation could validly extend to the means of online communication, such as infrastructure (eg, the installation of fibre optic cables) and the conduct of internet service providers (ISPs). Other heads of power, such as those mentioned above, may also support Commonwealth regulation of online content. The potential for this is explored further below.

I do think NBC did many strange scheduling things this year. I never understood relegating Grimm to Friday once all their fall offerings had flopped before it premiered. Their Wednesday scheduling all year has been somewhat perplexing. But the one thing that I really didn’t understand was not using The Voice results show to either launch Awake or at the very least not deprive Parenthood a full season and strong lead in. This is one of their best performers at 10 and easily their most critically acclaimed drama. Cutting the order made no sense to me, but it would have really benefited NBC to at least let the final 4 eps air behind a Voice results show instead of Fashion Star which is completely squandering that lead in.
Readers of Candace Calvert’s books were first introduced to Riley Hale in Code Triage, which was set at Golden Gate Mercy Hospital in San Francisco. Riley has now moved back to her home state of Texas and is desperate to regain the full set of skills needed to be an ER nurse. She doesn’t just need to prove herself to her employers and her family; she’s desperate to prove to herself that she can do everything she was able to do before the attack. Her associates love the work she does as a chaplain, but Riley doesn’t see that role in her future. She and Jack see each other as a means to an end: she can get the practice she needs at his free clinic and he thinks he can use her family name to keep his clinic open and possibly obtain funding for it.
The old photo makes your heart sink even deeper. San Sebastian Church looms in the background, as one strolls along a street passing more old houses, many in decay. We went up one “bahay na bato” which has been leased out, and subleased out, to many families occupying small rented spaces. The Rent Control Law in the country bars property owners to increase rental rates at a certain range, and this allowed these families to keep leasing these spaces at ridiculously low rates. Gentrification truly makes a huge issue here! But such is life. It takes political will to want to restore this once elegant street and district and give new meaning to urban renewal. Preserving our heritage does not necessarily mean being anti-poor. My fingers and toes are crossed that somehow, someday, we can all agree that national pride resides in these heritage treasures.

My mode of transportation in Kolkata, India was an auto rickshaw. It is a motorized, 3 wheeler scooter which was built to accommodate 3 to 4 people but in reality, it carried 6. I hailed one with a flick of my hand, jumped in, glared at my fellow passenger if he was trying to get closer than necessary and promptly immersed in my own thoughts, whatever was important at that time – classes, exams, job interviews, crushes. Never noticed the weaving of the auto, never paid attention to the distance of my auto, or the lack of it, from the vehicle in front.

The men would push the furniture to the walls and sweep the floors, while the women cooked a big gumbo and also some sweet dough pies. Since there were not any dance clubs within driving distance, these rural Cajuns would gather weekly and dance at their neighbor’s homes – until eventually it was their own turn to host one at home. At these house dances there were always dance contests – one for the best two-step, and one the best waltz.

Not every child that is exposed to a potentially trauma-inducing situation will be traumatized. In fact, two children can be exposed to the same traumatic event, resulting with one child being traumatized while the other is not. A potentially trauma-inducing situation is only traumatic if the child’s experience is one of terror, feeling totally unsafe and powerless to do anything about the situation they found themselves in (freeze). Furthermore, two children exposed to the same potentially trauma-inducing event may both be traumatized, yet their traumatic experience of the event is different. It all depends on how the child experienced that traumatic exposure from a sensory perspective. Again, it is not the event that is the trauma, but it is the experience of that event.

"On my birthday, the 16th of March, I woke up to a truly glorious day! Bright sunshine, and record breaking warm temperatures! How could I not be cheerful? I danced around the house with the sunlight streaming through the windows, and even when I woke my sister and we had a bit of a disagreement, it passed quickly and the day continued in it's joyous flow..."

And both these paintings have been reworked, by different artists at different times. The Cambridge painting was so badly damaged that the restorer had to guess at the eye-colour. Can they still be said to be of the same man? They have the same facial proportions, the same hair-line, same brow-line, same nose.

It started out a bit uneventful with a massively steep climb. I was leap frogging with this pair of inexperienced hikers from just south of Barcelona, name Raul and Silma. They spoke no English so our communication was limited to the occasional nod. As soon as I got the the top of the first steep incline, the hike showered me with amazing landscapes.

Who doesn't love a good gift idea? I know I do! Sometimes I put a ton of pressure on myself to try and give the perfect gift. I hate the feeling of giving someone something that I am pretty sure they are not really that enthused about! I also hate to give gift cards...I think the main reason for this is that I struggle when I am given a gift card. I still have a few gift cards that I was given for Christmas that I haven't even touched! It is like the curse of the gift card, the minute you get a gift card to a particular store is the moment you dislike everything in that store! I have a really hard time spending gift cards on myself...unless, of course, it is a starbucks gift card! I have always been a big fan of gift baskets....whether it is a baby shower, wedding shower, bachelorette party, house warming or birthday, a gift basket always seems like a good idea!
Although Bloops are some of the loudest sounds of any type ever recorded in Earth’s oceans, their origin remains unknown. The Bloop sound was placed as occurring several times off the southern coast of South America and was audible 5,000 kilometers away.
Now that the mess has passed and forced on us, Ben is bailing. How much was that vote worth? Is there any reason to believe power-hungry political animals? Limited government? Where? I am continuing my call for removal of agencies, first being the HHS, followed by Depts of energy, housing, education, and any others that they can throw in for good measure. These are the engines of personal and national destruction, and in this case – death. As for the voters who keep putting these vultures back in seats – STOP IT. Turnover is good.

“Let us assume, therefore, you were having a secret meeting with your slaves (sub Rosa = secret) before I arrived and from then on proceeded to lie to me at various intervals. I wouldn’t call you a stupid man Marcus, so you must have been planning something and lying deliberately. You said to me, if I can’t trust you, who can I trust? The answer was no-one and the conclusion? A hoax.” I took a breather, exhausted.
The festive season seemed to sweep me away, and I spent my days watching Christmas television, eating lots of chocolate and satsumas, generally lazying around. Then January arrived and I realised I had lots of uni work to do, so there went my days. And then suddenly all the days seemed to come and go, and before I knew it we're nearly at the end of February.
Anyway! SOMEHOW you’ve managed to breach blog security here, Varian, so I suppose I should answer you. First of all, on the poetry in general, hey, don’t get pissy with me because I’ve read a book in my life. Don’t you have some giant library right there in your castle? How about you reach up on one of those shelves and crack a tome once in a while and maybe get some damn culture.
The sole premise for this is that if the difference between rich and poor is large, those less well off are exposed to stress and inferiority which damages them in a plethora of ways. Far from being happy with rising global prosperity, the fact that others have more than them is enough to poison their existence.

This compilation tells the story of Stax's move into the gospel field by choosing the best of the output. From the Staple Singers' glorious template via the inspired and unique voice of Rance Allen, the mainstay of the Gospel Truth label itself. We have cuts from the sought-after and super-rare Sons Of Truth LP, and Joshie Joe Armstead's You Got The Vibes, a UK northern soul monster almost from the day it was released.
The world's great cities pose a problem to the traveller who visits them. What makes them the world's great cities is their inexhaustable nature: there's always something new to try, or something old that you've just never got round to experiencing yet. And it's very easy to find favourite haunts, be they museums, markets, restaurants or pubs, whole favourite neighbourhoods even. For the traveller, indulging in such familiar comforts comes at a huge opportunity cost: the experiences that you've not yet had, the markets not yet browsed, the pubs not yet troubled for a pint and a pickled egg.
They say this will create jobs because it will give people trust in the future of the economy, but how does firing people and taking money away from those who will spend it create jobs???!!!
Once again, forgiveness is not directly about you and your feelings. It is about restoring the relationship and doing so, not by ignoring the sin or excusing it, but by open and honest rebuke and open and honest repentance on their part. Forgiveness is to release from hard feelings, yes, but it is also to release from revenge and to help them overcome their sins!
Meryl is obviously a diva big time. Hardly anyone else gets any screen time; Richard E Grant plays Heseltine: blink and you will miss him. It's all about Meryl. The only other actor given any screen time is Jim Broadbent doing his genial old buffer routine - he has done it as Mr Iris Murdoch, Mr Mary Whitehouse and God knows who else. It's wearing a bit thin. Meryl of course is always Meryl - there is no suspension of disbelief, you never believe for a second that this is Thatcher, always that this is Meryl acting Thatcher (isn't she good? no, not if she can't disappear behind her character, not if you never for a single moment forget that this is Meryl being Thatcher). For me Lindsay Duncan as Thatcher was excellent; miles and miles better than this crap (and Lindsay Duncan's was not an entirely unsympathetic portrait, a more complex one perhaps). The other thing about the Streep movie is the screenplay. God it's awful.

Not any more. As a teenager I would read paranormal/horror/magic books, films etc to the point where I couldn't go pee, look in a mirror or out the window for fear of seeing a pair of red eyes staring back. God help me if I was still awake at 3:15am. I would switch the light off and run over to the bed with my eyes closed (hoping the ghosts wouldn't be inside my eyelids). Grew out of it in my early 20's.

The color of this polish is not fully accurate on my pictures, sorry. In real life, it looks a little more pink and not that salmon. The formula of this polish was not great. I had some trouble applying it because it was a bit thick and it takes a long time to dry. So it's not the best pink creme you can find on the market...

"Do you want to talk about fake toast stories or do you want to hear this story?"I've done similar to both of these, and the conversations always ended abruptly. Charity does not mean letting someone kick you in the teeth, and turning the other cheek doesn't mean being a doormat. Faith is not entertainment. It's the ideal upon which we base our entire existence. Look to Christ in the gospels as our model in this. How often during his 3-year ministry up until his arrest did Jesus allow Himself to become the butt of a joke?

I also showed the student editors some national tools that provide census data down to the local level. American Factfinder is my favorite of these; it will give you 2010 census data at the state, county, town, and even neighborhood level. One interesting piece of comparative data is the number of people using public transportation to get to work: In Carrboro, in 2010, 1,750 indicated they did so, or 16.3% of the population; in Durham, in 2010, 3,892 did so, or 3.1% of the population.

The Movie wasn’t as successful as it was intended to be but like they say, different stroke for different folks. But to be fair, the movie did have as much going for it compared to a movie like any of the “Naked Gun” movies, the only thing that “Naked Gun” had that more was an awesome actor like Leslie Nelson, R.I.P., this movie has very forgettable characters other than the black guy who dresses like Hitler, and like a tomato. The movie got so popular in the underground, that it spawned 3 sequels, 3 video games, and Saturday Morning cartoon show on fox.
I am not quite sure what else the Pole is supposed to say. Arguing that the squad needs to be improved further before any title challenge can be made is not going to endear himself to manager or team-mate alike. I am not going to indulge in fantasy football manager here, my views have not changed over the years: every single squad needs changes each summer, every squad can be improved. To believe otherwise is delusional and ignores the realities of football.
My first half-marathon is on May 20th and I’m scared to death, anxious, worried, bummed, and everything else I can’t think of right now. Why?

He must have had Stone or Dogfish head on tap in his apartment.

Susan Wilkinson was born in India where her Irish father was a doctor and her grandfather an engineer with the Indian railways. (He was knighted by George VI for his work.) Her father's brother was also a doctor and was personal physician to Jinnah, founder and first Governor General of Pakistan. When she was a child Susan's family left India after Indian independence and went to Ireland where she attended school in Dublin (Alexandra College). It was a very classical education. She learned no science, botany or biology as they were not compulsory subjects, but received a thorough grounding in Latin, Irish and Literature and History as well as Greek myths.

I do remember that November night. To kill myself was a whim. I had felt a strange inner numbness for some time before and mistook it for an altered spiritual state. My body didn’t matter much, I had to get rid of it.
We’d made plans with everyone else to meet up at Jonathan’s hotel at 10am, but woke up quite a bit earlier, so we were able to have a leisurely breakfast and spend some time exploring the area around our hotel. I mentioned before that we ate croissants every day for breakfast while we were in Europe; we assumed when we left Paris that that would be it for our daily morning pastries, thinking that the Dutch breakfast offerings would be more on the savory end, but when we walked up to the breakfast buffet the first morning, the first thing on the line was a basket filled with golden croissants.
What do you desire? Most of my life my answer to this question would be to be a great student, a good friend, a loving daughter, an excellent wife, and a gracious mom. While I still desire all of those things, God has given me a deep desire to encourage others. The older I get the more I learn about my relationship with Christ and the abundant joy that comes from being a daughter of the King. With that, comes the passion to share that joy with others.

Ultimately this rally is not just about politics. The Bersih 3.0 rally is about Malaysia’s future – about whether a national leader will lead, about whether the field will be fair enough to be respectable, about whether a government treats its people with a modicum of respect and about whether politics in Malaysia will be a politics of the street or effective dialogue with a reasonable leadership.

Thinking is just as much part of creating a novel as actually setting the words down. Don’t feel pressured to start too early, and don’t feel guilty if you’re not hammering out those two thousand words a day. (Me? I sometimes don’t write more than fifty. Or I end up with fewer words at the end of the day, because I’ve been cutting and unpicking.) Often, if you get stuck, it’s a sign that you’re veering off course with the book – maybe trying to force a character to do something they wouldn’t. Give yourself time out. Go off and do something different and let your subconscious mind come up with the answers.

The Constitution of the United States had as its primary goal the protection of the people from the power of an existing government. The Founding Fathers intended to keep any single governing body from abusing the people by creating a separation of powers and keeping these separated powers in a state of perpetual and permanent antagonism. Church and state are kept separate with the intent of keeping either of them or the combination of them from oppressing the common people. The power of the state is fragmented into executive, legislative and judiciary to prevent any of them from abusing the people. The direct exercise of executive power is fragmented into federal, state, county, city each of which is intended to maintain its own portion of power by a jealous conflict with each of the other powers. The whole point of this separation of powers is to protect the people as groups and individuals by providing them with several opportunities for redress from grievance created by any one of those individual governmental powers. Even the military was broken up into various branches so that no single unit could by some swift action gain control and abuse the people.
So obviously the Russian River Salvation is a brown ale, because the combined product is much darker. As is usual for my taste in Belgians, I preferred the golden straight up, but nonetheless, the mixed Collaboration was still might tasty, especially after I let it warm up a bit. Both are highly recommended, and if I ever get out to California again, I'll definitely sample the Russian River.
To look back and review the past could either be helpful or destructive, depending on how we let things affect us.
The Police once again showed that they are not upholding the law but actively intervening to warn the owners of halls that the left hire that there may be trouble. In other words they are consciously using the threats from fascist groups to attack free speech for the Left and thus effectively doing the work of the fascists for them. Of course, if official propaganda is to be believed, the purpose of the Police is to ensure that such threats are faced down and dealt with. But not when it comes to fascist threats.

Arriving in Paris at something like 4 a.m. Eastern Time, 9 a.m local, we hustled down the concourse and on to our next gate. I was bleary and my brain wasn't registering what was said to me in English, let alone polite French, but eventually I gathered I needed to also shed my jacket (not just my shoes) and got my carry-on bag rummaged through again. We had coffee and muffins and eventually we shuttled out to our plane, where we boarded and waited for a couple of hours. No particular reason was given, so we all just hung out and eventually they said sit down we're leaving. It was a full flight this time and we were seated next to a man heading to work on the oil rigs.

At the same time, I hope the police will also act against their own personnel who acted contrary to their duties as protectors of public security and custodians of the law.

Makes scenery important. There are factions that can ignore almost all the terrain on the board with the proper list (Legion, Circle). They make caster kill games an unfair proposition. One player has to deal with the forest and the walls while the other one ignores them all and focuses on grinding the opponent getting ready for caster kill. Trust me, I’ve played a ton of those and it is not fun at all. Sure, on a scenario things are the same for both players (one ignoring everything) but that player has to be active about stuff, and not just reactive from safety. You can hide all you want, but when I score that 3rd point I win no matter what you have done and how with your spiffy rules.

At the end of it all, many miles were run by many teams. Some of which ended two of the three days with well over 100 laps each. It all serves them well in their quest to learn more about the behaviour of their cars. It means more time with the Pirelli tyres and learning about their optimum operating temperatures and wear patterns. It means the ability to see the effect of their upgrades before they are brought to a circuit on a GP weekend. This can make the biggest difference to a team looking to get into the championship race or staying in it. What the participating teams learned in these three days will make a hug difference from this point in time going forward. A simple change of a few degrees in any direction can make the difference between standing on the podium, taking a champagne shower or heading to the hotel to shower before taking an early flight out.

Unruly Child have reformed and will be releasing their comeback album via Frontiers next year. The line-up will be Marcie Free, Bruce Gowdy, Guy Allison, with Larry Antonino and Jay Schellen. Marcie Free was Mark Free at the time of the band’s last album but she underwent a sex change and still has the voice! Check out the albums from Signal and King Kobra that feature Free’s awesome vocal talents.

I never fancied myself a “woman obsessed with marriage” especially on grounds that I was biologically female and therefore predisposed to such an attitude. Which is an inaccurate bastardization of sociobiological and Darwinian theory anyway; especially considering the statistically more “promiscuous,” unhitched, sexual and reproductive habits of females outside of the northern hemisphere i.e. it has been observed that in hotter, wetter, equator climates, the biological advantage and imperative does not privilege monogamy or marriage but instead matriarchal and often single-mother or coven-raised children of as much varied genetic source material and biodiversity within a family as possible i.e. more partners and children by different ones = more genetic variation, different immunities, and better chance for survival of at least some offspring of large broods in harsher environments.

Do you see the gorgeous (IMO) photo above? I took it a year or two ago using a reverse macro lens. Otherwise known as the “poor man’s macro,” a reverse macro is when you take the lens off your SLR camera, flip it around (so the part that is typically attached to the camera is pointed at the subject) and you either hold it there, steady with your hand, or you attach it via some other method. This allows you to get very close to your subject get an interesting photo, and not pay for a macro lens.

At the risk of sounding unbearably smug I have been predicting such an event. To be honest, though, I didn't expect the sudden crunch happening now. Moreover I wasn't basing my prediction upon "gut feeling" but upon data.

With this in mind, however, you must see that these things that supposedly add to our own personal value, we create and nurture a stigma to our very identity? We become a farce of a people, defined by starstruck glamour and glory, the kind of which burns out as it passes through the atmosphere of time. We are proud, sure. We are happy, sure. Call me a cynic or pessimist, because then I must ask: How long will that pride, the happiness, last? We cannot allow ourselves to be defined by such standards. It perplexes me as to how one can continue to find motivation from something so fleeting.

Emma Berkey and Dave Cuomo have a wood fired oven roaring away in the space that used to house Swett's. Those pizzas come out lightning fast (about four minutes). The crust has just a nice little char on the backside and a great chewy/crispy texture. The tomato sauce for the pizza is exceptional and the Veggie Eater says "sprightly". Housemade mozzarella made the Margherita our personal favorite. You must also try the hummus pizza with zatar, toasted nuts, mint and chili oil...zippy, different and delicious. And did we tell you they bake their own sourdough bread for sale (sour and great flavor)! Heck, we're loving this place.
I was able to do much more than I ever imagined by just cutting out some of the fluff, but it didn’t stop there. I then began to feel the urge to further question myself. If God came here and asked me what one possession I really enjoyed, what would it be? TV, naw I don’t really care too much about that, I could part with the computer too, cell-phone, no problem, hmm, Hey I really like my quad, yes, that would be it. God, I would have to say, I really enjoy my quad, and I want to thank you for blessing me with it. I am able on my days off to get on it and head out into the mountains by my house exploring, taking pictures, having a great time in nature. Yeah, I was really fond of my quad.

Amit Bansal answers, Basic telephone etiquette include finding a quiet place to speak and ensuring your phone volume is loud enough for both parties to hear properly. Do not chew while you speak and it’s a good idea to smile while talking as that will reflect confidence in your voice. You must keep your resume in front of you while talking with the interviewer. Try to sit at one place and speak rather than walking and talking.
The best way to imagine the scene is to picture a stall covered in bunting, manned by shell-shocked chocolate makers. In front of them is a jostling, heaving wall of people, all seemingly absolutely desperate for a taste of dark chocolate and chilli. Occasionally the stall holder will gingerly hold out a free sample, akin to feeding ravenous penguins. I had this vision of me leaping out from the back, catching a piece of chocolate in a single bite, and then vanishing into the crowd with a self-satisfied ‘arf’.
So my big training run was the New Years Double. Conservative pace, back-to-back half marathon with full marathon. Perfect 50-miler training - which involves a lot of back-to-back long runs. The week after that I used for "recovery"... which in Lesley-world is a little different... but we pulled the miles significantly back from my 71 mile week to a 43 mile week - which ended with an 8-14 as my back-to-back long runs. I have been feeling exceptionally good and this week had been planned as another peak mileage week with long runs of 14-22. Buuuuuuuut, I felt so great on New Years, that I was really craving the mental boost that a super long run would give me... more so than back-to-backs.

But is that fair? Why did God not just reveal himself to Amalek as he did Israel so they could have a chance at repentance? He actually did just that.

The Davison era is described, usually by its detractors, as a soap opera. “Soap opera,” it should be noted, is one of the great denigrating terms in science fiction fandom. There is nothing, including the Star Wars Christmas Special, quite as bad in the world as being a soap opera.

The Boko Haram as presently constituted has three wings. The pro-sharia Boko Haram which is the offshoot of the one led by late Alhaji Yusuf, the All Queda Boko Haram which is sponsored by Arab support and the Peoples Democratic Party Boko Haram which wants to prevent President Goodluck from contesting for a second term in 2015 or stifle his seven year tenure elongation bid. My analysis is to dissect the PDP Boko Haram and the lies they have fed Nigerians.

A little known fact is that Haig was the original choice to captain England on their tour of Australia in 1932-33, and had assembled a team to put his plan into operation, including Bert Block of Yorkshire (famous for his quip “We’ll get ‘em in no balls“) and Albert Bore of Warwickshire (later to become the leader of Birmingham City Council).
Given the lack of apparent grand, alternative narratives to neoliberalism, we are forced to look for the budding, small scale alternatives that are growing around us. Bolivia, where resistance to the social suffering caused by the neoliberal revolution began in the 1990s, can provide a few useful lessons and visions of what the future might hold for us. For, in the process of implementing popular responses to neoliberalism’s worst excesses, Bolivia and other Latin American countries have had a head start that is decades long.
How things will shape in the future remains to be seen. But things must change if publishers are to warrant their own existence. The path of fast-tracking a book to publication using an author solutions service and selling directly to the reading client is becoming a greater and often more lucrative option.

Another aspect of this theory is where does inbreeding fit in? If sperm competition genetically upgrades the sperm of all sperm cocktail donors, and if an activated SSF routinely selects the genetically superior sperm from a variable sperm cocktail, would sexual relations with close relatives (inbreeding) pose the same risks of manifesting recessive or deleterious traits in offspring as the inbreeding found in monogamous or polygynous or polyandrous settings?

Maybe I’m just old fashioned. Maybe I’m just an old dinosaur attached to outdated ideas of Britain as it once was. It’s quite possible this is the case, because I am not, for example, looking forward to the London Olympics later this year.

Then, we went to Lowe's and purchased wire mesh. The mesh was about $8 and is enough mesh to fix my non-existent screen door for the rest of eternity. Hubs asked why I bought so much, but that was all they had. It was not an option to buy just the small amount I needed. Depending upon the thickness of the mesh, you may need to purchase tin snips, but you could probably use scissors. I also purchased matte black spray paint at Walmart because I couldn't decide on another color, but any paint would probably work.

Mark’s lessons are perfect for school time. They are fairly short and extremely entertaining. My oldest children are at that age where everything is boring and unenjoyable unless they’ve done it before. (does anyone else have kids like this? ugh) After the first lesson they were SOLD. Begging for another right away, in fact. Of course I just smiled and said “not today, dearies!” (ha! teach them to be bored at me!)
She regularly hosts extravagant poker games in her villa with a superb garden. Often these poker games are catered affairs, and she thinks nothing of serving champagne that goes for 150 Euros a bottle. Even worse, she’d leave these expensive champagne bottles opened which would always lead to an unavoidable situation known as evaporation (of both money and champagne). Of course, Gianni is often called and asked to come over and actually serve the lunch because the girls are just too engrossed in their poker games.

It’s clear that parting company is difficult. It is even more difficult to achieve with both grace and autonomy. When we desire to take sovereignty of our own lives and our own spiritual paths are we truly the best judge of when we are ready? If it is not necessary to ‘cut the ties’ in anger, why is that so common? Is it a necessary stage of development to separate ourselves from our parents (biological or spiritual) in order to truly recognize our own sovereignty?

But in my heart of hearts, I enjoy helping people. I cannot help someone if I judge them rather than respect them; I cannot help them if I assume negative intent instead of positive intent; and I cannot help them if I cannot offer them compassion. The point is this: how do I - or you, or anyone else - change from a place of quick and perhaps unfair judgment, to a place where we can take a breath and try to be more compassionate? As I was thinking about how to come to grips with this in my own life, an example from my past came to mind that may just answer my question.

Meri will turn 12 in January. It is amazing how much she is growing up. One of her major achievements this year has been to get taller than her older sister. Maddy isn’t so pleased. Meri is in 6th grade and enjoying school. Her main interests include music, singing, sewing and Tae Kwon Do. She is working to earn her first degree black belt early in 2012. Meri is still sewing and designing. She entered a dress for the State Fair and placed 3rd in her division. Much of Meri’s summer centered on her dogs. She entered both “Duke” and “Ellie” in the county 4-H fair for obedience, and received purple ribbons. You’d never guess this from their behavior at home. Also this past spring, Ellie gave birth to 8 golden retriever puppies. From spring to the first part of July, Meri spent much of her time taking care of them, playing with them, and showing them off to perspective buyers. She made a nice income, especially when you factor in all the expenses (food, vet bills, advertising, etc) paid by me.
We saw a near-accident in Kanchi. I'm not sure how it happened because I was sitting behind our driver and didn't have a good view, but a motor cyclist had to stop or swerve suddenly and his wife lost her balance and fell off. Luckily, she was able to keep her balance as she landed on the road and didn't quite lose her footing and he stopped quickly enough not to drag her along as she held on. She must have scraped her feet on the road at the very least though and been wrenched as she twisted. They both looked shaken. We were far enough behind to stop easily, luckily.
Since July I have been experimenting with this new way of connecting. With Sonar by my side at networking events, I can go into a room and feel more at ease knowing industries people work in, what they do, and how I’m connected to them. This is a tool that I wish I had over a year ago, right after I graduated from college and jumped right into attending events alone.

There are many wonderful scenes which subtly, and sometimes a lot more explicitly with Ethel, get to the root causes of the issues faced by community. Broomfield takes his camera into the local school, where the emphasis on discipline acts as a cover for the real issues of poverty and unemployment. As Ethel notes, when the school send in the careers advisor, they might as well send along someone from the dole office as well. He also films in the local Birdseye chicken factory where an incredible scene of lines of women dismembering chickens was filmed with Broomfield being pushed on one of the factories trolleys around the room. Broomfield and the trolley pusher had failed to communicate beforehand when his assistant would stop pushing the trolley, and so they ended up doing the entire length of the factory.

Set in the wintry wilds of Maine, Winsome lives in a log cabin, alone apart from his dog, Hobbes, and surrounded by books (his father lined the walls with some 3,000 classics) that insulate him literally and metaphorically. The narrative is stark yet poetic, as we glimpse Winsome's harsh existence, a sense of forboding and loss quietly stirring. When a hunter flippantly kills his dog, it acts as a tipping point for Winsome who starts to unhinge: 'I didn't have feeling where I should and too much where I shouldn't. You keep away from men like me and you'll be alright in life.' His revenge - never fuelled by rage - is calm, meditative and murderous. It’s no surprise to learn Donovan is a poet, his precise language perfectly evoking the beautiful and austere landscape, to which the story is inextricably bound. This is a novel of wonderful contrasts: bleak but gentle; slow-burning yet tense; and the sympathy elicited for a killer we both understand yet don’t.

Of the 40 SUVS with third rows, only 14 are under $35,000 and if you look at those, only one is under $25,000- the Dodge Journey. The third row on most of these cars involves folding down a seat.

1) A new coffee maker. A. bought a coffee maker for himself when we moved to Albany, back in the days before I even drank coffee. That would be ten years ago. He bought the cheapest model available at Target, in keeping with our economic station (that is, really damn poor). And it just kept going. Not, however, without some minor inconveniences as it neared the end of its life. It got incontinent, leaking water from mysterious and indeterminable places. The basket part, which swung out to the side, wouldn't stay shut anymore unless I put a rubber band around it. So I used a leaking, rubber banded coffee maker for at least a year, reluctant to throw it away as it was in fact still performing its stated duty of making coffee, albeit while annoying the shit out of me every morning.
PLEASE, PLEASE READ THIS NEXT BIT AND BE AWARE I am showing you the step by step process of making a book from start to finish, therefore these videos are not 2 minute clips. It has taken me a lot of time and effort to make these videos and I have tried to make them as informative and short as possible. But ultimately I am making a hand sewn book from start to finish. If you don't have the time to watch them or have no interest in this type of thing, that is completely fine by me. I don't expect people to like or be interested in everything I do. I'm certainly not standing over you with a big stick.....honest, I'm not, heehee. Ohhhhhhh whats that behind you??? Only joking, lol. But for those who really want to see how books are made I need to let you know that if you are wanting to watch all the videos from start to finish, you may want to set aside an hour or so to sit and watch these videos. Either that or you could obviously watch them one video at a time as and when you get a spare few minutes as I have them broken up into sections. Either way, you aren't going to learn how to make a proper hand sewn book within a 2 minute video. So do be aware if you are on a 5 minute break blog hop or sneaking a few minutes nosey whilst the kids are eating.......you will not fit these videos in in that time unless you are watching them all separately over time. I just thought you should know this in case you thought it was a straight forward 5 minute video. BUT please don't take this to mean its hard to make a book. It really isn't. They are ridiculously easy to make, they just have different processes which need to be done and then bring them all together to make your book. They are so simple to make, you'll wonder why you havent made them before now.

When I was a teenager, I remember thinking that The Lord of the Rings should have had a follow-up, another series with the characters I loved so much. Aragorn's rule could have been in danger from the gathering of the remnants of Sauron lackeys or something like that. I eventually read almost all of Tolkien's other books but I still had this thought in the back of my mind. Anyway, it wasn't a realistic idea since the guy had already passed away...
