While the new Little Mermaid attraction will likely never be a must-ride for me, it’s a much-needed addition to California Adventure.

The film makes a preliminary case for itself in an eloquent preface: "If the human features of Hitler are lacking in the image of him that is passed on to posterity, if he is dehumanized and shown only as a devil, any future Hitler may not be recognized, simply because he is a human being."

The historic 1830s farmhouse that's home to this cozy boite brims with charm, heightened by the French Provencal dishes that populate its menu. There's nothing "haute" about Le Bistro, unless your perception (or rather, misconceptions) of the cuisine of France mistakenly veers toward snobbery.

to that. We don't have enough people who can read Chinese documents, we don't have enough trained economists that are thinking about Chinese policies and trying to assess what the impact is on the United States, and without a broad sense of that, I don't think we're able to respond as effectively as we could," he said in a recent interview in Washington.
Kabocha squash ravioli ($7) came to the table on a rectangular plate looking like Chinese dumplings, surrounded by sauteed mushrooms on one side and sauteed onions on the other.

I think the answer is looking at more innovative models instead of trying to replicate what is no longer there, Endicott says.
On one level, I applaud TV makers who are willing to take chances and break with the familiar narrative approaches. That's certainly part of the appeal of "Luck," from veteran movie director Michael Mann and writer-producer David Milch, who already stretched the boundaries of TV with "Deadwood," his HBO reconceptualizing of the Western. They embrace ambiguity and unconventional TV narrative methods, which can leave you wondering what's motivating the characters as they jaw at each other in racetrack-speak.

Have you ever watched one of those suspense thriller detective stories where there are dead bodies scattered across many states and the same suspect was on location in each state? You'd think it would be a slam dunk arrest. Suspect punished, and the citizens protected. But the suspect is rich and powerful and owns lawyers who successfully argue that the chemical compounds at each crime scene are found naturally to some extent in the environment. The lawyers further argue that even though the suspect uses these chemicals in large quantities, it cannot be verified that the deaths were actually caused by the suspect rather than by an unfortunate set of coincidental natural events.

But aside from the aspiring union lifers, what's in an Obama vote for the rest of the youth vote? The U.S. annualized growth rate in the first quarter this year was 2.2%. Perhaps the life raft is that provision in ObamaCare that extends health-insurance coverage to children living at home until the age of 26. If Barack Obama wins another four years, you may need it.
Mason doesn't have a specific highlight of his career that stands out, exemplifying his time in charge of the boys in orange. Rather, he cherishes the times when he sees his former players return to see him and update him on their progress.

"It seems as though you are just talking about a matter of timing—that Congress can regulate the transaction, and the question is when does it make best sense to regulate that transaction," said Justice Elena Kagan.

What may determine the success of this era is how much the new owners are prepared to invest in the team, developing a roster of top-tier talent and making necessary renovations to the stadium. Guggenheim Baseball Management, as the partnership is called, includes Lakers great Magic Johnson, entertainment industry executive and Golden State Warriors co-owner Peter Guber, and Stan Kasten, the former president of the Atlanta Braves and the Washington Nationals. Kasten will run the Dodgers. But it is Mark Walter, the chief executive of Guggenheim Partners — a company based in Chicago and New York that controls more than $125 billion in assets and provided the bulk of the funds to buy the team — who is the new controlling owner. The group purchased the team, the stadium and — in a joint venture with McCourt — the parking lots and other property for a record-shattering $2 billion, mostly in cash and without financing. No sports franchise of any kind has ever sold for that much.
He introduced Fain for Partita, which premiered in 2011. The challenging seven-movement solo work evolved from a simple, mournful tune into a passionate, virtuosic display, laced with Glass' iconic arpeggiation.

The L.A. riots of 1992 arrived with its soundtrack in place. Sanctioned police brutality, a grim job market, gang life, a decimated school system, the toll of crack on poor neighborhoods and racial tensions were all being documented by West Coast rappers long before Rodney King's beating by Los Angeles Police Department officers was documented on tape. Inner-city kids were infusing hip-hop — a genre that arose out of the Bronx in the last '70s — with hard-core, L.A.-centric rhymes about gangs and the crack-addled neighborhoods around them.

Gaborik's goal, his second of the postseason, was at once redemptive for him and his team. If there's an inherent drawback to the Rangers' style of play, it's that they leave themselves little margin for error. They scored four goals in their playoff opener, against the Ottawa Senators, but they haven't reached that total in any of their nine games since. Gaborik, their leading scorer during the regular season, had gone scoreless through his previous eight games, and he played most of Wednesday as if he were blindfolded, so much difficulty did he have in keeping the puck on his stick.
First, when it comes to competition, Tour pros care about two things -- winning majors and winning money. The Olympics will offer neither, at least not to the extent that the Tour does.

The NFLPA did not say when appeals might be filed, but said after the penalties were handed down that it would pursue all options on the Saints players' behalf.
That's the petit, our server whispers, eyebrow raised -- as opposed to the grand, which is three tiers and roughly double the price. Seafood platters are very much in vogue at this new Hollywood restaurant. All around us, at long tables peopled with pretty women in clothes ripped right out of the pages of W or Polyvore.com, guests are nibbling at pearlescent Kumamoto oysters, fat white shrimp and messier crab claws. It's perfect girl food: You can look busy even when you're not eating much.

Is Indiana willing to risk $4.3 billion in Medicaid money to strike a blow for the right-to-life movement? Some conservative members of Republican-controlled legislatures argue it's time for states to risk serious penalties to defend their principles and throw off federal mandates.

It also does not inhibit breathing, he said.
Let me make one last note. All of the reorganizations I have discussed.

The guys who ran sports books tell me they had never seen anything like it. This wasn't the smart money. It was the heart money. It was an avalanche of minimal bets so strong it actually swarmed over the ''smart money''. It came from the bellhops and desk clerks, the blackjack dealers and craps table stickmen, the bartenders and waitresses, the car parkers and chambermaids.

The Watchdog's analysis of municipal salaries presents some interesting data but fails to draw the salient conclusions. Employees of the city of San Diego earn in excess of six figures at twice the rate of the private sector workforce nationwide. This is astounding!

Fiscal reform is needed to prevent other cities from following Stockton into bankruptcy.

St. Louis County Library has just launched a new web-based catalog.
While the board has not disclosed its manner of selection, we do know that a majority opposed each finalist. Rather than demonstrating a lack of excellence, however, the impasse more likely resulted from a phenomenon known as cycling.

"I thought I was the fourth member of Beastie Boys in seventh grade. You couldn't tell me I wasn't. The first time I ever saw them on stage was a very early show of theirs before "License to Ill" came out, opening for Run DMC at Joe Louis Arena. My jaw dropped to the floor! Not only was I the only white kid in the place (as far as I knew) but I said to myself, 'Holy (expletive), there's other white kids that rap?!? WOW!' My mind was blown. ... MCA I know was at the forefront of this in the group, and for that I am forever indebted. When I heard the news, a crazy chill went through my body like no other. I don't wanna sound all dramatic, but that's the truth. ... My heart absolutely bleeds for my friend Mike D. and for Ad-Rock. Having lost a member of my own band, I understand a little of what it's like. I only hope in writing this that it brings a little comfort to his friends, family and fans, what an inspiration this man was and always will be to me. ...From one of your biggest fans, rest in peace homeboy.—Kid Rock, who inducted the Beastie Boys into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April

If voters seemed angry, so was corporate America. Obama led Congress into passing health care and financial regulation overhauls and pushed for climate legislation, all of which angered the business community.
There are implications to this. Because the young see the world differently, implicitly, their points of view challenge the unquestioned and consensual values of adults. One day, Stuart Little serves as a substitute teacher and asks his tiny charges what's really important in life. The kids do not mention wealth or fame or even, say, upcoming elections. They agree that what's really important in life is "the way the back of a baby's neck smells." Who's to say they're wrong?

His one concern for the future of Camden Yards stems, ironically, from what made it unique when it was built: its placement downtown may limit the ability for nearby development that could generate additional revenue. The St. Louis Cardinals and Baltimore-based Cordish Companies have planned to develop a "Ballpark Village" adjacent to the new Busch Stadium. Though the project stagnated during the economic downturn it has still inspired imitators, and several of the new spring training facilities Mock visited recently were situated on large plots of land where restaurants, condos and shops are expected to sprout.

Hamlin explained that part of the change in the balance of power was due to adjustments by crew chief Darian Grubb, and part was due to a change in weather conditions. The sun came out near the end of a blustery Kansas day, and that's when Hamlin's Toyota surged and Truex's faded.

To protect him from rival chiefs, the young "Pai'ea" was quickly hidden in Waipi'o, the remote Valley of the Kings. Today the six-mile-long, privately owned valley can be toured by horseback, mule-drawn wagon and passenger van (808-775-7121) — or you can hike the very steep road down to the black-sand beach (protect yourself by using bug spray, and not going swimming.) Although the valley was then home to thousands of Native Hawaiians, it's thought that his time here earned the young royal the name Kamehameha, "the lonely one."

You haven't the tools or the ability to come up with the right organization, contacts or information; people don't want to talk to you because of your disreputable tactics and stories and biases: many of the people you do talk to don't have the resources to give you accurate information: and regardless of whether you are working off accurate or inaccurate inputs, your conclusions are always accusatory against your target, as opposed to being the result of objective analysis."

Champagne actually started out as a happy accident, a cloudy, slightly sweet, light-red wine. Over the past 100-plus years, the application of science and technology advanced champagne so that most are dry (brut), clear and light. True Champagne is from the wine-growing region just northeast of Paris. Even when made with the exact same methods, sparkling wines made in the rest of the world will always be only sparkling wine. That's OK; fabulously cool and well-priced sparklers include cavas from Spain and proseccos from Italy.

Here is how John Boehner, the House Republican leader and a leading critic of the provision (and the health insurance bill), derided it when he spoke at the City Club of Cleveland on Aug. 24: "If a landscaper wants to buy a new lawnmower, or a restaurant needs a new ice-maker, they have to report that to the feds. If you're a mom-and-pop grocery store, and you buy $1,000 worth of merchandise from 15 different vendors, that's 15 different forms you have to file."

What matters, of course, is that it's hard to have the corner on one side playing one style and the guy on the other side playing another. And it's also hard to have a young, skilled corner such as Rodgers-Cromartie, brought here to start, trying to play the slot, which he adjusted to very poorly.

The first thing I saw when I drove into town was the whitewashed chapel of St. Michel atop a 30-foot tumulus that covered a tomb that contained prehistoric axes and ornaments. At its foot is the Hôtel Tumulus, built as a residence in 1900 by St. Michel excavator Zacharie Le Rouzic. It's still run by family members and thus an ideal place for amateur archaeologists. I checked into a simple, sunny room under a gable, swam in the pool and dined on fresh fish in the veranda restaurant.
But the new case presents challenges even Browne has rarely had to face — countering forensic evidence gathered by military investigators from a nearly inaccessible village half a globe away; eliciting sympathy for Bales' stressful combat deployments and previous brain injury from a panel of Army jurors; and playing the "put the war on trial" strategy to a U.S. Army tribunal.

"The rule we do have in our house is that if something is not on the table at mealtime, it's not on the table. I don't let my kids choose something else to eat.

City Controller Wendy Greuel says her office will investigate response times and whether they've been affected by the cuts, and that's overdue. The city should also work on discovering who was behind the Fire Department's misleading use of statistics, and why.

His motives were apparently mixed, as motives often are. He was passed over to replace J. Edgar Hoover as director of the FBI by President Nixon, who apparently wanted in that place not a Hoover man but a more malleable appointee. Mr. Felt was resentful. He believed Nixon meant to jeopardize the agency's independence. Here we have a hitch in the story. The liberal story line on the FBI was that under Hoover it had too much independence, which Hoover protected with his famous secret files and a reputation for ruthlessness. Mr. Felt was a Hoover man who joined the FBI in 1942, when it was young; he rose under Hoover and never knew another director. When Hooverism was threatened, Mr. Felt moved. In this sense Richard Nixon was J. Edgar Hoover's last victim. History is an irony factory.

Moderation: Trying to tackle too much at one time can lead to a variety of problems. Erosion, an invasion of weeds, storm damage and even injury are common effects when quality is sacrificed for quantity. Importantly, never clear more than can be replanted in one season, especially on slopes. Also, stagger the removal of shrubs and trees in dense groves. If too much of a grove is taken out at one time, wind, frost and sun damage is likely. Selectively remove no more than 30 percent of plants at a time and plan to come back in two years to remove another 30 percent.

See, I’ve never believed that government can or should try to solve every problem we've got. I believe that the free market is the greatest force for economic progress in human history.

But I also agree with our first Republican President -- a guy named Abraham Lincoln – who said that, through government, we should do together what we cannot do as well on our own.

And though young illegal immigrants often say that the United States is the only country they've ever known, if they traveled "back" to the land of their parents, they'd be doing the same as untold numbers of people who grew up in the U.S. but decided to migrate to foreign countries with unfamiliar cultures and complex languages to find opportunity. Just ask all the college students, architects, English teachers and recent business grads currently flocking to China, India and Brazil.

The next day, a furious Tracy abruptly quit the team and left the country. After two other "gaijin senshu" (foreigners) bolted from another, the league commissioner called for a ban on American players. Tracy had started a firestorm. Oddly enough, Randy Bass (of the old Denver Bears) arrived the next season and became a home run-slamming cult figure in Japan, and the prohibition on U.S. players never passed.
Silverman's opportunity to pick up the painting for $19,000 — the price made him hesitate; in hindsight, of course, what a stunning bargain — soon takes him, and his fortunate readers, into a fascinating adventure where scholarly detective work relies as much on specialized skills as it does on the miracle of technology.

Kelly McCutchen, president of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, the think tank that strongly supported H.B. 1176, predicted the process will take years. Safety valves, he said, could help inmates with their transitions back into society.

But Africans themselves shared much of the blame for the virus taking root, Halperin argues. Cultural norms in the region allowed men to have several wives, as well as multiple sexual partners outside of marriage. Those concurrent sexual relationships provided the tinderbox that allowed the spark of HIV to take full flame. Repeated analyses have shown, the authors argue, that AIDS became epidemic only in regions where the number of each person's sexual partners was high, either in African villages or in the gay enclaves of San Francisco and other western cities. The primary exception to that is its spread among drug abusers, who use contaminated needles to inject themselves.

“For me, I just know that when I’ve gone through spans of not playing, I really start to miss it a whole lote, and you realize that playing music is a big part of you,” added Greene. “Even if you’re not in a band, you’re still writing songs, because that’s just who you are. And then you start thinking, oh, what do I do with these? So it starts as a little thing… oh, let’s get together and just play a little while and have a few beers…and then after a while, you want to book a show. And then you’re in a band again.”

O.C. political consultant and former cop Steve Spernak took receipt of a $1 bill last week from the parents of slain L.A. sheriff's deputy David March shortly after March's killer pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life without parole.

He was finally brought to justice when Mexican courts rescinded a ruling that had prohibited the extradition of suspects who face life sentences in the U.S.

"Their 'D' has the ability to box guys out," Oshie said. "They've got some guys back there with some heavy crosschecks. It's part of the game, fighting through that and getting to the net. They've been doing a good job so far of blocking us out. We've got to keep our feet moving and eventually they're going to have to let us get to the front of the net, or we're going to draw penalties. It's a hard thing to do, but something that all 12 forwards need to be willing to do tonight."
The small tables are packed so tightly in the 51-seat dining room that it feels like a place you'd find in New York's East Village.

To facilitate this mandate, Michigan is required by this law to create an online exchange where residents can go to purchase their required health care benefits. If the state Legislature doesnt act the federal government threatens to seize control and do so under its terms. Many states, including Michigan, have questioned the constitutionality of the government forcing these mandates on our citizens, and the federal governments authority to force independent states to act. The case is now before the U.S. Supreme Court. Therefore, the Michigan House has decided that we will not act until the court rules on this constitutionality. Through the lawsuit and our actions in the Legislature, we are pushing back against a federal government seeking to force these onerous burdens and crippling costs on our citizens.

"It's pretty straightforward," Kitzhaber said, shortly after a public ceremony to sign House Bill 3650, the so-called health care transformation bill.

Racial profiling by police is notoriously difficult to prove. That's not, as former Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton used to insist, because it's uniquely difficult to get inside an officer's head and determine why he pulled over this suspect or that. Analyzing the intent behind offenses is actually fairly commonplace — it undergirds hate-crime prosecutions, many assaults (a murder, for instance, is distinguishable from manslaughter by the intent of the perpetrator) and even civil rights violations, which generally must be committed with the intent to deprive a person of a protected right. No, what makes racial profiling so hard to prove is that it's usually most apparent in statistics, not individual acts.
A former quarterbacks and wide receivers coach under Bruce, Tressel saw his wildly successful 10-year career in Columbus that included one national championship end because of his cover-up of the memorabilia sale scandal. Like USC's 2005 season, Ohio State's 2010 campaign has been vacated.

In Ohio, the birthplace of the NFL, the forum for the Buckeyes' 60 years of Big Ten dominance, football is hard-wired into the populace. Jim Tressel was practically part of the game's DNA.

For too many places in our state, the long-term prospects for economic growth are poor.
