For years, decades -- maybe even since the invention of tights -- women wore them only with boots or shoes. Pairing peep-toe shoes or sandals with opaque tights was so obviously wrong that it rarely made lists of "don'ts." Such advice was unnecessary, like suggesting women avoid blouses with three sleeves or telling men not to hit the office with their neckties knotted in nooses.

The best training for manners, again in my opinion, is at home (from parents), then in classrooms. I know: My brain is embedded in the 1940s and 1950s, but I still feel, with proper motivation from those who motivate, at least a modicum of the more prevalent behavior in those days could return, and actually make everyone a bit more happy with life. I think something called The Golden Rule was created for that purpose.

Maybe offer chores around the house or yard that they can handle and encourage them to save their allowance for it. Tell them you will pay for half and they can pay half, if this is feasible. Everyone, old and young, appreciates products and items that they themselves help to pay for. It is usually taken better care of and lasts longer. Later in life they will hopefully be able to apply lessons learned and perhaps be a more money savvy adult when they are grown.

Proper watering is the secret to successful transplanting
Removes a House teacher merit pay provision similar to language in Senate Bill 5, the state's controversial collective bargaining law which could be on the ballot this November.

The board couldn't inspect the clinic in response to multiple complaints it received in 2010 and last year about poor animal care and dirty conditions because the facility, then located on Leavitt Road, lacked the required board-issued license.

Wyoming soon, and when we sell our house, we would like to know if there is a safe way to take our peony bushes with us, in part if not in whole. Is there any way to make them send out new roots from a clipping so that you can get them in the ground in the new location? The area we're moving to is rather plain and could do with a splash of color. I also hate leaving these beautiful bushes completely behind, as we have watched them grow and bloom for 13 years.

That the film is turning up in theaters now is thanks in part to an Oscar nomination for feature animation.

Trying to capture a charismatic, bigger-than-life character on stage can be daunting, even when that remarkably charismatic character -- veteran San Diego blues vocal dynamo Candye Kane -- is playing herself. This holds especially true since Kane's real-life exploits offer more drama and intrigue per page than many carefully honed scripts by some of the theater world's most seasoned playwrights.

Of course, they are right to be concerned about the long-term deficit – if we don't get a handle on it soon, it can endanger our future. And at a time when folks are tightening their belts at home, I understand why a lot of Americans feel it's time for government to show some discipline too.

The designation establishes the areas where the urban growth boundary would be expanded in the coming decades and that would be developed for homes, businesses and industry. The map also designated 240,000 acres as rural reserves, meaning they would be set aside for agriculture, forestry or as significant natural areas.

Tom Moscovic, union representative for Willoughby-Eastlake teachers, described a number of concessions that will become effective only if the levy passes. The same concessions were offered by the union in November, but Thompson explained that the schools could not legally certify the contract because the failed levy left the district facing a budget deficit. Current concessions being offered include increased health insurance payments, two unpaid furlough days per year, step freezes and no pay increases for the duration of the two-year contract.

"Chinese food" and "vegetarian" don't often appear in the same sentence, and for good historical reason. Meat has long been a luxury for the Chinese, who are familiar with poverty and famine; having the means to put poultry, fish, pork or beef on the table is a point of pride. (Witness the traditional 12-course Chinese wedding banquet, which starts with a whole roasted suckling pig and proceeds from there through various manifestations of animal protein.) At the same time, the Chinese have plenty of dishes in which meat is more the condiment than the course. So it's not a stretch to create an entirely vegetarian Chinese menu, and that's what Green Wok has done.

“We just sat in a captains’ meeting, and we talked about probably our first tough film session prior to practice today,” he said. “Really, we’re asking the guys to listen to the message and to move on. I feel like that’s what this team has done all year. Our captains have been great leaders. The one thing they said in this brief meeting was, they’re looking forward to the opportunity of coming back and getting onto the field in two days, and that’s who they’ve been all year. So I fully expect that we’ll learn from it, we’ll move on, and hopefully get out to Denver and play our best lacrosse of the year.”

Readers also often tell me they wish The Star would go back to carrying more national and international news in print. One recent emailer was looking for coverage of a large anti-abortion demonstration in Washington, D.C., in the paper.

2) As a measure of the brutality of slavery in Haiti (then called Saint-Domingue), the majority of slaves, at all times in Haiti's colonial history, were African born. Both labor conditions and harsh treatment prevented the slave population from growing, so a constant influx of new slaves was required. This helps explain the strong, lasting influence of African culture among the slave population, particularly in the area of religion.
President Obama announced earlier this year that he also believed the law was unconstitutional and his administration would not defend it in some court cases.

Determination is something Rudolph, 31, has in abundance. He's a second-year law student -- in Michigan -- and commutes weekly from his home in Minneapolis in a Honda that just passed 300,000 miles. In September, his life will become even more fragmented when his partner -- Natalie Schultz, who also serves as the website's managing editor -- leaves for Yale to start work on a doctorate in science.

After the first Americans and long before most of our ancestors arrived in California, our neighbors from Mexico were naming cities and dividing our lands. For too long we have ignored Mexico. Unless we understand that California and Mexico are linked by history, geography, families and a common future, we will miss one of the great opportunities of the next decade.

Summers and Daye haven't played much but both played very well in Boston last night. So assume John Kuester will give them some burn. When you throw in Jerebko, who is a long 6-10, these athletic, tall guys are the future of the Pistons. I believe they have an attractive core because Bynum and Stuckey also are solid players. My issue with the Pistons is that they didn't need to trade Chauncey Billups and did so because GM Joe Dumars was afraid of holding on too long. As Billups is proving in Denver, that was an error.
In contrast to museums, medical centers are open 24/7, and the population passing through their doors includes people who might be reluctant to set foot inside a temple to the arts. And as long as human beings continue to get sick, hospitals will never have to worry about declining attendance.

So much so that they can concentrate on defense in the draft and Romo can focus on looking downfield rather than the rush on front of him.
It might not look like much more than a refurbishing - owner Mark Pastore replaced the carpet with a poured floor, added a banquette, a communal table and impressive wall images - but the meaningful part is that it gave Pastore and Cosentino a chance to take stock and refine what they do. For Pastore, it was to focus on the wine list and add some artisan beers; for Cosentino, it was to dig even deeper into the offal way of cooking.

With Albertsson's help, Kincaid combined her original condo with her rental unit next door, creating a single cohesive living space that would, of course, include a staircase to the hoped-for rooftop retreat.
And the previews themselves were dramatic affairs, with "The Scream" spotlighted in an otherwise dark room. “Our ambition was to do something really special to reflect the historic moment,” said Simon Shaw, head of Sotheby's Impressionist/modern department in New York. “I've never had the privilege of handling such a significant and memorable work of art, and I doubt I will have the privilege of doing that again.”

The Independent Oil and Gas Association of New York argues in comments submitted to DEC that some of the setbacks should be reduced or removed because they're arbitrary rather than based on scientific data or case studies. In other cases, it argues that DEC should grant waivers or exceptions when operators demonstrate that adequate protections exist. That's standard practice in Pennsylvania, West said.

In a report on the malpractice at Murdoch's now shuttered News of The World tabloid, legislators accused Murdoch and his son James of overseeing a corporate culture that sought "to cover up rather than seek out wrongdoing."
When locals talk about the Hurricane, they almost always get a little grouchy and/or wistful about how it used to be, back when it was small and uncomplicated. After a massive renovation in 1991, it's neither now. There's the outside deck on the ground floor with its picnic tables, crisscrossed fishing line overhead to thwart opportunistic gulls, the gulf across the street. Stormy's, a more upscale dining room, is upstairs. There's a third-floor rooftop club, and the bustling indoor dining room downstairs is done up in a shambling Florida Keys style. But that doesn't mean the culinary focus has shifted much. Still a solid grouper sandwich, fried, grilled, broiled, blackened or jerked.
Now if this were a Cinnabon challenge, that I could get into. But it's not.
Romney told newspaper editors and publishers Wednesday that Obama is exaggerating the likely impact of a House Republican budget plan Romney supports.

Romney said the plan instead would eliminate targeted programs such as the 2010 Democratic overhaul of health care.
In a five-decade career as one of the most successful recording artists of all time, Brown influenced generations of musicians and reached millions of fans with his fierce talent. He was also far from angelic — demanding, egotistical and prone to pulling a gun on those who disagreed with him. Brown used his fists when he needed to (which, in his view, was not infrequently), letting the punches fly on various victim (and included women he was bedding).

With today's busy schedules, it's not surprising that breakfast is sometimes skipped. In some cases, kids just don't want to eat breakfast. Whatever the obstacle, parents need to make breakfast a priority. Decades of research show the strong correlation between eating breakfast and school performance. Simply put, eating breakfast improves test scores and grades, increases children's ability to focus and concentrate, decreases irritability and behavior problems, and increases attendance.

Duane Nelsen's fascination began in the late 1980s, with a college assignment to write a piece of historical journalism. Because it was around 100 years after the murders ascribed to Jack the Ripper terrorized London's East End, lots of popular accounts were showing up to mark the anniversary, and Nelsen dived into them as part of his class research.
He finished the season with a .337 average, and on the verge of capturing the franchise’s first batting title. The Milwaukee Brewers' Ryan Braun needs to go at least 3-for-4 tonight to surpass Reyes.

This has revolutionized America's energy picture. Shale gas made up just 1 percent of our gas supply in 2000; today it represents 25 percent.
There were four rappers in the Pharcyde, two of whom were pretty similar. Imani and Booty Brown both had high voices and liked to horse around, but their jabs could be deadly when they wanted them to be. I have listened to the Pharcyde's albums hundreds of times and I still can't tell them apart sometimes. Slimkid3 was the deep thinker in the bunch, and one who developed a half-sung, half-rapped delivery almost two decades before Drake. But the best of the bunch was Fatlip, a former solo artist who was the last in and the first out. Fatlip remains one of the true unsung storytellers in '90s hip-hop, and "Labcabincalifornia" was his showcase. He's first up to bat on "Runnin'," and as he did all over the album, he sets the agenda with the story of a kid (probably him) who's pushed around until he finally lashes back. Like De La Soul on "Peas Porridge," you can tell that he knows that it's a waste of time to fight, and that he hates being dragged down to the level of his adversaries, but he knows it's his dignity at stake. Like much of "Labcabincalifornia," "Runnin'" was produced by the late J. Dilla, and he matches the storytelling here with a beat that is, like these four emcees, so sweet that you might miss the toughness underneath.
"La Cage" somehow manages to still feel fresh and lively even as the ruse falls apart in standard sitcom fashion.
Kuehster Road remains closed to non-residents " to promote continued safety and privacy as residents move back in the area," the the sheriff's office said. "Protecting the privacy of the home owners along Kuehster Road is a top priority."

ø"I understand the clamoring and what people say I should do, but at this point I don't feel like it's the right thing," Mattingly said earlier. "What's the alternative if you make a change and it doesn't work out? Do we just go down the list and keep trying guys? Is it a tryout camp at that point? My biggest concern with Javy last night was no swag. It's never his stuff. It was the lack of the bounce in the step and the confidence and commitment. That's what scared me."

The Oregonian's Aaron Fentress says: Edge to Oregon. Both programs certainly could make the case for needing to win, but the desperation factor tips in Oregon's favor. Losing three consecutive BCS bowl games and a fifth consecutive game against a strong nonconference opponent would certainly leave at least a small stain on an otherwise magnificent three-year run of success.

As I mentioned, Murphy is a paralegal. She looked up the city tax code that had been mentioned in her summons. That would be Chapter 5.22. It consists of 17 sections. She could find nothing in any of those sections that would require a return from a person who had no earnings to report.
Gu was as charismatic and ambitious as her husband. Fresh out of the prestigious Peking University law school, she opened a practice that she described in a brochure as the "first independent law office founded by a woman in China." She called it Horus L. Kai, a name she often used for herself, the first part borrowed from the Egyptian falcon deity representing war, sun and hunting.
In the early stages of the unrest, the violence was largely confined to poor areas marked by high unemployment and social deprivation. That pattern has shifted at times, however, as riots broke out in Gloucester, a market town in western England normally immune to social unrest. Nine people were arrested after a gang of youths smashed shop windows and threw bottles and rocks at police vehicles.

"I was equally impressed with Ryan," Shurmur said. "Very intelligent young man. Did a nice job in the interview.

"I really didn't want to run and was hoping for someone to run who reflected the criteria of reform," he said. "This county has been governed by kings -- people who took everything away from people.

The plan, which is already provoking debate, would maintain the central Board of Regents for such overarching policy matters as admissions standards, state funding and top appointments. But it contends that UC has gotten so complex and governance has become so balky that campus governing boards should be established and given autonomy over many issues, similar to states in a federal system.
The 84th Academy Awards, broadcast on ABC, also marked the return of Billy Crystal for his ninth hosting stint. Crystal opened the night by inserting himself into a montage of big films from "The Artist" and "The Descendants" to "Midnight in Paris." He bumped into Tom Cruise crashing through a window, a la the latest "Mission: Impossible," and barged into the desperate bathroom scene in "Bridesmaids."

It was an illuminating reference. Mr. King's predecessor, who served as governor for 24 years, was highly controversial in his time: a hugely powerful figure who, blinded by dogma, played a lead role in the disastrous decisions of the 1920s that led to a global depression and ultimately the nationalization of the BOE.

Some individuals in the study probably had developed pain conditions legitimately requiring use of opioid medications. But it’s also possible that use of the medications created dependence in other patients, the authors noted.

But, Rosenheim says, Evans came to realize he was using a borrowed European style to photograph the American scene and slowly began to move toward the "down-home, Americana approach" of his iconic work. His first forays in true documentary photography were the shots he produced for Carleton Beals' 1933 book "The Crime of Cuba." Since Cuba was then under the dictatorship of Gerado Machado y Morales, Evans had to make his powerful street portraits of everyday Cubans -- a number of which are on display at the Cantor exhibit -- without drawing attention to himself, an almost guerrilla style of photography he would return to later in his career.

In fact, Sheehan could know more about pool tables -- how they are put together, how they can be repaired and how they should be transported -- than just about anyone in Portland. Anyone, that is, except his father, also named Patrick Sheehan, who taught him everything he knows.
In August, this banyan- and palm-dotted maze of vendors selling T-shirts, souvenirs and crafts surprisingly became home to a near-revolutionary dinner show, starring one of Hawai'i's most impressive young artists and exploring some of its oldest traditions. The popularly acclaimed "Return to Waikiki" stars slack-key virtuoso Makana, who inaugurated last summer's "Curators of Hawaiian Music" concert series at the renovated Royal Hawaiian with an enormously popular cocktail show riffing on the origins of the genre. Now he's back with a hot band, hula dancers and characters to tell the story of how chant and drum evolved into song — and how the ancient Polynesian culture that brought them to the islands pervades even a place like Waikiki.

Aardman, those meticulous Brits who build clay models and painstakingly animate them into Wallace and Gromit cartoons and the hit "Chicken Run," tip their hand that way with "The Pirates! Band of Misfits." A pirate picture that's entirely too late to the party to have much in the way of fresh pirate gags, it is stuffed with big-name voice actors: Hugh Grant, Salma Hayek, Brendan Gleeson, Imelda Stanton, Anton Yelchin and Jeremy Piven.
The Department of Education in July began implementing a law requiring all school board members and charter school trustees to undergo criminal background checks, including fingerprinting.

In contrast, "The King's Speech" though set in the 1930s was positioned by its Oscar campaign as a timeless story about friendship, loyalty and courage. And while characters can't get more elite than King George VI, his struggle for a voice made him far easier to relate to than anyone in "The Social Network." It played to rousing receptions at its first screenings at the Telluride and Toronto film festivals, and even Oscar producer Bruce Cohen emerged from an early showing declaring "The King's Speech" a shoo-in for a best picture nomination.

Everyone gawked. I stifled a laugh. “I thought to myself, ‘This guy is crazy’,” offensive lineman Nick Cody says in a video he co-produced on UO strength and conditioning. “... As I kinda got to know more about him and his dedication, I learned the method to the madness.”

Afterward, we headed up to the mini-golf course. It's not fancy, but the kids loved it. Then we hopped on a little train that runs through the campground. Most days, you pull up to the ranger station and go "wake up" Yogi, who is sleeping at a pic-i-nic table (I can't tell you how many dads have mastered the Yogi voice).

“I was going to walk off one film.” Hopkins says. “The director — who shall remain nameless — was horrible. Horrible. Very controlling, very in your face — I finally told him, ‘You put your hand on me one more time and I’ll deck you, I mean it.’ He was very difficult. So I became difficult as well. The funny thing is, it actually turned out to be quite a good film, because he was talented. But he was an absolute control freak and I can’t stand that. I’ve had two or three others like that over the years and I tell them, ‘You know, you want to work like this, you’ve cast the wrong actor.’”

One of the all-time greats. And Margaret Hamilton is still scary as the Wicked Witch of the West, no matter how old you are. Songs aren't shabby, either. ...

On a recent dinner visit, the main courses were the weak link, and -- after starting off so promisingly -- we sat for nearly an hour waiting for them to arrive. I think the roast chicken ($18) must have been waiting the entire time; it was so dry and mealy by the time it was served that it would have needed a cup of herb butter sauce to bring it to life, rather than just a pat melted over the top. It was served with a nicely dressed bunch of watercress. Wild king salmon with a red pepper aioli ($24) on a bed of sweet corn and zucchini was surprisingly bland, given the mix of ingredients.

"I guess I never need to go to a psychiatrist," Loretta Lynn observes in the forward to "Honky Tonk Girl," "'cause I get everything out in my lyrics." Plenty of songwriters would say that they, too, get everything out in their lyrics, but that doesn't nix their need for a shrink. But then Lynn, whose newest book is subtitled "My Life in Lyrics," is less complicated and pretentious than most.

It's my eyes that are seein' what I write about. And my heart that's feelin' all those things."

Place a clove of garlic in the peeler, and, using downward pressure, roll back and forth until you hear a crinkling sound. You'll have a clove without a trace of skin. If you must peel by hand, lightly cover the cloves with olive oil and peel with your fingers. Or place a clove on a cutting board with the flat side of a knife blade on the top. Hit the blade with your fist or heel of your hand. The skin should peel off easily. Remove the root end and any brown spots or green sprouts.

Q: I feel Hoboken has a great music scene at least from the musician’s point of view. I can’t speak for the audience. The musicians and bands here in Hoboken stick together and gig together not just locally but out of town. I think the problem today is many that go to bars couldn’t care less for interesting or innovative live music. We are living in the mp3-cellphone-Internet world where many would rather stare at their cell phones then experience the physical world around them. This is also how most people today prefer their music source: Compressed mp3s on their cell phones rather than a kick-ass, thunderous, epic sound of a live band digging deep into their souls and spilling blood from their hearts all over the stage. I think some nights if I lit myself on fire or hung myself on stage, many bar goers would continue their Facebook status updates and not notice. But I don’t want to sound like cynic, I still love playing for the few hopeless romantics in the audience.

Regain control. Not long ago, business experts advised stressed-out employees to talk with their boss about unrealistic job duties and late nights -- or look for a better job. In a down economy that may not fly. So find ways to feel in control; it's crucial for beating burnout. Make prioritized to-do lists.

Viewed from close range, the work creates a startling contrast between the two-dimensional smudges and the hard, shiny chunks of graphite. Both seem to have been fused to the wall in a single, cataclysmic natural event, like the explosion of a volcano.

But Portland is something else: the new face of America's maverick food cart movement. We know this because no one else puts it together like we have -- the volume of experimenters, the variety, the pedigreed ingredients (duck confit on the best baguettes at $5.50 -- are you kidding?!) and the punk-rock shacks. As Next Generation food creatives abandon the heat -- and expense -- of restaurant kitchens to create their demented little houses on the prairie, they are inventing their own model of modern restaurateuring.

Temporarily slicing that additional government spending by $450 billion, by executive order, would likely stand up in court as an emergency measure.

"Quite frankly, if you go down the roster this year, there is no reason why we shouldn’t have made a Super Bowl run," McElroy said. "The talent top to bottom is pretty remarkable. It’s a disappointing thing, is the fact that it doesn’t matter how much talent you have, if you don’t come together as a group, and kind of just figure things out, and try to withstand the difficulties of the season, then you are just never going to amount to anything. (Alabama) Coach (Nick) Saban preached that over and over again, and I think this is probably the first time that it ever really applied, because you had people that refused to buy in.

While we have made much progress as a nation during my lifetime, this awful incident and subsequent demonstrations have made it clear we still have a long way to go before the American Dream is truly open to all.

As might be expected, the most common coin to find is the penny. The cost of manufacturing pennies is said to be greater than their value, so periodically Congress proposes doing away with them. In fact, a supposed expert claimed newly minted pennies are only used once. I can certainly attest to the fact that this is not the case, because I occasionally find wheat pennies from the 1950s. I've even found World War II-era steel pennies. Maybe it is a sign of our down economy that people are raiding their piggy banks.

Parts of Collins Avenue and Ocean Drive that have been known largely in recent years for their run-down Art Deco hotels are getting a second wind. On Collins, the Royal Palm is being turned into the James Royal Palm, which will feature an outpost of the Catch restaurant and a nightlife venture from Meatpacking District moguls EMM Group.

San Juan Unified School District, which serves the area, has an open enrollment policy, so students can apply to attend the school of their choice if they meet the requirements and guidelines. Because Fair Oaks-area schools are desirable, and some larger properties have space for horses, home prices tend to stay higher in Fair Oaks than in other areas, Smith said. According to TrendVision’s June figures, the average asking price for homes on the market was $346,000. Zillow.com lists home prices ranging from $119,000 for a three-bedroom, one-bathroom home to $525,000 for a home withthree bedrooms and three bathrooms. More pending sales — 56 — are on the market now than at this time last year, which is good, Locke said. And he sees more homes for sale. “More inventory equals more opportunities for buyers to select products,” he said. Fair Oaks’ downtown is the village, which has a hardware store, a yardage shop, several restaurants and other specialty shops. Residents can find everything they need at several shopping malls — including one, Locke said, that has the largest metal rooster in the world at its entrance.
Turner used a .243-caliber hunting rifle to shoot Singh. The bullet struck the officer in an area that wasn't protected by his ballistic vest. It tore through one of his kidneys and into his colon before fragmenting to leave a 3- to 4-inch hole in his back. Singh told jurors that he lay on the ground unable to move his legs and used his elbows to drag himself back behind a tree as bullets continued to whiz by.

The quick take: The key is to find wines that are fruity, softer, bright and less tannic. So the hands-down winner - if you've read a Thanksgiving wine story before, you're already mouthing the answer - is Pinot Noir. Also: Beaujolais, or other wines made from the Gamay Noir grape. With too much oak, Merlot can be overwhelming, but plusher ones can offer red fruit and pleasant tea aromas that cut through the bird's richness. Or go the other way - look for more robust wines with age on them that highlight the savory notes in the gravy and meat. Skip aged Burgundies here; they need something more subtle. Try older Cabernet, or perhaps a good aged Bordeaux or Brunello.

Another theory is that these been-there-done-that feelings are a result of one eye sending information to the brain faster than the other. Almost everyone has a dominant eye; if that stronger eye sends information to the subconscious before both eyes focus and register the input as a conscious experience, your brain will tell you, "I've seen that before." And you have -- but it was just a nanosecond ago. Or maybe you've just "seen" it on the computer or TV.

Ms. Jacobs said she is facing rising costs of $120,000 more a year for police and $200,000 more for fire protection. We asked if the city might consider saving costs by switching to a volunteer fire department. She replied that the city still has 20 years to go in its contract with the Orange County Fire Authority. And she said that the city already has contracted out for many services, such as for attorneys and street sweeping, so it can't save much money through more outsourcing.
