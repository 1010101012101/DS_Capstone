The sale of the mill in 1986 to a Houston-based investment group backed by notorious "junk" bond financiers Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken accelerated local logging, changing the equilibrium in the area.

That's the main rationale that has guided the Obama and Bush administrations, which have tried to keep the largest financial institutions liquid and solvent by making multibillion-dollar investments in them (typically by buying nonvoting shares of stock). This approach has its share of problems too. First, there's something fundamentally unfair about seizing small banks but not large ones. Second, using taxpayer money to keep a bank afloat protects the investors who hold its debt, much of it in the form of speculative and opaque derivatives that have contributed to the financial industry's woes. And it's not as if those investors were naifs -- they had professional advisors. If the bank were seized, they wouldn't be so insulated from the pain. Third, the Obama and Bush administrations have required numerous banks to take the government funding so as not to stigmatize the ones that truly needed the money. As a consequence, investors have lost confidence in all of them.

PLANTING: If you love gooseberries and currants (Ribes), dip cuttings into rooting hormone and stick them into well-drained ground, out of the wind, near the foundation. Though some root readily by spring, others don't, so I'm cautious and dip all of them. Cover them with a row cover for extra protection and to keep garden denizens such as birds and squirrels from pulling them out of the ground. Leave the rooted plants in place for a year and then transplant them to their permanent home. You'll have saved $10 or so per plant. If you need plants to get started, look for 'Crandall' and 'Swedish Black,' which have great black-currant flavor; 'Swedish White'; and 'Rovada', a very good red cultivar. Look for 'Hinnonmaki Red' or 'Hinnonmaki Yellow' (often spelled Hinnomaki) gooseberries.

The road to a proper showcase for the Mexican Museum's extensive permanent collection — generally recognized as the country's best collection of Mexican and Mexican American art, most of it unseen — stretched more than 15 years that saw a capital campaign tank in the wake of the dot-com bust, a three-year shutdown and abandonment of a handsome six-story design by Ricardo Legorreta, Mexico's most prominent architect until his death on Dec. 30 at age 80. But persistent efforts finally gelled with the now-disbanded San Francisco Redevelopment Agency's release of $10.5 million for the project and the California Cultural and Historical Endowment's $800,000 planning grant to design and develop the new museum.

Gerson is exactly right, but I don't propose to use his admirable column as an excuse to pile onto the religious right. Instead, I want to suggest that what should most bother Christians of all political persuasions is that there are right and wrong ways to apply religion to politics, and much that's happening now involves the wrong ways. Moreover, popular Christianity often seems to denigrate rather than celebrate intellectual life and critical inquiry. This not only ignores Christian giants of philosophy and science but also plays into some of the very worst stereotypes inflicted upon religious believers.

At several players' request, the Cardinals pushed up their batting practice Wednesday to avoid the shadows cast across the infield. Last year, midafternoon games drew criticism from hitters because they said it was difficult to see pitches when shadows sliced between the mound and home plate. The team did not schedule any midafternoon games voluntarily this season. They'll continue to move BP around if the players are willing to arrive early, Matheny said, because "batting practice is about getting comfortable with your swing."

There’s nothing calming about director Niels Arden Oplev’s style, which is fast and furious and smartly mirrors content.

On the other hand, animal studies show too much folic acid, the pill version, can spur some cancers. There's scant human evidence. But when researchers studied people prone to precancerous colon polyps, those who took high-dose folic acid -- 1,000 micrograms a day -- for three years had more new polyps than people given a dummy pill. And in March, researchers tracked 640 men from that earlier study and found that 10 years later, the folic acid users were more likely to have developed prostate cancer.

My coronary arteries were so big, the doctor said they were like a garden hose. Because the hose was so big, that big piece of plaque finally got dispelled and pushed through.

4. Part of the pre-series buildup has focused on the mobile young defensemen on each side, Alex Pietrangelo (Blues) and Drew Doughty (Kings). Doughty was the No. 2 overall pick of the 2008 draft, and Pietrangelo went two selections later. With space expected to be tight up front, the offense generated from the blue line could be an important factor in this series. If so, the Blues could have an edge in the presence of Kevin Shattenkirk, a second mobile young defenseman. He had nine goals and 34 assists this season. The Kings have their version of Pietrangelo, but there's no Shattenkirk on the LA side.

Statistics to verify reported increases of bedbug infestations are hard to come by. That's because homeowners, landlords and businesses typically are not required to report infestations to local or state health officials.

The 6-foot-2, 225-pound Reschke is one of the better athletes at the linebacker position in the Midwest, and that athleticism was on display Saturday. He started off by showing off his speed and explosiveness in the pass-rushing drills, winning every rep we saw him in. Where Reschke really was strong, though, was in pass coverage. He plays extremely well in space and has the speed to close passing lanes. His ability to diagnose plays and passing routes looks to be improving and physically he continues to be an impressive looking athlete.

"I remember telling people 20 years ago on my show to 'Hear me now: Water will be the issue in the future,' " James says. "It still seems as though people have not heeded the warning. We've taken it for granted for so long that you turn on the spigot and the water will flow. In certain areas, drought has forced them to consider it, but even if the supply is plentiful, conservation is still the best path to follow."
Asked what his biggest concern is for the U.S. economy, Geithner, more seriously, replied: "It should be a dominant concern of Americans as to whether the political system we have in this country, in a country so divided, is going to be able to start doing things, not just fighting about them. No economy can be stronger than the capacity of its political system to do tough things."

But the drone attack has raised questions about the power of the U.S. government, and specifically the president, to target and kill American citizens who have been neither indicted nor convicted of specific crimes. Even those who, like us, consider the killing a reasonable and defensible act of national self-protection, need to confront the issue -- and whether the government should provide more information.

If Beinart wants to argue that the Sasson study should have sampled a greater number of "cultural Jews," fine. That's a discussion worth having. But to use the word "only" when he means "mostly" should alert readers that no assertion of fact in The Crisis of Zionism can be taken at face value.

Thomas Jefferson, the greatest intellectual that the United States has produced, wrote in the Declaration of Independence that governments are "instituted among men" to preserve the rights to "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness," or in more Lockean terms, "Life, Liberty and Property." Therefore, the only legitimate ends of government is to defend these rights. Any government program that does not defend these rights — or as is the case in the United States today, is actually destructive to these rights — is not only a waste of money, but also illegitimizes the American regime. In the United States today, money is wasted by the billions in "defense" (a nice way of saying global policemanship), entitlement programs, education, bailouts (corporate cronyism), general inefficiency, the interior, transportation, and so on. In fact, with the exception of a court system and a basic system of a non-standing army, much of the United States government today is a complete waste of taxpayer dollars — such a waste that it calls for the "People to alter or abolish" the current United States government.

A no vote would repeal it.

Parents who lie for convenience's sake, by calling in "sick" at work to attend a sporting event, for example, suggest truthfulness doesn't matter. Or they might give mixed signals, such as, "Get A's at all costs," but "Don't cheat," fostering the kind of stress that can lead to cheating.

He is also averaging 3.0 turnovers a game, which puts him in the top 10 of starting point guards.

This soup - which is inspired by, not a re-creation of, Zakarian's - is incredibly flexible. I like the extra layer of flavor you get by roasting the onions and garlic.

Amy Adams is easier to take — she has a pretty voice, and gets to do a sort of I-will-survive disco number.
