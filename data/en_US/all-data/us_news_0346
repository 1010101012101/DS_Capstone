John Morton, who heads U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said his agency will not necessarily process illegal immigrants referred to them by Arizona officials. The best way to reduce illegal immigration is through a comprehensive federal approach, not a patchwork of state laws, he said.
"When I came back, I talked about one of the problems we have, which was we can't get a building for these kids to do recreational activities in," he said. "I know from living in the 2nd Ward that Donald Scurry and my nephew had a beef from 13 or 14 years old. They were out on the streets, and they inherited this beef from grown men, and it culminated. And that's not only why we lost Rakeem, that's why we lost my mother too."

But based on an old identity card that experts said proved he turned guard at the infamous Sobibor death camp, Demjanjuk was found guilty last May in a Munich court of 28,060 counts of being an accessory to murder. The conviction was unprecedented, since it came purely on the grounds that he had served as a guard rather than tying him to a specific killing.
"Gov. Nixon believes that St. Louis is ideally suited to host the 2012 convention," said spokesman Jack Cardetti. "Obviously this is a long selection process, and Gov. Nixon looks forward to working with St. Louis and other Missouri Democrats to put our best foot forward."

Unlike Tseng, Corona, who specializes in the treatment of mood disorders, has not been named as a target by state medical investigators or federal drug authorities. But records show that Corona is on five years probation with the state medical board for using drug samples to treat his own manic disorder. Additionally, a lawsuit filed in Orange County Superior Court in 2007 accuses him of negligence and wrongful death for his treatment of a woman who crashed her car while driving under the influence of prescription drugs, killing a young mother. Corona calls the suit "nonsense."
And the puzzle is waiting.
Hadley said he was hospitalized in Florida for eight days after becoming ill, and later had another stay of one day. The first time he went in he had a temperature of 103.7 degrees, and it was determined his white blood cell count was extremely high. He underwent tests that showed he had E. coli, pneumonia and that several of his organs were infected. And he received a stern message from a doctor: "If we don't contain this thing and it spreads into your bloodstream, it can kill you."

Obama reacted to the bad news Friday much as he absorbed the better-than-expected job reports in January and February: accentuating the positive elements while conceding it was not enough. The economy, he noted, created 130,000 private-sector jobs, while the unemployment rate dropped to 8.1 percent from 8.2 percent.

"This is not a place to make a fashion statement for yourself," said Sally Kilbridge, deputy editor of Brides magazine. She ticks off more don'ts, including no miniskirts, plunging necklines and novelty socks, which have become a surprising trend at least among guests at American weddings.
"It is reassuring to know that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has assumed a lead role in working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and other partners to coordinate data collection, as well as a response plan to address the wide range of potential scenarios and threats generated by the debris field," wrote Wyden. "As you move forward, I hope that NOAA will prioritize the development of a response plan for West Coast states and help communities and agencies along the coast plan and prepare for any eventualities related to the arrival of this debris. This might, for example, include establishing toll free numbers and websites to assist the public."

Critics have argued that the U.S. has the worst healthcare in the developed world. Most who believe this use the infant mortality and life expectancy indicators debunked above. The U.S. does perform worse on so-called avoidable deaths amenable to medical treatment. This measure likewise has many flaws, not the least of which is that such deaths constitute only a fraction of overall deaths. A more relevant comparison might be cancer, which is the second-leading cause of death in the United States. Cancer patients live longer in the U.S. than in any other country.
Authorities said they are sometimes able to determine when a homicide will take place -- such as a dispute involving drugs or gang territory -- and then take steps to arrest those involved before someone is killed.
Sen. Diane Rosenbaum, D-Portland, argued that the measure is necessary to help Oregonians struggling to find work in a deep economic recession.
The measure contains cuts supplied by six different House committees and includes changes to the food stamp program that would remove almost 2 million recipients through tighter enforcement of eligibility rules and would cut back a 2009 benefit increase, costing a family of four $57 a month.

So, instead of local police departments turning a blind eye to illegal immigration, they would have to make it their highest priority, pursuing violations even if it hindered the investigation of other crimes. I suspect the people of Arizona would prefer a policy somewhere in between those two extremes.
Matt Liffering kept things going as emcee, Mayor Don Hansen tasted and talked to many admirers, and I overheard one very full man tell someone that he thought he may not eat again for several days. Yes ... it was that good.

A. Well, a lot of what a director does, the aesthetics of it, is a matter of taste, and what I was trained in, what I was interested in, was a very classical style. I was a big fan of Howard Hawks, who was very straightforward. But also of Marcel Ophuls, who had these obsessive tracking shots. You can’t always do one or the other. You have to balance the approach… Mostly it’s just finding the right angle to tell the story.
Once classes started, Hernandez began tracking results from periodic exams, tallying them on sheets of paper marked with colored dots. Green meant progress, pink meant backsliding.

Talk about a woohoo party. The Clevelander has all sorts of memorabilia from local teams on the walls. But what makes this place loud, louder and loudest is the wahoo crowd. It doesn't matter if it's Browns, Cavaliers or Indians season -- they're always ready to party. Maybe it has something to do with the rah-rah local sports memorabilia on the walls. Or the cheap pitchers of beers and bar food and the people who love to mow 'em down. Or that's its so close to Progressive Field and the Q that you can stagger there in five minutes.
The Blazers have worked out one possible center candidate, DJ Mbenga, and he later signed with the New Orleans Hornets. The Blazers do not have concrete plans to evaluate any other free agent candidates, but that's an option Cho "possibly" would consider in the future.

Between them, Harmonic and Omneon already count the world's 20 largest video content companies as their clients, including such brands as CBS, CNN, BBC and Televisa. The new company, they say, will boast 450 engineers (among more than 800 employees) who will work on next-generation delivery technologies. One initiative, Harshman said, could change the way video of a live sporting event is broadcast to a home or laptop, improving the quality of the image in the process.

It was a defeat that highlighted what is becoming something of a chronic bad habit of sluggish starts for the Capitals, who have given up the first goal in eight of their past 11 road games. Against the Sabres, who ended a three-game losing streak with points from 10 different players, the ditch into which Washington dug itself proved too big to climb out of.

Certainly, Giffords became a lightning rod in the year before she was attacked by Loughner: targeted on an election map by Sarah Palin, disparaged for her "yes" vote on the healthcare bill. Certainly, Arizona is a state with many problems, perhaps most centrally, Zoellner suggests, its lack of a population with deep roots. Still, there's no particular evidence that the Giffords shooting has anything to say about the place itself. What is it about Arizona? For all that Zoellner wants to connect the dots, if his book has anything to tell us, it's that this could have happened anywhere.

In addition to the complete reviews, TripAdvisor posts a composite five-dot rating (in half-dot increments) for each hotel based on all of the individual inputs. The site covers thousands of cities and resort areas. Although based in the United States, its scope is not limited: You can find lots of reviews for Cuba's Varadero Beach, for example, submitted by Canadians and Europeans who are not barred from going there. It also shows reviews for several hotels in Teheran, Iran, and even covers six hotels in Pyongyang, North Korea. My main problem is that it posts so much content for popular areas and hotels that negotiating all that detail is sometimes cumbersome.

Like many bands formed in the early 1980s, the Smithereens looked backward to go forward. Frontman Pat DiNizio’s understanding of the mod and psychedelic movements of the ’60s is apparent in his songwriting. But he also was raised in the unfashionable Garden State suburbs. His tastes and attitudes were formed by many of the same dark forces that animated the Turnpike metal movement.

Even with Daniel Craig having portrayed James Bond twice now, people still talk of you playing 007.
Théophile Haumesser: With his versatility, his attitude and his abilities, Nicolas has always been the type of player that coaches dream about. What he proved this year was that he could also be consistent and that he could be more aggressive, which probably were his two main flaws during his first two years in the league. When he had to come off of the bench this season, he took it as a challenge and it worked out pretty well, giving Nate McMillan even more flexibility in his rotations. There's no way that the Blazers should think about letting him go, especially when he'll have an opportunity to step up his game and gain even more confidence this summer when he'll play for the French National Team at the European Championships in Lithuania. For France to have a chance to advance in this tournament, Nico will have to become one of the two main scoring options alongside Tony Parker and embrace his role as a leader. If he manages to do so, Blazers fans probably won't have to ask themselves that question (whether he stays or goes) ever again.
I never understood how Weber, not exactly Jay-Z cool, related to 16- to 21-year-olds. But Meyers Leonard's tweets Friday made it clear: "Coach Weber will always have a special place in my heart.

The substance, called shilajit, is an ancient ayurvedic medicine. On websites, you'll read that it has anti-anxiety, "rejuvenating" and aphrodisiac properties and is a panacea for many ills, from diabetes to bronchitis — and, further, that it was praised by Aristotle, prized by Genghis Khan and was the closely guarded secret weapon of Soviet cosmonauts and Olympic athletes.

You can order a combination platter if you want to try several different things, or choose from the appetizers, entrees, side dishes and about eight homemade desserts. Prices are extremely reasonable, there's a depth of flavor in every bite and even the falafel ($7) is a surprise. Instead of the usual deep-fried brown brick, it's a large, quickly fried round ball with a light, soft green, ground chick pea and fava bean center seasoned with fresh herbs.

A: We do not have a good answer yet. We are conducting clinical trials to try to answer this question. Based on my experience, the majority of cancer patients I have treated did show some improvement after acupuncture treatment, although not everyone responded to it.

For Roney, it will be an experience to remember. She is eager to have her 10-year-old granddaughter, who is on her school track team, see her at the finish line. Like everyone else, Roney will have a racing bib -- and will get a finisher's medal.
My favorite was Roy's new munchie ($7.99) on wheat. The cold rare roast beef sandwich was layered with creamy avocado slices, havarti cheese and a light brush of Thousand Island dressing. My colleagues raved about the hot pastrami mommi ($8.29) topped with havarti, sliced pickle and some of that sublime garlic mayo; and the Dagwood ($7.99) a behemoth of hot ham, turkey, bacon, Swiss cheese, tomato, avocado and tangy Parmesan mayo.
In 1993, community activist Don Cribb approached Mike McGee, gallery director for CSUF, with his vision to transform the former market into the institutional centerpiece for a 10-block village.

The new theater, slated for official opening in the fall, will be operated by the performing arts center.

"Because of the nature of these types of negotiations, and if Peyton has a good year, he'll have opportunities now because you'll enter in free agency -- legitimate free agency," Holmgren said.

Factor in the slow pace and the difficulty soars. Ordinarily, I have little use for 15- and 25-lb. dumbbells, but with ChaLean, these weights felt gigantic. Failure came early and often.
Portland has provided fertile ground for food carts to sprout, the authors say. Already known as a foodie hotbed for its many brick-and-mortar restaurants and experimental gastronomic nature, there's no dearth of kitchen creativity on the food front. Add financially stressed times, few regulations or oversight (except rigorous food safety standards) and the lower-key, lower-overhead operations of food carts become a serious catalyst for a robust cart contingency, rivaled by few cities.

"My face and body kind of looks like a monkey," Ito said, "so from a young age everyone used to tease me, saying 'monkey, monkey'. But I wasn't really bothered because I really liked them, and somewhere inside of me I had this ambition to adopt one of their traits. So when I occasionally saw a monkey that could run fast, I knew I'd found it."

We remember because: Built in 1954 when Hamm's took over beer production at the Rainier plant, the glass "beer" on top of the sign was a state-of-the-art 3-D marvel. It was 13 feet high and had an 18-foot diameter, with rings of neon that made the giant goblet look as if it were filling and emptying with beer. (Complete with a foamy head!) The sign was removed when Hamm's closed the brewery.
"I think the challenge is that you can never completely eliminate incidents like this from happening on the battlefield," Jacobson said. "You can only reduce the likelihood that they take place." He said the horrors of war sometimes lead to such behavior by soldiers.

There isn't a lot of science behind the widely held assumption that venting your anger makes you feel better, Ballard added: It can actually perpetuate those emotions. Responding to aggravations with humor, however, definitely can help folks cope.
Aaaaaand ... Sherri and Val are going home! I'm honestly surprised it wasn't Roshon, I would've thought Sherri had the bigger fan base between the two of them. Then again, Sherri had a 21 and Roshon had a 26 last night, and with the way DWTS weights the scores from the judges, 5 points is a BIG deal. What's slightly surprising about these results is that Gladys, with only a 20 last night, has enough fans to keep her not just ahead of Sherri, but also to beat out Roshon with his much higher score. Interesting.
The Will County suspects whose federal warrants were dismissed include Antonio Sandoval, who fled to Mexico after he was charged in 1993 with fatally shooting a Joliet bar patron in the face, and Jose Cardenas, who was accused of molesting his daughter and then absconding with her across the Rio Grande border.
But Sheriff Tom Dart has another idea. If streamlining is the true goal, he tells us, why not have the sheriff's office assume policing duties in suburbs rather than retreat. There are more than 100 municipalities in Cook County, most with their own police forces. That's a lot of bureaucracy, Dart said.

The Bears bolstered their pass rush in the first round with defensive end Shea McClellin, who should start opposite Julius Peppers.

Blend it together well, and you have a green smoothie, but you won't taste the greens. The sweetness of the fruit is what comes through. (If it's not sweet enough for you, add a little honey or raw agave syrup). Just like that, I've added a full cup of greens and veggies, getting me closer to those nine a day we're all supposed to eat. And it keeps me from hitting the vending machine in late afternoon. At least one of my newsroom friends was so jazzed by my green smoothie she started making her own.
Sometimes the toughest challenge for a singer like Florence Welch is to learn how to wield the kind of pulmonary power that can make the heavens quake. On Florence + the Machine's 2009 debut, the fittingly named "Lungs," the flame-haired countess of theatrical art-pop voraciously tore into songs with her throaty wail. In wide-screen vistas like "Dog Days Are Over," Welch would chew scenery while the Machine valiantly toiled to get a musical word in edgewise. For all her prodigious talent, it sometimes didn't seem Welch was listening to the very song she was singing, she was so busy filling it with noise.

The episodes demonstrate that the United States remains the nation that Chinese dissidents and supporters of democratic reforms look to for support for their cause.

There was even a diehard Jets fan from Indianapolis with the team logo tattooed in bright green onto the back of his head. It seems that in many places, New York teams have absolutely transcended regionalism, the Super Bowl a way for them to celebrate football in general, and, via jerseys, T-shirts and hats, the notion that they're not just part of the Colts crowd.

* Albert Pujols is batting .216, and people are starting to make excuses for him. One of the things I read and hear is this: well, Albert has switched leagues. He needs to adjust to pitchers he hasn't seen before. It takes time ... Oh, really? No sale. As a Cardinal, Pujols had 541 at-bats against American League teams in Interleague play. And this is what he did: .348 batting average, 39 homers, 121 RBIs, and a 1.070 onbase-slugging pct. He crushed AL pitchers for 11 years, and now he's helpless because he hasn't seen much of them before? Ridiculous. Before Sunday's game at Cleveland, Pujols had a career batting average of .357 against Indians starter Derek Lowe, who had been in the NL for a long time. Pujols went 0 for 3 against Lowe yesterday. Why? Because Lowe was wearing the uniform of an AL team? Nah.

Arborists are the horticultural professionals, or even horticultural "physicians," who work specifically with trees. In fact, they had historically been known as tree surgeons because they perform what might be considered to be surgery on trees. After nurserymen grow trees in nurseries and landscapers install trees in landscapes, arborists take over to care for the same trees the way gardeners take care of landscapes below the trees.
