3B MIKE SCHMIDT*: One of the most detailed rebukes I received about the 10-greatest list in Sunday's paper had to do with Schmidt. Rather, had to ... inconceivably ... do with Schmidt. The dude hit more homers than any other player in the 1980s, won 10 Gold Gloves, and is one of only two players to win three MVPs while playing entirely on the defensively demanding left side of the infield. Yet, according to one email I would have been better choosing Terry Pendleton, Ozzie Galarraga or, yep, Nick Stavinoha for the list ahead of Schmidt. I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that even Dr. Thunder would acknowledge Schmidt edges him in a few significant categories. (Stavinoha, it should be noted, has a .272 average and a .444 slugging percentage as a pinch hitter, dwarfing Schmidt's woeful .204 and .327, respectively.) If someone can explain to me why Schmidt is a bad pick here, please the floor is yours ... He'll hold this spot for a few more years, I figure. Other candidates: Brooks Robinson, Wade Boggs, George Brett. Active candidates: Alex Rodriguez, Chipper Jones.

The Cardinals' third baseman got ahead in the count 2-0. He took a hack at a pitch to make it 2-1, and then took a strike for 2-2. Johnson left a pitch up and Freese jumped it for a line drive over the head of shortstop Jose Reyes. Berkman scored standing up, but the throw home allowed Freese to take second base, where he was stranded.
They "have clearly spoken and overwhelmingly want the Cardinals on KMOX and we do believe, as long as we can strike a win-win deal, in giving our listeners what they want,'' he said.

"The way we have to play as a team makes you rely on each other," Hitchcock said. "We can't do it by ourselves; we can't rely on one guy. Our top scorer (Backes) is our top checker, so it's a different element here. That's why when I say the buy-in is there, the buy-in is because everybody … not out of fear but out of having to trust each other so much … we play the right way. And everybody is on that page and almost afraid to get off. ... That relying on each other kept the stress and the pressure away.

For "Some Nights," Ruess' agenda was to pull back on the complex sound effects, horn sections and, yes, gospel choirs he'd masterminded for "Aim and Ignite." He hit the right balance — "Some Nights," "It Gets Better" and "Carry On" are big and broad, like Queen or Styx, with an emphasis on chorus and hooks rather than studio tricks and sonic clutter. "With this album, we try to take a 'less is more' approach," Ruess says. "I do the French horn in 'We Are Young' — I don't think you can hear it, but it's there. But I didn't want to be as crazy as maybe I had in the past. With this album, I tried to be more to the point."

Ultimately, it was La Palma Mexicatessen's mouthwatering tortillas (which Julieta Cifuentes is making, above) and huaraches that won our hearts. Established in 1953, La Palma offers a variety of Mexican and Central American ingredients and prepared foods, including freshly made salsas and succulent carnitas that can be purchased by the pound.

It doesn't have to be this way.
Although states may initially object to the policy, past precedents have proved that tying financial incentives to state policies can be quite persuasive. The threat of withholding federal highway funding prompted all 50 states to adjust their legal drinking age, and the threat of withholding federal funds for health care would likely have the same effect on vaccination policy.
In this case, the revelry sparked by enterprising business owners could cause officials to curtail the tradition.

It is a concept that has the trappings of Eastern religious mysticism, but it is really no more mysterious than cause and effect. Karma is no more profound than the eternal insightfulness of the Golden Rule. It can be summed up as "You reap what you sow," a tenet succinctly expressed by St. Paul, writing to the Galatians.
“Lewton didn’t believe in showing violence or blood on screen, everything was suspense. Kracauer said if you’re going to make a fantasy, ground it in reality. Don’t gussy it up. So when I made ‘The Wednesday Children,’ there was no blood, no on-screen violence. It’s all implied.”
Unfortunately, sticking it to everyday Floridians is the new status quo.
“We've found ways to win games, which we did a lot last year,” Girardi said. “I don't think we've pitched as well as we've been capable of. I think our bullpen has been outstanding. I think we scored runs. But I think in look forward we have to improve in our starting pitching. I think the talent is in the room. It just needs to get better.”

The intervening years have proven that my fears were not "exaggerated." I don't expect my critics to now publicly admit they were wrong. I can only echo a recent president who, in an entirely different context, said: "Bring it on!"

She said the public retirement system is a contractual relationship between the state and its employees per the state Constitution and Arizona law forbids legislation "impairing the obligation of a contract." Under Willett's ruling, lawmakers could change the retirement system to impact only new employees. The state has 30 days from when Willett filed her written judgment on April 17 to file an appeal. But that appears unlikely.

With 18.2 seconds left in a San Antonio-Phoenix playoff game in 2007, the Spurs were down three and had to foul. Horry went too far, however, using his forearm to send Nash flying into the lower part of the scorer's table. Horry walked away like nothing happened, and Nash - who was running at close to full speed when he was sent airborne - eventually got up as players from both teams pushed and shoved a bit more after the play.

An idea is born: In the early 1990s Kushins vacationed in Washington, D.C., with his children, staying at a home he found through a Europe-based home exchange program. "It was perfect," he recalled.

They had a swimming pool, and everyone had their own room and their own TV." Impressed, he decided to launch his own home exchange business in the U.S.

The Sabols can laugh about it now sitting atop a 208,000 square-foot empire known as NFL Films. The days of projecting their movies off bedsheets at Kiwanis Club luncheons, VFW Posts and Cub Scout gatherings as a form of guerilla marketing have long passed. So has the struggle to sell Sabol’s idea that a football game was as much a dazzling Hollywood narrative as a competition.

Prices at first made me gasp: $48 for a 1-pound dry-aged New York strip; $34 for double-cut lamb chops; and $27 for a line-caught Alaskan halibut fillet. Side dishes like a loose corn custard and hand-cut frites cost $9 to $12. The only appetizer under $10 is a classic Bibb and butter lettuce salad with mustard vinaigrette. That means an average meal with tax, tip and a modest bottle of wine can cost more than $100 a person.
øA: I can't agree with that. The leaders in the world are American companies. There are other companies in other parts of the world that are innovating, but we're still the envy of the world when it comes to medical technology. Things like the magnetic resonance imagers and the CT scanners, a lot of those are being developed and made in the U.S. I don't think we've lost our luster.

Like other registered dietitians who work with the Corn Refiners, Atlanta-based Carolyn O'Neil says, "All added sugars should be consumed in moderation -- corn sugar, table sugar, honey and fruit juice concentrates."

Courtesy of a 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder, the Regal GS packs some heat, but it's more chipotle than habanero. Endemic of yesteryear's pint-sized turbo engines, the GS pulls hard only as the tach needle swings past 3,000 rpm. Some of today's best engines, like the Audi A4 and BMW's 2012 328i, have plenty of gusto right off the line. Buick claims a hardy 295 pounds-feet of torque at 2,400 rpm, the sort of low-end push that ought to pin you back in your seat. I felt no such excitement, but I do give kudos to the six-speed manual transmission, whose medium throws, precise gates and light clutch are worth spreading to other GM cars. A six-speed automatic will be a no-cost option.

The cottage was on the property when the couple bought it more than a year ago. To get permits, they couldn't change its footprint. So that means, within the 360 square feet, the family will live in a small living room with a pull-out couch and an efficient kitchen along the far wall, a bedroom that barely fits a queen-size bed, a bathroom with a shower and a closet converted to a desk area.
GAMER YOU'VE GOT THE READ: Leave it to a lefty with a big looping curveball and an awful spring training to conquer Coors Field and become the first San Francisco Giants pitcher in 18 years to throw a shutout a mile above sea level.

Some of the devices in "The Notting Hill Mystery" — mesmerism, for instance, and a kidnapping band of gypsies — would raises eyebrows among today's crime fans. But on the whole, the mystery that started them all is as masterful as anything it inspired.
In fairness, a Statehouse majority's preening arrogance isn't exactly new (20-year Democratic House Speaker Vern Riffe made it clear who ran the place). But this session, Republicans seem be taking it to a new level. And the curse of General Assembly term limits means legislators aren't in office long enough to learn a lesson that history has taught time and again about Ohio politics:

It proved successful and today is a signature attraction for residents and visitors while still serving its original purpose of controlling floodwaters when the need arises.
The match between Jericho and Sheamus was a really strong television main event and made both world title challengers look strong. They had a good amount of time to work before Jericho won via countout, albeit with an assist from Bryan.

My colleague Jonah Goldberg wrote the other day about Chris Mooney, author of "The Republican Brain," and other scientific chaps who argue that conservatives suffer from a genetic cognitive impairment that causes us to favor small government. In other words, we're born stupid.

"My 10-year-old is after me. He no longer wants a Porsche. He wants Dad to have an 'S' sedan." Pete sounds so out of it, you have to wonder if maybe he's 1/32nd Republican on his great-great-great-grandmother's side.

Airlines’ cost of using Hartsfield-Jackson will climb from about $4.50 per boarded passenger last year to $6 next year, based on lease payments, landing fees and other airport costs divided by passengers.

On the other hand, those costs can be offset by more efficient airport operations and expanded business, which is why airlines often support new facilities or additional runways.
Hey kids, don't let your teachers tell you this is an honest mistake. In fact, it's a whopper. The postcards are the OEA's bald and deliberate attempt at guilt by association. "Vote No on Bill Sizemore's Measures" the postcard reads, and then says, "No on 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65."

In long-standing Nashville tradition, he favors concrete particulars over allusions and metaphors.

Hot 97’s annual hip-hop and R&B party returns to the Meadowlands with its usual impeccable timing. Anticipation for “Thank Me Later” — pop-rapper Drake’s full-length debut, due out June 15 — ought to be feverish. Naturally, he is one of Summer Jam’s headliners this year.

Or they could just wait for the inevitable surprise performances, which are as much a part of the Summer Jam experience as the shout-outs to the host radio station.

No longer would they have to wander from agent to agent (or website to website) to find out what their options were. Nor would they have to try to translate each insurer's fine print to measure the total value of its policies. Enabling consumers to compare services and prices should remove some of the artificial barriers to competition in insurance and make it harder for companies to raise premiums.

However, it should be noted that a well-positioned toll system might, in time, actually provide funding for infrastructure improvements and mass transit initiatives aimed at easing congestion.
