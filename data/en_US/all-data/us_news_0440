This I can identify with. As a woman divorced for seven years, I've lived a celibate life. A lot of people think I'm crazy or repressed, and they let me know it. By the way, I don't think for a minute I'm beyond falling into what I would consider sin here. But while not easy, and, yes, at times I've whined about it, for starters, this path has allowed me to see myself as more than just a sexual being. It also has protected my heart and allowed me to think clearly about relationships I've been in. If I never remarry, I believe that abstinence will remain my calling, yet it will still be possible to live a whole life in the midst of it.

Private insurance industry costs are rising nearly twice as fast as those of Medicare. And when it comes to administrative expenses, private insurance is 10 times higher than Medicare. In fact, if the single payer financing of Medicare were applied to citizens of all ages, we would save $350 billion annually, more than enough to provide comprehensive health care to every American.

They did complain about the size of the showers, and she thought the Britannia Room cuisine just didn't have "that wow factor."

Meryl Streep's silhouette isn't bad, though if she's going with the long, lean, belted looked, we prefer the one she sported at the Golden Globes. But that is the same wallpaper pattern our mother considered when remodeling our kitchen in 1983. And the fabric reads like a poly-blend. Ugh.

WHAT HAPPENED: Rick Porcello couldnt keep his sinker down consistently enough and paid for it by giving up four early runs. All that action sent his pitch count up, which prevented Porcello from pitching past the 5th inning. This forced Jim Leyland to go to his bullpen. And the bullpen hasnt been sharp lately. The As took advantage and tacked on seven more runs. The Tigers, meanwhile, managed just five hits and two runs through the first seven innings. A late two-run effort in the 8th belied the offensive struggles.

What, then are my reservations? This same career timeline leads me to wonder if Mr. Dance has had adequate experience to effectively lead a complex school system such as Baltimore County. Mr. Dance was a school teacher for only 2 years. He would not even qualify for tenure in as a teacher in the state of Maryland. Further, such a short teaching career would indicate that he lacks experience in teaching at the various educational levels (elementary, middle and high school) and areas (general education, special education, the arts, etc.).

There are moments in our kid's lives, however, that are true kairos moments-times when something spectacular breaks through. Time in the ancient Greek world was expressed with two words: "kairos," and "chronos." The former was used to describe every day, moment-by-moment experiences. But "kairos" expressed a moment of rare opportunity. Kairos moments are those times when everything meshes together in amazing synchronicity. Sunday afternoon was one of those moments for our family. It was a moment of profound spiritual insight.
"(Richardson) has lateral agility like very few guys in the 230-pound range. You give him a crease, and he can take it. He can go. He also is catching the ball, I think, naturally. He can make double moves in the open field and make things happen as a receiver after the catch. He's improved in pass protection.
Gomez's hip strain was called "mild." Acta was supposed to pick a fifth starter today with Gomez and Kevin Slowey being his only choices after Huff went down Thursday.

THE FACTS: No one can know what would have happened absent the bailout. But it's a distinctly minority view that the private sector, raked then by the financial crisis, would have nursed Detroit back to health without a massive infusion of federal aid. In late 2008, banks weren't making many loans, much less to companies that were out of cash. The Bush administration moved fast because it saw no time to let an orderly bankruptcy unfold, even if banks had the money and the will to steer automakers through the process.

Perhaps that's a loophole large enough to accommodate Zimmerman's actions. But perhaps not. Trayvon's family and the public deserve to know how a trip to the candy store could come to such a horrific end.
Patterson is a master at execution, always letting the main ingredient shine. A sea scallop sashimi with Meyer lemon, olive oil, salt, avocado and radish, for example, is a combination in which all the elements are crucial background notes that elevate the creamy salinity of the seafood.

At one extreme, one can fight to the death like a trapped rat; at the other, one can offer only token resistance. Not long ago, I thought most conservatives would have employed the trapped-rat option at the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency.

“We’re doing our best as a coaching staff to keep them in line,” he said. “We basically told them to have a short memory. You’ve got to move on. The only way the bleeding is going to stop is that we work harder in practice and we believe. We have to believe in ourselves and the guy next to us and make sure that we raise the bar and keep everybody on board. Practices have to keep being enthusiastic and full of high energy. Obviously, that starts with the coaching staff to make sure that we promote that.”
The interior of Wexler's, too, looks about as far away from a barbecue shack as you can get. The restaurant is located in a handsome brick Financial District firehouse that previously housed Zare and Les Amis. A long black sculptural installation glides down the center of the ceiling, exiting above the doors and serving as a canopy for the entrance. It's meant to evoke the waves of black smoke, but to me it looks more like the charred spine of a brontosaurus, which isn't a bad image, either.

Of course, the representative of the American Petroleum Institute would promote a tar sands oil pipeline from Canada to the U.S. ("Keystone XL pipeline is a step toward the future," Aug. 25).

I think this hopefully solidifies us as a team that can be a playoff team, No. 1. And be a really tough out in the playoffs. It’s too hard to project where you are going to be because you have a lot of variables you can’t predict. Obviously, as we’ve seen with our team, injuries (happen). But I think if we’re healthy, we’re going to be a pretty tough team come playoff time. ... I go back to the grittiness and toughness of a lot of our players. (That) is going to help through that grind this year. I feel really good about our team. I know Nate does as well.

Brad: I remember reading on Gateway Guide's website (quite some time ago) that ramp metering would be going into place throughout the St. Louis area.

Just curious, as I know it helps traffic in other cities.

Most people do not fully understand trillion-dollar deficits, the national debt, or what the debt ceiling is, so let's be clear on what we are talking about. There are structural imbalances in government operations that have resulted in the U.S. government spending far more than it takes in from tax revenues. Contrary to what some partisans claim, these deficits did not suddenly appear during the Obama administration; they have been a part of U.S. government finances since World War II. Over the last several decades, to cover the cash shortfalls, the government has borrowed a total of $14.3 trillion through the sale of U.S. Treasury bonds. Individuals and institutions buy the bonds and then earn interest on what they believe are safe investments backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. The government uses the cash to pay its bills.

Any project that is dependent upon revenue generated by new hotels needs to acknowledge that the current financing market for hotels is extremely weak. Hotels long-planned for other parts of the Unified Port District, such as at Lane Field, have not been built precisely due to a lack of financing available following the economic downturn. That is particularly true for higher-end properties. Any plan that relies on new hotels, especially full-service hotels with higher room rates than limited-service properties, needs to be realistic and conservative in its estimates.

The 2012 season is only five days old and already the Cardinals have had two three-homer innings. On Friday, Carlos Beltran, Matt Holliday, and David Freese tattooed Brewers ace Yovani Gallardo with three homers and four runs in the third inning of a game at Miller Park. On Monday, Matt Holliday, David Freese, and then Molina blistered Cincinnati Reds starter Homer Bailey with three homers and four runs in the first inning.

Management settled the cases for a $280 million payment made on Jan. 2, 1991. Among the players affected: Jack Morris, Andre Dawson, Tim Raines, Jack Clark, Lance Parrish.
Fines might dip under Christie as the DEP allows more polluters to undertake an alternative approach known as "environmental projects," rather than pay fines, Skacel said. The projects cost polluters as much, if not more, than fines and often yield better results, he said.
But during Tuesday's argument, JusticeAnthony M. Kennedyand the court's liberal justices said they were most troubled by the mandatory life terms given to very young criminals. Maybe such a long term could be justified in some cases, but it "cannot be mandatory," Kennedy said.

Albert Florence was searched twice in seven days after he was arrested on a warrant for a traffic fine he had already paid. The justices will review an appeals court decision upholding the searches.
Emergency response, of course, also is crucial. That requires mapping where the biggest problems are more likely to arise and developing detailed plans to provide power, shelter, food, potable water, transportation and medical care. Homeowners should: secure objects such as water heaters and heavy bookshelves that pose special hazards, develop a family communication plan, put aside emergency supplies of food and water and learn that in an earthquake, the safest refuge usually is inside a building under a sturdy piece of furniture.

Saturday was open only to the media, but Sunday the fans will arrive, with all the barking and woofing and brown-and-orange expectations of a fan base starved for victory. Fans love the polite, aw-shucks demeanor of McCoy. They buy into the plucky underdog aspects of his narrative of this third-round draft pick making good.
Gezari and her colleagues used two telescopes — one in Hawaii that detected visible light and another perched in orbit that sensed ultraviolet radiation — to scan the sky for possible tidal disruptions, which appear as bright flashes that slowly fade away.
Radomski went on to indicate that some things in the book are exaggerated or overdramatized because he was told he needed nuggets that "would sound good." He said the book was dictated to a writer in a series of interviews, not under oath as he was in the courtroom. He added that he also didn't like the book's cover, which depicts a bottle of pills inside a baseball glove.

Start with Ocean Grove native John “Southside Johnny” Lyon’s bluesy vocals and harmonica playing and sardonic, no-nonsense stage persona, add a driving rhythm section, some fiery guitar riffs and a boisterous horn section, and you have the gist of the Jukes’ sound.

Monica decides to do something audacious. She spies on her mother's lover, following him to his place of work, a little shop that buys and sells antique maps (hidden routes and signposts are another Big Symbol). Faster than you can say "huge mistake," she befriends the man, a charming and worldly Mexican expatriate named Victor (Joseph Melendez), and insinuates herself into his life.

"If the unions had been amenable to doing that, then I would have supported looking for an outside analysis," Barrera said. "I don't put any stock in Keenan, who wants a contract, to tell us how much money they are going to save us."
In a metal or disposable pie pan, toss the tomatoes with the red onion, garlic, olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Place the pan on the medium part of the grill and cover the grill, stirring occasionally and cooking until the skins burst and tomatoes soften, about 10 minutes. About halfway through cooking time, place the chops on the hotter part of the grill for about 6 minutes, flipping once after 3 minutes. Transfer the chops to a serving platter and loosely cover.

The American people did not choose this fight. It came to our shores, and started with the senseless slaughter of our citizens. After nearly 10 years of service, struggle, and sacrifice, we know well the costs of war. These efforts weigh on me every time I, as Commander-in-Chief, have to sign a letter to a family that has lost a loved one, or look into the eyes of a service member who’s been gravely wounded.
On the first day of filming "Évocateur" in 2009, six former "loudmouths" reunited on the now-vacant Secaucus set and talked about the issues that unsettled them most as teens. On the late-'80s program, one had trashed Donald Trump, one railed against Japan and another mocked a guest who believed Elvis Presley was still alive.
We are seeing an increase in decay rates in children ages 2 to 5. That group is getting more decay than the older kids. We see more than 50% of those kids having decay. The 6-12 age range has had a decrease in their decay rates as well as those in the 12-16 year age group.

It's a different world once the bike gets moving. All of the challenges of everyday life  with eating and getting dressed and figuring out how to express oneself the easiest and best way  are behind them.

NBA Commissioner David Stern has spent six years putting together the pieces and the people (AEG, Steinberg, Johnson, Maloofs, NBA lawyers) and overseeing the arena venture at the Maloofs' request. While owners tend to side with owners, at least publicly, the existence of a tentative agreement in Sacramento figures to prod at least some owners into pressing the Maloofs toward a deal.

In the recipe for Garlic & Rosemary Lamb Chops (see recipe, page F6), for example, grill-roasting the tomatoes imparts smoky nuances you won't get by roasting them in a regular oven. Because the tomatoes cook in a metal pan right over the fire, simply cover the grill, and let the heat do the work.

Currently, only one statin drug, pravastatin, is approved for use in children as young as 8. Many pediatricians are cautious about using such drugs because evidence of their safety when taken over an extended period of time has not been proved.
Since 1995, one of the initiatives of the laboratory has been the discovery of mutations that wipe out the body's normal ability to keep colon cancer from forming. Research conveyed that more than one-third of human colorectal cancers showed mutations in a particular gene, called TGF-beta Receptor 2 (RII). One role of RII is to turn on another gene, named 15-PGDH, which in turn keeps tumors in the colon from forming. Similar to a domino effect, when RII does not work properly, 15-PGDH is not present. This is now believed to be one key cause of colon cancer.

It's easy to imagine Mendoza fearing that the sticker would become such a huge problem that it was better to put an end to it before someone from "the crowd" called for her to step down. I guess she wasn't worried about enraging the crowd of 18,000 Chicagoans who voted for the design.

Which highlights Romney's deeper problem. His campaign is very good at tactics. It has taken each challenger, found his weakness and pounded it home. But Romney's candidacy remains short on aspiration. His public appeal, at this point, is a combination of emphasizing his business experience, criticizing Obama's record and reassuring conservatives. This is a campaign – but not a cause.

A: Hey, Scott: It was Gilbert's opinion that Brown did not get the most out of his team over the past two years in the playoffs, and that was the central reason he decided to make a change. Though, yes, James did play a role. James and his camp actually wanted Brown fired a year earlier but, contrary to public opinion, Gilbert did not give in to everything James wanted. Even if James was under contract for longer, Brown likely would have been fired. Ferry did not leave because Brown was fired directly but because his contract was up and Gilbert wasn't prepared to guarantee him the same amount of control he had with his last deal. Had Ferry's contract not been up and control been up for discussion, Ferry may have stayed.

One of the largest waves of immigration in our history took place little more than a century ago. At the time, Jewish people were being driven out of Eastern Europe, often escaping to the sounds of gunfire and the light from their villages burning to the ground. The journey could take months, as families crossed rivers in the dead of night, traveled miles by foot, endured a rough and dangerous passage over the North Atlantic. Once here, many made their homes in a teeming and bustling Lower Manhattan.

"Midway through the baseball season I had to quit because it got to be too much. I wasn't a bad baseball player though. I hit the ball pretty good. I tell that to all my grandkids now. I tell them I was great. I never back down. I exaggerate to all heck just trying to motivate them."
Cabezon, a surprising fish story of a restaurant gleaming in Rose Park City, is itself pretty unexpected. Tucked into two cozy storefronts just off Northeast 52nd and Sandy -- with some outdoor tables if summer ever shows up -- it sets out chive blinis with trout caviar, cioppino, and lavender and honey crème brulée, while retaining the kind of warmth of a neighborhood place specializing in pickles to go with the Pabst.
COST offers graduate students a challenging education that is research-based and technology-infused, and promotes lifelong learning and stewardship for the benefit of the human, natural and technological resources of Georgia, the nation and the world.

The book is powerfully illustrated, beginning with the assassination and ending with the death, in 1926, of Robert Todd Lincoln, the president's surviving son. To leaf through its pages is to walk through the life of the nation after that night at Ford's Theater in 1865, watching as a man became a legend. To remember Lincoln, the Kunhardts demonstrate, is to remember ourselves -- for better and occasionally for worse. (The lone speech by a black man at the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial, we learn from "Looking for Lincoln," went largely unreported.)

Nothing gets an urban mom's juice-box flowing like a good playground. In a town where houses on flat streets with wide sidewalks and large grassy backyards are about as common as getting into your first choice of public school, a great neighborhood playground is worth far more than its weight in sand. It's a lifesaver. A play date without the phone calls. A built-in coffee klatch. The court of last resort for the boundless-energy set. Mother's Little Helper minus the hangover.

The economists at Bank of America think new purchases would have "only a modest impact on the economy" but are "better than doing nothing." A plausible program might cut the unemployment rate by 0.2 percentage points (say, from 9.6 percent to 9.4 percent), says Moody's Analytics. The stock market would be slightly stronger, leading people to spend more, and a depreciated dollar would aid exports. Indeed, because Bernanke and other Fed officials have signaled a new round of bond buying, financial markets may already reflect some of these effects. This makes it harder for the Fed not to vindicate these widespread expectations.

The court essentially ruled that states must educate all children unless a state can show a substantial negative impact. Some believe that documenting a state's financial impact from educating illegal immigrants could prove a substantial state interest.
