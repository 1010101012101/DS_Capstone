He came in in phenomenal shape, he's hands were good and unfortunately he got hurt.

Jonas has often talked about his admiration of Costello, and was apparently inspired to sing this anthem of lust by Costello's performance of it in the 2004 Porter biopic, "De-Lovely."

It is getting used, more so than it was before we made the shift. I still don't think it's, you know, it's not a substantial percentage of our guests showing up on bicycles, but that wasn't the intent anyway. The intent with Burgerville always is that everybody is at the table. So whenever we run in to a situation of someone's excluded we want to make the effort to make sure that they're there.

Driving a lot of the noise on any issues is something called "search engine optimization," which means using as many words as possible in a story so that it will be picked up by the automated eyeballs of Google and Yahoo! (their exclamation point, not mine). Any time you can have the words "Al Qaeda" and "genitals" in the same story, you've got a goldmine. That leads to more of the same – an echochamber of hyperlinks. Talk radio, always ready to hit the hot button, jumped in to bloviate non-stop against TSA. TV and newspapers followed their leads.

All these symptoms could be caused by a hyperactive thyroid, however, they might signal some other condition the veterinarian should check for. In some cases, the hyperactive dog will have a personality change, going from a happy, well-adjusted dog to an asocial animal. The veterinarian will look for excessive secretions of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which results in signs that reflect an increased metabolic rate. The doctor also will check the dog’s heartbeat for murmurs or congestive heart failure.

The Parker system captures energy normally lost when the vehicles brake and stores that in compressed hydraulic fluid. When the driver hits the accelerator pedal, the system releases the compressed fluid, launching the vehicle from its stopped position. The diesel engine then moves the trucks at higher speeds.
Another covetous complainer, disparaging "absurdly ridiculous" sports salaries, argued that Manning's salary could, instead, have gone to pay for school buses, textbooks, free lunches, teachers' pay and other societal needs. In fact, the degree of our compassion and commitment to governmental largess on such items is already measured by $15 trillion of federal debt and more than $100 trillion in unfunded government liabilities.

Precedent does exist for the admittance of fMRI scans in court. In 2005, the Supreme Court admitted fMRI evidence in Roper vs. Simmons, a case involving a minor on death row, to help establish that an adolescent brain works differently than an adult one.

The back-story: I help run a global warming campaign called 350.org. In midsummer, we organized an effort to urge world leaders to put solar panels on the roofs of their residences. It was part of the lead-up to a gigantic Global Work Party on Oct. 10 (10-10-10), and a way to give prime ministers and politburos something easy and visible to do in the fight against global warming. One of those crucial leaders is, of course, Barack Obama.
And not just on the car rental company's part. As you say, you should have photographed the truck, both before and after the rental. Use the digital camera on your phone or shoot video, but whatever you do, get some evidence of pre-existing damage or of the fact that you returned the car in good condition.
But Senate Majority Leader John Morse withdrew the amendment after Senate Republicans — already angry over how the inactive voter measure has moved through the legislature — called it a "heavy-handed political ploy" and a "slick move."

Trade agreements are good for Oregon exporters because they eliminate tariffs that U.S. exporters pay as they enter foreign markets. For example, in 2003, Chile signed a trade agreement with South Korea, and their market share for wine grew from 2 percent to 23 percent. U.S. winegrowers still pay an average tariff of 15 percent on wine exports to South Korea and are priced out of most of the market. This trade agreement with South Korea would eliminate this tariff, opening new markets for Oregon winegrowers.

These elements help capture the loneliness and melancholy that were an important part of who Jackson was.

But not quite. There is something decidedly unusual about Cassidy and his situation. He demands to see Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks), a police negotiator with a checkered past. Which, it turns out, Cassidy has, too. As Leth goes back and forth in time, we learn that Cassidy is a disgraced police officer himself, in prison for -- of course -- a crime he did not commit. Movie prisons are full of such people; in Cassidy's case, he was convicted of stealing a diamond from all-around-jerk and rich guy David Englander (Ed Harris, chewing scenery like he's famished).

But the filmmaker is concerned with more than just Matt's immediate family or his immediate problems. It delves into the notion of legacies — the good and bad that we inherit, the love and hate we leave behind.

The state Attorney General’s Office joined the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office in opposing the appeal regarding only the video playback aspect.

U.S. and international locales continue rolling out ever-more enticing incentive packages, so Mexico's ability to attract film shoots faces serious challenges.

The storm was expected to smack into land near Tulum, a beach town of eco-resorts and cliffside Mayan ruins, and then quickly weaken into a tropical depression before heading back out over the Gulf of Mexico, where it could turn into a hurricane by the end of the week.
We'll probably find out soon enough that this was the lowest-rated Academy Awards in, well, not 78 years, but in some time. But that will have more to do with the niche -- some might say polarizing -- nature of the nominated films than with the actual telecast.
For more than a year, the 43-year-old Democrat has ignored a statewide chorus of calls to resign, despite raucous protests outside his home and pressure from then-Gov. Jon Corzine. Last month, the mayor narrowly survived a contentious recall election, clinging to office by just 29 votes.

Four neighboring houses also were damaged, the fire department said. Tim Lash, who lives next door, said the siding on his home was completely melted away from the intensity of the flames.
Naturally, personal taste enters the equation a great deal, too. James admires Ian Rankin for daring to retire his police detective protagonist, John Rebus, when most authors -- herself included -- can't bear to age their fictional constructs in real time. Sara Paretsky is "the most remarkable of the moderns," which indicates taste as much as who James considers to be a contemporary detective novelist (Paretsky began her career nearly three decades ago). But James also believes that current economic and societal uncertainty creates enough grist for the mill to concoct a "New Golden Age" of detective fiction -- that both reflects society and provides comfort and escapism for those who need it most.
The Commonwealth office spans four floors and about 27,000 square feet and is already home to between 160 and 180 workers, said Todd Grantham, associate partner and Goodbys managing director for Detroit.
Debbie Hines isn't so sure that's a good thing. In the immaculate living room of her home, Debbie, who has never spoken publicly about Kevin, says: "Initially, I thought it was probably a good thing. But I also said to Kevin, 'You've gotten to this point and done some good things. But it's time to move on. I wouldn't want you to make a career out of it. Because if you jumped off the bridge at 19, and are still talking about it at 45, and that's all you're doing, I'm not thinking that's a great success.' "

Those who oppose the law actually argued before the justices Tuesday that Congress under its commerce power could require individuals to buy insurance at the point they ask a doctor or hospital for medical care  but not in advance. Isn't that still a mandate? In any case, no insurance system, which aims to pool risks, could possibly work that way. These people are not serious.

Mu Sigma's founder and CEO, Dhiraj Rajaram, extols the company's geekiness, saying his aim is to build the world's largest applied-mathematics company.

Not even if it turns out they want the menu within a week -- there's a promotional newsletter to print -- and not even if the only time he can do it is right after another cooking display he's booked himself, in Copenhagen, featuring 10 mostly European culinary comers. By this afternoon, Lightner has at least been in New York more than 48 hours, and he's gotten some sleep, but he's still trying to deal with more time zones than courses.

That's not to diminish the hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity Oriole Park has provided the downtown. Combined with other hotel, meeting and entertainment venues, the downtown tourism scene continues to thrive and now extends to Inner Harbor East and beyond.

When we arrived in Hawaii, we'd found two almost-new boogie boards standing by a garbage can discarded by departing tourists. The day we left, we passed them on to another family. After all, why not help someone else save a few bucks?
Does anyone, anywhere, believe that if the widespread violence that is an everyday occurrence on the South Side of Chicago was happening in Lake Forest, or Barrington, or Park Ridge, that the Tribune would so cavalierly report the weekend killings every Monday morning without calling for immediate and significant intervention by the powers-that-be? If it were Barrington, the National Guard would be called out by Gov. Pat Quinn. If it were Park Ridge, political leaders would be meeting in emergency session.

We discovered that the study subjects who anticipated pride at resisting the cake consumed far less than those who focused on the shame of succumbing. They also ate less than the control group.

There is a serious and acute problem for rhinos due to a spike in demand, mostly from Asian markets. However, many rhino populations are relatively well protected due to the efforts conservationists in East and Southern Africa. While some elephant and ape populations benefit from good protection, most populations are highly vulnerable, and we are seeing that the growing demand for ivory, and the ease by which it can be smuggled in large quantities, is resulting in the current, massive wave of elephant poaching. The threat to apes in Africa is more chronic, but their populations are smaller and usually in once-remote forests that are now being opened for logging and other extractive industries. Hippos have not received the attention they deserve in that they have experienced huge impacts in some places where large, concentrated populations are vulnerable to poaching. Their populations in many places have crashed with little attention of the international conservation community.

Last season: Peyton Manning's injury led to complete collapse and demonstrated how many flaws four-time league MVP covered up during career. Owner Jim Irsay made only decision he could, rebuilding from ground up.

McShane’s numbers are modest: He has nine points and three rebounds and four assists in the eight Pac-12 games. But his influence is apparent, and teammates readily admit they want to beat Oregon for obvious reasons and for McShane, in his last year.
Volkswagen Group of America has announced plans to add 800 jobs at its factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., to increase production of its hot-selling Passat sedan.
For those who do seek help and the loss is more severe, it can helpful to know that today's hearing aids are a marked improvement over the versions we may have seen our parents or grandparents struggle with years ago. Noble said some models are Bluetooth enabled and can transmit a cell phone conversation, music from an iPod or the audio from a television show directly to the hearing aid. She added that hearing aids now have computer chips that can have as many as 20 channels; this means hearing aids can be fine tuned for each individual in a way that was difficult to achieve before.

• David Wharton, LA Times: Could lame-duck coach tip the scales for UCLA against Ducks?: In October, UCLA faced California without six players, suspended after an on-field brawl and disheartening loss at Arizona. The team mustered one of its best performances, winning 31-14. Granted, Washington State and Cal are not exactly Oregon. But Cal Coach Jeff Tedford wonders if UCLA might get an emotional push in its final game under Neuheisel, who was fired on Monday. "Typically, those things are used as rallying cries," Tedford said. "It can bring a team together."

The curious part to all of this has been what appears to be a relatively loose locker room after two latest defeats. There have been easy conversations, laugh-out-loud moments, and what appears to be a general uninterest in the team's surprising struggles.
I just saw that you included your phone number as well, and for such enthusiasm, I should probably provide you with a further explanation, instead of being quite so coy. In my other letter to you, I said I was disheartened by the lack of support for the President. But perhaps more importantly, the lack of thorough, well-reasoned arguments that can be found on both sides of this issue. As I'm sure you've observed, Obama became quickly as polarizing has Hilary ever was, and few people can see past their emotions on the issue. Most public discourse includes terms like "Wingnut," "Drink the Kool-aid," "Socialist" and other far less polite terms. I get called "trash" and "Crypto-Stalinist," not only by the Sarah Palin fans, but by The Left, who is furious at The Prez for not opening up the health care debates to CSPAN cameras.

English filed the state's first Measure 37 claim, and was joined by 6,500 Oregonians who demanded either compensation for diminished property values or for the right to build, in many cases, extensive subdivisions. Local governments such as Multnomah County were given the choice of either paying or waiving development restrictions. With no money to pay millions in claims, counties and cities routinely chose the latter course.
This blow is not equal to losing Brian Wilson for the year, but it hurts because of Mota's versatility. He could pitch five innings if a starter got KOd early or pitch in short relief, as he did Saturday. That he allegedly prospered with artificial help does not make the void he leaves any smaller.

This is a regime of radicals motivated by Islamist revolutionary fever for hegemony in the Middle East and beyond. Some of them are inspired by millennial visions of the apocalyptic return of the 12th Mahdi. Holocaust denial is promoted. Wiping Israel off the map is advocated, as is chasing "the great Satan," the United States, out of the Middle East. International law is flouted with state-sanctioned mobs taking U.S. diplomats hostage in 1979 and last November ransacking the British embassy, and Iran plotting to kill the Saudi ambassador in Washington. Let's not forget Iran is the No. 1 state supporter of terrorism.

"In the end, the story of SB 1070 is the story of an arrogant, out-of-control federal government," Brewer writes in the book's opening pages. "We passed a law to protect ourselves because the federal government wouldn't. And what did we get for our effort? We were demonized and called racists.

Besides respect for women, I also hope to teach my kids that you can make up for your mistakes. I'd like to think that Letterman's penance won't include enforced and permanent silence. Yes, he messed up. And I think he realizes it. Let's not call for his head just because he is employed by a nervous corporation that has no tolerance for scandal. I, for one, hope that CBS gets creative and lets Letterman use his high profile to do something good for women's rights.

He and his winemaker, Matt Norelli, precisely struck that balance with the Preston of Dry Creek 2009 Dry Creek Valley Zinfandel. It's at once both a traditional Dry Creek Valley zinfandel  13 percent petite sirah was added to bring in a bit more color, spine and spice  and a modern interpretation, given that its bright raspberry and blackberry flavors run more to morning sunshine than afternoon. From the clarity of its color to the spiciness in its finish, this is one stunning zinfandel.

I fancy tomatoes, especially the kind with a little history behind them, the kind of history that reminds me of the days when it was enough to bite into one like a ripe apple and discover a rush of juice and supreme flavor.
The next day, police release a grainy surveillance image of the suspect and a plea for the public's help to crack the case. A description included clothing, and estimated height and weight.
"When we made the decision to go with an independent investigation, we lost that control because it's in the hands of a third party," said Keith Bromery, Atlanta school spokesman.

I've spent a couple of weeks playing with Schneider Optics' iPro lens kit and the Olloclip. They're both very good and worthy of a recommendation. They're just designed for two different kinds of photography.
So early that afternoon I drove to the store. Along the way, in kind of an iffy neighborhood, I saw a car at the side of the road with its hood up. There was a tall, gorgeous woman standing next to it alone, looking nervous. This was the dark ages before cell phones, and the young lady seemed very relieved when I stopped to help her.
"Frankly they are a mess," said Lucius T. Outlaw, a federal public defender representing Currie, referring to the disclosure forms. "I'm not going to say that is a good thing. … This is one more example of untimely, inaccurate and incomplete forms."

TV show you try to always catch?
What Meyers is good at, judging by past credits such as “Something’s Gotta Give,” is making feel-good comedies about attractive, upscale middle-aged people in love. This upsets some critics, who complain her films are full of unbelievable situations and simple wish-fulfillment.
"It's not clear yet how much time he'll miss. It will be a minimum of four weeks. Somewhere in the four to eight (range), depending on how he responds and how treatment goes," Friedman said.
Steve Martin. It's impossible to assess his performance with the nattily-attired Steep Canyon Rangers, since it was impossible to hear it. Serious feedback and barely-there vocals forced many people to abandon the packed, steamy Mustang Stage area – but not before they got their paparazzi shot. Martin handled the technical difficulties with aplomb. But his opening joke about always dreaming to play bluegrass at Stagecoach, "and today, I feel I am one step closer to that dream," took on a sad hue.
"Having a vehicle in this segment is very important to the company right now," Chrysler spokeswoman Wendy Orthman said. She added that with gas prices on the rise, "It stands to reason that these smaller cars will get more and more popular."
Later in the day, Lederkramer testified at length about former General Manager Patrick Lynch, ex-events manager Todd DeStefano, former technology manager Leopold Caudillo Jr. and one-time janitorial contractor Tony Estrada.

Meanwhile, your hippocampus, as part of its endless job of filing away new information, stores the information that something wet has just fallen on your head. But because this is a little out of the ordinary and your hippocampus recognizes it as a possible source of stress, it puts on another of its many hats. "It's the secretary for all things memory," Pruessner says, "but it also has its hand on the button to turn on your stress response."
Tales of sexual antics have surrounded other Oregon cults and communes over the years, becoming particularly vivid during the height of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh in the 1980s. The Rolls-Royce-loving guru also had a deep affection for his female acolytes, some of whom had sex with him during meditation exercises.
It already has found about 25 programs that are "seriously out of compliance" with Medicare standards, said one agency official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the findings are preliminary. Some programs have problems so severe that the agency is considering immediate decertification, the official said. That could force closure.
Klein also plugs the pizza, and deservedly so. Both the whole-grain and white-flour crusts, especially the former, are chewy taste adventures. Toppings provide just the right foil. My favorite is the earthy Napoletana ($15), with anchovies, peppers and a hint of oregano in an ample sea of mozzarella.

But the class at Life Time that most closely resembles its adult counterpart is Kids Yoga, in which kids ages 5 to 12 gather with instructor Debbie Binkofsky to practice sun salutations and warrior poses. The mood is certainly lighter than the adult yoga, but the goals are the same: flexibility, balance, strength and smooth breathing.

Again, Irving did not disagree. Asked about his problems, Irving said, "Part of it was laziness, especially on my end.

But it's really even more than that. Under stand your ground, a person might use a knife or a baseball bat. Whatever the weapon involved, it becomes difficult for police to prosecute anyone who claims to have acted in self-defense no matter how flimsy the evidence in support. It enables provocative behavior under the mantle of self-defense that can be used any time and anywhere — including against people deemed "suspicious" because of their appearance.
Nash, along with this page, had supported state legislation that would change the presumption that dependency court hearings, in which the fate of children in foster care is decided, should be closed, and would open them instead. That idea enjoyed substantial support in Sacramento until a coalition of child welfare advocates and representatives of organized labor came together to defeat the bill. Faced with an obstacle there, Nash issued an order for his court decreeing that hearings in Los Angeles County will now be presumptively open to the press, a word his order does not define, and that reporters can be excluded only if lawyers can convince a judge that their presence would create a reasonable likelihood of damage to children involved in the proceedings. His order is now in effect, and the results are encouraging.

As Shaw soon learned, that random piano on the pier was just one of 30 scattered in public spaces throughout Los Angeles — part of an international art project called “Play Me, I’m Yours” that began in mid-April and comes to an end on Thursday. Thousands of people have come out to play, from casual dabblers to struggling hopefuls to Juilliard-trained professionals. But “Play Me, I’m Yours” has also given quirkier artists such as Shaw an opportunity to perform their music for a curious-minded public — unearthing an idiosyncratic musical underground that’s been restricted to Los Angeles’s fringier venues.

At one point in our lives, for example, we might find the inspiration we need to look more closely at the life of Christ and to consider how we are being called to lives of discipleship and service for the life of the world. At another time, stumbling across the Rite I Eucharist Prayer and the phrase "by his one oblation of himself once offered, a full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction, for the sins of the whole world," we might find ourselves able to rest in the assurance that our sins have been forgiven and to find comfort in the idea that the sacrifice of Christ was complete and sufficient and needs no further work or effort on our part. In the collect for Palm Sunday (which focuses on "the example of his great humility" and asks that "we may walk in the way of his suffering, and also share in his resurrection"), we might find ourselves rejoicing in the glory of the incarnation, and humbly seeking to follow Christ's example more closely. It might even help us in times of suffering to hold fast to the hope of the resurrection, and to give thanks for the companionship that Christ offers.

McCarthy’s tenure in Newark has been marked by dramatic reductions in crime but also persistent criticism from the community for what has been perceived as heavy-handed policing tactics.
When I reviewed the restaurant a few months after it opened, it was evident that Keane was cooking at a level that put him in an elite pantheon of chefs. A return visit last week to try the Chef's Tasting menu made it clear that although he's still young -- just 35 -- he's no longer a chef to watch but rather one to emulate.
But the Times, the AP and other established news organizations no longer define the news agenda in the way they did in pre-Internet days. The passions were stoked instead by a "Burn a Koran Day" Facebook page, for example, which caught the faithful's attention in Egypt in mid-July, and by e-mails sent globally by outraged American Muslims.

Deasy said these were among the most difficult questions the district grappled with. Theoretically, value-added models inherently account for these differences, because each student's performance is compared each year with the same student's performance in the past, not with the work of other students.

Viewers finally meet escapee Frank Molesch (Stefan Kurt) in "One Minute of Darkness," primarily set in Molesch's lair in the forest. Director Christoph Hochhausler paints him as damaged man-child, not the beast lingering in the shadows of the first two films. A young runaway who befriends him and a detective with a weak heart and an open mind are equally nuanced in this finale when the veracity of much of what we learned before is questioned -- and issues of truth and innocence come into play. The characters' fragile humanity makes the ending all the more brutal.
These numbers might be a bit less alarming if charters were making sure to "not be school(s) where all the advantaged kids or all the white kids or any other group is segregated," as Shanker envisioned. According to a new report from the National Education Policy Center, however, charters "tend to be more racially segregated than traditional public schools" - and in lots of places, they seem to be openly hostile to children who are poor, who are from minority communities or who have special education needs.
