The lanes couldn't be extended any further. There are the appropriate signs and stripes out there, but I will have our traffic engineer check it to see if anything else could be added. Sometimes it's a space issue to be able to add more signs.

Every time I see a gunner fly by a returner (a la CB Michael Coe on Seahawks PR Leon Washington’s 19-yard return in the third quarter), I wonder if they even teach these guys to “break down” anymore. Coe gets down there and doesn’t stop his feet at all. Washington takes one step to his left and runs right past him as if he wasn’t even there. That helped turn a potential 50-yard net into a 34-yard net. And I’m not necessarily blaming Coe because, seriously, I don’t know if he’s told to break down or keep running. I’ll have to see if I can find out.

Another playoff miss would be their third straight.
As to why Michigan's jobless rate has closed the gap with Indiana these past two years, Hicks offered two reasons. One is an improving long-term debt outlook because of changes pushed by Gov. Rick Snyder, including a $5-billion reduction in future retiree health-care liabilities.

The pass rush. What is going on in this department? All of this stuff about blocking it up with max protections, different schemes and stuff, it doesn't hold water for me. It's like when those involved with the running game try to play the eight-men-in-the-box card. It's nothing they haven't seen, and been effective against, in the past.

In the time I was away from Foursquare, the service made a bunch of changes. There are now more opportunities to earn points — I got three simply for checking in on Martin Luther King Day and four for visiting new states.

In the entertaining "Source Code" directed by Duncan Jones, from an original and architecturally ambitious screenplay by Ben Ripley, Colter doesn't know—and neither do we—that he's part of a highly classified military research project and has been sent into the immediate past to find out who bombed that train.

This controversy over the firemen: I don't know why people are crying about it. If you couldn't see this coming after 9/11 happened, with you people voting "yes" on tax hike after tax hike after tax hike - what is wrong with you people out there? I'd like to know.

While The Forgiveness of Blood lacks the narrative momentum of director Joshua Marston's previous film, Maria Full of Grace - the story of a young Colombian smuggling drugs to the United States, desperately trying to better her lot in life - it is nonetheless fascinating. Marston has a documentarian's eye, immersing us in the culture of a people still shaking off the yoke of communism. And his empathy for Nik - a kid blindsided by century-old traditions - resonates in powerful ways.

Haley must sense a cultural kinship with other dogs accustomed to life in Chinese-speaking homes. Presumably, you and the other owners do not converse in Chinese out in the dog park or on the street. So Haley picks up the vibes from her four-legged kin. The only explanation is animal instinct, which is really the magic (Chinese: "moshu") of dogs. They are incredibly sentient creatures, with Buddha-like reserves of wisdom, knowledge and mystery.

The survey results describe a profession in transition. Independent pharmacies, which once dominated Oregon, now number just 214 out of about 750 retail pharmacies, according to state records. As independents give way to large chains and mail-order operations, increased competition is inserting a bottom-line mentality into the way people get their pills.

Some economists argue that a decision by Beijing to allow the yuan to rise would ease strains in China's economy, including inflation pressures.
It's worth noting that a strong majority of Americans still favor a public insurance option of the sort I've proposed tonight. But its impact shouldn't be exaggerated - by the left, the right, or the media. It is only one part of my plan, and should not be used as a handy excuse for the usual Washington ideological battles. To my progressive friends, I would remind you that for decades, the driving idea behind reform has been to end insurance company abuses and make coverage affordable for those without it. The public option is only a means to that end - and we should remain open to other ideas that accomplish our ultimate goal. And to my Republican friends, I say that rather than making wild claims about a government takeover of health care, we should work together to address any legitimate concerns you may have.
Clackamas and many experienced anglers are reporting excellent fishing. Clackamas summer steelhead absolutely love bait and a whole sand shrimp will put more steelhead in the creel than any other offering, but do not disregard roe or the ever-popular pink worm.

Minnesota first baseman Justin Morneau, who left Monday night's series opener after six innings because of a sore left wrist, had an MRI in Minnesota and learned there was no structural damage — only some fluid and inflammation. The 2006 AL MVP is expected to rejoin his teammates on Wednesday before the team heads to Seattle.
“With nearly half of a billion dollars lost because of human error, this hearing is an absolute must,” Oliver said in a statement. “The state, our taxpayers, and most of all our children deserve answers from the administration as to how such an egregious blunder could have been overlooked with so much as stake.”
The first game was a back-and-forth affair, with Edwardsville holding the biggest lead at 14-10. The Tigers went ahead 24-23 on a kill by John Pranger, and with Eric Fitterer serving, closed out the game on another kill by Pranger.

Not that Stephen A. Smith has to worry about his credibility — too late for that — but his recent, recidivist put-down spews against Jeremy Lin on 1050 ESPN Radio sounded designed to encourage us to believe what Smith says, rather than what we’ve seen. And I’m not quite ready for that. You?

There also is an EVP of what appears to be two people arguing, one repeating what sounds like "I'm right."
But that's somewhat of an illusion. Cheap phones have become commodity products, with fierce competition and low margins, so most phone makers are looking to smartphones for profits. But that's exactly where Apple dominates. As the world's largest buyer of chips, the company has a massive advantage in procuring components at the best prices, and consumers seem to favor the iPhone regardless of the features others use to jazz up their handsets.

But its 15-second duration was a mere hiccup in temblor terms: It was the Itty Bitty Big One. As recently as 2006, a quake in Sumatra shook for 10 minutes, and the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 kept that city and its inhabitants writhing for nearly a minute.

This is the worst Jason Statham movie since the last Jason Statham movie, carrying on the bargain-budget action star's tradition of building a body of work out of, well, dead bodies. Writer-director Boaz Yakin (who directed the gentle football drama ''Remember the Titans'' but now is back in the mode of his first-produced screenplay with Dolph Lundgren's vigilante tale ''The Punisher'') proves the ideal enabler for Statham's brand of mindless carnage. Together, they turn Manhattan into a shooting gallery, stacking up corpses in service of a supposed story about one man's path to redemption. But really, all they care about is stacking up corpses, as many as they can, ripped apart by as many bullets as possible, with a few snapped necks and other more intimate moments of savagery to break up the repetitive tedium of the gunplay. The thin story has Statham as a mystery man with deadly skills who becomes the unlikely protector of a Chinese math prodigy (newcomer Catherine Chan) on the run from Chinese and Russian mobsters. Yakin selectively leaves enough bad guys standing for no apparent reason other than the prospects of a sequel. Please, Hollywood, keep us safe from that. (R, 95 minutes)

We know we’re in for some changes as soon as we meet Alice — a fatherless 19-year-old about to be married off. She doesn’t love the boy, though, and doesn’t see a way out — until soon, fortuitously, she stumbles down a rabbit hole into a magical world.
In one breathtaking moment worthy of Steinbeck, Lynch manages to viscerally evoke a sense of Cold War dread, foreshadow the horrors of 9/11 and offer an ode to the beauty and delicacy of the idealism that built -- and goes on building -- the West: "When a 707 thunders overhead, vertebrae crack in thousands of necks. Roger drifts into the numb crowd around the International Fountain and stands silently among them, absently noticing the yellowed maple and alder leaves dangling loose, the slightest puff testing their resolve."
Best seat: The corner table facing Valencia Street gives you the best bragging rights to the hordes pressing their noses on the window. But sitting at the bar is much more fun, as it offers a chance to ask the bartenders questions like where the Mother Theresa cocktail got its name.
With the new Wolfgang Puck at Hotel Bel-Air, the Austrian chef who, along with Alice Waters, begat California cuisine, has finally achieved a quintessentially Californian restaurant, one with a legendary outdoor terrace in a verdant setting with swans gliding through ponds and enormous old trees overhanging walkways and tumbling streams.
Long Beach Township Mayor Joseph Mancini has closely watched developments in both towns and has vowed not to use eminent domain to get the 200 easements he needs. But it hasn’t been an easy sell.
They weren't thrilled either - at first - when we showed them the delights of market day in a Mexican village. Along the street, we stopped at the vendors, sampling honey from the honeycomb, and yes, even some pulverized worms. Then we ducked into the chocolate shop, where women from the surrounding hills poured in, each with her own hot chocolate recipe. The women headed to a row of grinders along the wall and filled them with their unique mixes of cocoa beans, sugar, maybe cinnamon or almonds.
The diagnosis for Seton Hall's (21-13) final game of the season will go down as getting beat once again by an inability to rebound. Second-chance opportunities — especially in the last five minutes of the game — helped the Minutemen keep pace with a battling Pirates team, before pulling away at the end. Four players, led by pint-sized guard Chaz Williams' 20 points, scored in double-figures for UMass (24-11). And while Seton Hall dug itself out of a 13-point hole in the first half, having a one-man offense in leading scorer Fuquan Edwin (21 points), simply wasn't enough.
The deal, however, is far from done.

According to Professor Michael Busler’s overwhelming statistical evidence (op-ed, “Hiking taxes on the wealthy shrinks overall tax revenue,” Sept. 19), it seems the only thing left to do is cut taxes to the wealthy even more or face serious consequences. It sounds like Mr. Busler should consider running for office as a Tea Party candidate.
Asked if he's at all anxious, he said, ‘‘There's not any anxiety at all. It's been a great run. I've had a great time. Hopefully, I'll be able to continue here. But it's a business, and they're going to make business decisions.''

The Knicks got most of the attention for moves to position themselves for James, especially when they traded away their best players for pennies on the dollar in an effort to clear the books. But Riley was just as passively aggressive in not spending, at one point last summer getting into a public battle with Wade, who was frustrated at the lack of additions to the roster.
"I love eating quarterbacks," Irvin joked during a conference call.
Timbers owner Merritt Paulson, who's been criticized by some MLS observers for what they say is a low payroll, said the signing of Boyd as a designated player pushed the player's overall cost into what he called "a seven-figure kind of guy." Signing Boyd as a designated player means some of his salary will not count against the MLS salary cap.

Ryan, now 63, was hired in 2001, and in 2004 became assistant to then-Mayor Richard De La Roche, who was ousted from office in a November 2006 recall. Her lawsuit claimed comments by two councilmen during a budget meeting that her job was "fluff" and akin to a "cheerleader" were sexist. The appellate court found the councilmen were speaking of the position and not about Ryan or her performance.

Translation: The Iranians expect to be paid, in "step-by-step" increments, as they move toward a deal. At a minimum, they will want a delay of the U.S. and European sanctions that take full effect June 28 and July 1, respectively. That timetable gives the West leverage, too -- to keep the threatened sanctions in place until the Iranians have made the required concessions. It's a well-prepared negotiation, in other words, and it seems likely to succeed if each side keeps to the script and doesn't muff its lines.
"Does it concern me? Yeah," Roy said Tuesday morning. "I would love to play more minutes and have a much better body, but it's just not the case, so I have to try and make the most of what it is.

So when we got Bil-Jac's new "Solution-based" treats that promise to target either a dog's coat, brain or immune system -- and they were small treats just right for a little mouth like Chi-Chi's -- we sent all three varieties right over.
Tinto, in particular, which came close to four bells in its initial review, had expanded to become more comfortable, but also seemed to have settled into autopilot in the kitchen, with a tasting full of repeats from a meal I'd eaten just a few months earlier. Some I was thrilled to retaste - the succulent prawns skewered around chorizo, the luxurious turbot in pastis sauce rimmed with colorful citrus, the profoundly good Iberico ham. But there were also letdowns - surprisingly bland salt cod scrambled eggs; not-hot presliced sirloin (I preferred the Berkshire pork with grilled onions from my earlier visit); and a surprisingly pedestrian flourless chocolate cake finale. And the service was rushed and sloppy, often bringing dishes before the table was cleaned. Ultimately, Tinto's high-end $70 tasting presented very little special value over simply ordering a la carte.
Still, as the documentary shows, he kept his dignity. "Jesse Owens was able to carve out his own path and sustain himself, his family and his legacy during very troubling and limited times for black men," says the documentary's producer/director Laurens Grant.

Strassel: Well, again, what you've got here is a newly minted putative GOP nominee, Mitt Romney. For them--he came out and said he was for capping these rates, and to have gone against him would have been a huge embarrassment to their new standard bearer for the party. So they decided to fold the fight. Now it's over how you pay for this. And the question is, do you strip the money, as the Republicans would like, out of the president's health-care bill to pay for this cost, or do you do what the Democrats are proposing again and again and again and again, which is to tax wealthier Americans to pay for it?

In a case built around descriptions of images of young children being restrained and sexually abused — including a bound and gagged 3-year-old with lewd words scrawled across her stomach — the judge imposed a sentence that was above the mandatory minimum of five years but less than the 10 to 12 1/2 years sought by the prosecutor.
James Beard Award-winner Chris Bianco sets the gold standard with his spectacular pizzas. The formula is quite simple: the best flour, the best cheeses, the best toppings and a no-compromise attitude. No wonder fans line up for hours.
Let's be clear: There's nothing wrong with a little skepticism, and the lack of football administration on Teague's résumé cannot be ignored. College football is too big and too important to just completely dismiss it. And given the program's long, painful history of losing, Gophers fans probably had their hopes set on a "football guy" stepping in to replace Joel Maturi.

McGrady said that neither he nor his representatives have asked for his playing time to increase, beyond his answers to questions after the game in Orlando on Wednesday.

Taping the speech gave the appearance that I was covering Mandel for The Plain Dealer. That was not, and never will be, the case.

Another big element in the immigration shift is that Mexico’s economy is puttering along rather well. There are more jobs south of the border, while the prolonged U.S. economic slump has made employment scarcer to the north. The result is that, for some Mexicans, there is more economic opportunity to be found at home than in places such as Arizona, where they are less and less welcome.

A: Well, I think it's a very complicated ... you know, bankruptcy law and all these things are extremely complicated, and at least once I tried to tell the people covering the story, you know, maybe you should sit down with an attorney and have them walk you through it because it's complicated stuff. I'm not sure that happened. From what was written it probably may not have, but there were some things written that weren't correct: that declaring bankruptcy was a big mistake, etc., etc. They were necessary steps that we had to take toward getting a resolution, which we finally got. The burden is on reporters to go out there and understand the whole, the complete lay of the land, and all you can do is try to tell your side of the story, the reasons you're doing it and what the logic is. I'm a very logical person and I don't do any of these things. Whenever you read, 'Paul made an emotional decision about something,' that's probably not correct because there's logic behind all of these things. You may not agree with the logic, but there's logic behind all of them. Certainly going through that whole bankruptcy phase was very complicated and went right up to I think it was 15 minutes before we were going to make another filing and we finally got an agreement with the lenders to get the Rose Garden back, so it was high-stakes legal ... we tried to explain, but sometimes these things are harder to understand.

Schools across Arizona are being pressured more than ever to focus on helping their lowest-performing students. The state's new way of rating schools, assigning them letter grades A through F, is intended partly to push them to make their lagging students a top priority.

The movie is filled with amazingly entertaining biographical details, ones that informed Aleichem's writing. His father was rich but went bust after being betrayed in a bad business deal; from then on Aleichem lived in poverty.

It's a location that defines the word dicey. Most places on the block have a decade worth's of soot and grit glazing the facades and windows. Yet in the middle of the block sits a celery green brick building, with a discreetly marked black storefront. Peek inside and it looks like an oasis.
Yet in American corporations today there is a "class division," he notes. Many people in business "are clueless about one of the most vital functions, the means by which you actually generate revenue." Salespeople are viewed as some sort of breed apart. "They need conventions in Las Vegas and complex commission structures," Mr. Delves Broughton writes. They must be "goaded to perform and reined in when they sell too hard. They are patronized as 'feet on the street' by those who prefer to imagine that business can be conducted by consultants with dueling PowerPoint presentations."
As it heads into its second century, Rockefeller, which holds $3.5 billion in assets and awards grants to nonprofit organizations, is focusing on international projects, including support for universal health coverage and crop insurance for farmers in Africa.

Such is the disillusionment with the socialist PASOK party and conservative New Democracy, which have been alternating in power for the last 38 years, that neither is expected to garner enough votes to form a government. Days of wrangling over forming a coalition will likely ensue, with the prospect — alarming to Greece's lenders and much of the country's population — of another round of elections if they fail.
It's not difficult to get people incensed over a speeding ticket. It's an unwanted expense, a burden of paperwork, an embarrassment, an annoyance. And perhaps worst of all, they feel like the business end of a trap, a way for government to hook the unwary.

These men have been mistreated, declared Pentagon-paid defense counsel Cheryl Borman, Bin Attash's attorney, a civilian who specializes in death-penalty cases. Borman stunned spectators by turning up at the compound in a black abaya, cloaking her from head to toe  covering her hair, leaving only her face showing. With the exception of Bin al Shibh's outburst, the men adopted looks of disinterest throughout the hearing. During recesses, they spoke animatedly between themselves and across the five rows they occupied in the courtroom, at times laughing and smiling.

Harris extends his argument into a polemic about the moral underpinnings of the justice system. If free will is an illusion, then punishing people for their actions (rather than restraining them for the protection of others) makes no sense unless we confess that we are catering to the irrational, and very human, desire for vengeance. "Once we recognize that even the most terrifying predators are, in a very real sense, unlucky to be who they are, the logic of hating (as opposed to fearing) them begins to unravel. Once again, even if you believe that every human being harbors an immortal soul, the picture does not change. Anyone born with the soul of a psychopath has been profoundly unlucky," Harris writes.
But applications haven't dropped back since then. Analysts predict that job gains of about 175,000 will be reported for April when the government issues the month's employment report next week. That's below the average of 250,000 jobs added per month from December-February.

Still, Margaret Van Vliet, the city's housing director, is eager to start the 209-unit building. She announced last month that construction would begin in November.

Whether it is depression, low academics, behavior issues or financial stresses, people should be fully aware by now that children of divorce are at a statistical disadvantage.

Instead of such reforms, the proposed legislation is as grandiose as it is clueless. Its sponsors' magniloquence reminds me of a Monty Python skit in which a character says to viewers: "Well, last week we showed you how to become a gynecologist. And this week on 'How to Do It' we're going to show you how to play the flute, how to split an atom, how to construct a box girder bridge, how to irrigate the Sahara Desert and make vast new areas of land cultivatable. But first, here's Jackie to tell you all how to rid the world of all known diseases."
