School food advocate Bettina Siegel collected 230,000 signatures on a letter to the USDA to ban LFTB. She wrote, "It is simply wrong to feed our children connective tissues and beef scraps that were, in the past, destined for use in pet food and rendering, and were not considered fit for human consumption."

My approach is one of the glass being half-full, to the point, where, admittedly, I'm a little overly optimistic in my estimates of how long something will take. If I say, for example, we'll be done in four hours, Dennis knows it's going to take us eight. And there was the time when I said I'd be done by dinner (which he, thankfully, wound up cooking), but instead I was still out working at 1 a.m.

David Halberstam, who was right about nearly everything, once wrote that if you had beamed in from another planet and wanted to feel like an American, you had to do three things: visit the Grand Canyon, read the Constitution, and watch Michael Jordan play basketball. We humbly disagree, and thought the great author should rewrite that last part.
Beyond his efforts in the small world of hot-rodding, Shelby broadly influenced how Detroit automakers thought about high-performance -- not just power, but weigh and handling.
Are you assuming Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger will play Sunday? “I would assume so. I watched him get hurt in our game, go to the locker room then come out and continue to play. Then, I watched him against the 49ers go out and play and he’s a tough soul so I imagine he’s going to want to be out there with his team.”
Also today, the Trail Blazers announced that guard Elliot Williams underwent successful surgery to repair a dislocated right patella.

“We believe union labor builds best,” Healy said in a statement, adding the measure approved this week by the council “closes any loopholes that developers may have tried to use to circumvent” the city’s PLA regulations.
Stokes stressed that no plans are final yet on the funding or state spending on the 985-acre park that is one of Detroit's major jewels. He hopes to meet with city officials in the next 30 days to review annual costs and map out which infrastructure improvements are needed.
"It could have taken 50 years for the river to get the way it was," she said, when it tested out as impaired as recently as 2002. "So it's impressive to bring it back this quickly. Just even stabilizing a situation like this is hard, much less improving it.
CLEVELAND When leaving friends and co-workers for a new job, only a move closer to home can make the change easier.
20. William McKinley was shot and killed in September 1901. He was succeeded by a man his campaign manager called “that damned cowboy.” Who was that?
Carol-Ann Mendoza is a professional coupon-clipper, if there were such a thing. Manufacturer coupons. BOGO deals. She's mastered them all.
On a more serious note, Adams' tactics smack of desperation. And probably for good reason. Because while she's long on criticisms of Mica, she's short on positive things to say about herself.
In September 2010 Kelly, who is building a home in Eugene, signed a $20.5 million contract with Oregon that runs through 2016. His base salary was $2.8 million last season and his buyout is $3.5 million. Kelly endeared himself with the Ducks’ most famous alum, Nike co-founder Phil Knight, and proceeded to put his stamp allover the Oregon program with both his dizzying offensive style and his mantra of Win The Day, found on signs throughout Autzen Stadium.
So, lots of shots signifying almost nothing. That's also not been the case, generally, so far this year.
A prospective employer would not only get one of the top deep threats in NFL history, but one with a history of controversy.

"It is not the remarkable chapeaux of this redoubtable woman we are defending," The Oregonian's Editorial Board protested in 1949, "but rather her inalienable right to pick her own hats and wear them when, as and if she chooses." Yet the same piece called her a "mighty fine looking woman."
In the evening I actually will head to a private olive oil tasting at Extra Virgin, an Olive Ovation in Clayton. Not one who grew up with olive oil on the table, my taste buds have grown to accept it and look forward to its many uses and nuances. Lemon Crunch Cod Fillets bind seasonings with it for a light presentation, taking advantage of the many seasonal seafood specials on this bonus day of the year. The main dish can be ready in less than 30 minutes.

That's not to say Americans think the economy is getting better. Just 11% describe the state of the economy as good, while 46% say not so good and 42% say poor. And by a 50% to 44% margin, voters say they trust Romney more than Obama at handling the economy.
Executive branch officials under Deal’s authority took at least $25,000 in lobbyists’ gifts since the order took effect in January 2011, according to state records. The findings arise from a unique partnership in which a reporter from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution worked with Emory University’s investigative journalism class to review compliance with the governor’s order.

And in Los Angeles, the method can be used for only a portion of the district's roughly 14,000 elementary school instructors: California students don't take the test until second grade and teachers must have had enough students for the results to be reliable.
Rather, we should remind ourselves that the Blazers were given another opportunity to get this Michael Jordan vs. Bowie thing correct -- and whiffed again. Which is only to say they must now make their own luck.

Over the past two years, European governments supported their financial sectors with €4.59 trillion in state aid, according to figures released Wednesday. While the overwhelming majority of that aid, €3.94 trillion, was given as loan guarantees, the case of Ireland has shown how expensive those guarantees can become if banks run into more serious trouble. On Sunday, Dublin accepted €67.5 billion ($89 billion) in bailout loans after the collapse of its banks drove government deficits to an EU postwar record of 32 percent.
McCourt did meet a Monday deadline to pay a $131-million divorce settlement to his ex-wife, Jamie, according to a person familiar with the matter but not authorized to comment, eliminating the possibility that she could intervene in the sale process.

Remembered by most in town as Ristorante Garbini, Homestead Restaurant or Cafe Neena, the Broad Street location is offering breakfast, lunch and dinner, inspired by several types of cooking.
Frankly, it doesn't matter why Quinn opposes racinos or the rest of the proposed legislation. Take him at his word that he believes the expansion plan is just too top-heavy. The only thing that matters is that Quinn opposes it.

Both hope the national exposure will launch their stand-up careers to the next level. Dalton, who lives in Lakewood, is seeking a spot on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" or "The Late Late Show" with Craig Ferguson. O'Reilly is finding it easier to open doors with bookers by simply saying Comedy Central thought he was funny enough to put on the air. Both are hoping

Due to the miracle of Google, we have a source, ladies and gents: Joyce Brothers. (Personal and perhaps unwarranted footnote: One of many part-time jobs I held while I was in college was answering phones in the customer service department of Bloomingdale's in New York. What I remember is that when Brothers called to arrange the pickup and return of a mattress she had purchased but deemed unsatisfactory - her call was a big event in the history of that job - she didn't sound as though she was "loving it all.")
The NCAA Tournament Selection Committee has been trying to set up this match for years, though. In 1992, the Buckeyes' overtime loss to Michigan's Fab Five prevented a meeting with UC in the Final Four. In 2000, Kenyon Martin's broken leg and Ohio State's inability to recapture the Scoonie Penn tournament magic of the season before prevented a Sweet 16 matchup.

“It was awful just watching him deteriorate,” she says, hanging her feet off the pedals, resting before she gets up.
Soldiers are, of course, screened before and after deploying. But although this process involves multiple questionnaires and a review of medical records, it varies from base to base. No physiological tests are used, and soldiers may or may not see clinicians. Assessments are highly subjective and have been criticized for relying on self-reports. After all, soldiers may not be honest about their problems. If injured or unstable, they may be unable to deploy with teammates who rely on them or may face delays in going home.
"I’ve seen him on YouTube," said Nora Espinoza, a Republican member of the New Mexico state House of Representatives. "He’s great. My father always said you have to call a spade and spade and he calls a spade a spade."
While the Great Recession wiped out the local assistance grants, lawmakers continued to find ways to put a few local projects — money to spruce up small-town airports or extra funding for favorite schools — in the budget. And they continued to borrow.

The anti-sugar brigade features some of the biggest names in nutrition, including Harvard's Dr. Walter Willett and Yale's Kelly Brownell. But the de facto leader is Dr. Robert Lustig, professor of clinical pediatrics at UC San Francisco. His 2009 lecture "Sugar: The Bitter Truth" has snagged more than 2 million views on YouTube so far. He upped the ante in February with an article that called for new taxes on added sugar and age limits for certain sweet treats. To top it off, he declared on an April 1 episode of "60 Minutes" that added sugar was a "toxic" substance that has "created a public health crisis."
But the capital remained a scene of mourning — not protest — today. U.S. and South Korean military officials said there had been no unusual military movements by the North Koreans in recent days.
Congress last year passed legislation requiring the release of some of the information being fought over in this lawsuit.
Ben's pie-in-the-sky hopes inspire his teacher and eventually his whole class. The movie, based on Kersjes' book about his real-life experience, follows him and assistant teacher Robynn McKinney (Jessy Schram) as they first try to persuade Space Camp (founded in 1982 to encourage interest in math, science and astronomy) to give the kids a chance, and then to figure out whether the kids are actually up to the challenge. Beyond that, how can they raise the $50,000 needed to pay for the trip? The resolution to all those questions is actually pretty thrilling.

A few key facts about outdoor recreation in the Bay Area and Northern California that can change your life:
The degree of sedentariness the researchers recorded was extreme: "For parents, the near-perfect lack of vigorous activity is essentially a constant," the authors wrote. And for the most part, the children's activity levels, while a little higher, tracked directly with that of their parents. Even scarier, they noted, was that many of these inactive children--the girls in particular--would likely follow an established pattern for Hispanics, and become even more inactive as they progressed to adolescence and adulthood.
He has said that giving schools more money will only make them spend more. The board last year voted against having the measure on the ballot.

"I think we have to remember how furious of a run they made in the fourth quarter (in Game 4). We have to know we're going to get their best. It's like they're fighting for air. They're going to scrap and fight and do what they have to do to try to steal a game here."

As speaker of the Ohio House, Republican Husted helped create the state's early voting system by allowing absentee voting for any reason for five weeks before an election.'
The third is a lost instrument of the filmmaker's art: The long take. While the sex scenes are products of frenetic editing, the emotional sequences in Shame are shot in sustained real time and are so in-your-face that I felt like a personal-space invader overwhelmed by Brandon's palpable repression of feeling and Sissy's almost narcotized expression of it. (Watch her sing, in extreme close-up, the anthemic "New York, New York" as though it were a dirge. Watch his face when his boss explains that his computer has been seized because it's "filthy."

After reviewing the history of Vietnam going back before World War II, he went on, "I no longer believe that it was necessary for us to get involved in South Vietnam to stop Communist aggression." This confession, sharply in conflict with Republican policy at the time, was harmful enough. Romney's admission of having been brainwashed was worse, underscoring the growing criticism that he was indecisive on the prime foreign policy issue of the day.

It's sad to say but my encounters aren't unique or unusual in the black community. My friends have had the same encounters with the area's finest. I know their jobs are dangerous and demanding but they picked their profession. Some people say minorities cry foul or racism too much. Then these same people become apologists for bad decisions and behavior by the police.
Among the findings: The segment that exploded in September 2010 would never have been installed by crews in the 1950s if PG&E had better records at the time because it would have been clearly substandard. Instead, the reused pipe had been wrapped and crews could not see its defects.

Like turkeys, larger whole fish have proportionally more to eat than smaller fish. Allow 12 to 16 ounces per person when purchasing uncooked whole, "round" fish (which means gutted with head and tail on). If the fish is too large to fit your pan, ask the fishmonger to remove its head and tail, or do it yourself when you get home.
GAME 7 *
This week is traditionally the holiest of the year for Christians. What lessons can Christians and people of other faiths learn from the life of Jesus Christ?
Dropping close games: When the game is on the line, the Blazers have struggled to close the deal. Portland is 1-4 in games decided by five points or fewer, compared with its 15-12 record in such games last season. Not all good teams shine in close games. The Miami Heat last season advanced to the NBA Finals despite a paltry 6-14 record in these games in the regular season. But every Western Conference playoff team was .500 or better in this category during the 2010-11 season, and finalists Dallas and Oklahoma City each won more than 60 percent of such games.

MICDS (71 points) powered its way to the Class 3 state title last season, mainly on the legs of Lauren Waterbury, who won the long jump, the 200 and 400 meters and anchored the first-place 800-meter relay squad.

The board voted unanimously Monday night to consider terminating her contract.
Morris has already encountered Hattie with two friends, armed with paint guns, squatting in an unfinished building whose construction crew is supervised by Steven. The ultimate link in this zany chain of connection is forged when Morris, by chance, runs into Steven, whom he hasn't seen in years, and is welcomed as a long-lost pal. You idly wonder what will happen when Steven learns about Morris' relationship with Stephanie.
Orlando has had little problem at either end of the floor during an eight-game winning streak over Cleveland, which dates to a 115-106 road loss Feb. 11, 2010. The Magic, whose average margin of victory during that streak is 10.8 points, won both meetings this season by a combined 21.

The restaurant's potential became more apparent on the second and third visits. For starters, the margarita ($5) -- made with agave wine instead of Tequila because the restaurant doesn't have a liquor license -- still has some of that appealingly bitter, tar-like edge of Tequila, in this case balanced by fresh sparkling limeade.

A football Saturday is about showcasing the school and its campus. This is a tradition that Colorado State is lacking.

Its a wonder two or three players dont walk off the field every play with an injury. And it makes you wonder just how many players are staying out there on the field and are playing with an injury.

“My wife and I bought breakfast for a bunch of Rangers one morning and found that they were really great guys,” said Ermer. “We started helping them and raised $65,000 for a Ranger ball for 1,200 people. After that, they made me an honorary member. Then one day they told me I’d be president of the Ranger Memorial. We raised $300,000 for that, but what resulted would’ve cost over $1 million because so many people donated supplies and services. Savannah is such a great military town.”

I'm extremely motivated that i've never had to look at the kids and give them the speech. I don't even know what I would say. That keeps me on the road scouting or up late at night or doing whatever I can and hopefully I'm not over-coaching. But to have to look at these kids and say: 'Better luck next year' -- I'd rather not.

The adviser, Ronald Miskoff, said he would meet with the Daily Medium's editors this weekend to discuss Marcus' complaint and the university's investigation.

* A day doesn't go by without tweets or e-mails aimed in my direction, asking me why the Rams haven't fired head coach Steve Spagnuolo. No. 1, I don't own the team. If you'd give me a few billion dollars I'd be happy to purchase the franchise from Stan Kroenke. He'll ultimately make the decisions on GM Billy Devaney and Spagnuolo. It's Kroenke's business. But he isn't going to fire Spagnuolo during the middle of the season, so I sincerely and politely suggest that we settle down a bit and just ride out the remaining games on the schedule. There's no use in getting lathered up about something, an in-season coaching change, that isn't going to happen
Super Bowls usually are about quarterbacks, and Tom Brady and Eli Manning are likely to find themselves in a shootout. The matchup of Manning versus the Patriots defense favors the Giants.
The folks in the nonprofit world might not understand rising labor costs, but they do understand falling revenues -- and the cost-cutting that follows. When foundation money is more difficult to come by in tough economic times, they have to adapt: A survey by Campbell and Co. in the midst of the Great Recession found that nearly half of the nonprofit organizations surveyed were using employee layoffs to manage costs. Others were reducing salaries, hours or benefits.

As Beavan had his back turned toward the plate, the ball caromed off his pitching elbow to third for the start of an around-the-horn, inning-ending, run-denying double play. Beavan left the game at that point with a bruised pitching elbow _ but he left it only down, 1-0.

3. Ask questions of the proprietor. It's a great opportunity to learn more about plants from people who, with the rarest of exceptions, are passionate and knowledgeable about what they've raised for sale. There's a lot more to know about a plant than simply what it says on the tag. Often, a tag will say a plant will get to a certain size, but then you find in a few years it's taken over your garden. Dennis bought a Larix kaempferi 'Diana' and the tag said it would grow to 10 feet tall and 4 feet wide. Which it did, but it didn't stop there. After four years, it's 15 feet tall and 8 feet wide. And while we love it, it would have been nice to know how big it was actually going to get.
"There is much anger, much sorrow about what happened in these three cases," Buchanan said.

So compelling, in fact, that he was able to convince eight other gigantic personalities to adopt it. It's hard to imagine any one Wu emcee ceding authority to anybody else; Robert Diggs got all of them to follow his lead. The Wu-Tang Clan was supposed to be too fissile to hang together for long, but there they were on the Starland stage last week, rhyming like it was 1993. Ghostface and Raekwon may find the RZA's quasi-spiritual schtick wearisome by now, but they know that if it wasn't for his determination, they'd still be rapping for each other in Staten Island. As RZA reminds us in "The Tao of Wu," no record company wanted any part of the Clan -- they were too weird, too esoteric, and too cerebral. But once the independently produced "Protect Ya Neck" got loose on rap radio, there was no stopping this crew. It was like A Tribe Called Quest's "Scenario" reimagined for lunatics who'd been holed up in a basement with a stack of Marvel comics, a chessboard, and lots of ganja. In other words, it was made for would-be roughneck intellectuals. The labels were wrong, and the kids in the basements were right. Not for the first time, either.

Cruz won the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Drama -- the first Latino to do so -- for his story of Cuban-Americans caught between the traditional ways of the island they came from and the machine-driven modernity of their adopted home. His script is more than a reminder that Cuban exiles were active in America long before Castro took power, however. With its lush, metaphorical language and rich sensory detail, it paints a romantic picture of the immigrant experience, hovering between passionate hope and crushing realism.

Although paternity in this case has not yet been proven, I think the controversy raises an important teachable moment for parents and teens. We often hear "age ain't nothing but a number," and many couples with age differences are proof positive that May-December romances are valid, yet when it comes to adolescence, this simply is not the case. The teenage years are a time of intense physical, emotional and sexual development, and even a difference of a few years can lead to undue sexual pressure and serious complications.

While plenty of these products are indeed organic and sustainable, others are not. And, unfortunately, you can't rely on the name of the product or the manufacturer's claims to tell you which is which. You have to look for the list of ingredients -- often in small print -- to determine whether a product really is good for the environment.
I wrote a recurring skit for the Prime Time Players in which Howard and "the boys," as we called them, sat in a Monday Night Football-like booth reviewing the nonsports events of the week as sportscasters might. But the edginess of the parody was blunted by Howard's new timidity, and the boys got bored. Soon after our show was blissfully put out of its misery, they joined the Not Ready for Prime Time Players on the rightful Saturday Night Live.
John Isner defeated Feliciano Lopez, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (4), 6-3, to advance to the final of the U.S. Clay Court Championship at River Oaks Country Club in Houston.

If the words "Measure Q" on T-shirts aren't meant to encourage people to vote yes, then surely all those lawn signs that say "Obama-Biden '08" are just there to let you know who's on the ballot. What nonsense. Voters may go for many of the local measures on the Nov. 4 ballot, but shady tactics with public money will just make it harder to win their trust the next time cities, school boards and other agencies come asking for more.
I was initiated into the cult of chicken and waffles at Lüke, a Franco-German brasserie by celebrity chef John Besh in New Orleans. The Gram & Dun version is accompanied by ramekins of maple syrup and hot sauce for dipping.

Yet the proposal would still affect thousands of companies, from the local bakery to hugely profitable law firms, whose owners pay individual income taxes on the earnings, not corporate taxes. Republicans say taxing these companies would snatch away money they could otherwise use to create jobs—a damaging move with the economy still laboring to recover from the recession.
