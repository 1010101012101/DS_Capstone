A nurse navigator is someone who acts as a patient advocate tailoring the care to best fit each patient.

Season recap: With Xavier fielding an inexperienced squad this season, Schmelzel was called on to be the leader. She thrived in that role, not only being a vocal presence among the players but she set the standard on the course. Her match average this season on nine holes was 34, and she had a putting average of 14 strokes per round. She played her best at the Division I state tournament. Schmelzel was the only player in Xavier's top five who had any state tournament experience, and she used that to guide Xavier to the team title. She also nabbed the individual championship, shooting a two-day total of 7-under-par 137.
And Stevens feels that her mother, who was a decorator, was guiding her through the almost two-year process. "She would have loved the changes we've made," she said.
Julian and Henry Crowe each had four points on three goals and an assist, and Joseph Connor, Joe Ferber, Alec Barth and Flanigan all scored for Rockhurst
What troubles me is that hotels don't seem to be listening to their guests when they revert to a pay-for-access model and get aggressive about maximizing their revenue. Most hotel guests need a clear, fast wireless signal, and they'd prefer it to be included in their room rate. Guests who prefer not to 'subsidize" wireless access can always stay at hotels that charge to get online - there will always be a few that do.

Not to miss: Classic fried chicken. Anything with the house-cured bacon, which chef/co-owner Adam Sappington strews liberally throughout the menu. It's worth the calories and cardiac risk. The nicely balanced cocktails, like the Kentucky Housewife or the Fine and Dandy.
Tiana Vazquez, 21, of Allentown, and Joshua Colon, 20, also of Allentown, were both arrested and charged.
NEWARK -- A prosecutor told an Essex County jury today that a recording of a 911 call was not enough evidence to acquit Jeffrey Ayers of murder -- even if the victim is heard naming someone else as the shooter during the call.
The Hockey News: "The Sharks boast a nice arsenal of big, strong forwards who can hold onto the puck and exert pressure in the offensive zone. Not surprisingly, this possession game also strikes often on the power play, where the team has really clicked. Moving weapons such as Patrick Marleau and Logan Couture to different lines makes for tough matchups, too."
Brown, against whom Newsom competed last year before dropping out of the Democratic primary race, has shown no inclination to travel out of state or abroad for any length of time - or even to deliver Newsom any particular portfolio.

A 23-year resident of Streetsboro, Broska has encyclopedic knowledge of the community without the brashness or fast talk of up-and-comer Brett M. McClafferty, 23. Also in the race is write-in Stacey Vadaj, 54, a city zoning inspector and Scott loyalist.
As for putting so many pieces by different composers on the same program, Dawson laughingly calls it a "hodgepodge," and then explains that "I like to put programs together with different instruments and timbre. Choral programs do not have to be all-chorus."
Fourteen different players have committed the 17 second-half penalties. Right tackle Phil Loadholt has false-started twice on third-and-3, killing both drives.

But it's important to note that TFF didn't actually conclude with Saturday's flashy gala. It ends Sunday, with a final lineup that more aptly represents the festival's wide-ranging options. See the dark romance "While We Were Here," and revel in Kate Bosworth's increasingly interesting choices. Check out the effectively stark "First Winter" - about hipster Brooklynites on a disastrous retreat - if you're hoping to discover a tiny, offbeat indie. Shed some tears at the beautifully-acted adolescent drama "Death of a Superhero." Or help yourself to the official best of the fest: all of this year's award winners will be screening Sunday, too.
Digital Color International: Jim Hoffman was appointed vice president of sales and marketing for the Akron provider of printing and marketing solutions.
Most pizza can be judged a few different ways: crust taste and texture, toppings, sauce, quality, presentation, etc. I like to order a plain pepperoni whenever I'm trying a new place to get an even comparison. How can anyone reasonably compare one shop's best BBQ chicken pizza against another's Sicilian sausage or white pizza?

"Dropped Names": If Frank Langella's memoir simply did what its title promises, it would be deep-dish gossip. But his memories of the stars he's encountered during a lengthy career on Broadway and in film shed perceptive light on the costs of pursuing and maintaining fame. There are revealing tidbits like his description of a relaxed President Jack Kennedy howling at Noel Coward's jokes and doing a soft-shoe routine with Fred Astaire's sister Adele. And considering the impressions he offers of Anne Bancroft's egotism and Richard Burton's boozy decline, Paul Newman gets off easy by just being called dull. Whether he's flattering or skewering, Langella doesn't shy away from noting that celebrities are just like us, precisely because they're flawed human beings.

On Sept. 11, 2001, as we sat transfixed to our televisions, we were overwhelmed with empathy for those in the towers and the planes and the Pentagon. We tried to imagine what was happening to them and waited for news of survivors. As the long week wore on and it became clear that none would emerge, something extraordinary occurred as we turned to the future. Our nation and people from around the world, in a stunning show of compassion, gave freely and generously to benefit the families and the survivors. Many gave who had little to spare.
According to the plaintiffs, Humphreys announced to paramedics and civilian witnesses that he had found cocaine belonging to Chasse, when in fact he knew that what he had found and bagged as evidence were bread crumbs, court files say. Steenson planned to argue that the three officers failed to disclose to the paramedics and jail medical staff the full extent of their struggle with Chasse, and Humphreys and other officers falsely told witnesses that Chasse had cocaine convictions, was transient and on drugs.

Dixon dipped into Paramore's songbook, easing us in with a vulnerable vocal while playing piano. Then, the song kicked in and he stood up and went for it, standing on top of the piano while making a case for himself as an even newer Adam Lambert than James Durbin. J.Lo pronounced him a "relevant artist," which seems about right, while Randy proclaimed him "our own little indie alt-rocker." And he's got the hair to pull it off.

Our response to life defines us. I don't want to be an angry American, or a fearful one. I also don't want to be a forgetful one. I can't dismiss an entire decade of recent history as a woeful waste of time, for me or for my country. We are in a tough spot. How we survive it, and how we remember it, will determine who we are at the end of it.

The farmer (the reliably terrific Gary Norman), who has found the wounded man, views him with a mix of awe and suspicion, yet treats him with basic human decency. The farmer’s daughter, Evie (Britt Harris as a starry-eyed idealist), says that he glows and considers his arrival an omen of good fortune. The translator (Andy Lee-Hillstrom, hiding mean-spiritedness behind mildness) sees him as a vehicle for propaganda and/or revenge. The trader (played by Joel Harmon as a perpetually annoyed middle-manager) disavows ethical or political considerations, declaring his loyalty to “the margin.”
Kurt Thomas was a smart addition, but is 39 and leaves the Blazers too short to play big minutes at center. Coach Nate McMillan doesn't yet fully believe in Chris Johnson. And moving Lamarcus Aldridge from his natural position at power forward for more than token minutes at center feels like the wrong play.

With the nation's unemployment rate stubbornly stuck above 8 percent and millions of Americans out of work, Obama has tried to portray congressional Republicans as obstructing his economic agenda.

Taco María is a product of that natural selection. The truck is helmed by Carlos Salgado, whose culinary pedigree instantly drove Taco María onto the radar screen of every serious Orange County eater. His has indeed an impressive résumé: Salgado served as pastry chef in some of the Bay Area's top restaurants, including Daniel Patterson's Coi and Oakland's Commis. He returned home to Orange County to help his parents transform the family's taquería. Taco María is what emerged from that reinvention, a truck that's constantly re-imagining lonchera traditions with the techniques and style of Mexican alta cocina.

One of my best childhood friend's mother, a student of mine, a woman I worked with at the Pacifica Co-op preschool, my sister's housemate, my co-worker's daughter, the beautiful boy I spent summers babysitting as a teenager and most recently my daughter's classmate. All these people chose to end their own life. I do not fully understand the sadness and despair that lead to that decision but I do know the pain, confusion and loss that is left after.

This fall, with Crist under center and a new offensive system in place, Weis says he'd like to get Pierson the ball about 15 times a game. Maybe more. Maybe less. The Jayhawks have depth at running back, Weis says, and there's no reason to let Pierson take a pounding.
It was much the same story at the house of Hermès, the vaunted French maker of saddles and tackle as far back as 1837. Designer Véronique Nichanian put that mastery of leather to work in an unexpected way — a streetwear-inspired hooded sweatshirt in suede with a silk lining. It's hard to think of any place on earth but Southern California where a guy might buy such an item, much less wear it (I can see Jeremy Piven buying two — one in "aniseed" green and one in red). The collection also includes uncharacteristically preppy madras checks, roughly textured cotton seersuckers and drapy V-neck pullover sweaters.
The California Highway Patrol responded. One of the officers looked over the railing. He saw a body floating about 100 yards east of the bridge and dropped a flare.
I sure hope women don't let people like Mr. Limbaugh suppress their lives and those of their daughters. He's the ignorant one to think it's all about sex. But then again maybe we should just keep this a secret about how women really want to empower themselves.

øMaybe this is the wave of the future, although it's not really that new.
Baseball's opening day in April will roughly coincide with another opening day: the move of Elliott Bay Books from its longtime home in Pioneer Square to a new location in the Capitol Hill. Like many independent bookstores, Elliott Bay has had to struggle in a digital world where selling analog devices (books) isn't the business it once was. Bookstore workers said the new building will give Elliott Bay the dedicated parking it's never had in Pioneer Square, which also has the sensitive issue of the high population of transients who give the area an uncomfortable if not dangerous feel, especially at night. The wonderfully eclectic Elliott Bay Cafe will stay in the basement of the Pioneer Square building, hoping that the lunch crowds coming in for veggie chili and organic doughnuts will keep coming when the book store is gone.

2. In your essay on the subject of hell you said, "I happen to be one of those who think God will eventually incinerate some people". That sounds like a fairly literal understanding of hell.

I like Lady Gaga, and always have. I admire her entertainment-biz smarts and acknowledge her deep respect for pop history. She’s made excellent career moves and, almost incidentally, recorded some exciting music. But with "Born This Way," she’s pushed the machine too far. Curiosity will catapult the single to the top of the charts. Once it’s there, though, there’s no taking it back: every radio speaker in America will be broadcasting its essential ordinariness. Gaga has managed to sell millions of records while retaining credibility among hipsters. That ends now. This too-safe effort is going to demolish her cool.

If Democrats wrest control of the Legislature, they'll aim squarely at raising taxes on the wealthy as a way to help plug the state's perpetual money gap and fund schools, health care and services for the poor.

At the Shiley Eye Center at UC San Diego, we usually do it as an outpatient procedure.

Maybe it was because he so keenly felt the premature loss of his own childhood to stardom and the limelight that he went to such lengths to keep his children's identity private. Who can forget the bizarre shots of the children in masks and scarves over their faces? Strange or not, it worked. Could you pick them out of a line-up?

WASHINGTON - One moment he boasts about taking out America's No. 1 enemy, and the next he vows to bring home troops from an unpopular war.

"The thought is, you start with the premise that you're going to test" all kits, said Schumaker, a former Clark County prosecutor. "Then the question becomes, what carve-outs do you have? Because if you don't make those carve-outs, as you heard, the process can be slowed down and interfered on the kits that are the top-priority kits."

"You had a coach and maybe 300 kids come out for a tryout. The coach has to evaluate the kids in a matter of two hours. You can't evaluate how good each player is like that.

If it seems odd, perhaps even dysfunctional, that an organization would operate without a permanent GM for an entire season and dangle a group of executives along the way, Miller says it’s an unfortunate byproduct of circumstance. After kicking the tires on six GM candidates over the summer, Miller suspended the search on Nov. 16, when it was a real possibility the lockout would wipe out the entire season and he thought a new GM’s salary was better spent preserving jobs within the organization.

Whatever Americans pay for gasoline, increasing domestic production to 10 million barrels a day would cut combined crude oil and gasoline imports in half — saving at least $150 billion a year. That money would be spent in the United States on cement, steel, engineering services and the like, and by my estimates, it would boost gross domestic product by $250 billion, create about 2.5 million jobs and lower unemployment to less than 7 percent.

Saying this brings no pleasure. Of all the recent comic-book transplants to the big screen, Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker has been the most likable, quirky and reliably human, even when he's squirting web-juice from his hands as the semi-superhuman Spider-Man. And the series has gained in grace from Peter's fraught love for Kirsten Dunst's winsome and endearing Mary Jane Watson. Yet the third go-round conventionalizes its hero by throwing him into repetitive struggles with his dark side. (Clothes and the man make each other here, since the black symbiotic substance that's responsible for his darkness and alarming arrogance turns his costume from red and blue to jet black.) And the script traps him and M.J. in a domestic struggle that's straight out of "A Star Is Born."

By dwelling on the negative, Romney would risk turning the case for his own candidacy into nothing more than “I’m the best you’ve got, you might as well go with me.” There are precedents for such candidacies, and they are not good ones: Michael Dukakis in 1988 and Bob Dole in 1996.

I recently heard a prominent local meteorologist sharing "Brokeback" hesitation with members of the "KNBR Morning Show," who have since committed themselves on air to see the movie together.

Another reported midlife problem is decreased interest in sex. This is certainly not a necessary or usual symptom of menopause. In fact, most women either experience no change or report an improvement in their sexual lives at menopause. When this is not the case, multiple factors are generally involved including thinning of the vaginal tissues with resultant discomfort, medications which can affect sexual desire and negative body image.
Love says she never okayed the use of the song in the movie, but TMZ says she controls only part of the Nirvana catalog, and producers of the 2011 film “The Muppets” got permission from Dave Grohl (who cameoed in the movie) and Krist Novoselic, the band’s surviving members, to license the song for the barbershop version used in the movie.

Fans should remain grounded, however. Do not expect the Cavs to be able to just trade for a star player with it. They can break it into pieces and, frankly, that is what is most likely.

Hey, Tony: Will Randy Lerner ever address the fans? Obviously Tom Heckert has failed in two drafts. Mike Holmgren obviously is past his prime. His hiring of Pat Shurmur is a joke. Lerner should refund season-ticket holders. This franchise embodies ineptitude at all levels and they don't even seem to care. Why is that? Obviously the only chance for us to succeed is to force Lerner to sell the team. -- James Heneghan, Swedesboro, N.J.

Finally, we stopped by the Cuesta Ray Cigar Bar, which I'm told is the only bar of its kind in a major-league ballpark.

In between is a comfy lounge area with a large flat-screen TV, where fans can watch the game in a quiet, low-key atmosphere. The real selling point is the large, outdoor patio that offers a view of downtown St. Pete — a great place to kick back as the sun goes down if you need a break between innings. That's exactly what we did before heading back in to watch the rest of the game from above the Rays touch tank, a small pool filled with actual rays. Game result: Rays, 7-4.

If, as the ads suggest, the whole world will be watching this, viewers will likely be satisfied with what they see.
Sitek was also a forceful voice in the room, weighing in on sounds and direction, but with none of the baggage a full band member would carry.

So skip the pointless "Were you playing on the iPad instead of doing your homework?" which is going to get you the inevitable (and untrue) "No!" Instead, say to your child: "'You were playing on your iPad when I told you not to. You broke our rule and the consequence is this,'" Brown Braun says. "And then you impose your appropriate consequence."

It was the same thing with incline. Even when I'd selected a "speed" workout, my "Coach" had me hoofing up and down hills, adjusting the grade every few minutes and never dropping below 1 percent.

* In losing the first three games of the conference semifinals, the Blues are also dealing with something that they haven't experienced for a long time: a draining loss of confidence. The Blues were shaken by the loss of defenseman Alex Pietrangelo late in the second period of Game 1. He's their best player. His skills are crucial to the Blues in every aspect of the game. But I was surprised by how the Blues collapsed in Game 2. Their failure to handle the Pietrangelo affair was stunning. Sure, he returned in Game 3, but by then the damage was done. The Blues' confidence was shot, and the Kings were in complete command. The Blues' customary resilience disintegrated when Petro was taken out on a dirty hit. The Kings, already confident, were absolutely emboldened by the Pietrangelo hit job and the Blues' subsequent non-response.
