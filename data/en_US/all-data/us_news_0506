The layoff of the primary wage earner calls for a family meeting. It is a time for major changes and evaluation of priorities. One woman actually told me, "If I can have them cut off the heat, we can still afford premium cable." It is not a time for panic, overreaction and snap decisions. One miner told me he had bought a very expensive pickup two weeks before the shutdown was announced . "I sold it within two days at a big loss," he regretfully told me.

Growing herbs indoors requires the same conditions as outdoors - plenty of sunlight and good drainage. A south or west window is best, although supplemental lighting kept close to the plants can help make up for lack of sunlight. Herbs grown indoors tend to be less productive but still a better alternative than using dried herbs in terms of flavor.

Amanti Vino was one of several places where I shopped for the wines for my tasting (Crush Wine on 57th Street in Manhattan is another top German wine source). I focused on the most popular styles—dry and off-dry, aka trocken, feinherb and kabinett—and stayed within a price range of $15 to $40 a bottle. I chose wines from the 2010 and 2011 vintages with a few stragglers from 2009—a very good vintage, though the wines aren't much around.

Food industry groups pooh-poohed the complaint.

After seeing the museum and temple, my favorite thing to do is stroll the streets. Kyoto was spared the bombing of World War II, so it is still a city of tiny stores.

I hope the Blues are more committed physically against a big LA team, and start winning more of those battles in tight spaces. I hope the Blues' best players start playing like the Blues' best players. I hope Alex Pietrangelo can give this team a boost if he returns in Game 3, and that fellow defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk can get his game in order. I hope the Blues forwards remember that their persistent, effective backchecking was an important factor in the team's superb defensive performance this season. It's time to work harder.

No such prohibition exists in the budget process against committing Medicare savings simultaneously to Medicare and to pay for a new federal program. It's this budget loophole, unique to Medicare, that gives the health law's spending constraints and payroll tax hikes the appearance of reducing federal deficits. But it is appearance, not reality. If you have only $1 of income and are obliged to pay a dollar each to two different recipients, then you will have to borrow another $1. This is effectively what the health law does. It authorizes far more in spending than it creates in savings.

Hettenbach's ruling comes just two months after a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision, referred to as Hosanna-Tabor, held that religious employees of a church cannot sue for employment discrimination.

Let's start with the most basic premise – Santorum's confident assertion that "the vast majority" of Republicans who now support Gingrich would turn to Santorum if the choice was between him and Romney.

There is no proof that prosecution deters abusers. The story of Dixie Shanahan illustrates the failure of the criminal justice system to deter abusive behavior. Residents of Defiance, Iowa, were aware that Scott Shanahan regularly and brutally abused his wife. Mr. Shanahan was convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence after punching Ms. Shanahan, and he served two days in jail. Undeterred, three months later, Mr. Shanahan was convicted of another assault and served four days in jail. After his release, Scott Shanahan redoubled his abuse — so much so, that when he was arrested and charged with felony domestic violence, Dixie Shanahan fled rather than testify against him. His abuse did not end until Dixie Shanahan fatally shot her husband to prevent him from killing her and their unborn child. She is serving a sentence of 10 years to life in prison.

I think he's onto something. To me, the key point isn't the idea of releasing a steady stream of music instead of an album a year at most -- that's an interesting discussion, but not a new one. Rather, it's asking what music fans will most readily pay for. Debates about serializing music tend to revolve around the artist's creative process, and devolve into arguments between song guys and album guys about the artistic merits of those forms. (Reader caveat: I'm very much a song guy.) But this debate may soon be beside the point: The ideal creative process isn't so ideal if it doesn't get you paid. If consumers won't pay for albums, it behooves artists to find another form.

These songs were worth the wait, particularly the lilting “Late Bloomer” and the up-tempo “In The City.” Harmer’s understated charm is part of her appeal, but fans of intelligent acoustic pop won’t want to overlook this release.

Given that baseball is full of irony, in the ninth inning, Leyland and McClelland had a vigorous face-to-face argument. The dispute arose after Jeff Francoeur doubled off the top of the left-centerfield fence. Centerfielder Austin Jackson reached over the fence and caught the ball before it could land in the bullpen for a homer. Instead of signaling safe to indicate the ball was in play, McClelland mistakenly raised his arm as if to indicate out. Francoeur had rounded second and had stopped running when the ball was thrown back in, and the Tigers tagged him. According to McClelland, Leyland argued that Francoeur should be out.

Duncan and La Russa did not always agree on everything. La Russa certainly overruled Duncan more times than we'd guess. This in no way suggests that Duncan's influence was anything less than extraordinary; he's the

What would be the ramifications of taxing these items? One effect would be that some manufacturers would make their food products more healthy to avoid the tax. That would be a good thing for everyone, and, yes, it could help lower the cost of health care. But not all the junk food will cease to exist. Another effect, and a more likely one, is that the manufacturers will pass the additional cost on to the consumer, not a bad thing since the manufacturers will not have to shoulder the burden, and the people who choose to continue with unhealthy choices would pay an appropriately higher portion of the overall health care costs. What if people stop supporting the manufacturers of unhealthy food? I think we call that "free market," and if the market isn't supported, it will change for the better.

Music videos teem with kama sutra-esque boasting and "is-it-real-or-isn't-it?" displays of bumping and grinding. Video games containing explicit sex scenes have been slapped with lawsuits and other restrictions to prevent them from falling into the hands of joystick-gripping adolescents.
Other schools in the St. Croix Valley will join in similar efforts later this year.
The third neighborhood, in Maplewood, will disappear next year, not because of a flood, but because of plans by Sunnen Manufacturing Co. It is developing 31 acres it has owned for decades into housing, retail and offices.

Everything was great for the Miami Heat until they moved onto the basketball portion of the program.
Then there was a yellow duck, Duckie. Big Bits had an almost paranormal attachment to Duckie. If we lived in a horror movie, Duckie would have persuaded Big Bits to burn down our house or hack us to bits with a chainsaw. Duckie was a good friend though, getting Big Bits through the painful transition from rug rat to preschooler and drying tears as I had to "abandon" him at a very nice preschool where he had fun every day. Looking back and knowing now just how shy our oldest can be, holding on to Duckie was probably the only thing preventing Big Bits from having a screaming fit full of tears and clinging to my legs.

Oh, but wait.
NCAA president Mark Emmert says if the allegations are true, the Miami case proves the need for "serious and fundamental change" in big-time college sports.

Nick said the Whitakers had originally subpoenaed him to appear Feb. 27.
Animal activists, meanwhile, were frustrated and disappointed. One criticized jurors for joking, laughing and sometimes resting their eyes during proceedings.

Personal story: "One day last year I decided to volunteer at Food Outreach, a food pantry that provides groceries to HIV and cancer patients. While I was working, a boisterous woman entered and sat down with one of the grocery lists. After sitting for a bit she came up to the front desk and asked for help, so I went out to the lobby and offered assistance. I quickly learned that the woman could not read or comprehend the grocery list. She asked me to read the items to her so she could choose what groceries she wanted. The woman was very nice and outgoing, and I will always remember her. She has influenced my decision to help people in the future."
But what if Paige woke up and found she was married to someone who looked like, say, Paul Giamatti? That might have offered an intriguing little wrinkle. He loves her fiercely and madly and deeply and all those intense proclamations meant to make the teen girls in the audience swoon. He's willing to fight for her, to help her retrace how they met and what their life together was like in hopes of jogging her memory. He's even prepared to withstand the condescension and disapproval of her wealthy parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange), who wanted her to become a lawyer and from whom she's been estranged all this time. But he looks like Paul Giamatti.

Sure, even now, you may be faced with one of the big relationship-crushing issues like money problems, forcing one of you to call your dad and then go out in the pouring rain to the ATM. But, later in life, when the issue may be which of you stands in the rain with your stuff the sheriff put out on the lawn, the arguing itself isn’t what breaks you up. In fact, it is important to engage and hash out your issues so they don’t burrow in. What seems to matter is how you treat each other when you aren’t disagreeing, in all the seemingly unimportant little moments.
"I do believe it's a good thing," Berea Mayor Cyril Kleem said. "I think this will be a great opportunity for the fair board to teach young people about this type of energy."

Gov. Romney, don't let Reid and other Democrats squelch the debate about immigration.

But the property was empty, save the resident peacocks fanning their feathers as we passed.
