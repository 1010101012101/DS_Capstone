Sardines are a staple of the Ryan family diet along with liverwurst, butter, and Jesus Christ Superstar song lyrics. In related news, none of us are good at sports. Back to the sardines, they were very good but way too many of them. The heads had a nice fatty crunch, the body was light, and the tails were like fish potato chips. I could have made it through the whole plate with a dipping sauce of some sort, but I was outmatched with only lemon to work with.

"Art has always been my salvation. And my gods are Herman Melville, Emily Dickinson, Mozart. I believe in them with all my heart. And When Mozart is playing in my room, I am in conjunction with something that i cannot explain... I don't need to. I know that if there's a purpose for life, it was for me to hear Mozart. Or if i walk in the woods and I see an animal, the purpose of my life was to see that animal. I can recollect it, i can notice it. I'm here to take note of. And that is beyond my ego, beyond anything that belongs to me, an observer, an observer.

Emmaline doesn't give a shit that we're sick! She's not really empathetic or understanding yet so I'm dealing as best I can. Emma still expects me to be on my A-Game. Lots of smiles, throws up in the air, stories, crawling around on the floor together, supporting her hands as she practices walking (yes, we're doing that now!), and basically pretending I'm NOT feeling like crap is how things have been going.

Could you mix this with some hot water, please?" But no, she acted like I was an evil human being, trying to torture her just for the fucking hell of it.

The house is an antique cape. Even though it is a cape, with its beam and post construction and center chimney and back keeping room, it is quite large than is typical, at nearly 3700 square feet. There is an addition on the house that used to be the first school house in a neighboring town, built in the 1700's, but will now act as our master bedroom. Also, a previous owner, lifted the house off its foundation and built a walk-out basement underneath the home, which adds a lot of space. There is also an additional bedroom and bathroom attached to our detached garage, which is exactly what we needed for my husband to run his new company in a room away from the main living space.

Mayer Amschel Rothschild sold the British government German Hessian mercenaries to fight against American Revolutionaries, diverting the proceeds to his brother Nathan in London, where N.M.

Mayer was a serious student of Cabala and launched his fortune on money embezzled from William IX- royal administrator of the Hesse-Kassel region and a prominent Freemason.

They fell backwards, and the fall turned into a twisting, sliding sensation that all but threw the contents of Rel's stomach out of him - he gagged it back down, coughing - and then they were spilling out, upright but stumbling as feet hit the ground and there was a body there.

This is where the story of “A Walk to Remember” by Nicholas Spark revolves. It’s all about falling in love and praying for miracles. Landon Carter, a seventeen year old guy, who never thought would fall in love with Jamie Sullivan. Jamie was a simple, kind-hearted and helpful girl. She was always ready to help whether it is a human being or an animal. Landon always helped Jamie for the sake of humanity. And one day, life changed and everything seems to make sense for him. He was in love with Jamie. So, did he propose Jamie? Jamie accepted his proposal? Some questions should be left unanswered.

If sticking with blogger translates to censorship, a further dumbing-down of the greater dumbdown which incidentally is a major whiplash into absolute slavedom, then the idea of packing up and moving one's blog somewhere else is unnerving to say the least. Who is to say which is worse, staying or leaving? Of course, moving elsewhere can be done, supposedly easily if you buy the hype, but the downside is finding yourself spending infinitely MORE time online than you already do, without the interaction, the discoveries, the visuals and the building on each others spiritual foundations. Moving the blog technically is demanding enough for non-geeks, but the rearrangement of visuals is an unnecessary chore because we've already done it and can't imagine anything more potentially irritating than revising a finished work without the tools we trained ourselves to use developed over many years and through many "supposedly" more efficient ways of doing what we do here. There is a lot more to it than we are being led to believe, deleting the photos Picasa has accumulated in disregard to the fact we have already have offline photo storage and of course, the very big issue of starting all over again with a different email service. I've tried a number of them over the years and found g-mail a lot faster to use, although you don't have any of the graphics choices other email systems provide. And then there is the search feature, too, etc.

He also said then, “Getting naked and running around, or having sex in front of a bunch of people, is such a rush.”.

When I look down the road--two weeks from now when my book goes on sale--what I hope is that people will read my book. Lots of people. I'm hoping, hoping, hoping that it will catch on--that I'll rise in the ranks and word of mouth will spread about this little known YA author and her debut novel. I hope it does well--I believe it CAN do well. However, no matter how hard I try, I can't look down that road and see a fat paycheck in my future. Nope. It just isn't there for me. Perhaps that will change in time...maybe I will eventually focus on the sales/non-sales and the duckets they're earning me. For now, I'm just totally friggin' jazzed about the idea of people reading MY book. For me to gain an audience that just might want to read another.

I know it sounds like I’m a borderline psychotic, but my characters are as real to me as any living breathing subjects of the books I used to ghostwrite. When I was a ghostwriter, each time I took on a project I got to look at the world through a fresh set of eyes. That’s what I love about shuffling my main characters around and introducing new ones. I never write a character and think I’ll use them again in another book. I let the story idea decide who the narrator should be.

The once the new VO graduates, they are in the same business with people who have spent their life as VO artist, with one big difference…$ 10.00 – $ 25.00 commercials. Sure I understand that the minimum wage is around eight bucks an hour, so if it takes 20 minutes to do a spot, wow…that could add up to $ 75.00 an hour. For me, I like the $ 400.00 to $ 1500.00 an hour, and it entails the same work…the same effort, and the same time. The fact is that $ 75.00 an hour is not good if you are only getting 2-3 hours a week is it? And when it’s time to up your fees, what client on you list is going to believe you are worth more than double or triple your fee?

The other day, we were working with a candidate in his search for employment. He is a senior level manager who was recently laid off after many years with the same firm. He came to us because his job search was proving to be unsuccessful. We’ve now had a relationship with this candidate for more than a year. The initial meetings we had with him were spent on re-working his resume and discussing job search strategies. After being employed for so long with the same firm, he’d had no reason to work on his resume (and it showed). It needed a lot of work! After a few months, we found him a contract opportunity for about 6 months. It was a step back in pay and the level of responsibility he is accustomed to, but it was an opportunity to work; and an opportunity to get his foot in the door of a very large corporation. The contract ended after 6 months due to budgetary constraints and the employer was not able to extend the contract or offer him a permanent position. About a month after his contract ended, the employer came back to us to see if the candidate was still available and if he’d be interested in coming back for a few more weeks. When we spoke with the candidate to ask him if he’d be interested in going back for a few more weeks, he’d responded, “No. That work was beneath me and the pay was an embarrasment.” We asked the candidate if he had managed to find work on his own, to which he responded, “No.” He was still unemployed and actively looking for work, but he wasn’t willing to go back to a, “menial job for crap pay.” We promptly informed our client that he was no longer available for that position because he felt he was being underutilized and wasn’t interested interested in returning. Our take is this: There is no shame in work. In this incredibly competitive job search environment, it’s better to be working, than not. And you never know what doors will open when you start any new job. While others might disagree with our opinion on this matter, we think it says a lot about a person’s character when they express things like, “That job is beneath me” or “I’d rather be unemployed and remain on Employment Insurance rather than do that job.” Let’s put it this way: You cannot put “Employment Insurance” on your resume. It adds no value to your experience, but it does say a lot about your character. Going back to the candidate, while we still do maintain a relationship with him, we have to admit that we don’t feel the same level of commitment in assisting him in his job search than we did about a year ago. Being human, we simply don’t feel the same level of confidence in representing him to potential clients. It may not be fair, but it’s the reality.

But one thing overwhelming numbers of Americans do feel is that something is terribly wrong with their country, that its key institutions are controlled by an arrogant elite, that radical change of some kind is long since overdue. They’re right. It’s hard to imagine a political system so systematically corrupt – one where bribery, on every level, has not only been made legal, but soliciting and dispensing bribes has become the full-time occupation of every American politician. The outrage is appropriate. The problem is that up until September 17, the only side of the spectrum willing to propose radical solutions of any sort was the Right.

The other, by contrast, is an inter-dependent world, where each person, regardless of their level of infirmity or disability is loved, cherished, valued and given the very best level of care that money can buy; one where the strong make sacrifices for the weak, where resources are spent on those who most need them, where what I have is yours if you need it, and vice versa.

The point is, if if you ever watch Mario Bava with the sound off just for those great lighting schemes and purple gel spots, you'll love QUEEN OF BLOOD. All the metatextual Russia/Dionysian/Female/Plant/foreign-shot exteriors vs. US/Apollonian/Male/Us interior-shot/mammal dichotomies are just gravy on the train... the GHOST OF MARS train! And Judi Meredith as Laura James. She's got enough black eyeliner to darken the sun, and a sexy smoker's voice. In short, the film would be a great double bill with Josef Von Sternberg's JET PILOT (1957) and is clearly meant for a double bill anyway since it's so short (78 minutes).

When I question what I am doing, the pressure of learning the lines, giving up afternoons and evenings I could be spending with my wife, I just look back at that first time.

Because of the wealth of lectures and free talks he gives/posts around the internet. Say what you will about his writing. His ability to break down stories and characters is fantastic. I love his ability to dish out the information in digestible chunks. He has a fantastic mind for the subject and is a wonderful teacher.
Although the neighbors all spoke of Dr. Hindman’s energy and work around the property, by the time we came along you could tell the house and its owners had aged together. The house sagged in certain places and was overgrown in others. “Entropy” is the word I would later learn to describe what was happening.
I’m a homeschool mom and can see getting a lot of use out of THE GOSPEL STORY BIBLE. My daughter read through a Bible school book in a short time and this book is designed to take slower, a story a day, for the elementary age student. She loved it.

He was enjoying his fag, but was alone so I decided to say “good morning” and give him a big smile… He was a bit dazed but quickly gave me a big smile and “hello there” back. So I decided at that moment to approach the day with a smile on my face and engage people with a simple “hello” if we made eye contact.
SINGAPORE – A greater transparency in healthcare fees is essential for the empowerment of patients and for market forces to work more efficiently, said Minister of Health Gan Kim Yong in Parliament today.

Uh this is my wife's bra suitcase, at least that's what I call it. And she just made me go out to the car to get it. Who does she think she is...Miss Piggy?

You can see that I added some pale yellow highlights to both the milk and the bottle. This is the candlelight reflecting, so it stays yellow, but it is not as strong a yellow as the highlights on his face and arm. Once again, after I add my background I will add some white in with my opaque white to really get the shiny things to look shinier.

I asked what she thought of my house, which I've always seen as a barmy old uncle (perhaps projecting my own personality to the building). "Oh, it's a cheeky nephew," she said. "Its face is a bit dirty at times, but it's one of those nephews that you just have to love. You just roll yours eyes and think: 'bless'."
Pua asked the government to withdraw the WCE contract and reopen it for bidding via an open, competitive tender to ensure the best companies offering the lowest construction prices and the shortest concession period are awarded the contract.
At my last Kaiser Optifast support group meeting, two in the group (a woman from my original “cohort” and a man who was from another group) talked about recent half marathons they had run!

Cruden have recently installed their simulator system into the Universities engineering department, use of the simulator will form the part of the curriculum for the motorsport degree courses. Whereas F1 teams are restricted on the amount of testing they can do, so they use simulators to replace some of the testing. University are budgets restricted, so simulators are a good way to teach students the art & science of driving and race engineering, without having to resort to track testing.
GM: Trams, finance, council tax. Council tax is frozen. The statutory notices are building to be as expensive than the trams – could be £200M. And the cost of the trams is still underestimated – what about restoring the value of the properties on Leith Walk? Enough mistakes have been made. Council tax can’t stay frozen.
So how to have a best seller? Here's the secret, here's the magic formula: The writing always comes first. Let me repeat that. The writing is first, always. ALWAYS. The more you write, the better writer you become. The more you write, the more and better product you have to sell. The more you sell, the more you can cross promote. Etc. This doesn't guarantee a best seller. But the wonderful magic is: you'll be writing. You'll be doing what you love first. And wouldn't that be best?

So God gives Adam a wife, Eve. And when Adam sees her he writes the world’s first poem. “This is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh,” he says. In fact, the creation account of the opening chapters climaxes – awful pun intended – in a wedding, and therefore in a couple having sex, two becoming one.

The acid in her stomach began to crawl into her throat, causing a burning sensation. Nausea rocketed her insides, and the hair on the back of her neck stood up.
Coco, for some reason -- either excitement or a grave balance problem -- couldn't stay in her chair to save her life. She kept falling over backwards and landing with a loud THUD. I reached over and picked her up without skipping a word, all while keeping Lucien on an even keel and fielding questions from his classmates like "Would that dinosaur eat french fries?" and "Lucien's Mommy, can I go do poo-poo?"

I took her aside for a moment before I went home and apologized for not being a good sister when we were small. She acknowledged by saying “That was a long time ago. I have no one to blame but myself now.” We exchanged a glance and I asked her what she was going to do. She said she didn’t know and moreover, she didn’t know what was preventing her from getting traction. I suggested she talk to someone about it. She nodded like she always does and we hugged goodbye.
I am sure there are other types of aftereffects that I am not familiar with, so please educate me!

Jodi’s deadly to the living and even more deadly to the deceased. She has to leave her old, normal life behind before she hurts the people she loves. As if that isn’t difficult enough, Jodi discovers she’s the chosen one who has to save the rest of her kind from perishing at the hands of Hades. If she can’t figure out how to control her power, history will repeat itself, and her race will become extinct.
He never does anything hurtful or violent, but he says pretty crazy things for a 5 year old. I know one thing for sure, he is either going to grow up to be wildly creative and invent the first candy rollercoaster or eventually mass murder a village.

And trying to come up with some kind of image for the cover. Why we couldn't use the American cover - oh, I remember, it was because they thought the American title sounded a bit 'Carry On...' this didn't go down well with the author, who was pompous and humorless, as you'd expect from a man who wrote tedious crime novels about a bishop.
The question "what is that?" is an imposition of meaning from some other viewpoint. "Essence," the "essential nature," is something perspective and already presupposes a multiplicity. At the bottom of it there always lies "what is that for me?" (for us, for all that lives, etc.)

truth without facts
I love the movie Julie & Julia - mainly for Meryl Streep's performance. When the Julie scenes were on I just kept wishing for the Julia scenes to hurry back. My husband and I both used to watch the real Julia Child when we were kids-this movie was very entertaining and made me wish I could have known her!
I asked why he never told me the truth – why I had to specifically ask before he would be honest about it. He said that he was really hoping that we could just forget about it. He echoed my previous statement that we didn’t really deal with things completely back then. He also told me that he doesn’t like thinking about it. I reminded him about what the marriage counselor said about the difference between forgetting and forgiving. And how forgetting is actually really hurtful for the marriage because it doesn’t deal with anything and leaves the door open to the same thing happening again. He said he knows that now.
Still this love goes on.

Drain your jalapeno rosemary potato fritters on paper towels, then serve on a plate while they're hot and crunchy. Enjoy these little bundles of joy with an extra sprinkle of salt and perhaps some freshly ground black pepper. Throw in a dollop of sour cream or yoghurt for good measure. Oh... and you know what else will go with this? A cold beer. Oh yes. Now that would be very nice indeed.

I took a course in Philosophy which started with the earliest of Western Philosophy thinkers, Rene Descartes. You may not know the name, but I'm sure you've all heard of his famous line cogito ergo sum: "I think, therefore I am." The grand idea behind that sentence is that, since we experience everything through our own senses which are highly subjective, we cannot know for certain whether anything beyond our own minds is real or imaginary.
When he returned from his western travels in mid-January, he was still without a place of his own and back in her apartment in Park Slope. He had landed his first or­ganizing job for the New York Public Interest Research Group, a nonprofit founded in the state in 1973 and inspired by the national organization created by citizen activist Ralph Nader. Obama had focused his ambitions on organizing since his last year at Columbia, while acknowledging that he was not entirely certain what it meant. He was hired at a salary that was barely more than half what he had earned at B.I., and his job was to organize students up on the Harlem campus of the City University of New York, focusing on environmental and student-­aid issues.

Well, it’s possible that’s the case (except perhaps for the bit about the end of the world), but if so the editor should be telling you about it. If she isn’t, the difficulties are probably internal to the publisher.
I don’t know when we started calling the noontime meal in Acadiana lunch. I guess lunch is what you eat when you live by a clock, “we have one hour to grab lunch.” Dinner at my grandparent’s house was an event, often with visitors, boisterous laughter and long conversations, with no one looking at their wrist watch to see how much time was left till work started again. Coffee was served after dinner and as the conversations wound down, my grandfather would always head off for his nap.

Anyway, I go upstairs, get my cell and call hubby, but hubby isn’t home so I leave a brief message on the voicemail. And then I try his cell. but don’t get him there either, so I leave another brief message on his cell. And then I call my friend, Vicki, who is very concerned about this situation and keeps urging me to go to the police. I call Vicki, and I’m retelling the entire conversation (much as I’ve done on this blog), and I’m just YELLING in frustration. And I veer from recounting what I said to Rude Neighbor to just a general venting about the neighbor.

Aided by producer and multi-instrumentalist Arnar Guðjónsson (from Leaves), Kalli recorded, performed and produced everything himself on the album.

Crazy, right?
- Malgieri introduced me to a cool technique to keep molded cakes from sticking to the pan: butter the pan, dust it with fine dry bread crumbs, then spray the crumbs with cooking spray. I made my own crumbs from pound cake and corn muffin remnants which I dried in oven then processed in a mini food processor. When I coated the pan with the crumbs, the layer was not precisely even. Since the crumbs were lighter in color than the cake my finished cakes looked a little mottled. Nothing a dusting of confectioner's sugar or a glaze wouldn't fix.
One of our day trips was a road trip through Cape Peninsula, while we tried to explore it and find places without tourists – which was difficult. But we discovered an empty beach with white sand dunes, it was magical. And of course, as is characteristic of the African continent, we saw many animals hanging around.

Now, Derby Day — for our friends beyond the shores of these United States — is the final day of the two-week Kentucky Derby Festival held in Louisville, Kentucky every year.

For too long there has been the sense that while the publishing process is supposed to serve the scientific community, this community has, in fact, been in service to the publishing industry.

THE MOUNTAINS OF KREE
So why were some of Sam's pasties tainted? In one entry for 10th July 1666, he indicates that a pasty made in his kitchen was sent to the bakers - "At noon home to dinner and then to the office; the yarde being very full of women (I believe above three hundred) coming to get money for their husbands and friends that are prisoners in Holland; and they lay clamouring and swearing and cursing us, that my wife and I were afeard to send a venison-pasty that we have for supper to-night to the cook's to be baked, for fear of their offering violence to it: but it went, and no hurt done." So it looks like Mrs Pepys occasionally tried her hand at making them herself. But a venison pasty was more often made by a cook on the estate where the deer had been hunted. A whole boned side was encased in a pastry crust (usually rye paste) so these pasties were very large. When cool they were stored in a larder, where under cold conditions they could keep for months. The thick pastry casing prevented bacteria from entering and causing decay, at least for a while. It was a process equivalent to canning. However, this technique of preservation sometimes failed, as Sam found out to his disgust at Penn's dinners. Pasties were often sent from the country seats where the deer had been hunted, frequently to London, where they were much appreciated as gifts. Some travelled great distances. There are sixteenth century records of these great pasties being sent to France. Sam and his neighbour William Penn probably got hold of them, as well as raw venison meat from noble friends who owned deer parks. Venison was not a meat you could normally buy from a butcher.
He also theorises that new universes could be created by black holes in our universe which are in fact gateways to an entirely new universe. Indeed out universe may be the result of a black hole in another universe.

They were not some sort of prophecy or something to build up anyone else…and so its just not necessary for me to share them. I don’t mind doing it. I just would rather you come to know God yourself and have Him show you things in your own life…your own little miracles.

They captured these moments on pictures and film. This unsettles me on a different level than the physical and mental memories I have. Just knowing that my humiliation and pain is stored somewhere for all to see. Knowing that there are pictures of my rapes, the torture, my tears, my pleases for it to end. For them to stop. I don’t know what these were or are being used for. I can only guess. And guessing makes me sick. Sick with shame. Sick with embarrassment. Simply sick.
Step 2: keep walking and keep calm, because cars adjust their route to it is important that you don’t stop or run.
Cold, wet and definately not what I would wish for on a day during the easter half term. However, the day was brightened up by an early start with blue skies and our lovely girl friend Olivia, one of our daughter’s best friends, has come to stay at our house for a sleep over, something we have owed her for a long while, it is her first ever sleepover at our house, although she has visited many a time she has never slept.

You can also use your trade in as collateral on a car loan by offering them a pink slip as your down payment.

Just outside this shambly hamlet, the highway forks. Where Highway 20 takes off to the right, toward the hinterlands, Highway 34 snakes uphill to the left, into the backwoods. Halfway between here and the ocean, Alsea touts a gas station with pumps that were new in the Fifties, a mercantile that sells bubblegum which was probably fresh when I was kid, and Deb’s, a well attended eatery that, more than likely, has three entreé items: steak, eggs, and potatoes. One hundred sixty-four people were tallied on the 2010 census.
There are a variety of components that constitute a healthy lifestyle. Some of them are very difficult to argue about. There aren’t too many people who would argue about the need to incorporate physical activity and good nutritional choices into your life to help improve your health. No one doubts the negative impact that smoking has on your health anymore, not even the smokers themselves.
Today I've made sure to stick to a smoothie, Ahi tuna salad, & healthy snacks.

7:27 The Jimmy Carter video about New Orleans. This is what he does well. But he has really hurt his image with his perceived criticism of Israel. Is that why they did the video but he wasn’t allowed to speak?
So things are very good. It’s beyond satisfying to get all these scenes down that I’ve been imagining over some months as I walk or try to fall asleep or hear a line in a song that triggers something. The story is wrapping together into something I would never have thought I could write. I can only recall going through so much improvement, but it was happening even when I wasn’t putting effort into it. I give all the unconscious credit to reading, to loving stories and being able to identify what it is that I love, and what I wish were different. What I want to imitate and avoid. Whenever my friends rant about something they hate in books, I listen and file it all away. I eavesdrop in bookstores to hear what people are talking about. I’m not trying to write a perfect book (especially since I want to write books, plural), but it’s all stuff cycling around in my brain as I write, as I make choices on the fly. I write with spell-check off; in notebooks I ignore margins. There’s stuff I know is bad as I’m writing it, but that’s not what this draft is about. It’s about getting the story down, and later I can tinker with the presentation.

One more silly video. This one is from Portland. I think this proves they’re working too hard to prove they’re weird out there. Or maybe “Portlandia” has gone to their heads. True weirdness should come naturally, like a flower blooming or a bird singing. If you have to don three weird tropes in order to make your point, you’re trying much too hard.
There might be various causes that creates the opportunity for parallel situations. It might relate to age, like young adults coming of age, sharing the same or similar experiences for the first time.
“I was a bit surprised because defenders don’t normally get these awards and get the limelight as much as the centre-forwards. If you look at the people I was in with then it is a great honour to get the award and hopefully there is more to come. It is always an honour to be selected by the people you play against and, like I say, hopefully I can get a few more of these and some medals with Tottenham along the way.”
It looks like Jesus made our approach to evangelism clear...go into all the world and preach the gospel, right? But what does that mean? Is that someone on a megaphone at a ballpark or a convention center or a policy building telling people they are going to hell? Is that a shrewd strategy devised to manufacture a "repeat after me" type of prayer moment? Is it proper memorization of scripture to make a good point for the lostness of man and the need for a Savior? While some of these may be effective in producing decisions from time to time, they are not the model Jesus used. Jesus told people about the kingdom of God, He demonstrated the kingdom of God, and people were drawn to His message. Most were drawn to Him, not because they wanted fire insurance for someday down the road, but because His life was such a clear example of who God is. They wanted to shine the way that He did. And through His obedience, what did His life say about God? Jesus went about doing good, healing all who were oppressed of the devil. Wow. So Jesus, as a person, confirmed to us that if God was walking around on earth, He would be relieving people of their oppression, healing their disease, and teaching them how to live a better life today...a life that aligns us with the favor of God through surrender and obedience.
I think it is genius that Those Darlins and Best Coast are touring together. They are both boss groups with strong female leads. Though they are not all girl (like The Coathangers) you still get a really strong sense of female empowerment by listening to and watching these female musicians.

If you know me at all, from personal experience or just from my writings, you might be a bit surprised to know that when I was a kid I was considered bookish, uninterested in athletics, a bit nerdy. I distinctly remember being pushed to close whatever book I was quietly reading, and to go outside and play ‘like a real boy’.
Leap year, also known as intercalary day was created by Julius Caesar in 45 BC! It occurs just about every four years. (certain years it does not). Since the earth completes it's orbit around the sun in 365 1/4 days, leap year is a way to sync the calendar year with the solar year.

“The NDAA implodes our most cherished constitutional protections. It permits the military to function on U.S. soil as a civilian law enforcement agency. It authorizes the executive branch to order the military to selectively suspend due process and habeas corpus for citizens. The law can be used to detain people deemed threats to national security, including dissidents whose rights were once protected under the First Amendment, and hold them until what is termed “the end of the hostilities.” Even the name itself—the Homeland Battlefield Bill—suggests the totalitarian concept that endless war has to be waged within “the homeland” against internal enemies as well as foreign enemies.“

The logic is simple: “You are clan.” In fact, for clan, if there is one thing that I expect, it is that one doesn’t say “thank you”.

The jet lag has certainly hit me harder this time, I’m not quite sure why. Possibly because my routine was thrown out on the way across, and its never recovered, or maybe its just that I’m getting too old for trying to jump 8 time zones in one long haul? Not a problem I plan to worry about for a while at least, the next few will be nearly all 5, with one 6 thrown in for good measure, which might just be in Kansas lol!

Located on the lower ranges of the Himalayas, Shimla is a hill station that experiences extreme climatic conditions. It is situated at a height of around 2214 meters above sea level. This altitude gives Shimla its diverse climatic conditions.

While category leader Jubilant FoodWorks’ promoted Domino’s Pizza is aggressively pushing its ‘pizza mania’ umbrella priced at Rs 39, home-grown Pizza Corner has launched a pilot ‘my pizza’ range in Bangalore with prices starting at Rs 38 for a 7-inch pizza each. And US chain Papa John is not ruling out dropping entry-level prices. “Access to a wider base of consumers and driving volumes further is what led us to launch the new range,” says Sandeep Kataria, chief marketing officer at Yum! Restaurants India. Pizza Hut has positioned its latest offering as a ‘snacking option’ rather than a full-meal.

Which was very quickly replenished by my little bird lover.

Lots of action, excitement, gunplay and car chases--just like in the original. A mysterious killing machine pushing a would-be victim too far--just like in the original. In fact, it's pretty much just like the original except for the cast...and quality. It's not a bad film. In fact, it's still rather enjoyable, in a time-wasting sort of way. It's just a shame that the filmmakers couldn't have brought SOMETHING new to the table, or at least give some viable explanation for the same thing happening all over again. Sheer laziness on their part, even more so than just making a full-fledged reboot. At least then you have the balls to own up to your unoriginality.

Since that day, apart from emptying the ashtrays of visiting friends who still smoke, I have not touched a cigarette, a fact which surprises me even more than it surprises those who know me.

My dad is an incredibly hard worker.

He is a self made man who is as selfless as they come. I've learned, and continue to learn, a lot from watching how he works, lives, listens, loves, and smiles through just about anything.

This time the deboarding was not barefoot. We landed in a thick young forest on the slope of the mountains. The idea was to move a bit down the Alatna river and then turn left towards the Arrigetch peaks. This involved a bit of heavy bushwhacking and walking on tussock. It was slow progress, good thing we didn’t have to worry about walking in the dark. However, to make things worth it started raining again, the group also wasn’t acclimatized to backpacking (well, yes, we were all experienced, sure, but no matter what the first day (and the day after) are always difficult). I personally had my stupid eye+head ache. Funny it always comes up at the beginning of long trips (aside from other cases of unknown origin). All of this didn’t make the going enjoyable, for everyone. In retrospect it seem to have discouraged our leader from pushing the group to what it is really capable. Eventually we broke the camp at some flatish point that was relatively clear of trees and large bushes. It didn’t matter much to me. Sorry, guys, but I just wanted to sleep off that headache.

I'm thinking about setting up a pool. The litter is due somewhere around the last week of October, a few days before Hallo'een for certain. We've already decided on a Hallo'een litter name, and have compiled long lists of names for individual pups. There's even several VIPs in the Borzoi world who have dibs, which I have to say is awfully flattering. The thing being, there's not fifteen of them waiting in line! So me, what I'm thinking about doing is setting up a pool: guess how many pups there will be, and the birthday. Get it right and you get a puppy. Heck, get it CLOSE and you get a puppy. *lol*

As of lately I struggle with our persistently and increasingly declining personal economy, trying to keep two homes, one close to unsellable.

After World War II, Wohlstetter moved to Southern California, and his wife Roberta began work on her pathbreaking RAND study, Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision (1962), exploring why the U.S. had missed all the signs that a Japanese “surprise attack” was imminent. In 1951, he was recruited by Charles Hitch for RAND’s Mathematics Division, where he worked on methodological studies in mathematical logic until Hitch posed a question to him: “How should you base the Strategic Air Command?”

In research investigating the modern man, James Donald, agrees with Lacan’s theory that their is nothing behind the image; it is not the case that beneath these layers, a ‘true’ or ‘real’ person is hiding. However, he suggests that: ‘This nothing is once again the necessary nothing we keep coming up against, the abstraction that is the subject, the empty place that makes appearance, conduct and consciousness possible. Being a citizen, being a man about town, being a person – these are not identities, they are performances.’ (Donald, 2000).

parents coming home to find their child lying on the floor in a fetal position crying hysterically after being expelled from school, students attempting to defend themselves of false charges made by the FCS administration only to be declared liars, students facing suspension/expulsion for charges that are never proven, students being expelled over the phone, students hammered with Psalms and called prostitutes by a leadership bent on shaming with unproven accusations of sexual sin, students struggling with depression, and students given little or no opportunity for defense. One parent called this school year a "blood bath" when she referred to the six students who have been indefinitely suspended/expelled in the last few months alone.

Sooooooo....we finish up and walk out to the lot. I think I mentioned that this place was HUGE...I'm not exagerating (sp?). We walk and he's stopping to take pictures of all the older RV's while I'm shivering behind him. We get to this one that he had seen on the website and he is excitedly walking around it snapping pictures while I'm standing between two RV's trying to keep the wind from blowing me away. (I'm a big girl so it tells u how windy it would have to be to blow me away). He tells me to go back to the car and wait and he'll meet me there later. So without further ado, I shivered my way back to the car.

The Black Swan stood in a pocket of decaying village, the dirty speck round which the pearly suburb had woven itself. The village had shrunk to less than an acre. It was like a tiny reservation for aborigines. From the filthy windows imbeciles leered down at the weed-patches; cocks crowed all day; little girls in pinafores of an earlier age shnockled over stained half-eaten apples; all the boys seemed to have cleft paletes. Probably unknown to Burgess, Sanvey Lane in Aylestone was formerly called Mad Lane.

For a lot of us homemakers, our grocery bill is the easiest area to save money in. Any college student can tell you that Ramen noodles, bologna, and peanut butter will fill you up and save some cash, but when you are feeding a family you need a little more variety than that. One of our favorite go to frugal meals is chicken and rice. Not only is it frugal and filling, it makes a lot and is easy to clean up afterwards. We can usually eat for two or three days off a pot of chicken and rice. Even my somewhat picky husband doesn’t complain about leftovers if its this dish!

performed on stage last century by actor Richard Burton and luckily for those of us who care, the performance was transformed into a movie Doctor Faustus (1967), directed by Richard Burton and Nevil Coghill. That theatrical performance will remain a treat for anyone who loves good theatre. (This critic, while a college student, saw that film in 1972 in a near empty commercial movie hall in Thyagaraja Nagar, Chennai, India.) It was the only work that Burton ever directed but he was able to capture and distil the finest elements of good theatre with visual finesse and magical eloquence on film for posterity. Marlowe’s Faustus was a German scholar in Wittenburg, who having learnt everything in conventional academia yearns for more, especially the dark arts, and signs a pact with the devil (Mephistopheles) to sell his soul if he gets knowledge beyond conventional academics, power over knights and courtiers of Charles V, and the carnal pleasures resulting from the company of Helen of Troy (Elizabeth Taylor plays the cameo part in the film) for a period of 24 years. Marlowe’s Faustus later repents that he will be deprived of the pleasures of heaven but the devil wins the philosophical joust at the end.

The premise is pretty simple – everyone is primarily dominant in one or two of the five love languages. The five love languages are: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch. My primary love languages are Quality Time and Acts of Service. My husband is Words of Affirmation and Physical Touch. The book explains each of these and how to better understand someone who has a different love language than you. It’s very simple, but not something people tend to pick up on their own.
Sure, we had traveled to all the same places, had seen all the same things, had gone on all the same tours and walked through the same foreign streets, but with every single trip we made, my perception of our travels was as different to hers as an apple is different to an elephant. She saw everything through the eyes of an FCK expatriate, a woman traveling the world with her family, always far away from home and the world she grew up in. She always had that stability, that memory of a lifetime of growth and development in a constant environment. She had memories of meeting her husband, my father, back in the UK, of getting married there with both sides of the family only an hour away from each other at most. She remembers bringing two children into the world there, the first few years of our lives spent in that home that she had always known. And then she remembers leaving home, and always missing home, and always going back home to see the people she loved and grew up with.

My mother, who is post-menopausal, had an endometrial biopsy this week. An ultrasound showed her lining was really thick, which just shouldn't happen at her age. Best case scenario it's endometrial hyperplasia, which means a hysterectomy, because cancer will eventually start to grow. At worst, it's endometrial cancer. Soooo....we get the results this week, and any way you slice it, she'll have to have the surgery.

What's up with that? I get easily discouraged and I'm so tempted to throw in the towel on this dress. I love sewing, I really do, but I freaking hate not getting it right and I have no patience to fix stuff. I'll post some pictures later so you see what the effer looks like.

Many years ago, I had a pretty dull job in a pretty fine organisation. There was nothing glamorous about my daily tasks - I filed, I typed, I managed databases and dealt with insurance claims, but my employers had a strong sense of history and a long presence in London. They owned a box at the Royal Albert Hall and for every single concert, any tickets that weren't wanted by the Governors, were made available to staff in a raffle. Once a month it was my job to organise that raffle and distribute the tickets amongst my colleagues. It was by far and away the most enjoyable task I've ever been employed to do. I loved the sense of anticipation as staff waited to see the list of winners posted up, and I loved the look of delight as I handed over the tickets to the lucky winners.

I admit there are parts that are too political for my taste, but I got what Orwell is trying to say. I even agree with him a couple of times. On the other hand, the dystopian world he created for Winston and Julia to live in… my, it was subtly frightening. It was riddled with animosity (kids turning over their parents to the Thought Police), fanatic idealism (O’Brien), and perverted conversion (you will love Big Brother).

The first row design goes live on Tuesday,July 5th and we’ll have another one each Monday after that for the next four weeks. Start collecting a nice background fabric and a pile of focus fabrics. You probably need about 3 yards of background fabric, more if you decide to make a bigger quilt. And then some focus fabrics (I obviously used fat quarters!). Someone used yardage of their favorite designer, another used a layer cake, and another used up a bunch of her adorable scraps in an attempt to further d-stash.
The madam is surprised that this ordinary looking man has asked for something so outrageous that her two girls will have nothing to do with him.

In short, it is about how and where fashion and fabric are made. I had a general idea how it works, but this book describes the details – and boy, I’d say I had no idea… I think it should be obligatory lecture at school. Maybe then people would think twice before buying a lot of (cheap) stuff.

Do you ever have those days (or weeks or months) where you feel like everything's going non-stop and you're so busy that you can't take a deep breath ... yet it doesn't sound like all that much was going on when you try to explain it to someone else? I can probably sum it all up by saying, I have children.
Neither the Athenian narcissus, nor the Lacedaemonian hyacinth, nor the crocus was from the beginning a flower; and neither child Hylas in Thrace, nor the cypress tree in Crete, nor the daphne was from the beginning a plant. But Krocus was a Sicilian lad, child Hylas was a beautiful Thracian, and Kyparissos was a beautiful boy. Daphne was a young virgin maiden, daughter of the river, Narcissus was a beautiful Boetian boy, and Hyakinthos was a young Spartan man in the bloom of his youth. Herakles had Hylas, and Dionysos took him. Krokus joined Dionysos in his Bacchic revels. Nymphs seized Narcissus, and Apollon took Hyakinthos and Daphne. Nymphs killed Krokus, nymphs carried away Hylas, Kyparissos threw himself down from rocks and the earth received Daphne when she was fleeing. Narcissus in his arrogance loving himself like another killed himself. Only one flower, the flower of Antinous, is sweeter than all by far, not pale like the narcissus, pained by his taking; and not pale like the hyacinth, imitating the color of a corpse. Someone will gather garlands of lamented names, and will lament more the youth of the dying men.

We are, I think, too disposed to think of a "conscience vote" as a way of legitimating dissenters, while ignoring their preferences: here, absolving certain pious MSPs - and particularly, ministers - from the embarrassing and politically damaging burdens of rebellion against a government policy which they may vigorously dissent from. What this conception doesn't appreciate - or prime us for - is enacting legislation where conscience isn't a preserve of the defeated minority, but sets everyone free to follow their agendas, freely advocate their preferences and lodge counter-proposals. It is all very well to ask Salmond questions about the precise shape of the government Bill - but if most MSPs will be free to follow their own lights in formulating the final text, ministerial preferences are just a very starting starting point.

The horror of the weekend began on Friday 29th April 1994, when in the first official qualifying session, the young Brazilian Rubens Barrichello lost control of his Jordan Hart car approaching the quick Variante Bassa chicane. His car launched off a kerb and smashed into the tyre wall at colossal speed, narrowly avoiding going over some catch fencing. Only the quick reactions of Professor Sid Watkins prevented the talented Barrichello, second in the drivers championship at the time from swallowing his tongue. Remarkably he walked away with just a cut lip, minor bruising and a broken nose. His weekend was over but his life had remained intact. It reminded Grand Prix fans and drivers of the real dangers that the sport possesses. Just 24 hours later, the luck ran out.

This morning was busy – 10 rooms to clean and tidy, with rather a few total changeovers. We had a number of guests leaving us today, including a lovely Japanese girl who was taking a quick break with us before heading back to Edinburgh to continue her studies. She popped into the lounge yesterday and sat with me, chatting about this and that regarding her life in Japan and Edinburgh. I really appreciated her taking the time to share a little of her experiences with me and wished that we had more time together to get to know each other properly.

There is still time to “get on the ark” of God. There is still time to let the refuge of lies be swept away from our hearts and to enter into the true refuge from the day to come. Jesus is still calling men and women today, boys and girls, to repent- to turn away from all sin and wickedness; to have all their past sins washed away by his blood atonement he shed on the cross; and to be given a new spirit- a spirit of true righteousness and holiness- the Spirit of Christ.

I haven't even talked about history. Which is probably a good thing. One thing on my bucket list is to learn some more history. Not that it is always an exact science but it does bring some context. George Washington chopped down the cherry tree, right? History changes....which used to bug the crap out of me as a kid. Teachers would get their panties in a bunch as if history was like the multiplication tables, immutable and unchangeable.

After a one line of dialog and a snap of fingers, we see Carly, the star of the show. She seems okay and well-behaved. What could she be doing in the principal’s office? Oh, she set some flyers around school. Nothing too major… Why is Miss Briggs so mad? Oh, we can see that now. Apparently, someone has edited a picture of a rhinoceros and added her face to it. Yeah, I’d be mad too. Then, Ms. Briggs suggests that Carly’s father is made aware of this situation. We find out that he can’t, because he’s part of the armed forces (military) but Carly suggests Spencer, her brother and legal guardian, who apparently is an artist. Principal Franklin states there is no need for Spencer to be informed and gives Ms. Briggs permission to come up with a punishment fitting for her act. She has an amazing idea which will benefit… her. She is forcing Carly to record the auditions for the talent show. She complains but is ignored. And is almost thrown out of the room.

If you are like most people, the answer is likely to be, “it depends.” What it depends on, a recent study found, is not whether the position that scientist takes is consistent with the one endorsed by a National Academy. Instead, it is likely to depend on whether the position the scientist takes is consistent with the one believed by most people who share your cultural values.

The essence of film ILSA: SHE WOLF OF THE S.S. (1975) will always be that of character actress Dyanne Thorne. Dyanne is a glowing, raving actress that brings a dangerousness to the ILSA role all the while a sexual ambiguity. The character is cruel, seductive, painful, beautiful and all the while deadly. Dyanne Thorne would go on to play this character of ILSA again in following sequels, ILSA: THE HAREM KEEPER OF THE OIL-SHEIKS (1976) and ILSA: TIGRESS OF SIBERIA (1977). These are exploitation classics, that everyone out there in Mondo Video land needs to experience at least once.

Israel tends to take risks for peace when it believes the chance for peace is credible and when it senses a fair international climate. Israel withdrew from the Sinai desert — which is three times the size of Israel and which provided it with strategic protection — because Egyptian President Anwar Sadat convinced the Israeli public he was serious about peace. And when Eastern European and many Third World countries established diplomatic relations with Israel following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Israel responded with an overture to the Palestine Liberation Organization that became the Oslo process.

I don't have the money to do something so neat but, my family helps these guys out in any way that we can and one of the ways I'm going to share with you now. As I've mentioned before, I'm not the crocheter in the family so, the directions I share come from my mom. So, if you've got a question, by all means ask and I'll ask her to clarify! :)
The second combat mission introduces you to the Strider class which is more aligned with an Archer or Ranger. You have two daggers and a bow which is really easy to use and fire arrows. While the Fighter felt slower and more methodical, the Strider class plays completely differently, relying more on speed than raw power. I enjoyed this class much more than the Fighter. The mage in your party will also typically imbue your weapons with fire which really helps against the boss fight with the swooping Griffin. Being in an open field, the Griffin typically took to the skies and swooped down on my party. With the fire arrows however, I was able to set its wings on fire and cause it to come burning down to the ground. At this point, it’s a ground war and the game even lets you climb the beast and hack away at it. Combat felt smoother in this mission than it did in the other one, but still didn’t do anything too different from a normal third person action game.

And maybe, maybe I'll believe
The author also sites Robert Jewett’s proposal “that these preachers who compete with Paul were itinerants, who believe that valid apostles should exhibit extraordinary phenomena such as having ecstatic visions and working miracles” (p. 15). This is only one of four traditional criteria of a genuine apostle. Cousar lays out the basic characteristics of Paul’s opponents; however, he doesn’t go into the popular identities and philosophical details about them. For this commentary series, it is enough.
The Geneva Bible was a good scholarly work using original Roman type, smaller fonts, and the familiar verse formats of today's Bibles and highlighting particular words to show where they had been added to the original for emphasis. The Geneva Bible was in general use for over 60 years and was the Bible quoted by playwrights such as William Shakespeare. The Geneva Bible was the first to bring out a "pocket book" edition of the Bible that people could carry around with them more easily than the traditional large formats produced for public reading in church services.

The girls and I painted them after I'd glued them with a non-toxic hot glue. I'm proud to say I never burnt myself! :) (Yes. Burning myself with the glue gun happens a lot. For some reason I'm always getting the molten lava they call glue on my fingers. And, I can attest it's not toxic 'cause any time I hurt my fingers right into my mouth they go. There isn't any ill effects like double vision or double vision or anything. ;) ) Sunshine globbing the paint on is where I got the idea for my little nativity sets shepards hair. I have to say she still did a better job of keeping herself clean than I did. Paint's like a magnet to me. I just get covered in it.

The telephone chimed every ten minutes and messages added up. Starting at six-thirty in the morning, people remembered my birthday. Before even emerging from the tent over her bed, Ladybug’s first words were a morning-whispered "happy birthday mommy” as I laid her school uniform out for the day. I turned on the radio in the kitchen and poured cereal and heated water for oatmeal. I cut the crusts off a ham and cheese before putting it in the lunchbox with something chocolate (gasp). Two wishes I rarely grant for the first-grader.
We needed something else though something that would be melty like the chocolate bar and these Ghirardelli white chocolate squares were perfect!:)
But I've always wanted to go. It makes me think of big, blonde hair, nice tans and lots of sparkles. It's amusing how we have misconceptions about other parts of our own country. For example, I met some kids from Alaska and I was actually shocked they did not live in igloos. Ok, so that was back in high school, but you know what I mean.

Tobias watched his hands shake, considering again the dread he felt facing the forge. His breath steamed in the crystalline air of an early winter. The cold outside sent sluggish spikes of pain through his belly, belying the intense heat of the almost white-hot coal. The smith picked up his hammer and tongs, spitting into the blaze.

Though it feels weird to be with my family in Colorado while my friends are starting classes at UW, I can’t wait to get to Paris! Acquiring a visa for my trip was quite a process (I had to fly to the French consulate for the West Coast in San Francisco during finals week!), but totally worth it. Next time you hear from me I’ll be moved in to my new home for the next few months!
Here you go...
T.A.'s mom and I spent a rather intense afternoon in talking about possibilities, making decisions and choices. We rearranged rooms, moved accessories to different places, re-oriented the focus of some rooms. After we did as much as we could with what she had, we decided to go shopping for a few things to help update the house. We didn't spend a lot, but we did buy a couple of lamps, some colorful new towels, a coffee table to replace a wicker piece that wasn't working and so on. There had been a small extra refrigerator sitting in the laundry room, but it wasn't really very workable in the space and it didn't provide very much extra cooling space, so it went out into the garage.
The way I see it, there are two morals to this story.

It doesn’t really take much to be supportive of the rights of gays and lesbians to marry. It’s just, well, the right thing to do.
This episode was about innovation, and how! Innovation was tackled at three different scales, the personal, the organizational, and the social. It started with Nikai, a second stringer who makes a difficult decision to do what is best for the team, even though it comes with a personal price. The process we witness of Nikai coming to his decision is told with both reason and emotion. Many shows would build an entire episode around such a story, and lesser shows have milked similar stories for multiple episodes, but this is only the first of three types of innovation that were depicted in this very interesting episode.

So, when I was governor, I fought for — actually, before I was governor, I fought for, during my election and thereafter, a program to have English immersion in our schools so our kids could learn in English. I think we agree on this, which is, you know what? Kids in this country should learn English so they can have all the jobs and all the opportunity of people who are here.
The most exciting thing about the win is that the Union finished it with nine men on the field. Keon Daniel and Gabriel Farfan were both sent off for rough tackles in the second half. Zac MacMath the Union Defense deserve a lot of credit for holding on to the narrow lead. They extended the Union’s clean sheet streak to 332 minutes, more than three and a half games.
There were so many big changes for several of the characters in this addition to the series. They make me curious as to where the next book will lead. I want to learn more about Emma's future and what it will mean for Suzanne's shop. While I saw George's twist coming, I'm intrigued to see how it will change the books.

The first thing they did was to tear out the kitchen. The entire family helped with the demolition (minus me and my man...sad day, but we live in Tennessee so its hard to make it up for every thing, but we were certainly there in spirit)!

Hands down, this is the BEST smelling Kona coffee body scrub I've ever come across. About 10 years ago I used a Kona coffee body scrub and was head-over-heels in love with it. Then it was discontinued and my search for a new coffee scrub began. I have tried to find the best replacement but haven't had luck... until I discovered Kohana's Kona Coffee Body Polish; smells very authentic!

So was Gaga Rouge worth spending more than my absolute upper limit for affordable wines (if only by $.10)? In my opinion, probably not. It is a good wine, but I prefer California red table wines such as the Coppola Rosso or the Big House Red, which cost less and taste better, in my opinion.

I watched videos of my children. My son Noah being born, my older one meeting him for the first time, birthday parties, the first time they rolled over. They were all such precious memories and parts of the puzzle of my love for my children. Wipe them all away and the love is gone. Or is it? This is still the question. Is love strong enough to prevail?

And when Jesus was five years old, there fell a great rain upon the earth, and the boy Jesus walked up and down through it. And there was a terrible rain, and He collected it into a fish-pond, and ordered it by His word to become clear. And immediately it became so. Again He took of the clay which was of that fish-pond, and made of it to the number of twelve sparrows. And it was the Sabbath when Jesus did this among the boys of the Jews. And the boys of the Jews went away, and said to Joseph His father: Behold, thy son was playing along with us, and he took clay and made sparrows, which it was not lawful to do on the Sabbath; and he has broken it. And Joseph went away to the boy Jesus, and said to Him: Why hast thou done this, which it was not lawful to do on the Sabbath? And Jesus opened His hands, and ordered the sparrows, saying: Go up into the air, and fly; nobody shall kill you. And they flew, and began to cry out, and praise God Almighty.
Friday I was feeling like me again. So in the afternoon I took my kids to the Children's Museum. Even though they were not the best kids ever I felt awful that E's spring break was spent at home with a sick Mommy. I had to get her out of the house to do some thing!
Most people, when hearing of my life experiences say, “Oh my, what a tragic life!” I do not see it that way at all. I am the eternal optimist, and idealist to the core. I love my life, and finally knowing who I am, I love myself. I spent a lifetime trying like crazy, until it made me crazy, to conform to some elusive standard of normalcy, or perfection, or success, and I never quite got it. Now, I honor myself, and my heart and soul. And suddenly, because of that one big change, I find that I am no longer just surviving, I am thriving!
Birdwood was settled in 1840 by persecuted Lutherans from Prussia/Germany. At first the village was called Blumberg but the name was changed during WW1 due to anti German sentiment and was named Birdwood after the commander of the ANZAC troops at Gallipoli.

The writers of the movie did a great job of capturing the spirit of the characters literary persona and yes the hijinks are outlandish in an Indiana Jones sort of way but my entire gang, found the film to me a very entertaining family adventure worthy of the price of admission.
"SHEER TERROR"? Under a bright white sky? Maybe, but a show of hands first: who can tell me what's missing in this picture? No, not a printed promise of anti-Jaws film quality. No, not the artist trying to lull people into a false sense of security by reminding them of Goldfinger. Can't get it? Look at the surface of the water. See that waving hand? Unless Lurch finally got tired of Thing's emo crap and flung him into the ocean, or the shark just took a huge chomp of 99% of this drowning victim, I'd say we have a serious physicality problem with this Roy Scheider cameo, here.

It is a prayer for all seasons. We will always have reason to pray this, because our sin-riddled flesh will always have reason to squirm and say: I’m not willing to receive what You give! I don’t want Your gifts. I want what You haven’t given me (why don’t You give me what I want?). I’m going to hold on to whatever You’re taking, because it’s all I know.
To say I’ve walked through this situation with complete peace would be a lie. I have heard The Lord tell me “Be still and know that I am God” Psalm 46:10, but hearing and doing are two different things.

Why might you dislike this situation? It’s fairly obvious: by accepting the hamper deal you have lost your control over what you buy from the supermarket, and once you are in the habit of buying their hampers, they can raise prices in the knowledge that your other options — buy just a few very expensive items individually or stop using the supermarket altogether — are unattractive to you.

When I went to Costco, I found another bargain, Organic Quinoa, 4 lbs for $9.99. This is a real good deal . because some places, it is almost $4 per lb. I was anxious to make something with the quinoa, and we needed a side dish for our jalapeno chicken sausages. I remembered Kim@LivLife, and herQuinoa Salad with Avocado, Black Beans and Chipotle Lime Dressing but I didn't have all of the ingredients. Then I saw this very versatile recipe on the quinoa bag for Summer Quinoa Salad. The salad uses cooked quinoa with a variety of vegetables, fruits, and herbs, any that you might have on hand.

In those times when I didn’t receive a promotion, didn’t get a high mark on my test and didn’t hear a thank you for my hard work: I felt like shit. I was negative and embarrassed to face people. I beat myself up over and over. I envied others that were better than me. Life didn’t feel so loving.

The Massively preview that I referenced last time I wrote about Allods Online has perhaps more than I really have to offer, so I would suggest that as a starting point. I do have some screenshots that I wanted to chime in about (out of 173… I take a lot of shots).
The first building planned is The Londoner, a 5-storey apartment building commemorating the Olympic Games in London 2012 with 35 units, located on the seafront, adjacent to the existing reception building.

When a tough detective (played by human comic-book drawing Luc Merenda) reaches the end of his fuse, the explosion takes out half of the Italian underworld, and quite a few innocent bystanders. Director Sergio Martino and screenwriter Ernest Gastaldi appear to have taken it upon themselves to trump the Dirty Harry movies with even more extra-legal police mayhem and rights-trampling. And just as Merenda’s rampage violates all the tenets of human decency, Gastaldi’s scenario violates all the laws of probability. As in many of Gastaldi’s celebrated giallo scripts, the story turns on the most bizarre coincidences. Also, Merenda’s idea of investigational procedure is, brutality aside, surreal in the extreme. He essentially turns into a pool-hustling, pimping bad guy to stalk his quarry and in that guise commits much more crime than he could ever hope to prevent. He genuinely becomes Milan’s public health menace number one. It’s odd but it’s also a lot of fun. Plus, the De Angelis brothers provide one of their best “harsh ‘70s reality” scores. Pow! (Lars)

I learned a lot from teaching the class. It was actually very helpful to discuss areas of children’s writing which I’d never tried myself - fantasy, say, or picture books. I also realised how important it was to step away from formal ‘how to’ teaching, and give students the chance to talk about how writing made them feel vulnerable and nervous. That’s why writing exercises were important. They force you to come up with instant ideas, which often aren’t great - how can they be after ten minutes thought? At first everyone was striving for excellence, for a polished finished product. Then gradually they realised that the whole point of writing in class was to show that getting started doesn’t have to be perfect, it can’t possibly be polished, but it is possible in an hour to go from a blank mind and page to the start of something that might grow. That's what I'm going to try and explain to my students right at the start of term this time. I still feel bad about the lady who never came back.

This is Mermaid Street - very quaint and picturesque with its cobbles and mix of medieval timber-framed inns and elegant Georgian houses. The Mermaid Inn, seen here, is one of the oldest buildings in Rye and has a long and turbulent history, with tales of sieges, ghosts and fugitives. The foundations and cellars are of Norman construction but as with most of Rye the building was burned to the ground by the French in 1377, with only the cellars surviving. It was rebuilt to its current form in 1420.
Well, wasn’t that obvious? Some 81-year-old’s can’t be trusted to make toast without the risk of setting their houses on fire, let alone run a media conglomerate that’s starting to become a little too big for its boots. It would seem that Murdoch’s previous attempts at playing the poor old man have worn off with MPs (primarily Labour and, slightly surprisingly, LibDem’s). They finally realised that instead of remaining totally innocent in the matter, Murdoch was ‘wilfully blind’ towards the conduct of his English newspapers, primarily, the News Of The World.

My colleague, Alexis, just informed me of an upcoming presentation dealing with the development of the Japanese microbrewery industry. It will be given in English and should be informative for those interested in Japanese business, policy studies, and ... of course, good beer. The CEO of COEDO Beer will provide beer for sampling after the presentation.

So yummy, so light, and so easy! I'm making this today because I've decided I'm going to "detox" this weekend. I traveled last week for work, so I ate a lot of restaurant food. This weekend, I'm going to eat mostly vegetarian and completely healthy. I had 2 cups of green tea and steel cut oats for breakfast. The broccoli soup and a salad will be lunch, plus I have some veggie chili I made as well.

Yes, I know, I am late to post. You see, I made these cupcakes last Friday but life became crazy with a teething baby, guests coming into town, a teething baby, baptismal classes, and a teething baby. So, I didn't get a chance to post. But, I am here now. I might be sleep-deprived and have a six-month-old creature sleeping on me, but I am here. Better late than never, right?

Romney believes that long-term productivity can be achieved only through continual innovation. He quotes from Alan Greenspan, “Creative destruction – the scrapping of old technologies and old ways of doing things for the new – is the only way to increase productivity and therefore the only way to raise average living standards on a sustained basis.” Unfortunately, innovation causes hardship to some, and this causes well-intentioned people to resist innovation. Business and unions continually petition the government to protect them against new competitors who have innovated. Romney’s advice to the government is – “the most important thing government can do to promote innovation and productivity is to not block it, as by preventing creative destruction.” But Romney wants to ameliorate the localized harm caused by creative destruction – “For all the benefits that productivity improvements bestow on the many, we need to make sure that the cost is not borne by the few…. As a nation we must do everything we can imagine to help the affected people transition to new and productive employment.”

I will be living with my best friend from home, but recently we’ve been getting in little tiffs. I hope everything works out.

Spiritual paths and teachings give us access to the tools and guidance to do this inner work. For example, the practice of meditation can help to still the mind so that we are no longer distracted by its continual chatter. Psychological inner work can free us from the traumas, anger, anxiety and other feelings that may cover our light. Gradually we come to know more of our true nature, learn to live in the light of our real self. It is said that the goal of every spiritual path is to live a guided life, guided by that within us which is eternal.

I come from a village that is basically in the middle of nowhere, and despite wanting to be in a band since I was in high school, there was hardly anyone who was in to the same thing as me which made it a bit difficult to follow through with it. Eventually I got older and started going to shows, and finally started meeting people who were in to the same thing. Eventually I started putting on shows with a few friends. Probably because I still didn't know anyone who wanted to be in a band with me, and putting on DIY shows seemed like the next best thing to being in a band. Now I play in a band, and the people I met through putting on shows were the first people to help out, and return the favor for my band. These people I now consider to be friends. I mean, I've got people hundreds of miles away that I consider to be friends, something I never thought would happen while I was in high school. I guess that's the best thing about being involved in the DIY punk community. It's cool to go somewhere far away for home, and be welcomed with open arms.
So here’s where things got interesting. The wood was split in one spot. I was trying to be positive and pretend like even though there was a huge gaping crack, this could work.

The real hero of the meal was dessert, because dessert is always the greatest part of any meal. I made Pioneer Woman's Apple Dumplings and they were a huge hit! I've never made them before, and was reminded more than a few times that it's a no-no to introduce a new recipe when company's over.

For the past 3 years I have had the amazing opportunity to work with Jerry’s Habima Theatre in Atlanta. This is Georgia’s only theatrical company directed and produced by professionals featuring actors (aged 18 and up) with developmental disabilities. Each year, the cast presents a full-scale adaptation of a Broadway musical to sell-out audiences. Last year I assistant directed and choreographed. Several people in the cast have Asperger’s. I am not an expert on any of the developmental disabilities represented among the cast. However, what I can tell you about the actors/actresses (regardless of what they are diagnosed with) is this:

I must admit that once it became clear that we had lost at least one of the chicks and most likely two, I feared the worst and assumed she would lose them all – especially seeing how wet she had become by yesterday evening. A brief period away from the nest sparked concern that she may have abandoned the remaining chicks but her return, rather drier than when she had left, did give me a little more hope of them making it through the night.
For many people these ages don’t make sense. We tend to make the grave error of comparing everything we read, hear or see, to our modern-day standards and perceptions.

The situation now becomes intriguing. For starters, there is a clear majority here against the bailout terms. If one adds on Antonis Samaras’s obvious doubts about it, the Troika is seen to have the support of just one in eight voters. Brussels will thus be forced to accept that its bailout scheme, timings and terms are unacceptable to the vast majority of Greeks. Based on their track-record, this won’t worry them for more than a second or two, but if made clear enough to the eurozone’s more apathetic voters, it might serve to point out what they (and that includes the UK) might well be in for one day.
Awlaki’s generalization is fundamentally flawed, and the opportunity for his envisioned “leap” will end when stability and pluralistic political processes begin to take hold.

For readers age eight and older, a number of books will provide hours of great reading. Robert Jae Sky has written To Dream the Impossible ($9.95, Create Space, Charleston, SC, available from Amazon.com). This father of three and grandfather of five was inspired by Olympic gold medalist Ross Powers and has written a lovely story of Rippy, a rabbit who wants to ski despite being told by everyone that rabbits do not ski. Not one to take no for an answer, Rippi perseveres and young readers will learn a value lesson while being highly entertained by this story. Margaret and the Moth Tree by Brit and Kari Trogen ($15.95, Kids Can Press) It is a classic story of an orphanage, a wicked woman who runs it, how Margaret defeats her and learns the power of making friends to find happiness in life. Alexander, Spy Catcher by Diane Stormer ($10.95, iUniverse, softcover) is about Alexander and his brother Ben who enjoy the usual things while coping with learning algebra, sports tryouts, and talking with girls. Then they discover that their Uncle Charlie may be in danger because of a secret government project he is working on. When they tell him of the strange things they have noticed, he disappears without a trace! They have to help their family discover what has happened to him and therein lies a gripping story. Riley Mack and the Other Known Troublemakers by Chris Grabenstein ($16.99, Harpercollins Childrens) is a title that instantly appealed to me. Written by a former improv comedian and president of the New York chapter of the Mystery Writers of America, it introduces seventh-grade mastermind, Riley and his pals, the “Gnat Pack”, as they fight the town bully and his crooked cop of a father. They liberate dogs held captive in a puppy mill and thwart a bank robbery! This one is a real page turner that is sure to please.
I find that many artificial sweeteners are more like “neutralizers”. They neutralize any bitterness in a recipe instead of really adding a pleasant sweetness the way sugar does. These cookies are an example of this, but if my tastebuds had recovered they would probably taste sweeter. Speaking of which, I found a couple of interesting articles this past week about sugar; one about how our tastebuds recover from eating excess sugar and they other about how sugar affects our memory.

An easy thing for preschoolers to observe in space is the moon. Take the kids outside at night and have them observe the shape of the moon throughout the month.

I make various kinds. Presenting my favourite--Roasted Butternut Squash and Sage Risotto. I was not at all fond of the butternut squash. One day it arrived, uninvited, in our organic veggie box. Initially I thought about chucking it in the bin but my conscience revolted. Reluctantly I consigned to the idea of making something with it. It turned out that with a little bit of love, herbs and roasting butternut squash can taste amazing. No longer is the squash unwelcome in my kitchen! The zealous convert that I am, now I keep buying this squash to make the risotto. After making risottos with various ingredients-- mushrooms, leeks, seafood, chicken and bacon, the butternut squash one tops my chart.

On Saturday night we were sitting around the table eating dinner when Jackson asked, “Do we have church tomorrow?” While innocent this question sends chills up my spin. I don’t want my kids thinking of church as a building, time, or location.

According to BlogHer.com, Keeslar was arrested in the early morning of Saturday, March 31, for no specific reason other than that authorities had found out about her practice and decided to pursue her. Keeslar’s many years of experience as an obstetrics nurse are technically not enough to satisfy the legal requirements of Indiana for midwifery, even though she had never reportedly had any issues with deliveries — to the contrary, her services were in high demand all across rural, northeastern Indiana, where home births are common and growing in popularity.

Overall - okay. For what it is (a slightly cheesy teen movie - produced by MTV, which is ironic given our usual television choices) that it was really well done. I think I may even have liked it a little more than the original.
The rest is the same as the machine, rolling out, adding cinnamon sugar, rolling up, etc. Sometimes, just to be safe, I will line the loaf pan with parchment paper, cut to the right length letting it hang over the sides. Then still spray or oil it. It makes it easier to release if the sweet swirl leaks out and decides to stick in the pan.

This movie, stylistically, was fantastic. Every shot seemed crafted for a purpose, for a reveal, for the ultimate experience in tension. Every shot, from the pans, to the turn around handhelds, to even the still shots, left me breathless in their scope of capturing the emotion on screen, without words. This, coupled with the seemingly wordless actions of the actors was literally phenomenal. You get a sense of the stepmother’s (Jung-ah Yum) anger and frustration with her new family, and the desperation of the daughters(Su-jeoung Lim & Geun-Young Moon), all beyond the control of the helpless father (Kap-su Kim). With every new scene, you are asked without words to figure out for yourself exactly what just happened and what it means in the bigger picture of the film. Some may find this style to be too confusing and frustrating, but the ambiguity should leave most viewers with their own interpretation, a nice way to end films for me.

Now that I think about it, we had quite the hair products back in the day. I think that I finally tried every shampoo that came out on the market. Notice I said, “finally.” It took my mom awhile to abandon her precious Head and Shoulders. I apologize to those ardent Head and Shoulders shampoo users, but I just couldn’t take it any longer. It may have been the choice for mom and dad, but oh hell, not for a teenager. Teenagers did not want to use Head and Shoulders. My time to revolt was near.
It promptly went back to the store where I informed the respectable-looking elderly Italian shopkeeper that what he had sold me was not Italian. I won't forget that moment: his eyes bulged dangerously in his withered face, vein throbbing upon the temple. He turned to his co-worker and then, while viciously strangling the foreigner, started yelling in the Romance language I do not speak. I could only grasp that he was just as scandalized as I was that the coffee pot in his 100% Italian product store did not meet his required qualifications.
I think it’s pretty neat that a fellow student and I were able to communicate our idea and get faculty behind us to support that idea. Dr. Parker and the fellow THRIVE members helped spread the word. Student services printed off flyers for us. Communications set us up a Twitter account and ran a story on us in their paper. It was all pretty cool and I’m glad I got to voice my idea and see it come to fruition. It’s a great feeling knowing that you did something to spark the conversation and get students excited about convocation again. It’s a small step in the right direction.

The closest this report comes to providing specific data about actual levels of waste production is a graph presented (pg. 32) which shows waste production (one and a quarter inches = one million curies): “at this scale, this bar would be 100 feet high (as tall as a ten story building)”. The reader is then free to take a ruler, and measure the size of the boxes in this graph and with this information, and a pencil and a piece of paper, we find weapons production spent fuel wastes amount to 960,000,000 curies from reactor operation, 1,500,000 Ci from chemical separation, and a few more million Ci of waste from target and component fabrication and research development and testing. This chart is one palimpsest among many in the ritual of aversion about cold war radioactive waste inventories.

Dear readers, we are at a precarious point in our history. When I wrote Enemies Foreign And Domestic in 2002, I was not making wild guesses. I was studying historical and recent foreign examples. When a Gangster Government is left unchecked by a complicit elite media, it is an entirely foreseeable consequence that federal "law enforcement" (sic) agencies will conduct the types of false-flag and other black ops described in EFAD. Power unchecked is power abused. Without the threat of significant media examination or congressional oversight, what do the gangsters have to fear? Nothing at all.
Today, marketing includes new media, social media, viral marketing, video, virtual seminars and managing your online reputation. If you’re thinking that your marketing doesn’t have to change and new strategies like social media and viral marketing don’t affect you—I’d like to share that times truly are changing and continue to progress. Even the way we get our “bread and butter” referrals has changed. And the reality is that, with-out adding some of these new aspects of marketing into your plan, the results you are having may begin (or already have begun) to dwindle. I believe that change in marketing is good and here are four examples:

So why did I notice the gate; the pure, white snow; and that they were both facing the sun? Because this is what God has done for me and I can’t help but see my life, the way He sees it. Jesus Christ is the Gate I must enter – the Gate that was broken and opened, so that I might find eternal life and salvation. And as I came to Jesus, filthy, unworthy, yet repentant, He washed my sins, with His precious blood; as white as snow. And now, both my flesh and my spirit can face the Son and drink from the Living Water, so that I may never thirst again.
Now there's some of that smoke. This beer is maybe in its 50s instead of upper 30s when I first tried it. The grittiness on the tongue is still there after you drink it down, but this one is so smooth you don't even care. Nice low carbonation. Very good. The maltiness comes in very well. I'm going to refrian from calling this a 4 Star beer, as I think the Sam Adams Black Lager is really the ticket. I just walked away from it to eat some corn. I come back and it's even better. 4 Stars man. Don't even put this one in the fridge. This one would be a little better with a touch more mouthfeel, but I'll keep it at a low 4 Star.

6. "My Old School" – 5:47
In other completely irrelevant medical news, last week we had the MRI follow up appointment with the orthopedic doctor. We got there and he said "I'm sorry but we don't have the official report yet. I'll have to take a look at the slides myself", then after another 20 minutes of him playing around on his computer, he said "I'm sorry but it looks like the network is down so I can't get a very clear picture of the slides!" It was a bit frustrating, particularly after waiting for over an hour for that news! But the good news is that from what he COULD see, and what he could tell from doing a physical examination of Maddy's hips, they appear to be quite well-engaged now so we don't need to do anything different with them (unless the MRI showed something concerning, which he said was unlikely). We don't need to follow up with him for another six months, but when we do follow up, we will be taking another complete set of X-rays then.
Yes - I lost a TON of weight. I am really proud of that. YES. I have baby weight to lose, and it will take a while. I get discouraged by that sometimes, but the good news is that I don't weigh 300 pounds this time, so starting over isn't really starting over. That makes me feel better. The weight loss healed my body in a way I never imagined it would - by allowing me to have a baby. Trust me, I never saw that coming.

It seems to me that this kind of club will work best for publishers or imprints with a narrower focus (as Sourcebooks is focusing on romance), although through-the-mail-book clubs sometimes offer a wide range of fiction and nonfiction. As I mentioned in my post about publisher relevancy, publishers may benefit from deciding what they want their name to mean (beyond “quality” which they all claim) and promoting a clear brand.

Evidence put before the court showed that Chauke’s fingerprints were found on a cake tin in the house of the murder victim and that a cell phone stolen at the time was found on Nkuna. Chauke argued that he had done painting work for the deceased in the house which accounted for his fingerprints on the cake tin and Nkuna said that he had received the cell phone as payment from a certain Derek for a water pump. Derek, he said, was subsequently shot by police.

I have good news though! My close friends and family know that I am not much of a morning person. I love my sleep, and I take full advantage of sleeping in on Sunday. Nothing better than rolling out of bed and heading to a brunch that you enjoy and don’t have to clean up after! BUT, sometimes I am in such a lazy mood that I don’t want to change out of my pj’s. This is where today’s blog originated. I decided to roll out of bed and make brunch at home. I fried up some bacon that I had delivered from Honored Prairie Farms last month. (One of the girls at the office always says” Bacon is meat candy!”…..especially if it comes from happy, healthy, appropriately fed pigs. ) I made some organic coffee in my French Press ( coffee is a heavily sprayed crop: buy organic). To finish things off, I made some coconut flour pancakes with a twist. I am always trying to find ways to fit more vegetables, protein, and herbs/spices into food in order to create healthier versions. I have made pancakes with coconut flour, almond flour, a combo, and many more varieties, but I actually loved these pancakes. So, I’m sharing them with you for 3 reasons: 1. Crossfitters are always looking for ways to increase their protein, 2. There are absolutely no grains or dairy whatsoever in these pancakes, making them an awesome option for those with food allergies, autoimmune disorders, or digestive issues, and 3. They have zucchini in them, and many of you will find an overabundance of this healthy vegetable in your garden this year!

The purpose for which the Muslims are required to fight is not as one might think to compel the unbelievers into embracing Islam. Rather their purpose is to put an end to the sovereignty and supremacy of the unbelievers so that the latter are unable to rule over men. The authority to rule should only be vested in those who follow the true faith; unbelievers who do not follow this true faith should live in a state of subordination…Jizyah symbolizes the submission of the unbelievers to the suzerainty of Islam. To pay the jizyah of their own hands “humbled” refers to payment in a state of submission. “Humbled” also reinforces the idea that the believers, rather than the unbelievers, should be the rulers in performance of their duty as God’s vicegerents.

AS US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was recently in South Africa, it is important to try to unpack the United States’ agenda towards our country and Africa. To do this, all those who help to determine South Africa’s destiny should study an important foreign policy address delivered by Clinton at a Washington meeting convened by the influential US Council on Foreign Relations last month, which contained some important messages about the US’s approach to South Africa.
Iris, then, is not at the asylum because she is crazy. She is there because she defied her husband. Other patients at Sanibel Asylum really are there for a reason. One is Ambrose Weller, former Confederate soldier. Ambrose fights very real demons as he relives painful memories of the death of his best friend. Cowell treats Ambrose with laudanum and directs him to think of the color blue in times of distress. “Blue. Blue like a marble. Like cobalt glass…Like ice in a beard…Like the stained glass windows of a church.” Cowell feels he is making progress with Ambrose, or at least until Iris’s arrival.
To give away any further plot points would be a disservice to first time viewers, so I'll leave my synopsis at that. But I'm not yet done talking about this picture.

In 2004 Mercedes Lackey started a new series called the Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms. It's a series of books set in a universe ruled by the Tradition, the force that drives fairy tales. Unlike her Elemental Masters series, which are rather more straight up fairy tale retellings, the stories set in the Five Hundred Kingdoms are very tongue in cheek. Lackey obviously has a lot of fun creating them and shows that humorous writing is a skill she definitely possesses. Where the earlier books mostly concentrated on one particular trope or fairy tale, The Sleeping Beauty, despite the title, is a fun mash-up of several fairy tales. It was quite funny and drew several out-loud chuckles while reading.

I Love Jamie Oliver and his Food Revolution. What isn't there to love? Here is a guy who wants to really help our kids be healthy. He isn't even from the USA. He just loves kids and people and good food. God bless this guy! We have a country filled with people who have major health issues caused from poor eating habits. Our children are getting deadly diseases like diabetes, they have high blood pressure, and they are growing up perpetuating the fast food nation. SCARY!

I can’t end this recap without telling you that one of my fellow half marathon runners passed away during the race after a sudden cardiac arrest. He’d been taken to the hospital by the time I got there, but my boss ran past as they were working on him. Two years older than me, and an avid runner. I was in shock. Even though I’d never met him, I couldn’t help but think that after pouring himself into training, he should be whining about how much his legs hurt and milking sympathy from his family right now, not taken so suddenly. My thoughts and prayers have definitely been with his family since. I still can’t believe it.
“Don’t do his job for him,” my friend replies.

My style notes for such a trip: my most comfortable trousers – the only time I wear leggings – a big cozy sweater or cardigan over a soft t-shirt – shoes you can easily slip on or off, a scarf you can roll into a neck pillow when you decide to sleep, things that are dirt proof. Lose the sweater/cardi if it’s a hot weather trip.

I have already decided on success. I am living and working for significance.
The branches in the basket didn't look so great after about a week, so I decided I needed something that would last much longer. Something bright and cheerful to welcome my guests from spring through summer. I stopped over at Hobby Lobby last week and picked handfuls of silk flowers. I sat in the corner of the store (I'm sure they thought I was nuts) and played around with different combinations until I found just the right one. I bought them at full price, but didn't take the tags off, because I had a hunch that they would be on sale this week. Sure enough...they were 50% off, so I took them in for a price adjustment.

If we could all take what we’ve learned in hindsight, be honest about it, and share it with future generations– perhaps we wouldn’t have so many broken, bullied, or confused kids out there. Right?
Smith argued that supply and demand as determined by consumer sovereignty set prices that accurately measured the value of goods and services. He hypothesized the existence of an Invisible Hand (not to be confused with a Divine Hand) that transformed into the common good economic activity driven by self-interest. He saw free markets as efficient, stable, and self-correcting. If the economy got out of sync in one period, it would regain its natural equilibrium in the next.

The designer rarely gets a credit on the acknowledgements page of the book, but they should. Their work is more visible to the reader than that of the editor or the proofreader. A useful trick for writers struggling with a book they can't evaluate is to print it out in a different font. Text looks different in a different font. The book you wrote in Arial (yuk) or Times New Roman (yuk) will look quite different if you print it in Goudy Old Style or Palatino. Suddenly, you can see the book with fresh eyes. Now - does your book suit a spindly, spidery font or an elegant, crisp font? Does that curly 'Q' really work? Do you have to change the font because of the style of one letter? (I often do.) *Now* you see what the book designer does.

Some critics had recently been stoking the fire under Scotland saying that Spain may veto the Scots EU membership amid worries that it may encourages separatism in Spain, a subject that has long caused tension between some autonomous regions.
The organization's main "fact-finder" was doubling as a spy for the white South African government while his buddy, a San Francisco cop who had tutored El Salvadoran death squads on the finer aspects of torture, was providing its officials with personal information on the organization's putative enemies when the story broke in San Francisco in December, 1992. The organization was the Anti-Defamation League.
1957 and Jerry Koosman in 1970. All three pitched exactly 212 innings and gave up exactly 74 earned runs. Even more striking, Parcell and Koosman both allowed 13 unearned runs. They did it very differently -- Parcell only struck out 74 batters all year, but he also only allowed seven home runs. Koosman struck out 118 (exact same as Foytack) but gave up 22 home runs.
