The ginger beer hides behind the smoothness of the Goslings Black Seal Rum until it reaches the back of your tongue, then jumps out and tattoos your tastebuds. Don't look for the fresh lime juice to rescue you; it piles on with the ginger beer. So why, after this liquid working over, do you feel so refreshed? Hmm . . . better have another while you think it over.

Church leaders should instead teach acceptance and love, address poverty, single-parent families, care for elderly, and jobless.

5:50: On an uphill lie, Tiger hammers his way out of the right rough on 14, but has too much muscle. His shot reaches the green, but keeps rolling off the back side. This will be a very long two-putt to save par and a hole that has played as the second-toughest one today.

Remember, the sooner you come to the realization that you have to do something to avoid the risk of foreclosure, the more options you will have available. Foreclosure does not have to happen to you.
Much of the play in the movie is desultory. Most is outdoors. Kicking a can down the street; tossing a football; running a stick along a fence. Maybe getting into mischief — boys, suddenly furtive, chuck rocks at the windows of a beaten-down shed. Sometimes, but seldom, adults look on or join in.

But here's the thing: The food tastes better there. The best salami sandwich on a hard roll you ever had did not come from a hand-cured-salumi factory, but from the Lido Italian deli when you were 8, and partly because it was always accompanied by an enormous dill pickle that you got to pluck out of a giant barrel, and a little hard candy slipped into your pocket by Mr. Lido.
Experts say overuse of antibiotics in both animals and humans has contributed to the problem. Both medical societies and government agencies have launched educational programs designed to educate physicians on appropriate prescribing of antibiotics.
The show concludes with a charming image of Harlequin and his partner Colombina from the Commedia dell'arte by Giovanni Domenico Ferreti. One of the remarkable aspects of the work is its elaborate gold frame with sculptured cherubs playing musical instruments. Typical of frames from the period, it almost outshines the painting as do many of the frames in this show.
Her son hasn't flown since then, but travel restrictions have caused hiccups in other family plans. At Niagara Falls this summer, they had to skip the Canadian side because they couldn't get the required passport cards in time for the trip.

Sure, that might be overly optimistic. The Giants looked like a flawed team at the end of last season and haven’t done much to change that. But the accelerated world of the post-lockout NFL hasn’t changed when we’ll know for sure, and that’s when the real games start.

Glorious Greenwich: Providing a suitably grandiose setting for the equestrian events during the Olympics, Greenwich is one of London's most historically resonant and attractive areas. This is the place to go to get a feel for the city's former role as the hub of the world's largest maritime empire, a period symbolized by the Royal Observatory (rmg.co.uk), perched on a hill in beautiful Greenwich Park, where visitors still roll up daily for a chance to stand on either side of the Meridian. The area's most famous landmark, the Cutty Sark (King William Walk, cuttysark.org.uk), an elegant 19th-century tea clipper preserved in dry-dock, burned in 2007 but reopened this year after a painstaking restoration. There also is a fantastic Sunday antiques market.

Working with fellow Canadian Gonzales (a.k.a. Chilly Gonzales, né Jason Beck), Feist recorded Let It Die with an extraordinary balance of casual feel and scrupulous attention to sonic detail. "Lo-fi, for me, is the way you want something to be portrayed and conveyed," Feist said in phone interview from a rest stop on a highway somewhere between Detroit and Washington, D.C., last week. "It's simplicity -- having less rather than more, letting people fill in their own blanks and not dishing it out too obviously."
The agency has issued 266 active testing permits for civilian drone applications but hasn't permitted drones in national airspace on a wide scale out of concern that the pilotless craft don't have an adequate "detect, sense and avoid" technology to prevent midair collisions.
I doubt any of us be asked, "Have you lost it for good?" if we couldn't carry the kid running up the stairs one night. Nor would we expect to find a throng of journalists at the local gym, observing a wince, and a lost step, asking soon after, "Where exactly does it hurt?"

The agent for the former Rutgers wide receiver knew it was ahead of the projections for his client, who had been pegged as a second- or third-round pick. But the sound of Sanu’s family and friends shouting in the background of his South Brunswick home, the surprises already unfolding in the draft and the fact the Bengals had two first-round picks and could use another target for quarterback Andy Dalton all made sense to McCartney, a former director of personnel for the Eagles and an agent for nearly a decade.

"If a public employee is getting paid by a private source, who do they work for?" she said.
These include Abdul, an undersized adolescent and sole earner for his parents and eight siblings, a boy with no illusions he will ever be more than a garbage sorter. And why should he be? He is tops in Annawadi, able to quickly divide the "empty water and whiskey bottles, mildewed newspapers, used tampon applicators" and other detritus into 60 piles, commodities he sells at a profit of $11 a day. This makes his family wealthy by the standards of Annawadi, where "only six of the slum's three thousand residents had permanent jobs"; where others ate rats and weeds, though these, too, Boo writes, "made an inestimable contribution to their neighbors. They gave those slumdwellers who didn't fry rats and eat weeds, like Abdul, a felt sense of their upward mobility."

The tax also has drawn opponents. Not just tea party adherents, but residents who can't see raising their taxes.
Leary has succeeded in crafting a space where he can nourish his creative urges, often taking familiar ingredients and giving them a unique twist. Deviled crab ($9) is reminiscent of his cooking at Rubicon, where he rose through the ranks to become head chef for four years after Traci Des Jardins left. He binds the generous flakes of seafood with lemon, mustard and a touch of mayonnaise, molding it into a cylinder with chunks of avocado and the fizzy essence of chopped green tomatoes, and topping the tower with hot, crispy onion rings.

While China's commercial success and stricter border control measures after the 9/11 attacks were some of the reasons behind the decline of North American integration, "the far more important reason is the absence of leadership" by the leaders of the three countries, the report said.
Mr. Rove, of all people should realize how ridiculous it is to think that Chrysler would spend well more than $10 million to produce and air an ad that some people might consider an oblique endorsement of the president's economic policies. After all, the man behind two super PAC juggernauts, American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, knows better than almost anyone that if Chrysler wanted to pay Mr. Obama back, it could buy as many TV ads as it wants directly calling for his re-election.

No arrests - which cost taxpayers money. No giving protesters the extra publicity they may have sought. And no further inflaming an already touchy situation.
“Winning the second game was huge,’’ Bradley said about yesterday’s game, in which they broke out to an 8-1 first inning lead. They had blown the opener after scoring five in the bottom of the sixth inning to take a 5-4 lead, then let Penn tie in the top of the seventh (the last inning in first games of college doubleheaders).

For the past couple of years, I have been pen pals with a man I'll call Mr. Gower. He used to be a Main Street pharmacist in outstate Missouri. Mail-order pharmacies run by pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts and Medco crushed his business.

The couple, who run the Portland jewelry boutique Betsy & Iya, knew they likely couldn't convert the wee-hour deal-hunters -- they just hoped to offer a less frenzied shopping option that would help local businesses. Around midnight, they'd hatched a plan and e-mailed a few fellow shopkeepers.
“How was it that you dismembered Ms. Micklo?” Hawkes said.

“I feel like, definitely, this tournament is an awesome opportunity for a lot of people that didn’t have a chance to show their skills during the regular season to have a chance to show their skills in this tournament. I’m lucky I get to go against T-Rob (Thomas Robinson) every day in practice, so I’m used to going against All-Americans. I think North Carolina was a great opportunity for me to go against some guys my size. Jared Sullinger and Sam Thompson from Ohio State will be really tough to play against. We are excited to play against them. Anthony Davis is in this tournament and he’s going to be the number one draft pick. There are a lot of great guys playing in this tournament and to be able to go against guys like that makes me better and more excited to play.”

A study published in the June American Journal of Preventive Medicine showed that only 34 percent of girls ages 13 to 17 have received the Gardasil vaccine. Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis collected data from 1,709 girls -- most of whom were white and had health insurance -- in six states. They found that girls who lived in counties with higher poverty and lower family-income levels were more likely to get the vaccine than their more well-off peers.

"There are bad things that occur all over this world," Drake said, "and the government will never be able to solve all those behaviors."
By the way, this has nothing to do with health care reform. It doesn't matter whether you're talking about the modest reform we are debating these days, which mostly has to do with the question of whether health insurance should be tied to employment, or more drastic reform like maybe cutting insurance companies out of the equation.

Putin has ruled Russia since 2000, the past four years as prime minister, and until December the nation had traded the unpredictability of democracy for the certainty of a strong hand. Then, a vocal and economically important minority, angered by fixed parliamentary elections, declared an end to the bargain, taking to the streets in protest. Their fearlessness and passion shook what Putin called his vertical of power, based on a line of authority that ran from the Kremlin down to the smallest city hall.

The third element, to complete the analogy, is the apparent inability of our City Council to effectively, collectively, deal with the problem. Splintered along the ideological lines noted above, the Council has been further handicapped over the last year or so by the numerous absences of Jim Vreeland. Discussions and decisions have been avoided, or delayed, or relegated to committees. The Council, at times, has seemed overwhelmed. Mary Ann Nihart and Len Stone inspire some confidence, but the two of them don't constitute a majority. They need help. Vreeland's resignation and Pete DeJarnatt's impending retirement will solve part of the problem. The full solution will depend on who replaces them.
There are several advantages to the Blazers tendering the $8.8 million offer to Oden. They could use him in a sign-and-trade deal; they could prevent another team from getting him cheaply; and if there is a lockout that extends into next season , he could rehabilitate without losing as many games as he would otherwise. Also, if the league loses games like it did during the 1999 lockout, the Blazers wouldn't have to pay him the full $8.8 million.

The festivities generally get under way with Champagne and an appetizer, such as caviar, foie gras or scrambled eggs with truffles. The next course might be Passot's lobster "cappuccino" - a lobster bisque served in a coffee cup and topped with orange zest-scented whipped cream - with a miniature lobster croque monsieur. The main course runs to game, perhaps squab, quail or venison. For The Chronicle, Passot suggested a pancetta-wrapped venison loin. A cheese course follows, with a purchased bûche de Noël, possibly from the Ritz pastry kitchen, for dessert.
"Rush has a loyal following of mostly mature adult conservatives.

Unlike the original, which Romney and some Republicans reject as amnesty, Rubio's version — let's call it Dream 2.0 — would not grant these young people automatic citizenship. Instead of green cards, which open the door to citizenship, most would get non-immigrant visas allowing them to remain in the U.S. legally. But neither would the new bill bar them from citizenship. No American with any sense of history wants to create a caste of second-class sub-citizens. Dream 2.0 grants green cards to young people who have served honorably in the military. And it leaves open the possibility that other beneficiaries could eventually become citizens by getting in a different green-card queue — one based on marriage, employment or family ties.

The decision to bring Millepied back to Ballet du Grand Théâtre de Genève predates both the release of "Black Swan" and the Music Center's decision to commission Millepied to found a new contemporary dance company. And, says Renae Williams Niles, Music Center director of dance presentations, the center had been angling to have the company come there before the movie as well. Seeing Millepied's "Nutcracker" turned her on to the company. "They are very much this kind of undiscovered European jewel," she said.

Auschwitz was part of a deliberate, systematic effort to kill off Europe's "undesirables" -- Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, etc. The Confederate prisons were low in resources and, to some extent, indifferent to the fate of those imprisoned (probably not much different than the Union POW camps). There was, however, no systematic effort to torture, maim, or kill the prisoners.

The only silver lining that I see to this debate, if you can call it that, is that perhaps our politicians will finally realize that they must finally make the tough decisions that we elect them to do as our representatives — not decisions that will necessarily enhance their political popularity with the members of their party, but that will save this country for the long-term to the benefit all Americans. I'm not holding my breath.

Posada’s infamous decision to pull himself from the lineup last May 14 crystallized what had become an extremely strained relationship with manager Joe Girardi and general manager Brian Cashman, a tension that began when the Yankees switched Posada from catcher to designated hitter.

Not that children should be looking for role models exclusively at the multiplex (although, these days, it might be a slightly safer place to look than the ballpark). Or that any adult really should be searching for validation from fictional characters.
"It's not enough what we do now. Think about it. They spend months and months training you to go to war," he said. "And you get next to nothing to prepare to go back home."

"The onus is still on the ECB to print money to make huge loans or bond purchases and draw a line under the crisis," said Jennifer McKeown, senior European economist at Capital Economics. "Perhaps if other member states sign up to Merkel and Sarkozy's proposals this week the (ECB) will step in."

Last chance before the teeth chatter
Of the 2.5 million eye injuries that occur annually, almost half of those happen at home.
But Davidson feels better physically, too. He underwent hip replacement surgery in January to fix a debilitating injury caused by years of punishment as an offensive lineman. Davidson's hip deteriorated last season to the point that, frankly, it became hard to watch him walk. His discomfort showed with every step or, more accurately, every limp. He supported himself with a cane by the end of the season.
This is similar to noting any mundane fact about any ethnic group -- for example, that there are high crime rates in black communities, or that a disproportionate number of black men are in jail. Those particular observations, however, do not give most Americans license to make an offhand joke about a black friend or colleague being a criminal. On the contrary, comments like that would be deemed racist at best and good material for a workplace lawsuit at worst.
Just as Benton Harbor ran out of cash in March 2010, Detroit stands on the brink of the same debacle, for the same reasons.

The lawsuit said some of the money went as kickbacks to entities controlled by Barone, who was later indicted along with two other GTI employees on charges they accepted millions to steer contracts to bogus firms run by associates. Prosecutors never accused Randhava of criminal wrongdoing. Barone died before trial and the others were convicted.

Terror fears? Let's build some walls. Illegal immigrant fears? More walls again, tighter restrictions, longer lines. Oh, and now that crossing the border is a huge pain, how about we tack on a bird flu scare. And just for fun, the drug wars?
Kreider got into the Rangers' lineup only because fellow rookie Carl Hagelin was suspended for three games when he elbowed Ottawa captain Daniel Alfredsson in Game 2. Kreider's play kept him on the ice even after Hagelin returned, and he is just one goal off the team lead through eight games of the playoffs.
He started his freshman year in high school at 6 feet 4 inches. That's why the coach recruited him for the basketball team and then ran him to exhaustion.

Complex sleep apnea is, in some respects, a mix of obstructive and central sleep apnea, and is probably the least common of the sleep breathing disorders. This condition is defined based on certain characteristics of a person's sleep during a sleep study. In complex sleep apnea, there is a diagnosis of OSA during monitored sleep, but then the patient develops a central sleep apnea pattern. In other words, the CPAP is effective at keeping the airway open, but the brain fails to send the signal to breathe.
Santorum later said his remarks were in the context of a past Supreme Court ruling on privacy and were not meant as "a statement on individual lifestyles."

Instead of Bing and Bob in Rio, young Latter-day Saints Price and Cunningham lose their old, wacky-sounding, made-in-America faith while on a mission to baptize souls in Uganda and wind up with a weirder new belief system in "The Book of Mormon" (bookofmormonbroadway.com).
The script: The Ducks have been able to consistently maintain a revolving door of solid talent along the offensive line, keeping the spread-option operating smoothly. Asper and Weems are the latest to depart and judging merely by recruiting, the Ducks have plenty of linemen to choose from. Expected healthy competition should lead to the development of another quality offensive line. On the surface, veterans Everett Benyard, Ryan Clanton and Fisher appear to have the inside track to replace Asper and Weems. Oregon signed just one offensive line recruit in February; junior college transfer Kyle Long out of Saddleback College. Long has one year of eligibility remaining and the son of NFL Hall of Fame defensive end Howie Long reportedly has the athleticism and skills to start right away. However, he won't be able to prove that until he arrives in the fall.
The dominoes started falling at a fast and furious pace a year ago when Robin Swoboda jumped from Channel 8 to Channel 3. Swoboda was teamed with Chris Tye on Channel 3's 7 p.m. newscast.

When visited last year, her planting of 250 bushes, then 3 years old, was less than waist high, and was growing so slowly that she doubted that tea cultivation in her area would ever be economically viable. That's not entirely surprising, since tea does best in areas with warm climate, abundant rainfall, acidic soil and low labor costs, rather different from Newman's location on the Central Coast, and indeed from most or all of California. (Nevertheless, Imperial Tea Court, which serves and sells tea at two locations in San Francisco and Berkeley, has announced that it is starting a California tea farm in the greater Bay area.)
Dish noted, however, that the "very limited popular programming" on AMC was "available to our customers through multiple other outlets such as Amazon.com, iTunes and Netflix."

Most facilities feature multiple sets of tees, proportioned to fit a congruous level of skill. But many amateurs ignore the guidelines. NGF statistics show the average green fee in the country is $45 with an additional average food and beverage cost of $7.

Because of that devotion to just-one-thing-more, Phil Jasner was almost always the last man out of the locker room - and no one worked that room more deftly - and then he would sit and spread the tools of the trade before him: Typewriter in the early days, computers later, steno notebooks, tape recorder, cup of ice for munching (it sounded like rifle fire). Then he would assume the position - elbows out, flaps up, ready, commence writing.
Prosecutors said Bafna went to Russo for advice in reducing his property taxes for his home and business.

Just weeks after submitting her application to volunteer, Testa was given access to the online requests and began filling them.
Kudos on cases
And I think that's what makes me most amazed about the power of language - when you can read, you can imagine that there's a different life for you. For me, that meant going to Harvard, writing books, working on the editorial board of a major newspaper. I didn't get any of these ideas from my family - my family didn't have those opportunities. Being able to read about other people's existences helped me to imagine my own possibilities.

That said, No Kidding! is no longer the only game in town for childfree people. The Internet has made it much easier to find like-minded people of any persuasion compared to 1984, the year No Kidding! was founded. For example, to be affiliated with No Kidding!, chapters must be open to both men and women; I am aware of at least one social club which is just for childfree women. The Internet has also facilitated virtual meetings of childfree people. More than a few childfree message boards and groups have formed and thrived over the past few years. To say the childfree are demoralized would be far from the truth.

Moe won 50 percent more playoff games than Karl has recorded as Denver's coach. Here's the bottom line: Moe announced his own dismissal after 9½ seasons on the job. Karl has completed eight seasons, yet his apologists act as if he deserves to coach forever.

* There was a stark difference to me between the postgame locker rooms for the No. 1 seed and No. 2 seed in the East. After beating No. 16 seed North Carolina Asheville by seven, Syracuse seemed much more about the idea of surviving and advancing, talking mostly about finding a way to win. After Ohio State beat No. 15 seed Loyola by 19, the Buckeyes seemed much more self-critical and upset with the way they played.

Pizza Roma is easy to miss. Tucked into a strip mall off SOM Center and Wilson Mills Roads in Mayfield, the entrance is temporarily obscured by construction scaffolding. There’s nothing really special about the inside of Pizza Roma, either. It’s a small place with a couple of tables, a counter where you place your order, and an open space that houses the kitchen and ovens. It reminded us of a typical neighborhood pizzeria that you’d more likely find in the city, not the suburbs.

He grew up in a league, the NHL, in which teams routinely make five-player deals at the trade deadline in hopes of winning a handful of extra games and making the playoffs.

“I would have been much more diligent in trying to reduce my college expenses. College wasn’t as expensive back then as it is now, but it was still a major financial burden. Rather than trying to minimize expenses before I graduated, I found myself on graduation day with more debt than I should have. I likely qualified for several scholarships and grants, but I never fully investigated the topic.

I did work hard on my schoolwork, but I could have done more to ease the debt I graduated with.” – Andrew Schrage, co-owner, Money Crashers Personal Finance

Markets will provide the lowest-cost energy possible because energy producers compete mightily with one another for profit. The argument we frequently hear that "we need every source of energy in the future to meet our staggering energy needs" is ridiculous. Some energy -- such as nuclear fusion and grid-connected solar energy -- is simply too expensive to produce now, which is to say, it costs more to generate than it is worth. Subsidies and mandates to get "every energy source to market" simply force us to generate and consume energy that costs more than it is worth.

While Gunther Schuller's tag, Third Stream — classical and jazz tributaries merging to form another river — placed a label on classical-jazz fusions in 1957, examples of classical musicians raiding African influences exist even before jazz came to be. One can trace them as far back as Louis Moreau Gottschalk's piano music before the Civil War, then forward to Charles Ives' irreverent injections of disruptive ragtime in " Central Park in the Dark," Debussy's "Golliwog's Cakewalk" and Stravinsky's "L'Histoire du Soldat." Between the world wars, incorporating jazz into concert works became an international vogue — affecting domestic and European composers as diverse as Copland, Ravel, Kurt Weill, Erwin Schulhoff and even Shostakovich.

ø"Interest is always heightened when people feel like they can participate, when they can see some photos, get some information" on, for instance, what guests dined on and danced to, says Bonnie Fuller, editor in chief of HollywoodLife.com, where positive celebrity news such as weddings and births traffics more than meltdowns.
