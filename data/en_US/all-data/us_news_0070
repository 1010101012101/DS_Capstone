That same lopsided coverage has characterized the ongoing debate between Obama and the leaders of religious institutions that object to his contraception mandate. According to a Gallup poll released last week, 49 percent of men back the religious leaders in that dispute and 44 percent back Obama.

The incident was later hotlined to the state Children's Division which then alerted city police. Two 24/7 staff members on the field trip were questioned by police on June 11 and admitted they had failed to do a head-count nor realize that one of the children was missing. They were arrested for endangering the welfare of a child, but the city circuit attorney's office declined to take up the charges.

Americans are squeamish about death. We place cemeteries in parklike settings on the edges of cities and suburbs, as if to distance ourselves from grief and loss. We put war memorials in city squares but set them apart, at least mentally, as colorful reminders of the past that have little power to conjure violence and carnage.

I'd like to see Oregon take the weakest part of its waiver application -- say, the part about English language learners -- and turn it into a blockbuster. Oregon could become nationally renowned as a state that turns those "hard-to-teach" students into bilingual college graduates, by enlisting everyone from preschool teachers on up and by ending the financial incentive to teach English slowly. Tackling this one challenge would pay dividends for all students, because it would require Oregon to be more strategic, more creative and less defensive about virtually every aspect of K-12 education.

Rockies catcher Ramon Hernandez had a tough time at the dish Friday night. He was fine behind the plate, but reaching home was another matter. He threw a short temper tantrum in the fourth inning after being tagged out by catcher Jonathan Lucroy. Hernandez chugged home from second base on a single by pitcher Jhoulys Chacin, and appeared to avoid the tag. Home plate umpire Larry Vanover thought otherwise. In the sixth, Hernandez was tagged out trying to score from third on Chris Nelson's infield grounder.
Isom said that the department lacks a policy on collecting DNA from officers and that probably contributes to officers' concerns.

But “New York is Killing Me” sports a truly inventive, percussion-heavy arrangement, and there’s a seductive charm to the title track, which backs Scott-Heron’s crooning with a gently rolling guitar riff. Scott-Heron’s take on Brook Benton’s “I’ll Take Care of You” is dignified and deeply soulful. The most important thing about this album, of course, is that its existence suggests that Scott-Heron’s life is back in order. But tracks like these suggest that he still has some musical revelations to offer, as well.
"And I’d like to apologize to the residents of Secaucus for the embarrassment this has created," the 66-year-old man added, a beat later. Then, abruptly, as he stared straight at U.S. District Judge Jose L. Linares, "I’m ready to be sentenced."

"Femme Fatale," her new album, is an intermittently winning collection of sleek synth-pop, as streamlined and aerodynamic as a freshly minted luxury automobile. It is also the end stage of Spears’ detachment, and self-effacement: She wrote none of the songs on the album, contributed next to nothing to their production, and allowed her voice to be digitally manipulated to the point of unrecognizability.
But the job frustrated Kaptur. She hoped to replicate what she had done in Chicago but found it difficult with what she described as a minuscule budget.

I'm excited about the beers from the big brewers that go beyond light American lager to help today's beer beginners see there's more to beer out there.

It all builds to a climax that shatters more than simply the fragile Roger Moore pastiche that Chris has pieced together as his own notion of a hip persona. So far, so McCabe-like: Readers familiar with his work may begin to feel that they've been here before -- that Chris is an awful lot like Francie Brady of "The Butcher Boy," just a little further down the line. Stop there, and things seem entertaining -- McCabe is incapable of not telling an interesting story -- if a bit disappointing, particularly when measured against "Winterwood," the brilliant novelistic exploration of Ireland's new national identity that the author published two years ago.

Only Knightley goes over the top, and you could certainly argue that she's meant to. You could also argue that she isn't, that her jaw-jutting histrionics seem out of place in the film.

Still, in a film that's all about the proper maintaining of one's buttoned-up fa�ade, it's jarring.

The rooms, with $10,000 beds actually designed to make you feel like you’re floating, are on the top 11 floors of a 37-story building. We dine on the 29th floor at Nadaman, an outpost of a fine-dining chain (not at all an oxymoron in Tokyo) where we eat sea urchin chawanmushi egg custard and almost absurdly delicate wagyu beef.

Hales: This is so critical. I've talked to so many parents going door to door campaigning for this office who really want to maintain support for public schools in Portland. But there's quite a bit of fatigue among those parents who have had to have auction after auction to keep the arts program in their neighborhood school. We have been holding education together with duct tape and bake sales in this city. That's commendable for those activists, but fatiguing as well. We have to put education on firm footing. Arts and culture have to be part of that basic understanding of what school will provide for kids. So that's why I keep coming back to education. If our kids aren't artists by the time they graduate from high school, the odds they'll care about the arts and have the joy of experiencing it in their adult life is pretty low. I raised my kids with an appreciation for the arts. I'm proud of them. My daughter is a modern dancer, working in New York. My son is a stage manager at Milagro, as I mentioned. That's important to me.
Starting this month, the national focus will be on Civil War anniversaries in the East, where the best-known battles occurred. But fighting started on the Missouri-Kansas border in 1856, nearly five years before Ft. Sumter, S.C., in the vicious struggle over Kansas statehood. And it went on long after Gen. Robert E.

Trust me, the moralist in me would love to see the Tigers either release Young or bench him until this whole mess is over. He may be innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, but hes undoubtedly guilty of terrible judgment at a time when his team needs him badly. But we dont get to be the judge and the jury. We can certainly pass judgment and weve heard plenty of people do that over the last 72 hours. But we dont get to read a police report and leap to the preposterous conclusion that the Tigers should "do the right thing:"" and dump Young immediately. In fact, if MLB determines that hes clear to play, he should be back in the lineup as soon as Jim Leyland wants him there.

The Westminster restaurant is decidedly modern: deep blue tiles climb one wall as if to draw a high-water mark; a flat-screen TV recedes elegantly into the back of the dining room. It's a clean style cultivated by the Chau family, which runs Hoang Yen with a welcoming air. The result is an open and inclusive space where uniformed electricians lunch alongside young mothers, and businessmen pop in for takeout as they pass through Little Saigon.
Dorothy was planning to take the bus home, so Tony offered to give her a lift. She bumped her head getting out of his car. He called later to ask her if she was OK, and the rest, as they say, is history.
Bilecki says a jogger reported seeing Hensley fall from the kayak into the water. No one saw any swans attack him, but witnesses said they saw two birds circling him after he fell into the water. He went under as he attempted to swim to shore.
Chaison added that he doesn't expect any big changes in contracts with those two automakers this year. The union is likely to wait until 2015 when the economy has, it's hoped, improved and when it will have the ability to strike to make bigger changes.
Less heartening is the high-tech industries' share of the region's overall work force. The share stood at 8.8 percent in 2008, lagging the rest of Ohio, the Midwest and the country.
The singer stayed firm in his beliefs.
Factory activity weakened this spring, in part because of temporary factors. High gasoline prices forced consumers to spend less elsewhere, which cut demand for factory goods. And the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in Japan led to supply-chain disruptions that slowed U.S. manufacturing production, particularly in the auto and computer industries.

Kane County Clerk John A. "Jack" Cunningham, 73, scored a political victory this week, fighting his way back onto the Republican primary ballot against Rep. Judy Biggert, 74. The state elections board had kicked him off because two digits were transposed in a circulator's address on 31 pages of his nominating petitions. A circuit court judge agreed that was a poor reason to disenfranchise the hundreds of voters who signed those sheets. It was a good call.

Plain Dealer reporters Donald Rosenberg and John Soeder contributed to this story.
The game also featured a bounceback effort from maligned point guard Raymond Felton. One game after his two hideous late-game blunders cost the Blazers a win over the Utah Jazz, Felton nearly registered a triple double, finishing with 14 points, nine assists and eight rebounds. His best stretch of the game -- and maybe the season -- came in the third quarter, when he was tossing alley-oop lobs to Nicolas Batum and Hickson and swishing three-pointers as the Blazers built a 13-point lead.

We recall the Bernie Madoff scandal from 2008 -- where for years he actually made off with an estimated $50 billion -- in the mother of all Ponzi schemes. Even the online gaming website for Full Tilt Poker is allegedly a Ponzi scam according to the Department of Justice. It appears that $444 million may have been stolen. It's Ponzimonium out there, and people need to be on extra special alert to avoid swindlers' webs.

This year with the young guys, it took us a long time to get going."

In 1989, Kroll resigned from his job to serve as a mitigation expert for Harris. Scouring Harris' history, Kroll was tasked with discovering clues that might signal to an appeals court that Harris deserved life in prison, not death by poison gas.

Four more years of a radical leftist in the White House would be unacceptable. And Will's notion that preserving Republican control of the House and winning Republican control of the Senate would checkmate President Barack Obama assumes a respect for the separation of powers, the co-equal branches of government, the prerogatives of states and the rights of individuals that Obama simply lacks.

But for a decade, such newspapers as the Hartford (Conn.)

Shehadeh's memoir describes six sarhat, walks on which a person "wanders aimlessly, not restricted by time and place, going where his spirit takes him to nourish his soul and rejuvenate himself." In describing walks taken through the countryside around Ramallah between 1978 and 2006, Shehadeh documents "a vanishing landscape" altered by conflict. The San Francisco Chronicle was moved by Shehadeh's method of "lyrically interweaving" his "personal search for connection with the soil with a sobering chronicle of Israeli West Bank settlement."
Outlook: Cardinals believe strong 7-2 finish creates optimism. Still unsettled, though, is quarterback situation. Whisenhunt says there will be open competition in training camp between Kolb and Skelton. Offensive line has been inconsistent, and that's putting it charitably. Arizona still is looking for reliable No. 2 WR behind Larry Fitzgerald. That could lead to selection of Floyd if he's around. Addressing OT spot seems better bet, though.

Relief was scarce, too. Just when other cycling classes would have relented and dropped to a lower gear, Carlone had the audacity to increase the resistance. What's more, she actually monitored her charges, double-checking that each of us was, in fact, riding in the proper gear and hitting the target pedal rate.
In the early 20th century, Ushuaia was a Siberia-like outpost, and Argentina built a notorious prison compound here, with convicts put to work building roads and other infrastructure.

But John Scherer must be commended for what he does with Robert. The squeaky-voiced and nervous character is a skimmed milquetoast. Scherer amuses with each eyeroll and gulp, en route to having all his fuses blown. Good that this was the era when men carried handkerchiefs, for Scherer needs his quite often to mop his brow. He often has his hand over his heart, probably to see if it’s still ticking.
A Marlins source insisted his team rescinded its well-publicized bid for Pujols shortly after reaching agreement with the St. Charles native.
Another concern is the high-powered marketing of Lap-Band surgery virtually as a cosmetic procedure. The best example is the 1-800-GET-THIN freeway billboard campaign here in Southern California, sponsored by a firm that has identified itself as "a marketing company" that "provides marketing for the 'Lap Band®' procedure." (That little symbol signifies that "Lap-Band" is an Allergan trademark.)

"True Blood" (9 p.m. Sunday, HBO): One thing you have to say about executive producer Alan Ball's supernatural cable drama -- it's rarely in danger of repeating itself. Each plot-packed season has its distinct themes and emotional shadings. The fourth season went seriously bump in the night with last week's graveyard showdown between the vampires and Marnie's spell-casting witches. Sookie (Anna Paquin) was injured. Bill (Stephen Moyer) was captured. And the eerie battle is brewing into a war.

To a man almost, the Flyers checked out. After scoring the game’s first goal and looking every bit the better team they clearly believe themselves to be, the Flyers simply stopped skating.

I've talked to several directors who've made movies in 3-D, and there is a consensus among them - to do it right, you have to have conceived the entire project in 3-D, soup to nuts. The shots, the angles, the colors. Conversions like "Titanic" are usually at a distinct disadvantage.
But as a personnel evaluator, John Elway is about impact players, about speed, about taking the best player available when the team's pick rolls around, regardless of position. And truth be told, the best teams in the draft year after year hold to that philosophy.
He predicts the new pesticide discharge permits will set back efforts to control mosquitoes that spread disease and algae that clogs water systems, and will harm the finances of companies, homeowners, farmers and local governments who will have to deal with extra paperwork.
Essentially, it's the post-9/11 odyssey of four adventurous but unworldly buddies -- one of them, Monir, vanished during the adventure, and is presumed dead -- who traveled from London to Karachi, where Asif was to be married, and took a side trip to Afghanistan on an impulse. After getting caught in a Northern Alliance roundup of Taliban fighters, they did several months of hard time in Afghan prisons, then did much longer -- and much harder -- time at Guantanamo until British authorities verified their claims of innocence, brought them home and set them free without charge. (At the moment when, according to the FBI, the trio was spotted at a rally attended by Osama bin Laden and Mohammed Atta, Shafiq was working in a British electrical store, and Asif and Ruhel, who had criminal records, were doing community service in Tipton as parolees.)
7:54 p.m.: First half is over but Bob Costas says it's going to take a while for them to get stage ready so don't expect Madonna immediately. People have been saying halftime is going to be 30 minutes overall so she's got to be out there 10 minutes from now at most, I think.

First, the 2 percent increase in undergraduate tuition and room and board is lower than in years past, and should allow us to meet anticipated mandated cost increases - such as Jesuit affirmative action hires and student disability services - as well as increases in the cost of other services and products we purchase.

The activities kick off May 27 with a festival celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge. The bash, which culminates with a fireworks show, will be held along the 4-mile stretch from Fort Point to Pier 39. Because the event is free, officials say there is no way to gauge how many people might attend. Mary Currie, a bridge spokeswoman, said the expectation is that thousands will participate from all over the country. But the hope is that because the waterfront is spread out, there will be some breathing room.

"Christmas", he explained to me, "is a day to refocus on the teachings of Jesus and to recommit to a process of personal, spiritual rebirth. Every birth is a miracle," he said, "and if we look inside the miracle, we can connect with the mystery we call God and experience the oneness with all creation."

I also love the way Scott keeps the alien unseen for so much of the gut-churning build up, then delivers one of the most terrifying creatures ever seen on screen.

That was still the score when Redick got free on an out of bounds play and hit a 3 from the wing to tie it with 38.7 left.
The next day I went to a home store. I bought bags of fertilizer and a spreader. When I got home, I suited up and declared war on my weeds. A few days after applying the fertilizer, I noticed something: stripes were appearing in neat rows across our front yard. They looked like lanes for sprinters. The kids giggled every time they walked in the house. In the war against weeds, I had lost the first skirmish.

That led Harmon to introduce a bill on Feb. 7 that would make it legal across the state to serve as a mayor and county commissioner, even if the agencies have basic contractual agreements such as those involving 911 dispatching or sewer services. Under the state's Public Officer Prohibited Activities Act, a county commissioner isn't supposed to serve on a community's governing board if the county government and the community have a contractual relationship.

Here is a New York advertising agency of the late 1950s and early 1960s, a time of guiltless smoking and drinking. Spouses cheat and nice single women get pregnant, as they do today. But a more orderly culture makes these falls from grace more interesting.
Now, an American traveling in Spain might find it surreal to see TV ads showing All-Bran cereal floating in a steaming cup of coffee. Kellogg, which makes Keebler, Cheez-It and Kashi bars, declined to give details on how well the cereal is selling there, but it said the marketing has resulted in "great results."
Prosecutor Chris Ramras, however, saw the evidence differently. He said the group chanced across Davis' home on the way to the hospital. White testified that when he saw Davis dashing toward his car, he thought Davis was going to follow them again. He fired in Davis' direction to ward him off.

The Olympics are (almost) back, and it's a good time to sing again the ballad of Jesse Owens, the black American track star who put the lie to Adolf Hitler's master-race malarkey at the 1936 Summer Olympics by winning four gold medals. (It's never not a good time to sing that song, of course.) "Jesse Owens," premiering Tuesday on PBS SoCal as part of the series "American Experience," is the latest work to take up that inspiring tune.

Since then, little has gone right. He failed to earn a return trip to the Olympics in 2008, then developed an Achilles tendon injury that finally was diagnosed and surgically repaired early in 2010. Following that, he suffered a stress fracture in his foot and a stress reaction in his tibia, and twice moved his training base.
But the school is also deeply religious. Westminster's mission statement says that it 'strives to help develop the Christian mind and character of students." Those values are reinforced with chapel services each Wednesday and with required high school courses such as biblical ethics and New Testament Survey. Timothy Wiens, an assistant professor of education at Wheaton College in Illinois, said Westminster was considered a leader among faith-based schools striving to be deeply rigorous in academics.
But the previously unknown, "atypical" versions of mad cow disease are raising new questions.
When I got into the light, I saw what appeared to be a long night crawler. It was segmented and very squirmy. I used a napkin to grab it, but it squirmed out of my hand almost immediately. I flushed it down the toilet.
West High School's fantastic drum line kicked off the groundbreaking, doing its thing on Navajo Street just north of West 10th Avenue in the Lincoln projects.
I know next to nothing about astronomy, but still the sky fills me with wonder. The stars linger in the galaxies, fixed on high light years away. They lead me to wonder about the breadth of God's providence and grace. They shine with brilliance, but also mystery. They cause me to think of those oddest of all characters in the gospel, those Eastern magi.
The test question: Are their carbon footprints also equal?
In the late 1990s, a Department of Human Services special review board granted provisional discharge for a patient, but it was revoked after he committed technical violations of his release. Opheim's case represents the first time that judicial review has resulted in a discharge ruling.

Bell, who the prosecutor's office has identified as a Bloods gang member, was one of those fleeing. While running away, he turned and fired several shots, one of them striking D'haiti in the head, prosecutors said. He died at the scene.
"It just fell into place for me and I love knowing that I'll be able to go out there, but I've got a season at Edwardsville to finish up," said Sweatt, who also considered the Illinois and Oklahoma. "Knowing people with cancer is something that's touched me a few times over the years and it's a major problem in general.

Calhoun will leave CK as the winningest player in program history, including a pair of CHSAA Class AA intersectional titles and a New York State Federation championship.
"I'm definitely disappointed," said Jon "Big Nut" Peters of Fremont, a familiar sight on gameday in his scarlet and gray-painted face, OSU jersey, silver legs and the Buckeye doll in hand. "I'm sick to my stomach over it because I like Coach Tressel. I think he did a pretty good job overall, and anytime you have a change in a program when things are going good, it's definitely going to be a loss."
But senior center Lynetta Kizer, playing for the injured Hawkins, helped get Texas A&M (24-11) 6-4 forward Kelsey Bone in foul trouble. Thomas, who struggled in her team’s second-round win over Louisville in College Park, started making shots. And Mincy, who helped the Terps get to the Sweet 16 with 24 points, kept making shots.
Located in Keller Plaza, 4544 Lemay Ferry Road, the center's different departments, ranging from Revenue to Public Works to Municipal Court, are not under one big roof; they are located in different storefronts.
The WHL also fined Laxdal $500 for comments he made following the Oil Kings’ 5-1 loss in Game 2 Friday when he criticized referees Matt Kirk and Nathan Wieler as well as the replay officials. Still no word from the league on whom else is getting fined for missing Travis Ewanyk’s wraparound goal for Edmonton in the second period of Game 2.
"The cap-and-trade bill, which was designed allegedly for the purposes of green jobs, is now secretly being diverted into the general budget," Lonegan told a crowd of 40 supporters.
Babeu said this week that one of his duties was to raise money for the school and that he was recognized for refinancing and consolidating the school's debts and renovating school properties. A DeSisto board member said in court documents that Babeu was authorized in 2000 to legally sign bank loans on behalf of DeSisto.
Consequently, each Oregon player has spent numerous time chasing mobile quarterbacks in practice.
But next time you look in the mirror and see that distinctive "protuberance of flesh above the waistband of a tight pair of trousers," (to quote the OED) you should try saying "muffin top" with a little love, says Jean Fain, author of "The Self-Compassion Diet", and a practicing psychotherapist who teaches at Harvard Medical School. That might be a better way of losing that unwanted protuberance than the usual ways in which women talk about the parts of their bodies they would like to change, tighten, shape or lose, she says.
McMillan said he knows full well what Memphis and Phoenix are doing, but he does not want the Blazers to get into a mindset of trying to hold onto the No. 8 spot. Instead, he would like to try to move up, if possible.

Analysts and casino industry executives are split on Resorts' outlook. Some feel the casino's time has passed it by and the headwinds of competition are simply too strong. Others say that because Gomes and Bailey are getting in at such a low price and will carry virtually no debt, they'll be able to hold expenses down, ride out the storm and make a lot of money when things improve.
Desserts are largely a variation on the theme of Häagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream, never a bad place to start. It livens up an Oregon berry cobbler and a dense chocolate bread pudding. It's at the core of Bananas Foster, tasty although the caramel base is relatively thin. Standing on its own is a thick slab of admirable, highly chocolaty silk pie.
This isn't anything new. Even when Thompson was in elementary school, a shadow of stardom followed him.
But repairing the building was not included in the cost savings of renting, which would come entirely from lowering heat, water, snow removal and other costs.

Musician Zane Carney is 27.
Beilein's three NCAA tournament teams at Michigan all had two weaknesses: They lacked size, and they lacked athleticism. That will change next year. McGary is high-energy, highly touted and 6-foot-10. Robinson is a 6-6 forward with varied offensive skills. He and Stauskas should keep defenses from constantly trapping Burke, and take pressure off Tim Hardaway Jr., who is a terrific scorer but a weak ball-handler.
Make kitchen space: No matter the size, the kitchen always ends up as the gathering spot. Guests will bring bottles of wine, will need to replenish ice or will just want to chit-chat. You can maximize your kitchen space by clearing off counters, tables and islands. Put the toaster in a drawer and the dish drainer in a cabinet. "If you have extra dishes, put them away or hide them in the dishwasher," Raymond says.

Currently a researcher at UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Ma and his lab team have spent years studying the roles of proteins, following leads like detectives of the microscopic. Their early research looked at skeletal muscle and how calcium plays a role in atrophy and aging. Then in 2006, they published a study showing cells in older mice were essentially leaking calcium — causing a natural aging process and inefficient muscle function.
"Last year we finished second to Belleville in the South Division and then beat them in the playoffs. This year we'd like to win the South Division and the Fifth Division and make it back to the state tournament. But this time we just don't want to make it there - we want to win it."

A low-budget take on the 1950s Starkweather-Fugate murder spree (the same crimes that also inspired Terence Malick's "Badlands"), director George Hood's movie, filmed in Portland in 1974, was nationally distributed with the title "Stark Raving Mad," and today is difficult to find anywhere. It's worth seeing for its place in Oregon film history alone: long before today's fertile, celebrated film scene, here was an independent feature production starring Portland actors and using mostly Portland crew members. Hood and producer-writer Don Gronquist will be on hand to present the movie.
As a result, in 2010, only 2 percent of the autistic children getting intensive treatments at state expense were in managed-care plans. The majority, Dawson says, were "by and large middle class or upper-middle-class children."

However, proponents concede that most of the permanent jobs would land on the lower end of the pay scale -- closer to $20,000 than $50,000. Also, those jobs aren't coming any time soon, since the entire project likely would be tied up for years in a legal fight over the casino's constitutionality.

4. Will Fisher change the Rams' sad-sack image? Will NFL free agents view the Rams differently now? Will he attract free agents that otherwise would have laughed at the idea of even considering employment with the Rams, unless the Rams were willing to overpay them by a ridiculous amount? I think it's fair to say that this is a test run. Free agents would likely be more willing to sign with the Rams after Fisher and Snead get them up and running. But Fisher is a player's coach; guys truly enjoyed playing for him in Tennessee. I would think that Fisher's presence would help the Rams in their recruiting pitch. His installation at Rams Park conveys a strong organizational desire to win. But it's also about the money, and the free agents are looking to cash in.
In the end, they still like Thomas' potential, but now it's up to him to battle his way into the lineup.

A bond the EFSF issued earlier this month to fund part of its bailout for Ireland, for instance, required a much higher premium to garner enough investor interest.

The Matthews Band is frequently compared to the Grateful Dead, but that's misleading. All the group shares with the Dead is a mass audience, a taste for syncopation, and a propensity to indulge in long solos. Really, Matthews is best understood as the inheritor of '80s globetrotting pop-rock: David Byrne, Sting, and especially Paul Simon, all of whom found room in their otherwise mainstream material for foreign influences: Caribbean reggae, Cuban jazz, African pop, Brazilian samba. The Caravan lineup featured many acts that shared Matthews' open-mindedness, omnivorous musical appetites, and, to be fair, willingness to sell exotic tropes to a mostly white, politically engaged, college-educated audience searching for answers to knotty problems. The excellent Budos Band, based in Staten Island, played a fusion of funk rock, jazz, and Ethiopian folk. Mariachi El Bronx, one of the highlights of the first day of the festival, dressed up their American pop-punk songs in bright Mexican garb. Rebelution and Thievery Corporation, both imaginative acts from the States, headed to the islands for somewhat cautious takes on reggae and dub. When anti-apartheid folksinger Vusi Mahlasela told the crowd gathered at the smaller Atlantic Stage that Westerners did not understand the concept of Ubuntu, nobody objected.

More likely, the city would "re-enter" the county as its 92nd municipality. The city of St. Louis would keep its own mayor and aldermen and fire department. But it likely would shed many of the functions that St. Louis County also performs, such as collecting property taxes and running a prosecutor's office and its own courts. It would, governmentally speaking, become a giant urban Kirkwood.

That is still the City Club's purpose as it begins a year-long celebration leading up to its centennial. In an era of information overload and white-hot partisanship, when so many people seem to prefer hearing their beliefs echoed rather than challenged, that mission may strike some people not merely as quaint, but as hopelessly out of date. On the contrary, the fact that the City Club's founding principles seem so countercultural a century later makes them -- and the organization itself -- more relevant than ever.
So Eliot Spitzer, who came to office with 70 percent of the vote, has accomplished nothing that Silver and Bruno didn't want him to accomplish, for reasons of their own - and the public-opinion polls say 50 plus percent of New Yorkers now think their governor is a liar.

Consider packing just one carry-on-size bag (9-by-22-by-14 inches) and sharing an extra bag with your travel partner. I know — realistically, you'll be tempted to bring more. But cruising with limited luggage can be done without adversely impacting your trip; I've done it, and was happy I did. Pack one bag each, as if traveling alone, then share the third bag for bulky cruise extras (such as formal wear). If traveling before or after the cruise, you can store that third, nonessential bag at a friendly hotel or in a train-station luggage locker.

Our only gripes with the Baja center on the TRD exhaust package, which does not feel impressive from our ears or from the driver's seat. The note sounds more like an overworked hairdryer than the throaty or rumbly tone you'd expect from this kind of a vehicle.

Mike Lupica, New York Daily News: "Gary Carter helped make the Mets champions as much as Hernandez did. In a clubhouse full of bad boys and bad behavior and bad habits, he was such a good man. And as great as he was with the Montreal Expos, he will always be a Met out of October of 1986 . . . when there were two outs in the bottom of the 10th in Game 6 of the World Series, two outs and nobody on, when the team that had won 108 games in the regular season and then won that wonderful NLCS against the Astros was that close to going home, Kid was the first to absolutely refuse to make the last out of the World Series. He singled, Kevin Mitchell and Ray Knight singled. Finally Mookie, with that slow roller down the first base line, like the whole season rolled right through Bill Buckner's legs in that moment."

The fiercely expressed determination in GOP ranks to oust Mr. Obama, voiced repeatedly by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in his battle cry to make him "a one-term president," seems to have lost some of its zeal amid the civil war for the party nomination. The wish may be undiminished, but the conviction that it will be achieved now lacks the previous certitude.

The center, which is the consistency of uncooked shrimp, can poke out and press against a nerve in the spine. In some cases, a disk can pinch the sciatic nerve. A pinched sciatic nerve can cause pain along the nerve, into the buttocks on one side, down the hamstring, on the outer side of the lower leg all the way to the foot. That pain, called sciatica, is also associated with numbness and tingling in one leg. Go see a doctor if you feel tingling or numbness.

The completed memorial, which will open to the families of victims in a Sept. 11 ceremony and to the public on Sept. 12, pairs the vast scale and emptiness of the tower footprints with a park-like landscape of 416 swamp white oak trees. That combination reflects the tricky path Arad and Walker have had to walk here, producing both a memorial to destruction and a usable park for a part of Manhattan that has grown increasingly residential since 2001.
øThe Tulsa Shock- which was a league-worst 3-31 last season and has just nine wins in two seasons since moving from Detroit Shock- picks fourth, followed by the San Antonio Silver Stars, Phoenix Mercury, New York Liberty and Indiana Fever. Then Lynx then pick again to close the first round, and - thanks to several other trades - also have the sixth, seventh and eighth selections of the second round, giving them five picks in the first 20.
"I was kind of confused by that," Pulfer said. "There were other guys doing the same things I was doing, and I was worried like, 'Is he just picking on me?' But I think he was just trying to get the best out of me, and I know I'm better than that."

Sanchez's take on street foods - Sopes ($6.99) and Empanadas de Carnitas ($7.99) - is exactly right. Fried masa (corn dough) looks and tastes as though it were made with lard; the refried beans topping the sopes and meat stuffing the empanadas are salty, rich and addictive.

Shelter medicine has changed dramatically in the past 10 years, Barkley says. Animals that weren’t immediately ready for adoption were often euthanized rather than treated.

Several distributors and home winemakers liked what they tasted and began to ask for grapes and juice. They'd been buying Napa Valley grapes and juice, but prices were rising and supplies were tightening.

That's their comfort zone, and they're reluctant to be weaned from it, even though many of the more exciting wines to enter the market these days are blends labeled without a varietal designation.

Still, the evening’s best moments were provided by artists who were willing to stretch out and let their songs develop. Drake, whose set sometimes felt like a Young Money Records exhibition, saved his best for last: a solo performance of “Over,” the lead single from his upcoming debut. “Over” requires Drake to express surprise, annoyance and bewilderment at his sudden success; given space to act, he sold the complicated sentiment to the crowd. Ludacris’ solid performance was structured like a mainstream pop concert: hit after discrete hit, with explanatory introductions setting up the songs. And Fabolous surprised the audience — and maybe even earned himself a reputation as a risk-taker — by rapping over a hard-rock band.

You could end bullying by behaving like an adult and expressing disapproval of bullying behavior — and stop watching those damn reality shows!

Arda: I think because The Rock is returning for WrestleMania 28, on top of the fact that he is in great shape and certainly has more than a handful of top-level matches left in him, it seems likely more than ever that the "passing of the torch" that many are predicting won't actually happen. For the first time in a larger-than-life WrestleMania main event, we may see interference. Say someone like The Miz costs Cena the match. The Rock wins and is strong going into his next match in WWE when he returns, Cena has a new rivalry to occupy him post WrestleMania, and someone (like Miz) is elevated to main-event level once again. It feels right for something like that to happen. Give me The Rock with a Rock Bottom and the 1-2-3 after some interference by The Miz.

And I don't think it's a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of America's environment.
