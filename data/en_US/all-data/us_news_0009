The renaissance of Shaker Square as a food destination seems to be in full swing. Chef Sergio Abramof's Sarava anchors the culinary delights to be found on the northeast quadrant. Inspired by the flavors of the chef's native Brazil, Sarava's cuisine fills a rare niche on the local dining scene. Traditional dishes such as feijoada (a rich black-bean stew with sausage and pork) and xim xim(a slow-braised stew of chicken, shrimp, coconut milk and peppers) are as authentically exotic to our palates as they are satisfyingly homey. The "street plates" are where the menu really shines. It's easy to fill a table, tapas-style, with dishes such as tamale cakes, artichoke fritters, chicken passarinho (pan-seared chicken morsels in a garlic-scallion sauce). The substantial and spicy stewed calamari plate is practically a meal in itself. Sarava also delivers a sexy and foreign-seeming atmosphere, especially in the dimly lit, high-ceilinged bar area. South American beats provide the perfect soundtrack for sipping a caipirinha cocktail and nibbling the night away.

With West Virginia out of the picture (and the Scarlet Knight’s 17 game losing streak to them), Rutgers and Louisville will most likely be the media favorites. Rutgers will get Louisville at home and essentially replaces a trip to Morgantown with a trip to Philadelphia to play Temple - where as the road team Scarlet Knight fans could equal and perhaps outnumber Owl fans. This is not to say this schedule is not without its speed bumps. South Florida is notorious for playing well in September, having knocked off the likes of Florida State and Notre Dame in recent years only to take a swan dive in the latter months of the season. Rutgers has not won in Cincinnati in three tries during Big East play. Couple this with back-to-back road trips with Pittsburgh following the Cincinnati game and the USF game will carry even more significance. Should Rutgers prevail in Tampa and knock off their two local rivals at home in Connecticut and Syracuse, they will give themselves a cushion against the Bearcats and Pittsburgh should they lose to one of those two. Providing USF doesn’t win out after the early loss to the Scarlet Knights, even with one conference loss for Rutgers the Cardinals would have no way of clinching before the Thursday night matchup.
Next, at the University of Pennsylvania, Muybridge studied movement, photographing animals and people with banks of cameras.

His comments reflected more of an acceptance and determination than any real optimism. I'm not even sure there's much to "believe," really. Unless you're talking about something specific.

On Sept. 12, 2001, I wrote a letter to The Sun hoping (praying) that my nation would respond to the Sept. 11 attacks with swift justice rather than protracted war; that we would thoughtfully and strategically aim to increase peace rather than compound violence. We've been warring for 10 years now, and at such cost of lives and treasure — over 5,000 American soldiers and many, many times that in civilian deaths and hundreds of billions of dollars.

If show business is a crash course in rejection -- "You don't look right for the role." "Your voice is wrong for that song." "The network executives don't like you." -- comedy is especially challenging. Getting the gig is only the beginning. Then comes the part where you go out and try to make a roomful of strangers laugh. A theater audience can fake being interested, simply by being quiet and staying awake. But a comedy audience has to react to let the performer know if he or she is doing a good job. There's no coasting; you make 'em laugh, or you don't.

Robertson shared conducting duties for this one-off program with resident conductor Ward Stare. The opening work was Charles Ives' "Central Park in the Dark," conducted by both men, Stare on stage with the strings, Robertson in the lobby with everyone else. The strings offer the sounds of the quiet darkness in the park; the other instruments represent everything from a nightclub to a hansom cab's crash. It's a very American piece, a different kind of tone-painting, and it was played to sometimes noisy perfection.

"Unquestionably, use of Florida public record laws by the media (in general and not just the interveners here) has become simply a tool to tell a story. It is time that Florida's public records laws recognize this fact and steps be taken to examine whether the laws are too broad and whether the release of certain information is causing more harm or whether the public's and media's right to know outweighs that harm."

The real issue is not his coarse reaction to a young woman, who obviously has no personal shame. This woman is not just a law student. Every since she set foot on Georgetown's Catholic campus this "sexual activist" has been plotting and scheming to get the Catholic Church to renounce one of its most controversial teachings. That makes her a fifth columnist with an agenda and she is using the members of the press to advance her cause to the detriment of my Catholic faith.

"I was playing with a big brace on my knee, which is really uncomfortable. I wasn't 100 percent. From Dec. 10 till now, I think I'm a completely different player."

I thought we couldn't afford matching furniture or Hummel figurines, and that my mom was too tired to create those snow-scenes on the windows. But I grew up to realize that my mother had something better than money; she had taste. She painted and sketched and made clothes so beautiful that after her memorial service, one of my sister's friends wept as she told me about the elegance of the French seams my mother put inside a formal she'd sewn for her as a gift. Today, years after she's gone, my brother, sister and I have my mom's paintings on the walls of our homes.

Anatolia really comes into its own in the entree category. The chefs are expert at grilling and roasting, and the mixed grill ($22.95) amply demonstrates that skill with a delectable sampling of juicy lamb and chicken kebabs, adana (chopped lamb deliciously spiced, shaped and grilled on a skewer), and lamb doner, the Turkish version of the Greek gyro or Lebanese shwarma. Anatolias doner is classic: crispy on the outside, succulent and tender on the inside. -- Beth Segal
Bailey observed how Groupon, with its nearly 11,500 employees, is an extraordinarily labor-intensive operation. With an annual revenue rate of $172,000 per employee, Groupon compares with the old-economy stalwart R.R. Donnelley and Sons (RRD), while Google records revenue per employee of $1 million, Bailey said. Shinal said Groupon is looking like the Pets.com of the latest tech craze. He said its greatest success has been to stage sales to pre-IPO investors that allowed Mason, Lefkofsky and their venture-capital backers to cash out handsomely "while creating no value for common shareholders."

Heart health: An August study in the journal Circulation found that small amounts of moderately paced leisure activity — as little as 20 minutes a day — lowered people's risk of coronary heart disease by 14%. The paper, which pooled data from 33 studies, found that higher activity levels lowered the risk more than light activity did. But even those who got less than 150 minutes of exercise a week (the minimum amount recommended by the government's 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans) had a lower risk than did those who were sedentary.

A problem with both K2 and bath salts is that while the chemicals have been made illegal in Michigan, the fact these "lab drugs" are someone's chemistry project allows them to change the chemical make up and skirt the law after testing is done by our MSP crime labs. The Michigan House and Senate both have bills that would give the State Department of Community Health the authority to temporarily categorize substances such as K2 and so-called "bath salts" as an imminent danger to the health and lives of Michigan residents as controlled substances. This would allow the new chemical make up, when identified, to be subject to Michigan drug enforcement laws.

In regard to "Envisioning I-70 as a toll road" (Jan 18), I was troubled by the cost of the toll road to motorists. Ten to fifteen cents per mile is insane. Even more troubling is the tripling of the cost to our trucking companies. Did the Missouri Department of Transportation take into consideration the amount of students who travel back and forth to the several universities on the I-70 corridor between St. Louis and Kansas City? As the parent of a student at the University of Missouri in Columbia, I know my child does not have the means to pay $30.00 every time he makes a 200 mile round trip from our home in St. Charles to the university. Did the Transportation Dept. take into consideration the cost to the small towns along this route who will ultimately suffer if this toll road comes to fruition? Motorists will not be able to afford the extra cost of visiting these small communities that depend on consumers for their livelihood. Towns, such as Hermann and Fulton, who depend on the tourism trade will be adversely affected. The overall cost to these communities, as well as the state itself, will be enormous. Motorists from our state, as well as others, might decide the cost of the toll roads far outweigh the desire to visit our state for the many amenities we provide. The Lake of the Ozarks and all of the towns along the way will lose many tourists to other recreational sites in other states. Carlyle Lake in Illinois and Rend Lake in Kentucky come to mind as areas that are in close proximity to the St. Louis area and offer many of the same recreational amenities that are available at the Lake of the Ozarks.

"It's easy for doctors and patients to only focus on the benefits of new drugs like Avastin, and to ignore the side effects, " Meropol said. "Even though Avastin is very well-tolerated, there are some uncommon but serious side effects.

øA: You have to have a much longer-term viewpoint. First, you have to change your guidepost. Ask yourself, how much money do I need when I retire? You have to have a strong belief, if you're in good health, that you will live to probably your mid-80s. And if you're a couple who are in your 60s and in good health, statistically, one of the two of you will live to 92. So you need adequacy in your nest egg when you retire to meet those financial needs as you live longer. People today are preoccupied in trying to live a better, longer life. They may be exercising more, taking vitamins, having regular examinations. We do that because we want to live longer. We're so preoccupied with finding a lifestyle that allows us to live longer and more successfully, but we don't take that same horizon when we invest for our retirement. What I'm trying to suggest is once you start to say, I need X dollars in retirement, then you work backwards. You're not going to earn that with zero interest in cash. You're going to need some form of returns, and there are areas where you can earn 4%, 5%, 6% type of returns over a course of a long time, and that's generally shares of dividend-paying companies and other forms of credit such as high-yield and other products that will give you a higher return than cash. So if you needed, let's say, $40,000 pretax to live by or $55,000 pretax to live by, work backwards. Depending on your life, your age, how much money do you need to put away? What type of return do you need to earn to build that nest egg? And I think too few people are focusing on that.
Graduates, in heavy debt, can't find decent jobs. Our infrastructure (roads, bridges, etc.) is falling apart. Yet we still are actually spending $3 billion or more a month for our worldwide military involvement. How about withdrawing our troops from South Korea, Japan, Germany and the dozen other worldwide locations? The money we are blowing on military adventures could really help at home.

Hey, Josh: If Thomas made the Pro Bowl in each of his first 10 years in the NFL, that would be a pretty good opening argument for induction into the Hall of Fame.

Tooloulou doesn't have an official dessert menu, but it serves milkshakes and root beer floats made with ice cream from Prigel Family Creamery. During our visit, the dessert special was strawberry shortcake made with Lagergren's sweet biscuits ,which were the size of a salad plate, fresh strawberries and barely whipped sweet cream ($6). The shortcake teetered on the edge of sweet —- some of us thought it should be more sugary — but the biscuit alone, with its tender texture and slight crumble, was worth the price (and the calories).

This one, made with turkey links which Hillshire Farms (gomeat.com) plumps with pepper Jack cheese, is marinated along with fresh veggies in fajita-flavored ingredients.

It is vital that you sit down with a school counselor and ask if he is on track to finish in three years if he needed to. How would he compare to the students in the class above him? The counselor will need to give a recommendation for private schools, so it is important to know if he will get his school's support. If it seems like this path is appropriate, sit down and create a balanced college list. If he will only graduate early if he gets into certain programs, then the list can be aggressive, but don't make this list without great thought. If he gets the offers and instead decides to stay that last year of high school, that is OK. In fact, if he is accepted into a college of his dreams, he can ask if the school will defer enrollment for one year -- some will require that he reapply.

Unfortunately, this may all change if we don't take action. The administration's proposed budget for the 2013 fiscal year -- now in front of Congress -- includes a devastating 20 percent cut to planetary funding. A cut of that scale will eliminate several Mars missions, break international agreements that jointly support other missions, eliminate any large-scale "flagship" missions for the foreseeable future and force us to abandon any plans to explore the potential habitability of the "water moons" Europa and Enceladus, circling Jupiter and Saturn.

Anyway, as I'm driving Saturday, I'm thinking how ironic it is that my first trip up here was to visit a blind man, and now I was going to see a blind judo competition. In the Whittier Christian High School gym I find Carlos and the third-annual Friendship Games. The tournament is run by Donnand Julie Hearn, who own the Akida Martial Arts Academy in Buena Park. It was Carlos who four years ago saw a blind girl aggressively playing some schoolyard game and told Donn he should get her into his classes. The girl was Danyelle Cerillo, now a sophomore at Sunny Hills High, and she is in the tourney. I ask her about competing against sighted kids.

Gosselin, who has called TLC a "monster" and blamed the network for destroying his marriage, is an "exclusive" employee, which means he can't accept payment from other sources to talk about his situation. It's not clear which news outlets paid Gosselin to tell his side of the story, but he has appeared in recent weeks on "Entertainment Tonight," "The Insider" (where he was subjected to a brutal smackdown by Nancy Grace), and CNN's "Larry King Live."
Butterfield considers himself "a pretty good student," currently immersed in photography and music (he plays piano, guitar and drums) as well as the usual subjects during the one-hour-of-work, one-hour-of-school on-set schedule. That helped when Scorsese gave him "homework" as well — movies to watch to familiarize himself with the early-film era that concerns "Hugo," and other movies that inspired the director. No studying, however, could prepare Butterfield for the emotional demands of playing an orphan sustaining himself in a Parisian train station.
And she did learn, from many people, from many parts of Mexico. Wong Fillmore, a working linguist and retired UC Berkeley professor of education, estimates that she has made more than 75,000 tamales.

One acquaintance, favoring privacy, said that if the worst were to happen to her husband and someone wielding a camera dared to elbow in on her family's grief, she'd "open up a can of Army wife whoop-ass." The image of the modern military spouse is half-frontier wife, half-Care Bear -- by turns stoically able and cooingly comforting. But when it comes to acting on behalf of our kin and the larger military family, make no mistake: Wives are warriors too.

"We want to make sure folks are rested and safe when they are working," Richter said. "When you have too much availability of overtime it starts to burn out your staff."
Yes, yes, after seeing the pilot, the network wanted to ramp up the action. We had a little bit, but they wanted more, which is kind of ironic because the original script had a very elaborate car chase and I thought, 'Oh, that will be fun,' but by the time we began shooting, it was gone, of course, for budget reasons. But now we have another action sequence in the pilot, which I think is actually better. I hope you liked it. It's the one in the gas station — it was fun.

Road Rant checked out a few complaints and found that there's indeed a darkness on the edge of town.
Lucy, an aging German shorthair, stood rigid as a statue, her stubbed tail plank straight as she locked onto the scent of chukar partridge seeking cover in the summer switchgrass. From a distance, the stalemate appeared common enough among the upland bird community with a preference for running with pointing breeds. But from dog owner Buzz Butler's vantage point at Lucy's flank, the view was nothing short of astounding.

Many of the groups aiming at Obama are tax-exempt advocacy groups that do not disclose their donors and are running so-called issue ads, which do not explicitly call for a candidate's defeat or election.

You order at the counter at this crazy-quilt colorful eatery blooming with bright landscape paintings, parrot sculptures, mural-topped communal tables and bouncy Mexican music, but that doesn't mean fast food.

The U.S. Department of Labor is responsible for the Cleveland Job Corps Academy, which has operated in the city for four decades. It moved to a $35 million, 25-acre campus in Collinwood in 2007. It gets noticed only when politicians visit the campus or a student success story is celebrated.

The poor play, along with the league's second-highest goalkeeper salary at $200,000 (Seattle's Kasey Keller earned $300,000) last season, prompted D.C. United to move Perkins.

The strangest situation was when I was stopped for speeding by the notoriously corrupt police. When the officer pulled me over, I pretended I didn't understand Spanish, hoping he might give up and just let me go. I ended up going native. I gave the officer enough money to treat himself and his senora to a steak dinner, then was allowed to go on my way. Of course, no ticket was issued. It was both frightening and amusing.

I've thought about that phrase quite a bit in recent days - the character of our country. One of the unique and wonderful things about America has always been our self-reliance, our rugged individualism, our fierce defense of freedom and our healthy skepticism of government. And figuring out the appropriate size and role of government has always been a source of rigorous and sometimes angry debate.

“I’ve rarely heard veterans use the word ‘hero,’ and never in relation to themselves. Veterans don’t really talk about their combat experiences much — they talk about it with each other, or perhaps during therapy, but it’s not something they often speak of. And in a way I wish they would.”
Is the DNR infected with the pernicious demolitionitis that the City proper seems to have?

And despite the fact that pastors never work harder than during this week-four sermons in four days, anyone?-I suspect most of my fellow clergy would feel the same way. Holy Week is the reason we do this. Jesus' suffering, death, and resurrection is the heart of Christian faith. Without it, we'd have no reason to get together at all.
Spokesman Chris Hibbs says the switch has less to do with money than giving game-goers greater variety - concession stands will sport eight flavors rather than six - and Dr Pepper Snapple Group's willingness to invest in new kinds of retail and in-stadium marketing, including opening a Dr Pepper Patio next to the new pro shop where fans can hang out and watch game highlights on a giant video screen and eat and drink new concession goodies. One idea is a portable drink station with all of Dr Pepper Snapple Group's beverages, including Diet Rite cola, Canada Dry, Hawaiian Punch, Country Time lemonade, Squirt citrus drink and Yoo-Hoo Chocolate.

Investigating officers told the court how he shot his victims, beginning with a security official on the island and then 68 others, mostly the youth who were participating in the summer retreat.
Write it down. If you're doing an internship for credit, you'll probably be asked to create a portfolio of your work to be graded. But take the time to do what Sarah Jackson did when she was doing her internship at the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site. The McKendree University junior kept a log of what she did, but also of what she learned. It's a great way to chart your progress and to reinforce the knowledge or skills you've gained.

Jessica: If we're in the office, we start with coffee or tea and a meeting. This is new, because as a small creative business it's easy to be pulled in a million different directions. We make a road map of the day and connect it to the week and our overall goals. It sucks, but it's necessary. There's the usual: email, blogs, social media. Then, there's the unusual: feeding our cockroaches, tarantulas and scorpions. We schedule workshops in schools and libraries, and the occasional birthday party. If we have a new video project, we spend our day scripting and/or editing stock footage. Filming days are simultaneously the most stressful and the most fun. We have to find places to film, avoid the rain, and often dress up in homemade insect costumes to film mating and courtship sequences. Right now our goal is setting up a WebTV show for our videos. We have no idea how to do that, so if any ONN readers have advice on that, we'd love to hear it!
But now that Hall of Fame business will be tough sledding. As the central character in the Mitchell Report and with Clemens' trainer Brian McNamee and Pettitte both providing enough evidence to confirm it, we all know he is a drug cheat and that will likely keep him, Bonds, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and all the other big names of the Steroid Era out of Cooperstown.
