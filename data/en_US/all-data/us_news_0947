This unwelcome intrusion was, mercifully, over quick. It was still a waste of precious time that could have been better used by keeping the spotlight on Madonna, a pop star who has never need any help from her peers to get attention from audiences. Super Bowl halftime shows are generally a sprint -- musicians attempt to cram as much flash and gratuitous spectacle into the allotted twelve minutes as possible, and are forced to perform attenuated versions of greatest hits.

Much of the opera's success depends on not answering our questions about the ghosts or the reliability of the Governess, Muni says.

But the story at the crossroads of advertising and sexuality that got my attention last week was CBS's decision not to air a Super Bowl ad for gay dating service ManCrunch.com.

"It hurts the team but the No. 1 person it hurts the most, and I’ve been through three of them, is Marian Hossa. That’s his life. And his life’s changed. There’s no doubt about it. It’s changed and obviously it’s changed where he’s not healthy and in pain and it’s changed in the fact that he’s much more susceptible to another one. It’s changed that maybe he might have issues the rest of his life. It’s changed because it could affect his livelihood. Maybe he’s much more susceptible. Maybe a team’s not going to take that risk on him anymore because of that.”
The mistake I made was that one outlet had become a livelihood, and that one thing couldn’t be enough for everything. The goal is to not replace or leave anything behind; it's to invite more into my world so I can feel like I'm still making music for the reasons I started. I have pretty eclectic tastes and a short attention span to the music I make. I want to challenge myself. That requires different projects and collaborations. I'm working with a lot of people. That way, I’m not being complacent anymore.

He has faith in the organization's ability to maintain a competitive roster, and he is motivated to win another Stanley Cup. Lidstrom, however, is not sure if he still has the drive, after 20 NHL seasons, to train the way he needs to over the summer to be prepared for another long and grinding season.

The menu, like almost every other these days, offers several raw fish dishes. Marinated yellowfin tuna ($13)paves a white plate, with the arrangements of beets, radishes and lemon oil drizzles looking like a psychedelic bonsai garden.

"The thing I've tried to point out to Ty is — his best games this year, he's been rebounding," Karl said today. "His best game, by far, was at San Antonio, he had nine rebounds. Another game he had eight. I've said this a lot to my son (Coby, who plays basketball overseas) — rebounding is a motivating thing to a playmaker. People don't know that, but a rebounder who can push the fast break becomes a great playmaker, because there is more space, speed and time to make your decision. Ty has got to help us rebound the ball, because when he does, our efficiency rating goes off the chart. Same thing with Andre Miller, same thing with Danilo Gallinari."

I think Liuget would be a great pick for the Bears. He clearly is the third best defensive tackle in the draft, but he's an ideal fit for the Bears' scheme.

But they have had some duds from Champaign as well. Remember David Williams? The Bears picked him in the third round and cut him before the season began. Interestingly, he was the last Illinois player the team drafted -- and that was 25 years ago.

With only Blake and Christina left to battle it out for the last members of their team, Adley seemed like a shoo-in for both -- a country girl from Oklahoma who has only been singing for about 10 months but has pipes.

It kind of sounds like make or break for both quarterbacks and their coach, too. If it works, all three will be embraced by the New York fans and media.

Skynet has not become self-aware, but it's hard to escape the feeling that we're heading for a "Terminator"-like future in which intelligent machines start wanting to run the show, what with cellphones that can talk to us and websites that can peg our entertainment preferences with eerie accuracy.

Twedt portrays Scout as both a six-year-old tomboy (her childhood voice is remarkable) and her grown-up version Jean Louise, who narrates the story as it unfolds. Also, Jeff Gorham, as a sturdy, appealing Atticus, plays no other character, and as the best-developed figure onstage, he's central to the action, a stern but loving father to Scout and her brother, a even-tempered lawyer with a tough case on his hands.

Imagine walking out of 2012 and into a courtroom from the pre-laptop era. Court clerks fill out dockets, then pull apart five carbon copies to hand to attorneys, who shake their heads in disgust and go back to their offices to re-enter the data in modern, usable formats.

Putting one foot in front of the other, hour after hour, day after day, pulled us into the present like nothing else I've done. History was everywhere: in seaside caves graffitied with 5th century Pictish glyphs, in medieval castles featured in Shakespeare plays, in clearings where the last witch was burned in 1644. Where history is so palpable, death seems closer, inviting you to contemplate your own, or that of those closest to you.

That is, starting in 2013, the General Assembly will let gamblers deny perhaps $40 million a year to Ohio's General Revenue Fund -- the main state-budget account. That's the General Revenue Fund likely to have an $8 billion hole (probably more) by July 2011 because of a crummy economy and all the one-time money Democrats and Republicans alike agreed to spend in Ohio's 2009-11 budget.
That said, the race I completed nine days ago in Sandusky represents something new, at least for me. That's because, as a half ultra-distance event, the race was twice as long as any triathlon I'd completed previously: 1.2 miles in the water, 56 miles on the bike, and 13.1 miles on foot.

Population growth isn't necessarily the best measure of a region's health, but it is telling. Americans go where they believe they can find jobs and opportunities. That in-migration, in turn, replenishes the energy, creativity and wealth of those lucky places. For much of the last century, Greater Cleveland benefited from that dynamic. But for too long, as Brent Larkin noted in his column a few weeks ago, we have been getting older, smaller and poorer. That dynamic also feeds on itself.

The new bill doesn't require showing an ID or even bringing one to the polling place. Ms. Afzali says she made that change in response to concerns that the ID requirement might intimidate some voters and depress turnout. Instead, the new bill would allow citizens arriving at the polls to simply give their name and address, which elections officials could then verify through computer records at the Motor Vehicle Administration or other state agency. Voters who didn't have a driver's license or state identification on file could vote by substituting a utility bill or other official correspondence to prove they are who they say they are.

Yet that's no call for complacency. Should the trust fund actually be allowed to become insolvent, seniors could see their benefits cut by 25 percent immediately. The nation's elderly should not have to contemplate such a disaster for the politicians to become properly motivated to embrace some modest changes to the system.
The St. Louis event, scheduled for June 23, is eight weeks away, and more than 4,200 people have registered.

However, all in all it's a brilliant menu, supported by professional servers dressed in white shirts and black vests, and a setting that overlooks the Ferry Building. The restaurant's interior, which seats up to 140 in the dining room, 40 in the bar and up to 200 for private parties, can feel somewhat cold and corporate. Still, a re-do a few years ago, and the expansion in the neighborhood, have given One Market a more vibrant feel.

His sobering, entirely believable conclusion is that we've veered from the path of good sense in many ways, and have allowed considerations of politics and political correctness to obscure objective scientific realities and, worse yet, to prohibit us from questioning the very policies that stand in the way of recovering our stride.

PRESIDENT ROMNEY ALREADY? With all due respect to anyone in the Presidential campaign catbird seat, it, to me, was amusing to learn presumptive Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, is already offering his post-inuaguration gifts to anyone who contributes at least $50,000 to his campaign. In next week's STAR TRIBUNE webcast, I'll opine about Romney possibly not paying attention to over-confidence in previous presidential campaigns. The most classic, in my opinion, was New York Goevernor Thomas E. Dewey's 1948 bid for the White House against incumbent President Harry Truman. I remember Mr. Dewey's over-confidence boiling over during the last few days of the campaign. I also remember The Chicago Tribune's infamous front page headline the morning after the election, in its earliest editions: DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN. Regardless of politics, it was fun to see the newly-elected President Truman holding up that newspaper with it's erroneous and presumptuous headline, smiling as broadly as anyone could, and justifiably so. Mr. Romney, although certain to be the Republican nominee, hands down, might still want to be a bit more humble regarding his presumptive win.
† He should stand ready to make further job-creating investments in our crumbling infrastructure and renew his call for an infrastructure bank.

In 2009, the body of 21-year-old Chesterfield Township resident Matthew Landry, who was kidnapped from a Quiznos in Eastpointe, was found shot in the head in a vacant house near Denby. Landry's murder drew attention to the problem of abandoned homes, and a year after his death, the city demolished the house where his body was found.

Johnson, the police officer, didn't agree with Ginsberg. He told the judge the red-light signal lasted 26 seconds, which would put Ginsberg into the intersection before it turned green.

Sheraton Waikiki-Royal Hawaiian: Waikiki has always been a place for small, pretty pools better for lounging than swimming. Water slides? Go to an outer island resort. All that changed this year with the arrival of a pool with slides and waterfalls wedged between the venerable Royal Hawaiian and the high-rise Sheraton Waikiki. Some find it architectural blasphemy. As a parent, it’s a welcome addition. Best of all, it’s just steps to the famous waves “On the Beach at Waikiki.”

enough, with an excellent piece of white tuna highlighting the nigiri selection. The regular tuna and yellowtail were solid, which means average.

These are her riffs on the genre, heady, freewheeling pizzas based on a killer dough, a finely tuned knowledge of the wood-burning oven and sheer invention. They're pretty much all terrific. Never over-embellished, just flat out delicious, whether it's her pie topped with radicchio, escarole, guanciale and a molten-centered fried egg or one with graceful tomato sauce, burrata and squash blossoms.

Walleye anglers have had to move to deeper 22- to 25-foot depths to escape the bass bite.

Unfortunately, his vision is sometimes blurred by sloppy execution. The classic lomo saltado ($17), strips of steak wok-fried with loads of onions, tomatoes and french fries, is often a standout, but on a recent visit the chef obliterated the flavors with too much soy sauce.
