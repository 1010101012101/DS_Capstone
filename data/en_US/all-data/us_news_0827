At Cambridge, studying took a back seat to performing. And how could it not with so many future luminaries to inspire him?

• The Knicks need to find the right pace and avoid playing at the Heat's preferred speed, Carmelo Anthony told reporters, as reported by Kevin Armstrong of the Daily News: "To confuse Carmelo Anthony, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra dispatched two, three defenders in his direction, denying the ball and limiting all options.

Attention-grabbers: "You should see my arsenal. Turkey calls, duck calls, squeak toys. That's the fun part of the game, all the toys." Morrissey finds this especially helpful when photographing two or more dogs. It doesn't have to be that complicated, he says. A crinkling empty potato chip bag or empty plastic water bottle can grab their attention. He tries to avoid using treats. "I will if I have to. Some dogs are just treat motivated. But I try not to. It creates saliva, and a ruly dog sometimes will become unruly if they're just fixated on a treat."

Cut the spring at 3 inches and hot glue it to the bottom portion of the egg, and then inside the top. Let the glue harden. Add eyes and other embellishments and glue to the base. Use the pipe cleaners to make funky arms.

The truth is, illegal immigrants are generally quite clever at remaining undetected. The fact that no one can reasonably claim to be able to tell the difference between those who are here legally and those who are not just by looking is simply an excuse to treat all people of a different skin color or national origin as criminals.
But that is the beauty of what Tyree did in Super Bowl XLII, his transformation from obscurity to legend with one impossible catch. Without the help of Nostradamus, it would be just as impossible to pick the next Tyree off this Giants roster. Still, there’s no harm in trying.
Chief among those is that three years after the onset of a downturn that devastated employment at near-Great Depression levels, an astounding number of displaced workers have yet to grasp that the search methods of yesteryear are doomed to fail in the 21st century.

But for some reason, many of my strongest memories of Manning are from darker times and how he handled them. The 41-0 embarrassment to the New York Jets in a 2002 wild-card playoff game. The 24-14 loss at New England in the '03 AFC Championship Game. The 20-3 loss to the Patriots the next season.

The Broncos did stop their slide at home — consecutive losses at the end of last year (and defeats in four of the final five games here).

If there's one name that is synonymous with 1980s America, it's Ronald Reagan. He was elected in 1980 and served as president until 1989.

Destination pools. Customers today don't want a stand-alone pool; they want a whole outdoor living area with entertaining space and an outdoor kitchen.

I've got everything from news apps to Flight Board to TweetDeck to games such as Temple Run, RealRacing2HD, Pocket Passer, Air Hockey and Waste Paper Basketball Diaries on the iPad.

To play music and have it generate something positive, that's a really fulfilling thing.

Blame for the problems that led to the rescue has been placed firmly with the two main political parties that governed Greece over the past four decades — conservative New Democracy and Socialist PASOK — both of whom have been accused of uncontrolled overspending, cronyism and lack of accountability.

As the narrator goes back and forth between his first experience of Wade (as a not-quite-stepfather) and his last, we get a sense of the older man's hold on the younger's imagination, but also an idea of how dubious that hold might be. Early on, in fact, there's a wonderful exchange about Wade's plans, where the narrator says, "You speak German?" and Wade answers, "Sure, I was a German major ... I mean, I didn't finish, but sure." Challenged, Wade says, "You studied German?" to which the narrator responds, "Not really. I took a couple years in high school."

Some of the new faces are familiar.
Putting across a premise as fantastical as this film's requires top-flight acting, as well as a kind of poker face, and that's precisely what the movie delivers. While there's no shortage of humor in the film, it has to take its conceit seriously enough for us to trail along behind, but not too far behind: What Colter is discovering along the way the viewer is discovering, too, and Mr. Gyllenhaal, whose performances are usually constrained and internalized, gets to freestyle: At some point during his return trips to the train, Colter decides no one there really exists and he can act as crazily as he needs if it means ferreting out the killer. He goes a bit off the rails, in a manner of speaking.

Maybe these aren't an exact replica of those meatball sandwiches from back in Philly, but these were pronounced "excellent" by my Philly-born husband, and that's good enough for me.

We've covered well over 300 miles thus far, and the dogs are running like they are just starting to get warmed up. Today was a shorter day, but also one of our more difficult on the trail.

And now that we are in the metro area, the trails themselves are becoming more and more interesting. Today in Forest Lake we had to traverse a shopping mall parking lot. It was a new experience for all of us.

(On Marcus Benard development as a defensive end)- "Me, personally, I think Marcus is a defensive end. You can talk about the 3-4, 4-3 all that stuff, but he's definitely not a 4-3 linebacker, I don't think. He can do it in a pinch, but I think he's a defensive end.

Obviously, we all know he can rush the passer, but if he's going to be rotating in there, he has to be able to play the run too and I think he can do that."
"You have to be willing to compromise," he said.

If the right will intentionally, and often successfully, mischaracterize the president like this, you might say: What does he have to lose? Why not embrace that image? What if he spoke out brazenly, took a non-negotiable stand? What if he fired up people and truly earned the hatred of the right for a change?

But how else can you explain it? How do you explain that in six Browns games this season, Hillis has already missed one game because of strep throat, a full game and half of another with a strained left hamstring, and reaggravated his injury after returning to practice this week so that his status for Sunday's contest in San Francisco is in doubt?

2. Rory McIlroy, Northern Ireland -- A year ago, McIlroy skipped the Players Championship after Chubby Chandler, then his agent, called it "the ninth or 10th most important tournament in the world." When he joined the PGA Tour before this season, he said he would again play in what the PGA Tour would rather be called "The Fifth Major," and he made it official with a commitment last week. He has played at TPC Sawgrass only twice, in 2009 and 2010, failing to break the par of 72 in any of his four rounds while missing the cut both times. When he left two years ago, he said the Stadium Course simply does not fit his game. … Rory is taking three weeks off before playing in the Wells Fargo Championship, the week before the Players. He will turn 23 on Friday at Quail Hollow, where he claimed the first of his three PGA Tour victories in 2010. McIlroy might enter the tournament as the No. 1 player in the World Golf Rankings, having taken over the spot last week without firing a shot after Luke Donald tied for 37th in the RBC Heritage. Donald could get it back this week in New Orleans. … Whatever caused his 77-76 weekend at the Masters, which left him in a tie for 40th, McIlroy probably was overdue for an off week, ill-timed as it was. Before that, he had finished in the top five 11 times in his previous 12 tournaments, including victories in the UBS Hong Kong Open and the Honda Classic. The only time he didn't, he tied for 11th in the Dubai World Championship, where he was suffering from the effects of dengue fever.

Wendell Maxey: Earl Barron is one of those 10-day contract guys Portland has had their eye on for a while now and were fortunate to sign for the rest of the season. But he still falls into the "not really sure what to make of his game until we see significant run" category. Even still, you almost have to dig Earl for his size alone and ability to mix in on both ends of the floor. Plus Barron has an NBA title to boast, so he's got that going for him.
