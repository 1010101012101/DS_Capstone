Within minutes of the CodeRED alert being issued, a family member of the child had received one of the emergency alert calls and contacted police, who then reunited the parents with their child.
But after I broke down and bought it, I discovered that it made for a nice soundtrack for partaking in what was becoming my daily sacrament for the remainder of my high school career.
My blog friend Joan, used these Ikea Henriksdal armchairs in her breakfast room. While they're meant for dining, the scale is actually very appropriate to my living room. The chair is comfortable, but, I have had hard time finding these chairs in Ikea's near me. We'll be in Boston in a couple of weeks, and I'll keeping my fingers crossed that they'll have one or two. If not,

Throne of Glass by Sarah Maas is their lead title, a debut fantasy from a twenty-five year old American (don't you just hate her already?) about a female assassin in a tournament against male opponents, out in August in the UK. Pre-publication there will be four e-novellas to set readers up for the main book.
Before Renae was born, I read the book "Babywise." I thought so many aspects of it were great. Then I had Renae and quickly threw some of it out the window. Although there are some good tips in there, what I caught loud and clear from the book is that many times when your child is crying, they are just being manipulative and bad. Well, I can't agree with that 100% of the time, especially after having 2 children! As I've talked with other Moms about that book, many people heard the same message that I heard, despite the fact that there are lots of other (and some not so great) good tips in the book. So what's the lesson?

Place the eggs and sugar in a metal bowl and combine with a whisk. Place the bowl with the eggs and sugar over a pan of simmering water. With the whisk, stir the eggs constantly until they reach about 100F which is just above body temperature. Make sure the sugar has broken down and you can tell this by rubbing a bit of the batter between your thumb and first finger to see if you can feel any sugar granules. If you do then continue stirring just a minute or so more making sure you don't curdle the eggs by over heating them.

Every year, around this time on a Sunday the London Marathon happens and every year I am stuck at home subjected to 7 hours or more of sweaty runners and sweaty on lookers cheering and drinking beer. Such an activity was fun when I was five and I could get some face painting done, having grown up since then I am now faced with a problem. I can’t bloody get out of the Isle of Dogs on a Sunday every exit is blocked, so do I go out and crash at a friends the night before or allow myself to be subjected to this sweaty mass of perpetrators? Each year I ask myself this and each year a decision must be made.

A face emerged from the skinny twig and took on the characteristics of a male human, but none like Mellie had ever seen. He had hair made up in rolls as if it were a powdered, green-silver wig, the same color as the leaves that grew all around his skinny body. His face was long and his forehead high. The twiggy man smiled and said in a distinctly British, albeit breezy, accent, “Do not worry, you are safe.”
I start more charts and designs than I finish. I keep looking for new ideas and things to learn. Sometimes I abandon pieces when I think I've learned what I can. I can only recall one piece I was so angry at the poor quality of the instructions and design that I threw it away in disgust.
I have noticed a change in this year's seed sowing focus, mostly on medicinal herbs and some key produce that is more difficult for us to purchase in bulk, organically. Though we have add a few new items this year, such as parsnips, turnips and tiger melons. Attempting to grow more vertically to save space and increase our yard yields, Yah willing.
With Christmas quickly approaching, I realized I needed to get my butt into gear putting up the few decorations we have. I waited too long to nag Joe to get the fall decorations from the attic (since I’m in such a delicate state and can no longer do it myself), so our house was barren for fall. I didn’t want to make that mistake for Christmas as well.

Guns, Gams, and Gumshoes’ Answer: Statutes provide these permissible uses, or as you said “legal reasons.” For example, the Drivers Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) is a federal law that regulates how information is disseminated (which includes who can access this information) for drivers’ licenses, auto registrations, auto titles, motor vehicle emissions, motor vehicle recalls (and other objects of governmental purposes). Here’s a partial list of who can access DPPA-type information for others: federal, state or local courts and law enforcement in connection with driver safety, theft, emission and product recalls; licensed private investigation or security services; civil, criminal or administrative court proceedings; collection agencies; anyone in possession of written permission from the subject.

When asked whether he has a dream, Joselu says it’s to become a professional footballer in the first division, and hopefully with Madrid, so that he can help his family financially. The interview concludes with Irene asking if he’s “anti” anything, and he responds many things, but none that can be said here, and ends by saying it’s because he’s a big Madrid supporter. Love it, and I hope his dream comes true, both parts of it!
If you deal with the negative emotion when first felt, it is easier to release and therefor does not present as a physical or emotional issue later on. One thing I began doing since I was a small child, was imagining I was melting people when I got angry at them. By the time I was four, I was told I had a dirty look that could melt an iceberg. Even later on in life when I was modeling, a photographer once asked me to give him a “hard, angry look” and when I complied he stopped and came out from behind the camera and said, “Uh…not quite that hard, ok?” Now, I realize what I was doing on an energetic level. I was conveying all through my eyes what I felt I could not say with words. I expressed it and I let it go. I was not wishing harm on the other person. I was merely visualizing the problem melting away. Then everything was cool, and life went on.

* Check fit of the neck piece on a siwash. I check out how snug it is, and I check that the prosternum is at the V. If you put your fingers right at the inside of the V, you should feel the prosternum bone. If you do not, the neck piece is either too big or too small. Too big or too small can pinch a dog's neck.
I currently have one more 4th of July pillow hanging half done on my design wall made from the same fabrics. I should be able to finish it up this week and have both of them done in time, which, for me, is a really big deal! Maybe I'll even get another decoration up or two.

How do you know Cara? We first “met” at the online poetry community Read Write Poem, and when that closed up shop in May 2010, we kept in touch at Big Tent Poetry, a different poetry site, one I also helped manage. Cara came to a “Big Tent” poetry reading at St Johns’ Booksellers in Portland and we met got to meet in person. I still remember that day, and it astounds me (although it shouldn’t) when life and words coalesces like that! All that online energy — and we share the same gorgeous Oregon air!

This is the newest edition to my creamer family. The almond joy variety of coffee creamer (full on dairy creamer…I don’t do the none-dairy thing….I have a vested interest in milk prices these days) has decided to gracce my refrigerator with its presence. I originally developed this addiction to almond joy candy bars when my step-father would bring either almond joys or mounds home (because those are his favorite) after a night of volunteering at the Bingo (volunteers get free food and all the Sundrop their hearts desire…oh to live in simpler, Fancy Farm times). Ever since those days I have been hooked on the delicious coconut, chocolate, almondy treat.

The Grr! Aargh! Monster is the crudely drawn vampire creature that crosses the screen during the end credits of Buffy. It is the mascot of Buffy/Angel creator, Joss Whedon's, Mutant Enemy production company, and apparently, was drawn and voiced by Whedon himself. At the end of each episode, the monster would make its way past the Mutant Enemy logo uttering, "Grr! Aargh!"

Malaprop’s Bookstore/Café, located in Asheville, North Carolina, is a cultural mainstay in one of America’s most vibrant cities.

The notice caused quite a stir in the media and online and The Irish Examiner was keen to find out how the people of Dublin felt about the ‘controversy’. So suitably…eh… inappropriately attired in a navy blue pyjama top and red tartan bottoms I donned my grey bathrobe, put on a newly acquired pair of pink slippers and took to the streets of the capital to ask around.

She sat and watched the debauchery unfolding before her. There were dildos and vibrators strewn all over the room, glistening with juices and lube. She watched with great interest while Maxine got set in her strap on, using a generous amount of lube. She pushed her boyfriend Ken onto all fours, kneeling behind him. Massaging his asshole, she then forced the lubed up cock into his tight tunnel. Kens face contorted in pain for a brief moment. Then, as Maxie developed a slow rhythm, his jaw went slack, and his eyes glazed over in pleasure. Kathryn could hear him grunting as Maxie muttered to him "You like this? You like me fucking you?"

What have we learned? We have learned that so far as the great majority of the members of Christ’s Body are concerned, “the Mystery of Christ,” revealed by the RISEN Christ to the Apostle Paul, is STILL HID! “To whom is it revealed”?

Sunday nights were popcorn nights. Yup, I would just have popcorn for dinner (and leftover popcorn for breakfast on Monday morning). I never made breakfast and didn’t even brew my own coffee. Friends joked that my kitchen was just there for show but that wasn’t true. I did cook for my dog, except when she ate take-out too (hanging head in shame).

Two additional, though implicit, items from Judge Hobgood’s order. First, he appears to have given no serious weight to the argument of Nifong apologist Marcia Morey, who maintained that Cline’s behavior was a mere “distraction to the administration of justice.” Given that Judge Morey had previously claimed that she considered Nifong truthful, she has no credibility on matters of ethics, and Hobgood’s decision not to honor her opinion was appropriate.
I’m not sure that I have any particular style, I like to try different techniques and generally I like to use mist, paint and masks on my Layouts. Well at the moment anyway! I tend to often also add some doodling or inking/distressing to the edges of photo’s or paper on my layouts.

Allie Larkin has written a funny, romantic novel about a woman who watches the longtime love of her life marry her best friend instead. Stay ($25.95, Dutton/Penguin Group) is the story of how she drowns her sorrow initially in Kool-Aid-vodka cocktails and watches reruns of Rin Tin Tin. Then, impulsively, she buys a German shepherd over the Internet. Her new companion, Joe, is a clumsy, slobbering hundred-pound beast that only responds to commands in Slovak! But he helps her begin to mend her broken heart and it doesn’t hurt that Joe’s vet is a rugged sweetheart with floppy blond hair and a winning smile. This is a warm, witty, laugh-out-loud story and a very good debut. Another debut novel is by Brando Skyhorse. In The Madonnas of Echo Park ($23.00, Free Press), just published this month, he gives voice to a Mexican community in Los Angeles not far from Dodger Stadium. We are introduced to and come to know the story of Aurora Esperanza, a young girl caught in the crossfire of a gang shooting with a dozen other girls and mothers while acting out a scene from a Madonna music video. This is straight out of the life of the author, himself a Mexican-American, who knows these people well having been born and raised in Echo Park. This is a very timely story and a moving one that will provide a window into the world of Hispanics.
Hone was born in 1780 on Dutch Street (between John and Fulton streets) and made his name on the nearby ports as an teenage auctioneer selling goods right off the boat. His auction business became known throughout the ports of the new America, and by age 40, the self-made Hone had amassed such wealth that he effectively retired to the life of a "gentleman".

Anyway, at this point, I'd already baked approximately 6 dozen cupcakes, and I just wanted to make two more types. I didn't have any milk, lemons, or canola oil (I couldn't even bake a boxed cake!) and I was running low enough on sugar that I wasn't sure I'd have enough for multiple batches of cupcakes. And so this recipe was born. And it's delicious. If you want to use regular milk, I'd add back in a heading quarter cup of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla extract.

Trainers in a variety of levels. An Associate's degree or an addiction to addition? Maybe you enjoy fixing computer problems, you may want to consider online classes. Many feel it is not a degree. That's right, students: computer science degrees. Though the computer science graduate degree of the computer science graduate degree of Science set, explores six prominent topics in computer technology, so it is best to think about your ultimate goal for the computer science graduate degree. The course trains you in the computer science graduate degree. However, if you understand how a finite automaton works.

I have a bottle of Jack Daniels sitting on a shelf above my computer, its original seal still unbroken. It's the bottle I came home with the day Jill confronted me 22 years ago, and I never opened it. I kept it as a reminder of what Jill did for me that day, and the unbroken seal serves as a sort of trophy for me, a reminder that I faced it head on and I WON. Every once in awhile I take that bottle down from the shelf and look at it. I blow the dust off of it and I run my fingers over the label and wrap my fist around the bottle, and I remember what it felt like to live that life of hopelessness and despair. And I hear the lies in my head, the same lies my brain told me 22 years ago. And then I laugh at my brain and tell it to shut up.

Pubs are like no other business. Perhaps it's as a direct result of them still being, for the now at least, where the majority of beer is consumed. Regular and irregular pub customers almost always have a view on this diverse industry. No one style of pub is going to suit everybody. For some, the basic traditional pub doesn't provide the level of comfort or sophistication that they desire, perhaps these people are snobs. Others find too much ponciness results in an "up their own arse" impression that doesn't belong in a pub, and perhaps this set of customers lack the appreciation required.

It wasn't something he always did, I seem to remember that at one point, he just started and the salsa was always great. I often helped with the chopping and lucky me, I learned how to make a great salsa.

A year ago at this time I was in BsAs, during a brief but refreshing stint with unemployment. I cashed out the meager pittance in my 401k, bought the cheapest ticket I could find and made my reservations for a month at a cozy family home in San Telmo. It wasn't my first visit but it was the first time I had gone on my own, a significantly different experience from the times I had gone with a group. I have no idea how a year has passed since then. When time passes by this quickly it becomes something almost terrifying. My memories are still so vivid, the people I spent time with so present to me. Some of the moments remaining on the periphery of my senses:
- Removable cargo pod
Boy: Yeah I could get in a lot of trouble. I shouldn't be doing this? (He is now WAY too close to me and I feel my personal space is being invaded!)
Do you like this colour? I don't think I need to repeat myself, but I was really surprised when I tried it. It's amazing! I'm already in the process of ordering a spare bottle of this beauty. I must admit that I'm beginning to like the Kaleidoscope holos far better than OMG holos.
I understand Pepperton has shut – what a shame!
It hurts, it hurts that I can't see him everytime, and I feel bad when I'm too around him, I feel like I'm annoying him. At the beggining I wasn't this attached, now I need him more and more.
christmas morning was spent with happy, giggling children and I still can't help but smile when I think about it. we always keep christmas low-key as far as presents are concerned.
The girls have been rowing together for a month now and this morning, after a tough session of time trials, they rowed in to an audience of proud parents.

Ok… so besides the terrible shock at seeing the huge picture of the lovely writer of the Sookie Stackhouse series… My day was absolutely wonderful. We grilled some yummy steaks and veggies for dinner, and now we are just relaxing and enjoying our evening!

The dough was divided into 8 pieces and rolled into a 24" coil. Shaping them was easy, thanks to Monica's great photos . I was in a rush, so I didn't have time to photograph the steps (click here, if you want to see Monica's). The fun part was dipping them into a pot of boiling water, with baking soda. That took 30 seconds, each. I brushed them with an egg wash and sprinkled kosher salt on them.

That same advice could also apply to Ambiga, a lawyer, but for politicians who desire regime change it is another matter.
As much as I adore this Peter Pan lace blouse, unfortunately I don't wear it out very often. I think the reason is that it's white and already lined with black cuffs and collar, so I feel like it can only look good with something at the bottom in black.
But really, I don’t even know how he feels about me. I don’t know why things would change when we were hanging out and moving forward and I wouldn’t think it’d change just because of the situation with his dad. But I do need reassurance and since I haven’t had it, I’m kind of preparing myself for this to just fade out in the same way it did with JJ, even though I really don’t want it to.

The room was dry crying. Just large terrified eyes looking desperately at each other for help, as if by showing such extreme fear the other could produce some kind of a miracle solution to stop the others anguish. Of course no-one could and mums drunken ranting and screaming was drifting in from outside.
Then, leave me a comment here and tell me which gift you'd like.
On a side note, Daisy really likes sun chips, who knew? She ate about half my bag! I told my mom if it isn't my child trying to eat my food, its my horse! Speaking of Chloe I decided to leave her with my awesome mother in law. I figured it was going to be a long day out in the sun and mom and I would be busy with Daisy, so I knew she would be happier at home. I missed the little booger though! I can't wait till she is older and more able to do things with me. I really would love to get her a tiny mini horse to ride around for her first few years of riding. I figure that thing can only hurt her so much, while a big horse has bigger hooves, bigger teeth and is just plain BIGGER, lol. If she takes a tumble off a mini its just that, a tumble. Not a fall! I figure we have another year before she will really want to be riding (maybe a little less) so maybe we can find her one by then.
The bull is the old testament symbol of Baal. 1st Kings 12:28 —- 19:18 Exodus 32. Baal the bull is symbolic of strength and fertility. God condemns the production and worship of idols. Yet many in the church do just that, worship idols. Exodus 23:13 ” And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.” Steeped in Egyptian, Grecian, and Roman fertility rites. Half of the parades celebrate and honor false gods. The rest promote sex and drunkenness.

I went to sort dome crap in the attic today, as Bob’s boarded the floor….OMG. I found some items I’d made at least 7 years ago…some from patterns, one self drafted. What’s galling is that I was better at inserting zips then……. o_O
They all had the same format, thin cardboard covered books with bright illustrations. The print varied in size - but not greatly. The illustrations were usually simple and realistic representations. I think, without looking, that the mother in "The taxi that hurried" is wearing a hat and gloves.

I don't remember how I found this book. It was one of those times I clicked on something that took me somewhere else that ultimately landed me on this book. And when I saw endorsements from two writers I admire (Mary DeMuth and Ann Voskamp) I investigated more closely. (Proving that endorsements do work!) I downloaded the free sample for the ebook and read through it so fast that, when I got to the end I just had to buy it and keep reading. (Proving that samples do work!) I am loving this book. It's hijacked my other reading-- books I liked getting pushed to the side for this book I am loving.
Once again, I relate this time in history in honor of Marti Kheel, who used her passion for justice and compassion to make the connections we all need to continue to make to create a better world for all living beings and our planet. We miss you and love you, Marti.

What makes her world-weary affectation so exasperating is that she has no reason to affect such pained despondency. Posh is one of the most fortunate women on the planet. She is rich and successful in her own right, with a handsome husband and four lovely, healthy children to come home to at night.
“Just see to it I have food and be on your way. The sooner I can start this, the better.” I speak in a vague tone quite intentionally. Of course I have no idea what I would do in the middle of nowhere, but I couldn’t afford to ignore this. It was the first time I had ever had a feeling like this.

Her response was, “What else do you want to do? Don’t get your license then.”
Morgan just jumped up still beyond teary-eyed and with more than a touch of the anger inherited either genetically or just now from her father shouted “I feel bad! I hate them! They’re mean and awful!” She ran around behind her father and clutched one of his legs.
And even though I didn't feel particularly guilty from sharing that cinnamon roll, I opted for a light brunch entree, an arugula/endive/radicchio salad with avocado, grapefruit, hazelnuts, goat cheese and roasted garlic vinaigrette with some grilled shrimp. And overall, a very enjoyable salad that maintained an incredible of balance of flavors and a fun mix of textures from all those components, and the garlic vinaigrette wasn't overpowering at all; in fact, there were only wisps and tinges of its pungency.
Mead means meadow here, not the rather scrummy alcoholic drink made from honey!
I silently thought to myself, "That sounds terrible! Oral cavity disease...surely this can't be right." Twenty minutes later the pain in my mouth took over my skepticism and I decided to give this medicine a shot. I applied a small bit on one of my canker sores to test it out and was more than a little surprised when the gel turned into a malleable wax that clung ever so tightly to gum. It was not what I expected. It was weird. But it worked. Here I am a couple days later, canker sore free. I still have no idea what exactly I was applying to the inside of my mouth 2x a day, but I'm still alive. I guess I should just trust the pharmacist when he so assuredly gives me something to take.

Career wise, things are going very well but my stress levels are increasing exponentially. This has affected my skin, which in turn has made me very anxious. We are also in the process of finding somewhere new to live as our lovely housemates are moving to Brighton. London is an expensive enough place without the shadow of the Olympics looming up on the horizon and driving up rental value to the point of insanity.
Yes, I did some cramming in order to prepare myself for Patience (After Sebald), picking up a copy of the particular Sebald book that Grant Gee, in his film, explores in great depth. Thankfully, though, The Rings of Saturn is stimulating enough that it never felt like mere "work." This is an amazing book: an intellectual/historical/personal travelogue that taps into a spirit of restless adventure that reminds me of why I consider Jack Kerouac's On the Road to be one of my favorite pieces of literature ever.
Today is day 9 of at least one person puking per day..... some days had more than one person puking....which has certainly been super fun.
I just got a film back last night, mere hours after finishing it, which always trips me out, so the next post will be all analog goodness.
The words echoed in my head for a few seconds. Then I knew I had to listen very carefully to everything he said because my daughter's health depended on it. The only things I could remember about Down syndrome were that it was an extra chromosome and it was forever.

As someone who has been married several times, I know how expensive it can be to buy a ring for someone when you're not really sure how long it's going to last. This ring is perfect for that special someone to whom you want to say "Yes, I do", without breaking the bank.
He went on to tell them again that yes, their fathers had ate the manna in the wilderness and they died. Nevertheless that this One, is the bread that descends from heaven so that whoever would eat of it would not then die and that anyone would eat this Bread that they would live forever. Also that the Bread which He would give on behalf of the life of the world was His flesh. Unless one would eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, they would not have life in them. Because of what He had said, the crowd went from grumbling to disputing what He had said because they could not bear to listen. This became an inseparable barrier for many of His followers and some turned back and no longer traveled with Him.
I love this skirt, even though it is a tad too big. I usually wear something over it, instead of tucked in. Versatile because of the mix of colors. Looks nice with red, grey and even tan.
Today, a killed polio vaccine is used in America because parents of vaccine injured children lobbied in the 1990’s to get the polio vaccine policy changed.
Do we really have to “girliefy” everything? You are running. Put on a damn pair of pants. If you want, make it pink, flower print, or cute little puppy dogs with hearts and flowers proclaiming how you ruff someone. I don’t care, but at least wear pants. I don’t need a skirt to show people that I’m a girl. That’s what the boobs are for. And speaking of boobs…
Opening the crisp whiteness, I read an acceptance. An invitation. An opportunity to sing. I've auditioned for the Charlotte Children's Choir, and now I can don the plaid skirt and matching vest...Sit with the sopranos and make music and friends and memories.

Repeat with your lining piece except on one side of your lining, you need to leave a 4 to 6 six inch hole. This will be VERY IMPORTANT later. You can see below where I place a horizontal pin to remind myself not to sew in between the two pins.
Maybe you'll make some homemade gifts this year--maybe you won't. But if making everything "just right" comes at the price of missing time with family or even worse--becoming Grinchy toward your loved ones, then it's time to throw in the towel. I'm totally preaching to myself here. I wish I could say I'm just a pleasure to be around all of the time, but that's not the truth. Especially today.
Empty structures, façades shattered by bullets and shells, and no human presence: far from the pathos and spectacle of war, this series in black-and-white simply records effects and, by linking war ruins to ancient vestiges, makes the ravaged city seem timeless. In 1984 a book of these photographs, with a text by Lucretius from De Rerum Natura, was published by Hazan in Paris and Thames & Hudson in London, provoking strong reactions. This would be the case with several of her emblematic series, in which the medium does not evacuate but mediates the lived reality.

British-based terrorists have carried out operations in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kenya, Tanzania, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Israel, Morocco, Russia, Spain, and America. Many governments such as Jordanian, Egyptian, Moroccan, Spanish, French, and American have protested against our elites allowing the Islamist terrorist infrastructure in this country and refusing to extradite wanted operatives.
This is another card I created for my Card Class ladies to make. They got to make 2 of this design.

He also explained that one of his Amish friends, who had been English for a period of his life, said to him, "I don't know how you handle those English women, they're too smart for me." It made me chuffed to know that an Amish man thought so highly of me and my English sisters, but it also made me think that the Amish women are probably too smart to let on how smart they are.
In 1992, the evidence — a rape kit — was tested and the results confirmed the Topeka man serving a prison term for the rape was innocent. That test led to Joe Jones’ freedom.
“Why can I believe you?” I asked him, taking a sip from a glass of water, thankfully placed by my side.
If you scroll down to the end of the 2012 Most Anticipated Books post Emma and I did you see that About that night is my most anticipated book of 2012. I have been pinning and waiting and dreaming about it for MONTHS and now, in just a a few days I will finally be able to read it! YAAAY! I strongly suggest you give Julie James's books a chance, she IS a contemporary romance superstar!! Her books have it all, loveable characters, great intriguing plots, humor and wit and romance you wished you had. If you like contemporary books and haven't read anything by Julie James, I suggest you hit your Barnes & Noble now and for my YA lovers who want to dip their toes in adult books, Julie James is a great author who will hook you to the genre!
Occasionally I have found myself in an argument with somebody in a workshop – that is soooo not helpful. By getting into an argument it can often reinforce people’s attitudes or opinions, because they are presenting them forcefully. It would be much more helpful to ask questions, particularly ones that encourage them to reflect on exceptions to their attitudes. (Fran Peavey has some interesting material on strategic questioning.)

One of the most important planning issues confronting a business owner is what happens to his or her shares of the business upon death. Insurance-funded business transfer plans can guarantee the shares will be legally transferred to the right successors at the right price. The primary questions revolve around what type of buy-sell agreement and what life insurance owner and beneficiary designations will accomplish this business transfer plan most efficiently.

I was at home the other day, reading, big surprise there, and my girls asked me if we could go to the book store to buy some new books for them because they just didn’t have any new material to read. Well, I am a single mom with a single income and I thought how in the world will I come up with some extra cash to support what I think is a really awesome habit to form at their ages. I still love it when people approach me and remark upon the excellent example I am providing for my kids by reading in front of them. Frankly a world without books would be a sad world indeed. But I digress…It dawned on me, why not take them down to the local library and get them each their own library cards? Such a simple thing really. I beg, cheat and steal books from all my friends to cut the costs of my reading addiction, so why not take it a step further? So we went down to the library, signed up and voila…books! It was so cool. Yes, I took advantage too. I even found out that they have a waiting list for books and you can even make reservations over the computer and the library will notify you as soon as they are available to be picked up.
Blue is a colour, the perception of which is evoked by light having a spectrum dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 450–490 nm. It is considered one of the additive primary colours. On the HSV Colour Wheel, the complement of blue is yellow; that is, a colour corresponding to an equal mixture of red and green light. On a colour wheel based on traditional colour theory (RYB) where blue was considered a primary colour, its complementary colour is considered to be orange (based on the Munsell colour wheel).
My grandmother in September apparently confused me with my sister (who could live on Brie and red pepper jelly) and brought me a big pot of homemade red pepper jelly which has been gathering dust at the back of my shelves for the last 8 months, just waiting for this moment.

This is my favourite season. I love the rains ... even when it blows all those lovely blooms off the trees. And even when it rains non-stop for days on end and everything is a big squelchy mess. Actually 'rain' is such a bland word for the sheer drama that our monsoons bring... I just can't wait for the show to start.
Several people have asked me to paint something for them. I can't bring myself to do it. Mainly for the lack of time but also because it scares me. It's one thing to mess up something that belongs to me but an entirely different story to mess up a piece of furniture that belongs to someone else. I DID paint a dresser for my niece's nursery last year that turned out cute. But I thought I was going to have to go buy her a new dresser before it reached "cuteness"!

Pictures are better as I mentioned. I made a custom made blog design. Ummm.... Apart from that it's growing slowly, because I can't put enough time into it. I'm still learning as I'm going, and am not expecting it to grow that much sicne I know I would have to put so much more time into it for it to grow more/ more quickly. But I'm still quite happy with it. Sometimes I wish I had waited a bit because I know I'm making so many mistakes and I started not really knowing a lot about crafting, this blog was to help me with that, but at the same time I'm ok with that, with my blog growing slowly as I improve.
Yesterday customers received an email from Netflix, and in one fell swoop this much loved company, one that was a darling of its customers, had put that strong equity on the line. It is ironic that they were thanking customers for their business, in this email, even as they were clearly holding a gun to their heads with another price hike.
I love how everyone puts their own slant on their work - from fabric covered, fussy cut buttons to adding ribbon, frills and binding - great job ladies - excellent work :)
It involved a strap we have that looks very much like this and is made by the same company. In my memory, I don't believe my husband has ever used it on me. It is sitting on that awful implement filled shelf in his nightstand.
Brooks doesn’t look good at all. His eyelids are very red and there is red under them. There is a rash all over his body that is most likely strep or staph. This all started with a simple diaper rash he couldn’t fight off because of his weakened immune system.

Just a quick note to let you know that I'm going to be away for a few more days, as we're halfway through an unexpected, last minute vacation to one of my favorite places, Salt Spring Island. It's been three years since we've had a proper holiday, so we're reveling in the R&R, taking the occasional break to eat, read, and cool off with a swim.

However, after they had opened the dolls, they each opened their little package of mini angry birds and they were ECSTATIC. So excited and happy. i got all kinds of hugs and sweetness. i'm pretty sure i could have scratched the dolls all together and they would have been completely thrilled by those little birds that took less than 20 min. to make! Cutest, silliest little kids ever. :) LOVE them.

I really didn't think these bars would be THAT good. Chocolate chip bars, yummy but not my favorite (you know as in chocolate chip cookies are not my favorite kind of cookie either).
When the COP talks about country first politics, which country are they referring too? Is is some imaginary space that I don’t know about? Their entire approach to politics from day one has been just as selfish and abusive of the country, as the UNC’s has been abusive of them. They have bowed, scraped and fought to remain in the powers of corridor not to help the country but to be able to help themselves. This party has had numerous opportunities to retain its integrity and actually serve the interests of the people that voted it in to power. It’s 22 months and 8 days of governance by this PP government and the first time the COP took a firm stance on an issue was when the party felt it was going to lose the Mayorship of San Fernando….and when you understand how local government projects run and the kind of money it can generate, you will realise that is not the political position they vex about so much as the economic and political largesse that they stand to lose once this mayorship is out of their hands…in short funding and contracts folks…yes…it boils down to $$$$$ and cents!
The movement has also displayed a deft hand at the sort of binary thaumaturgy we discussed last week. Over the last few months, it has capably promoted a narrative in which it claims to speak for 99% of Americans while assigning its opponents the remainder. This is a difficult trick for what is, after all, a tiny protest movement supported by a minority of Americans, but I can’t think of an example since Lenin redefined his little revolutionary faction as “the Majority”—that’s what bolshevik means in Russian—where it has been carried off with such aplomb.

Bottom line: Mélusine is one of those novels that lives and dies on the strength of its characters—if you don’t like Felix and Mildmay, you’re not going to like the book. The French Revolution-inspired setting is much appreciated, however. If you’d like.
So it has nothing to do with the pistol being a Glock, or a .40. Though, I'll grant this may happen easier with the Glock design, given it has a very small and pointy ejector tip that is slightly closer to the firing pin than in some other designs; that doesn't make this a design flaw or safety problem for Glocks.

This coat is one of the things I managed to snag in the boxing day sales, it's from River Island which is somewhere I never used to shop but recently I've been going in there more and more. I haven't had a proper winter coat in ages and ages so I wasn't sure about getting this in case it was a bit too granny/schoolchild in ww2 but it's really warm and fuzzy so I couldn't really say no.
No matter how rewarding or noble it is to be of service to others - whether you're a coach, in retail, or taking care of an ailing parent - you cannot leave your self-care out of the picture. If you do, you'll soon burn-out, become ill or angry, and you'll ultimately be serving no one.

I have decided henceforth that my birthday will be the end of May each year. The end of January does not bode well with me. We always have very cold weather and extra expenses (mainly car) and it is too soon after Christmas. So now it will be the end of May, a better time for a party, maybe a barbeque with friends.
While other minor characters come into play, Rusty and Honor are the focus of the book. The banter between them is hilarious and fun, giving plenty of light moments to the book despite the darkness over their situation. Even with this, however, Kirby triggers the memories of Finn, or the sorrow over his death at all the right moments, giving a very realistic and raw air to the book. With some great unexpected antics along the way, the road trip feel is strong and unforgettable, without being the primary focus of the book.
I did not mean too but I got ahead of her by 15 feet. I should have known not to leave her alone and I guess she forgot we were in a five story open air rotunda.

Thankfully a friend with a key came to the rescue and let my mother out of the house. Had there not been friends with keys in my life, I’m not sure my mother would have visited as often as she did.
When I worked in downtown Seattle in the 1980s, the library occupied a squat black glass building that did nothing to inspire reading or writing, at least on the outside. The new library, built in 2004, is so wildly creative that it’s been both a prize-winner and a bit of a controversy. The exterior makes you wonder "what building is that?"
"On ne possede qu'en s'abstenant," ("We only possess by abstaining") Colette said. In this season of buying, when the notion of abstinence is forced from our minds by the media, we might do worse than to let a few things go, to possess them all the better.

Following the 2011 competition a survey found that 96% of teachers believed it was an excellent tool for teaching literacy and writing skills. Steven Moffat, Doctor Who's lead writer and executive producer, reflected, 'I come from a family of teachers, I was a teacher, my father's a teacher, my sister's a teacher. We go back teacher generations so it's hard wired for me to want the approval of teachers so I'm very, very thrilled that its gone down so well with the schools that took part.'
Lord (Alan) Sugar, entrepreneur and host of the TV show The Apprentice, spoke for many when he said recently that UK maternity laws meant people ‘were entitled to have too much; everything has gone too far’.
Writers sometimes have to perform a tricky balancing act. They have to serve up a story that can provide the pleasure readers are anticipating, while also offering something new, something surprising and unique.
And so here we are, in the year 2012, as polarized as ever, with both political parties saying – “you know I am right”, which, incidentally, is a great and little known song by Pink Floyd guitarist, David Gilmour. Get yourselves some free Spotify and have a listen: You Know I’m Right.

this is why I was up until one. Because I realized the overwhelming task I have set myself on with my lack of organizing. The hole is deep. But I really want to tackle it. Not all at once, mind you. But I want to be organized by the time the baby arrives. I don't think I'll ever get to the color coordinated calendar of events organized, but I want to get to the a place for everything, everything in its place (or something like that) organized. I at least want to know where my notebooks are at all times in case inspiration strikes.
Fair share, investing in education, grow, fair shot, follow rules, responsibility, middle class, transform our economy. (Applause.)
This leads me to the final point I want to discuss today — the rigorous standards and process of review to which we hold ourselves today when considering and authorizing strikes against a specific member of al-Qa’ida outside the “hot” battlefield of Afghanistan.

This is the beautiful new design from Julie at Knitted Bliss. - Wildflower Tank. And it's featured in the Spring Issue of IK. I'd been looking at some summer tanks to knit soon and when I saw this on Julie's blog, I knew it would be my next garment project! I couldn't get 100% silk at the LYS, so I've picked something else. I'll be swatching this weekend and will let you know if it will work and show you when I cast on.
The Gene Expression blog has been an invaluable ally of human biodiversity research. The writers are highly intelligent freethinkers. The fact that some of them have some liberal-leaning views and were early supporters of Howard Dean is no more an incongruity with their race realism than is the Christian faith of Steve Sailer and Charles Murray. It would only help this line of research to make it a little more acceptable in polite (that is, liberal) company. On the other hand, I am noticing eroding anonymity for certain writers, which could be a problem for them because liberal academia, I believe, is their home. (Full disclosure: nooffensebut is not my real name.)
On another note, I will also have to knit a chilly toy - it only seems right to mix the two hobbies at some point!

We truly loved her.
We're not fooling. They may not like us, but we are a force to be reckoned with.
More recently though I discovered that some expats can be a bit brutal in their networking for friendships. I came to realise that someone who I thought was a good friend was actually not that interested in being 'my' friend but just wanted to use me in order to meet my other friends. Another friend told me this is not uncommon, and she has often found that newcomers attempt to make friends through her, though they may not be interested in her as a friend. She seemed to take this as just par for the course, but it all seems a bit callous to me. She suggested to me that my bad experience might have come about because the person knew that I was due to leave Berlin at the end of May. She says that she knows a few expats whose first question on meeting new people is "How long are you here for?", and if it doesn't meet some acceptable length of time in their head, then they don't bother any further with that person. I kind of get it, but I can't help but think that they might be missing out on meeting some potential good friends, and having some good times. Or maybe, just maybe, the other person has just had a lucky escape.
When I cam home to find the spider invasion I really wanted to just throw all the plants and dirt out and quit the whole apartment garden. I felt disgusted and violated in some ways. The grade motivated me to find a solution that didn’t involve wasting my plants, and quitting my personal sustainability promise. I’m kind of glad I had something like this happen now, because I would have never tried putting my plants outside and I feel like they will truly do better now. I really want to succeed at growing my own food. I don’t want to fail because I know that when I eat a tomato that I grew myself it will taste better than any tomato I picked up from the store (I’m hoping the taste of the hairspray doesn’t come out in the flavor). I’m just a few days/weeks away from harvesting. I’m getting really anxious.

“It’s propaganda, Tori. You can’t throw your life away for a pamphlet.”
In fact, the concept "cause and effect" derives, psychologically speaking, only from a mode of thought that believes that always and everywhere will operates upon will--that believes only in living things and fundamentally only in "souls" (and not in things). Within the mechanistic view of the world (which is logic and its application to space and time), that concept is reduced to the formulas of mathematics--with which, as one must emphasize again and again, nothing is ever comprehended, but rather designated and distorted.
Most often, spiritual gifts are revealed not through a diagnostic test but through the experience of serving the Lord. The sooner we begin serving where there is a need, the sooner we will begin to learn where the Lord is leading us in our service to Him.

Bobby Bland got first strike with this song, but never did he do it like the Grateful Dead who got second strike in 1966. And certainly not what turned out to be the jam of a historical proportion with members of The Allman Brothers Band & Fleetwood Mack joining them on stage.
Sometimes I get into a bit of a pickle and this is what’s happening at the moment. Of late my sleep has been broken and my mood lower. I was feeling very well and decreased my medication – this was a perfectly natural thing to do. Unfortunately as a result of this decrease in medication, I have experienced a lower mood and an increase in anxiety. To help me deal with this low mood and anxiety I have restored my medication to its full dose and increased my daily mindfulness practice. Living with the memories that I do have is difficult but not impossible. To help me cope I have taken short cuts – it is easier to think and talk in terms of worms rather than face, acknowledge and accept the full reality of the abuse.

At any rate, this is a little late for Halloween--but today's post is about zombie literary agencies...agencies that die only to rise again and lurch out onto the Internet in search of writers' brains. More specifically, it's about one zombie agency, which is attempting to eat brains under two zombie identities.

I have a friend called Karen, who makes amazing crystal jewellery and when she holds online markets on her facebook business page, pieces get sold very quickly. We all love her work, but only one person can end up being the owner of a piece. The rest of us, while disappointed, congratulate the person who said sold first and then keep an eye out for other pieces. We can do this because we understand that if it were meant to be ours, we would have been able to get there quicker.
Jack McDevitt’s Alex Benedict novels give me all of these things in a slick package. Alex isn’t the most highly regarded guy around: an antique dealer accused of damaging historical sites, he’s nevertheless very good at his profession. McDevitt made a good turn when he switched the point of view in the books from Alex to his partner Chase. She’s a more dynamic character and being out of the loop of Alex’s brilliant insights, is more relatable for the reader.

However, it can be argued that it is increasingly dangerous for the U.S. to project her ideals into international affairs with what has come to be perceived by many as hypocritical inconsistency. Similarly, it may be unwise to do so at a time when real global power is cycling away from sole American dominance, an issue to be discussed later in this paper. Instead, America will therefore need powerful and reliable allies such as China and Russia in her confrontation with the fundamentalist forces that threaten all of modern civilization.
Of importance is there is a very good working relationship between the business owner and the team of mentors. As mentors, we are convinced that the business owner and his manufacturing firm will be an operational and financial success. Central to that conviction is the business owner’s attitude and resiliency. The fact that the mentors are volunteers and have no financial stake in the business is an important part of the relationship. Stay tuned, there will be much positive news about this company!
Oh my goodness! She has come so far since the NICU where they told us she would be mentally retarded. She just keeps amazing us. She is such a strong little girl.
Another theme An Na dealt with, albeit with less (imo) success, is her duality on what others want versus what the self wants. In this story, Mina, who has always lived for others, is starting to confront the things she wants for herself. Usually when this kind of theme pops up we are often told that what the Self wants is far more important than the considerations of others, and it’s all very tidy and clean and simply portrayed. This is not a motif I personally buy, because this kind of motif does not acknowledge the points of the other side, how sometimes in doing things for others you feel happy 1) for making another person happy and 2) for being happy that you could give happiness to others. (ex. Don’t you feel happy when you think of the perfect gift for a person you care about, and then find out that your friend loved your gift? Doing things for others is not as insufferable or oppressive or harmful as “Western” fictional mediums like to depict it to be.) I do not believe that An Na intended for this to be the usual Self triumphing over Other’s Desires thing I’m used to seeing in these Asian-American stories, if the Suna ending is anything to go by, but I thought An Na’s development of this theme was inadequate and left her conclusion missing the impact it needed. In Mina’s case, the line between doing things for others for love and doing things for others is bringing the Self suffering is crossed, and this struggle to re-negotiate these boundaries are tentatively put up into play. The problem with the depiction of this theme was that one side was too strong over the other; the mother’s desires are almost caricatures of oppressive harm, and on the other side, Mina’s love for Suna was unconvincing. They’re too didactic, and it makes this theme come across as inadequate.

I was fully in a sea of multiple orgasms, tethered to the source of the pleasure, her wanton pussy by my cock. As I was tempest tossed in the recurring crescendos of sweet anguish my mind went back into the haze of euphoria. I lay there and surrendered to the tsunami of seething hot erotic sensation that was rising around me and inside of me. I was immobilized by the rising and falling tide of orgasmic pleasure and I became one with that pleasure.

Upon completing a level you are taken to a resting zone where you can save and talk to other sheep in the nightmare. Some sheep have distinguishing features and you may be able to share climbing techniques helping each other survive the nightmare. Before starting the next stage of the night you are asked a question in a confessional. These are questions about relationships and it will affect a meter similar to moral choice systems. These questions can affect the ending of the game and you are able to see how other players, divided by male and female, answered the same question on their first playthrough of the game.

I've become more of a fan of all things red over the past few years so I love the red pieces above. I also couldn't help but note the very Chuck Bass-like influences in some of the male styling. The one below is definitely Chuck worthy. Yep, I still watch Gossip Girl even if the series seems to be crumbling around the edges and has kind of lost it's sparkle, any thoughts? All in all, it was a pretty fun day and I did leave wanting to go shopping and inspired to stock up on a few Autumn/Winter essentials (hello Velvet and statement jewellery!).

Dead seems to be defining some interesting new (or new-ish) territory outside of this rather routine horror storytelling. And this is quite apart from having characters who are adaptable, bright, quick to realise what's going on in the situation and I really have to reiterate my earlier point that I would like to kiss the actors and screenwriters all 'round for not making me live through an unending stream of 'But it can't be happening!' speeches 'cause I can't tell you how sick I am of that. My girlfriend can tell you of the long lectures I deliver to characters in horror movies instructing them to either snap to the truth of things and get a gun in hand or line up to be a hot dinner for whatever evil is on the rampage.
A selection I loved was the capture of Oregon running back LaMichael James in the second round. Not much was said about this kid going into the draft process, even though he had a massive year in college. The signing of James now means the 49ers can call upon either Gore, Bradshaw or LaMichael to improve that offense that struggled a little bit in 2011/12.

Parchment paper packets are a snap to cook with. Cut off an 18-20 inch piece of parchment and place your food in the center. Leave at least 4 inches on the sides. Now, grab the long ends of the paper and have them meet in the air in the middle, then just fold them down until you get to the food. You’ll end up with a long package. Now all you have to do is simply twist each end. (You can see illustrations at: http://nopotcooking.com/index.php/technique/). Place the packets on a baking sheet or toaster oven tray for easy in moving them around.

If you keep the label, use it. Use it to question yourself and your assumptions. Use it to help you give your kids the benefit of the doubt, always. Use it to help you say Yes more. Use it as pressure to tolerate the discomfort that comes from having your kids make choices that you wouldn't have made for them. Use it to encourage you to choose the kind, generous, cooperative thing in every interaction. And use it to inspire you to go after more of the benefits that real unschooling offers.
Vocalist Evan Seinfeld recently retired from Brooklyn’s Biohazard, a band he formed in his teenage years. “After 10 albums and probably around 4000 concerts with Biohazard across 90 countries spanning 25 years, all I can say is that the only thing constant in life is change, and without it, things can become stagnant and repetitious. The creative situation for me playing with Rusty and Tony in ATTIKA 7 fosters my genuine creativity to flow, and allowed us to build something heavy, authentic, new and exciting from the ground up. ATTIKA 7 is something I am beyond passionate about and so excited - Blood of My Enemies is THE album in my opinion.”
In that way, I am an example of being good enough for God. Be connected to Christ. Hear his Word and believe it. Think on your Baptism with faith in the new life and forgiveness God has given you in that water. Receive the Lord’s Supper believing that all the blessings of Christ’s life, death, and resurrection are given to you in his body and blood with that bread and wine. Being good enough for God is not about what you do or anything you could offer. Being good enough for God is all about what God has done for you in Christ.

I've been giving you tips on how to save up on fashion and beauty, but there are so much more I haven't shared! One of those things I would love to tell you about is books! I love books! Ever since I was a little girl, I would always have one in my hands. My folks would always catch me reading just about anything, from pamphlets they give out at the grocery store, to grocery lists, to magazines, and yes, to books! I was blessed to have parents who supported my vice for literature at such an early age. I would read my fairy tales at night religiously. I was very eager to take down notes in class and read them again at home. While other kids preferred hitting the dirt and playing as soon as they get home, I would curl up inside my room with a new read. My folks bought lots of books - almanacs, encyclopedias, dictionaries, etc. And I would look forward to reading all of them! That love for literature is something that I carried on to my adulthood. I can skimp out on fancy clothes and shoes but books are definitely on top of my list. Whenever I go to the mall, I cannot NOT visit the bookstore and browse through racks and racks of books. Even if I'm not going to buy one, just seeing them makes me happy. Of course I'd be happier if I get to take home at least one!

Running without a purpose is what I'm pretty much doing right now. I find it odd that I feel that way, but I've been training for a race since December of last year (until the half a few weeks ago), so it feels like my running has no purpose. When I sit and think about that, it almost sounds depressing, but I actually look at it as a challenge. I've used races and schedules to keep me focused on my workouts for well over a year now. It's time to use myself to stay focused. I think it's going to be an interesting journey...

It has never been important to me to follow social conventions. I don’t need to answer the phone by saying hello. I don’t need to say goodbye to people when leaving a party. If you’ve told me a story, I’ll let you know. If my eyes are better used elsewhere, I won’t give you constant eye contact. And I don’t feel bad about any of these things, but I do think I’ve gotten progressively worse over time. And while my social incongruities may have been quirky before, they may well be just annoying now.

Upholding the Arizona laws would be just a small fix of a part of a huge problem, but they’re a step in the right direction down the healing path.

Skytrax Airline quality review has awarded this airline with 4 stars rating for cabin crew safety procedures. The airlines has set its standard high and tries hard to replicate every facet of the airline tickets student discount in order to arm the cheap airline tickets student in case of emergency, or to the airline tickets student discount with my overnight pack. The airport hotel at Kuala Lumpur is excellent and is actually attached to the airline tickets student discount and co-pilot are responsible for the airline tickets student discount new Boeing aircrafts are Boeing 737-800 with 189 seats and Boeing 737-900ER with 212 seats. The aircrafts provides you a lot of luggage should you buy?

“The officers saluted as she passed and gravely bowed. They walked back across the courtyard and got into their chairs. She saw Waddington light a cigarette. A little smoke lost in the air, that was the life of a man.”
It makes me sad to even think there is a possibility that this nation could become as ignorant as to put one of these “leaders” who propose to harm the poor into oblivion in power just because they are the candidates of the political party they traditionally vote for or to satisfy their prejudice.

The top issuers of mortgage securities without government backing in 2005 included Bank of America’s Countrywide Financial unit, GMAC, Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual, according to trade publication Inside MBS & ABS. Total volume for the top 10 issuers was $672 billion. JPMorgan acquired Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual in 2008.

FOR the unit, we have developed a graphic organizer to help students think about the different discoveries that their character makes during the course of the story. I loaded these into neu.annotate PDF for my students to access through the iPads. This is an app we used several months ago, so I was a bit concerned that we would all be rusty. I was impressed with how quickly it all came back to them (and to me, for that matter!)

His writings explain the prayer journey, usually by way of analogy – after all, there are no human words to describe the divine. He wrote about the detachments and purifications needed to begin and continue the ascent up the mountain of prayer, the dark night of the soul, and the joy and fulfillment expressed in the spiritual canticle and the living flame of God’s love. In contemporary terms, these four works by St. John of the Cross talk about “letting go and letting God.” They describe the growing relationship between a human being and God, all occurring within the soul. “Know you not that you are God’s temple and that His Spirit dwells within you.”
The extreme cases will doubtless be like Santorum who will choose and pick their friends by whether or not they use porn (will check and un-friend SIMPLY for watching pron no less . . . ), and further discriminate against porn users by preventing people from viewing or buying ‘porny’ things they like – none of anyone’s business what anyone else does in private or in premises or districts for these purposes with like minded individuals, how can such a law be passed in a democracy?

I've just started the first round of edited revision on SPIES. As much a I can't wait to be on the other side of this revision with a finished manuscript in hand, revision is my favorite part of the writing process. The first draft hurts because it's both overwhelming and unknown. But revision, revision is where a manuscript becomes a book, where characters become real, where plots have a purpose and where stories come to life.

Something you've probably already heard about Sweet Evil is the steamy romance that happens between Anna and Kai. Considering Kai's father is the demon of lust and Anna's is the demon of substance abuse you can only imagine how steamy this romance gets. Kai will definitely sneak his way into your heart, he's the total package, British, hot beyond you wildest imagination, dark and mysterious with a sweet side, and lastly he's the drummer in a rock band. *swoons* Basically he's a total bad boy.

I've learned by now that life-changing things don't happen all at once, but it's especially noticeable this time. Last week I was scheduling appointments for myself and my future. And this week I'm back to scheduling appointments for my bosses. Pair that up with the natural come-down from a good vacation, and it has a bit of a whiplash effect!
It sets out in remarkable clarity what is wrong with the EUnion, and why it will lead to the exact opposite of what the EUnion clais it is for. The closing is particularly strong, arguing that those of us who loath the EUnion at least share the vision of a prosperous and peaceful continent. Where we and the EUrocrats part ways is in our vehement opposition to the means employed by the EUrocrats. It is not whether we want peace and prosperity. It is how we will achieve it.

White: This is really the blending of all colors in the light spectrum and is the presence of strong light. Because of its strength, white can cause the eye to shut down or to be over-used. As a result, overexposure to white can cause headaches and can even be blinding. One’s energy is dissipated fastest in a white room. White is also associated with purity, innocence, cleanliness, and goodness. People who prefer white are often seen as neat, fussy, apathetic, shy, athletic, and superficial.

I also wanted to do a full mile on the treadmill in the 20 minutes, as my prior day was not quite there, so I upped the speed and did it! (pats self on the back).

Shops, moreover, generally succeed best when in groups of a sufficient number to form what is known among the shopkeepers as a ‘ market ‘ ; odd shops scattered about are not liked. Sometimes it would be best not to attempt anything in the way of a centre beyond a portion of wide roadway, which might contain shops and a few public buildings, on the lines of the main village street with which every one is familiar. In other cases it may be possible, while keeping the shops on the main streets, to develop opposite them a green or square around which some of the other buildings may be grouped ; but whatever be the form, there can be no doubt of the importance, even on small sites, of having some central feature up to which the design may lead.

This is a duo that mixes fuzzed out black metal and doom together. Musically the band keep it in the slow to mid-paced doom range. The band does have some faster black metal guitar moments but they are few and far between. The vocals use a lot of effects, which I am not a fan of, trying to create a darker, demonic effect on their voice (I assume) but doesn't really work for this band. In fact I think it hurts, as the music is OK but the vocals totally ruined this release for me. I do respect the band for trying to be creative or whatever but it failed pretty miserably on 'Stab Me'. Hopefully they will try a different approach on the next
An early example of the state oppressing its own people and privileging foreigners was the judgements on the race battle in Notting Hill of 1958. Evil Judge Salmon gave excessive sentences of around 4 years to the young working-class lads but excused the Blacks.

Each of the arguments against the advantage of ‘not dying’ is teleological, which is to say goal-oriented. . . . Something that is teleological is thus directed toward a definite end or has an ultimate purpose. It requires natural selection to be godlike, to be able to predict the future. Natural selection is supposed to be a simple matter of random mutations. Most of those mutations are harmful to the organism, but in rare cases an advantageous mutation occurs, say, a curved beak that allows a bird to dip into a flower for nectar or a flatter tail that provides a beaver with speed and mobility. Those mutations are selected for, goes Darwin’s respected theory, and become commonplace in a species, helping it to survive. A curved beak might one day become a disability, but natural selection has no way of knowing this. Natural selection is like a desperate corporate CEO, worrying about third-quarter profits only and not thinking about ruination down the road (29–30).

All heat and no cold made Christmas especially problematic. How would Santa ever be able to come visit us? Sleighs don’t lend themselves well to travel on the high-speed Florida Turnpike. Reindeer will end up run off the road and flailing in the canals, a tasty holiday treat for the alligators. Santa’s going to get a god-awful chafe wearing that wool suit in our heat. How will his swollen legs fit in our chimney, even if we had a chimney or knew what one was? My parents reassured us that he’d make a special trip to south Florida in a helicopter and that he’d wear seersucker golf pants for his trip down through our air conditioning ducts and into our living room. Not quite the picture painted in TV’s Christmas specials.
People always ask me about the places I’ve been…what my favorite country was…what the most beautiful thing I’ve seen is…where was the best food…who had the nicest people??? I’ve been to a lot of countries and seen a lot of things, but I’m not naive enough to think I’ve seen it all, there is so much more out there that I haven’t even come close to experiencing. But I certainly can share my experiences to date, let you know what I thought, how I felt and if I would ever go back. I don’t doubt your experience might be different than my own, it is what you make it and want it to be. That is the beauty of traveling, people can all go to the same place and have a different experience than the next person. So let the pictures do a lot of the talking, and see what you want to see. I hope you enjoy looking at this as much as I enjoy reliving it.

instead of tossing these too soft bananas in the freezer, i sought out a more immediately noble end for them. i usually make my mom’s banana loaf, which is dark and lovely and predictable, but i thought this would be the perfect occasion to dig into my newly acquired dorie greenspan cookbook: baking, from my home to yours. out of her great selection of tasty sounding banana treats, i selected her ‘classic banana bundt cake’ as i wanted something that would taste even better the next day (my strategy here is that my colleagues will eat more of it than i do). despite the fact that i’m saving it for work, i couldn’t help but try a piece as it was cooling – the sweet baked-banana aroma was too much to resist. and, since i couldn’t wait until tomorrow to taste it, i certainly won’t wait until tomorrow to tell you how good it is (already) – the initial flavour is full-on banana with a side of vanilla. yum.

November 14, 2009 marked the 1-year anniversary of Grandma going on to heaven. I still can't believe she is gone. Grandpa started going downhill a little faster after she passed away. But, long story short, shortly after his 92nd birthday (October 13), he accepted Christ (I will blog more about that later). He passed away December 29th. His funeral was very good though; I do hope it brought glory to God. Several of the cousins got involved in the service; all 10 of the grandkids were there, the first time we'd all been together in over a year, and we sang a couple hymns. I played taps at the graveside service. It was all very nice. My cousin's husband Brandon did a very nice job of preaching the service! We all miss him very much, but know he is in a much better place! And we will all see him again one day!

I've heard people talk about the whole "Right brain VS. Left brain" theory and decided to take the test to see which one I was. Not surprisingly I am more "right brained" than "left brained." According to the online test this means, "The right side of your brain controls the left side of your body. In addition to being known as right-brained, you are also known as a creative thinker who uses feeling and intuition to gather information. You retain this information through the use of images and patterns. You are able to visualize the "whole" picture first, and then work backwards to put the pieces together to create the "whole" picture. Your thought process can appear quite illogical and meandering. The problem-solving techniques that you use involve free association, which is often very innovative and creative. The routes taken to arrive at your conclusions are completely opposite to what a left-brained person would be accustomed. You probably find it easy to express yourself using art, dance, or music. Some occupations usually held by a right-brained person are forest ranger, athlete, beautician, actor/actress, craftsman, and artist. "
Efforts in the 1990's to tear down these pillars of failed public policy, and give the former residents vouchers to move into private rental housing birthed fears that these refugees would bring the projects' ill repute into their new communities. These fears, founded on a mix of contradictory liberal NIMBY-dom, decades of de-facto segregation, and a sprinkle of racism seem for the most part to have proven false in at least two major cities.

Even more than what this indicated about his own healing process, I was emotionally overtain by the moment as a political act. As for his own healing process, the film-maker saves the best for last. In a meta-statement that would make the director of Sherlock Jr. proud, we are shown the dolls of the dolls. We see Hogancamp manipulating the now big doll of himself, manipulating the new little doll of himself, being filmed in a documentary about the referent of the referent that is the actual man. You'd think that artifice upon artifice would constitute a further retreat from reality. But dialectically, the exact opposite is happening. Not as some ironic twist either. By allowing his emerging post-trauma experience into his pretend kingdom, the man is reconstituting his self-consciousness, reclaiming the dignity of his whole mind, recovering his soul. This is incontrovertibly confirmed we we see him bringing in to the picture his post-post-trauma experience.

My blogs on “Tell Me What You Really Think” are purely opinion. This article was presented in Forbes Magazine- a business periodical none-the-less. So, is the author telling me, that he really by name, compared members of the 5th Congress, the congress that passed the bill known as “An Act for the Relief of Sick and Disabled Seamen” to the Continental Congress that created the “Declaration of Independence”? And why didn’t cite the “Rift” between Jefferson and Adams? Buyer beware.

I do not believe women are inferior to men. I do believe that culture will always play an important role in how we see each sex’s role and identity in society. I believe men and women were created as equals, but each has his and her place. I believe in accepting our roles and living our lives in these God-given roles. Maybe the fact that one sex has more authority than the other should not be a source of oppression if the role is taken up in the way it should be. Those are my thoughts on the whole ordeal.

Most religious institutions struggle with keeping teenagers engaged. After formal religious school ends, parents ease up on attendance, and it can be tough to compete for time with the AP classes, the high school sports programs, the college searches. But in our family, our kids know better than to take our interfaith community for granted. They know that many interfaith kids do not have such a community nearby. And they know that both of their parents have dedicated a lot of time and thought to building and maintaining this community for them.

I've been working so hard on big paintings recently, preparing for an exhibition next month, that I have had very little time for the computer, or anything else! However, there are a dozen more paintings trying to escape from my head, and countless playful ideas that I want to experiment with. So, as a break from the larger, detailed work, and by way of a 'Thank you' to all of you who take the time to read what I write, and are kind enough not to take it personally if I don't always have time to reply to comments (though I read them all, and DO try to answer them all), I thought it was time to offer up a little original.
Ask the parent of an abused child what they’d do differently if they could turn back time. They’d teach their child their rights, they’d teach their child what it is wrong for another to do to them. And they’d teach them to come back and tell them about it.
Veronique Chevalier on ReverbNation:
Bribery makes life SO much simpler. They are happy, you are happy, life is good. Somewhere down the road, I may come to regret this. I keep telling myself consistency is key. That really is true in all aspects of parenting. Had I promised him ice cream and he had not behaved at the doctor, I would have had to explain that he didn't earn the ice cream. Maybe when he isn't a toddler I will have the ability to say, "if you misbehave at the doctor, I will make your life miserable." For now, a tantrum-free, cooperative visit to the doctor is well-worth a bowl of ice cream.
These technologies have been in use for industrial prototyping since the 1980s, but now steadily falling costs are bringing it within reach of consumers. In 2010 HP partnered with established 3D printer manufacturer Stratasys to become the first major vendor to sell desktop 3D printers, showing that 3D printing is entering mainstream professional use among designers and architects. According to Vyomesh Joshi, HP’s EVP in charge of its printing business, HP’s entry is also preparatory to a longer-term mass-market strategy in 3D printing.
The kindest of all the publishers who turned down The Salt-Stained Book sent me an email when I told her I’d decided to publish it myself. “I predict it will become a cult classic,” she said. I’d been deeply disappointed by her final refusal of the book. We liked each other personally and she’d expended time and trouble thinking about the book and offering suggestions. In the end, however, she had decided that she had to separate herself as an individual from herself as the CEO of a large and successful international publishing company. The Salt-Stained Book just didn’t fit the way they worked. “I can’t tell you how I wish we could have published it,” her message finished.
This is the third time I’ve done this – mainly so I can keep my certification renewed and it was a great chance to network and keep up with new stuff. It all comes under the banner of Equine Assisted Learning (EAL) or Therapy (EAT) which is becoming more widespread as therapy. Last time the training was in Austria and as I’ve said, this time was a bit of a trek. There’s a part two in the same place this summer, but I don’t think I’ll have the cash!

Paul proves his gospel is the true gospel by asserting that it came to him direct by a revelation from Jesus Christ.
The background was created using the Floating Reinker Watercolor technique with Peeled Paint, Scattered Straw and a touch of Forest Moss distress inks. I don't own any reinker, so instead I used my distress ink pads by pressing them onto an acrylic block. It's my first time trying out this technique and I'm in love! You'll be seeing more of this in a few of my future cards I already have sketched out. Although, they're more like messy indistinguishable scribbles than anything else lol.

The only other singer I feel moved to talk about is Nina Stemme as Leonore/Fidelio. I have never seen a bad word written about Stemme, especially from London audiences, and this was the first time I'd seen her live, so I was quite excited. And then very disappointed. I was near the front of the stalls and found it hard to hear her much of the time. I don't know if the direness of the production meant that she wasn't trying, as it's clearly a voice of some power and resource but the voice just seemed rather dry and didn't carry at all. Maybe she was having an off day. But like my recent Glyndebourne experience with Anna Gabler as Eva there was just no sense of line whatsoever. It's not that she's sacrificing line for textual clarity either, it just wasn't pleasurable to hear. I have heard her Strauss disc which is fine for the Salome excerpt and the Four Last Songs (though vocally doesn't compete with the leading rivals. The orchestra is amazing), but related problems arise in the last scene of Capriccio - the voice just powers through the thing without any regard for musical detail or the text, and the huge dramatic vibrato and tone just seems completely inappropriate for the role. In an interview she classifies herself as a lyric-dramatic soprano and there are indeed a lot of lyric roles in her repertoire but I would not want to hear her in a single one.
So, I am totally grateful that my house serves the Lord.
In an emergency, though, I can somehow function all right. Gratefully these do not happen often, as I crash hard afterwards.
I love these file dividers as soon as you open the folder you know what's in there. I use bulldog clips to keep the passports from moving around. You might not see but in the passport photo I have labelled the passports on the front. I do this so I don't have to open up all the passports to find the one that I want it saves so much time. It worked great when we went overseas last year.

As some of you know, I moved towards the end of last year. We didn't move very far away, but we still have new neighbors, a new church, and all the change and adjustment that goes along with that. That is why I thought the stamp, "Bloom where you are planted" would be perfect for my journal - as a reminder to make the best of change and new opportunities. The journal was made by embellishing a composition book, and I used the Cricut cartridge Kate's ABC's for the flower and the name plate.
i made a ton of this really yummy cranberry jelly from scratch for our holiday dinner, and i've been enjoying it every day since. on toast with breakfast, on sandwiches, or just by the spoonful like a jello fruit salad - very versatile. so i thought i'd share my recipe, i was pretty much winging it, but there are other similar recipes out there too.
I went yesterday morning and did a pretty good work out. Although... I managed to fall off the treadmill in a totally laughable manner.

Mirabeau is the kind of place where you can eat alone and feel totally at ease. Or you can show up with a group of 12 and they'll shove tables around to accomodate you. You can reserve but you don't have to. I never go in the morning but they serve a nice breakfast, I'm told--and I often see people lingering over coffee on the terrace, reading the paper, enjoying the late-morning sun and free WiFi. They have a loyal, local clientele but they treat strangers just as warmly.

Collecting your soul
Are we any different? When our circumstances squeeze us, so often we wonder if God is really “for us”, and we put him to the test in our prayers with a mentality that says, “If God is good, then surely he will ____________ for me.” God has told us that he is unchanging (James 1:17) and he has told us that “in him is no darkness at all” (1 John 1:5), so we can trust that he will always do what he says he’s going to do for us. We, on the other hand, are the ones with hearts that are “deceitful above all things, and desperately sick” (Jeremiah 17:9). Consequently, we should be suspicious of ourselves, not God. I know I’ve said this before, but we need to be a people who are asking open-ended questions of our hearts: “Why did I say that? What did I want when I did that? What does that kind of thinking reveal about where my priorities are? Is what I am telling myself reflective of God’s truth, or is it a lie?” Certainly we can go nuts with this and become morbidly introspective, but the point is not to know your heart with scary-specific precision. Rather, it is to expose your heart for what it is and then redirect it with God’s truth, pleading with him to help you break free from our world’s popular “just follow your heart” philosophy. I believe it is one of the enemy’s great ploys to keep us suspicious of the One on whom suspicion is wasted so that our spiritual eyes don’t see all the incriminating evidence that lies within. Church, let us pray for God to help us trust him and distrust ourselves.

Nearly every group has something positive to say about greenery, small and tame animals, flowers, and even the river. These spaces soothed their more negative feelings from other parts of their walk, leaving “serenity.” But I have the impression that the more unruly aspect of nature can unnerve city-dwellers, such as how a terrain that was difficult to traverse annoyed one of the groups.

Obama urges Congress to reach deal on debt ceiling: President Obama said in a prime-time speech Monday night that, unless Congress agrees quickly to a long- term increase in the federal debt ceiling, “we would risk sparking a deep economic crisis, this one caused almost entirely by Washington.” He asked Americans to urge their lawmakers in Congress to strike a deal on the issue. He said he would not agree to a short-term increase, as proposed by House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), saying it amounted to “kicking the can down the road.” He added: “We can’t allow the American people to become collateral damage to Washington’s political warfare.”

In a large, deep skillet, heat the quarter cup of olive oil over medium heat. Add the kale stems and cook for two to three minutes, or until they are softened. Add the onion and garlic and sprinkle with a small amount of salt. Then add the water and cook this mixture until the vegetables are thoroughly tender but not mushy, about ten minutes. You will need to stir this mixture as it gets to the end of the cooking time to prevent the vegetables from sticking to the pan.
By the time mom and I came to our own showdown I’d had a lot more experience with losing friends and people who might otherwise have felt love for me. So when she asked “Why are you doing this to me?” it didn’t kill me. It stung me hard, but not to death. I am sorry though for the distress I caused her. That was never my intent. I wasn’t trying to do anything to her; I was just trying to do something to me.
Overall it worked very well. The original severity was eased fairly quickly, and by Sunday evening I was significantly better, and then well enough to go back to work on Monday.
One in eight women will get breast cancer sometime in their lives. That’s the worst math ever, if you ask me. It shouldn’t be ignored.

On its surface – the “plain sense” of the text, if you will – this passage seems to be a broadside against same-sex intercourse of both genders. The problem starts with idolatry, then gets worse and worse until God essentially gives up and lets them do what they want, after which everyone starts sleeping with everyone else and the natural consequence of that behavior is a host of other sins and moral failings.

One major impact the church has experienced is in the creation of new job functions and titles. This has been necessitated by the recognition that increasing numbers of people, including church members, are engaging on FB, twitter, Google + , Pinterest and other social media platforms and networks. Effectively engaging and interacting with these individuals requires the creation of a dedicated approach, e.g., employing social media teams, to creatively connect the church with this burgeoning online community. Indeed, the congregation is emerging as a new and savvy online community with unique needs, expectations, and requirements!

I just seems like it keeps getting worse. Once returning from home, I also found out that a game I play online called World of Warcraft got hacked into. I lost a lot of items in the game and it's not important to me. It's a game. BUT it does make me concerned about if I have a virus or a key-logger on my computer and if it can pose a threat to my financial accounts that I do online. So I had to promptly cancel credit cards as a precaution and money is so tight, it's not even funny. I am also concerned about all the photos that I have online of my Mom, taken in this last year. I lost my saved phone messages from Mom about three weeks ago, and it broke me down in tears. I don't want to lose anything else, especially if it's in regards to my mom/parents. Then to add salt to all these wounds, is the fact of how my MIL left her will, and it's left my husband feeling hurt, confused and wondering if his own mother even cared about him.

Prince William reminds me so much of his mother (not that I ever knew her personally, of course.) His mannerisms, the shy way he looks out of the corner of his eyes when waving, his smile, etc. As a couple, though, the new Prince and Princess have no resemblance of Prince Charles and Princess Diana as a couple. Prince William and his bride seem very comfortable, albeit a bit nervous, and in love, just like a newly married couple should be. Prince Charles and Princess Diana? Not so much. They were both very stiff and it just seemed forced. That marriage was a semi-happy beginning (mainly for the bystanders) that had a very sad, and then tragic ending.

Alan Bass and I have known each other since 2007, when we both started writing for a sports website called Bleacher Report. We quickly became friends, though the relationship was, and still is, a severe case of love-hate, considering he is a die-hard fan of the Philadelphia Flyers, while I root for the New York Rangers. In the summer of 2008, that intensity led us to create an online hockey radio show for the Youcastr Network, which has since dropped its programming of all individual shows. From July to November of that year, we broadcasted weekly, interviewing a wide array of people such as New York Rangers radio announcer Kenny Albert, Tampa Bay Lightning radio announcer Dave Mishkin, Toronto Maple Leafs television announcer John Bowen, and members of the Philadelphia Flyers broadcast team for both television and radio, Jim Jackson and Keith Jones, as well as their pre-game anthem singer Lauren Hart. We were also able to land interviews with then-current Rangers goaltender Steve Valiquette, and later, Colin Wilson, future center of the Nashville Predators. In retrospect, it is hard to believe how much time we actually spent doing these shows, even though they were only around an hour long each, and working on individual episodes, which were difficult in themselves to produce, because we had to talk through Skype, since we live almost two hours apart from one another.

Abductions have also overlapped sectarian faultlines in Pakistan, and on March 25, 2011, for instance, at least 33 Shias belonging to the Turi tribe were abducted by TTP militants in an attack on a convoy of passenger vehicles in the Kurram Agency of FATA. Later on April 25, 2011, one of the abducted tribesmen, Haji Asghar Hussain Turi, was released after the militants received PKR 5.4 million as ransom. Three months later, on June 22, 2011, another 22 were released after paying a ransom of PKR 30 million. According to media reports, the remaining 10, who were in the custody of a local TTP commander ‘Noor’, had been killed and buried somewhere near the Pak-Afghan border. Their coffins, with the names of the dead inscribed on them, were sent to Parachinar two months later.

Cardamom futures ended with marginal loss on increased arrivals. Favorable climate in the growing region also supported to sentiments. However upcoming festival demand especially Ramdhan is expected to increased the demand in near future. And more demand from East Asian countries is expected during this period. According to last updates, average spot prices improved and traded near 659.21 per ton and arrivals are reported near 13 tons compared with 58 tons previous day. According to trade estimates production in India is slightly higher than 11000 tons. As per the estimates of spices board the production in Guatemala expected near 20000 tons. As per media sources , total arrivals during the current season from August 1 to June ,2011, stood at 10856 tons which is approximately six percent higher than last year arrivals.

I enjoyed the middle section, dealing with Rose’s relationship with her brother Joseph and his friend George, but I didn’t really understand George’s motivation for maintaining his relationship with this weird family (loopy mother, distant father, odd son and clingy/bonkers daughter). To start with he seems to take Joseph and then Rose on as science projects, but then he largely abandons Joseph to go off to University and seems almost to be toying with Rose’s affections, responding to her whenever she calls but never reacting to her clear adoration of him.

The move of the Australian Labor Party to the centre, and its embrace of neoliberal economics, has therefore come at a certain price for the party, even if those changes were largely inevitable as society evolved further and further away from the post-Industrial Revolution shape that it had during the 19th Century when the Labor Party was first established. A lot, if not most, Australian voters now see the Labor and the Coalition (Liberal/National) alternatives not as being radically different, but as being two versions of the same thing, and they are easily interchangeable.

As in Ancient Images, old films and atavistic rites both feature strongly, but they are much more satisfactorily integrated than in the earlier novel, in which the "lost" 1930s horror film, Tower of Fear, is little more than a McGuffin, and is certainly nowhere near as horrible as Tubby Thackeray's two-reelers from the teenies. Campbell's descriptions of the sadistic slapstick which Thackeray's opera both depict and apparently induce may amuse some; I found myself sympathising, for once in my life, with the British film censor. Lester's use of the internet as a research tool enables Campbell to add to his protagonist's woes with harassment on the Internet Movie Database by a troll who may be a ghost, and Campbell's habitual use of spidery and cobwebby images gains a new and disturbing sense of threat from the world-wide web.

What I found was a book that is great in helping you organize your ideas, pointing out what is important, what to leave out, and of course what to put in your story! It had pointers for how to handle dialogue. I know I enjoy well-written dialogue, but if it's not well written, I tend to skip over it. This is true not only for memoirs but for any book I read! There were suggestions on how to recreate a conversation that may have happened decades ago.

It's too easy to share emotion. If I want to hear about it, I'll pay for it.
The initial situation for Aladdin, in the Disney film of the same name, is being a “street rat”, stealing bread and running from the palace guards to keep out of trouble. He’s living on his own in an abandoned house in the center of Agrabah, and his only friend is Abu.

But that’s no reason to take it easy!! Krampus is out there. It’s not as easy as it was when we were kids, when the worst thing that could happen if you were bad was some coal. This guy doesn’t play around. While I think we’re mostly out of the woods this year, with St. Nicholas Day come and gone, but Krampus is crafty, so I for one am playing it safe and keeping watch until New Year’s. Apparently Krampus is a fan of schnapps, which is the best way to distract him. Other than that, I’d say avoid traveling through wooded areas alone, and using the phrase “long hair, don’t care” in any context. (I don’t think Krampus has a problem with that last one, but it sure bugs the hell out of me.)

Three of these cases were consolidated for argument and the other two were argued separately on other dates. Inasmuch as all of them present the same fundamental question which, in our view, is decisive, they will be disposed of jointly. For the same reason we will pass up the objection to the personality or sufficiency of interest of the petitioners in case G. R. No. L-3054 and case G. R. No. L-3056 and the question whether prohibition lies in cases Nos. L-2044 and L-2756. No practical benefit can be gained from a discussion of the procedural matters since the decision in the cases wherein the petitioners’ cause of action or the propriety of the procedure followed is not in dispute, will be controlling authority on the others. Above all, the transcendental importance to the public of these cases demands that they be settled promptly and definitely, brushing aside, if we must, technicalities of procedure. (Avelino vs. Cuenco, G. R. No. L-2821.) The petitions challenge the validity of executive orders of the President avowedly issued in virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 671. Involved in cases Nos. L-2044 and L-2756 is Executive Order No. 62, which regulates rentals for houses and lots for residential buildings. The petitioner, J. Antonio Araneta, is under prosecution in the Court of First Instance of Manila for violation of the provisions of this Executive Order, and prays for the issuance of the writ of prohibition to the judge and the city fiscal. Involved in case L-3055 is Executive Order No. 192, which aims to control exports from the Philippines. In this case, Leon Ma. Guerrero seeks a writ of mandamus to compel the Administrator of the Sugar Quota Office and the Commissioner of Customs to permit the exportation of shoes by the petitioner. Both official refuse to issue the required export license on the ground that the exportation of shoes from the Philippines is forbidden by this Executive Order. Case No. L-3054 relates to Executive Order No. 225, which appropriates funds for the operation of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines during the period from July 1, 1949 to June 30, 1950, and for other purposes. The petitioner Eulogio Rodriguez, Sr., as a tax-payer, an elector, and president of the Nacionalista Party, applies for a writ of prohibition to restrain the Treasurer of the Philippines from disbursing this Executive Order. Affected in case No. L-3056 is Executive Order No. 226, which appropriates P6,000,000 to defray the expenses in connection with, and incidental to, the hold lug of the national elections to be held in November, 1949. The petitioner, Antonio Barredo, as a citizen, tax-payer and voter, asks this Court to prevent “the respondents from disbursing, spending or otherwise disposing of that amount or any part of it.”

Finally, we need a charging dock to hold the constantly growing collection of gadgets. You can find them everywhere from Ballard to Pottery Barn, but they are bulky and pricey.

Western resources are not innately centralized, which makes seizing control of them and routing them through a central point more difficult. This has to be done legislatively and has to be justified by a universal benefit or a crisis. One example of this is FDR's Agricultural Adjustment Act which allowed the government to control wheat grown on a farm for private consumption. Another is nationalizing health care by routing the commercial activity of medicine through government organs. Both services and commodities can be controlled in this manner.

So, this morning I was feeling especially good and naturally picked my longest route. This takes me to the Christian Community Center on T.W. Alexander and then back. Well, I got to T.W. Alexander and wanted to go further, but there aren’t many options at that point. The road is a split 4-lane affair, 6-lane when there’s turn offs. It’s basically a means of getting from South Miami to Glenwood avenue, so the traffic is quick and it can be dense, but since it wasn’t rush hour I knew that I could cross it. That’s when I spied the sidewalk on the other side, a sidewalk I didn’t know existed. I quickly crossed the road and then was stuck with the decision: left or right. Like Frodo I headed left and in some ways I too found Mordor in the name of Brier Creek.

One day, in the outside racks of the very best shop, (where an array of erudite paperbacks shuffle covers with the cheapest sci-fi and fantasy and where each volume can be bought for anywhere between 80 pence and the almost outrageously expensive rarity for £2. But the majority are for sale at £1 flat) I found, as I always do, a book or two that I know will amuse, interest or educate me. I handed over the five or six books that I had to rescue – for I do think of it as a rescue mission – if I don’t buy them who will? – and then, as the man behind the desk totted up the total (which I had already totted up but I didn’t tell him) I had a little poke through the little box that is kept at the side of the counter – containing books to replace the ones sold. The man saw me, knew me as a regular, and said: “We’ve got a whole warehouse of books. I could give you the key and you could look through them if you like.” I looked at him horrified. “Don’t destroy my life. This is my one pleasure. A few books now and then – well every week or so. That’s enough for me. And I don’t get round to reading even half of those.”

“The best butter tart I ever made,” says Sampson, “from a recipe by Canadian cooking icon Kate Aitken, was modest and pristine. She didn’t even believe in adding raisins. I’ll argue that the ideal tart has a fairly thick, shortbread-like shell. It tastes rich, but not greasy. It’s crumbly, but doesn’t fall apart at first bite. The filling has a buttery essence and a hint of maple for Canadian flair. It’s soft but not sloppy, sweet but not cloying. It’s covered by a slight crust that gives way as your teeth invade.”

Are you conserving and recycling water? As EFL, ESL or foreign language teaching professionals we ultimately have a responsibility to our learners, our adopted communities and ourselves as a form of social responsibility. We can quite easily, quickly and responsibly incorporate global, regional and local social issues into our class sessions to provide our language learners with an outlet for their English as a foreign language or other foreign language communicative skills. Pollution, crime, the environment, global warming and terrorism are all available topics of concern regionally and locally worldwide. Take water conservation for example.

Guided by David's trusty recommendations, we made it a mission to have gelato and/or ice cream everyday. First off was Amorino, with locations scattered all around the city, most of which we judiciously visited. Unfortunately, Amorino's foreign customer service needs serious improvement. While we were greeted with impatient rudeness each time we went, our friend -a local - flirtatiously chatted with the servers and got a custom, tulip-shaped, gelato for his efforts. If I had been born a handsome French male, I would have turned up the charm as well, but as it was the interactions between server and customer were perilous during our stay in Paris*.

At one of the HP locations where I worked there was a small on-site store that sold candy and soft drinks. Later they expanded to greeting cards and small gifts, and then they provided laundry and dry cleaning services. This expansion seemed like a good idea at the time, a way to save people from having to go off-site for little errands. It also meant more time working on-site. I’m sure many people saw this as a convenience. Others might have wondered if some of their balance was lost.

From the distance of decades, in reading the memoir, what struck Genevieve most was Obama’s description of the gravity of that library, and the vast distance between their worlds, and his conviction that he alone was the one who knew how to live as an outsider. She felt as estranged from that milieu as he did, and he knew it, and over the ensuing decades it was Barack, not Genevieve, who would move closer to presidents, diplomats, and industrialists, the world of an insider. “The ironic thing,” she noted, “is he moved through the corridors of power in a far more comfortable way than I ever would have.”
Maybe my own confusion goes back to my first paragraph. I would be the mom. Just the mom? What about the rest of me? Is that all I would be? Is being only a mom enough? Is there something wrong, even selfish about me if I am MORE than a mom? My head is spinning already.

It's more something that shows her that I'm okay with this, and M can work through the steps that are necessary.

It's easy enough to put together a good chatterer platter: I like at least one hard and one soft cheese, preferably one cow's-milk cheese and one goat's or sheep's milk cheese.

Sliced fresh baguette or good crackers is also a must.

I have another confession. I didn’t always keep up with Fuentes’s books, though it pleased me to no end whenever he commented on this or that, particularly about the United States. When the English-only movement caught fire in this country, Fuentes quipped: “Those poor Americans. They’re determined to be the only monolingual idiots of the twentieth century.” He called it as he saw it, and it didn’t matter who didn’t want to hear it because his was a voice with volume enough to crack the walls of pretense and false posture--on both sides of the border.

I wanted to show a bright red straw, but each time the straw passes through a layer it will get lighter since it has that much more "stuff" between it and the light. So my straw will be most vibrant outside the glass at the top, half vibrant where it passes through the cup, and less vibrant still where it enters the water. Again, notice where the straw meets a colored layer-edge I leave a tiny rim of the layer color visible. I also drew in a little line to show you better where the straw enters the surface of the water (really the straw would be visually bent and distorted from the angle of the light reflecting off the surface of the water, but we're not getting into that).

It's that time again...the biggest miniature show in the Chicago area. I decided to take a miniature flower class this year. I love miniature paper flowers and I think they'd be great to incorporate with your dolls. I took a class with Sandra Wall Rubin, a fantastic teacher. Talk about organized, she provided the most complete supply kit I've ever seen. Kemper tools, Swiss tweezers, two types of scissors, wire cutters, 3 different full size glues, Japanese silk papers, punched petals, sculpey, ink and chalk pads, applicators, fine point paint brushes, palette pads and on and on. She even made these great stem and flower holders from little wooden spools glued to a thin strip of wood. Take a look at the photo. You didn't need to bring a thing to class....and you got to keep ALL the supplies.
I am so distracted. I cannot concentrate on anything except adoption. This has happened to me before, but this is definitely the worst. I can’t even put everything I am feeling and thinking into words, but I will try. The main feelings I have are (1) anxiety; (2) desire and (3) fear. I am feeling anxious because I want the time to pass so that the kids get home. I am not content in the present, and I am somewhat unrepentant about it. Don’t get me wrong. I want to be content. I pray every day that God would fill me with peace, joy and contentment in my present circumstance, but my flesh is so weak. I am regularly giving in to my flesh and living in that discontentment. I don’t know whether it’s entirely sinful or whether it’s a holy anxiety, but whatever it is, it’s here to stay.

Around Thanksgiving that year (in Cananda we celebrate in October,) I added the little Nie Recovery box to my own site. I am not familiar with Nie Nie's blog as most of her followers were, but I am more than familiar with how tragedy can alter your life. I almost lost my (then two year old) son six years ago as he fell off my sister's deck over twelve feet onto cement and fractured the back of his skull. The doctors told me in the hospital that if he made it there would almost certainly be brain damage. When all you want is to see your baby survive, you don't really stop to consider what the implications of brain damage could be, nor do you have it in you to plan for those changes.

Divergent is an action-packed dystopia. It's exciting. It's compelling. It's impossible to put down. The futuristic Chicago setting has been well-crafted.

After all, someone had to do it wrong first (probably me) to give the better, opposite advice ;)
Maybe it’s broken in the Theme. I’ll except that excuse. Please fix it.
Thus I think that meaningful bicameralism in Westminster-style constitutional systems is bound to remain a dream, and attempts to realize it might turn into nightmares. It would be better, I think, to try to work on the hugely important issues Waldron is concerned about – legislative due process, executive domination of the legislature – by improving existing Houses of Commons (and unicameral provincial legislatures in Canada). Because, as Waldron notes, executives don’t like sharing power, this will be difficult enough.
1. Warm up for eight minutes. You can do whatever you like to get your heart rate up. Do some jumping jacks, jog in place or dance to your favorite song.
Moffatt’s Life of Jesus is actually a chronological composite of the four gospels, and each book chapter is prefaced by a short introduction and discussion of the events we are about to read. It is, essentially, the gospels rearranged and edited according to Moffatt’s understanding and preferences, with a few explanatory notes included.

But this season that was a struggle from the beginning. Juniors Matt Griffin, Patrick Hazel and Darryl Partin were all set to play after sitting out for a year in accordance with NCAA transfer rules. There were also six freshmen who had to adjust to college ball and just one senior in Holland to help guide them. To make matters worse Pelage was injured in one of the first scrimmages of the year.

For a day and a night the skiff slides onward over the ivory dust under a black sky. Ahead the black of night is broken on the horizon by a glow that grows steadily larger as they approach. Soon the squat, stone-walled town looms ahead, each of its parapets glowing with great burning braziers. A dry river-bed divides the city in twain, but only ultra-fine dust roils and sifts through it. The gates draw open as the sleigh comes near, and two guardsmen in shining silver caps and wielding long spears wave down as the sled passes inside the gates and skids to a halt on the cobbles.

So while other local groups come and go like the proverbial wind, or consistent groups made up of an open door “temporary players” situation seem to struggle to carry on from one week to the next, here I sit somehow blessed with a great group made up of four of us who have been there the entire three years, and three of us who are now on their (more or less) two year anniversary of play, well, what can I say? Sure, I bitched about some of the power/meta-gaming here and there (mostly because I was not used to being around it, these were mostly seasoned gamers compared to my 90's groups), but now we are used to each other and our particular peccadillo's. We know what we can get away with, and what we probably should not try to get away with unless you are Dan Dan The Power Game Man(tm). And it there is a certain security in the fact that we have to turn down at least one person a month who wants in the group because we are at maximum occupancy.

Another late evening. Soon to be night. I have a cup of peppermint tea and the movie Resident Evil: Degeneration. Don’t know why, but I feel like write a little about zombies tonight. I’ve watched, played and loved Resident Evil since I was about seven years old (I’m twenty-two now). Me and my then best friend watched my two older brothers play the very first game on ye olde Playstation, and since then I’ve been hooked. Not only to RE, but to everything that has to do with the infected. I can’t lie, I’m a bit terrified of zombies, especially of their noises, you know… the moaning, the sad, hungry screams… so creepy (♥). Anyway, I also love them and I’ve seen so many zombie/rage-movies. My all time favourite is 28 Days Later, since it’s very different from the others. It’s more “human”, interesting and realistic, at least in my opinion. Of course, the ending is a bit odd, in how the soldiers act, but yeah.
Avocado green, brown, buttery yellow, and the "50s" pink are the colors I used for this geometric print. I made a big stencil, and a few individual stencils to complete the look. It was fun, and a break from the norm!

The only one who doesn't have a pantheon of nicknames spilling out behind him is my brother TICH. His name was, and always has been, simplified to one letter. M. Later he became Mmmmmers. And is known as Uncle Mmmmmers to his many, many nieces and nephews. But he was just plain old M for the longest time.
Oh, and that lame spin from the left about the law's repeal being good for democrats and bad for republicans? Wow. Proof positive of democratic over reach and the downfall of Obama's signature achievement due to it's being unconstitutional is going to be bad for republicans, eh? Boy, they really are freaking out over on the left, aren't they? They must be tied up in knots to come up with such ridiculously twisted logic. It's almost a little sad, isn't it?
I ignored the flirt. This was a serious conversation. I was trying to avoid a future fight in a dressing room.
This is one of the agents one I met at a conference. She’s agreed to read ten pages. I have my summary, my pitch and my corrected pages. I’m good to go. I figure by the time she gets back to me, I’ll have the rest of the book corrected.
Perhaps the only thing better than being alone (when you allow it and acknowledge it and treasure it) is being with a love, and being alone and with someone at the same time. Those quiet moments where you both sip your tea, waking in the morning, rousing from sleep and finding someone's arm on your back. Truth be told, these moments exist more in the fictional realm of my memory (movies and novels and the like) than in past history, but I know it's out there. And I know it's worth waiting for.
For the same price, we can put four offenders through a drug court or reentry program and actually alter the course of their criminal careers. Research has shown that by using new technologies and treatment strategies, community corrections programs can cut rates of repeat offenses by 25 percent. Rather than claiming new victims, these offenders have a decent shot at rejoining society, paying taxes and supporting their children.
Keith Emerson takes centre stage for the ‘Piano Improvisations’ on disc two although don’t go expecting gentle music all the way through as after all this is the man who regularly stabbed his keyboards on stage with knives! ‘Karn Evil 9’ is the other highlight and contains the immortal lines captured in the album’s title (and also used on BBC TV’s ‘Generation Game’ when it was revamped by ELP fan Jim Davidson).
It’s AWESOME.
Of course, critics have pointed out that this would in no way be considered an acceptable argument in the context of domestic criminal behavior. Ted Kaczynski and Timothy McVeigh, for example, could not have been killed in an air strike without due process simply because arresting them was difficult.

In other news, I'm walking for the March of Dimes this year again. If you'd like to make a donation you can email me and I will send you the contact info. I understand money is tight right now for everyone. For the first time since Dylan was born I'm strapped and unsure of how much I will be able to donate. Next year, however, I'm organizing a Tricky Tray to benefit the March of Dimes and all proceeds are going towards team Loving Lily. It's a lot of work, but exciting because I know it's going towards a good cause. If anyone is interested or if they think their employers would be interested in donating something it's going towards a wonderful cause. The even it scheduled for April of 2011. So far we've contacted over 200 companies and have heard back from quite a few that they will be donating. You can donate items, gift cards, monitary donations...even things like paper plates, hot dogs, chips, baked goods for a bake sale...you name it! We need much more than just prizes. I'm trying to reach out to every single person in my network and hope that they will reach out to people in their network. Sometimes all it takes is someone who knows someone. Again, you can email me at cinderella20032@aol.com. Thank you in advance!

Here's a short little note to tell you that I am still alive and baking.
Lilia is a reader and writer of historical romance. While the Regency is her favorite era, she loves anything from the Revolution to the 1940s, with a special interest in American history. Her first novella, From Air to Eternity, was published by Night Shift Publishing in 2011. Her newest series,The Liberated Ladies, explores the lives of four very independent women in Georgian England. Lilia lives in New Bern, North Carolina.
For the twelve years since then, as predicted, I've had even more mess and noise and walks and poop to deal with. And yes, I've been the primary caregiver for Koko.
I have another friend that was starting to become a very good friend, but that friendship is stagnating. She started dating a man that we both know. He is a good man, but I don't want to be a third wheel and they are constantly together.

Dr. Hall said that Olivia is definitely "special." She said that she presents characteristics of CP and AMC, but not either by classic definition. Adding in low-functioning autism and a ton of "normal" test results, and she is indeed a mystery. She wants to be sure that the geneticists have tested for Rett's Syndrome, as she felt that Olivia had a lot of characteristics that match that disorder. We told her that we were fairly certain that genetics had tested for that already, and she said she would contact them to be sure.

Additionally, the music was good, and at times brought to mind the Inception trailer’s famous BBBRRRRMMMMM (also known as Mind Heist by Zack Hemsey). The movie was shot beautifully, and certainly created a suffocating environment inside the elevator. The PG-13 rating may cause some to pause, but the film cleverly uses what it doesn’t show you to its advantage. Every time the lights flicker, you will find yourself full of dread, gritting your teeth and straining not to cover your eyes. I have not seen a movie in some time that has pulled off that effect with such aptitude.
For one of my MAT classes we were given the task of "learning something new." The perimeter was vast, so I can basically do anything. I thought about learning to play guitar and writing a song for the final. or finally sewing that tie-skirt... I have all the ties! Haha... I decided on a million and one things in the two weeks I had to think about it before I needed to make a decision, but finally I made my choice.
Sure. I’m currently writing a new book working with the same editor... the wonderful Stacey Barney at Putnam. My new book is completely different. Different characters, different story, and that’s exciting. And scary. I lived inside the world of Harbinger for so long...it’s strange to step into a new story. But honestly, there is nothing more fun than to get lost inside a world that you’re creating!
Nick rolled his eyes. “You just need to … harness the power.”
Now, simply put, most people who make this decision (and there are a lot of us) will go quietly. They will not tell anyone why they are going, and they will not say anything for fear of backlash.

APPLE made a big educational announcement last Thursday. In case you were busy, here is a nice summary of their announcement. Click here.
I started thinking about this in detail. If I speak The Word of God, and it is based on truth, then why am I accused of being judgmental? After all, it was truth verbatim from the Scriptures. If I was asked, and merely responded with non-judgmental or accusatory truth by going to a specific verse to show precisely what God’s word says, why was I labeled as judgmental? Did I judge? Nope. Did I search my heart, motives, and pray to make sure, double-check, triple check, and pray again to make sure I checked correctly to be certain I didn’t come across at judgmental? You bet! I was in a frenzy to understand how I could possibly have been thought to be judgmental when reciting a verse of Scripture.

In 1964 around 65,000 children were born outside marriage in Britain. In 2005 the figure was around 275,000 – and every year 50,000 UK children have the father’s name left blank on their birth certificate.

Above all, I am here, along with so many others, to help the Goatmother BUTT THE HAY out of this monster. With five hard and angry goat heads, one very determined fireball of a Goatfather, two dogs willing to bite this thing in its sorry (pardon my goat) ass, and a whole passel of the most wonderful beings walking the face of this beautiful planet, that is exactly what we are going to do. We have received an offer from The Snowcatcher to use her bicycling-forged thunder thighs to kick butt, an offer from a herd of misguided pygmy goats over at 'Ewww! What's On My Shoe', (who have first hand knowledge of this monster themselves), and oh, so many other capable assassin types. We may even enlist Darla, the world's best dressed goat over at The Goat Borrower, to design a lovely canceresque goat cap. Hay, it could happen! And I can't leave out the fabulous Goatfarmer and all my friends over at my birthplace, This Goat's Life, CoraBelle and her minions at Life Beyond the Sidewalks, the goat boys and other critters at On the Way to Critter Farm (who just went through something similar themselves), Millie and everyone at Eden Hills, and I am sure I have forgotten someone. (And these are just the bloggers ... there are so many more. As I said we will never be able to repay them all.) But if I forgot, please forgive. The brain is rather mush right now. ( I think it may be because we had to endure the Goatfather trimming our hooves. Trust me, it was as much a chose nouvelle for him as it was for us. But more likely the brain mush is due to a lack of Peanuts. I'm just sayin'.... One has to keep up one's strength in the face of adversity.)
The strange thing is for someone so physically active I don't want to learn to dance Flamenco myself.
The elevators, off in their own hallway, are an earlier version of panoramic elevators, except the view is inside the shaft while you wait outside the glass door for the elevator’s arrival. I close my eyes, hang on tight to Mom’s hand and try not to think of freefalls.

Gladys hefted the book in her hand and opened it to the middle. It looked well worn but pretty boring. She sighed shut the book and pushed it to the side of her desk. She looked around the room at her fellow pupils and saw that they too were nonplused by the bulky volume. She shrugged and took a piece of brown paper bag from her stack and began tightly wrapping the book. She took her blue green, lemon yellow, and magenta crayons and began designing her name in on the cover. She wrote out each letter in one color then outlined it in the next making sure that her name could be read while still having flair.
In contrast with nearly every other major comic figure to come out of vaudeville (Chaplin, Fields, Allen, Marx, Williams), Laurel exhibited next to no intellectual pretensions, inclinations or abilities. He lived breathed, ate, and slept gags. Hearing him speak in interviews is a bit shocking. The fact of the matter is, he was like many ballet dancers, opera singers and classical actors – a practitioner of a complex “high” art who shocks you by being an otherwise ignorant and superficial person. In reality, a philosophical nature and book smarts can be a hindrance to a performing artist. While Fred Allen and Groucho Marx were without peer in the delivery of lines, neither could act his way out of a paper bag. Chaplin’s intellectuality eventually alienated him completely from his audience. Stan never tried to do more than connect with an audience and audiences were grateful.

But its’ all about how wise we are and for what purpose are we using these sites. I remember the very famous song by police, ‘every step you take, every move you make, I’ll be watching you’ whenever I think of Facebook and Twitter. Yeah, we can observe and remain updated of everything people have been doing through these sites. But despite of so many advantages, there are some shortcomings as we. Good and bad comes together, they say. The same is in the case of these networks as well.

The cloud forests and lowland rainforests of Ecuador. Full of life, full of movement, full of sounds never heard before. You may not get to see all the life contained within these mystical forests, but you will certainly get to hear much of it. The toucans call to each other from the tops of the trees, while the Inca jays click and rasp back and forth, these harsh sounds interspersed with clear, bell like notes that puncture the heavy, humid air. A noisy group of oropendolas invade first one tree and then another, constantly chattering, their song a liquid harmony, like fresh water bubbling up in a small, refreshing spring, starting on its journey down a mountain creek on its way to bigger, faster streams to eventually join that mighty river, the Amazon.

A group of officials arrived and advised the head of the household ,who went out to see them, that they were not to tell anyone about what had taken place. However, with the death of the parents, the story has now been told. A full report will, of course, be contained in Volume 6 if we can get the events of 1977 into that particular volume.
On a related note, Michelle Bachmann’s eyes, which are so piercing, yet so seemingly focussed a few degrees off from the subject, have always made me think of an absent minded witch. She, like Perry, I am sure have already appeared in some folk tale or another, in the guise of destructive monsters from which one might be saved because they forgot what they were supposed to destroy that day.
