So, whose responsibility is it to control the animals? Not the Humane Society. It is the animal owner. You see, when you have an animal, it is your responsibility, and mine (I adopted a wonderful puppy-mill dog) to make sure that it is treated with respect and love, that training is not discipline and consequences, that it takes its place in society and learns to live with human beings. It is our responsibility to make sure that its rights are met: those rights of food and water, shelter from the elements, love and compassion, safety, medical care and education. If we cannot provide these, we have no business having a pet or any other animal.

Allowing packs of dogs to chase bears and bobcats for miles until, exhausted, the animals climb trees to flee the canines and end up trapped and clinging to a tree limb, essentially waiting to be shot by a hunter below, is indeed a cruel practice, an animal version of "The Hunger Games."

Once an animal is treed, it's hardly more sporting to shoot it off a branch than it is to kill it during a captive hunt — in which animals are fenced in for an organized hunt and unable to escape, a practice mostly prohibited in California.

Why? Wealthy people and their children are more likely to live in safe neighborhoods, afford healthy food, have health insurance and access to top doctors and hospitals, as well as more leisure time that allows them to engage in healthy activities such as exercise, McCurdy and others said.

Tapalpa: A refreshing alpine town in the Western Sierra Madre mountains known as the "Land of Colors," 90 miles southwest of Guadalajara, the smallest (population 5,000) yet probably the best-known of these satellite venues has been one of Mexico's Magic Pueblos since 2002. Among its cobblestone streets and white houses crowned by red tile roofs, the city's traditional pilas, or community fountains, still stand; residents come to mingle with friends as they fill their buckets with water. The imposing, 17th century San Antonio Parish Church is Tapalpa's best-known attraction, but its definitive version of al pastor-style lamb (barbecued on a spit) runs a close second. Visitors can also rent cabins in the woods and ride through the oak and pine forests on horses rented by the locals. The abundant supply of wood — Tapalpa built western Mexico's first paper mill in 1840 — is the primary source of local handicrafts, producing carved decorative pieces and furniture.

Part of the answer is a bill sponsored by U.S. Sens. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. The Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals (FRAC) Act would amend the Safe Drinking Water Act's definition of "underground injection" to include fluids used for hydraulic fracturing. That would force gas-drilling operations to meet Safe Drinking Water Act standards as well as requiring public disclosure of the chemicals used in the process.

The charter adopted by voters in 2009 says the law director will be the "legal advisor and representative" of the executive and council.

But does last night's game really not count? I saw an interesting comment yesterday morning in John Hunt's preview story, one that said it wouldn't be a big game if OSU lost, because that's what's supposed to happen. If they won though, that would be the second time they upset the Ducks in Eugene when the Ducks were ranked higher. It's weird how sports work like this, where often many people don't pay attention unless the underdog wins, and how it's not considered a big game unless the little guy wins.

So that's fine by me if Bill O'Reilly and Gingrich (and all the rest) want to wallow in their homophobic male fantasy of San Francisco values. Sex between two men is normal. Sex is normal. Pundits and politicians want to scare people with San Francisco values because they don't fundamentally believe sex is healthy. They're the dinosaurs, and we're the meteor.
Also, the $50 sum will remain bolted in for good, meaning it will be worth less with inflation in years ahead. The one-size-fits-all nature of a parcel tax hits owners of low-value lots harder than owners of more costly ones, an essential unfairness.

The credit doesn’t cover installation costs, but you must install them before Jan. 1. Plus, the credit has a lifetime cap of $500, including $200 for windows, so if you took the credit after 2005, it’ll count against you in 2011. This credit used to be more generous (30 percent with a higher cap), so it might not be worth lining up a contractor to get this stuff in this month.

As it happens, the United States does not have a free market in labor - free market, as in letting anyone from any country walk in and take a job without proper documents.

While R.J. Vanecko undoubtedly did not mean to kill David Koschman, this case was not handled like a normal police matter. We know that thanks to the relentless reporting of the Sun-Times' Tim Novak and Chris Fusco who, in the last nine months, have uncovered "missing" police files, omissions of critical information that were crossed out of a detective's notes, and the unbelievable absence of any record, notation, or log entry at the Cook County state's attorney's office memorializing prosecutors' involvement in the case - even though it had been asked to consult with police.

Fernandez, 52, is a native of Santiago. He arrived in Chicago three weeks ago after serving similar posts in Mexico and Europe. "Our identity is not only Hispanic, we are from every place in the world," Fernandez said. "Asian, a number of Arabs and Palestinians. Yugsoslavia. Germany." Be on the lookout for the roadside Bavaria restaurant chain. Schnitzel and breaded pork steaks are served at Bavaria restaurants, whose yellow and red roadside signage replicate Denny's.

Unfortunately, other countries around the globe are passing us by in the development of human capital. I see particular gaps in our education system around points of transition: transitions from home to school, from grade school to high school, from high school to college, and from school to the work force. I think this is especially true for individuals who are not on a typical college degree track. We must respond to this challenge by improving pre-K and K-12 education; by providing greater support for math, science and engineering in higher education; and by increasing funding for basic research. Making such investments is imperative if manufacturing is to have a robust future in the United States, let alone Northeast Ohio. Let's resolve to meet this challenge.

The Mexican and U.S. governments signed a memorandum in July that Mexico would drop $1.5 billion in tariffs immediately and the remaining $1.5 billion five days after the United States issues the first license to a Mexican trucking firm to cross the border. The trucks must meet EPA emissions standards, the drivers must demonstrate knowledge of English and U.S. road rules, and the trucking companies must install on-board recorders. Two firms have applied, and approval of the first could come within two weeks, said a U.S. Department of Transportation official Thursday.

Ashley Wheater, artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet and therefore student of the rigid classical dance that would seem to be the polar opposite of Bausch's experimentalism, heartily agrees. "She's a giant in the expressionistic dance world, to the point I'd love to bring some of her work to the Joffrey, and we're trying to do it." That would have a full-circle quality to it: Robert Joffrey's revival of the 1932 "The Green Table," by Bausch's mentor, Jooss, broadened Jooss' reputation in America. It returns this fall.
TIP: Vitamin D is present in only a few foods, like fatty fish and fortified milk, and without a daily dose of sunshine, a supplement is a good idea for many of us.

There’s a reason the Ravens have had success signing undrafted free agents who go on to become impact players. Generally, director of player personnel Eric DeCosta said, there are 20 to 25 players on the team’s 150-man board who go undrafted.

Is this good for businesses? Is this good for cash strapped families? Most of all, is this fair, equitable and non-discriminatory?

He has moved ahead of Darryl Strawberry on one of the franchise’s most noted offense lists, with 735 runs batted in. He did it in a strangely odd way, too.

If Eliezer is a fussy minimalist, son Uriel very much sees the big picture. Beautifully played by Israeli star Ashkenazi, who grew an impressive beard for the part, Uriel is a born schmoozer who writes expansively and conceptually on what the Talmud might mean without worrying overly much about the specific words, an approach that is anathema to his father. It's clear that he cares more about the father-son relationship than the older man does.

Arsenic and beryllium both occur naturally in soil and rocks, and they're found at low levels in the slag or waste products left over after burning coal or processing copper ore. Long-term or repeated exposure over years to the toxic inorganic form of arsenic has been linked to cancer of the bladder, lungs and other parts of the body. Beryllium is carcinogenic as well, but inhaling small amounts of the metal dust also can cause chronic beryllium disease, a pneumonia-like condition involving breathing difficulty, weakness and possible heart problems.
Kildee, who grew up to become the Genesee County treasurer, points to yards he used to play in and struggles to recall families now gone.

But Judge Rodriguez disagreed.

Some confuse heritage pigs with endangered breeds. While some heritage pigs are endangered, many are widely raised by small farms across the United States. Heritage breeds are the pigs that were once owned by small farms everywhere. They lived as part of the natural cycle of the farm. Pigs were often used to help root out fields, allowed to forage in the forest, fed scraps from the table and skim milk or whey from the cow and eventually became juicy bacon for the table. However, when we had the bright idea to mass produce pork, pigs weren't well suited for the task, so specific breeding developed pigs that were at least more tolerant of living in uncomfortable, cramped quarters.
