Novitzky, who in fact did attend that 2008 congressional hearing, will return to the stand Monday, when the trial resumes.
Warfield was sent to the Dolphins for their first pick, the third overall, in the 1970 draft. The Browns' rationale for the trade was that they had to groom a quarterback to eventually replace their Pro Bowl QB, Bill Nelsen, whose knees were getting worse game by game. Cleveland used the pick to draft Purdue star QB Mike Phipps. Phipps replaced Nelsen one game into the 1972 season and led the Browns to a 10-3 record the rest of the way and a playoff berth. Cleveland was on the verge of the playoffs the next year before losing its last two games, and the Browns were a combined 7-21 in 1974-75.
The nation's second-largest off-price retailer -- Ross Stores -- is entering this market with at least two Ross Dress for Less stores already in the works. The Pleasanton, Calif.-based company has signed leases to open in the shuttered Linens 'n Things locations in Chesterfield and Fairview Heights. And retail brokers say the chain is still looking for more locations in the area.

The hat is Lincoln's size and was made by his Springfield hatter. But the only evidence that he actually owned it consists of an 1958 affidavit from a woman who says her Illinois father-in-law, William Waller, obtained the hat from Lincoln "during the Civil War in Washington."

Flunking out of school is not the end of the world. I am not pretending it is pleasant. It was not. But you learn from it and move on.
Paia: A funky post-hippie beach town of hemp clothing shops, organic food stores and, for my money (and lots of it), the best fish restaurant in the islands. Though just a few minutes’ drive down Highway 36 from the airport at Kahului on Maui, Paia is most often overlooked by Maui visitors. The town is a compact stretch of somewhat weather-worn, early-20th century storefronts housing an oddball collection of antique dealers and curio shops. One-of-a-kind gifts are sold at the Maui Crafts Guild.
As the second day of storm cleanup ended, residents dealt with tasks smaller than those of previous days.

His case is one in a series involving more than 40 people — politicians, rabbis and even an alleged black market kidney peddler — who were swept up on money laundering and corruption allegations in a massive FBI sting in July 2009. The key to the sting is Solomon Dwek, a former developer from Deal who worked as a prolific undercover informant for the government after he was arrested in a $50 million bank fraud.
“You better be aggressive,” he said. “Every time you walk onto that field, you better be aggressive. That is a young guy trying to make a play.”
Then it was on to the pizza with prosciutto di Parma ($13), which told us everything about Smulewitz's style -- gossamer-thin crust, blistered and perfectly crisp. Toppings are simple: a thin layer of tomato sauce, just enough cheese and thin, salty slices of prosciutto. Because the pizza's not overburdened, every flavor comes through. It reminded me of the first pizza I ate in Italy, outdoors near Todi's piazza.
Many Latino-heavy school districts say the recession already has pushed many of their families out of state to look for work. The passage of Senate Bill 1070, which widens enforcement of immigration law, has tipped the balance for some parents who tried to stick it out.

Federico fell in love with the angel hair pasta in spicy vodka sauce. “It will change your life,” she said. The spicy vodka sauce and the cream sauce in the pappardelle ai porcini, in fact, would turn out to be her two favorite sauces of the day. And Friedeman named the pappardelle the day’s best pasta dish.
"If there’s any doubt in anyone’s mind to give this guy up, we want to give them all the financial reasons to do it," Ryan said.

The Tigers were just hoping they found a way to make the title game and take their shot.
Executive produce Linda Schuyler co-created the "Degrassi" franchise — "Degrassi High" fans will note the presence of Dayo Ade, who played BLT, as a record producer — and, like those series, "The L.A. Complex" is gently instructive without being moralizing or sensational. Actions are shown to have consequences, but there is a matter-of-factness to it all that can seem even a little radical in its unwillingness to judge. And there are no villains.
Worse, I don't have very strong opinions on this. I could think of a variety of criteria you could use to choose a vice president. You can seek to amplify your narrative, as Bill Clinton did when he chose another young, moderate Southerner. You can try and compensate for a weakness, as John Kerry did in choosing the charismatic John Edwards and George W. Bush did in choosing the grave, experienced Dick Cheney. You could try and win a state, though the last successful example of this strategy was Johnson capturing Texas for John F. Kennedy. You could simply choose someone you trust to run the country, as the fictional Jed Bartlett did when he told his vice president to stay on the ticket because "I could die."
Yes, bulky blockers in the mold of Cross still have a place in the NFL, but today’s premier tight ends — Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez of the New England Patriots, Vernon Davis of the San Francisco 49ers among them — are world-class athletes with track speed, basketball-player hops and sculpted physiques. They are hybrids, able to block when necessary and catch passes from a variety of spots, from split out on the outside or in the slot as wide receivers to their traditional spot on the line.
Compared to the likes of Johnny Cash and Tom Waits, local favorite the Levee Drivers are coming back to Triumph in New Hope, Pa., where their down-home sound matches the down-home brews.

Days after the hearing, the Democratic and Republican leaders of the committee asked the Justice Department to open an investigation into Clemens' testimony.
Cardinals were about to start a stretch of interleague games with a visit to Chicago to face the defending World Series champion White Sox. David Eckstein, then the Cardinals' shortstop, was a veteran of such foreign clashes, viewing interleague from the side with the designated hitter, and he offered one question to define the American League's advantage when the National League came to town.
Fifty-three percent said they were either "very concerned" or "somewhat" concerned. An additional 46 percent said they were "not very" or "not at all concerned." One percent said "not sure."

More than 70 Israeli companies have a presence in New Jersey, including Teva, which already has 300 employees in Woodcliff Lake and Fairfield.
Smith is holding out hope that a different decision will be made down the road - a sharp contrast to Court Drive resident Ann McMunn. She rebuilt her house after it was destroyed by the tornado. She was a vocal opponent of any plan that could lead to commercial development in her neighborhood.
"We've had a long partnership, which has given women lifesaving access to exams and treatment," she said. "It muddies the water to draw the abortion debate into this, because it's about preventive care."

It was popularized in the '20s by polo players, who wore it between chukkers and after matches. Although the six-button double-breasted model with a half-belt was considered the classic polo coat, variations include the wraparound style with no buttons and a tied belt. Right now, polo coats are not easy to find, so either try a vintage store or wait for the next revival.

If Sandoval and Posey can be All-Star caliber with a good-fielding infield that doesn't kill them at the plate, Melky Cabrera and Angel Pagan could prove to be great additions at the top of the Giants' lineup  and in left and center field, respectively.
entrance there's a new 'splash pad" where jets of water squirt artistically from the smooth, red, stone floor. The water spray is soft and gentle, and the floor has no edges to harm bare feet, so even young children can play while parents watch from shaded benches.

Soriano yielded a single and an RBI grounder, a night after the Rays scored four runs in the ninth off fill-in closer David Robertson. Yankees manager Joe Girardi said he wasn't going to use Robertson for a third straight day, but was OK to do it with Soriano.
All of those little things added up to a lot when the defense failed to register a sack and when a unit that was tied for the national lead in turnovers produced didn’t come up with one until 2:08 remained.
Movies were shown there for a while, but then it went unoccupied for some time, the seats were removed and a silkscreen business moved in. Later, a yarn shop operated in it for a number of years.
He was a famous violinist. Came here on tour but never lived here. Died in 1880. Norwegians put up the statue on a plinth so tall you have to crick your neck to behold the great artist, and the statue's enormous; last time I saw something metallic that size it was fighting with Optimus Prime in a "Transformers" movie.
Walker became the target of a recall election after he pushed through legislation last year eliminating most public union workers' bargaining rights. His showdown with labor leaders and their Democratic allies made him a celebrity in Republican circles and enabled him to rake in campaign cash at a pace never before seen in Wisconsin.
"We'll double Merck medicines in (late-stage development) to 18," Clark added.
Frank Luzecki sat on the front steps of his home, a former railroad building in Beach Haven, watching tourists and residents pack up and leave. He plans to stay through the storm, mostly because he said he doesn't have anywhere else to go and doesn't want to go to a shelter. He said he's lost three cars to floods during the 31 years he's lived on the island and has even marked a nearby utility pole in foot-increment measurements to show how high the water has reached during various storms.
Christie, who has praised Wallace’s intellect and integrity, said today the justice is out and that’s final.
For years, survivors told their children and grandchildren about the endless shaking and the sea that surged far ashore. Most stories eventually were lost, and Native peoples, without a written language, forgot that that earthquake had ever struck the region.
It’s worth mentioning that the Blue Danube has a small, full-service bar and cheerful, knowledgeable servers.
Adding to potential worries, Apple and five book publishers were accused by the Justice Department of colluding to raise e-book prices. Apple has called the allegations "simply not true."

Hey, Kevin: Anyone can pick the Phil Mickelsons, Luke Donalds, Dustin Johnsons or Nick Watneys of the world and that includes me. But, how about Ernie Els? He was in the top five last year and one of his two Open titles came at Congressional, the site of this year's Open. I think Matt Kuchar has a chance too.
Nerburn, a Minnesota Book Award winner and author of more than a dozen books, responded kindly. "Why 2:30? I don't know. Did I think it was strange? Not at the time. When you drive a cab, the stories of a single night could fill a book. It's a wonderful experience for drinking in humanity."

Previously, the city allowed up to 10 licenses there for the sale of liquor by the drink for consumption on the premises.
My personal pet peeve is plastic bags. On a windy day, they blow all over the place. Plastic bags take up space in the landfill and don't bio-degrade. Consumers should shop with reusable bags and always recycle plastic bags. What also helps is when consumers use all the recycling services available to them curbside. Food scraps and yard waste are compostable and both Alameda and San Francisco counties provide this service. Singlestream recycling is an easy way for consumers to keep paper, plastic containers, glass bottles, aluminum and metal cans out of the landfill and ensure they are recycled for new uses.
The cause of the kill remains unknown, and Graham said officials found no "blatantly obvious" signs in the water.
"These cases are prosecuted on what we're doing," Williams said. "If we were doing anything illegal or inappropriate, (the state and county Attorney's Office) wouldn't prosecute these cases."
I work for a newspaper, so I know a thing or two about the Internet eating your lunch. But inflicting more junk mail on people couldn't possibly be the answer to keeping the Postal Service afloat. Higher rates, yes. New services, yes.
In the second incident, a girl, 13, reported a man in his early 30s approached her about 6 p.m. April 24 near the intersection of Glendenning Drive and West Oakland Road behind the Bay Middle School.

The second girl described the man as having a thin goatee and mustache. The man was driving a four-door sedan, either black or dark blue in color with a dark interior, according to police.
That provided little solace, however. Niedringhaus deemed the report "so unfair and so unnecessary," but she said Network and the conference believe in dialogue and want to work with church leaders on a solution.

In a groundbreaking 2010 study, a third of people consuming 200 grams of HFCS a day -- what you'd get in seven 20-ounce bottles of soda -- developed metabolic syndrome in two weeks. Yes, two weeks.

Greg Oden -- a consensus pick, until he wasn't -- has been a puzzling disappointment. The Blazers lost more than 300 combined games to injuries this season. They were booted in the first round of the NBA playoffs by the Phoenix Suns. And while that was all going on, it should not be lost that ownership was busy meddling with the operation, as if firing warning shots a week before the playoffs began was going to help the franchise gain focus.
Review Zocalo's soon-to-debut new menu -- and better still, sample some of Sanchez's prototype dishes -- and you'll notice the shift. Into the existing bill of fare he has installed bright lights like his sopes, small tarts made of fine cornmeal dough or masa, then filled with a mellow black bean paste, topped with a swirl of crema fresco, a tomatillo salsa, shaved lettuce and cojito cheese. And a pair of Caesar salads (an early 20th century Tijuana creation), as well as a delicious ceviche featuring shrimp bathed in a marinade of charred tomatoes, chiles, avocado and lime. It's a tangy, smoke-scented bath that brings out the sugar sweetness of the seafood.

øInstead of potentially making it a two-score game and keeping Brady on the bench, the Giants punted after Eli Manning couldn't connect with Mario Manningham on third-and-10.

I don't personally know all the moms in town, but probably know most of them by sight. Curious, I clicked. It was no one I had ever seen. Giving it the benefit of the doubt, I read on. In the body of the supposed "blog" the alleged author said she was from "Raritan, New Jersey" and she had lost a bunch of weight with magical little acai berries. Smelling a rat, I called my best friend in Florida and asked her to click on the same ad. For her it showed up as "Miami Mom Loses 41 Pounds" - although it showed the same picture and name.

Long, one of those phenomenal "national search" products, of course was an awful choice, proving to be about as exciting as his teams, which lacked structure, maturity, discipline and conditioning.

To be fair, the 240-yard hole was playing tough, second on this day only to No. 1.

Fitting the Ravens: Linebacker is a position of uncertainty for the Ravens. Lewis will be back for a 17th season, but it might be time to look for his long-term replacement in the early rounds, especially if Jameel McClain leaves as a free agent. Outside linebacker Jarret Johnson is a free agent, too, and Dannell Ellerbe is restricted. We don’t know how much longer Lewis plans to play, but his future could dictate whether the Ravens draft an inside linebacker in April.

What high school sports mean to me: The high school gymnastics experience is a lot of fun, and I love the team aspect because in club it's very individual.

When I made this observation to Greg Cantu, wine director of Grüner restaurant in Portland, Ore., he laughed. "I don't believe there is such thing as job security for sommeliers," he said. Mr. Cantu is a big fan of German Riesling and has quite a few on his wine list, though naturally there's a lot of Grüner Veltliner as well. Mr. Cantu said that people come looking for both Riesling and Grüner, though they seem to be more comfortable ordering the latter on their own. "You have to provide an explanation," he said of the Riesling, though Mr. Cantu believes this is changing: "I think it's getting easier and easier for people to figure it out on their own." He cited all the available tools—online sources and tablet applications—as well as German winemakers who now use English words.

Two new hotels have raised the bar for service, style and sophistication. Stylish Mexicans bored with colonial digs now flock to the new ultra-modern Hotel Matilda. Sleek white buildings filled with contemporary art, including photographer Spencer Tunick’s shot of thousands of nude people gathered in Mexico City's Zócalo, frame an infinity pool and sun deck, and the restaurant and bar draw chic locals along with guests. The new Rosewood San Miguel de Allende reflects the city's traditional setting with massive rose-hued limestone colonial-style buildings, stone columns, arched porticos, splashing fountains and gleaming hardwood floors. The 67-room hotel is at the heart of Rosewood's residential compound of 29 luxurious private homes in one of San Miguel's wealthiest enclaves.

The all-wheel-drive system sends more power to the outside wheel during cornering, which theoretically benefits handling balance. That's a pretty advanced feature at this price: Acura and BMW employ the technology on $30,000-plus luxury cars. Alas, temperatures at our Chicago offices hovered below freezing when we had the Juke, so we couldn't toss the car around enough to properly evaluate the all-wheel drive. I did put the Juke through its paces on the snow- and ice-covered streets, though, and the driveline sent power to all four wheels pretty seamlessly, with none of the spinning tires and lagging power transfers I've experienced with some all-wheel-drive systems.

"Advocates on both sides of the debate have tended to take extreme positions. Numerous utopian communities have been founded to put egalitarian principles into practice. Few of them have lasted longer than one generation. Children have a regrettable tendency to rebel against their parents' dreams. Meanwhile, advocates of extreme free-market capitalism have been preaching the gospel of greed. They glorify greed as the driving force that creates new industries and, in the end, will make everyone wealthy. Unfortunately, in many parts of the world where free-market capitalism prevails, the rich are growing richer and the poor are growing poorer."

Most of the apps available currently are geared toward Walt Disney World, including Disney's own app for Verizon phones, but a handful are available for other attractions, too.

The app proved to be particularly useful during a visit to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction at Islands of Adventure, where wait times for the signature ride tend to be much longer than in other areas of the Universal parks.

It would come over him in spasms, as if he had been stunned by a Taser. But he also spoke of the loneliness that had pervaded his life.

He had come to accept it, yet he explained to me as I prepared to leave: “Being unable to walk is not the hardest part.
